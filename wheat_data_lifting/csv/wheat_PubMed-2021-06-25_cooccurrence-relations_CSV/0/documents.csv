"28159297","articletitle","Validation and application of a quantitative real-time PCR assay to detect common wheat adulteration of durum wheat for pasta production."
"28159297","abstracttext","Pasta is the Italian product par excellence and it is now popular worldwide. Pasta of a superior quality is made with pure durum wheat. In Italy, addition of Triticum aestivum (common wheat) during manufacturing is not allowed and, without adequate labeling, its presence is considered an adulteration. PCR-related techniques can be employed for the detection of common wheat contaminations. In this work, we demonstrated that a previously published method for the detection of T. aestivum, based on the gliadin gene, is inadequate. Moreover, a new molecular method, based on DNA extraction from semolina and real-time PCR determination of T. aestivum in Triticum spp., was validated. This multiplex real-time PCR, based on the dual-labeled probe strategy, guarantees target detection specificity and sensitivity in a short period of time. Moreover, the molecular analysis of common wheat contamination in commercial wheat and flours is described for the first time."
"23374069","articletitle","Aegilops tauschii single nucleotide polymorphisms shed light on the origins of wheat D-genome genetic diversity and pinpoint the geographic origin of hexaploid wheat."
"23374069","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, genomes AABBDD) originated by hybridization of tetraploid Triticum turgidum (genomes AABB) with Aegilops tauschii (genomes DD). Genetic relationships between A. tauschii and the wheat D genome are of central importance for the understanding of wheat origin and subsequent evolution. Genetic relationships among 477 A. tauschii and wheat accessions were studied with the A. tauschii 10K Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Aegilops tauschii consists of two lineages (designated 1 and 2) having little genetic contact. Each lineage consists of two closely related sublineages. A population within lineage 2 in the southwestern and southern Caspian appears to be the main source of the wheat D genome. Lineage 1 contributed as little as 0.8% of the wheat D genome. Triticum aestivum is subdivided into the western and Far Eastern populations. The Far Eastern population conserved the genetic make-up of the nascent T. aestivum more than the western population. In wheat, diversity is high in chromosomes 1D and 2D and it correlates in all wheat D-genome and A. tauschii chromosomes with recombination rates. Gene flow from A. tauschii was an important source of wheat genetic diversity and shaped its distribution along the D-genome chromosomes."
"30697120","articletitle","QTLs for agronomic traits detected in recombinant inbred lines derived from a bread wheat × spelt cross."
"30697120","abstracttext","Spelt wheat ( Triticum aestivum subsp. spelta ), a subspecies of common wheat, is a genetic resource for the breeding of bread wheat ( T. aestivum subsp. aestivum ); however, genetic analyses of agronomic traits in bread wheat × spelt crosses are insufficient. Here, we conducted QTL analysis in the recombinant inbred lines from a bread wheat × spelt cross. In addition to the major Q locus, QSpd.obu-4D was detected with the spelt allele conferring a higher spikelet density than the bread wheat allele. The effect of QSpd.obu-4D was evident in the presence of the Q allele of bread wheat, suggesting that this variation might be cryptic in spelt wheat with the q allele. Two QTLs with stable effects were identified for grain length, one of which ( QGl.obu-1A ) has never been detected in a bread wheat × spelt cross. The spelt wheat allele at QHt.obu-7B conferring later heading was identified in the Vrn-B3 region and could be a novel gene source for modifying heading time. Furthermore, QGi.obu-2B , responsible for low grain dormancy of spelt wheat, was detected. Further exploration and identification of useful QTLs could accelerate the utilization of spelt wheat as a genetic resource for bread wheat breeding programs."
"11999846","articletitle","Trends in comparative genetics and their potential impacts on wheat and barley research."
"11999846","abstracttext","We review some general points about comparative mapping, the evolution of gene families and recent advances in the understanding of angiosperm phylogeny. These are considered in relation to studies of large-genome cereals, particularly barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), with reference to methods of gene isolation. The relative merits of direct map-based cloning in barley and wheat, utilization of the smaller genome of rice (Oryza sativa) and gene homology methods that utilize information from model species such as Arabidopsis thaliana are briefly discussed."
"28490951","articletitle","Gene introgression from common wheat into Aegilops L."
"28490951","abstracttext","Group of experiments were carried out to verify possibility of gene introgression from common wheat into Aegilops . The artificial indoor crossbreed was conducted using 7 genotypes from 4 wheat relative species as female, and common wheat as male. The experiment result shows that different species has variable cross ability. Among the 4 Aegilops species, the highest cross rate is from the combination of Aegilops tauschii  ×  Triticum aestivum (46.49% for genotype Ae42, 22.58% for Y92), the second is from Aegilops ovata  ×  T. aestivum (14.76% for Y100, 12.11% for Ae23), the third is from Aegilops cylindrica  ×  T. aestivum (2.23% for Ae7, 8.50% for Y145), and the lowest is from Aegilops speltoides  ×  T. aestivum (0.19%). Hybrid embryos from different combinations have different ability of callus initiation and germination. The hybrid embryos from A. ovata / T. aestivum and Ae. tauschii / T. aestivum have a higher level of callus initiation and germination. Ae. cylindrica / T. aestivum has a middle level, while the Ae. speltoides has a lower level. The interspecific hybrids between Aegilops and common wheat have so low fertility. In back-crosses, the seed-set rate of hybrids of Ae. ovata / T. aestivum is 3.71% and 4.36% respectively back-crossed with male and female parents, while for hybrids of Ae. cylindrica / T. aestivum , they were 0 and 0.33% respectively, and for Ae. tauschii / T. aestivum , 0.33% and 0 respectively. On selfing of the hybrids, the seed-set rate is 0 (no seed set from 9750 florets) for the combination of Ae. cylindrica / T. aestivum , 0.044% (3 selfed seeds out of 6870 florets) for Ae. ovata / T. aestivum and 0 (no seed set from 7253 florets) for Ae. tauschii / T. aestivum . The research suggests that the probability of gene introgression from T. aestivum into Aegilops species is very low in nature."

"15604827","abstracttext","Developing seeds from Triticum aestivum (wheat) cultivars were collected after flowering and analysed for puroindoline a and b gene expression by Real Time RT-PCR. Mature seeds were investigated for the presence and the amount of starch-associated puroindoline a and b proteins by flow cytometry. Puroindoline a gene and protein were found to have a predominant role in controlling wheat kernel hardness."
"1653627","articletitle","Sequence and tissue-specific expression of a putative peroxidase gene from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"1653627","abstracttext","We have used a cDNA clone encoding a pathogen-induced putative wheat peroxidase to screen a genomic library of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Cheyenne) and isolated one positive clone, lambda POX1. Sequence analysis revealed that this clone contains a gene encoding a putative peroxidase with a calculated pI of 8.1 which exhibits 58% and 83% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of the turnip (Brassica rapa) peroxidase and a pathogen-induced putative wheat peroxidase, respectively. The two introns in the wheat gene are at the same positions as introns in the peroxidase genes of tomato and horseradish. Results of S1-mapping experiments suggest that this gene is neither pathogen- nor wound-induced in leaves but is constitutively expressed in roots."
"12952555","articletitle","Genetic transformation of Indian bread (T. aestivum) and pasta (T. durum) wheat by particle bombardment of mature embryo-derived calli."
"12952555","abstracttext_background","Particle bombardment has been successfully employed for obtaining transgenics in cereals in general and wheat in particular. Most of these procedures employ immature embryos which are not available throughout the year. The present investigation utilizes mature seeds as the starting material and the calli raised from the hexaploid Triticum aestivum and tetraploid Triticum durum display a high regeneration response and were therefore used as the target tissue for genetic transformation by the biolistic approach."
"12952555","abstracttext_results","Mature embryo-derived calli of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, cv. CPAN1676) and durum wheat (T. durum, cv. PDW215) were double bombarded with 1.1 gold microprojectiles coated with pDM302 and pAct1-F at a target distance of 6 cm. Southern analysis using the bar gene as a probe revealed the integration of transgenes in the T0 transformants. The bar gene was active in both T0 and T1 generations as evidenced by phosphinothricin leaf paint assay. Approximately 30% and 33% primary transformants of T. aestivum and T. durum, respectively, were fertile. The transmission of bar gene to T1 progeny was demonstrated by PCR analysis of germinated seedlings with primers specific to the bar gene."
"12952555","abstracttext_conclusions","The transformation frequency obtained was 8.56% with T. aestivum and 10% with T. durum. The optimized protocol was subsequently used for the introduction of the barley gene encoding a late embryogenesis abundant protein (HVA1) in T. aestivum and T. durum. The presence of the HVA1 transgene was confirmed by Southern analysis in the T0 generation in case of Triticum aestivum, and T0 and T1 generation in Triticum durum."
"12182084","articletitle","Molecular cloning, characterization and mapping of a rhodanese like gene in wheat."
"12182084","abstracttext","To isolate genes related to resistance to Erysiphe graminis (Blumeria graminis) DC. f. sp. tritici in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), differential display analysis was conducted for mRNA extracted from seedlings of a wheat-Haynaldia villosa 6VS/6AL translocation line 92R137 that contains a powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21. A full-length cDNA sequence named TaTST (Triticum aestivum thiosulfate sulfurtransferase) homologous to the thiosulfate sulfurtransferase (rhodanese) in Datisca glomerata was isolated. Northern blot showed that the expression of TaTST was enhanced after infection with Erysiphe graminis. TaTST was mapped on the short arm of 6B chromosomes of wheat through Southern blot and GSP-PCR using Chinese Spring nullisomic/tetrasomic lines and ditelosomic lines. There is a homologue of TaTST on 6VS too."
"16697246","articletitle","Wild sex in the grasses."
"16697246","abstracttext","To date, alien introgression of agronomically important traits into bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) from wild relatives has not been readily achievable through traditional breeding practices. However, this door might now be unlocked. The insightful research published recently by Graham Moore and his team delivers a likely candidate in the form of a cdc2-kinase-related gene family for the Ph1 locus--a chromatin region located on chromosome 5B that is responsible for homologous chromosome pairing integrity in bread wheat."
"7948904","articletitle","A chimeric gene (orf256) is expressed as protein only in cytoplasmic male-sterile lines of wheat."
"7948904","abstracttext","Mitochondria derived from Triticum timopheevi have a chimeric gene, orf256, immediately upstream from coxI. Antibodies to a peptide corresponding to a part of the encoded amino acid sequence of orf256 detect a 7 kDa protein on western blots of mitochondrial proteins from cytoplasmic male-sterile (cms) wheat (T. aestivum nucleus, T. timopheevi mitochondria) but not in mitochondrial proteins from T. aestivum, T. timopheevi, or cms plants restored to fertility by introduction of nuclear genes for fertility restoration. The 7 kDa protein appears to serve as a marker for cms wheat. Its occurrence as an integral protein of the inner membrane may indicate a cms effect through an influence on mitochondrial membrane function."
"12060759","articletitle","Genes encoding plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-phosphoglycerate kinase of the Triticum/Aegilops complex and the evolutionary history of polyploid wheat."
"12060759","abstracttext","The classic wheat evolutionary history is one of adaptive radiation of the diploid Triticum/Aegilops species (A, S, D), genome convergence and divergence of the tetraploid (Triticum turgidum AABB, and Triticum timopheevii AAGG) and hexaploid (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) species. We analyzed Acc-1 (plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase) and Pgk-1 (plastid 3-phosphoglycerate kinase) genes to determine phylogenetic relationships among Triticum and Aegilops species of the wheat lineage and to establish the timeline of wheat evolution based on gene sequence comparisons. Triticum urartu was confirmed as the A genome donor of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. The A genome of polyploid wheat diverged from T. urartu less than half a million years ago (MYA), indicating a relatively recent origin of polyploid wheat. The D genome sequences of T. aestivum and Aegilops tauschii are identical, confirming that T. aestivum arose from hybridization of T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii only 8,000 years ago. The diploid Triticum and Aegilops progenitors of the A, B, D, G, and S genomes all radiated 2.5-4.5 MYA. Our data suggest that the Acc-1 and Pgk-1 loci have different histories in different lineages, indicating genome mosaicity and significant intraspecific differentiation. Some loci of the S genome of Aegilops speltoides and the G genome of T. timophevii are closely related, suggesting the same origin of some parts of their genomes. None of the Aegilops genomes analyzed is a close relative of the B genome, so the diploid progenitor of the B genome remains unknown."
"6861746","articletitle","The amino-acid sequence of a purothionin from Triticum monococcum, a diploid wheat."
"6861746","abstracttext","Purothionins were extracted and purified from the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum. Two proteins were obtained, one of which was present in only very small amounts. The major purothionin of T. monococcum was sequenced and it had an amino acid sequence identical with that of the beta-purothionin of Triticum aestivum (hexaploid bread wheat). It is known that T. monococcum contains the wheat A genome, so the structural gene coding for the beta-purothionin must comprise a part of the A genome. There have been no observable (as amino acid replacements) changes in the DNA comprising either the beta-purothionin gene of T. aestivum or the purothionin gene of T. monococcum, since T. monococcum (or its wild equivalent, Triticum boeoticum) hybridized with the diploid wheat B genome progenitor and started the evolution from diploid to allohexaploid wheat. All of the investigated characteristics of the purothionin-like protein isolated in small amounts suggested that it was essentially identical in amino acid sequence with the T. monococcum purothionin. It may be a dimerized form of beta-purothionin."
"18024553","articletitle","Recurrent deletions of puroindoline genes at the grain hardness locus in four independent lineages of polyploid wheat."
"18024553","abstracttext","Polyploidy is known to induce numerous genetic and epigenetic changes but little is known about their physiological bases. In wheat, grain texture is mainly determined by the Hardness (Ha) locus consisting of genes Puroindoline a (Pina) and b (Pinb). These genes are conserved in diploid progenitors but were deleted from the A and B genomes of tetraploid Triticum turgidum (AB). We now report the recurrent deletions of Pina-Pinb in other lineages of polyploid wheat. We analyzed the Ha haplotype structure in 90 diploid and 300 polyploid accessions of Triticum and Aegilops spp. Pin genes were conserved in all diploid species and deletion haplotypes were detected in all polyploid Triticum and most of the polyploid Aegilops spp. Two Pina-Pinb deletion haplotypes were found in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum; ABD). Pina and Pinb were eliminated from the G genome, but maintained in the A genome of tetraploid Triticum timopheevii (AG). Subsequently, Pina and Pinb were deleted from the A genome but retained in the A(m) genome of hexaploid Triticum zhukovskyi (A(m)AG). Comparison of deletion breakpoints demonstrated that the Pina-Pinb deletion occurred independently and recurrently in the four polyploid wheat species. The implications of Pina-Pinb deletions for polyploid-driven evolution of gene and genome and its possible physiological significance are discussed."
"16675504","articletitle","Molecular characterization of a diagnostic DNA marker for domesticated tetraploid wheat provides evidence for gene flow from wild tetraploid wheat to hexaploid wheat."
"16675504","abstracttext","All forms of domesticated tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum, genomes AABB) are nearly monomorphic for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotype a at the Xpsr920 locus on chromosome 4A (Xpsr920-A1a), and wild tetraploid wheat is monomorphic for haplotype b. The Xpsr920-A1a/b dimorphism provides a molecular marker for domesticated and wild tetraploid wheat, respectively. Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, genomes AABBDD) is polymorphic for the 2 haplotypes. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones hybridizing with PSR920 were isolated from Triticum urartu (genomes AA), Triticum monococcum (genomes AmAm), and T. turgidum ssp. durum (genomes AABB) and sequenced. PSR920 is a fragment of a putative ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter gene (designated ABCT-1). The wheat ABCT-1 gene is more similar to the T. urartu gene than to the T. monococcum gene and diverged from the T. urartu gene about 0.7 MYA. The comparison of the sequence of the wheat A genome BAC clone with that of the T. urartu BAC clone provides the first insight into the microsynteny of the wheat A genome with that of T. urartu. Within 103 kb of orthologous intergenic space, 37 kb of new DNA has been inserted and 36 kb deleted leaving 49.7% of the region syntenic between the clones. The nucleotide substitution rate in the syntenic intergenic space has been 1.6 x 10(-8) nt(-1) year(-1), which is, respectively, 4 and 3 times as great as nucleotide substitution rates in the introns and the third codon positions of the juxtaposed gene. The RFLP is caused by a miniature inverted transposable element (MITE) insertion into intron 18 of the ABCT-A1 gene. Polymerase chain reaction primers were developed for the amplification of the MITE insertion site and its sequencing. The T. aestivum ABCT-A1a haplotype is identical to the haplotype of domesticated tetraploid wheat, and the ABCT-A1b haplotype is identical to that of wild tetraploid wheat. This finding shows for the first time that wild tetraploid wheat participated in the evolution of hexaploid wheat. A cline of the 2 haplotype frequencies exists across Euro-Asia in T. aestivum. It is suggested that T. aestivum in eastern Asia conserved the gene pool of the original T. aestivum more than wheat elsewhere."
"12783334","articletitle","Vernalization-induced flowering in wheat is mediated by a lectin-like gene VER2."
"12783334","abstracttext","A vernalization-related gene VER2 was isolated from winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) using a differential screening approach. The deduced VER2 is a lectin-like protein of 300 amino acids, which contains the presence of a jacalin-like GWG domain. RNA in situ hybridization results demonstrated that VER2 gene expression is restricted to the marginal meristems of immature leaves in vernalized wheat seedlings. No hybridization signal was detected in the epidermal tissue and vascular bundles. However, ""devernalization"" resulted in the silencing of VER2 gene activity. The gene expression pattern of VER2 induced by jasmonate was similar to that induced by vernalization. Antisense inhibition of VER2 in transgenic wheat showed that heading and maturation time were delayed up to 6 weeks compared with non-transformed wheat and the pBI121empty-vector-transformed wheat. Tissue degeneration at the top of the spike was also noticed in the antisense inhibited transgenic wheat. These results suggest that VER2 plays an important role in vernalization signaling and spike development in winter wheat."
"25809604","articletitle","Thinopyrum ponticum chromatin-integrated wheat genome shows salt-tolerance at germination stage."
"25809604","abstracttext","A wild wheatgrass, Thinopyrum ponticum (2n = 10x = 70), which exhibits substantially higher levels of salt tolerance than cultivated wheat, was employed to transfer its salt tolerance to common wheat by means of wide hybridization. A highly salt-tolerant wheat line S148 (2n = 42) was obtained from the BC3F2 progenies between Triticum aestivum (2n = 42) and Th. ponticum. In the cross of S148 × salt-sensitive wheat variety Chinese Spring, the BC4F2 seeds at germination stage segregated into a ratio of 3 salt tolerant to 1 salt sensitive, indicating that the salt tolerance was conferred by a dominant gene block. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis revealed that S148 had a single pair of Th. ponticum-T. aestivum translocated chromosomes bearing the salt-tolerance. This is an initial step of molecular breeding for salt-tolerant wheat."
"24178111","articletitle","Association of a DNA marker with Hessian fly resistance gene H9 in wheat."
"24178111","abstracttext","The Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] is a major pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and genetic resistance has been used effectively over the past 30 years to protect wheat against serious damage by the fly. To-date, 25 Hessian fly resistance genes, designated H1 to H25, have been identified in wheat. With near-isogenic wheat lines differing for the presence of an individual Hessian fly resistance gene, in conjunction with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis and denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis (DGGE), we have identified a DNA marker associated with the H9 resistance gene. The H9 gene confers resistance against biotype L of the Hessian fly, the most virulent biotype. The RAPD marker cosegregates with resistance in a segregating F2 population, remains associated with H9 resistance in a number of different T. aestivum and T. durum L. genetic backgrounds, and is readily detected by either DGGE or DNA gel-blot hybridization."
"8425048","articletitle","Cytoplasmic male sterility and fertility restoration in wheat are not associated with rearrangements of mitochondrial DNA in the gene regions for cob, coxII, or coxI."
"8425048","abstracttext","In comparing the genetic organization and exploring the molecular basis of cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in wheat, mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNA) from Triticum aestivum, T. timopheevi, CMS alloplasmic wheat with T. aestivum nucleus and T. timopheevi mitochondria, and fertility-restored lines were compared by hybridization analysis with specific probes for three gene regions: coxII, cob, and coxI. Minor differences between T. aestivum- and T. timopheevi-derived sources were found for gene regions for coxII and cob. For coxI, there are significant differences between T. timopheevi-derived mtDNAs and T. aestivum mtDNA extending beyond an 8 kb distance. All T. timopheevi-derived mtDNA sources have a chimeric gene region (orf256) with part of the upstream coxI gene region, including some coxI-coding region, preceding coxI. The part of orf256 that does not include any of coxI and the 3'-flanking region of CMS coxI are not found in T. aestivum mtDNA. Neither orf256 nor the CMS 3'-flanking region of coxI are found in T. timopheevi or T. aestivum chloroplastic or nuclear DNA. There do not appear to be DNA sequence differences for the three gene regions studied that are related to either CMS or fertility-restored states."
"31628162","articletitle","The Transcriptional Landscape of Polyploid Wheats and Their Diploid Ancestors during Embryogenesis and Grain Development."
"31628162","abstracttext","Modern wheat production comes from two polyploid species, Triticum aestivum and Triticum turgidum (var durum ), which putatively arose from diploid ancestors Triticum urartu , Aegilops speltoides , and Aegilops tauschii How gene expression during embryogenesis and grain development in wheats has been shaped by the differing contributions of diploid genomes through hybridization, polyploidization, and breeding selection is not well understood. This study describes the global landscape of gene activities during wheat embryogenesis and grain development. Using comprehensive transcriptomic analyses of two wheat cultivars and three diploid grasses, we investigated gene expression at seven stages of embryo development, two endosperm stages, and one pericarp stage. We identified transcriptional signatures and developmental similarities and differences among the five species, revealing the evolutionary divergence of gene expression programs and the contributions of A, B, and D subgenomes to grain development in polyploid wheats. The characterization of embryonic transcriptional programming in hexaploid wheat, tetraploid wheat, and diploid grass species provides insight into the landscape of gene expression in modern wheat and its ancestral species. This study presents a framework for understanding the evolution of domesticated wheat and the selective pressures placed on grain production, with important implications for future performance and yield improvements.plantcell;31/12/2888/FX1F1fx1."

F1 hybrids of T. aestivum were also produced with A. intermedium (2n=42,E1E1E2E2Z1Z1) and A. junceum (2n=14,JuJu). All wheat-Agropyron hybrids were obtained by embryo rescue technique. Cultivars and reciprocal crosses differed for seed set, seed development and F1 plant production. The F1 hybrids were sterile. Attempts to obtain amphiploids were unsuccessful. However, backcross derivatives were obtained with wheat as the recurrent parent.The level of chromosome pairing in A. trachycaulum x wheat, A. yezoense x wheat and wheat x A. junceum hybrids provided no evidence of homologous or homoeologous pairing. Mean pairing frequencies in A. ciliare x wheat, wheat x A. scirpeum and wheat x A. intermedium hybrids indicated homoeologous or autosyndetic pairing. Ph gene was more effective in regulating homoeologous pairing in A. yezoense x wheat hybrids than in A. ciliare x wheat hybrid. Chromosome pairing data of BC1 derivatives indicated that either some of the wheat chromosomes were eliminated or Agropyron chromosomes caused reduced pairing of wheat homologues."
"24890396","articletitle","Transcript suppression of TaGW2 increased grain width and weight in bread wheat."
"24890396","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major staple crop in the world. Grain weight is a major factor of grain yield in wheat, and the identification of candidate genes associated with grain weight is very important for high-yield breeding of wheat. TaGW2 is an orthologous gene of rice OsGW2 that negatively regulates the grain width and weight in rice. There are three TaGW2 homoeologs in bread wheat, TaGW2A, TaGW2B, and TaGW2D. In this study, a specific TaGW2-RNA interference (RNAi) cassette was constructed and transformed into a Chinese bread wheat variety 'Shi 4185' with small grain. The transcript levels of TaGW2A, TaGW2B, and TaGW2D were simultaneously downregulated in TaGW2-RNAi transgenic wheat lines. Compared with the controls, TaGW2-underexpressing transgenic lines displayed significantly increases in the grain width and weight, suggesting that TaGW2 negatively regulated the grain width and weight in bread wheat. Further transcript analysis showed that in different bread wheat accessions, the transcript abundance of TaGW2A was negatively associated with the grain width."

The avirulence of Sk-1 on Triticum aestivum 'Norin 4', 'Chinese Spring', and 'Kokeshi-komugi' was controlled by a single gene. The resistance of the three cultivars to Sk-1 was also controlled by a single gene, Pm15, a gene for resistance to E. graminis f.sp. agropyri. Implications of these results were discussed in terms of host-parasite coevolution."
"17322337","articletitle","HKT1;5-like cation transporters linked to Na+ exclusion loci in wheat, Nax2 and Kna1."
"17322337","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) has a greater ability to exclude Na+ from its leaves and is more salt tolerant than durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum [Desf.]). A novel durum wheat, Line 149, was found to contain a major gene for Na+ exclusion, Nax2, which removes Na+ from the xylem in the roots and leads to a high K+-to-Na+ ratio in the leaves. Nax2 was mapped to the distal region on chromosome 5AL based on linkage to microsatellite markers. The Nax2 locus on 5AL coincides with the locus for a putative Na+ transporter, HKT1;5 (HKT8). The Nax2 region on 5AL is homoeologous to the region on chromosome 4DL containing the major Na+ exclusion locus in bread wheat, Kna1. A gene member of the HKT1;5 family colocates to the deletion bin containing Kna1 on chromosome 4DL. This work provides evidence that Nax2 and Kna1 are strongly associated with HKT1;5 genes."

"31521211","articletitle","The wheat SnRK1α family and its contribution to Fusarium toxin tolerance."
"31521211","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a mycotoxin produced by phytopathogenic Fusarium fungi in cereal grain and plays a role as a disease virulence factor. TaFROG (Triticum aestivum Fusarium Resistance Orphan Gene) enhances wheat resistance to DON and it interacts with a sucrose non-fermenting-1 (SNF1)-related protein kinase 1 catalytic subunit α (SnRK1α). This protein kinase family is central integrator of stress and energy signalling, regulating plant metabolism and growth. Little is known regarding the role of SnRK1α in the biotic stress response, especially in wheat. In this study, 15 wheat (Triticum aestivum) SnRK1α genes (TaSnRK1αs) belonging to four homoeologous groups were identified in the wheat genome. TaSnRK1αs are expressed ubiquitously in all organs and developmental stages apart from two members predominantly detected in grain. While DON treatment had either no effect or downregulated the transcription of TaSnRK1αs, it increased both the kinase activity associated with SnRK1α and the level of active (phosphorylated) SnRK1α. Down-regulation of two TaSnRK1αs homoeolog groups using virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) increased the DON-induced damage of wheat spikelets. Thus, we demonstrate that TaSnRK1αs contribute positively to wheat tolerance of DON and conclude that this gene family may provide useful tools for the improvement of crop biotic stress resistance."

"18469879","abstracttext","Alien cytoplasms produce a variety of phenotypes in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum) and common wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars, which indicate the prevalence of cytoplasmic variability in the subtribe Triticinae. Intraspecific cytoplasmic differences have been demonstrated between the subspecies of Triticum speltoides, Triticum dichasians, and Triticum comosum. In this study, durum wheat lines with cytoplasm from two accessions, B and C, of Triticum longissimum were compared, and meiotic chromosome pairing between the group 4 homoeologues from the same two accessions was examined in common wheat. First, monosomic addition or monosomic substitution lines of common wheat with cytoplasm and one chromosome (designated B) from accession B were crossed with those having cytoplasm and a chromosome designated C-1 or C-2 from accession C. In each substitution line, an alien chromosome substituted for a group 4 homoeologue. Each alien chromosome had a ""selfish"" (Sf) gene, which remained fixed in the wheat nucleus. The F1s had greatly reduced meiotic pairing between chromosomes B and C-1 and B and C-2, which indicated greatly reduced homology between the group 4 homoeologues from the two accessions. Second, by using Triticum timopheevii as a bridging species, chromosome B in a common wheat line was eliminated and an euploid durum line with cytoplasm from accession B was obtained. This line was fertile. In contrast, a similarly produced durum line with cytoplasm from accession C was male sterile and retained a species cytoplasm specific (scs) nuclear gene from T. timopheevii. In conclusion, nuclear and cytoplasmic heterogeneity pre-existed between accessions B and C and they represent varieties or incipient subspecies in T. longissimum. Alternatively, the Sf genes produced chromosomal heterogeneity and mutated cytoplasmic genes from one or both accessions. Key words : meiotic drive, selfish gene (Sf), gametocidal gene (Gc), Triticum, Aegilops."

"23154759","abstracttext","To develop a method for detecting GM wheat that may be marketed in the near future, we evaluated the proline-rich protein (PRP) gene as an endogenous reference gene of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum wheat (Triticum durum L.). Real-time PCR analysis showed that only DNA of wheat was amplified and no amplification product was observed for phylogenetically related cereals, indicating that the PRP detection system is specific to wheat. The intensities of the amplification products and Ct values among all wheat samples used in this study were very similar, with no nonspecific or additional amplification, indicating that the PRP detection system has high sequence stability. The limit of detection was estimated at 5 haploid genome copies. The PRP region was demonstrated to be present as a single or double copy in the common wheat haploid genome. Furthermore, the PRP detection system showed a highly linear relationship between Ct values and the amount of plasmid DNA, indicating that an appropriate calibration curve could be constructed for quantitative detection of GM wheat. All these results indicate that the PRP gene is a suitable endogenous reference gene for PCR-based detection of GM wheat."

It has been widely adapted as a fundamental platform to generate wheat plants with new traits and has become a powerful tool for facilitating the crop improvement. In this chapter, we present a complete and straightforward protocol for wheat transformation via biolistic bombardment system. Although wheat is still one of the hardest plant species to transform, this protocol offers an optimized and efficient system to produce transgenic plants. To demonstrate the application of this protocol, in this chapter we describe an example of obtaining transgenic wheat by the co-bombardment of two plasmids, containing a green fluorescent protein gene and a glufosinate herbicide selection gene, respectively. In addition, procedures for the screening and testing of putative transgenic plants are described. This protocol has been successfully applied to generate stable transgenic bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) in both spring and winter varieties."

"31311836","abstracttext","Centromeres mediate the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiosis; this pairing is particularly challenging for polyploid plants such as hexaploid bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), as their meiotic machinery must differentiate homologs from similar homoeologs. However, the sequence compositions (especially functional centromeric satellites) and evolutionary history of wheat centromeres are largely unknown. Here, we mapped T. aestivum centromeres by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing using antibodies to the centromeric-specific histone H3 variant (CENH3); this identified two types of functional centromeric satellites that are abundant in two of the three subgenomes. These centromeric satellites had unit sizes greater than 500 bp and contained specific sites with highly phased binding to CENH3 nucleosomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the satellites have diverged in the three T. aestivum subgenomes, and the more homogeneous satellite arrays are associated with CENH3. Satellite signals decreased and the degree of satellites variation increased from diploid to hexaploid wheat. Moreover, several T. aestivum centromeres lack satellite repeats. Rearrangements, including local expansion and satellite variations, inversions, and changes in gene expression, occurred during the evolution from diploid to tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. These results reveal the asymmetry in centromere organization among the wheat subgenomes, which may play a role in proper homolog pairing during meiosis."

The novel powdery mildew resistance gene, which has been designated Pm27, was shown to cosegregate with the microsatellite locus Xpsp3131, which is located on the introgressed T. timopheevii segment.

The Tm analysis of (32)P probes synthesized from the pTA250 regions and hybridized to DNA from the Triticum species provided an estimate of sequence change relative to T. aestivum. The results revealed a region of 1.2 kb preceding the 18S rRNA gene which was more conserved than the rest of the spacer. In addition the transcribed spacer between the 18S and 26S rRNA genes was shown to be poorly-conserved; the genes, as expected, were highly conserved. A model which proposes RNA as a co-factor in gene conversion is suggested to account for the observations."

Wheat mutants on which supernumerary spikelets (SSs) develop are particularly useful resources for work towards understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying wheat inflorescence architecture and, ultimately, yield components. Here, we report the characterization of genetically unrelated mutants leading to the identification of the wheat FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP) gene, encoding a member of the APETALA2/Ethylene Response Factor transcription factor family, which drives the SS trait in bread wheat. Structural and functional characterization of the three wheat FZP homoeologous genes (WFZP) revealed that coding mutations of WFZP-D cause the SS phenotype, with the most severe effect when WFZP-D lesions are combined with a frameshift mutation in WFZP-A. We provide WFZP-based resources that may be useful for genetic manipulations with the aim of improving bread wheat yield by increasing grain number."

"24989045","abstracttext","Subgenome integrity in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum; BBAADD) makes possible the extraction of its BBAA component to restitute a novel plant type. The availability of such a ploidy-reversed wheat (extracted tetraploid wheat [ETW]) provides a unique opportunity to address whether and to what extent the BBAA component of bread wheat has been modified in phenotype, karyotype, and gene expression during its evolutionary history at the allohexaploid level. We report here that ETW was anomalous in multiple phenotypic traits but maintained a stable karyotype. Microarray-based transcriptome profiling identified a large number of differentially expressed genes between ETW and natural tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum), and the ETW-downregulated genes were enriched for distinct Gene Ontology categories. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that gene expression differences between ETW and a set of diverse durum wheat (T. turgidum subsp durum) cultivars were distinct from those characterizing tetraploid cultivars per se. Pyrosequencing revealed that the expression alterations may occur to either only one or both of the B and A homoeolog transcripts in ETW. A majority of the genes showed additive expression in a resynthesized allohexaploid wheat. Analysis of a synthetic allohexaploid wheat and diverse bread wheat cultivars revealed the rapid occurrence of expression changes to the BBAA subgenomes subsequent to allohexaploidization and their evolutionary persistence."

"32697086","abstracttext","Cereals are a major dietary source of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd). Reducing Cd accumulation in cereal crops such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) is important for food safety and human health. In this study, we show that three diverse cultivars of wheat had a high Cd translocation from roots to shoots, similar to a rice ( Oryza sativa ) cultivar possessing a nonfunctional tonoplast Cd transporter OsHMA3. We investigated the function of TaHMA3 genes in wheat. Three TaHMA3 genes were identified in wheat, all of which encode tonoplast-localized proteins. However, heterologous expression of TaHMA3 genes in yeast showed no transport activities for Cd, which likely explains the low Cd sequestration in wheat roots and subsequently the high Cd translocation to wheat shoots. To increase Cd sequestration in wheat roots, we overexpressed a rice functional OsHMA3 gene in wheat driven by a strong constitutive Ubiquitin promoter. Overexpression of the OsHMA3 gene decreased root-to-shoot Cd translocation in wheat by nearly 10-fold and Cd accumulation in wheat grain by 96%. The results suggest that high Cd translocation is a common trait in wheat caused by a loss of the Cd transport function of TaHMA3 proteins. Transgenic wheat overexpressing a functional OsHMA3 gene offers a highly effective solution to decrease Cd accumulation in wheat grain."

Monococcum NADH NR gene heme-hinge regions were sequenced and compared with the barley NADH NR gene sequence. Sequence identity and phylogenetic analyses showed that one of theT. Monococcum NADH NR genes is more-closely related to the barley NADH NR gene than to the otherT. Monococcum NADH NR gene. The heme-hinge region of all three NR genes appeared to have evolved at a constant rate. These results suggest that the NADH NR gene duplicated before the divergence ofTriticum andHordeum and that a deletion resulted in the loss of one NADH NR gene from cultivated barley."

"16498469","abstracttext","Agropyron cristatum (2n = 4x = 28, PPPP) possesses potentially valuable traits that could be used in wheat (Triticum aestivum) improvement through interspecific hybridization. Homoeologous pairing between wheat chromosomes and P chromosomes added to wheat in a set of wheat - A. cristatum addition lines was assessed. First, the Ph-suppressing effect of P chromosomes (except 7P) was analyzed. It was concluded that this system is polygenic with no major gene, and consequently, has no prospect in the transfer of alien genes from wild relatives. In a second step, the potential of the deletion ph1b of the Ph1 gene for inducing P-ABD pairing was evaluated. Allosyndetic associations between P and ABD genomes are very rare. This very low level of pairing is likely due to divergence in the repeated sequences between Agropyron and wheat genomes. Development of translocation lines using ionizing radiation seems to be a more suitable technique than homoeologous recombination to exploit the A. cristatum genome in wheat improvement."

We cloned Sr33, which encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat protein. Sr33 is orthologous to the barley (Hordeum vulgare) Mla mildew resistance genes that confer resistance to Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei. The wheat Sr33 gene functions independently of RAR1, SGT1, and HSP90 chaperones.

"24386921","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important crops in the world. Squamosa-promoter binding protein (SBP)-box genes play a critical role in regulating flower and fruit development. In this study, 10 novel SBP-box genes (TaSPL genes) were isolated from wheat ((Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Yanzhan 4110). Phylogenetic analysis classified the TaSPL genes into five groups (G1-G5). The motif combinations and expression patterns of the TaSPL genes varied among the five groups with each having own distinctive characteristics: TaSPL20/21 in G1 and TaSPL17 in G2 mainly expressed in the shoot apical meristem and the young ear, and their expression levels responded to development of the ear; TaSPL6/15 belonging to G3 were upregulated and TaSPL1/23 in G4 were downregulated during grain development; the gene in G5 (TaSPL3) expressed constitutively. Thus, the consistency of the phylogenetic analysis, motif compositions, and expression patterns of the TaSPL genes revealed specific gene structures and functions. On the other hand, the diverse gene structures and different expression patterns suggested that wheat SBP-box genes have a wide range of functions. The results also suggest a potential role for wheat SBP-box genes in ear development. This study provides a significant beginning of functional analysis of SBP-box genes in wheat."

The wheat LEA gene family (TaLEA genes) was divided into eight subfamilies according to the conserved domains. All TaLEA genes contain very few introns (<3) and they are unevenly distributed on the 21 chromosomes. We identified 39 pairs of tandem duplication genes and 9 pairs of segmental duplication genes in the wheat LEA gene family. This proved that the tandem duplication and segmental duplication played an important role in the expansion of the TaLEA gene family. According to published transcriptome data and qRT-PCR analysis, the TaLEA genes exhibit different tissue expression patterns and they are regulated by various abiotic stresses, especially salt and cold stress. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the wheat LEA gene family."

"19104075","abstracttext","Effects of polyploidy in allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have primarily been ascribed to increases in coding sequence variation and potential to acquire new gene functions through mutation of redundant loci. However, regulatory variation that arises through new promoter and transcription factor combinations or epigenetic events may also contribute to the effects of polyploidization. In this study, gene expression was characterized in a synthetic T. aestivum line and the T. turgidum and Aegilops tauschii parents to establish a timeline for such regulatory changes and estimate the frequency of nonadditive expression of homoeologous transcripts in newly formed T. aestivum. Large-scale analysis of nonadditive gene expression was assayed by microarray expression experiments, where synthetic T. aestivum gene expression was compared to additive model values (mid-parent) calculated from parental T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii expression levels. Approximately 16% of genes were estimated to display nonadditive expression in synthetic T. aestivum. A certain fraction of the genes (2.9%) showed overdominance or underdominance. cDNA-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was applied to measure expression of homoeologous transcripts and further verify microarray data. The results demonstrate that allopolyploidization, per se, results in rapid initiation of differential expression of homoeologous loci and nonadditive gene expression in T. aestivum."

The previously unknown location of MITE in Triticum urartu and T. aestivum L. beta-amylase gene has been found. These species have a MITE sequence in the third intron of beta-amylase, as opposed to Aegilops comosa and a number of other Triticeae species, which have it in the fourth intron. These two MITEs from Ae. comosa and T. aestivum were shown to have low identity scores. Miosa, an artificial amphidiploid, which has the M genome from Ae. comosa was shown to lose the MITE sequences. This loss might be caused by genomic shock due to allopolyploidization."

The specificity was assessed on 17 monocot and dicot plant species. The established real-time PCR assay amplified only T. aestivum-derived DNA; no amplification occurred on other phylogenetically related species, including durum wheat (T. durum). The robustness of the system was tested on the DNA of 15 common wheat cultivars using 20 000 genomic copies per PCR the mean cycle threshold (Ct) values of 24.02 +/- 0.251 were obtained. The absolute limits of detection and quantification of the real-time PCR assay were estimated to 2 and 20 haploid genome copies of common wheat, respectively. The linearity was experimentally validated on 2-fold serial dilutions of DNA from 650 to 20 000 haploid genome copies.

Genetic analysis and deletion mapping revealed that the common wheat line contained a single locus for resistance, H31, residing at the terminus of chromosome 5BS. H31 is the first Hessian fly-resistance gene to be placed on 5BS, making it unique from all previously reported sources of resistance. AFLP analysis identified two markers linked to the resistance locus. These markers were converted to highly specific sequence-tagged site markers. The markers are being applied to the development of cultivars carrying multiple genes for resistance to Hessian fly biotype L in order to test gene pyramiding as a strategy for extending the durability of deployed resistance."

In this study, a salt-induced unknown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) gene was identified and cloned according to microarray analysis of salt-tolerant wheat mutant RH8706-49 under salt stress. The gene was named Triticum aestivum salt tolerance-related gene (TaSTRG) and submitted to Genbank (Accession number: EF599631). TaSTRG expression in wheat is induced by multiple stresses including salt, polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA), and cold. Transgenic rice plants overexpressing TaSTRG gene showed higher salt and drought tolerance than the control. Under salt stress, the transgenic rice had a lower intracellular Na(+)/K(+) ratio than the control. Under salt and PEG treatments, these TaSTRG overexpressing rice plants had higher survival rate, fresh weight and chlorophyll content, accumulated higher proline and soluble sugar contents, and had significantly higher expression levels of putative proline synthetase and transporter genes than the control plants. These results indicate that the wheat TaSTRG gene could enhance plant tolerance to multiple types of stresses."

In a previous work, we showed that the use of dephosphorylated cassettes for wheat transformation enabled the production of simple integration patterns. Here, we used the same technology to produce a cassette containing a 44-kb Arabidopsis thaliana BAC, flanked by one selection gene and one reporter gene. This 53-kb linear cassette was integrated in the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome by biolistic transformation. Our results showed that transgenic plants harboring the entire cassette were generated. The inheritability of the cassette was demonstrated in the T1 and T2 generation. Surprisingly, FISH analysis performed on T1 progeny of independent events identified double genomic insertions of intact fragments in non-homoeologous positions. Inheritability of these double insertions was demonstrated by FISH analysis of the T1 generation. Relative conclusions that can be drawn from molecular or FISH analysis are discussed along with future prospects of the engineering of large fragments for wheat transformation or genome editing."

QRT-PCR of 15 selected PKs were performed under drought treatment and with infection of Fusarium graminearum to validate the prediction of microarray. The protein kinase (PK) gene superfamily is one of the largest families in plants and participates in various plant processes, including growth, development, and stress response. To better understand wheat PKs, we conducted genome-wide identification, classification, evolutionary analysis and expression profiles of wheat and Ae. tauschii PKs. We identified 3269, 1213 and 1448 typical PK genes in T. aestivum, T. urartu and Ae. tauschii, respectively, and classified them into major groups and subfamilies. Domain distributions and gene structures were analyzed and visualized. Some conserved intron-exon structures within the conserved kinase domain were found in T. aestivum, T. urartu and Ae. tauschii, as well as the primitive land plants Selaginella moellendorffii and Physcomitrella patens, revealing the important roles and conserved evolutionary history of these PKs. We analyzed the collinearity events of T. aestivum PKs and identified PKs from polyploidizations and tandem duplication events. Global expression pattern analysis of T. aestivum PKs revealed tissue-specific and stress-specific expression profiles, hinting that some wheat PKs may regulate abiotic and biotic stress response signaling pathways.

"22044778","abstracttext","In the tetrapyrrole biosynthetic pathway of higher plants, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) is metabolized by ALA dehydratase (ALAD). Here, we isolated ALAD1 cDNA from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its diploid progenitors, and produced transgenic tobacco plants expressing the wheat ALAD1 gene. The ALAD1 genes were highly conserved among wheat relatives, and three homoeologous loci of wheat ALAD1 (TaALAD1) were equally transcribed in common wheat. A transient expression assay of a TaALAD1-GFP (green fluorescent protein) fusion protein suggested that TaALAD1 is localized in chloroplasts. Overexpression of TaALAD1 in transgenic tobacco resulted in a significant increase in ALAD activity in leaves. Moreover, the transgenic tobacco showed vigorous growth and increased survival rate on medium containing ALA at herbicidal concentrations. These results indicate that wheat ALAD1 has catalytic activity in metabolizing ALA in plastids, and that ectopic expression of TaALAD1 in transgenic plants increases their tolerance to ALA application at high concentrations."

Wheat flour is a common white powder encountered in such criminal investigations. We used DNA analysis to investigate wheat flour samples for identification and discrimination as trace evidence. Species identification of commercially available wheat flour was carried out by sequencing a partial region of the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large subunit gene (rbcL). Samples were discriminated using short tandem repeat (STR) analysis. The rbcL sequences of all wheat flour samples were identical and showed a high level of similarity to known wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) sequences. Furthermore, flours had characteristic patterns in STR analyses, with specific cultivars showing distinctive patterns. These results suggested that the identification of wheat flour species is possible using rbcL sequencing, and that STR analysis is useful for discriminating between samples."
"26468515","articletitle","Effectiveness of Genes for Hessian Fly (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) Resistance in the Southeastern United States."
"26468515","abstracttext","The Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), is the most important insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. subsp. aestivum) in the southeastern United States, and the deployment of genetically resistant wheat is the most effective control. However, the use of resistant wheat results in the selection of pest genotypes that can overcome formerly resistant wheat. We have evaluated the effectiveness of 16 resistance genes for protection of wheat from Hessian fly infestation in the southeastern United States. Results documented that while 10 of the genes evaluated could provide protection of wheat, the most highly effective genes were H12, H18, H24, H25, H26, and H33. However, H12 and H18 have been reported to be only partially effective in field evaluations, and H24, H25, and H26 may be associated with undesirable effects on agronomic traits when introgressed into elite wheat lines. Thus, the most promising new gene for Hessian fly resistance appears to be H33. These results indicate that identified highly effective resistance in wheat to the Hessian fly is a limited resource and emphasize the need to identify novel sources of resistance. Also, we recommend that the deployment of resistance in gene pyramids and the development of novel strategies for engineered resistance be considered."

"31414379","abstracttext","Recurrent selection and intercrossing between best of the best parents in each generation of breeding cycle resulted in a narrower genetic diversity in elite wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm. Therefore, we investigated diverse source of 143 synthetic and bread wheat accessions for identifying potentially rich genetic resources for improving the genetic diversity in wheat. This study identified 47,526 genotyping-by-sequencing-derived SNP markers that were nearly evenly distributed across three genomes of wheat. The population structure analysis identified three distinct clusters (Japan synthetics, CIMMYT synthetics, and bread wheat) of wheat genotypes on the basis of type and geographical origin of wheat accessions. Population differentiation using analysis of molecular variance indicated 21% of the total genetic variance among subgroups and the remainder within subgroups. This study also identified that the Japan synthetic group was the most divergent group compared with other subgroups. The genetic diversity comparisons between synthetic and bread wheat lines showed that the gene diversity of synthetic wheat was 33% higher than bread wheat accessions, indicating the potential use of these lines for broadening the genetic diversity of modern wheat cultivars. The results from this study will be helpful in further understanding genomic features of wheat and facilitate their use in wheat breeding programs."

"14645721","abstracttext","More than 50 leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes against the fungal pathogen Puccinia triticina have been identified in the wheat gene pool, and a large number of them have been extensively used in breeding. Of the 50 Lr genes, all are known only from their phenotype and/or map position except for Lr21, which was cloned recently. For many years, the problems of molecular work in the large (1.6 x 10(10) bp), highly repetitive (80%), and hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome have hampered map-based cloning. Here, we report the isolation of the Lr gene Lr10 from hexaploid wheat by using a combination of subgenome map-based cloning and haplotype studies in the genus Triticum. Lr10 is a single-copy gene on chromosome 1AS. It encodes a CC-NBS-LRR type of protein with an N-terminal domain, which is under diversifying selection. When overexpressed in transgenic wheat plants, Lr10 confers enhanced resistance to leaf rust. Lr10 has similarities to RPM1 in Arabidopsis thaliana and to resistance gene analogs in rice and barley, but is not closely related to other wheat Lr genes based on Southern analysis. We conclude that map-based cloning of genes of agronomic importance in hexaploid wheat is now feasible, opening perspectives for molecular bread wheat improvement trough transgenic strategies and diagnostic allele detection."
"31487050","articletitle","Wheat gene Sr60 encodes a protein with two putative kinase domains that confers resistance to stem rust."
"31487050","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is a devastating fungal disease threatening global wheat production. The present paper reports the identification of stem rust resistance gene Sr60, a race-specific gene from diploid wheat Triticum monococcum L. that encodes a protein with two putative kinase domains. This gene, designated as WHEAT TANDEM KINASE 2 (WTK2), confers intermediate levels of resistance to Pgt. WTK2 was identified by map-based cloning and validated by transformation of a c.10-kb genomic sequence including WTK2 into susceptible common wheat variety Fielder (Triticum aestivum L.). Transformation of Fielder with WTK2 was sufficient to confer Pgt resistance. Sr60 transcripts were transiently upregulated 1 d post-inoculation with Pgt, but not in mock-inoculated plants. The upregulation of Sr60 was associated with stable upregulation of several pathogenesis-related genes. The Sr60-resistant haplotype found in T. monococcum was not found in polyploid wheat, suggesting an opportunity to introduce a novel resistance gene. Sr60 was successfully introgressed into hexaploid wheat, and we developed a diagnostic molecular marker to accelerate its deployment and pyramiding with other resistance genes. The cloned Sr60 also can be a useful component of transgenic cassettes including other resistance genes with complementary resistance profiles."

"33295988","abstracttext","Yield losses caused by pests, including aphids, can be substantial in cereals. Breeding for resistance against aphids is therefore desirable for enhancing the economic and environmental sustainability of cereal production. The aim of our study was to reveal the degree of antibiosis against Metopolophium dirhodum (Walker) (Homoptera: Aphididae), in four cultivars of spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L. ('Alicia', 'Odeta', 'Libertina', 'Astrid'), and two cultivars of emmer, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum (Schrank ex Schübler) Thell. ('Rudico', 'Tapiruz') (both Poales: Poaceae) under controlled laboratory conditions. Using age-stage, two-sex life table, we quantified responses of M. dirhodum to each cultivar and to project population growth. The spring wheat and emmer cultivars varied in their suitability to M. dirhodum. The cultivar most susceptible to M. dirhodum was the emmer cultivar 'Rudico'; the projected population size of M. dirhodum on this cultivar was one order of magnitude larger than those on other cultivars. The most resistant cultivar was the spring wheat cultivar 'Libertina'. Since emmer is commonly used as a gene source for breeding T. aestivum, we advocate that care be taken to avoid the transmission of genes responsible for suitability to aphids from emmer to T. aestivum."

To identify important for resistance amino acid sites, the comparison of the founded homologues with the Sr33 and Sr35 protein sequences was performed. It was found that the sequences S5DMA6 and E9P785 are the closest homologues of RGA1e protein – a product of the Sr33 gene, and the sequences M7YFA9 (CNL-C) and F2E9R2 are the homologues of CNL9 – a product of the gene Sr35.

"16936781","abstracttext","The physical length of the rye segment of a 4BS.4BL-5RL translocation derived from the Cornell Wheat Selection 82a1-2-4-7 in a Triticum aestivum 'Chinese Spring' background was measured using genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and found to be 16% of the long arm. The size of this translocation was similar to previously published GISH measurements of another 4BS.4BL-5RL translocation in a Triticum aestivum 'Viking' wheat background. Molecular maps of both 4BS.4BL-5RL translocations for 2 different wheat backgrounds were developed using RFLP analysis. The locations of the translocation breakpoints of the 2 4BS.4BL-5RL translocations were similar even though they arose in different populations. This suggests a unique property of the region at or near the translocation breakpoint that could be associated with their similarity and spontaneous formation. These segments of rye chromosome 5 also contain a gene for copper efficiency that improves the wheat's ability to cope with low-copper soils. Genetic markers in these maps can also be used to screen for copper efficiency in bread wheat lines derived from the Cornell Wheat Selection 82a1 2-4-7."

"16668059","abstracttext","Hydrated dormant cereal seeds do not germinate even when environmental conditions are favorable for germination. By using cDNA cloning and differential screening, we have identified mRNAs from five gene families that are abundant in the embryos of imbibed, but developmentally arrested wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seeds. Gene transcript levels of these mRNAs are maintained and even increase in embryos of imbibed dormant seeds for as long as the seeds remain dormant. In contrast, transcript levels decline in nondormant seeds after imbibition and disappear as germination occurs. All the identified genes are ABA responsive. Based on these data we conclude that wheat seeds in the hydrated dormant state exhibit prolonged expression of ABA-responsive genes."

"9669335","abstracttext","A gene coding for a protein that shows homologies to prokaryotic ribosomal protein S2 is present in the mitochondrial (mt) genome of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The wheat gene is transcribed as a single mRNA which is edited by C-to-U conversions at seven positions, all resulting in alteration of the encoded amino acid. Homologous gene sequences are also present in the mt genomes of rice and maize, but we failed to identify the corresponding sequences in the mtDNA of all dicotyledonous species tested; in these species the mitochondrial RPS2 is probably encoded in the nucleus. The protein sequence deduced from the wheat rps2 gene sequence has a long C-terminal extension when compared to other prokaryotic RPS2 sequences. This extension presents no similarity with any known sequence and is not conserved in the maize or rice mitochondrial rps2 gene. Most probably, after translation, this peptide extension is processed by a specific peptidase to give rise to the mature wheat mitochondrial RPS2."

"25035500","abstracttext","An ordered draft sequence of the 17-gigabase hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome has been produced by sequencing isolated chromosome arms. We have annotated 124,201 gene loci distributed nearly evenly across the homeologous chromosomes and subgenomes. Comparative gene analysis of wheat subgenomes and extant diploid and tetraploid wheat relatives showed that high sequence similarity and structural conservation are retained, with limited gene loss, after polyploidization. However, across the genomes there was evidence of dynamic gene gain, loss, and duplication since the divergence of the wheat lineages. A high degree of transcriptional autonomy and no global dominance was found for the subgenomes. These insights into the genome biology of a polyploid crop provide a springboard for faster gene isolation, rapid genetic marker development, and precise breeding to meet the needs of increasing food demand worldwide."

"10659795","abstracttext","The efficiency of homeologous recombination is influenced by mismatch repair genes in bacteria, yeast, and mammals. To elucidate a possible role of these genes in homeologous pairing and cross-compatibility in plants, gene probes of wheat (Triticum aestivum) specific for the mismatch repair gene homologues MSH2, MSH3, and MSH6 were used to map them to their genomic positions in rye (Secale cereale). Whereas MSH2 was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1R, MSH3 was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2R and MSH6 to the long arm of chromosome 5R. Southern blots with nullisomic-tetrasomic (NT) lines of wheat indicated the presence of the sequences on the respective homeologous group of wheat chromosomes. Additionally, an MSH6-specific homologue could also be detected on homoeologous group 3 of wheat. However, in the well-known, highly homoeologous pairing wheat mutant ph1b the MSH6-specific sequence is not within the deleted part of chromosome 5BL, indicating that the pairing phenotype is not due to a loss of one of the mismatch repair genes tested."

Compared with sequences from a whole genome shotgun library from Aegilops tauschii (the D genome donor of bread wheat), the CF libraries exhibited 13.7-fold enrichment in genes, 5.8-fold enrichment in unknown low-copy sequences, and a 3-fold reduction in repetitive DNA. CF is twice as efficient as methylation filtration at enriching wheat genes. This research suggests that, with improvements, CF will be a highly useful tool in sequencing the gene space of wheat."

"22982315","abstracttext","The full-length cDNA (882bp) and DNA (1742bp) sequences encoding a basic transcription factor 3, designated as TaBTF3, were first isolated from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Subcellular localization studies revealed that the TaBTF3 protein was mainly located in the cytoplasm and nucleus. In TaBTF3-silenced transgenic wheat seedlings obtained using the Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) method, the chlorophyll pigment content was markedly reduced. However, the malonaldehyde (MDA) and H(2)O(2) contents were enhanced, and the structure of the wheat mesophyll cell was seriously damaged. Furthermore, transcripts of the chloroplast- and mitochondrial-encoded genes were significantly reduced in TaBTF3-silenced transgenic wheat plants. These results suggest that the TaBTF3 gene might function in the development of the wheat chloroplast, mitochondria and mesophyll cell. This paper is the first report to describe the involvement of TaBTF3 in maintaining the normal plant mesophyll cell structure."

"19488678","abstracttext","Homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (pistillody) has been reported in cytoplasmic substitution (alloplasmic) lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that have the cytoplasm of a related wild species, Aegilops crassa. An ectopic ovule differentiates in the pistil-like stamen in the alloplasmic wheat. The SEEDSTICK (STK)-like class D MADS-box gene, wheat STK (WSTK), was expressed in the primordia of ectopic ovules in the pistil-like stamens as well as in the true pistil, suggesting that ectopic ovule formation results from WSTK expression in the pistil-like stamens of alloplasmic wheat. The ectopic ovule is abnormal as it fails to form complete integuments. Based on the expression pattern of WSTK and B(sister) MADS-box gene, WBsis (wheat B ( sister )), we conclude that WSTK plays a role in determination of ovule identity in the pistil-like stamen, but complete ovule development fails due to aberrant expression of WBsis."

"24185888","abstracttext","Diploid-like chromosome pairing in polyploid wheat is controlled by several Ph (pairing homoeologous) genes with major and minor effects. Homoeologous pairing occurs in either the absence of these genes or their inhibition by genes from other species (Ph (I) genes). We transferred Ph (I) genes from Triticum speltoides (syn Aegilops speltoides) to T. aestivum, and on the basis of further analysis it appears that two duplicate and independent Ph (I) genes were transferred. Since Ph (I) genes are epistatic to the Ph genes of wheat, homoeologous pairing between the wheat and alien chromosomes occurs in the F1 hybrids. Using the Ph (I) gene stock, we could demonstrate homoeologous pairing between the wheat and Haynaldia villosa chromosomes. Since homoeologous pairing occurs in F1 hybrids and no cytogenetic manipulation is needed, the Ph (I) gene stock may be a versatile tool for effecting rapid and efficient alien genetic transfers to wheat."

A phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase kinase-related kinase gene, TaPEPKR2 , was identified from our previous heat stress-responsive transcriptome analysis of heat susceptible and tolerant wheat cultivars. Based on the wheat cultivar Chinese Spring genome sequence, TaPEPKR2 was mapped to chromosome 5B. Expression analysis revealed that TaPEPKR2 was induced by heat and polyethylene glycol treatment. To analyze the function of TaPEPKR2 in wheat, we transformed it into the wheat cultivar Liaochun10, and observed that the transgenic lines exhibited enhanced heat and dehydration stress tolerance. To examine whether TaPEPKR2 exhibits the same function in dicotyledonous plants, we transformed it into Arabidopsis , and found that its overexpression functionally enhanced tolerance to heat and dehydration stresses. Our results imply that TaPEPKR2 plays an important role in both heat and dehydration stress tolerance, and could be utilized as a candidate gene in transgenic breeding."

We describe a novel approach combining wheat cytogenetic resources (chromosome substitution 'nullisomic-tetrasomic' lines) with next generation deep sequencing of gene transcripts (RNA-Seq), to directly and accurately identify homoeologue-specific single nucleotide variants and quantify the relative contribution of individual homoeoloci to gene expression."

In our work, we primarily focused on the variations in physiochemical properties, conserved domains, secondary structure, gene ontology and evolutionary relationships among 40 LEA proteins of Triticum aestivum (common wheat). Wheat LEA protein belongs to first 6 classes out of the 13 classes present in LEApdB, the comprehensive database for LEA proteins. Proteins belonging to each LEApdB class have structures and functions distinguished from other classes. The study found three different conserved LEA domains in Triticum aestivum. One important domain was dehydrin, present in wheat proteins of classes 1, 2 and 4, though varied in sequence level, have similar biological processes. The study also found sequence level and phylogenetic similarity between dehydrin domains of class 1 and 4, but distinct from that of LEApdB class 2. This study also demonstrated functional diversity in two class 6 proteins occurred due to many destabilizing mutations in the LEA4 domain that caused alteration of ligand binding and conformational shift from 3 10 -helix → turn within the domain. The LEA4 domains of these proteins also showed functional similarity and evolutionary relatedness with three other proteins of genus Aegilops, denoting that these proteins in Triticum aestivum were derived from its ancestor Aegilops. The study also assigned LEApdB class 4 to an unclassified LEA protein 'WZY2-1' based on amino acid composition, conserved domain, motif architecture and phylogenetic relatedness with class 4 proteins.

This cDNA codes for a protein of 295 amino acids (33,414 daltons) including a 20-amino acid signal peptide as deduced from the DNA sequence. Northern analysis showed that this cDNA hybridizes to a family of related sequences ranging in length from 1,200 to 1,000 nucleotides. This gene is similar but not identical to previously published LMW glutenin gene sequences. The most striking characteristic of all cloned LMW glutenin genes is the conservation of eight cysteine residues, which could be involved in potential secondary or tertiary structure, disulfide bond interactions.

"33305445","abstracttext","The synthesis of seed storage protein (SSP) is mainly regulated at the transcriptional level. However, few transcriptional regulators of SSP synthesis have been characterized in common wheat (Triticum aestivum) owing to the complex genome. As the A genome donor of common wheat, Triticum urartu could be an elite model in wheat research considering its simple genome. Here, a novel NAC family transcription factor TuSPR from T. urartu was found preferentially expressed in developing endosperm during grain-filling stages. In common wheat transgenically overexpressing TuSPR, the content of total SSPs was reduced by c. 15.97% attributed to the transcription declines of SSP genes. Both in vitro and in vivo assays showed that TuSPR bound to the cis-element 5'-CANNTG-3' distributed in SSP gene promoters and suppressed the transcription. The homolog in common wheat TaSPR shared a conserved function with TuSPR on SSP synthesis suppression. The knock-down of TaSPR in common wheat resulted in 7.07%-20.34% increases in the total SSPs. Both TuSPR and TaSPR could be superior targets in genetic engineering to manipulate SSP content in wheat, and this work undoubtedly expands our knowledge of SSP gene regulation."

A comprehensive genome-wide analysis of transcriptional changes using the Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array was conducted. Prevalence of gene expression additivity was observed where expression does not deviate from the average of the parents for 99.3% of 34,820 expressed transcripts. Moreover, nearly similar expression was observed (for 99.5% of genes) when comparing these synthetic and natural wheat allohexaploids. Such near-complete additivity has never been reported for other allopolyploids and, more interestingly, for other synthetic wheat allohexaploids that differ from the ones studied here by having the natural tetraploid Triticum turgidum as the AB genome progenitor.

Six of the sequences were correctly positioned on the map including four that demonstrated a high level of colinearity with their orthologous rice genomic region.

The result of energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) showed that adsorption of CSNPs on the surface of wheat seeds was higher than that of CS. CSNPs had growth promoting effect at a lower concentration (5 μg/mL) compared with CS (50 μg/mL). In addition, the application of 5 μg/mL CSNPs induced the auxin-related gene expression, accelerated indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) biosynthesis and transport, and reduced IAA oxidase activity resulting in the increase of IAA concentration in wheat shoots and roots. The results suggest that CSNPs have positive effect on seed germination and seedling growth of wheat at a lower concentration than CS due to higher adsorption on the surface of wheat seeds."

TaLTP5 expression was induced after C. sativus infection. The TaLTP5 expression vector, pA25-TaLTP5, was constructed and bombarded into Chinese wheat variety Yangmai 18. Six TaLTP5 transgenic wheat lines were established and characterized. PCR and Southern blot analyses indicated that the introduced TaLTP5 gene was integrated into the genomes of six transgenic wheat lines by distinct patterns, and heritable. RT-PCR and real-time quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the TaLTP5 gene was over-expressed in the transgenic wheat lines compared to segregants lacking the transgene and wild-type wheat plants. Following challenge with C. sativus or F. graminearum, all six transgenic lines overexpressing TaLTP5 exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to both common root rot and Fusarium head blight compared to the untransformed wheat Yangmai 18."

"19194691","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a very destructive wheat (Triticum aestivum) disease. Resistance was transferred from Elytrigia intermedium to common wheat by crossing and backcrossing, and line GRY19, that was subsequently selected, possessed a single dominant gene for seedling resistance. Five polymorphic microsatellite markers, Xgwm297, Xwmc335, Xwmc364, Xwmc426 and Xwmc476, on chromosome arm 7BS, were mapped relative to the powdery mildew resistance locus in an F(2) population of Mianyang 11/GRY19. The loci order Xwmc426-Xwmc335-Pm40-Xgwm297-Xwmc364-Xwmc476, with 5.9, 0.2, 0.7, 1.2 and 2.9 cM genetic distances, was consistent with published maps. The resistance gene transferred from Elytrigia intermedium into wheat line GRY19 was novel, and was designated Pm40. The close flanking markers will enable marker assisted transfer of this gene into wheat breeding populations."

"19132076","abstracttext","A male sterile wheat mutant, Triticum aestivum L. 'Taigu', was found in a wheat field in China in 1972. The male sterility was controlled by a single dominant gene that was referred to as Ms2. Recently, this gene was found to be linked to a dwarfing gene through crossing Taigu with the short wheat T. aestivum 'Ai-Bian 1' carrying the dwarfing gene Rht-D1c. The objective of this study was to develop molecular markers linked to the male sterility Ms2 gene in common wheat. One hundred and twenty-two near-isogenic lines were developed through backcrossing and sib intercrossing and used as the mapping population for the development of molecular markers. Bulked segregant analysis was used to screen 48 pairs of SSR primers, and a marker, MS2-WMC617, was identified closely linked to the male sterile Ms2 gene that mapped at the distal position of chromosome arm 4DS. The use of the molecular marker MS2-WMC617 can facilitate recurrent selection in a wheat breeding program based on marker-assisted selection."

"23525634","abstracttext","The wild diploid wheat (Triticum urartu Thum. ex Gandil.) is a potential gene source for wheat breeding, as this species has been identified as the A-genome donor in polyploid wheats. One important wheat breeding trait is bread-making quality, which is associated in bread wheat (T. aestivum ssp. aestivum L. em. Thell.) with the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. In T. urartu, these proteins are encoded by the Glu-A1x and Glu-A1Ay genes at the Glu-A (u) 1 locus. The Glu-A1x genes of 12 Glu-A (u) 1 allelic variants previously detected in this species were analysed using PCR amplification and sequencing. Data showed wide diversity for the Glu-A1x alleles in T. urartu, which also showed clear differences to the bread wheat alleles. This variation could enlarge the high-quality genetic pool of modern wheat and be used to diversify the bread-making quality in durum (T. turgidum ssp. durum Desf. em. Husn.) and common wheat."

"24141639","abstracttext_key message","Using microarray analysis, we identified regulatory and signaling-related genes with differential expression in three genotypes with varying degrees of salt tolerance, Triticum aestivum , the amphiploid, and the wheat substitution line DS3E(3A). Lophopyrum elongatum is among one of the most salt-tolerant members of the Triticeae; important genetic stocks developed from crosses between wheat and L. elongatum provide a unique opportunity to compare gene expression in response to salt stress between these highly related species. The octaploid amphiploid contains the entire genome of T. aestivum and L. elongatum, and the disomic substitution line DS3E(3A) has chromosome 3A of wheat replaced by chromosome 3E of L. elongatum. In this study, microarray analysis was used to characterize gene expression profiles in the roots of three genotypes, Triticum aestivum, the octaploid amphiploid, and the wheat DS3E(3A) substitution line, in response to salt stress. We first examined changes in gene expression in wheat over a time course of 3 days of salt stress, and then compared changes in gene expression in wheat, the T. aestivum × L. elongatum amphiploid, and in the DS3E(3A) substitution line after 3 days of salt stress. In the time course experiment, 237 genes had 1.5 fold or greater change at least one out of three time points assayed in the experiment. The comparison between the three genotypes revealed 304 genes with significant differences in changes of expression between the genotypes. Forty-two of these genes had at least a twofold change in expression in response to salt treatment; 18 of these genes have signaling or regulatory function. Genes with significant differences in induction or repression between genotypes included transcription factors, protein kinases, ubiquitin ligases and genes related to phospholipid signaling."

According to RT-PCR results, correctly spliced transcripts were more highly expressed in some haplotypes than in others, and their expression was highly associated with their distinct responsiveness to abscisic acid (ABA) exposure.

"21357768","abstracttext","Two major genes for Na(+) exclusion in durum wheat, Nax1 and Nax2, that were previously identified as the Na(+) transporters TmHKT1;4-A2 and TmHKT1;5-A, were transferred into bread wheat in order to increase its capacity to restrict the accumulation of Na(+) in leaves. The genes were crossed from tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) into hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) by interspecific crossing and marker-assisted selection for hexaploid plants containing one or both genes. Nax1 decreased the leaf blade Na(+) concentration by 50%, Nax2 decreased it by 30%, and both genes together decreased it by 60%. The signature phenotype of Nax1, the retention of Na(+) in leaf sheaths resulting in a high Na(+) sheath:blade ratio, was found in the Nax1 lines. This conferred an extra advantage under a combination of waterlogged and saline conditions. The effect of Nax2 on lowering the Na(+) concentration in bread wheat was surprising as this gene is very similar to the TaHKT1;5-D Na(+) transporter already present in bread wheat, putatively at the Kna1 locus. The results indicate that both Nax genes have the potential to improve the salt tolerance of bread wheat."

However, the nucleus of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum (2n = 4x = 28, AABB)) is incompatible with the T. longissimum cytoplasm, producing non-viable progeny. This incompatibility is alleviated by scs(ae), a species cytoplasm-specific (scs) gene, on the long arm of chromosome 1D (1DL) of common wheat. The hemizygous (lo) durum scs(ae) line is male sterile and is maintained by crossing to normal durum wheat. After pollination, the seeds produced are either plump and viable (with scs(ae)) or shriveled and inviable (without scsae). Thus, the chromosome with scs(ae) is inherited as a whole without recombination. The objectives of this study were to characterize the chromosome carrying scs(ae) and to determine the process through which this gene was introgressed into the (lo) durum background. Molecular marker analysis with 27 probes and primers mapped to homoeologous group 1 and genomic in situ hybridization using differentially labeled total genomic DNA of durum wheat and Aegilops tauschii suggest the presence of a 1AL segment in place of the distal region of 1DL. Owing to the absence of any detectable duplications or deletions, homoeologous recombination is the most likely mechanism by which this introgression occurred."

The linear order of molecular markers along the chromosomes is almost identical in the A- B- and D-genome of wheat. In addition, there is colinearity between the physical and genetic maps of chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D from T. aestivum, indicating gene synteny among the Triticeae. However, comparison of the physical map of chromosome 7D from T. aestivum with the genetic map from Triticum tauschii some markers have been shown to be physically allocated with distortion in more distal chromosome regions. The integration of genetic and physical maps could assist in estimating the frequency and distribution of recombination in defined regions along the chromosome. Physical distance did not correlate with genetic distance. A dense map facilitates the detection of multiple rearrangements. We present the first evidence for an interstitial inversion either on chromosome arm 7AS or 7DS of Chinese Spring. Molecularly tagged chromosome regions (MTCRs) provide landmarks for long-range mapping of DNA fragments."

Seventeen different glutenin subunit patterns were observed for 14 alleles in Japanese varieties. A catalog of alleles for the complex gene loci, Glu-A1, Glu-B1, and Glu-D1, that code for HMW subunits of glutenin in hexaploid wheat was compiled. Japanese varieties showed some special allelic variation in glutenin HMW subunits that was different from those in hexaploid wheats of other countries."

Most of the selected cosmids contained single- or low-copy sequences, making them potentially useful in mapping studies. The repeats were used in deletion mapping to deduce gene order of three genes located on the Th. elongatum translocation arm. In situ hybridization studies suggested that this newly identified Th. elongatum repeat is well dispersed throughout the Thinopyrum genome but present at only one location in wheat.

"25747845","articletitle","Making the Bread: Insights from Newly Synthesized Allohexaploid Wheat."
"25747845","abstracttext","Bread wheat (or common wheat, Triticum aestivum) is an allohexaploid (AABBDD, 2n = 6x = 42) that arose by hybridization between a cultivated tetraploid wheat T. turgidum (AABB, 2n = 4x = 28) and the wild goatgrass Aegilops tauschii (DD, 2n = 2x = 14). Polyploidization provided niches for rigorous genome modification at cytogenetic, genetic, and epigenetic levels, rendering a broader spread than its progenitors. This review summarizes the latest advances in understanding gene regulation mechanisms in newly synthesized allohexaploid wheat and possible correlation with polyploid growth vigor and adaptation. Cytogenetic studies reveal persistent association of whole-chromosome aneuploidy with nascent allopolyploids, in contrast to the genetic stability in common wheat. Transcriptome analysis of the euploid wheat shows that small RNAs are driving forces for homoeo-allele expression regulation via genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. The ensuing non-additively expressed genes and those with expression level dominance to the respective progenitor may play distinct functions in growth vigor and adaptation in nascent allohexaploid wheat. Further genetic diploidization of allohexaploid wheat is not random. Regional asymmetrical gene distribution, rather than subgenome dominance, is observed in both synthetic and natural allohexaploid wheats. The combinatorial effects of diverged genomes, subsequent selection of specific gene categories, and subgenome-specific traits are essential for the successful establishment of common wheat."

We identified 191 markers validated across all seven chromosomes of T. monococcum. Detected a T. monococcum introgression in leaf-rust-resistant lines.

Einkorn has excellent resistance to fungal diseases and gene transfer is relatively simple via standard breeding methods. To fulfill the growing demand by modern prebreeding programs for a cost-effective high-throughput procedure for accurately detecting introgressed chromosomes or chromosome segments from T. monococcum into wheat, we used the Axiom Wheat-Relative Genotyping Array and developed a set of A m genome-specific exome-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers suitable for rapid identification of T. monococcum chromatin in a wheat background. We identified 1247 polymorphic SNPs between T. monococcum and wheat. We identified 191 markers across all seven chromosomes of T. monococcum that are also present on an existing Triticum urartu Thum. ex Gandil. genetic map and potentially ordered them on the basis of the high macrocollinearity and conservation of marker order between T. monococcum and T. urartu. The marker set has been tested on leaf-rust-resistant BC 3 F 4 progenies of wheat-T. monococcum hybrids. Two markers (AX-94492165, AX-95073542) placed on the distal end of the chromosome arm 7AL detected a T. monococcum introgression into wheat. The SNP marker set thus proved highly effective in the identification of T. monococcum chromatin in a wheat background, offering a reliable method for screening and selecting wheat-T. monococcum introgression lines, a procedure that could significantly speed up prebreeding programs."

"7924620","abstracttext","Three new 18S.26S rRNA gene loci were identified in common wheat by sequential N-banding and in situ hybridization (ISH) analysis. Locus Nor-A7 is located at the terminal area of the long arm of 5A in both diploid and polyploid wheats. Locus Nor-B6 is located in N-band 1BL2.5 of the long arm of chromosome 1B in Triticum turgidum and Triticum aestivum. ISH sites, similar to Nor-B6, were also detected on the long arms of chromosomes 1G in Triticum timopheevii and 1S in Aegilops speltoides, but their locations on the chromosomes were different from that of Nor-B6, indicating possible chromosome rearrangements in 1GL and 1BL during evolution. The third new locus, Nor-D8, was only found on the short arm of chromosome 3D in the common wheat Wichita. The loss of rRNA gene locus Nor-A3 and gain of repetitive DNA sequence pSc119 on the terminal part of 5AS suggest a structural modification of 5AS. Comparative studies of the location of the 18S.26S rRNA gene loci in polyploid wheats and putative A and B (G) genome progenitor species support the idea that: (1) Triticum monococcum subsp. urartu is the donor of both the A and A(t) genome of polyploid wheats. (2) Ae. speltoides is closer to the B and G genome of polyploid wheats than Aegilops longissima and is the most probable progenitor of these two genomes."

In the first experiment, hph was activated by excision of the Ac element, which encodes transposase, in the two wheat cell lines. In the second experiment, the Ds element was excised by a stabilized Ac element, lacking inverted repeats of the Ac element and located on another plasmid, and therefore leading to activation of hph. After selection of bombarded cells by hygromycin B, many resistant calli were recovered in both wheat cell lines. The integration of hph and the Ac transposase gene was confirmed by PCR and genomic Southern analysis. The stable expression of hph and the transposase gene was also assessed by Northern blot and reverse transcriptase PCR analysis, respectively. Moreover, characteristic sequence alterations were found at Ac/Ds excision sites. These findings indicate that the maize Ac/Ds transposable elements are activated and excised by expression of the Ac transposase gene in both diploid and hexaploid wheat cells."

This is evidenced by FoMV-based silencing of phytoene desaturase (PDS) and magnesium chelatase in barley, of PDS and Cloroplastos alterados1 in foxtail millet and wheat, and of an additional gene IspH in foxtail millet. Silencing of these genes resulted in photobleached or chlorosis phenotypes in barley, wheat, and foxtail millet. Furthermore, our FoMV-based gene silencing is the first VIGS system reported for foxtail millet, an important C4 model plant.

In this chapter, we summarize the main features and challenges of wheat transformation and then describe detailed protocols for the production of transgenic wheat plants both by biolistic and Agrobacterium-mediated DNA-delivery. Although these methods are used mainly for bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), they can also be successfully applied, with slight modifications, to tetraploid durum wheat (T. turgidum L. var. durum). The appropriate size and developmental stage of explants (immature embryo-derived scutella), the conditions to produce embryogenic callus tissues, and the methods to regenerate transgenic plants under increasing selection pressure are provided in the protocol. To illustrate the application of herbicide selection system, we have chosen to describe the use of the plasmid pAHC25 for biolistic transformation, while for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation the binary vector pAL156 (incorporating both the bar gene and the uidA gene) has been chosen. Beside the step-by-step methodology for obtaining stably transformed and normal fertile plants, procedures for screening and testing transgenic wheat plants are also discussed."

"24086083","abstracttext","Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important cereals in the world. To improve wheat quality and productivity, the genomic sequence of wheat must be determined. The large genome size (∼17 Gb/1 C) and the hexaploid status of wheat have hampered the genome sequencing of wheat. However, flow sorting of individual chromosomes has allowed us to purify and separately shotgun-sequence a pair of telocentric chromosomes. Here, we describe a result from the survey sequencing of wheat chromosome 6B (914 Mb/1 C) using massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. From the 4.94 and 5.51 Gb shotgun sequence data from the two chromosome arms of 6BS and 6BL, 235 and 273 Mb sequences were assembled to cover ∼55.6 and 54.9% of the total genomic regions, respectively. Repetitive sequences composed 77 and 86% of the assembled sequences on 6BS and 6BL, respectively. Within the assembled sequences, we predicted a total of 4798 non-repetitive gene loci with the evidence of expression from the wheat transcriptome data. The numbers and chromosomal distribution patterns of the genes for tRNAs and microRNAs in wheat 6B were investigated, and the results suggested a significant involvement of DNA transposon diffusion in the evolution of these non-protein-coding RNA genes. A comparative analysis of the genomic sequences of wheat 6B and monocot plants clearly indicated the evolutionary conservation of gene contents."

"29695751","abstracttext","Plant caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) has been implicated in the lignin biosynthetic pathway through catalyzing the multi-step methylation reactions of hydroxylated monomeric lignin precursors. However, genetic evidence for its function in plant disease resistance is poor. Sharp eyespot, caused primarily by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis, is a destructive disease in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, a wheat COMT gene TaCOMT-3D, is identified to be in response to R. cerealis infection through microarray-based comparative transcriptomics. The TaCOMT-3D gene is localized in the long arm of the chromosome 3D. The transcriptional level of TaCOMT-3D is higher in sharp eyespot-resistant wheat lines than in susceptible wheat lines, and is significantly elevated after R. cerealis inoculation. After R. cerealis inoculation and disease scoring, TaCOMT-3D-silenced wheat plants exhibit greater susceptibility to sharp eyespot compared to unsilenced wheat plants, whereas overexpression of TaCOMT-3D enhances resistance of the transgenic wheat lines to sharp eyespot. Moreover, overexpression of TaCOMT-3D enhances the stem mechanical strength, and lignin (particular syringyl monolignol) accumulation in the transgenic wheat lines. These results suggest that TaCOMT-3D positively contributes to both wheat resistance against sharp eyespot and stem mechanical strength possibly through promoting lignin (especially syringyl monolignol) accumulation."

A dominant leaf rust resistance gene in the Chilean durum cv. Llareta INIA was mapped to chromosome arm 7BL through bulked segregant analysis using the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique, and by mapping three polymorphic markers in the common wheat (T. aestivum) International Triticeae Mapping Initiative population. Several simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, including Xgwm344-7B and Xgwm146-7B, were associated with the leaf rust resistance gene. Resistance response and chromosomal position indicated that this gene is likely to be Lr14a. The SSR markers Xgwm344-7B and Xgwm146-7B and one AFLP marker also differentiated common wheat cv. Thatcher from the near-isogenic line with Lr14a, as well as durum 'Altar C84' from durum wheat with Lr14a. This is the first report of the presence of Lr14a in durum wheat, although the gene originally was transferred from emmer wheat 'Yaroslav' to common wheat. Lr14a is also present in CIMMYT-derived durum 'Somateria' and effective against Mexican and other P. triticina races of durum origin. Lr14a should be deployed in combination with other effective leaf rust resistance genes to prolong its effectiveness in durum wheat."

"33050874","abstracttext_background","Threshability, rachis fragility and spike shape are critical traits for the domestication and evolution of wheat, determining the crop yield and efficiency of the harvest. Spelt factor gene Q controls a wide range of domestication-related traits in polyploid wheats, including those mentioned above. The main goal of the present study was to characterise the Q gene for uninvestigated accessions of wheats, including four endemics, and Aegilops accessions, and to analyze the species evolution based on differences in Q gene sequences."
"33050874","abstracttext_results","We have studied the spike morphology for 15 accessions of wheat species, including four endemics, namely Triticum macha, T. tibetanum, T. aestivum ssp. petropavlovskyi and T. spelta ssp. yunnanense, and 24 Aegilops accessions, which are donors of B and D genomes for polyploid wheat. The Q-5A, q-5D and q-5S genes were investigated, and a novel allele of the Q-5A gene was found in accessions of T. tibetanum (KU510 and KU515). This allele was similar to the Q allele of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring but had an insertion 161 bp in length within exon 5. This insertion led to a frameshift and premature stop codon formation. Thus, the T. tibetanum have spelt spikes, which is probably determined by the gene Tg, rather than Q. We determined the variability within the q-5D genes among hexaploid wheat and their D genome donor Aegilops tauschii. Moreover, we studied the accessions C21-5129, KU-2074, and K-1100 of Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata, which could be involved in the origin of hexaploid wheats."
"33050874","abstracttext_conclusions","The variability and phylogenetic relationships of the Q gene sequences studied allowed us to clarify the relationships between species of the genus Triticum and to predict the donor of the D genome among the Ae. tauschii accessions. Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata accessions C21-5129, KU-2074 and K-1100 are the most interesting among the analysed accessions, since their partial sequence of q-5D is identical to the q-5D of T. aestivum cv. Chinese Spring. This result indicates that the donor is Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata but not Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii. Our analysis allowed us to clarify the phylogenetic relationships in the genus Triticum."

"18469918","abstracttext","Several sources of high-level resistance to tan spot caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis have been identified in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). This study was conducted to determine the number and chromosome location of a gene(s) in the cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) that confers resistance to a tan necrosis inducing isolate (nec+chl&minus;) of P. tritici-repentis, 86-124, and insensitivity to Ptr necrosis toxin. Reciprocal crosses were made between CS (resistant-insensitive) and 'Kenya Farmer' (KF) (susceptible-sensitive). Analysis of the CS/KF F1and F2 populations and F2-derived F3 families identified a single nuclear recessive gene governing resistance to isolate 86-124 and Ptr necrosis toxin. Evaluation of the CS(KF) substitution series, F2 monosomic analysis, and screening of a series of 19 CS compensating nullitetrasomic and two ditelosomic lines (2AS and 5BL) indicated that the resistance gene was located on chromosome arm 5BL. No linkage exists between Lr18 and the tan necrosis resistance gene on chromosome arm 5BL. It is proposed that the gene for resistance to the tan necrosis inducing isolate 86-124 (nec+chl&minus;) of P. tritici-repentis and Ptr necrosis toxin be named tsn1. Key words : wheat, Triticum aestivum L., tan spot resistance, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs., chromosome location, Ptr necrosis toxin."

"16308702","abstracttext","Numerous sequence variants of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) genes have been found. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to measure the expression levels of three MnSOD genes distinguished by a variable amino acid, and three genes distinguished by sequence variation in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR), in wheat plants grown at 20 degrees C and cold-acclimated for 1-4 weeks at 2 degrees C. The amino acid variants did not differ significantly in expression levels, however, differential expression of genes differing in the 3' UTR was observed. Diploid wheat-related species also carried sequence variants of MnSOD, with differing levels of expression, suggesting diversification of the MnSOD gene family occurred prior to the polyploidization events of hexaploid wheat."

"18818899","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the major diseases of common wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm23, identified in the common wheat Line 81-7241 and originally assigned to wheat chromosome 5A, was relocated on chromosome 2AL with the aid of molecular markers. Mapping of microsatellite markers in two wheat crosses segregating for Pm23 and Pm4b, respectively, in combination with the reported mapping of Pm4a, indicated that the three genes were all linked to the marker Xgwm356 with a distance of 3-5 cM. Allelism between Pm4b and Pm23 was then confirmed, when the progenies of a cross between VPM1 (Pm4b) and Line 81-7241, were shown to be all resistant to a B. graminis isolate avirulent to the both parents. Pm23 is therefore a new allele of the Pm4 locus, and was redesignated as Pm4c."

"24240338","abstracttext","Further data on the inheritance of seed peroxidases of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.) have been obtained from the genetic analysis of several progenies of both species. Additional data on the inheritance and the chromosomal location and linkage have been obtained for peroxidases of wheat embryo and rye endosperm. The general presence of null alleles in peroxidase loci has been confirmed in both species. In addition to simple monogenic inheritance, epistatic segregations have been observed in both species. These epistatic segregations again suggest the presence of ""regulatory"" genes controlling the expression of individual peroxidases in both species and also the existence of several duplicate homoeologous genes in wheat. Known linkage relationships have been confirmed and new ones are indicated. Loci for embryo wheat peroxidases seem to be in chromosomes of the homoeology group 3. The rye endosperm ones should be in chromosome 7R, although it is hypothesized that a duplication of gene EPer1 is located in chromosomes 4R and 7R."

"25035498","abstracttext","Allohexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) provides approximately 20% of calories consumed by humans. Lack of genome sequence for the three homeologous and highly similar bread wheat genomes (A, B, and D) has impeded expression analysis of the grain transcriptome. We used previously unknown genome information to analyze the cell type-specific expression of homeologous genes in the developing wheat grain and identified distinct co-expression clusters reflecting the spatiotemporal progression during endosperm development. We observed no global but cell type- and stage-dependent genome dominance, organization of the wheat genome into transcriptionally active chromosomal regions, and asymmetric expression in gene families related to baking quality. Our findings give insight into the transcriptional dynamics and genome interplay among individual grain cell types in a polyploid cereal genome."

"17163903","abstracttext","A full-length genomic clone containing the gene encoding the large subunit of the ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase (Agp2), was isolated from a genomic library prepared from etiolated shoots of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv, Chinese Spring). The coding region of this gene is identical to one of the cDNA clones previously isolated from a developing wheat grain cDNA library and is therefore an actively transcribed gene. The sequence represented by the cDNA spans 4.8 kb of the genomic clone and contains 15 introns. 2852 bp of DNA flanking the transcription start site of the gene was cloned upstream of the GUS (beta-glucuronidase) reporter gene. This Agp2::GUS construct and promoter deletions were used to study the pattern of reporter gene expression in both transgenic tobacco and wheat plants. Histochemical analysis of GUS expression in transgenic tobacco demonstrated that the reporter gene was expressed in guard cells of leaves and throughout the seed. In transgenic wheat, reporter gene expression was confined to the endosperm and aleurone with no expression in leaves. The cloned Agp2 gene was located to chromosome 1B by gene-specific PCR with nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. Northern analysis demonstrated that the Agp2 genes are differentially expressed in leaves and developing endosperm; while all three classes of Agp2 genes are transcribed in developing wheat grain endosperm, only one is transcribed in leaves. The differences between the Agp2 genes are discussed in relation to the evolution of hexaploid wheat."

"25007249","abstracttext","We present an efficient method for the production of transgenic salt tolerant hexaploid wheat plants expressing the Arabidopsis AtNHX1 gene. Wheat mature zygotic embryos were isolated from two hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars (namely: Gemmeiza 9 and Gemmeiza 10) and were transformed with the A. tumefaciens LBA4404 harboring the pBI-121 vector containing the AtNHX1 gene. Transgenic wheat lines that express the gus intron was obtained and used as control. The results confirmed that npt-II gene could be transmitted and expressed in the T2 following 3:1 Mendelian segregation while the control plant couldn't. The data indicate that, the AtNHX1 gene was integrated in a stable manner into the wheat genome and the corresponding transcripts were expressed. The transformation efficiency was 5.7 and 7.5% for cultivars Gemmeiza 10 and Gemmeiza 9, respectively. A greenhouse experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of AtNHX1 gene in wheat salt tolerance. The transgenic wheat lines could maintain high growth rate under salt stress condition (350 mM NaCl) while the control plant couldn't. The results confirmed that Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene AtNHX1 increased salt tolerance by increasing Na(+) accumulation and keeping K+/Na(+) balance. Thus, transgenic plants showed high tolerance to salt stress and can be considered as a new genetic resource in breeding programs."

"24561894","abstracttext","The effects of waterlogging (WL) and WL plus nitric oxide (WL+NO) were investigated in seedlings of one wheat cultivars (Triticum aestivum cv. Dogankent) and one wheat line (Triticum aestivum cv. Ducula-4). Under WL conditions, catalase activity was greater in Ducula-4 than in Dogankent. Glutathione reductase activity increased in Ducula-4 seedlings under WL+NO conditions, especially at 48 and 72 hours of treatment. Myb2 expression increased during the early hours of treatment in both wheat varieties exposed to WL, with 40-fold higher levels in Ducula-4, gradually decreasing to control levels. Under WL+NO treatment, Myb2 expression increased 44-fold at 12 hours and high levels of expression were still observed at 72 hours. When Ducula-4 seedlings were subjected to WL+NO treatment, PDPK expression increased approximately 15-fold at 3 hours and decreased to control levels at 72 hours. Under the same conditions, SST1 expression increased 3-fold at 3 and 12 hours and reached control levels during the subsequent hours. Among the genes studied, the highest level of expression was observed for Myb2. Moreover, gene expression was altered most by waterlogging in Ducula-4 seedlings."

"27182071","abstracttext","Root knot nematodes (RKN; Meloidogyne spp.) cause severe losses worldwide to a wide range of crops. Crop rotations with resistant hosts can be used to control losses, but the wide host range of RKN limits this option. In this study, we found that the wheat cultivar Lassik is resistant to several isolates of the RKN species M. incognita and M. javanica , including those that can reproduce on tomato with the resistance gene Mi-1 . Comparison of near-isogenic lines of wheat showed that the wheat resistance gene(s) is localized within a segment of the short arm of chromosome 2N from Aegilops ventricosa (Zhuk.) Chennav translocated into common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) chromosome arm 2AS and is associated with a highly significant decrease in RKN eggs in the roots. This RKN resistance gene has been assigned the name Rkn3 . While wheat itself is tolerant of RKN infection, a microplot experiment coupled with tomato bioassays showed less RKN root galling in the tomato samples grown in soil from the previous microplots including RKN resistant wheat varieties than in those including a susceptible wheat isogenic line. This result suggests that rotation with Rkn3 resistant wheat cultivars has the potential to be a valuable component of nematode management for crops that are highly susceptible to nematode damage and for which alternative strategies are limited."

"24040315","abstracttext","Heavy nitrogen (N) application to gain higher yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) resulted in increased production cost and environment pollution. How to diminish the N supply without losing yield and/or quality remains a challenge. To meet the challenge, we integrated and expressed a tobacco nitrate reductase gene (NR) in transgenic wheat. The 35S-NR gene was transferred into two winter cultivars, ""Nongda146"" and ""Jimai6358"", by Agrobacterium-mediation. Over-expression of the transgene remarkably enhanced T1 foliar NR activity and significantly augmented T2 seed protein content and 1000-grain weight in 63.8% and 68.1% of T1 offspring (total 67 individuals analyzed), respectively. Our results suggest that constitutive expression of foreign nitrate reductase gene(s) in wheat might improve nitrogen use efficiency and thus make it possible to increase seed protein content and weight without augmenting N supplying."

Monosomic analysis showed that the Lr gene in Agro 139 was incorporated into wheat chromosome 6D. C-banding analysis could not determine the C-banding pattern of A. intermedium in wheat -Agropyron lines Agro 58 and Agro 139. It is assumed that the transfers occurred from the euchromatin regions of the Agropyron chromosomes to the euchromatin regions of the wheat chromosomes. It is suggested that the Lr gene from Agro 139 be designated LrAg (i)-1 and the Lr gene from Agro 58 designated LrAg (i)-2."

"27581057","abstracttext","The COP9 (constitutive photomorphogenesis 9) signalosome (CSN) is a protein complex involved in the ubiquitin proteasome system and a common host target of diverse pathogens in Arabidopsis. The known derubylation function of the COP9 complex is carried out by subunit 5 encoded by AtCSN5A or AtCSN5B in Arabidopsis. A single CSN5-like gene (designated as TaCSN5) with three homeologues was identified on the long arms of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) group 2 chromosomes. In this study, we identified and characterized the function of TaCSN5 in response to infection by the leaf rust pathogen. Down-regulation of all three TaCSN5 homeologues or mutations in the homeologues on chromosomes 2A or 2D resulted in significantly enhanced resistance to leaf rust. Enhanced leaf rust resistance corresponded to a seven-fold increase in PR1 (pathogenesis-related gene 1) expression. Collectively, the data indicate that the wheat COP9 subunit 5-like gene acts as a negative regulator of wheat leaf rust resistance."

"31139551","abstracttext","The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor family is crucial for plant development and stress responses. In this study, we identified 159 bHLH-encoding genes in the wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) genome and determined their roles in biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the TabHLH genes were classified into 19 groups, which shared similar gene structures and conserved motifs. A comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed that bHLH genes were differentially expressed in diverse wheat tissues and were responsive to multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. A gene ontology analysis indicated that most bHLH proteins involved in DNA-binding activities and the gene expression regulation. Analyses of interaction networks suggested that TabHLHs mediate networks involved in multiple stress-signaling pathways. The findings of this study may help clarify the intricate transcriptional control of bHLH genes and identify putative stress-responsive genes relevant to the genetic improvement of wheat."

The data indicated that embryogenic calli were formed within 7 days in the presence of 2 mgl-1 2,4-D. Adventitious shoots emerged from the embryonic calli in the presence of 2 mgl-1 BA. Shoot regeneration frequency varied between wheat cultivars according to their genetic background differences. Regeneration frequency was higher in the cultivar Gemmiza 10 (95 %) compared with the other cultivars tested. Mature embryos derived callus of the cultivars Gemmiza 10 and Gemmiza 9 were co-cultivated with A. tumefaciens strain LBA4404 harboring a binary vector pBI-121 containing the neomycin phosphotransferase-II gene (npt-II). The resulted putative transgenic plantlets were able to grow on kanamycin containing medium. A successful integration of the transgene was confirmed by analyzing the T0 plantlets using Southern hybridization and PCR amplification. The gus gene expression can be detected only in the transgenic plants. The reported protocol is reproducible and can be used to regenerate transgenic wheat plants expressing the genes present in A. tumifaciens binary vectors."

Pericentric rearrangements in this genotype were systematically assessed by analyzing homoeoloci for a set of nonredundant genes from Brachypodium distachyon, Triticum urartu, and Aegilops tauschii in the CS chromosome shotgun sequence obtained from individual chromosome arms flow-sorted from CS aneuploid lines. Based on patterns of their homoeologous arm locations, 551 genes indicated the presence of pericentric inversions in at least 10 of the 21 chromosomes. Available data from deletion bin-mapped expressed sequence tags and genetic mapping in wheat indicated that all inversions had breakpoints in the low-recombinant gene-poor pericentromeric regions. The large number of putative intrachromosomal rearrangements suggests the presence of extensive structural differences among the three subgenomes, at least some of which likely occurred during the production of the aneuploid lines of this hexaploid wheat genotype. These differences could have significant implications in wheat genome research where comparative approaches are used such as in ordering and orientating sequence contigs and in gene cloning."

"31681381","abstracttext","The AP2 transcription factors play important roles in regulating plant growth and development. However, limited data are available on the contributions of AP2 transcription factors in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). In the present study, a total of 62 AP2 genes were identified in wheat from a genome-wide search against the latest wheat genome data. Phylogenetic and sequence alignment analyses divided the wheat AP2 genes into 3 clusters, euAP2, euANT, and basalANT. Chromosomal distribution, gene structure and duplication, and motif composition were subsequently investigated. The 62 TaAP2 genes were unevenly distributed on 21 chromosomes. Twenty-four homologous gene sets among A, B, and D sub-genomes were detected, which contributed to the expansion of the wheat AP2 gene family. The expression levels of TaAP2 genes were examined using the WheatExp database; most detected genes exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. The transcript levels of 9 randomly selected TaAP2 genes were validated through qPCR analyses. Overexpression of TaAP2-10-5D , the most likely homolog of Arabidopsis ANT gene, increased organ sizes in Arabidopsis . Our results extend our knowledge of the AP2 gene family in wheat, and contribute to further functional characterization of AP2s during wheat development with the ultimate goal of improving crop production."

"3186748","abstracttext","Structural alterations of the chloroplast genome tend to occur at ""hot spots"" on the physical map. To clarify the mechanism of mutation of chloroplast genome structure in higher plants, we determined the nucleotide sequence of the hot-spot region of chloroplast DNAs related to length mutations (deletions/insertions) in Triticum (wheat) and Aegilops. From a comparison of this region in wheat with the corresponding region of tobacco or liverwort, it is evident that one of the open reading frames in tobacco (ORF512) has been replaced in wheat by the rpl23 gene, which is a member of the ribosomal protein gene operon. In the deleted positions and in the original genome of Triticum and Aegilops, consensus sequences forming short direct repeats were found, indicating that these deletions were a result of intramolecular recombination mediated by these short direct-repeat sequences. By two independent recombination events in the Aegilops crassa type of chloroplast genome, which is shared by Triticum monococcum, Ae. bicornis, Ae. sharonensis, Ae. comosa, and Ae. mutica, the novel chloroplast DNA sequences of T. aestivum and Ae. squarrosa were generated. This finding indicates the existence of illegitimate recombination in the chloroplast genome and presents a mechanism for producing genetic diversity of that genome."

To quantify the amount of transcript accumulation in wheat, rye, triticale, and in the disomic and the ditelosomic rye addition lines to wheat, we used two independant methods, namely (1) Northern dot-blot hybridizations and (2) an exami-nation of the in-vitro translation products. Both the HSP18 and HSP70 transcripts were expressed at similar levels in Chinese Spring wheat, Imperial rye, and triticale. The HSP18 and HSP70 transcript levels of the disomic and the ditelosomic addition lines to wheat were compared to the transcript levels in wheat. With the exception of 5R, increased levels of HSP18 and/or HSP70 transcripts were expressed in all six of the remaining disomic addition lines. A neutral or suppressed level of HSP18 and HSP70 transcripts accumulated in addition lines 5R, 5RL, 5RS and 6RL. Wheat/rye genomic interactions influenced the level of heat-shock gene transcript accumulation in triticale. Rye chromosome 5R, and in particular both arms of rye chromosome 5R (5RL and 5RS), had a strong suppressive influence on the accumulation of wheat HSP18 and HSP70 transcripts. The genes controlling rye HSP expression appeared to be widely distributed throughout the rye genome."

"27775198","abstracttext","Yield and quality improvement of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a focus in efforts to meet new demands from population growth and changing human diets. As the complexity of the wheat genome is unravelled, determining how it is used to build the protein machinery of wheat plants is a key next step in explaining detailed aspects of wheat growth and development. The specific functions of wheat organs during vegetative development and the role of metabolism, protein degradation and remobilisation in driving grain production are the foundations of crop performance and have recently become accessible through studies of the wheat proteome. We present a large scale, publicly accessible proteome mapping of wheat consisting of 24 organ and developmental samples. Tissue specific sub-proteomes and ubiquitously expressed markers of the wheat proteome are identified, alongside hierarchical assessment of protein functional classes, their presence in different tissues and correlations between the abundance of functional classes of proteins. Gene-specific identifications and protein family relationships are accounted for in the organisation of the data and 202 new protein-coding transcripts identified by proteogenomic mapping.

"29616071","abstracttext","As an important relative of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L), Dasypyrum breviaristatum contains novel high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) encoded by Glu-1Vb genes. We identified new wheat- D. breviaristatum chromosome introgression lines including chromosomes 1V b and 1V b L.5V b L by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) combined with molecular markers. We found that chromosome changes occurred in the wheat- D. breviaristatum introgression lines and particularly induced the deletion of 5BS terminal repeats and formation of a new type of 5B-7B reciprocal translocation. The results imply that the D. breviaristatum chromosome 1V b may contain genes which induce chromosomal recombination in wheat background. Ten putative high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes from D. breviaristatum and wheat- D. breviaristatum introgression lines were isolated. The lengths of the HMW-GS genes in Dasypyrum were significantly shorter than typical HMW-GS of common wheat. A new y-type HMW-GS gene, named Glu-Vb1y , was characterized in wheat- D. breviaristatum 1V b introgression lines. The new wheat- D. breviaristatum germplasm displayed reduced plant height, increased tillers and superior grain protein and gluten contents, improved gluten performance index. The results showed considerable potential for utilization of D. breviaristatum chromosome 1V b segments in future wheat improvement."

"29780215","abstracttext","Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is a temperate cereal with an optimum temperature range of 15-22°C during the grain filling stage. Heat stress is one of the major environmental constraints for wheat production worldwide. Temperatures above 25°C during the grain filling stage significantly reduced wheat yield and quality. This reduction was reported due to the inactivation of the soluble starch synthase, a key heat-labile enzyme in starch transformation of wheat endosperm. To improve wheat productivity under heat stress, the rice soluble starch synthase I, under the control of either a constitutive promoter or an endosperm-specific promoter, was expressed in wheat and the transgenic lines were monitored for expression and the effects on yield-related traits. The results showed that the transgenic wheat events expressed rice soluble starch synthase I at a high level after four generations, and transgenic plants produced grains of greater weight during heat stress. Under heat stress conditions, the thousand kernel weight increased 21-34% in T 2 and T 3 transgenic plants compared to the non-transgenic control plants. In addition, the photosynthetic duration of transgenic wheat was longer than in non-transgenic controls. This study demonstrated that the engineering of a heat tolerant soluble starch synthase gene can be a potential strategy to improve wheat yield under heat stress conditions."

"31963767","abstracttext","Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is an important staple crop. Sharp eyespot and common root rot are destructive diseases of wheat. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are small peptides with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. In this study, we synthesized the DmAMP1W gene, encoding Dahlia merckii DmAMP1, and investigated the antifungal role of DmAMP1W in vitro and in transgenic wheat. Protein electrophoresis analysis and in vitro inhibition results demonstrated that the synthesized DmAMP1W correctly translated to the expected peptide DmAMP1W, and the purified peptide inhibited growths of the fungi Rhizoctonia cerealis and Bipolaris sorokiniana , the pathogenic causes of wheat sharp eyespot and common root rot. DmAMP1W was introduced into a wheat variety Zhoumai18 via Agrobacterium -mediated transformation. The molecular characteristics indicated that DmAMP1W could be heritable and expressed in five transgenic wheat lines in T 1 -T 2 generations. Average sharp eyespot infection types of these five DmAMP1W transgenic wheat lines in T 1 -T 2 generations decreased 0.69-1.54 and 0.40-0.82 compared with non-transformed Zhoumai18, respectively. Average common root rot infection types of these transgenic lines and non-transformed Zhoumai18 were 1.23-1.48 and 2.27, respectively. These results indicated that DmAMP1W-expressing transgenic wheat lines displayed enhanced-resistance to both sharp eyespot and common root rot. This study provides new broad-spectrum antifungal resources for wheat breeding."

Most bread wheat genes are present in the genome as triplicated homoeologous genes (homoeologs) derived from the ancestral species. Here, we report that both genetic and epigenetic alterations have occurred in the homoeologs of a wheat class E MADS box gene. Two class E genes are identified in wheat, wheat SEPALLATA (WSEP) and wheat LEAFY HULL STERILE1 (WLHS1), which are homologs of Os MADS45 and Os MADS1 in rice (Oryza sativa), respectively. The three wheat homoeologs of WSEP showed similar genomic structures and expression profiles. By contrast, the three homoeologs of WLHS1 showed genetic and epigenetic alterations. The A genome WLHS1 homoeolog (WLHS1-A) had a structural alteration that contained a large novel sequence in place of the K domain sequence. A yeast two-hybrid analysis and a transgenic experiment indicated that the WLHS1-A protein had no apparent function. The B and D genome homoeologs, WLHS1-B and WLHS1-D, respectively, had an intact MADS box gene structure, but WLHS1-B was predominantly silenced by cytosine methylation. Consequently, of the three WLHS1 homoeologs, only WLHS1-D functions in hexaploid wheat. This is a situation where three homoeologs are differentially regulated by genetic and epigenetic mechanisms."

Since there are few PHS-resistant genetic resources in durum wheat, we introduced an R -gene for red seeds, the MFT gene, and the QPhs-5AL QTL, all of which are associated with PHS resistance, into durum wheat from a PHS-resistant bread wheat ( T. aestivum L.) cultivar, 'Zenkoujikomugi' (Zen), by backcross breeding. Developed near isogenic lines (NILs) with red seeds had a lower percentage germination (PG) and germination index (GI) than the recurrent parent, and seed color had the greatest effect. A NIL combining all three sequences had the lowest GI and PG, with a similar GI to that of 'Shiroganekomugi' bread wheat. Among NILs with white seeds, a NIL combining MFT and QPhs-5AL had the lowest GI and PG. As the combination of all three sequences from Zen conferred PHS resistance on durum wheat, PHS-resistant genetic resources in bread wheat can be used in breeding durum wheat."

In this study, the effects of microbial community dynamics and the interactions between wheat and watermelon plants, particularly the effect of wheat root exudates on watermelon resistance against F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum , were examined using a plant-soil feedback trial and plant tissue culture approach. The plant-soil feedback trial showed that treating watermelon with soil from wheat/watermelon companion cropping decreased watermelon wilt disease incidence and severity, increased lignin biosynthesis- and defense-related gene expression, and increased β-1,3-glucanase activity in watermelon roots. Furthermore, soil microbes can contribute to increasing disease resistance in watermelon plants. Tissue culture experiments showed that both exogenous addition of wheat root exudates and companion cropping with wheat increased host defense gene expression, lignin and total phenols, and increased β-1,3-glucanase activity in watermelon roots. In conclusion, both root exudates from wheat and the related soil microorganisms in a wheat/watermelon companion cropping system played critical roles in enhancing resistance to watermelon wilt disease induced by F. oxysporum f. sp. niveum ."

"23821595","abstracttext","Sprouting of grains in mature spikes before harvest is a major problem in wheat (Triticum aestivum) production worldwide. We cloned and characterized a gene underlying a wheat quantitative trait locus (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 3A for preharvest sprouting (PHS) resistance in white wheat using comparative mapping and map-based cloning. This gene, designated TaPHS1, is a wheat homolog of a MOTHER OF FLOWERING TIME (TaMFT)-like gene. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of the gene confirmed that TaPHS1 positively regulates PHS resistance. We discovered two causal mutations in TaPHS1 that jointly altered PHS resistance in wheat. One GT-to-AT mutation generates a mis-splicing site, and the other A-to-T mutation creates a premature stop codon that results in a truncated nonfunctional transcript. Association analysis of a set of wheat cultivars validated the role of the two mutations on PHS resistance. The molecular characterization of TaPHS1 is significant for expediting breeding for PHS resistance to protect grain yield and quality in wheat production."

"32385328","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a severe disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Qfhb1 is the most important quantitative trait locus (QTL) for FHB resistance. We previously identified wheat gene WFhb1-1 (aka WFhb1-c1) as a candidate for FHB resistance gene. Here we report that WFhb1-1 has been cloned. The gene (GenBank # KU304333.1) consists of a single exon, encoding a putative membrane protein of 127 amino acids. WFhb1-1 protein produced in Pichia pastoris inhibits growth of both F. graminearum and P. pastoris in culture. Western Blotting with anti- WFhb1-1 antibody revealed a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in WFhb1-1 accumulation, 12 hours post Fusarium inoculation in non-Qfhb1-carrier wheat but not in Qfhb1-carrier wheat. Overexpressing WFhb1-1 in non-Qfhb1-carrier wheat led to a significant decrease (p < 0.01) in Fusarium-damaged rachis rate, Fusarium-diseased kernel rate and DON content in harvested kernels, while silencing WFhb1-1 in Qfhb1-carrier wheat resulted in a significant increase (p < 0.01) in FHB severity. Therefore, WFhb1-1 is an important FHB resistance gene with a potential antifungal function and probably a key functional component of Qfhb1 in wheat. A model regarding how WFhb1-1 functions in FHB resistance/susceptibility is hypothesized and discussed."

The predicted protein of 916 amino acids contained the specific characteristics of the SBEIII protein: four highly conserved regions and a central (α/β)(8) barrel domain. The SBE activity of the protein expressed in Escherichia coli (BL21) was also measured and verified. During the wheat grain filling period, TaSBEIII was constitutively expressed. The role of the TaSBEIII gene in starch synthesis is discussed."

"26551671","abstracttext","As there are numerous pathogen species that cause disease and limit yields of crops, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum), single genes that provide resistance to multiple pathogens are valuable in crop improvement. The mechanistic basis of multi-pathogen resistance is largely unknown. Here we use comparative genomics, mutagenesis and transformation to isolate the wheat Lr67 gene, which confers partial resistance to all three wheat rust pathogen species and powdery mildew. The Lr67 resistance gene encodes a predicted hexose transporter (LR67res) that differs from the susceptible form of the same protein (LR67sus) by two amino acids that are conserved in orthologous hexose transporters. Sugar uptake assays show that LR67sus, and related proteins encoded by homeoalleles, function as high-affinity glucose transporters. LR67res exerts a dominant-negative effect through heterodimerization with these functional transporters to reduce glucose uptake. Alterations in hexose transport in infected leaves may explain its ability to reduce the growth of multiple biotrophic pathogen species."

"16477135","abstracttext","To investigate whether homologs of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) LRK10 gene was expressed in powdery mildew-resistant lines after inoculation with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, one degenerate primer for 5'-RACE was designed according to the 6th kinase subdomain of LRK10 and other plant kinases. 5'-RACE was performed with the template cDNA synthesized with RNA extracted from seedling leaves of a powdery mildew-resistant wheat line ""99-2439"" after inoculation with B. graminis. One 1551 bp cDNA fragment representing a protein kinase gene was obtained (S1125, GenBank accession number: AY584533). Subsequently, a 2255-bp full-length cDNA clone with a complete encoding region (open reading frame, ORF) was obtained by RACE. The clone encodes a polypeptide consisting of 637 amino acid residues. The result of homology search showed that it belongs to a receptor-like kinase gene family in wheat, which was named as wlrk (wheat leaf rust kinase) previously. Similar to LRK10, this protein kinase has five distinct domains: a hydrophobic signal sequence at the amino-terminus, a putative extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, a highly charged sequence and a serine/threonine kinase domain at the carboxy-terminus, and thus it was named as TaLRK (Triticum aestivum LRK). The expression pattern of TaLRK at transcription level in leaves after B. graminis infection was investigated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (semi-QRT-PCR), using wheat actin gene as a control. The result showed that the transcription of TaLRK was significantly enhanced by B. graminis infection. The expression pattern of TaLRK in different tissues showed that this new wheat RLK gene was expressed only in green parts of wheat. This study suggests that TaLRK may function in wheat powdery mildew resistance responses."

The nucleotide sequence of the promoter from position -1191 to -650 with respect to the transcription start site was determined, to add to that already determined. Analysis of this region of the promoter revealed the presence of an additional copy of part of the primary enhancer sequence and sequences related to regulatory elements present in other wheat seed protein genes. A chimaeric gene was constructed comprising the 5' flanking region of the Glu-1D-1 gene from position -1191 to +58, the coding region of the UID:A (Gus) gene, and the nopaline synthase (Nos) gene terminator. This chimaeric gene was introduced into wheat (Triticum durum cv. Ofanto) by particle bombardment of inflorescence explants. Two independent transgenic lines were produced, and both showed expression of the Gus gene specifically in the endosperm during mid-development (first detected 10-12 d after anthesis). Histochemical analysis of homozygous T(2) seed confirmed this pattern of expression, and showed that expression was initiated first in the central lobes of the starchy endosperm, and then spread throughout the endosperm tissue, while no expression was detected in the aleurone layer. Native HMW subunit protein was detectable by Western analysis 12-14 d after anthesis, consistent with concurrent onset of activity of the native and introduced HMW subunit gene promoters."

"32527734","abstracttext","Crossovers (COs) ensure accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis while creating novel allelic combinations. Here, we show that allotetraploid (AABB) durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum ) utilizes two pathways of meiotic recombination. The class I pathway requires MSH4 and MSH5 (MutSγ) to maintain the obligate CO/chiasma and accounts for ∼85% of meiotic COs, whereas the residual ∼15% are consistent with the class II CO pathway. Class I and class II chiasmata are skewed toward the chromosome ends, but class II chiasmata are significantly more distal than class I chiasmata. Chiasma distribution does not reflect the abundance of double-strand breaks, detected by proxy as RAD51 foci at leptotene, but only ∼2.3% of these sites mature into chiasmata. MutSγ maintains the obligate chiasma despite a 5.4-kb deletion in MSH5B rendering it nonfunctional, which occurred early in the evolution of tetraploid wheat and was then domesticated into hexaploid (AABBDD) common wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), as well as an 8-kb deletion in MSH4D in hexaploid wheat, predicted to create a nonfunctional pseudogene. Stepwise loss of MSH5B and MSH4D following hybridization and whole-genome duplication may have occurred due to gene redundancy (as functional copies of MSH5A , MSH4A , and MSH4B are still present in the tetraploid and MSH5A , MSH5D , MSH4A , and MSH4B are present in the hexaploid) or as an adaptation to modulate recombination in allopolyploid wheat."

We assembled seven chromosome-scale pseudomolecules and identified protein-coding genes, and we suggest a model for the evolution of T. urartu chromosomes. Comparative analyses with genomes of other grasses showed gene loss and amplification in the numbers of transposable elements in the T. urartu genome. Population genomics analysis of 147 T. urartu accessions from across the Fertile Crescent showed clustering of three groups, with differences in altitude and biostress, such as powdery mildew disease.

GeNorm analysis of the real-time PCR performance of each gene among common wheat lines showed that the Waxy-D1 assay had the lowest M values with the best stability among all tested lines. All results indicated that the Waxy-D1 gene and its real-time PCR assay were most suitable to be used as an endogenous reference gene for common wheat DNA content quantification.

To date, identified Russian wheat aphid resistance genes are either located to the D chromosomes or to rye translocation of wheat, and resistance derived from the A or B genomes of tetraploid Triticum spp. would therefore be highly beneficial. Fifty-eight synthetic hexaploid wheat, derived from interspecific crosses of Triticum dicoccum Schrank. and Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. and their parents were evaluated for resistance to Russian wheat aphid under field conditions. Plots infested with aphids were compared with plots protected with insecticides. The T. dicoccum parents were highly resistant to Russian wheat aphids, whereas the Ae. tauschii parents were susceptible. Resistance levels observed in the synthetic hexaploids were slightly below the levels of their T. dicoccum parents when a visual damage scale was used. but no major resistance suppression was observed among the synthetics. Russian wheat aphid infestation on average reduced plant height and kernel weight at harvest in the synthetic hexaploids and the T. dicoccum parents by 3-4%, whereas the susceptible control 'Seri M82' suffered losses of above 20%. Because resistance in the synthetic hexaploid wheat is derived from their T. dicoccum parent, resistance gene(s) must be located on the A and/or B genomes. They must therefore be different from previously identified Russian wheat aphid resistance genes, which have all been located on the D genome of wheat or on translocated segments."

By phylogenetic analysis, annexins in these four species together with other monocots and eudicots were classified into six different orthologous groups. Pi values of each of Ann1-12 genes among T. aestivum, T. urartu, A. tauschii and H. vulgare species was very low, with the exception of Ann2 and Ann5 genes. Ann2 gene has been under positive selection, but Ann6 and Ann7 have been under purifying selection among the four species in their evolutionary histories. The nucleotide diversities of Ann1-12 genes in the four species were 0.52065, 0.59239, 0.60691 and 0.53421, respectively. No selective pressure was operated on annexin genes in the same species. Gene expression patterns obtained by real-time PCR and re-analyzing the public microarray data revealed differential temporal and spatial regulation of annexin genes in wheat under different abiotic stress conditions such as salinity, drought, cold and abscisic acid. Among those genes, TaAnn10 is specifically expressed in the anther but fails to be induced by low temperature in thermosensitive genic male sterile lines, suggesting that specific down-regulation of TaAnn10 is associated with conditional male sterility in wheat."

"14652757","abstracttext","Class-B floral homeotic genes are involved in specifying petal and stamen identity during flower development in plant species. Homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (called pistillody) has been observed in alloplasmic lines of bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) having the cytoplasm of a wild relative species, Aegilops crassa Boiss. To obtain information about the molecular mechanism underlying pistillody induction, we isolated two PISTILLATA ( PI)-type class-B MADS-box genes, WPI1 ( wheat PI STILLATA # 1) and WPI2, from wheat. Phylogenetic reconstruction indicated that WPI1 is orthologous to OsMADS4 and that WPI2 is probably an ortholog of OsMADS2. Both OsMADS4 and OsMADS2 genes were suggested to be PI orthologs in rice, and the function of OsMADS4 as a class-B gene was proven by the transgenic study. An in situ hybridization study demonstrated that the WPI1 gene is expressed in primordia of lodicules and stamens in developing florets in wheat. In the alloplasmic wheat line exhibiting pistillody, the WPI1 transcripts were not detected in the primordia of pistil-like stamens, whereas WPI1 was expressed in the lodicules. The wheat APETALA3 ( AP3)-type class-B MADS-box gene WAP3 ( wheat AP3) /TaMADS#82 showed an expression pattern similar to that of WPI1. These results suggest that pistillody in alloplasmic wheats is caused by alterations to the expression pattern of class-B MADS-box genes."

Phylogenetic analysis of the TaLTPs along with nsLTPs from Arabidopsis thaliana and rice, showed that all five types were shared across species, however, some type 2 TaLTPs formed wheat-specific clades. Gene duplication analysis indicated that tandem duplications contributed to the expansion of this gene family in wheat. Analysis of RNA sequencing data showed that TaLTPs were expressed in most tissues and stages of wheat development. Further, we refined the expression profile of anther-enriched expressed genes, and identified potential cis-elements regulating their expression specificity. This analysis provides a valuable resource towards elucidating the function of TaLTP family members during wheat development, aids our understanding of the evolution and expansion of the TaLTP gene family and, additionally, provides new information for developing wheat male-sterile lines with application to hybrid breeding."

"26508775","abstracttext","All genomes encode taxonomically restricted orphan genes, and the vast majority are of unknown function. There is growing evidence that such genes play an important role in the environmental adaptation of taxa. We report the functional characterization of an orphan gene (Triticum aestivum Fusarium Resistance Orphan Gene [TaFROG]) as a component of resistance to the globally important wheat (T. aestivum) disease, Fusarium head blight. TaFROG is taxonomically restricted to the grass subfamily Pooideae. Gene expression studies showed that it is a component of the early wheat response to the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON), which is a virulence factor produced by the causal fungal agent of Fusarium head blight, Fusarium graminearum. The temporal induction of TaFROG by F. graminearum in wheat spikelets correlated with the activation of the defense Triticum aestivum Pathogenesis-Related-1 (TaPR1) gene. But unlike TaPR1, TaFROG induction by F. graminearum was toxin dependent, as determined via comparative analysis of the effects of wild-type fungus and a DON minus mutant derivative. Using virus-induced gene silencing and overexpressing transgenic wheat lines, we present evidence that TaFROG contributes to host resistance to both DON and F. graminearum. TaFROG is an intrinsically disordered protein, and it localized to the nucleus. A wheat alpha subunit of the Sucrose Non-Fermenting1-Related Kinase1 was identified as a TaFROG-interacting protein based on a yeast two-hybrid study. In planta bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays confirmed the interaction. Thus, we conclude that TaFROG encodes a new Sucrose Non-Fermenting1-Related Kinase1-interacting protein and enhances biotic stress resistance."

"10364402","abstracttext","Superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene expression was investigated to elucidate its role in drought and freezing tolerance in spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum). cDNAs encoding chloroplastic Cu/ZnSODs and mitochondrial MnSODs were isolated from wheat. MnSOD and Cu/ZnSOD genes were mapped to the long arms of the homologous group-2 and -7 chromosomes, respectively. Northern blots indicated that MnSOD genes were drought inducible and decreased after rehydration. In contrast, Cu/ZnSOD mRNA was not drought inducible but increased after rehydration. In both spring and winter wheat seedlings exposed to 2 degrees C, MnSOD transcripts attained maximum levels between 7 and 49 d. Transcripts of Cu/ZnSOD mRNA were detected sooner in winter than in spring wheat; however, they disappeared after 21 d of acclimation. Transcripts of both classes of SOD genes increased during natural acclimation in both spring and winter types. Exposure of fully hardened plants to three nonlethal freeze-thaw cycles resulted in Cu/Zn mRNA accumulation; however, MnSOD mRNA levels declined in spring wheat but remained unchanged in winter wheat. The results of the dehydration and freeze-thaw-cycle experiments suggest that winter wheat has evolved a more effective stress-repair mechanism than spring wheat."

"18470179","abstracttext","Wheatgrasses (species of Agropyron complex) have previously been reported to be resistant to barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). To introgress this resistance into wheat, Triticum aestivum x Thinopyrum (Agropyron) intermedium hybrids were advanced through a backcrossing program and reaction to BYDV, as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is reported for the first time in backcross populations of wide hybrids between wheat and wheatgrasses. ELISA values revealed highly resistant to highly susceptible segregants in backcrosses. BYDV resistance was expressed in some backcross derivatives. Continued selection, based on cytology and ELISA in each generation, eliminated most of the unwanted wheatgrass chromosomes and produced self-fertile BYDV resistant wheat lines. The BYDV resistant lines with 2n = 42 had normal chromosome pairing similar to wheat, and their F1 hybrids with wheat had two univalents. DNA analyses showed that the source of alien chromatin in these BYDV resistant wheat lines is distinguishable from that in other Th. intermedium derived BYDV resistant wheat lines. Chromosome pairing and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses indicated that the 42 chromosome resistant Purdue wheat lines are substitution lines in which chromosome 7D was replaced by a chromosome from Th. intermedium that was carrying gene(s) for BYDV resistance."

"16315593","abstracttext","Polyploidy has been found to be common in plants. Bread or common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n=42) is a good example of allopolyploid made up of three diploid genomes A, B and D. In recent years, by the study of mimicking the origination of common wheat, it was found that changes of DNA sequence and gene expression occurred at the early stages of artificial allohexaploid between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii, which was probably favorable to genetic diploidization of new synthetic hexaploid wheat. Common wheat 99L2 is a new line stable in genetic, which was derived from the early self-pollinated generation of wide hybrids between common wheat and rye. In this study, it was found that at least two rye DNA segments had been introgressed into 99L2. This result suggested that a mechanism of alien DNA introgression may exist, which was different from the traditional mechanism of chromosome pairing and DNA recombination between wheat and alien species. Meanwhile, during the introgression process of alien rye DNA segments, the changes in DNA sequences of wheat itself occurred."

"21279533","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (scab), primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Wheat sharp eyespot, mainly caused by Rhizoctonia cerealis, is one of the major diseases of wheat in China. The defensin RsAFP2, a small cyteine-rich antifungal protein from radish (Raphanus sativus), was shown to inhibit growth in vitro of agronomically important fungal pathogens, such as F. graminearum and R. cerealis. The RsAFP2 gene was transformed into Chinese wheat variety Yangmai 12 via biolistic bombardment to assess the effectiveness of the defensin in protecting wheat from the fungal pathogens in multiple locations and years. The genomic PCR and Southern blot analyses indicated that RsAFP2 was integrated into the genomes of the transgenic wheat lines and heritable. RT-PCR and Western blot proved that the RsAFP2 was expressed in these transgenic wheat lines. Disease tests showed that four RsAFP2 transgenic lines (RA1-RA4) displayed enhanced resistance to F. graminearum compared to the untransformed Yangmai 12 and the null-segregated plants. Assays on Q-RT-PCR and disease severity showed that the express level of RsAFP2 was associated with the enhanced resistance degree. Two of these transgenic lines (RA1 and RA2) also exhibited enhanced resistance to R. cerealis. These results indicated that the expression of RsAFP2 conferred increased resistance to F. graminearum and R. cerealis in transgenic wheat."

"23046089","abstracttext","In this study, we report new insights into the function of a wheat (Triticum aestivum) MYB gene TaPIMP1 through overexpression and underexpression, and its underlying mechanism in wheat. Electrophoretic mobility shift and yeast-one-hybrid assays indicated that TaPIMP1 can bind to five MYB-binding sites including ACI, and activate the expression of the genes with the cis-element, confirming that TaPIMP1 is an MYB transcription activator. TaPIMP1-overexpressing transgenic wheat exhibited significantly enhanced resistance to the fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana and drought stresses, whereas TaPIMP1-underexpressing transgenic wheat showed more susceptibility to the stresses compared with untransformed wheat, revealing that TaPIMP1 positively modulates host-defense responses to B. sorokiniana and drought stresses. Microarray analysis showed that a subset of defense- and stress-related genes were up-regulated by TaPIMP1. These genes, including TaPIMP1, RD22, TLP4 and PR1a, were regulated by ABA and salicylic acid (SA). TaPIMP1-underexpressing transgenic wheat showed compromised induction of these stress-responsive genes following ABA and SA treatments. In summary, TaPIMP1, as a positive molecular linker, mediates resistance to B. sorokiniana and drought stresses by regulation of stress-related genes in ABA- and SA-signaling pathways in wheat. Furthermore, TaPIMP1 may provide a transgenic tool for engineering multiple-resistance wheat in breeding programs."

"25487419","abstracttext","Take-all (caused by the fungal pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Ggt) and common root rot (caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana) are devastating root diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Development of resistant wheat cultivars has been a challenge since no resistant wheat accession is available. GmPGIP3, one member of polygalacturonase-inhibiting protein (PGIP) family in soybean (Glycine max), exhibited inhibition activity against fungal endopolygalacturonases (PGs) in vitro. In this study, the GmPGIP3 transgenic wheat plants were generated and used to assess the effectiveness of GmPGIP3 in protecting wheat from the infection of Ggt and B. sorokiniana. Four independent transgenic lines were identified by genomic PCR, Southern blot, and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The introduced GmPGIP3 was integrated into the genomes of these transgenic lines and could be expressed. The expressing GmPGIP3 protein in these transgenic wheat lines could inhibit the PGs produced by Ggt and B. sorokiniana. The disease response assessments postinoculation showed that the GmPGIP3-expressing transgenic wheat lines displayed significantly enhanced resistance to both take-all and common root rot diseases caused by the infection of Ggt and B. sorokiniana. These data suggested that GmPGIP3 is an attractive gene resource in improving resistance to both take-all and common root rot diseases in wheat."

"28941084","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by the biotrophic fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a major threat to the production of wheat (Triticum aestivum). It is of great importance to identify new resistance genes for the generation of Bgt-resistant or Bgt-tolerant wheat varieties. Here, we show that the wheat copine genes TaBON1 and TaBON3 negatively regulate wheat disease resistance to Bgt. Two copies of TaBON1 and three copies of TaBON3, located on chromosomes 6AS, 6BL, 1AL, 1BL and 1DL, respectively, were identified from the current common wheat genome sequences. The expression of TaBON1 and TaBON3 is responsive to both pathogen infection and temperature changes. Knocking down of TaBON1 or TaBON3 by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) induces the up-regulation of defence responses in wheat. These TaBON1- or TaBON3-silenced plants exhibit enhanced wheat disease resistance to Bgt, accompanied by greater accumulation of hydrogen peroxide and heightened cell death. In addition, high temperature has little effect on the up-regulation of defence response genes conferred by the silencing of TaBON1 or TaBON3. Our study shows a conserved function of plant copine genes in plant immunity and provides new genetic resources for the improvement of resistance to powdery mildew in wheat."

"32480573","abstracttext","Hordeum marinum Huds. is a waterlogging-tolerant wild relative of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Greater root porosity (gas volume per root volume) and formation of a barrier to reduce root radial O2 loss (ROL) contribute to the waterlogging tolerance of H. marinum and these traits are evident in some H. marinum-wheat amphiploids. We evaluated root porosity, ROL patterns and tolerance to hypoxic stagnant conditions for 10 various H. marinum (two accessions) disomic chromosome addition (DA) lines in wheat (two varieties), produced from two H. marinum-wheat amphiploids and their recurrent wheat parents. None of the DA lines had a barrier to ROL or higher root porosity than the wheat parents. Lack of a root ROL barrier in the six DA lines for H. marinum accession H21 in Chinese Spring (CS) wheat indicates that the gene(s) for this trait do not reside on one of these six chromosomes; unfortunately, chromosome 3 of H. marinum has not been isolated in CS. Unlike the H21-CS amphiploid, which formed a partial ROL barrier in roots, the H90-Westonia amphiploid and the four derived DA lines available did not. The unaltered root aeration traits in the available DA lines challenge the strategy of using H. marinum as a donor of these traits to wheat."

"33033250","abstracttext","Tibetan wheat is grown under environmental constraints at high-altitude conditions, but its underlying adaptation mechanism remains unknown. Here, we present a draft genome sequence of a Tibetan semi-wild wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. tibetanum Shao) accession Zang1817 and re-sequence 245 wheat accessions, including world-wide wheat landraces, cultivars as well as Tibetan landraces. We demonstrate that high-altitude environments can trigger extensive reshaping of wheat genomes, and also uncover that Tibetan wheat accessions accumulate high-altitude adapted haplotypes of related genes in response to harsh environmental constraints. Moreover, we find that Tibetan semi-wild wheat is a feral form of Tibetan landrace, and identify two associated loci, including a 0.8-Mb deletion region containing Brt1/2 homologs and a genomic region with TaQ-5A gene, responsible for rachis brittleness during the de-domestication episode. Our study provides confident evidence to support the hypothesis that Tibetan semi-wild wheat is de-domesticated from local landraces, in response to high-altitude extremes."

Forty-six clones with loci on chromosomes of homoeologous group 3 and 28 clones on those of group 6 were surveyed for polymorphisms. Eleven and 12 clones detected T. tauschii loci in the two lines, respectively.

"18392625","abstracttext","The number of viable shoots influences the overall architecture and productivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The development of lateral branches, or tillers, largely determines the resultant canopy. Tillers develop from the outgrowth of axillary buds, which form in leaf axils at the crown of the plant. Tiller number can be reduced if axillary buds are not formed or if the outgrowth of these buds is restricted. The teosinte branched1 (tb1) gene in maize, and homologs in rice and Arabidopsis, genetically regulate vegetative branching. In maize, increased expression of the tb1 gene restricts the outgrowth of axillary buds into lateral branches. In this study, the maize tb1 gene was introduced through transformation into the wheat cultivar ""Bobwhite"" to determine the effect of tb1 overexpression on wheat shoot architecture. Examination of multiple generations of plants reveals that tb1 overexpression in wheat results in reduced tiller and spike number. In addition, the number of spikelets on the spike and leaf number were significantly greater in tb1-expressing plants, and the height of these plants was also reduced. These data reveal that the function of the tb1 gene and genetic regulation of lateral branching via the tb1 mode of action is conserved between wheat, rice, maize and Arabidopsis. Thus, the tb1 gene can be used to alter plant architecture in agriculturally important crops like wheat."

Gene editing in wheat was shown to be predominantly heterozygous, edits were inherited in a Mendelian fashion over multiple generations and no off-target effects were observed. Comparison of editing between the two species demonstrated that more stable, heritable edits were produced in wheat, whilst barley exhibited continued and somatic editing."

"32983219","abstracttext","Domain of unknown function (DUF) proteins constitute a great deal of families of functionally uncharacterized proteins in eukaryotes. The DUF966 gene family is found in monocotyledons, dicotyledons, mosses, and other species. However, little is known about the functions of DUF966 genes in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, we identified and characterized the TaDUF966 gene family members in wheat by in silico analysis. A total of 28 TaDUF966 proteins were identified in wheat. Phylogenetic analysis divided these proteins into two groups (Groups I and II). Proteins in each group showed a highly conserved DUF966 domain and conserved motif distribution, implying their functional conservation. Analysis of gene expression profiling data showed that some TaDUF966 genes were induced by salt stress. We further confirmed the role of TaDUF966-9B in salt stress using virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) assay. Compared with the empty vector control, the TaDUF966-9B knockdown plants exhibited severe leaf curling at 10 days post-inoculation with BSMV under salt stress, suggesting that TaDUF966 genes play a vital role in salt stress tolerance in wheat. Taken together, these results expand our knowledge of the evolution of the DUF966 gene family in wheat and promote the potential application of these genes in wheat genetic improvement."

"32113949","abstracttext","Hairiness, which is a phenotypic trait common among land plants, primarily affects the stem, leaf, and floral organs. Plant hairiness is associated with complex functions. For example, glume hairiness in wheat is related to the resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and may also influence human health. In the present study, two pairs of near-isogenic lines (NILs) for glume hairiness, which were derived from a cross between a Tibetan semi-wild wheat accession (Triticum aestivum ssp. tibetanum Q1028) and a common wheat cultivar (T. aestivum 'Zhengmai 9023'), underwent a glume transcriptome analysis. We detected 27,935 novel genes, of which 18,027 were annotated. Additionally, 488 and 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in NIL1 and NIL2, respectively, with 37 DEGs detected in both NIL pairs. Moreover, 987 and 1584 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in NIL1 and NIL2, respectively, with 39 SNPs detected in both NIL pairs, of which most were located in the Hairy glume (Hg) gene region on chromosome arm 1AS. The annotation of the DEGs with gene ontology terms revealed that genes associated with hairiness in Arabidopsis and rice were similarly enriched. The possible functions of these genes related to glume hairiness were examined. The study results provide useful information for identifying candidate genes and the fine-mapping of Hg in the wheat genome."

Chalcone synthase (CHS) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of flavonoids; it is involved in biosynthesis of all classes of flavonoid compounds. Nevertheless, the Chs gene family in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been not characterized yet. The aim of the current study was to investigate structural and functional organization of the Chs genes and evolution of this gene family in bread wheat and relative species."
"30885129","abstracttext_results","The nucleotide sequences of the eight Chs copies in T. aestivum were identified. Among them, two homoeologous sets of the Chs genes were located on the short (Chs-A1, -B1, -D1) and the long (Chs-A4, -B4, -D4) arms of homoeologous group 2 chromosomes. Two paralogous gene copies in the B-genome (Chs-B2, -B3) were located in the distal regions of 2BS chromosome. To clarify the origin of Chs duplications in the B-genome the phylogenetic analysis with the Chs sequences of Triticum and Aegilops species carrying ancestral genomes was conducted. It was estimated that the first duplication event occurred in the genome of the common ancestor of Triticum and Aegilops genera about 10-12 million years ago (MYA), then another copy was formed in the ancestor of the B-genome about 6-7 MYA. A homology modeling revealed high sequence similarity of bread wheat CHS enzymes. A number of short deletions in coding regions of some Chs sequences are not expected to have any significant functional effects. Estimation of transcriptional activity of the Chs copies along with a comparative analysis of their promoters structure suggested their functional specialization, which likely contributed to the maintaining of the duplicated Chs genes in wheat genome."

"11175732","abstracttext","The puroindoline genes (pinA and pinB) are believed to play critical roles in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain texture. Mutations in either gene are associated with hard wheat. No direct evidence exists for the ability of puroindolines to modify cereal grain texture. Interestingly, puroindolines appear to be absent in cereal species outside of the tribe Triticeae, in which the dominant form of grain texture is hard. To assess the ability of the puroindolines to modify cereal grain texture, the puroindolines were introduced into rice (Oryzae sativa L.) under the control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. Textural analysis of transgenic rice seeds indicated that expression of PINA and/or PINB reduced rice grain hardness. After milling, flour prepared from these softer seeds had reduced starch damage and an increased percentage of fine flour particles. Our data support the hypothesis that puroindolines play important roles in controlling wheat grain texture and may be useful in modifying grain texture of other cereals."

In yeast one-hybrid system, TaDREB1, can specially activate the genes fused with the promoter containing three tandemly repeated copies of the wild-type DRE sequence: TACCGACAT. In different wheat cultivars, the Ta DREB1 gene is induced by low temperature, salinity and drought; and the expression of Wcs120 that contains DRE motifs in its promoter is closely related to the expression of TaDREB1. These results suggest that TaDREB1 functions as a DRE-binding transcription factor in wheat. We also observed the dwarf phenotype in transgenic rice (T0) overexpressing TaDREB1."

"17292659","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important staple crops world-wide. Gene-derived 'functional' markers (FMs, also called perfect or diagnostic markers elsewhere) would be the ideal tools for marker-assisted breeding of wheat but, at present, their utility is restricted by the limited availability of genes that control agronomic characters. This bottleneck will be overcome in the next decade by ongoing genomics projects. Another obstacle for assigning sequence to trait variation is the high level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) found in elite materials. Thus, although laborious, TILLING seems to be the most promising approach for targeting sites in genes of interest for FM development. Once larger numbers of FMs become available for wheat breeding, they might be useful in exploiting the fixed genetic variation that is present in regions of high LD."

So far only 42 have been annotated for common wheat (Triticum aestivum) due to its large genome. Here, we employed miRDeep-P, a program developed previously for retrieving miRNAs from deep sequencing data in plants, to parse 14 sequenced small RNA libraries of wheat using expression sequence tags (ESTs) as the reference in lieu of a complete genome sequence. This effort identified 145 miRNAs along with the corresponding stem-looped precursors with many differentially expressed in development and associated with powdery mildew infection. Examination of the phylogenetic distribution of these miRNAs and their target genes revealed that many are conserved in monocots. The set of miRNAs identified in this study is thus useful to further miRNA research in wheat and other important cereal crop species."

"24177538","abstracttext","We have demonstrated that foreign DNA can be delivered into cells of mature embryos of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using silicon carbide fibers (SCF). The highest transient expression of thegusA (GUS) gene was detected when dry embryos were vortexed for 10-30 min in a SCF-DNA solution containing 90-120 g/l of sucrose. Up to 100 (on average 20-40) blue expression units per embryo were observed. Scutellum side and epiblast of the intact wheat embryos are preferentially transformed. When embryos with the coleoptilar tip removed were treated and allowed to germinate, GUS staining was observed in emerging leaf tissues. The potential of this new approach for stable transformation of wheat is under investigation. It has been found that callus tissues induced from the SCF treated embryos contain GUS-expressing sectors one month after treatment."

"27080445","abstracttext","TAD1 (Triticum aestivum defensin 1) is induced during cold acclimation in winter wheat and encodes a plant defensin with antimicrobial activity. In this study, we demonstrated that recombinant TAD1 protein inhibits hyphal growth of the snow mold fungus, Typhula ishikariensis in vitro. Transgenic wheat plants overexpressing TAD1 were created and tested for resistance against T. ishikariensis. Leaf inoculation assays revealed that overexpression of TAD1 confers resistance against the snow mold. In addition, the TAD1-overexpressors showed resistance against Fusarium graminearum, which causes Fusarium head blight, a devastating disease in wheat and barley. These results indicate that TAD1 is a candidate gene to improve resistance against multiple fungal diseases in cereal crops."
"17246432","articletitle","Effects of an intercultivaral chromosome substitution on winterhardiness and vernalization in wheat."
"17246432","abstracttext","During a study on the genetic control of winterhardiness in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. group aestivum), a gene that affected vernalization was found on chromosome 3B in the winter wheat cultivar ;Wichita.' When chromosome 3B from Wichita was substituted into the winter wheat cultivar ;Cheyenne,' the resultant substitution line exhibited a spring growth habit. This is unusual since a cross between the cultivars Wichita and Cheyenne results in progeny that exhibit the winter growth habit. The F(2) plants from a cross of the 3B substitution line to Cheyenne, the recipient parent, segregated 3:1 for heading/no heading response in the absence of vernalization (chi(2) = 2.44). Earliness of heading appeared to be due to an additive effect of the 3B gene as shown by the segregation ratio 1:2:1 (early heading-later heading-no heading) (chi(2) = 2.74). This vernalization gene differs from previously described vernalization genes because, while dominant in a Cheyenne background, its expression is suppressed in Wichita. The gene may have an effect on winter hardiness in Wichita. In a field test for winter survival the 3B substitution line had only 5% survival, while Wichita and Cheyenne had 50 and 80% survival, respectively. No other substitution line significantly reduced winter survival. The difference between Wichita and Cheyenne in winterhardiness may be due to the vernalization gene carried on the 3B chromosome."

"25260248","abstracttext","Powdery mildew of wheat is caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). Although many wheat cultivars resistant to this disease have been developed, little is known about their resistance mechanisms. The aim of this study was to identify proteins showing changes in abundance during the resistance response of the wheat line N0308 infected by Bgt. In two-dimensional electrophoresis analyses, 45 spots on the gels showed significant changes in abundance at 24, 48, and 72 h after inoculation, as compared to non-inoculated plants. Of these 45 proteins, 44 were identified by mass spectrometry analysis using the NCBInr database of Triticum aestivum (26 spots) and closely related species in the Triticum genus (18 spots). These proteins were associated with the defense response, photosynthesis, metabolism, and other cellular processes in wheat. Most of the up-regulated proteins were identified as stress- and defense-related proteins. In particular, the product of a specific powdery mildew resistance gene (Pm3b and its homolog) and some other defense- and pathogenesis-related proteins were overexpressed. The resistance gene product mediates the immune response and coordinates other cellular processes during the resistance response to Bgt."

"32060175","abstracttext","Six subspecies of hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) have been identified, but the origin of Indian dwarf wheat ( Triticum sphaerococcum ), the only subspecies with round grains, is currently unknown. Here, we isolated the grain-shape gene Tasg-D1 in T sphaerococcum via positional cloning. Tasg-D1 encodes a Ser/Thr protein kinase glycogen synthase kinase3 (STKc_GSK3) that negatively regulates brassinosteroid signaling. Expression of TaSG-D1 and the mutant form Tasg-D1 in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) suggested that a single amino acid substitution in the Thr-283-Arg-284-Glu-285-Glu-286 domain of TaSG-D1 enhances protein stability in response to brassinosteroids, likely leading to formation of round grains in wheat. This gain-of-function mutation has pleiotropic effects on plant architecture and exhibits incomplete dominance. Haplotype analysis of 898 wheat accessions indicated that the origin of T sphaerococcum in ancient India involved at least two independent mutations of TaSG-D1 Our results demonstrate that modest genetic changes in a single gene can induce dramatic phenotypic changes."

"23358862","abstracttext","The emergence of the highly virulent Ug99 race complex of the stem rust fungus (Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. and Henn.) threatens wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production worldwide. One of the effective genes against the Ug99 race complex is Sr44, which was derived from Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth and D.R. Dewey and mapped to the short arm of 7J (designated 7J#1S) present in the noncompensating T7DS-7J#1L∙7J#1S translocation. Noncompensating wheat-alien translocations are known to cause genomic duplications and deficiencies leading to poor agronomic performance, precluding their direct use in wheat improvement. The present study was initiated to produce compensating wheat-Th. intermedium Robertsonian translocations with Sr44 resistance. One compensating RobT was identified consisting of the wheat 7DL arm translocated to the Th. intermedium 7J#1S arm resulting in T7DL∙7J#1S. The T7DL∙7J#1S stock was designated as TA5657. The 7DL∙7J#1S stock carries Sr44 and has resistance to the Ug99 race complex. This compensating RobT with Sr44 resistance may be useful in wheat improvement. In addition, we identified an unnamed stem rust resistance gene located on the 7J#1L arm that confers resistance not only to Ug99, but also to race TRTTF, which is virulent to Sr44. However, the action of the second gene can be modified by the presence of suppressors in the recipient wheat cultivars."

"25251214","abstracttext","The existence of hybrid dwarfs from intraspecific crosses in wheat (Triticum aestivum) was described 100 years ago, and the genetics underlying hybrid dwarfness are well understood. In this study, we report a dwarf phenotype in interspecific hybrids between wheat and rye (Secale cereale). We identified two rye lines that produce hybrid dwarfs with wheat and have none of the hitherto known hybrid dwarfing genes. Genetic analyses revealed that both rye lines carry a single allelic gene responsible for the dwarf phenotype. This gene was designated Hdw-R1 (Hybrid dwarf-R1). Application of gibberellic acid (GA3 ) to both intraspecific (wheat-wheat) and interspecific (wheat-rye) hybrids showed that hybrid dwarfness cannot be overcome by treatment with this phytohormone. Histological analysis of shoot apices showed that wheat-rye hybrids with the dwarf phenotype at 21 and 45 days after germination failed to develop further. Shoot apices of dwarf plants did not elongate, did not form new primordia and had a dome-shaped appearance in the seed. The possible relationship between hybrid dwarfness and the genes responsible for the transition from vegetative to generative growth stage is discussed."

"27364458","abstracttext","The necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis is a major pathogen of sharp eyespot that is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Little is known about roles of MYB genes in wheat defense response to R. cerealis. In this study, TaRIM1, a R. cerealis-induced wheat MYB gene, was identified by transcriptome analysis, then cloned from resistant wheat CI12633, and its function and preliminary mechanism were studied. Sequence analysis showed that TaRIM1 encodes a R2R3-MYB transcription factor with transcription-activation activity. The molecular-biological assays revealed that the TaRIM1 protein localizes to nuclear and can bind to five MYB-binding site cis-elements. Functional dissection results showed that following R. cerealis inoculation, TaRIM1 silencing impaired the resistance of wheat CI12633, whereas TaRIM1 overexpression significantly increased resistance of transgenic wheat compared with susceptible recipient. TaRIM1 positively regulated the expression of five defense genes (Defensin, PR10, PR17c, nsLTP1, and chitinase1) possibly through binding to MYB-binding sites in their promoters. These results suggest that the R2R3-MYB transcription factor TaRIM1 positively regulates resistance response to R. cerealis infection through modulating the expression of a range of defense genes, and that TaRIM1 is a candidate gene to improve sharp eyespot resistance in wheat."

"28566710","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum), one of the world's most important crops, is facing unprecedented challenges due to global warming. To evaluate the gene resources for heat adaptation in hexaploid wheat, small heat shock proteins (sHSPs), the key plant heat protection genes, were comprehensively analysed in wheat and related species. We found that the sHSPs of hexaploid wheat were massively expanded in A and B subgenomes with intrachromosomal duplications during polyploidization. These expanded sHSPs were under similar purifying selection and kept the expressional patterns with the original copies. Generally, a strong purifying selection acted on the α-crystallin domain (ACD) and theoretically constrain conserved function. Meanwhile, weaker purifying selection and strong positive selection acted on the N-terminal region, which conferred sHSP flexibility, allowing adjustments to a wider range of substrates in response to genomic and environmental changes. Notably, in CI, CV, ER, MI and MII subfamilies, gene duplications, expression variations and functional divergence occurred before wheat polyploidization. Our results indicate the massive expansion of active sHSPs in hexaploid wheat may also provide more raw materials for evolving functional novelties and generating genetic diversity to face future global climate changes, and highlight the expansion of stress response genes with wheat polyploidization."

"32784820","abstracttext","The domain of unknown function 26 (DUF26), harboring a conserved cysteine-rich motif (C-X8-C-X2-C), is unique to land plants. Several cysteine-rich repeat proteins (CRRs), belonging to DUF26-containing proteins, have been implicated in the defense against fungal pathogens in ginkgo, cotton, and maize. However, little is known about the functional roles of CRRs in the important staple crop wheat ( Triticum aestivum ). In this study, we identified a wheat CRR-encoding gene TaCRR1 through transcriptomic analysis, and dissected the defense role of TaCRR1 against the soil-borne fungi Rhizoctonia cerealis and Bipolaris sorokiniana , causal pathogens of destructive wheat diseases. TaCRR1 transcription was up-regulated in wheat towards B. Sorokiniana or R. cerealis infection. The deduced TaCRR1 protein contained a signal peptide and two DUF26 domains. Heterologously-expressed TaCRR1 protein markedly inhibited the mycelia growth of B. sorokiniana and R. cerealis . Furthermore, the silencing of TaCRR1 both impaired host resistance to B. sorokiniana and R . cerealis and repressed the expression of several pathogenesis-related genes in wheat. These results suggest that the TaCRR1 positively participated in wheat defense against both B. sorokiniana and R. cerealis through its antifungal activity and modulating expression of pathogenesis-related genes. Thus, TaCRR1 is a candidate gene for improving wheat resistance to B. sorokiniana and R. cerealis ."

"17272858","abstracttext","Seventy-two Xinjiang Triticum and Triticum polonicum accessions were subjected to AFLP analyses to discuss the origin of Triticum petropavlovskyi. A total of 91 putative loci were produced by four primer combinations. Among them 56 loci were polymorphic, which is equivalent to 61.53 % of the total number of putative loci. Genetic diversity among 11 T. petropavlovskyi accessions was narrow due to the lowest number (32) of polymorphic loci among the wheat species. Forty four polymorphic loci were found in T. aestivum and T. compactum, whereas the highest polymorphism was observed in T. polonicum. On the basis of the UPGMA clustering and PCO grouping and genetic similarity estimates from the AFLPs, we noted that T. petropavlovskyi was more closely related to the Chinese accessions of T. polonicum than to T. polonicum from other countries. Two accessions of T. aestivum were grouped with T. petropavlovskyi in the UPGMA clustering. Both of them were similar to T. petropavlovskyi in respect of spike structure, i.e. the presence of awn, glume awn and also the presence of leaf pubescence. Six loci, which were commonly absent in Chinese T. polonicum, were also absent in almost all of the T. petropavlovskyi accessions. Findings of this study reduced the probability of an independent allopolyploidization event in the origin of T. petropavlovskyi and indicated a greater degree of gene flow between T. aestivum and T. polonicum leading to T. petropavlovskyi. It is most likely that the P-gene of T. petropavlovskyi hexaploid wheat was introduced from T. polonicum to T. aestivum via a spontaneous introgression or breeding effort."

"16177912","abstracttext","The MADS box genes are essential for floral development of Arabidopsis because they regulate flowering time and the development of floral organs. In this study, a MADS box gene, TaMADS1, was isolated and characterized from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The analysis of amino acid sequences and phylogenetic tree suggested that the TaMADS1 gene might be a SEPALLATA (SEP)-like gene. RNA hybridization indicated that the TaMADS1 transcripts began to accumulate in spikelets, and then, in floret primordia and floral organ primordia in wheat. In the later stage of floret development, the TaMADS1 transcripts accumulated in four whorls of young floral organs. The ectopic expression of TaMADS1 in Arabidopsis caused early flowering and altered the development of all floral organs. Further studies demonstrated that the early flowering phenotype in transgenic plants could be correlated with the upregulation of some flowering time genes and flower meristem identity genes. Our results suggest that TaMADS1 could be a putative SEP-like gene, and has diverse roles in flower development."

"21457711","abstracttext","Based on our microarray-analysis results of the salt tolerant wheat mutant, RH8706-49, an unknown salt-induced gene containing a conserved DUF662 domain was identified and cloned; we named this gene TaSRG (Triticum aestivum Salt Response Gene). Real-time quantitative PCR analyses showed that the expression of this gene was affected by salt, drought, cold, ABA and other stress conditions. The overexpression of TaSRG in wild-type Arabidopsis resulted in increased salt tolerance compared with wild-type plants. In addition, subcellular localisation revealed that TaSRG encodes a protein that was found mainly in the nucleus. Our results suggest that wheat TaSRG might encode a transcription factor that could be utilised for enhancing stress tolerance in a wide range of plants."

In plants, two different classes of Hbs have been identified: nonsymbiotic (class I) from both monocot and dicot species and symbiotic (class II) Hbs from nitrogen-fixing plants. This work reports the cloning and analysis of three nonsymbiotic Hb genes from wheat (Triticum aestivum) and potato (Solanum tuberosum). The Hb cDNAs were amplified by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using consensus oligonucleotide primers for nonsymbiotic Hbs.A wheat Hb cDNA (TaHb1) was isolated and shows a very high similarity to nonsymbiotic Hbs from Hordeum vulgare (98%) and Zea mays (83%). Another wheat Hb cDNA, designated TaHb2, exhibited strong similarity to truncated bacterial Hbs, the so-called 2-on-2 Hbs. In addition, a third Hb was cloned from potato, StHb. Expression analysis by RT-PCR demonstrated a very high expression level of the TaHb1 gene only in wheat roots. In contrast, the other wheat hemoglobin gene, TaHb2, was demonstrated to be constitutively expressed although differences in expression level in different tissues were observed. The expression of the TaHb1 gene is induced in wheat roots exposed to microaerobic conditions. The potato Hb gene, StHb, was highly expressed in roots and also in tubers and stem tissue although at much reduced levels."

"18061465","abstracttext","The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) CBF gene family is assumed to play important roles in development of low-temperature and freezing tolerance through activation of the downstream Cor/Lea genes. However, no direct evidence shows association of the wheat CBF genes with stress tolerance or any interaction between wheat CBF transcription factors and Cor/Lea gene activation. Here, we introduced Wcbf2, one of the wheat CBF genes, into the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) genome. Expression of Wcbf2 significantly increased the level of freezing tolerance in the transgenic tobacco plants without phenotypic retardation, and altered the expression patterns of tobacco genes, including cold-responsive genes. A transgenic tobacco plant expressing Wcbf2 was crossed to other transgenic plants expressing a GUS reporter gene under control of the wheat Cor/Lea gene promoter. Analysis of the F(1) plants showed that the WCBF2 protein positively regulated at least the expression of Wdhn13 and Wrab17. These results strongly indicate that WCBF2 functions as a transcription factor in the development of freezing tolerance in common wheat."

"16773333","abstracttext","To improve the transformation efficiency of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens, we explored the possibility of employing the basal portion of wheat seedling (shoot apical meristem) as the explants. Three genotypes of wheat were transformed by A. tumefaciens carrying beta-1, 3-glucanase gene. After vernalization, the seeds to be transformed were germinated. When these seedlings grew up to 2 approximately 5 cm, their coleoptile and half of the cotyledon were cut out, and the basal portions were infected by A. tumefaciens. A total 27 T(0) transgenic plants were obtained, and the average transformation efficiency was as high as 9.82%. Evident segregation occurred in some of the T(1) plants, as was indicated by PCR and Southern blotting analysis. Investigation of the T(2) plants revealed that some transformed plants had higher resistance to powdery mildew than the controls. Northern blotting revealed that beta-1, 3-glucanase gene was normally expressed in the T(2) plants, which showed an increased resistance to powdery mildew. The results above indicate that the exogenous gene has been successfully integrated into the genome of wheat, transmitted and expressed in the transgenic progeny. From all the results above, it can be concluded that Agrobacterium inoculum to the basal portion of wheat seedling is a highly efficient and dependable transformation method. It can be developed into a practicable method for transfer of target gene into wheat."

Guayacan INIA and its sister line Guayacan 2 was mapped to chromosome arm 6BS by identifying linked amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) and mapping two of the molecular markers in common wheat (T. aestivum) linkage maps of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative and Oligoculm × Fukuho-komugi populations. Comparison of infection type responses of the two resistant durums with common wheat testers carrying the previously mapped resistance genes Lr36 and Lr53 on 6BS, and their chromosomal positions, indicated that the resistance gene in durum wheat Guayacan INIA is a new leaf rust resistance gene, which was designated as Lr61. Gene Lr61 is effective against the P. triticina race BBG/BN predominant in northwestern Mexico and other races infecting durum wheat in various countries."

"26747046","abstracttext_key message","The aluminium tolerance of durum wheat was markedly enhanced by introgression of TaALMT1 and TaMATE1B from bread wheat. In contrast to bread wheat, TaMATE1B conferred greater aluminium tolerance than TaALMT1. Durum wheat (tetraploid AABB, Triticum turgidum) is a species that grows poorly on acid soils due to its sensitivity of Al(3+). By contrast, bread wheat (hexaploid AABBDD, T. aestivum) shows a large variation in Al(3+) tolerance which can be attributed to a major gene (TaALMT1) located on chromosome 4D as well as to other genes of minor effect such as TaMATE1B. Genotypic variation for Al(3+) tolerance in durum germplasm is small and the introgression of genes from bread wheat is one option for enhancing the ability of durum wheat to grow on acid soils. Introgression of a large fragment of the 4D chromosome previously increased the Al(3+) tolerance of durum wheat demonstrating the viability of transferring the TaALMT1 gene to durum wheat to increase its Al(3+) tolerance. Here, we used a ph1 (pairing homoeologous) mutant of durum wheat to introgress a small fragment of the 4D chromosome harboring the TaALMT1 gene. The size of the 4D chromosomal fragment introgressed into durum wheat was estimated by markers, fluorescence in situ hybridisation and real-time quantitative PCR. In a parallel strategy, we introgressed TaMATE1B from bread wheat into durum wheat using conventional crosses. Both genes separately increased the Al(3+) tolerance of durum wheat in both hydroponics and soil cultures. In contrast to bread wheat, the TaMATE1B gene was more effective than TaALMT1 in increasing the Al(3+) tolerance of durum wheat grown on acid soil."

The flag leaf sheath was normal in length resulting in spike placement below the flag leaf lamina. Segregation data suggest that one dominant gene controls this character. The canopy structure of a population of mutant plants is different from that of the normal type; therefore, this mutant can be used to evaluate light interception and physiological aspects of crop productivity."

"26424785","abstracttext_key results","Large genetic variation in tillering was observed, and more fertile shoots per plant were associated with more total shoots initiated, faster tillering rate, delayed tillering onset and cessation, and higher shoot survival. A total of 34 QTL for tillering traits were identified, and analysis of allelic effects confirmed the above associations. Low R:FR was associated with early tillering cessation, few total shoots, high infertile shoot number and shoot abortion, and these results concurred with the thinning and shading experiments. These effects probably resulted from an assimilate shortage for tiller buds or developing tillers, due to early stem elongation and enhanced stem growth induced by low R:FR. More fertile tillers normally contributed to plant yield and grain number without reducing yield and grain set of individual shoots. However, there was a decrease in grain weight, partly because of smaller carpels and fewer stem water-soluble carbohydrates at anthesis caused by pleiotropy or tight gene linkages."

"22042872","abstracttext","The Q gene encodes an AP2-like transcription factor that played an important role in domestication of polyploid wheat. The chromosome 5A Q alleles (5AQ and 5Aq) have been well studied, but much less is known about the q alleles on wheat homoeologous chromosomes 5B (5Bq) and 5D (5Dq). We investigated the organization, evolution, and function of the Q/q homoeoalleles in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Q/q gene sequences are highly conserved within and among the A, B, and D genomes of hexaploid wheat, the A and B genomes of tetraploid wheat, and the A, S, and D genomes of the diploid progenitors, but the intergenic regions of the Q/q locus are highly divergent among homoeologous genomes. Duplication of the q gene 5.8 Mya was likely followed by selective loss of one of the copies from the A genome progenitor and the other copy from the B, D, and S genomes. A recent V(329)-to-I mutation in the A lineage is correlated with the Q phenotype. The 5Bq homoeoalleles became a pseudogene after allotetraploidization. Expression analysis indicated that the homoeoalleles are coregulated in a complex manner. Combined phenotypic and expression analysis indicated that, whereas 5AQ plays a major role in conferring domestication-related traits, 5Dq contributes directly and 5Bq indirectly to suppression of the speltoid phenotype. The evolution of the Q/q loci in polyploid wheat resulted in the hyperfunctionalization of 5AQ, pseudogenization of 5Bq, and subfunctionalization of 5Dq, all contributing to the domestication traits."

At the end of the salt treatment, germination, water content (WC), total soluble protein content, and catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6) activity were affected in both species, while superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1) activity was affected in barley. Salinity affected WC, protein content, and CAT activity in both species, while it affected germination in barley and affected fresh weight and SOD activity in wheat after recovery. Physiological responses of both species were correlated. Expression of α-tubulin, Atls1, and Lls1 genes was down-regulated in barley after 250 mM NaCl treatment. HVA1 gene was highly (more than 50-fold) stimulated by salinity in barley. However, α-tubulin and Atls1 genes were down-regulated, and Lls1 gene was up-regulated in wheat after recovery from 250-mM NaCl treatment. Increase in HVA1 expression was not significant in wheat. The expression profiles of barley and wheat under salinity are different, and barley tended to regulate gene expression faster than wheat."

The genomic 1-SST gene is 3326 bp in length and contains four exons and three introns. Exon 2 has only 9 bp. This sequence encodes a part of a beta-fructosidase motif (NDPNG), a highly conserved motif found in plant invertases. This is the first report of a mini exon, one of the smallest exons known in plants, being found in a genomic 1-SST gene."

"26713352","abstracttext","The genome of Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight of wheat, contains two putative pectin methylesterase (PME)-encoding genes. However, when grown in liquid culture containing pectin, F. graminearum produces only a single PME, which was purified and identified. Its encoding gene, expressed during wheat spike infection, was disrupted by targeted homologous recombination. Two Δpme mutant strains lacked PME activity but were still able to grow on highly methyl-esterified pectin even though their polygalacturonase (PG) activity showed a reduced capacity to depolymerize this substrate. The enzymatic assays performed with purified F. graminearum PG and PME demonstrated an increase in PG activity in the presence of PME on highly methyl-esterified pectin. The virulence of the mutant strains was tested on Triticum aestivum and Triticum durum spikes, and a significant reduction in the percentage of symptomatic spikelets was observed between 7 and 12 days postinfection compared with wild type, demonstrating that the F. graminearum PME contributes to fungal virulence on wheat by promoting spike colonization in the initial and middle stages of infection. In contrast, transgenic wheat plants with increased levels of pectin methyl esterification did not show any increase in resistance to the Δpme mutant, indicating that the infectivity of the fungus relies only to a certain degree on pectin degradation."

"30983871","abstracttext","Triticum monococcum subsp. monococcum as a first cultivated diploid wheat species possesses desirable agronomic and quality characteristics. Drought and salinity are the most dramatic environmental stress factors that have serious impact on yield and quality of crops; however, plants can use alternative defense mechanisms against these stresses. The posttranscriptional alteration of gene expression by microRNAs (miRNAs) is one of the most conserved mechanisms. In plant species including wheat genomes, miRNAs have been implicated in the management of salt and drought stress; however, studies on einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum subsp. monococcum) are not yet available. In this study, we aimed to identify conserved miRNAs in einkorn wheat using next generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analysis. In order to include a larger set of miRNAs, small RNA molecules from pooled plant samples grown under normal, drought, and salinity conditions were used for the library preparation and sequence analysis. After bioinformatics analysis, we identified 167 putative mature miRNA sequences belonging to 140 distinct miRNA families. We also presented a comparative analysis to propose that miRNAs and their target genes were involved in salt and drought stress control in addition to a comprehensive analysis of the scanned target genes in the T. aestivum genome."

"31685951","abstracttext","Tetraploid emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon) is a progenitor of the world's most widely grown crop, hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), as well as the direct ancestor of tetraploid durum wheat (T. turgidum subsp. turgidum). Emmer was one of the first cereals to be domesticated in the old world; it was cultivated from around 9700 BC in the Levant 1,2 and subsequently in south-western Asia, northern Africa and Europe with the spread of Neolithic agriculture 3,4 . Here, we report a whole-genome sequence from a museum specimen of Egyptian emmer wheat chaff, 14 C dated to the New Kingdom, 1130-1000 BC. Its genome shares haplotypes with modern domesticated emmer at loci that are associated with shattering, seed size and germination, as well as within other putative domestication loci, suggesting that these traits share a common origin before the introduction of emmer to Egypt. Its genome is otherwise unusual, carrying haplotypes that are absent from modern emmer. Genetic similarity with modern Arabian and Indian emmer landraces connects ancient Egyptian emmer with early south-eastern dispersals, whereas inferred gene flow with wild emmer from the Southern Levant signals a later connection. Our results show the importance of museum collections as sources of genetic data to uncover the history and diversity of ancient cereals."

"11195336","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) and jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica) can cross with each other, and their self-fertile backcross progenies frequently have extra chromosomes and chromosome segments, presumably retained from wheat, raising the possibility that a herbicide resistance gene might transfer from wheat to jointed goatgrass. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) was used to clarify the origin of these extra chromosomes. By using T. durum DNA (AABB genome) as a probe and jointed goatgrass DNA (CCDD genome) as blocking DNA, one, two, and three A- or B-genome chromosomes were identified in three BC2S2 individuals where 2n = 29, 30, and 31 chromosomes, respectively. A translocation between wheat and jointed goatgrass chromosomes was also detected in an individual with 30 chromosomes. In pollen mother cells with meiotic configuration of 14 II + 2 I, the two univalents were identified as being retained from the A or B genome of wheat. By using Ae. markgrafii DNA (CC genome) as a probe and wheat DNA (AABBDD genome) as blocking DNA. 14 C-genome chromosomes were visualized in all BC2S2 individuals. The GISH procedure provides a powerful tool to detect the A or B-genome chromatin in a jointed goatgrass background, making it possible to assess the risk of transfer of herbicide resistance genes located on the A or B genome of wheat to jointed goatgrass."

"23535596","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world. However, the complex polyploid nature of its genome makes genetic and functional analyses extremely challenging. The A genome, as a basic genome of bread wheat and other polyploid wheats, for example, T. turgidum (AABB), T. timopheevii (AAGG) and T. zhukovskyi (AAGGA(m)A(m)), is central to wheat evolution, domestication and genetic improvement. The progenitor species of the A genome is the diploid wild einkorn wheat T. urartu, which resembles cultivated wheat more extensively than do Aegilops speltoides (the ancestor of the B genome) and Ae. tauschii (the donor of the D genome), especially in the morphology and development of spike and seed. Here we present the generation, assembly and analysis of a whole-genome shotgun draft sequence of the T. urartu genome. We identified protein-coding gene models, performed genome structure analyses and assessed its utility for analysing agronomically important genes and for developing molecular markers. Our T. urartu genome assembly provides a diploid reference for analysis of polyploid wheat genomes and is a valuable resource for the genetic improvement of wheat."

"24085441","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a newly discovered class of noncoding small RNAs that regulate gene expression by directing target mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. A large number of miRNAs have been identified in plants. Increasing evidence has shown that miRNAs play multiple roles in plant biological processes. So far, identification of miRNAs has been limited to a few model plant species, whose genomes have been sequenced. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide. To date, only a few conserved miRNAs have been predicted in wheat. Here, we showed the conserved miRNAs identified in wheat by expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis. All previously known miRNAs from Arabidopsis, rice, and other plant species were used in a BLAST search against the wheat EST database to identify novel wheat miRNAs by a series of filtering criteria. By this strategy, we identified 62 conserved miRNAs, belonging to 30 miRNA families, 48 of which were newly discovered in wheat. These newly identified wheat miRNAs may regulate 287 potential targets, which are involved in development, signal transduction, metabolic pathways, disease resistance, ion transportation, and environmental stress response."

"27148287","abstracttext","Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) is considered a promising source for improving stress resistances in domesticated wheat. Here we explored the potential of selected quantitative trait loci (QTLs) from wild emmer wheat, introgressed via marker-assisted selection, to enhance drought resistance in elite durum (T. turgidum ssp. durum) and bread (T. aestivum) wheat cultivars. The resultant near-isogenic lines (BC3F3 and BC3F4) were genotyped using SNP array to confirm the introgressed genomic regions and evaluated in two consecutive years under well-watered (690-710 mm) and water-limited (290-320 mm) conditions. Three of the introgressed QTLs were successfully validated, two in the background of durum wheat cv. Uzan (on chromosomes 1BL and 2BS), and one in the background of bread wheat cvs. Bar Nir and Zahir (chromosome 7AS). In most cases, the QTL x environment interaction was validated in terms of improved grain yield and biomass-specifically under drought (7AS QTL in cv. Bar Nir background), under both treatments (2BS QTL), and a greater stability across treatments (1BL QTL). The results provide a first demonstration that introgression of wild emmer QTL alleles can enhance productivity and yield stability across environments in domesticated wheat, thereby enriching the modern gene pool with essential diversity for the improvement of drought resistance."

"28496196","abstracttext","MYB transcription factors (TFs) have been implicated in various biology processes in model plants. However, functions of the great majority of MYB TFs in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have not been characterized. The soil-borne fungal pathogens Bipolaris sorokiniana and Rhizoctonia cerealis are the causal agents of important destructive diseases of wheat. Here, the TaPIMP2 gene, encoding a pathogen-induced MYB protein in wheat, was isolated through comparative transcriptomic analysis, and its defensive role was studied. TaPIMP2 was proved to localize in nuclei. TaPIMP2 responded in a different extent and speed upon infections of B. sorokiniana or R. cerealis. TaPIMP2 displayed different expression patterns after exogenous application of phytohormones, including abscisic acid, ethylene, and salicylic acid. Silencing of TaPIMP2 repressed resistance of wheat cultivar Yangmai 6 to B. sorokiniana, but did not alter resistance of wheat line CI12633 to R. cerealis. TaPIMP2 overexpression significantly improved resistance to B. sorokiniana rather than R. cerealis in transgenic wheat. Moreover, TaPIMP2 positively modulated the expression of pathogenesis-related genes, including PR1a, PR2, PR5, and PR10. Collectively, TaPIMP2 positively contributes to wheat resistance to B. sorokiniana possibly through regulating the expression of defense-related genes, and TaPIMP2 plays distinct roles in defense responses to different fungal infection."

"27951421","abstracttext","The role of exogenous salicylic acid (SA) in protecting wheat plants (Triticum aestivum) from contamination by the insecticide chlorpyrifos was investigated in this study. The wheat plants were grown in soils with different concentrations (5, 10, 20, and 40mgkg -1 ) of chlorpyrifos. When the third leaf emerged, the wheat leaves were sprayed with 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16mgL -1 of SA once a day for 6 days. The results showed that wheat exposed to higher concentrations of chlorpyrifos (≥20mgkg -1 ) caused declines in growth and chlorophyll content and altered the activities of a series of antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Interestingly, treatments with different concentrations of SA mitigated the stress generated by chlorpyrifos and improved the measured parameters to varying degrees. Furthermore, a reverse transcription and quantitative PCR experiment revealed that the activities of SOD and CAT can be regulated by their target gene in wheat when treated with SA. We also found that SA is able to block the accumulation of chlorpyrifos in wheat. However, the effect of SA was related to its concentration. In this study, the application of 2mgL -1 of SA had the greatest ameliorating effect on chlorpyrifos toxicity in wheat plants."

"29070517","abstracttext","RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful genetic tool to accelerate research in plant biotechnology and control biotic stresses by manipulating target gene expression. However, the potential of RNAi in wheat to efficiently and durably control the devastating stripe rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) remained largely under explored so far. To address this issue, we generated transgenic wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) lines expressing dsRNA targeting PsFUZ7 transcripts of Pst We analyzed expression of PsFUZ7 and related genes, and resistance traits of the transgenic wheat lines. We show that PsFUZ7 is an important pathogenicity factor that regulates infection and development of Pst A PsFUZ7 RNAi construct stably expressed in two independent transgenic wheat lines confers strong resistance to Pst Pst hyphal development is strongly restricted, and necrosis of plant cells in resistance responses was significantly induced. We conclude that trafficking of RNA molecules from wheat plants to Pst may lead to a complex molecular dialogue between wheat and the rust pathogen. Moreover, we confirm the RNAi-based crop protection approaches can be used, to our knowledge, as a novel control strategy against rust pathogens in wheat."

"31418861","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Given a growing global population coupled with increasingly challenging cultivation conditions, facilitating wheat breeding by fine-tuning important traits is of great importance. MADS-box genes are prime candidates for this, as they are involved in virtually all aspects of plant development. Here, we present a detailed overview of phylogeny and expression of 201 wheat MIKC-type MADS-box genes. Homoeolog retention is significantly above the average genome-wide retention rate for wheat genes, indicating that many MIKC-type homoeologs are functionally important and not redundant. Gene expression is generally in agreement with the expected subfamily-specific expression pattern, indicating broad conservation of function of MIKC-type genes during wheat evolution. We also found extensive expansion of some MIKC-type subfamilies, especially those potentially involved in adaptation to different environmental conditions like flowering time genes. Duplications are especially prominent in distal telomeric regions. A number of MIKC-type genes show novel expression patterns and respond, for example, to biotic stress, pointing towards neofunctionalization. We speculate that conserved, duplicated and neofunctionalized MIKC-type genes may have played an important role in the adaptation of wheat to a diversity of conditions, hence contributing to the importance of wheat as a global staple food."

"31536614","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) is essential for global food security. Rhizoctonia cerealis is the causal pathogen of sharp eyespot, an important disease of wheat. GATA proteins in model plants have been implicated in growth and development; however, little is known about their roles in immunity. Here, we report a defence role for a wheat LLM-domain-containing B-GATA transcription factor, TaGATA1, against R. cerealis infection and explore the underlying mechanism. Through transcriptomic analysis, TaGATA1 was identified to be more highly expressed in resistant wheat genotypes than in susceptible wheat genotypes. TaGATA1 was located on chromosome 3B and had two homoeologous genes on chromosomes 3A and 3D. TaGATA1 was found to be localized in the nucleus, possessed transcriptional activation activity, and bound to GATA-core cis-elements. TaGATA1 overexpression significantly enhanced resistance of transgenic wheat to R. cerealis, whereas silencing of TaGATA1 suppressed the resistance. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and ChIP-qPCR results indicated that TaGATA1 directly bound to and activated certain defence genes in host immune response to R. cerealis. Collectively, TaGATA1 positively regulates immune responses to R. cerealis through activating expression of defence genes in wheat. This study reveals a new function of plant GATAs in immunity and provides a candidate gene for improving crop resistance to R. cerealis."

"28704468","abstracttext","Blue aleurone is a useful and interesting trait in common wheat that was derived from related species. Here, transcriptomes of blue and white aleurone were compared for isolating Blue aleurone 1 (Ba1) transferred from Thinopyrum ponticum. In the genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis, only a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, ThMYC4E, had a higher transcript level in blue aleurone phenotype, and was homologous to the genes on chromosome 4 of Triticum aestivum. ThMYC4E carried the characteristic domains (bHLH-MYC_N, HLH and ACT-like) of a bHLH transcription factor, and clustered with genes regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis upon phylogenetic analysis. The over-expression of ThMYC4E regulated anthocyanin biosynthesis with the coexpression of the MYB transcription factor ZmC1 from maize. ThMYC4E existed in the genomes of the addition, substitution and near isogenic lines with the blue aleurone trait derived from Th. ponticum, and could not be detected in any germplasm of T. urartu, T. monococcum, T. turgidum, Aegilops tauschii or T. aestivum, with white aleurone. These results suggested that ThMYC4E was candidate Ba1 gene controlling the blue aleurone trait in T. aestivum genotypes carrying Th. ponticum introgression. The ThMYC4E isolation aids in better understanding the genetic mechanisms of the blue aleurone trait and in its more effective use during wheat breeding."

"27900400","abstracttext_key message","Here, we report the production of a wheat- Thinopyrum intermedium recombinant stock conferring resistance to wheat streak mosaic virus and Triticum mosaic virus. Wheat streak mosaic caused by the wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is an important disease of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. To date, only three genes conferring resistance to WSMV have been named and two, Wsm1 and Wsm3, were derived from the distantly related wild relative Thinopyrum intermedium. Wsm3 is only available in the form of a compensating wheat-Th. intermedium whole-arm Robertsonian translocation T7BS·7S#3L. Whole-arm alien transfers usually suffer from linkage drag, which prevents their use in cultivar improvement. Here, we report ph1b-induced homoeologous recombination to shorten the Th. intermedium segment and recover a recombinant chromosome consisting of the short arm of wheat chromosome 7B, part of the long arm of 7B, and the distal 43% of the long arm derived from the Th. intermedium chromosome arm 7S#3L. The recombinant chromosome T7BS·7BL-7S#3L confers resistance to WSMV at 18 and 24 °C and also confers resistance to Triticum mosaic virus, but only at 18 °C. Wsm3 is the only gene conferring resistance to WSMV at a high temperature level of 24 °C. We also developed a user-friendly molecular marker that will allow to monitor the transfer of Wsm3 in breeding programs. Wsm3 is presently being transferred to adapted hard red winter wheat cultivars and can be used directly in wheat improvement."

"1557028","abstracttext","The long-range structure of 5S rRNA gene clusters has been investigated in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by means of pulsed field gel electrophoresis. Using aneuploid stocks, 5S rRNA gene clusters were assigned to sites on chromosomes 1B, 1D, 5B and 5D. Cluster sizes were evaluated and the copy number of 5S DNA repeats was estimated at 4700-5200 copies for the short repeating unit (410 bp) and about 3100 copies for the long repeat (500 bp) per haploid genome. A comparison of wheat cultivars revealed extremely high levels of polymorphism in the 5S rRNA gene clusters. With one restriction enzyme digest all varieties tested gave unique banding patterns and, on a per fragment basis, 21-fold more polymorphism was detected among cultivars for 5S DNA compared to standard restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) detected with single copy clones. Experiments with aneuploid stocks suggest that the 5S rRNA gene clusters at several chromosomal sites contribute to this polymorphism. A number of previous reports have shown that wheat cultivars are not easily distinguished by isozymes or RFLPs. The high level of variation detected in 5S rRNA gene clusters therefore offers the possibility of a sensitive fingerprinting method for wheat. 5S DNA and other macro-satellite sequences may also serve as hypervariable Mendelian markers for genetic and breeding experiments in wheat."

"12856945","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) contains triplicated genomes derived from three distinct species. To better understand how different genomes are coordinated in the same nucleus of the hexaploid wheat, we globally compared gene expression of a synthetic hexaploid wheat with its diploid (Aegilops tauschii) and tetraploid (T. turgidum) parents by cDNA-AFLP display. The results suggested that the expression of a significant fraction of genes was altered in the synthetic hexaploid; most appeared to be diminished and some were activated. We characterized nine cDNA clones in details. Cytogenetic as well as genomic sequence analyses indicated that the gene silencing was not due to chromosome/DNA loss but was caused by gene regulation. Northern and RT-PCR divided these genes into three groups: (I) four genes were down-regulated nonspecifically, likely involving both parental orthologues; (II) four genes were down-regulated in an orthologue-dependent manner; (III) one gene was activated specifically in the synthetic hexaploid wheat. These genes were often altered non-randomly in different synthetic hexaploids as well as natural hexaploid wheat, suggesting that many of the gene expression changes were intrinsically associated with polyploidy."

"18943356","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Several wheat lines and cultivars of wheat (Triticum aestivum) originating from the southwestern region of China were found to be highly resistant to stripe rust by inoculation with the prevalent races (CYR30, CYR31, and CYR32) and newly emerged races (H46-4, SY11-4 and SY11-14) of the pathogen. An inheritance study of the resistance to stripe rust was carried out by crossing resistant AIM6 with susceptible BeiZ76. Results indicated that the resistance to stripe rust was controlled by a single dominant gene. The 112 F(2) plants chosen from the cross BeiZ76/ AIM6 were analyzed with 218 pairs of microsatellite primers to determine the map location of the resistance gene. A simple sequence repeat marker on chromosome arm 2BS, Xgwm410, showed polymorphism and co-segregation between stripe rust resistant and susceptible plants. From the pedigree, inheritance, molecular marker, and resistance response, it is concluded that the stripe rust resistance gene in wheat cv. Chuan-nong19 (CN19) and wheat lines AIM5 and AIM6 is a novel gene, designated YrCN19. The microsatellite primer Xgwm410 is a diagnostic marker of the resistance gene YrCN19, which has potential for application in the marker-assisted breeding of wheat."

"25729993","abstracttext","In previous studies, we first isolated one different protein β-1,3-glucanase using two-dimensional electrophoresis and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry from normal wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and chemical hybridization agent-induced male sterility (CIMS) wheat. In this experiment, β-1,3-glucanase activity and the expression of a callose deposition-related gene, UDP-glucose phosphorylase (UGPase), were determinate in normal, CIMS, and genetic male sterility (GS) wheat. β-1,3-glucanase activity was significantly different between the fertile and sterile lines during callose synthesis and degradation, but there was no difference between CIMS and GS wheat. The UGPase gene of callose deposition was highly expressed in the meiophase and sharply decreased in the tetrad stage. However, the expression of the UGPase gene was significantly different between the fertile and sterile lines. These data indicated that β-1,3-glucanase activity and the expression of the UGPase gene play important roles in the male sterility of wheat. Consequently, pollen mother cells (PMCs) might degenerate at the early meiosis stage, and differences in UGPase gene expression and β-1,3-glucanase activity might eventually result in complete pollen collapse. In addition, the critical period of anther abortion might be the meiosis stage to the tetrad stage rather than what we previously thought, the mononuclear period."

"31472082","abstracttext","As one of the largest gene families in plants, the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes (CYPs) are involved in diverse biological processes including biotic and abiotic stress response. Moreover, P450 genes are prone to expanding due to gene tandem duplication during evolution, resulting in generations of novel alleles with the neo-function or enhanced function. Here, the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) gene TaCYP81D5 was found to lie within a cluster of five tandemly arranged CYP81D genes, although only a single such gene (BdCYP81D1) was present in the equivalent genomic region of the wheat relative Brachypodium distachyon. The imposition of salinity stress could up-regulate TaCYP81D5, but the effect was abolished in plants treated with an inhibitor of reactive oxygen species synthesis. In SR3, a wheat cultivar with an elevated ROS content, the higher expression and the rapider response to salinity of TaCYP81D5 were related to the chromatin modification. Constitutively expressing TaCYP81D5 enhanced the salinity tolerance both at seedling and reproductive stages of wheat via accelerating ROS scavenging. Moreover, an important component of ROS signal transduction, Zat12, was proven crucial in this process. Though knockout of solely TaCYP81D5 showed no effect on salinity tolerance, knockdown of BdCYP81D1 or all TaCYP81D members in the cluster caused the sensitivity to salt stress. Our results provide the direct evidence that TaCYP81D5 confers salinity tolerance in bread wheat and this gene is prospective for crop improvement."

Three cereal species (Hordeum vulgare, Triticum aestivum and Triticum turgidum ssp. durum with and without the Na(+) exclusion gene Nax2) differing in Na(+) exclusion were grown in a potting mix under sodicity (Na(+) humate) and salinity (NaCl), and water use, leaf nutrient profiles and yield were determined. Under sodicity, Na(+)-excluding bread wheat and durum wheat with the Nax2 gene had higher yield than Na(+)-accumulating barley and durum wheat without the Nax2 gene. However, under salinity, despite a 100-fold difference in leaf Na(+), all species yielded similarly, indicating that osmotic stress negated the benefits of Na(+) exclusion. In conclusion, Na(+) exclusion can be an effective mechanism for sodicity tolerance, while osmoregulation and tissue tolerance to Na(+) and/or Cl(-) should be the main foci for further improvement of salinity tolerance in cereals. This represents a paradigm shift for breeding cereals with salinity tolerance."

"26452600","abstracttext","In cereals, several mildew resistance genes occur as large allelic series; for example, in wheat (Triticum aestivum and Triticum turgidum), 17 functional Pm3 alleles confer agronomically important race-specific resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis). The molecular basis of race specificity has been characterized in wheat, but little is known about the corresponding avirulence genes in powdery mildew. Here, we dissected the genetics of avirulence for six Pm3 alleles and found that three major Avr loci affect avirulence, with a common locus_1 involved in all AvrPm3-Pm3 interactions. We cloned the effector gene AvrPm3(a2/f2) from locus_2, which is recognized by the Pm3a and Pm3f alleles. Induction of a Pm3 allele-dependent hypersensitive response in transient assays in Nicotiana benthamiana and in wheat demonstrated specificity. Gene expression analysis of Bcg1 (encoded by locus_1) and AvrPm3 (a2/f2) revealed significant differences between isolates, indicating that in addition to protein polymorphisms, expression levels play a role in avirulence. We propose a model for race specificity involving three components: an allele-specific avirulence effector, a resistance gene allele, and a pathogen-encoded suppressor of avirulence. Thus, whereas a genetically simple allelic series controls specificity in the plant host, recognition on the pathogen side is more complex, allowing flexible evolutionary responses and adaptation to resistance genes."

"19352744","abstracttext","Chlorotoluron is a selective phenylurea herbicide widely used for broad-leaved and annual grass weed control in cereals. Variation in the response to chlorotoluron (CT) was found in both hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and wild tetraploid wheat (Triticum dicoccoides KöRN.). Here, we describe the comparative mapping of the CT resistance gene (Su1) on chromosome 6B in bread and wild wheat using RFLP markers. In bread wheat, mapping was based on 58 F(4) single-seed descent (SSD) plants of the cross between a genotype sensitive to chlorotoluron, 'Chinese Spring' (CS), and a resistant derivative, the single chromosome substitution line, CS ('Cappele-Desprez' 6B) [CS (CAP6B). In T dicoccoides, mapping was based on 37 F(2) plants obtained from the cross between the CT-susceptible accession B-7 and the resistant accession B-35. Nine RFLP probes spanning the centromere were chosen for mapping. In bread wheat Su1 was found to be linked to alpha-Amy-1 (9.84 cM) and Xpsr371 (5.2 cM), both on the long arm of 6B, and Nor2 (2.74 cM) on the short arm. In wild wheat the most probable linkage map was Nor2-Xpsr312-Su1-Pgk2, and the genetic distances between the genes were 24.8cM, 5.3cM, and 6.8cM, respectively. These results along with other published map data indicate that the linear order of the genes is similar to that found in T. aestivum. The results of this study also show that the Su1 gene for differential response to chlorotoluron has evolved prior to the domestication of cultivated wheat and not in response to the development and use of chemicals."

"26435710","abstracttext","Early flowering is an important trait influencing grain yield and quality in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in short-season cropping regions. However, due to large and complex genomes of these species, direct identification of flowering genes and their molecular characterization remain challenging. Here, we used a bioinformatic approach to predict flowering-related genes in wheat and barley from 190 known Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.) flowering genes. We identified 900 and 275 putative orthologs in wheat and barley, respectively. The annotated flowering-related genes were clustered into 144 orthologous groups with one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many orthology relationships. Our approach was further validated by domain and phylogenetic analyses of flowering-related proteins and comparative analysis of publicly available microarray data sets for in silico expression profiling of flowering-related genes in 13 different developmental stages of wheat and barley. These further analyses showed that orthologous gene pairs in three critical flowering gene families (PEBP, MADS, and BBX) exhibited similar expression patterns among 13 developmental stages in wheat and barley, suggesting similar functions among the orthologous genes with sequence and expression similarities. The predicted candidate flowering genes can be confirmed and incorporated into molecular breeding for early flowering wheat and barley in short-season cropping regions."

"25319364","abstracttext","The possible association with nitric oxide (NO) and ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle in regulating aluminum (Al) tolerance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was investigated using two genotypes with different Al resistance. Exposure to Al inhibited root elongation, and triggered lipid peroxidation and oxidation of AsA to dehydroascorbate and GSH to glutathione disulfide in wheat roots. Exogenous NO significantly increased endogenous NO levels, and subsequently alleviated Al-induced inhibition of root elongation and oxidation of AsA and GSH to maintain the redox molecules in the reduced form in both wheat genotypes. Under Al stress, significantly increased activities and gene transcriptional levels of ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase, and dehydroascorbate reductase, were observed in the root tips of the Al-tolerant genotype Jian-864. Nitric oxide application enhanced the activity and gene transcriptional level of these enzymes in both wheat genotypes. γ-Glutamylcysteine synthetase was not significantly affected by Al or NO, but NO treatments increased the activity of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase to a greater extent than the Al-treated wheat seedlings. Proline was significantly decreased by Al, while it was not affected by NO. These results clearly suggest that NO protects wheat root against Al-induced oxidative stress, possibly through its regulation of the AsA-GSH cycle."

"27765484","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD) is an allohexaploid species derived from two rounds of interspecific hybridizations. A high-quality genome sequence assembly of diploid Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the wheat D genome, will provide a useful platform to study polyploid wheat evolution. A combined approach of BAC pooling and next-generation sequencing technology was employed to sequence the minimum tiling path (MTP) of 3176 BAC clones from the short arm of Ae. tauschii chromosome 3 (At3DS). The final assembly of 135 super-scaffolds with an N50 of 4.2 Mb was used to build a 247-Mb pseudomolecule with a total of 2222 predicted protein-coding genes. Compared with the orthologous regions of rice, Brachypodium, and sorghum, At3DS contains 38.67% more genes. In comparison to At3DS, the short arm sequence of wheat chromosome 3B (Ta3BS) is 95-Mb large in size, which is primarily due to the expansion of the non-centromeric region, suggesting that transposable element (TE) bursts in Ta3B likely occurred there. Also, the size increase is accompanied by a proportional increase in gene number in Ta3BS. We found that in the sequence of short arm of wheat chromosome 3D (Ta3DS), there was only less than 0.27% gene loss compared to At3DS. Our study reveals divergent evolution of grass genomes and provides new insights into sequence changes in the polyploid wheat genome."
"15749759","articletitle","Molecular basis of evolutionary events that shaped the hardness locus in diploid and polyploid wheat species (Triticum and Aegilops)."
"15749759","abstracttext","The Hardness (Ha) locus controls grain hardness in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) and its relatives (Triticum and Aegilops species) and represents a classical example of a trait whose variation arose from gene loss after polyploidization. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis of the evolutionary events observed at this locus by comparing corresponding sequences of diploid, tertraploid, and hexaploid wheat species (Triticum and Aegilops). Genomic rearrangements, such as transposable element insertions, genomic deletions, duplications, and inversions, were shown to constitute the major differences when the same genomes (i.e., the A, B, or D genomes) were compared between species of different ploidy levels. The comparative analysis allowed us to determine the extent and sequences of the rearranged regions as well as rearrangement breakpoints and sequence motifs at their boundaries, which suggest rearrangement by illegitimate recombination. Among these genomic rearrangements, the previously reported Pina and Pinb genes loss from the Ha locus of polyploid wheat species was caused by a large genomic deletion that probably occurred independently in the A and B genomes. Moreover, the Ha locus in the D genome of hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum) is 29 kb smaller than in the D genome of its diploid progenitor Ae. tauschii, principally because of transposable element insertions and two large deletions caused by illegitimate recombination. Our data suggest that illegitimate DNA recombination, leading to various genomic rearrangements, constitutes one of the major evolutionary mechanisms in wheat species."

"15190370","abstracttext","Twelve genes encoding two closely related subtypes (ST1.1a and ST1.1b) of a sulphate transporter have been identified in the diploid wheats Aegilops tauschii, Triticum urartu, and Aegilops speltoides, as well as the hexaploid Triticum aestivum. Based on phylogenetic comparisons with other plant sulphate transporters, the ST1.1a and 1.1b subtypes aligned with group 1 of the plant sulphate transporter gene family. The exon-intron structure was conserved within the ST1.1a or ST1.1b genes; however, substantial variability in intron sequences existed between the two types. The high overall sequence similarity indicated that ST1.1b represented a duplication of the ST1.1a gene, which must have occurred before the evolution of the ancestral diploid wheat progenitor. In contrast with the close relationship of the T. urartu and Ae. tauschii sequences to the corresponding A and D genome sequences of T. aestivum, the divergence between the Ae. speltoides sequences and the B genome sequences suggested that the B genome ST1.1a gene has been modified by recombination. Transcript analysis revealed predominant expression of the ST1.1a type and an influence of sulphur availability on the level of expression."

"17248727","abstracttext","Lipopurothionins are complexes of basic polypeptides and polar lipids found in petroleum ether extracts of wheat endosperm. Location of the structural genes for the protein moiety and of genes probably controlling the lipid moiety has been achieved by analysis of compensated nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines of Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chinese Spring, as well as of other genetic stocks. There are two electrophoretic variants of the apoprotein designated alpha and beta purothionins. Structural genes for alpha purothionins are located in the long arm of chromosomes 1B and 1D, and for the beta variant in the long arm of 1A. These genes have been tentatively designated Pur-A1, Pur-B1, and Pur-D1. The aminoacid composition of purified alpha and beta purothionins from Triticum aestivum (genomes AABBDD) and T. durum (AABB), and of beta purothionin from T. monococcum (AA) is also consistent with this conclusion and suggests that the alpha purothionin encoded by gene Pur-B1 probably differs from that encoded by gene Pur-D1 in at least three positions of the aminoacid sequence. A gene (or genes) located in the short arm of chromosome 5D markedly affects the level of lipopurothionin but does not affect apoprotein synthesis. It is concluded that they control the lipid moiety which is required for solubility in petroleum ether."

Eleven independently transformed plant lines were obtained and five were analyzed for gene expression and resistance to WSMV. One line showed high resistance to inoculations of two WSMV strains. This line had milder symptoms and lower virus titer than control plants after inoculation. After infection, new growth did not show symptoms. The observed resistance was similar to the 'recovery' type resistance described previously using WSMV NIb transgene and in other systems. This line looked morphologically normal but had an unusually high transgene copy number (approximately 90 copies per 2C homozygous genome). Northern hybridization analysis indicated a high level of degraded CP mRNA expression. However, no coat protein expression was detected."

Southern blot analysis suggested there are three copies of the gene in wheat genome. The TaAOS mRNA could be strongly induced by exogenous JA, and the highest level JA was observed after a 10 h induction. In situ RNA hybridization of seedling indicated preferential gene expression in young leaves, especially in the parenchyma cells around the vascular bundles, and the hybridization also showed that exogenous La(3+) could not suppress the expression of TaAOS induced by JA."

"15471989","abstracttext","Acidity is a serious limitation to plant production on many of the world's agricultural soils. Toxic aluminium (Al) cations solubilized by the acidity rapidly inhibit root growth and limit subsequent uptake of water and nutrients. Recent work has shown that the ALMT1 gene of wheat (Triticum aestivum) encodes a malate transporter that is associated with malate efflux and Al tolerance. We generated transgenic barley (Hordeum vulgare) plants expressing ALMT1 and assessed their ability to exude malate and withstand Al stress. ALMT1 expression in barley conferred an Al-activated efflux of malate with properties similar to those of Al-tolerant wheat. The transgenic barley showed a high level of Al tolerance when grown in both hydroponic culture and on acid soils. These findings provide additional evidence that ALMT1 is a major Al-tolerance gene and demonstrate its ability to confer effective tolerance to acid soils through a transgenic approach in an important crop species."

A variance analysis for kernel hardness was conducted using 114 recombinant inbred lines (F7) from a cross between a synthetic and a cultivated wheat. The major gene involved in kernel hardness, ha (hard), known to be on chromosome arm 5DS, was found to be closely linked with the locus Xmta9 corresponding to the gene of puroindoline-a. This locus explained around 63% of the phenotypic variability but there was no evidence that puroindoline-a is the product of Ha (soft). Four additional regions located on chromosomes 2A, 2D, 5B, and 6D were shown to have single-factor effects on hardness, while three others situated on chromosomes 5A, 6D and 7A had interaction effects. Positive alleles were contributed by both parents. A three-marker model explains about 75% of the variation for this trait."

Significant differences were found between the aneuploid lines and the euploid control for the expression of both regenerable callus formation and callus growth rate. A model is proposed suggesting that a major TCR gene is located on 2DL and that 2AL and 2BS possess minor TCR genes. Furthermore, a major regulatory gene controlling the expression of TCR genes may be located on chromosome 2BL."

"28134326","abstracttext","Jasmonic acid (JA) signalling helps plants to defend themselves against necrotrophic pathogens and herbivorous insects and has been shown to influence the root microbiome of Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we determined whether JA signalling influences the diversity and functioning of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) microbiome and whether these effects are specific to particular parts of the plant. Activation of the JA pathway was achieved via exogenous application of methyl jasmonate and was confirmed by significant increases in the abundance of 10 JA-signalling-related gene transcripts. Phylogenetic marker gene sequencing revealed that JA signalling reduced the diversity and changed the composition of root endophytic but not shoot endophytic or rhizosphere bacterial communities. The total enzymatic activity and substrate utilisation profiles of rhizosphere bacterial communities were not affected by JA signalling. Our findings indicate that the effects of JA signalling on the wheat microbiome are specific to individual plant compartments."

Agropyron elongatum (Host) P.B.] chromosomes controlling blue aleurone color was crossed with a short-statured spring wheat ;Sonora 64' (T. aestivum). Isoline pairs of blue-disomic addition lines and nonblue euploid lines were produced by selecting plants segregating for blue aleurone for 12 generations. Nineteen of 20 blue aleurone lines were 2n = 44 addition lines, and one had 2n = 42 chromosomes. Several lines of evidence showed that this line had a spontaneous translocation in which the beta arm of wheat chromosome 4A was replaced by an Elytrigia chromosome arm carrying the blue aleurone gene. The Elytrigia chromosome in SH1-152-2 appeared to be homologous with E. pontica chromosome 4el(1), which also carries the blue aleurone gene. It was concluded that the spontaneous translocation originated from simultaneous misdivision of univalents and subsequent reunion at the centromere of chromosome arm 4Aalpha with the Elytrigia chromosome arm."

"30842265","abstracttext","BRI1-EMS suppressor (BES)/brassinazole-resistant (BZR) family transcription factors are involved in a variety of physiological processes, but the biological functions of some BES/BZR transcription factors remain unknown; moreover, it is not clear if any of these proteins function in the regulation of plant stress responses. Here, wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) brassinazole-resistant 2 ( TaBZR2 )-overexpressing plants exhibited drought tolerant phenotypes, whereas downregulation of TaBZR2 in wheat by RNA interference resulted in elevated drought sensitivity. electrophoretic mobility shift assay and luciferase reporter analysis illustrate that TaBZR2 directly interacts with the gene promoter to activate the expression of T. aestivum glutathione s-transferase-1 ( TaGST1 ), which functions positively in scavenging drought-induced superoxide anions (O 2 - ). Moreover, TaBZR2 acts as a positive regulator in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Exogenous BR treatment enhanced TaBZR2-mediated O 2 - scavenging and antioxidant enzyme gene expression. Taken together, we demonstrate that a BES/BZR family transcription factor, TaBZR2, functions positively in drought responses by activating TaGST1 and mediates the crosstalk between BR and drought signaling pathways. Our results thus provide new insights into the mechanisms underlying how BES/BZR family transcription factors contribute to drought tolerance in wheat."

Mapping data for almost 3,000 genes showed that the gene space spans the whole chromosome 3B with a 2-fold increase of gene density toward the telomeres due to an increase in the number of genes in islands. Comparative analyses with rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon revealed that these gene islands are composed mainly of genes likely originating from interchromosomal gene duplications. Gene Ontology and expression profile analyses for the 3,000 genes located along the chromosome revealed that the gene islands are enriched significantly in genes sharing the same function or expression profile, thereby suggesting that genes in islands acquired shared regulation during evolution. Only a small fraction of these clusters of cofunctional and coexpressed genes was conserved with rice and B. distachyon, indicating a recent origin. Finally, genes with the same expression profiles in remote islands (coregulation islands) were identified suggesting long-distance regulation of gene expression along the chromosomes in wheat."

"22942085","abstracttext","Rusts are the most important biotic constraints limiting wheat productivity worldwide. Deployment of cultivars with broad spectrum rust resistance is the only environmentally viable option to combat these diseases. Identification and introgression of novel sources of resistance is a continuous process to combat the ever evolving pathogens. The germplasm of nonprogenitor Aegilops species with substantial amount of variability has been exploited to a limited extent. In the present investigation introgression, inheritance and molecular mapping of a leaf rust resistance gene of Ae. caudata (CC) acc. pau3556 in cultivated wheat were undertaken. An F(2) population derived from the cross of Triticum aestivum cv. WL711 - Ae. caudata introgression line T291-2 with wheat cultivar PBW343 segregated for a single dominant leaf rust resistance gene at the seedling and adult plant stages. Progeny testing in F(3) confirmed the introgression of a single gene for leaf rust resistance. Bulked segregant analysis using polymorphic D-genome-specific SSR markers and the cosegregation of the 5DS anchored markers (Xcfd18, Xcfd78, Xfd81 and Xcfd189) with the rust resistance in the F(2) population mapped the leaf rust resistance gene (LrAC) on the short arm of wheat chromosome 5D.

Rye (Secale cereale L., 2 n = 2 × = 14, genome RR) offers a rich reservoir of powdery mildew resistant genes for wheat breeding program. However, extensive use of these resistant genes may render them susceptible to new pathogen races because of co-evolution of host and pathogen. Therefore, the continuous exploration of new powdery mildew resistant genes is important to wheat breeding program. In the present study, we identified several wheat-rye addition lines from the progeny of T. aestivum L. Mianyang11 × S. cereale L. Kustro, i.e., monosomic addition lines of the rye chromosomes 4R and 6R; a disomic addition line of 6R; and monotelosomic or ditelosomic addition lines of the long arms of rye chromosomes 4R (4 RL) and 6R (6 RL). All these lines displayed immunity to powdery mildew. Thus, we concluded that both the 4 RL and 6 RL arms of Kustro contain powdery mildew resistant genes. It is the first time to discover that 4 RL arm carries powdery mildew resistant gene. Additionally, wheat lines containing new wheat-rye translocation chromosomes were also obtained: these lines retained a short arm of wheat chromosome 5D (5 DS) on which rye chromosome 4R was fused through the short arm 4 RS (designated 5 DS-4 RS · 4 RL; 4 RL stands for the long arm of rye chromosome 4R); or they had an extra short arm of rye chromosome 4R (4 RS) that was attached to the short arm of wheat chromosome 5D (5 DS) (designated 4 RS-5 DS · 5 DL; 5 DL stands for the long arm of wheat chromosome 5D). These two translocation chromosomes could be transmitted to next generation stably, and the wheat lines containing 5 DS-4 RS · 4 RL chromosome also displayed immunity to powdery mildew.

Using the Brachypodium distachyon genome as a reference for the Triticeae, we classified gene clusters into orthologous, paralogous, and homoeologous relationships. Based on this wheat gene evolutionary classification, older duplicated copies (dating back 50 to 70 million years) exhibit more than 80% gene loss and expression divergence while recent duplicates (dating back 1.5 to 3 million years) show only 54% gene loss and 36 to 49% expression divergence."
"22136458","abstracttext_conclusions","We suggest that structural shuffling due to duplicated gene loss is a rapid process, whereas functional shuffling due to neo- and/or subfunctionalization of duplicates is a longer process, and that both shuffling mechanisms drive functional redundancy erosion. We conclude that, as a result of these mechanisms, half the gene duplicates in plants are structurally and functionally altered within 10 million years of evolution, and the diploidization process is completed after 45 to 50 million years following polyploidization."
"27833623","articletitle","A Simple and Efficient Approach to Elucidate Genomic Contribution of Transcripts to a Target Gene in Polyploids: The Case of Hexaploid Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)."
"27833623","abstracttext","Common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most economically important crops in the world, however, gene functional studies in this crop have been lagging mainly due to the complexity of its polyploid genome, which is derived through two rounds of intergeneric hybridization events that led to the presence of six copies for each gene. Elucidating the transcript contribution of each genome to the total expression of a target gene in polyploids such as hexaploid wheat has a paramount significance for direct discovery of genes and the associated molecular mechanisms controlling traits of agronomic importance. A polymerase chain reaction approach that involved primers amplifying DNA fragments unique to each homeolog of a target gene and quantitation of the intensity of the resulting fragment bands were able to successfully determine the genomic transcript contributions as a percentage of target gene's total expression in hexaploid wheat. Our results showed that the genomic contributions of transcripts to a target gene vary with genotype and tissue type, suggesting the distinct role of each homeolog in regulating the trait associated with the target gene. The approach described in this study is an effective and economical method to elucidate the genomic transcript contribution to the total expression of individual target genes in hexaploid wheat. It can also be applied to determine the transcript contribution of each genome towards the collective expression of a target gene in other economically important polypoid crop species."

"16403227","abstracttext_results","We obtained 230 distinct alpha-gliadin gene sequences from severaldiploid wheat species representing the ancestral A, B, and D genomes of the hexaploid bread wheat. The large majority of these sequences (87%) contained an internal stop codon. All alpha-gliadin sequences could be distinguished according to the genome of origin on the basis of sequence similarity, of the average length of the polyglutamine repeats, and of the differences in the presence of four peptides that have been identified as T cell stimulatory epitopes in CD patients through binding to HLA-DQ2/8. By sequence similarity, alpha-gliadins from the public database of hexaploid T. aestivum could be assigned directly to chromosome 6A, 6B, or 6D. T. monococcum (A genome) sequences, as well as those from chromosome 6A of bread wheat, almost invariably contained epitope glia-alpha9 and glia-alpha20, but never the intact epitopes glia-alpha and glia-alpha2. A number of sequences from T. speltoides, as well as a number of sequences fromchromosome 6B of bread wheat, did not contain any of the four T cell epitopes screened for. The sequences from T. tauschii (D genome), as well as those from chromosome 6D of bread wheat, were found to contain all of these T cell epitopes in variable combinations per gene. The differences in epitope composition resulted mainly from point mutations. These substitutions appeared to be genome specific."
"16403227","abstracttext_conclusion","Our analysis shows that alpha-gliadin sequences from the three genomes of bread wheat form distinct groups. The four known T cell stimulatory epitopes are distributed non-randomly across the sequences, indicating that the three genomes contribute differently to epitope content. A systematic analysis of all known epitopes in gliadins and glutenins will lead to better understanding of the differences in toxicity among wheat varieties. On the basis of such insight, breeding strategies can be designed to generate less toxic varieties of wheat which may be tolerated by at least part of the CD patient population."

Iron biofortification of wheat, instead of supplementation and food fortification, provides a pragmatic approach to solve the problem of iron deficiency. In this study, 144 diverse wheat genotypes were evaluated for grain iron and yield potential, to estimate the potential for the iron biofortification of high-yielding wheat varieties."
"31769035","abstracttext_results","Genotypes did not differ significantly across the species, but within species the differences were significant for grain iron content and the phytate:iron molar ratio.

"19421730","abstracttext","Threshability is an important crop domestication trait. The wild wheat progenitors have tough glumes enveloping the floret that make spikes difficult to thresh, whereas cultivated wheats have soft glumes and are free-threshing. In hexaploid wheat, the glume tenacity gene Tg along with the major domestication locus Q control threshability. The Q gene was isolated recently and found to be a member of the AP2 class of transcription factors. However, only a few studies have reported on the tough glume trait. Here, we report comparative mapping of the soft glume (sog) gene of diploid Triticum monococcum L. and tenacious glume (Tg) gene of hexaploid T. aestivum L. using chromosome-specific SSR and RFLP markers. The sog gene was flanked by Xgwm71 and Xbcd120 in a 6.8 cM interval on chromosome 2A(m)S of T. monococcum whereas Tg was targeted to a 8.1 cM interval flanked by Xwmc503 and Xfba88 on chromosome 2DS of T. aestivum. Deletion bin mapping of the flanking markers assigned sog close to the centromere on 2AS, whereas Tg was mapped to the most distal region on 2DS. Both 2AS and 2DS maps were colinear ruling out the role of chromosome rearrangements for their non-syntenic positions. Therefore, sog and Tg are not true orthologues suggesting the possibility of a diverse origin."

"11867697","abstracttext","A cDNA clone exclusively induced by aluminum (Al) was isolated from root apices of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by the differential display method. The predicted amino acid sequence exhibited homology to the multidrug resistance (MDR) proteins that is known as a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein superfamily. Thus this gene was named TaMDR1 (Triticum aestivum MDR). TaMDR1 was induced as a function of Al concentration in the range from 5 to 50 microM, which is in the range of Al content in natural acid soil environment. The concentration required for the induction was lower in the Al-sensitive cultivar than in the Al-tolerant cultivar, indicating that the accumulation of TaMDR1 mRNA was associated with the events caused by Al toxicity rather than Al tolerance. TaMDR1 was significantly induced by the exposure to lanthanum, gadolinium and ruthenium red, which are known as inhibitors of calcium channels. Furthermore, decreasing of calcium ion in growth medium caused stimulation of the gene expression. These results suggested that the induction of TaMDR1 is caused by the breaking of calcium homeostasis which occurred at early stage of Al toxicity."

In this study we surveyed crude extracts of the above-ground part of the common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) for major RNA-degrading enzymes using a substrate-based SDS-PAGE assay. Fifteen wheat and fourteen barley RNA-degrading enzymes, with apparent molecular masses ranging from 16.3 to 40.1 kD, were identified. These RNA-degrading enzymes were characterized by their response to pH changes and addition of EDTA and ZnCl2 to the preincubation or incubation buffers. The 33.2- to 40.1-kD wheat and barley, 31.7-kD wheat, and 32.0-kD barley enzyme activities were inhibited by both zinc and EDTA and were relatively tolerant to alkaline environment. The 22.7- to 28.2-kD enzymes were inhibited by zinc but stimulated by EDTA. The 18.8-kD enzyme exists in both wheat and barley. It was active in an acid environment, was inhibited by zinc, but was not affected by EDTA. Two enzyme activities (31.0 and 32.0 kD) are unique to the common wheat."

"10444098","abstracttext","The starch granules of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) contain a group of three proteins known as SGP-1 (starch granule protein-1) proteins, which have apparent molecular masses of 100, 108, and 115 kD. The nature and role of these proteins has not been defined previously. We demonstrate that these polypeptides are starch synthases that are present in both the starch granule and the soluble fraction at the early stages of wheat endosperm development, but that are exclusively granule bound at mid and late endosperm development. A partial cDNA clone encoding a fragment of the 100-kD protein was obtained by screening a wheat endosperm cDNA expression library using monoclonal antibodies. Three classes of cDNA were subsequently isolated from a wheat endosperm cDNA library by nucleic acid hybridization and were shown to encode the 100-, 108-, and 115-kD proteins. The cDNA sequences are highly homologous to class II starch synthases and have the highest homology with the maize SSIIa (starch synthase IIa) gene. mRNA for the SGP-1 proteins was detected in the leaf, pre-anthesis florets, and endosperm of wheat and is highly expressed in the leaf and in the grain during the early to mid stages of development. We discuss the roles of the SGP-1 proteins in starch biosynthesis in wheat."

Russian wheat aphid was more abundant on TAM 107 than on RWA E1. Russian wheat aphid days per tiller were greater at the higher infestation levels. Yield losses as a result of Russian wheat aphid infestation occurred most of the time with TAM 107 but rarely with RWA E1. Seed densities were reduced at higher infestation levels in TAM 107 at two locations. Russian wheat aphids per tiller had a negative relationship to yield in TAM 107 but not in RWA E1. In TAM 107 yield decreased as aphid densities increased, but yield remained constant regardless of initial aphid abundance on RWA E1 in all environments. Seed densities were reduced at higher infestation levels in TAM 107 at two locations. The resistance conferred by the Dn4 gene seems to be an effective management approach across a range of field conditions."

Gaertn. In order to determine the genetic control of floret and kernel number per spike in this line, chromosome addition and substitution lines that were derived from line 4844 were characterized by means of in situ hybridization, microsatellite (SSR), and gliadin analyses. Genomic in situ hybridization analysis with biotinylated P genomic DNA of A. cristatum as a probe demonstrated that the increased number of florets and grains in a spike was associated with the introgression of an A. cristatum chromosome. Fluorescence in situ hybridization, using a repetitive sequence, pAs1, derived from Aegilops squarrosa L., indicated the replacement of chromosome 6D of wheat in the wheat-A. cristatum chromosome substitution lines. This was confirmed by microsatellite analyses with wheat SSR markers specific for chromosome 6D, suggesting that the A. cristatum chromosome was homoeologous to group 6 and was therefore designated as 6P. This conclvsion was further confirmed by amplification using EST-SSR markers and gliadin analysis. The increased number of florets and kernels within a spike of the wheat-A. cristatum hybrids thus was controlled by gene(s) located on A. cristatum chromosome 6P."

"22268223","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum; Poaceae) is a crop plant of great importance. It provides nearly 20% of the world's daily food supply measured by calorie intake, similar to that provided by rice. The yield of wheat has doubled over the last 40 years due to a combination of advanced agronomic practice and improved germplasm through selective breeding. More recently, yield growth has been less dramatic, and a significant improvement in wheat production will be required if demand from the growing human population is to be met. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing biology and can be applied to address critical issues in plant biology. Technologies can produce draft sequences of genomes with a significant reduction to the cost and timeframe of traditional technologies. In addition, NGS technologies can be used to assess gene structure and expression, and importantly, to identify heritable genome variation underlying important agronomic traits. This review provides an overview of the wheat genome and NGS technologies, details some of the problems in applying NGS technology to wheat, and describes how NGS technologies are starting to impact wheat crop improvement."

It is of great importance to analyze the haplotype variation of Rht-D1, the Green Revolution gene, during wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) domestication and breeding to understand its evolution and function in wheat breeding history. In this study, the Rht-D1 and its flanking regions were sequenced and single nucleotide polymorphisms were detected based on a panel of 45 accessions of Aegilops tauschii, 51 accessions of landraces and 80 accessions of commercial varieties. Genetic diversity in the wild accessions was much higher than that in the varieties and higher than that reported previously. Seven haplotypes (Hapl I to Hapl VII) of Rht-D1 were identified and their evolutionary relationships were proposed. In addition to the well-known Green Revolution allele Rht-D1b, Hapl VII (an allele Rht-D1k) was identified in early breeding varieties, which reduced plant height by 16%. The results suggested that Rht-D1k had been used in breeding before the Green Revolution and made a great contribution to wheat production worldwide. Based on the breeding history and molecular evidence, we proposed that the wheat Green Revolution in China and International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) occurred independently."

"24395439","abstracttext","MicroRNAs are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, taking roles in a variety of fundamental biological processes. Hence, their identification, annotation and characterization are of great significance, especially in bread wheat, one of the main food sources for humans. The recent availability of 5× coverage Triticum aestivum L. whole-genome sequence provided us with the opportunity to perform a systematic prediction of a complete catalogue of wheat microRNAs. Using an in silico homology-based approach, stem-loop coding regions were derived from two assemblies, constructed from wheat 454 reads. To avoid the presence of pseudo-microRNAs in the final data set, transposable element related stem-loops were eliminated by repeat analysis. Overall, 52 putative wheat microRNAs were predicted, including seven, which have not been previously published. Moreover, with distinct analysis of the two different assemblies, both variety and representation of putative microRNA-coding stem-loops were found to be predominant in the intergenic regions. By searching available expressed sequences and small RNA library databases, expression evidence for 39 (out of 52) putative wheat microRNAs was provided. Expression of three of the predicted microRNAs (miR166, miR396 and miR528) was also comparatively quantified with real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. This is the first report on in silico prediction of a whole repertoire of bread wheat microRNAs, supported by the wet-lab validation."

"26399771","abstracttext","Introgression between related species with different ploidy levels has played important roles in wheat subspecies differentiation. Persian wheat, a cultivated tetraploid wheat subspecies (Triticum turgidum subsp. carthlicum), is postulated to have evolved through interploidy hybridization between tetraploid and hexaploid wheats. Here, we report evidence for the origin of subsp. carthlicum based on the discovery of a new allele for the 5th-to-6th exon region of the Wknox1bKNOTTED1-type homeobox gene in a common wheat subspecies (T. aestivum subsp. carthlicoides). In this Wknox1b region, subsp. carthlicoides contains an inverted duplication mutation in the 3' flanking region of a 157-bp MITE insertion site. This structural mutation resulted in the suppression of Wknox1b expression in subsp. carthlicoides, but no structural mutation was observed in the same region of subsp. carthlicum. In addition, the carthlicum allele for the Wknox1b 5th-to-6th exon region exhibited the same sequence as that in the wild emmer wheat subsp. dicoccoides. These observations support an alternative hypothesis that subsp. carthlicum evolved by interploidy hybridization between subsp. carthlicoides and tetraploid wheat."

Herbivore-induced emission of sesquiterpenes can repel pests, and farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPS) is a key enzyme involved in sesquiterpene biosynthesis. However, fps orthologues in wheat and their functional roles in sesquiterpene synthesis and defence against aphid infestation are unknown. Here, two fps isoforms, Tafps1 and Tafps2, were identified in wheat. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and in vitro catalytic activity analyses were conducted to investigate expression patterns and activity. Heterologous expression of these isoforms in Arabidopsis thaliana, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in wheat and aphid behavioural assays were performed to understand the functional roles of these two isoforms. We demonstrated that Tafps1 and Tafps2 played different roles in induced responses to aphid infestation and in sesquiterpene synthesis. Heterologous expression in A. thaliana resulted in repulsion of the peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Wheat plants with these two isoforms transiently silenced were significantly attractive to grain aphid (Sitobion avenae). Our results provide new insights into induced defence against aphid herbivory in wheat, in particular, the different roles of the two Tafps isoforms in both sesquiterpene biosynthesis and defence against aphid infestation."

Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [telomorph = Gibberella zeae (Schwein. Fr.) Petch] is an important disease of bread wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) worldwide. Wheat has limited resistance to FHB controlled by many loci and new sources of resistance are urgently needed. The perennial grass Elymus tsukushiensis thrives in the warm and humid regions of China and Japan and is immune to FHB. Here, we report the transfer and mapping of a major gene Fhb6 from E. tsukushiensis to wheat. Fhb6 was mapped to the subterminal region in the short arm of chromosome 1E(ts)#1S of E. tsukushiensis. Chromosome engineering was used to replace corresponding homoeologous region of chromosome 1AS of wheat with the Fhb6 associated chromatin derived from 1E(ts)#1S of E. tsukushiensis. Fhb6 appears to be new locus for wheat as previous studies have not detected any FHB resistance QTL in this chromosome region. Plant progenies homozygous for Fhb6 had a disease severity rating of 7 % compared to 35 % for the null progenies. Fhb6 has been tagged with molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding and pyramiding of resistance loci for effective control of FHB."

"26588879","abstracttext","Light and abiotic stress both strongly modulate plant growth and development. However, the effect of light-responsive factors on growth and abiotic stress responses in wheat (Triticum aestivum) is unknown. G-box binding factors (GBFs) are blue light-specific components, but their function in abiotic stress responses has not been studied. Here we identified a wheat GBF1 gene that mediated both the blue light- and abiotic stress-responsive signaling pathways. TaGBF1 was inducible by blue light, salt and exposure to abscisic acid (ABA). TaGBF1 interacted with a G-box light-responsive element in vitro and promoted a blue-light response in wheat and Aradidopsis thaliana. Both TaGBF1 over-expression in wheat and its heterologous expression in A. thaliana heighten sensitivity to salinity and ABA, but its knockdown in wheat conferred resistance to high salinity and ABA. The expression of AtABI5, a key component of the ABA signaling pathway in A. thaliana, and its homolog Wabi5 in wheat was increased by transgenic expression of TaGBF1. The hypersensitivity to salt and ABA caused by TaGBF1 was not observed in the abi5 mutant background, showing that ABI5 is the mediator in TaGBF1-induced abiotic stress responses. However, the hypersensitivity to salt conferred by TaGBF1 is not dependent on light. This suggests that TaGBF1 is a common component of blue light- and abiotic stress-responsive signaling pathways."

"27151146","abstracttext","Early establishment of endophytes can play a role in pathogen suppression and improve seedling development. One route for establishment of endophytes in seedlings is transmission of bacteria from the parent plant to the seedling via the seed. In wheat seeds, it is not clear whether this transmission route exists, and the identities and location of bacteria within wheat seeds are unknown. We identified bacteria in the wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. Hereward seed environment using embryo excision to determine the location of the bacterial load. Axenic wheat seedlings obtained with this method were subsequently used to screen a putative endophyte bacterial isolate library for endophytic competency. This absence of bacteria recovered from seeds indicated low bacterial abundance and/or the presence of inhibitors. Diversity of readily culturable bacteria in seeds was low with 8 genera identified, dominated by Erwinia and Paenibacillus. We propose that anatomical restrictions in wheat limit embryo associated vertical transmission, and that bacterial load is carried in the seed coat, crease tissue and endosperm. This finding facilitates the creation of axenic wheat plants to test competency of putative endophytes and also provides a platform for endophyte competition, plant growth, and gene expression studies without an indigenous bacterial background."

N9436B was stable in morphology and cytology, with a chromosome composition of 2n = 42 + 2t = 22II. GISH investigations showed that this line contained two rye chromosomes. GISH, FISH, and molecular maker identification suggested that the introduced R chromosome and the missing wheat chromosome arms were 1R chromosome and 2DL chromosome arm, respectively. N9436B exhibited 30-37 spikelets per spike and a high level of resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) isolate E09 at the seedling stage. N9436B was cytologically stable, had the trait of multiple spikelets, and was resistant to powdery mildew; this line should thus be useful in wheat improvement."

"27325523","abstracttext_key message","By removing the Rf (multi) locus from chromosome 1BS of wheat via chromosome engineering we were able to generate a resource for the production of male sterile wheats in three new cytoplasms. Cytoplasmic male sterility is an essential component in the development of many hybrid crops. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) only the cytoplasm of T. timopheevi cytoplasm has been extensively tested even though many other cytoplasms are also known to produce male sterility. Among them are the cytoplasms of Ae. kotschyi, Ae. uniaristata and Ae. mutica but here male sterility manifests itself only when the 1RS.1BL rye-wheat translocation is present in the nuclear genome. The location of the male fertility restoring gene on the chromosome arm 1BS (Rf (multi) ) has recently been determined using a set of primary recombinants of chromosome arms 1RS with 1BS. Using this knowledge the same recombinants were used to create chromosome arm 1BS in wheat with a small insert from rye that removes the restorer locus. The disomic engineered chromosome 1B1:6 assures male sterility in all three cytoplasms and any standard chromosome 1B in wheat is capable of restoring it. This newly engineered chromosome in combination with the three cytoplasms of Aegilops sp extends the range of possibilities in attempts to create a viable system for hybrid wheat production."

"28801748","abstracttext_main conclusion","The expression of a barley alanine aminotransferase gene impacts agronomic outcomes in a C3 crop, wheat. The use of nitrogen-based fertilizers has become one of the major agronomic inputs in crop production systems. Strategies to enhance nitrogen assimilation and flux in planta are being pursued through the introduction of novel genetic alleles. Here an Agrobacterium-mediated approach was employed to introduce the alanine aminotransferase from barley (Hordeum vulgare), HvAlaAT, into wheat (Triticum aestivum) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), regulated by either constitutive or root preferred promoter elements. Plants harboring the transgenic HvAlaAT alleles displayed increased alanine aminotransferase (alt) activity. The enhanced alt activity impacted height, tillering and significantly boosted vegetative biomass relative to controls in wheat evaluated under hydroponic conditions, where the phenotypic outcome across these parameters varied relative to time of year study was conducted. Constitutive expression of HvAlaAT translated to elevation in wheat grain yield under field conditions. In sorghum, expression of HvAlaAT enhanced enzymatic activity, but no changes in phenotypic outcomes were observed. Taken together these results suggest that positive agronomic outcomes can be achieved through enhanced alt activity in a C3 crop, wheat. However, the variability observed across experiments under greenhouse conditions implies the phenotypic outcomes imparted by the HvAlaAT allele in wheat may be impacted by environment."

"28464281","abstracttext","Small RNAs (sRNAs), an important type of pathogenicity factor, contribute to impairing host immune responses. However, little is known about sRNAs in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), one of the most destructive pathogens of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Here, we report a novel microRNA-like RNA (milRNA) from Pst termed microRNA-like RNA 1 (Pst-milR1), which suppresses wheat defenses during wheat-Pst interactions. We identified Pst-milR1 as a novel milRNA in Pst. Biological prediction and co-transformation showed that Pst-milR1 takes part in cross-kingdom RNA interference (RNAi) events by binding the wheat pathogenesis-related 2 (PR2) gene. Silencing of the Pst-milR1 precursor resulted in increased wheat resistance to the virulent Pst isolate CYR31. PR2 knock-down plants increased the susceptibility of wheat to the avirulent Pst isolate CYR23. This suggests that Pst-milR1 represses the plant immune response by suppressing the expression of PR2. Taking our findings together, we postulate that Pst-milR1 is an important pathogenicity factor in Pst, which acts as an effector to suppress host immunity.

"28502081","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) incurs significant yield losses from powdery mildew, a major fungal disease caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). enhanced disease resistance1 (EDR1) plays a negative role in the defense response against powdery mildew in Arabidopsis thaliana; however, the edr1 mutant does not show constitutively activated defense responses. This makes EDR1 an ideal target for approaches using new genome-editing tools to improve resistance to powdery mildew. We cloned TaEDR1 from hexaploid wheat and found high similarity among the three homoeologs of EDR1. Knock-down of TaEDR1 by virus-induced gene silencing or RNA interference enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, indicating that TaEDR1 negatively regulates powdery mildew resistance in wheat. We used CRISPR/Cas9 technology to generate Taedr1 wheat plants by simultaneous modification of the three homoeologs of wheat EDR1. No off-target mutations were detected in the Taedr1 mutant plants. The Taedr1 plants were resistant to powdery mildew and did not show mildew-induced cell death. Our study represents the successful generation of a potentially valuable trait using genome-editing technology in wheat and provides germplasm for disease resistance breeding."

"27918628","abstracttext","The gaseous phytohormone ethylene plays an important role in spike development in wheat (Triticum aestivum). However, the genotypic variation and the genomic regions governing spike ethylene (SET) production in wheat under long-term heat stress remain unexplored. We investigated genotypic variation in the production of SET and its relationship with spike dry weight (SDW) in 130 diverse wheat elite lines and landraces under heat-stressed field conditions. We employed an Illumina iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping array to identify the genetic loci for SET and SDW through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a subset of the Wheat Association Mapping Initiative (WAMI) panel. The SET and SDW exhibited appreciable genotypic variation among wheat genotypes at the anthesis stage. There was a strong negative correlation between SET and SDW. The GWAS uncovered five and 32 significant SNPs for SET, and 22 and 142 significant SNPs for SDW, in glasshouse and field conditions, respectively. Some of these SNPs closely localized to the SNPs for plant height, suggesting close associations between plant height and spike-related traits. The phenotypic and genetic elucidation of SET and its relationship with SDW supports future efforts toward gene discovery and breeding wheat cultivars with reduced ethylene effects on yield under heat stress."

"30204899","abstracttext","Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt) seriously threatens the production of common wheat (Triticum aestivum). In eukaryotes, WD40-repeat (WDR) proteins usually participate in assembling protein complexes involved in a wide range of cellular processes, including defense responses. However, the potential function of WDR proteins in regulating crop resistance to biotrophic fungal pathogens, such as Bgt, remains unclear. In this study, we isolated TaHOS15, encoding a WDR protein, from the Bgt-susceptible wheat cultivar Jing411 and demonstrated that knockdown of TaHOS15 expression using virus- or transient-induced gene-silencing attenuated wheat susceptibility to Bgt. Biochemical and molecular-biological assays revealed that TaHOS15 interacts with TaHDA6, a wheat homolog of Arabidopsis histone deacetylase AtHDA6, to constitute a transcriptional repressor complex. We determined the role of TaHOS15, which might act as an adaptor protein recruiting TaHDA6 to the chromatin of wheat defense-related genes including TaPR1, TaPR2, TaPR5, and TaWRKY45, where they repress histone acetylation. Reduced TaHOS15 or TaHDA6 transcript levels led to decreased susceptibility to Bgt together with enhanced defense-related transcription under Bgt infection. Collectively, these results demonstrate that TaHOS15 functions in a histone deacetylase complex with TaHDA6 to fine-tune the defense response to Bgt in common wheat."

"30839150","abstracttext","The development and adoption of hybrid seed technology have led to dramatic increases in agricultural productivity. However, it has been a challenge to develop a commercially viable platform for the production of hybrid wheat (Triticum aestivum) seed due to wheat's strong inbreeding habit. Recently, a novel platform for commercial hybrid seed production was described. This hybridization platform utilizes nuclear male sterility to force outcrossing and has been applied to maize and rice. With the recent molecular identification of the wheat male fertility gene Ms1, it is now possible to extend the use of this novel hybridization platform to wheat. In this report, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate heritable, targeted mutations in Ms1. The introduction of biallelic frameshift mutations into Ms1 resulted in complete male sterility in wheat cultivars Fielder and Gladius, and several of the selected male-sterile lines were potentially non-transgenic. Our study demonstrates the utility of the CRISPR/Cas9 system for the rapid generation of male sterility in commercial wheat cultivars. This represents an important step towards capturing heterosis to improve wheat yields, through the production and use of hybrid seed on an industrial scale."

"33297713","abstracttext","Thioredoxins (Trxs) function within the antioxidant network through modulation of the redox reaction(s) involved in oxidative-stress signaling. Given their function in regulating cellular redox, Trx proteins also fulfill key roles in plant immune signaling. Here, TaTrxh1, encoding a subgroup h member of the thioredoxin family, was identified and cloned in wheat (Triticum aestivum), which was rapidly induced by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) invasion and salicylic acid (SA) treatment. Overexpression of TaTrxh1 in tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) induced cell death. Silencing of TaTrxh1 in wheat enhanced susceptibility to Pst in different aspects, including ROS accumulation and pathogen-responsive, or related, gene expression. Herein, we observed that the cellular concentration of SA was significantly reduced in TaTrxh1-silenced plants, indicating that TaTrxh1 possibly regulates wheat resistance to stripe rust through a SA-associated defense signaling pathway. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify TaTrxh1-interacting partners, we further show that interaction with TaCP1 (a RD19-like cysteine protease), and subsequent silencing of TaCP1 reduced wheat resistance to Pst. In total, the data presented herein demonstrate that TaTrxh1 enhances wheat resistance against Pst via SA-dependent resistance signaling and that TaTrxh1 interaction with TaCP1 is required for wheat resistance to stripe rust."

"8058036","abstracttext","Gametocidal (Gc) genes of Aegilops in the background of the wheat genome lead to breakage of wheat chromosomes. The Q gene of wheat was used as a marker to select 19 deletion lines for the long arm of chromosome 5A of common wheat, Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS). The extents of deleted segments were cytologically estimated by the C-banding technique. The DNAs of deletion lines were hybridized with 22 DNA probes recognizing sites on the long arm of the chromosome (5AL) to determine their physical order. Based on the breeding behavior of the deletion lines, the location of a novel gene (Pv, pollen viability) affecting the viability of the male gamete was deduced. The segment translocated from 4AL to 5AL in CS was cytologically estimated to represent 13% of the total length of 5AL. Although DNA markers were almost randomly distributed along the chromosome arm, DNA markers located around the centromere and C-banded regions were obtained only rarely. Some deletion lines were highly rearranged in chromosome structure due to the effect(s) of the Gc gene. Applications of Gc genes for manipulating wheat chromosomes are discussed."

Proteins encoded by these cDNAs are highly similar at the primary sequence level and diverged from the previously reported TaHSP101 (designated TaHSP101A) both in the consensus ATP/GTP-binding region II and in the carboxy terminal region. The HSP101 gene was determined to be a single copy gene or a member of a small gene family in hexaploid wheat. Messages encoding HSP101 proteins were inducible by heat stress treatments in both wheat leaves and roots. Accumulation of the TaHSP101C mRNA was less abundant than that of TaHSP101B mRNA. We are showing for the first time that in addition to heat stress, expression of HSP101 mRNAs in wheat leaves was induced by a 2-h dehydration and a treatment with 5x10(-5)M ABA, but not affected by chilling or wounding, indicating that HSP101 proteins may be involved in both heat and drought responses in wheat."

"25619599","abstracttext","Rates of photosynthesis, tolerance to photooxidative stress, and senescence are all important physiological factors that affect plant development and thus agricultural productivity. GRAS proteins play essential roles in plant growth and development as well as in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. So far few GRAS genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have been characterized. A previous transcriptome analysis indicated that the expression of a GRAS gene (TaSCL14) was induced by high-light stress in Xiaoyan 54 (XY54), a common wheat cultivar with strong tolerance to high-light stress. In this study, TaSCL14 gene was isolated from XY54 and mapped on chromosome 4A. TaSCL14 was expressed in various wheat organs, with high levels in stems and roots. Our results confirmed that TaSCL14 expression was indeed responsive to high-light stress. Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of TaSCL14 in wheat was performed to help characterize its potential functions. Silencing of TaSCL14 resulted in inhibited plant growth, decreased photosynthetic capacity, and reduced tolerance to photooxidative stress. In addition, silencing of TaSCL14 in wheat promoted leaf senescence induced by darkness. These results suggest that TaSCL14 may act as a multifunctional regulator involved in plant growth, photosynthesis, tolerance to photooxidative stress, and senescence."

"27526862","abstracttext","The allohexaploid bread wheat originally derived from three closely related species with A, B and D genome. Although numerous studies were performed to elucidate its origin and phylogeny, no consensus conclusion has reached. In this study, we cloned and sequenced the genes Wcor15-2A, Wcor15-2B and Wcor15-2D in 23 diploid, 10 tetraploid and 106 hexaploid wheat varieties and analyzed their molecular evolution to reveal the origin of the A, B and D genome in Triticum aestivum. Comparative analyses of sequences in diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheats suggest that T. urartu, Ae. speltoides and Ae. tauschii subsp. strangulata are most likely the donors of the Wcor15-2A, Wcor15-2B and Wcor15-2D locus in common wheat, respectively. The Wcor15 genes from subgenomes A and D were very conservative without insertion and deletion of bases during evolution of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid. Non-coding region of Wcor15-2B gene from B genome might mutate during the first polyploidization from Ae. speltoides to tetraploid wheat, however, no change has occurred for this gene during the second allopolyploidization from tetraploid to hexaploid. Comparison of the Wcor15 gene shed light on understanding of the origin of the A, B and D genome of common wheat."

"32480481","abstracttext","Activators of plant defence responses against pathogens are a potential alternative to fungicides, and the well-known resistance inducer salicylic acid (SA) protects wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) against powdery mildew. The aim of our work was to investigate through biochemical and molecular approaches whether lipid metabolism alteration could be considered as a characteristic feature of induced resistance in wheat upon SA infiltration. Expression levels of lox, PI-PLC2 and ltp genes encoding for a lipoxygenase (LOX), a phospholipase C2 and a lipid-transfer protein, respectively, were investigated. Increase of phosphatidic acid (PA) content 48h after SA infiltration in wheat leaves, upregulation of PI-PLC2 gene expression and increased diacylglycerol content were recorded, indicating the involvement of the PLC pathway in the PA synthesis. The wheat octadecanoid pathway was shown to be highly responsive to SA infiltration through simultaneous increases in lox gene expression and LOX activity, as well as a reduction in the content of linolenic acid. Changes in several FA contents and increases of the ltp gene expression were also recorded during the latest hours after SA infiltration. The status of lipid metabolism, as well as the connections between its components as markers of SA-induced resistance in wheat, are discussed."

"30213041","abstracttext","The fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis ( Ptr ) causes tan spot of wheat crops, which is an important disease worldwide. Based on the production of the three known necrotrophic effectors (NEs), the fungal isolates are classified into eight races with race 4 producing no known NEs. From a laboratory cross between 86⁻124 (race 2 carrying the ToxA gene for the production of Ptr ToxA) and DW5 (race 5 carrying the ToxB gene for the production of Ptr ToxB), we have obtained some Ptr isolates lacking both the ToxA and ToxB genes, which, by definition, should be classified as race 4. In this work, we characterized virulence of two of these isolates called B16 and B17 by inoculating them onto various common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and durum ( T . turgidum L.) genotypes. It was found that the two isolates still caused disease on some genotypes of both common and durum wheat. Disease evaluations were also conducted in recombinant inbred line populations derived from two hard red winter wheat cultivars: Harry and Wesley. QTL mapping in this population revealed that three genomic regions were significantly associated with disease, which are different from the three known NE sensitivity loci. This result further indicates the existence of other NE-host sensitivity gene interactions in the wheat tan spot disease system."

"31185680","abstracttext","Terpenoids play important roles in plant defense. Although some terpene synthases have been characterized, terpenoids and their biosynthesis in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) still remain largely unknown. Here, we describe the identification of a terpene synthase gene in wheat. It encodes a sesquiterpene synthase that catalyzes β-patchoulene formation with E,E -farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) as the substrate, thus named as TaPS. TaPS exhibits inducible expression in wheat in response to various elicitations. Particularly, alamethicin treatment strongly induces TaPS gene expression and β-patchoulene accumulation in wheat. Overexpression of TaPS in Arabidopsis successfully produces β-patchoulene, verifying the biochemical function of TaPS in planta. Furthermore, these transgenic Arabidopsis plants exhibit resistance against herbivory by repelling beet armyworm larvae feeding, thereby indicating anti-herbivory activity of β-patchoulene. The catalytic mechanism of TaPS is also explored by homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis. Two key amino acids are identified to act in protonation and stability of intermediates and product formation. Taken together, one wheat sesquiterpene synthase is identified as β-patchoulene synthase. TaPS exhibits inducible gene expression and the sesquiterpene β-patchoulene is involved in repelling insect infestation."

The analysis of a 357 kb sub-sequence of FPC contig ctg11 identified one beta-expansin genes to be TaEXPB11, originally identified as a cDNA from the wheat cv Wyuna. Through the analysis of intron sequences of the three wheat cv. Chinese Spring genes, we propose that two of these beta-expansin genes are duplications of the TaEXPB11 gene. Comparative sequence analysis with two other wheat cultivars (cv. Westonia and cv. Hope) and a Triticum aestivum var. spelta line validated the identification of the Chinese Spring variant of TaEXPB11. The expression in maternal and grain tissues was confirmed by examining EST databases and carrying out RT-PCR experiments. Detailed examination of the position of TaEXPB11 relative to the locus encoding Sr2 disease resistance ruled out the possibility of this gene directly contributing to the resistance phenotype."

The variation established in this gene suggests it is a clearly identifiable member of a gene family and reflects the dynamic features of the wheat genome as it adapted to a range of different environments and uses.

"19005084","articletitle","Genetic and molecular characterization of the VRN2 loci in tetraploid wheat."
"19005084","abstracttext","Winter wheat (Triticum spp.) varieties require long exposures to low temperatures to flower, a process called vernalization. The VRN2 locus includes two completely linked zinc finger-CCT domain genes (ZCCT1 and ZCCT2) that act as flowering repressors down-regulated during vernalization. Deletions or mutations in these two genes result in the elimination of the vernalization requirement in diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum). However, natural allelic variation in these genes has not been described so far in polyploid wheat (tetraploid Triticum turgidum and hexaploid Triticum aestivum). A tetraploid wheat population segregating for both VRN-A2 and VRN-B2 loci facilitated the characterization of different alleles. Comparisons between functional and nonfunctional alleles revealed that both ZCCT1 and ZCCT2 genes are able to confer vernalization requirement and that different ZCCT genes are functional in different genomes. ZCCT1 and ZCCT2 proteins from nonfunctional vrn2 alleles have mutations at arginine amino acids at position 16, 35, or 39 of the CCT domain. These positions are conserved between CCT and HEME ACTIVATOR PROTEIN2 (HAP2) proteins, supporting a model in which the action of CCT domains is mediated by their interactions with HAP2/HAP3/HAP5 complexes. This study also revealed natural variation in gene copy number, including a duplication of the functional ZCCT-B2 gene and deletions or duplications of the complete VRN-B2 locus. Allelic variation at the VRN-B2 locus was associated with a partially dominant effect, which suggests that variation in the number of functional ZCCT genes can be used to expand allelic diversity for heading time in polyploid wheat and, hopefully, improve its adaptation to different environments."

"12748776","abstracttext","A new Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor Say) resistance gene from Aegilops triuncialis and its transfer to hexaploid wheat via interspecific hybridisation is described. The transfer line TR-3531 (42 chromosomes), derived from the cross [(Triticum turgidum x Ae. triuncialis) x Triticum aestivum] and carrying the Heterodera avenae resistance gene Cre7, showed a high level of resistance to the M. destructor biotype prevailing in the SW of Spain. A single dominant gene (H30) seems to determine the Hessian fly resistance in this introgression line, and its linkage with an isozyme marker (Acph-U1) has also been studied. It has been demonstrated that the resistance gene H30 in the TR-3531 line is non-allelic with respect to the genes H3, H6, H9, H11, H12, H13, H18 and H21, present in wheat cultivars from the Uniform Hessian Fly Nursery (UHFN), as well as to H27, carried by the introgression line H-93-33.

Candidate resistance genes were identified in the QTL regions and molecular markers developed for marker-assisted breeding. Two previously known resistance QTL for root lesion nematode (Pratylenchus thornei) in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), QRlnt.sk-6D and QRlnt.sk-2B, were fine-mapped using a Sokoll (moderately resistant) by Krichauff (susceptible) doubled haploid (DH) population and six newly developed recombinant inbred line populations. Bulked segregation analysis with the 90K wheat SNP array identified linked SNPs which were subsequently converted to KASP assays for mapping in the DH and RIL populations. On chromosome 6D, 60 KASP and five SSR markers spanned a total genetic distance of 23.7 cM. QRlnt.sk-6D was delimited to a 3.5 cM interval, representing 1.77 Mbp in the bread wheat cv. Chinese Spring reference genome sequence and 2.29 Mbp in the Aegilops tauschii genome sequence. These intervals contained 42 and 43 gene models in the respective annotated genome sequences. On chromosome 2B, 41 KASP and 5 SSR markers produced a map spanning 19.9 cM. QRlnt.sk-2B was delimited to 1.4 cM, corresponding 3.14 Mbp in the durum wheat cv.

The results of a study of aneuploid derivatives of Chinese Spring indicate that the SKDH isozyme of faster electrophoretic mobility is encoded by a gene, designated Skdh-A1, located in the p (= short) arm of chromosome 5A and that the products of two other genes, designated Skdh-B1 and Skdh-D1, located one each in the p arms of homoeologous chromosomes 5B and 5D, respectively, encode two isozymes of slower and coincident electrophoretic mobility. Additional evidence for this interpretation of the genetic basis of hexaploid wheat SKDH was obtained in studies of the SKDH zymogram phenotypes of various close relatives of hexaploid wheat, including T. monococcum, T. longissimum, T. tauschii, T. turgidum, and T. timopheevii."

"10557229","abstracttext","WPK4, a gene encoding a putative protein kinase, was initially identified in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and shown to be up-regulated by light, nutrient deprivation, and cytokinins. To confirm that WPK4 has protein kinase activity, the protein was produced in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with glutathione S-transferase. The purified protein exhibited autophosphorylation activity and phosphorylated both myelin basic protein and a peptide fragment of rice 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Levels of WPK4 transcripts in wheat seedlings were increased and decreased by the removal and addition of sucrose (Suc), respectively, to the culture medium. The introduction of the N-terminal kinase region of WPK4 into the yeast snf1 mutant cells, which cannot utilize Suc as a carbon source, rescued growth in Suc-containing medium. Cytokinins up-regulated the accumulation of WPK4 transcripts, but their effects were cancelled by the addition of Suc. Our results suggest that Suc negatively regulates the signaling pathway in which transcriptional activation of WPK4 is mediated by cytokinins."

"11709586","abstracttext","Time-courses of the development of freezing tolerance and the expression of a cold-responsive gene wlt10 were monitored during cold acclimation in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Bioassay showed that cold acclimation conferred much higher freezing tolerance on a winter cultivar than a spring cultivar. Northern blot analysis showed that the expression of wlt10 encoding a novel wheat member of a cereal-specific LT-COR protein family was specifically induced by low temperature. A freezing-tolerant winter cultivar accumulated the mRNA more rapidly and for a longer period than a susceptible spring cultivar. The increase in the amount of mRNA was temporary but the peak occurred at the time when the maximum level of freezing tolerance was attained. The mRNA accumulated more in the leaves than in the roots, and different light/dark regimes modulated the level of mRNA accumulation. Genomic Southern blot analyses using the nulli-tetrasomic series showed that the wlt10 homologues were located on the homologous group 2 chromosomes."

"16028116","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important crop and requires long day and short night to flower. To study the molecular mechanism of photoperiodic regulation of flowering in this species, we isolated a wheat TaGI1 gene, an ortholog of GIGANTEA (GI) in Arabidopsis. RNA blot hybridization revealed that TaGI1 is expressed in leaves in a rhythmic manner under long day and short day conditions and its rhythmic expression is regulated by photoperiods and circadian clocks. Further study demonstrated that the TaGI1 rhythmic expression in the leaves of seedlings is initiated by photoperiods, implying that TaGI1 does not show circadian regulation until after being entrained in a light/dark cycle. Interestingly, TaGI1 mRNA was detected in adaxial epidermal cells right above the vascular bundles of leaves, suggesting that the localization of TaGI1 transcripts in leaves may function to regulate flowering in response to photoperiods. Since overexpression of TaGI1 altered flowering time in wild type and complemented the gi mutant in Arabidopsis, it confirmed that TaGI1 is an ortholog of GI in Arabidopsis."

The plants were grown for 15 days in controlled conditions with optimum N supply and then N was depleted from and/or 6-benzylaminopurine was added to the nutrient solution. Both treatments generated an induction of GS1, monitored at the level of gene expression, protein accumulation and enzyme activity, and a decrease in the exudation of amino acids to the phloem, obtained with EDTA technique, which correlated negatively. GS inhibition by metionine sulfoximide (MSX) produced an increase of amino acids exudation and the inhibitor successfully reversed the effect of N deficiency and cytokinin addition over phloem exudation. Our results point to an important physiological role for GS1 in the modulation of amino acids export levels in wheat plants."

"16667254","abstracttext","Mutations (Rht genes) blocking sensitivity to gibberellic acid (GA) were used to examine phytohormone mediated cell wall expansion in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Irreversible extensibility of immature leaf segments, as determined by stress/strain (instron) measurements, declined with Rht gene dose. Exogenous GA(3) significantly increased wall extensibility in the nonmutant controls but had no effect on the near-isogenic GA-insensitive genotypes. Furthermore, ancymidol, an inhibitor of gibberellin biosynthesis, diminished wall extensibility in the nonmutant control. Extensibility of immature segments was highly correlated with mature leaf sheath length (R = +0.95). The results indicate that wall yielding properties of expanding wheat leaves are associated with leaf cell expansion potential and that GA is involved in the determination of those properties."

Previous inheritance studies on Triticum aestivum subsp. spelta cv. album and wheat cultivar Lee showed that each possessed a single dominant gene for stripe rust resistance, i.e., Yr5 and Yr7, respectively. Both were located on the long arm of chromosome 2B, but due to the complexities caused by genetic background effects there was no clear evidence on the allelism or linkage status of these genes. Our study, involving an intercross of Avocet S near-isogenic lines possessing the genes, provided clear evidence for allelism or extremely close linkage of Yr5 and Yr7 based on phenotypic and molecular studies."
"23065204","articletitle","A study of the role of gene TaMYB2 and an associated SNP in dehydration tolerance in common wheat."
"23065204","abstracttext","The myeloblastosis oncogenes (MYB) are one of the important transcription factors that facilitate induction of various developmental and stress responsive genes. They are hence, emerging as key players in improving stress tolerance of plants in response to several abiotic stresses. Therefore, isolation and characterization of these genes, development of transgenics and functional molecular markers for useful alleles is central to various crop improvement programs. In this manuscript, we for the first time are reporting the identification of a synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism associated with dehydration tolerance at 458th bp (an A/G transition) in the TaMYB2 gene of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and development of an allele-specific marker (ASM) for dehydration tolerance for the same. Further we validated this TaMYB2-ASM in a core set of 28 wheat cultivars which can be used for marker-assisted selection for dehydration tolerance in plant breeding programs."
"24202105","articletitle","Partial characterization of the trait for enhanced K(+)-Na (+) discrimination in the D genome of wheat."
"24202105","abstracttext","The long arm of chromosome 4D of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) contains a gene (or genes) which influences the ability of wheat plants to discriminate between Na(+) and K(+). This discrimination most obviously affects transport from the roots to the shoots, in which less Na(+) and more K(+) accumulate in those plants which contain the long arm of chromosome 4D. Concentrations of Na(+) and K(+) in the roots, and Cl(-) concentrations in the roots and shoots, are not significantly affected by this trait, but Na(+), K(+) and Cl(-) contents of the grain are reduced. The trait operates over a wide range of salinities and appears to be constitutive. At the moment it is not possible to determine accurately the effect of this trait on growth or grain yield because the aneuploid lines which are available are much less vigorous and less fertile than their euploid parents."
"24227254","articletitle","Production and cytogenetics of hybrids of Triticum aestivum x Leymus innovatus."
"24227254","abstracttext","Hybrid plants were obtained between Triticum aestivum (2n=6x=42, AABBDD) and Leymus innovatus (2n=4x=28, JJNN) at a frequency varying from 0.4% to 1.2% of the pollinated florets. Improvement of the embryo culture medium resulted in a higher frequency of embryo rescue. Eight of ten hybrids had the expected chromosome number of 35 (ABDJN). Meiotic analysis indicated that there was no homology between the genomes of the two species. Two hybrids had only 28 chromosomes. Comparison of chromosome pairing between the two types of hybrids suggested that Leymus innovatus carries genes that affect chromosome pairing and behavior. The relatively high occurrence of spontaneous doubling in the meiocytes of these hybrids may indicate that backcrossing of the hybrids to wheat should be possible, although frequent chromosome irregularities observed in the meiocytes of the hybrids may decrease the probability of success of this step, which is essential to the process of gene transfer from L. innovatus to wheat."

"26309292","abstracttext","Heat stress exerts significant impact on plant-parasite interactions. Phytohormones, such as salicylic acid (SA), play important roles in plant defense against parasite attacks. Here, we studied the impact of a combination of heat stress and exogenous SA on the resistance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants to the Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)]. We found that the wheat cultivar 'Molly', which contains the resistance gene H13, lost resistance to Hessian fly under heat stress (40°C for 3 and 6 h), and that exogenous application of SA on Molly seedlings right before heat stress can partially prevent the loss of resistance of Molly plants under heat conditions. Our findings have significant implications for understanding the dynamics of plant-insect interactions in the context of heat stress."

"25474652","abstracttext","Tibetan semi-wild wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp. tibetanum Shao) is a semi-wild hexaploid wheat resource that is only naturally distributed in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Brittle rachis and hard threshing are two important characters of Tibetan semi-wild wheat. A whole-genome linkage map of T. aestivum ssp. tibetanum was constructed using a recombinant inbred line population (Q1028×ZM9023) with 186 lines, 564 diversity array technology markers, and 117 simple sequence repeat markers. Phenotypic data on brittle rachis and threshability, as two quantitative traits, were evaluated on the basis of the number of average spike rachis fragments per spike and percent threshability in 2012 and 2013, respectively. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping performed using inclusive composite interval mapping analysis clearly identified four QTLs for brittle rachis and three QTLs for threshability. However, three loci on 2DS, 2DL, and 5AL showed pleiotropism for brittle rachis and threshability; they respectively explained 5.3%, 18.6%, and 18.6% of phenotypic variation for brittle rachis and 17.4%, 13.2%, and 35.2% of phenotypic variation for threshability. A locus on 3DS showed an independent effect on brittle rachis, which explained 38.7% of the phenotypic variation. The loci on 2DS and 3DS probably represented the effect of Tg and Br1, respectively. The locus on 5AL was in very close proximity to the Q gene, but was different from the predicted q in Tibetan semi-wild wheat. To our knowledge, the locus on 2DL has never been reported in common wheat but was prominent in T. aestivum ssp. tibetanum accession Q1028. It remarkably interacted with the locus on 5AL to affect brittle rachis. Several major loci for brittle rachis and threshability were identified in Tibetan semi-wild wheat, improving the understanding of these two characters and suggesting the occurrence of special evolution in Tibetan semi-wild wheat."

"9809439","abstracttext","The Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), an important insect pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., has a gene-for-gene relationship with wheat: single genes in the insect condition avirulence to specific resistance genes in wheat. We report the discovery of the first molecular genetic marker that is tightly linked to a Hessian fly avirulence gene. This dominant DNA polymorphism (OPG15-1) was identified using bulked segregant analysis and arbitrary primers in polymerase chain reactions. Bulked segregant analysis was modified to accommodate the anomalous chromosome cycle of the Hessian fly. It was used to identify DNA polymorphisms linked to the gene (vH6) that confers avirulence to the resistance gene H6 in wheat. OPG15-1 was cloned and sequenced, and a pair of site-specific primers were designed that converted it into a codominant single-stranded conformational polymorphism. Both OPG15-1 and vH6 were shown to be X-linked, and the genetic distance between the two loci was 2.5 +/- 2.5 cM. In situ hybridization to polytene chromosomes of larval salivary glands indicated that OPG15-1 resides near the centromere of Hessian fly chromosome X1."

"11244112","abstracttext","Genes and cDNAs for starch-branching enzyme II (SBEII) have been isolated from libraries constructed from Aegilops tauschii and wheat (Triticum aestivum) endosperm, respectively. One class of genes has been termed wSBEII-DA1 and encodes the N terminus reported for an SBEII from wheat endosperm. On the basis of phylogenetic comparisons with other branching enzyme sequences, wSBEII-DA1 is considered to be a member of the SBEIIa class. The wSBEII-DA1 gene consists of 22 exons with exons 4 to 21 being identical in length to the maize (Zea mays) SBEIIb gene, and the gene is located in the proximal region of the long arm of chromosome 2 at a locus designated sbe2a. RNA encoding SBEIIa can be detected in the endosperm from 6 d after flowering and is at its maximum level from 15 to 18 d after anthesis. Use of antibodies specific for SBEIIa demonstrated that this protein was present in both the soluble and granule bound fractions in developing wheat endosperm. We also report a cDNA sequence for SBEIIa that could arise by variant transcription/splicing. A second gene, termed wSBEII-DB1, was isolated and encodes an SBEII, which shows greater sequence identity with SBEIIb-type sequences than with SBEIIa-type sequences. Comparisons of SBEII gene structures among wheat, maize, and Arabidopsis indicate the lineage of the SBEII genes."

"23192148","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a globally important crop, accounting for 20 per cent of the calories consumed by humans. Major efforts are underway worldwide to increase wheat production by extending genetic diversity and analysing key traits, and genomic resources can accelerate progress. But so far the very large size and polyploid complexity of the bread wheat genome have been substantial barriers to genome analysis. Here we report the sequencing of its large, 17-gigabase-pair, hexaploid genome using 454 pyrosequencing, and comparison of this with the sequences of diploid ancestral and progenitor genomes. We identified between 94,000 and 96,000 genes, and assigned two-thirds to the three component genomes (A, B and D) of hexaploid wheat. High-resolution synteny maps identified many small disruptions to conserved gene order. We show that the hexaploid genome is highly dynamic, with significant loss of gene family members on polyploidization and domestication, and an abundance of gene fragments. Several classes of genes involved in energy harvesting, metabolism and growth are among expanded gene families that could be associated with crop productivity. Our analyses, coupled with the identification of extensive genetic variation, provide a resource for accelerating gene discovery and improving this major crop."

"30535646","abstracttext","A segment of Triticum militinae chromosome 7G harbors a gene(s) conferring powdery mildew resistance which is effective at both the seedling and the adult plant stages when transferred into bread wheat (T. aestivum). The introgressed segment replaces a piece of wheat chromosome arm 4AL. An analysis of segregating materials generated to positionally clone the gene highlighted that in a plant heterozygous for the introgression segment, only limited recombination occurs between the introgressed region and bread wheat 4A. Nevertheless, 75 genetic markers were successfully placed within the region, thereby confining the gene to a 0.012 cM window along the 4AL arm. In a background lacking the Ph1 locus, the localized rate of recombination was raised 33-fold, enabling the reduction in the length of the region containing the resistance gene to a 480 kbp stretch harboring 12 predicted genes. The substituted segment in the reference sequence of bread wheat cv. Chinese Spring is longer (640 kbp) and harbors 16 genes. A comparison of the segments' sequences revealed a high degree of divergence with respect to both their gene content and nucleotide sequence. Of the 12 T. militinae genes, only four have a homolog in cv. Chinese Spring. Possible candidate genes for the resistance have been identified based on function predicted from their sequence."

"23839728","abstracttext","Take-all, caused by soil-borne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), is a devastating root disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Breeding resistant wheat cultivars is the most promising and reliable approach to protect wheat from take-all. Currently, no resistant wheat germplasm is available to breed cultivars using traditional methods. In this study, gene transformation was carried out using Snakin-1 (SN1) gene isolated from potato (Solanum tuberosum) because the peptide shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity in vitro. Purified SN1 peptide also inhibits in vitro the growth of Ggt mycelia. By bombardment-mediated method, the gene SN1 was transformed into Chinese wheat cultivar Yangmai 18 to generate SN1 transgenic wheat lines, which were used to assess the effectiveness of the SN1 peptide in protecting wheat from Ggt. Genomic PCR and Southern blot analyses indicated that the alien gene SN1 was integrated into the genomes of five transgenic wheat lines and heritable from T₀ to T₄ progeny. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses showed that the introduced SN1 gene was transcribed and highly expressed in the five transgenic wheat lines. Following challenging with Ggt, disease test results showed that compared to segregants lacking the transgene and untransformed wheat plants, these five transgenic wheat lines expressing SN1 displayed significantly enhanced resistance to take-all. These results suggest that SN1 may be a potentially transgenic tool for improving the take-all resistance of wheat."

"17028347","abstracttext","Natural hybridization and backcrossing between Aegilops cylindrica and Triticum aestivum can lead to introgression of wheat DNA into the wild species. Hybrids between Ae. cylindrica and wheat lines bearing herbicide resistance (bar), reporter (gus), fungal disease resistance (kp4), and increased insect tolerance (gna) transgenes were produced by pollination of emasculated Ae. cylindrica plants. F1 hybrids were backcrossed to Ae. cylindrica under open-pollination conditions, and first backcrosses were selfed using pollen bags. Female fertility of F1 ranged from 0.03 to 0.6%. Eighteen percent of the sown BC1s germinated and flowered. Chromosome numbers ranged from 30 to 84 and several of the plants bore wheat-specific sequence-characterized amplified regions (SCARs) and the bar gene. Self fertility in two BC1 plants was 0.16 and 5.21%, and the others were completely self-sterile. Among 19 BC1S1 individuals one plant was transgenic, had 43 chromosomes, contained the bar gene, and survived glufosinate treatments. The other BC1S1 plants had between 28 and 31 chromosomes, and several of them carried SCARs specific to wheat A and D genomes. Fertility of these plants was higher under open-pollination conditions than by selfing and did not necessarily correlate with even or euploid chromosome number. Some individuals having supernumerary wheat chromosomes recovered full fertility."

"23574379","abstracttext","Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are cell wall leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins involved in plant defence. The hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, genome AABBDD) genome contains one Pgip gene per genome. Tapgip1 (B genome) and Tapgip2 (D genome) are expressed in all tissues, whereas Tapgip3 (A genome) is inactive because of a long terminal repeat, Copia retrotransposon insertion within the coding region. To verify whether Tapgip1 and Tapgip2 encode active PGIPs and are involved in the wheat defence response, we expressed them transiently and analysed their expression under stress conditions. Neither TaPGIP1 nor TaPGIP2 showed inhibition activity in vitro against fungal polygalacturonases. Moreover, a wheat genotype (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) lacking active homologues of Tapgip1 or Tapgip2 possesses PGIP activity. At transcript level, Tapgip1 and Tapgip2 were both up-regulated after fungal infection and strongly induced following wounding. This latter result has been confirmed in transgenic wheat plants expressing the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene under control of the 5'-flanking region of Tdpgip1, a homologue of Tapgip1 with an identical sequence. Strong and transient GUS staining was mainly restricted to the damaged tissues and was not observed in adjacent tissues. Taken together, these results suggest that Tapgips and their homologues are involved in the wheat defence response by acting at the site of the lesion caused by pathogen infection."

"23535592","abstracttext","About 8,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent, a spontaneous hybridization of the wild diploid grass Aegilops tauschii (2n = 14; DD) with the cultivated tetraploid wheat Triticum turgidum (2n = 4x = 28; AABB) resulted in hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum; 2n = 6x = 42; AABBDD). Wheat has since become a primary staple crop worldwide as a result of its enhanced adaptability to a wide range of climates and improved grain quality for the production of baker's flour. Here we describe sequencing the Ae. tauschii genome and obtaining a roughly 90-fold depth of short reads from libraries with various insert sizes, to gain a better understanding of this genetically complex plant. The assembled scaffolds represented 83.4% of the genome, of which 65.9% comprised transposable elements. We generated comprehensive RNA-Seq data and used it to identify 43,150 protein-coding genes, of which 30,697 (71.1%) were uniquely anchored to chromosomes with an integrated high-density genetic map. Whole-genome analysis revealed gene family expansion in Ae. tauschii of agronomically relevant gene families that were associated with disease resistance, abiotic stress tolerance and grain quality. This draft genome sequence provides insight into the environmental adaptation of bread wheat and can aid in defining the large and complicated genomes of wheat species."

"25078249","abstracttext","As one of the three key components of the 'Green Revolution', photoperiod insensitivity is vital for improved adaptation of wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars to a wider geographical range. Photoperiod-B1a (Ppd-B1a) is one of the major genes that confers photoperiod insensitivity in 'Green Revolution' varieties, and has made a significant contribution to wheat yield improvement. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the photoperiod insensitivity of Ppd-B1a alleles from an epigenetic perspective using a combination of bisulfite genomic sequencing, orthologous comparative analysis, association analysis, linkage analysis and gene expression analysis. Based on the study of a large collection of wheat germplasm, we report two methylation haplotypes of Ppd-B1 and demonstrate that the higher methylation haplotype (haplotype a) was associated with increased copy numbers and higher expression levels of the Ppd-B1 gene, earlier heading and photoperiod insensitivity. Furthermore, assessment of the distribution frequency of the different methylation haplotypes suggested that the methylation patterns have undergone selection during the wheat breeding process. Our study suggests that DNA methylation in the regulatory region of the Ppd-B1 alleles, which is closely related to copy number variation, plays a significant role in wheat breeding, to confer photoperiod insensitivity and better adaptation to a wider geographical range."

"24913625","abstracttext","NPF (formerly referred to as low-affinity NRT1) and 'high-affinity' NRT2 nitrate transporter genes are involved in nitrate uptake by the root, and transport and distribution of nitrate within the plant. The NPF gene family consists of 53 members in Arabidopsis thaliana, however only 11 of these have been functionally characterized. Although homologous genes have been identified in genomes of different plant species including some cereals, there is little information available for wheat (Triticum aestivum). Sixteen genes were identified in wheat homologous to characterized Arabidopsis low-affinity nitrate transporter NPF genes, suggesting a complex wheat NPF gene family. The regulation of wheat NFP genes by plant N-status indicated involvement of these transporters in substrate transport in relation to N-metabolism. The complex expression pattern in relation to tissue specificity, nitrate availability and senescence may be associated with the complex growth patterns of wheat depending on sink/source demands, as well as remobilization during grain filling."
"27137382","articletitle","Homeotic Genes and the ABCDE Model for Floral Organ Formation in Wheat."
"27137382","abstracttext","Floral organ formation has been the subject of intensive study for over 20 years, particularly in the model dicot species Arabidopsis thaliana. These studies have led to the establishment of a general model for the development of floral organs in higher plants, the so-called ABCDE model, in which floral whorl-specific combinations of class A, B, C, D, or E genes specify floral organ identity. In Arabidopsis, class A, B, C, D, E genes encode MADS-box transcription factors except for the class A gene APETALA2. Mutation of these genes induces floral organ homeosis. In this review, I focus on the roles of these homeotic genes in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), particularly with respect to the ABCDE model. Pistillody, the homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures, occurs in cytoplasmic substitution (alloplasmic) wheat lines that have the cytoplasm of the related wild species Aegilops crassa. This phenomenon is a valuable tool for analysis of the wheat ABCDE model. Using an alloplasmic line, the wheat ortholog of DROOPING LEAF (TaDL), a member of the YABBY gene family, has been shown to regulate pistil specification. Here, I describe the current understanding of the ABCDE model for floral organ formation in wheat."

"28407081","abstracttext","The Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia Kurdjumov) is an economically important pest of small grains in many countries. The past decades have seen the deployment of resistance-carrying wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to control D. noxia. However, the emergence of resistance-breaking biotypes is negating this strategy. The role that noncoding RNA (ncRNA) molecules play in the wheat-D. noxia interaction has not been studied to date. This study aimed to isolate differentially regulated microRNA from a resistant and susceptible near-isogenic wheat line after aphid infestation. Twenty-seven identified miRNA were mostly related to stress-linked miRNA, and their predicted targets were linked with known D. noxia-feeding regulated proteins. These included transcription factors, signaling proteins, carbohydrate metabolism, and disease resistance pathways. Gene expression of three putative miRNAs and a predicted nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat gene with an identified miRNA target site in the NB-ARC domain displayed differential regulation between the resistant and susceptible plants. This study marks the initial investigation into understanding the role of ncRNA in a D. noxia-resistant wheat line after infestation and reports a correlation between a miRNA and its putative target for this interaction."

"29193541","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) has low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). The genetic mechanisms controlling NUE are unknown. Positional cloning of a major quantitative trait locus for N-related agronomic traits showed that the vernalization gene TaVRN-A1 was tightly linked with TaNUE1, the gene shown to influence NUE in wheat. Because of an Ala 180 /Val 180 substitution, TaVRN-A1a and TaVRN-A1b proteins interact differentially with TaANR1, a protein encoded by a wheat orthologue of Arabidopsis nitrate regulated 1 (ANR1). The transcripts of both TaVRN-A1 and TaANR1 were down-regulated by nitrogen. TaANR1 was functionally characterized in TaANR1::RNAi transgenic wheat, and in a natural mutant with a 23-bp deletion including 10-bp at the 5' end of intron 5 and 13-bp of exon 6 in gDNA sequence in its gDNA sequence, which produced transcript that lacked the full 84-bp exon 6. Both TaANR1 and TaHOX1 bound to the Ala 180 /Val 180 position of TaVRN-A1. Genetically incorporating favourable alleles from TaVRN-A1, TaANR1 and TaHOX1 increased grain yield from 9.84% to 11.58% in the field. Molecular markers for allelic variation of the genes that regulate nitrogen can be used in breeding programmes aimed at improving NUE and yield in novel wheat cultivars."

"30696748","abstracttext","Celiac disease is the most common food-induced enteropathy in humans, with a prevalence of approximately 1% worldwide. It is induced by digestion-resistant, proline- and glutamine-rich seed storage proteins, collectively referred to as gluten, found in wheat ( Triticum aestivum ). Related prolamins are present in barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) and rye ( Secale cereale ). The incidence of both celiac disease and a related condition called nonceliac gluten sensitivity is increasing. This has prompted efforts to identify methods of lowering gluten in wheat, one of the most important cereal crops. Here, we used bulked segregant RNA sequencing and map-based cloning to identify the genetic lesion underlying a recessive, low-prolamin mutation ( lys3a ) in diploid barley. We confirmed the mutant identity by complementing the lys3a mutant with a transgenic copy of the wild-type barley gene and then used targeting-induced local lesions in genomes to identify induced single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the three homeologs of the corresponding wheat gene. Combining inactivating mutations in the three subgenomes of hexaploid bread wheat in a single wheat line lowered gliadin and low-molecular-weight glutenin accumulation by 50% to 60% and increased free and protein-bound lysine by 33%."

It indicates that nitrogen deficiency altered the phenotype of wheat plants. Furthermore, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the phenotype, transcriptome, GO pathways, and KEGG pathways of DEGs identified in wheat grown under NDC. It showed up-regulation of Exp (24), and Nrt (9) gene family members, which increased the nitrogen absorption and down-regulation of Pet (3), Psb (8), Nar (3), and Nir (1) gene family members hampered photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism."

"33288007","abstracttext","Mannan is a class of cell wall polysaccharides widespread in the plant kingdom. Mannan structure and properties vary according to species and organ. The cell walls of cereal grains have been extensively studied due to their role in cereal processing and to their beneficial effect on human health as dietary fiber. Recently, we showed that mannan in wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain endosperm has a linear structure of β-1,4-linked mannose residues. The aim of this work was to study the biosynthesis and function of wheat grain mannan. We showed that mannan is deposited in the endosperm early during grain development, and we identified candidate mannan biosynthetic genes expressed in the endosperm. The functional study in wheat was unsuccessful therefore our best candidate genes were expressed in heterologous systems. The endosperm-specificTaCslA12 gene expressed in Pichia pastoris and in an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant depleted in glucomannan led to the production of wheat-like linear mannan lacking glucose residues and with moderate acetylation. Therefore, this gene encodes a mannan synthase and is likely responsible for the synthesis of wheat endosperm mannan."
"31535163","articletitle","Production of a complete set of wheat-barley group-7 chromosome recombinants with increased grain β-glucan content."
"31535163","abstracttext_key message","Wheat-barley group-7 recombinant chromosomes were selected using molecular cytogenetics and SNP markers; increased grain β-glucan content was observed in wheat plants with two and four copies of HvCslF6. The soluble dietary fiber (1-3)(1-4) mixed linked β-D-glucan from cereal grains is a valuable component of a healthy diet, which reduces risks of coronary disease and diabetes. Although wheat is an important cereal crop providing a substantial portion of daily calories and protein intake in the human diet, it has a low level of β-glucan. Owing to the plasticity of the polyploid wheat genome, agronomically important traits absent in the wheat primary gene pool can be introgressed from distant relatives. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) has a high grain β-glucan content. Earlier, we introgressed this trait into wheat in the form of whole arm compensating Robertsonian translocations (RobT) involving group-7 chromosomes of barley and all three sub-genomes of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L). In the presented research, we shortened the barley 7HL arms in these RobTs to small pericentromeric segments, using induced wheat-barley homoeologous recombination. The recombinants were selected using SNP markers and molecular cytogenetics. Plants, comprising barley cellulose synthase-like F6 gene (HvCslF6), responsible for β-glucan synthesis, had a higher grain β-glucan content than the wheat control. Three wheat-barley group-7 recombinant chromosomes involving the A, B and D sub-genomes laid the basis for a multiple-copy gene introgression to hexaploid wheat. It is hypothesized that further increases in the β-glucan content in wheat grain can be obtained by increasing the number of HvCslF6 copies through combining several recombinant chromosomes in one line. The wheat lines with four copies of HvCslF6 exceeded the β-glucan content of the lines with two copies."

"25597920","abstracttext_background","Fusarium graminearum, one of the causal agents of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB, scab), leads to severe losses in grain yield and quality due to the production of mycotoxins which are harmful to human and livestock. Different traits for FHB resistance in wheat were identified for common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) while the sources of FHB resistance in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. Durum), one of the cereals most susceptible to F. graminearum infection, have not been found. New lines of evidence indicate that content and composition of cell wall polymers affect the susceptibility of the wall to degrading enzymes produced by pathogens during infection and can play a role in the outcome of host-pathogen interactions. The objective of our research is to identify potential cell wall biochemical traits linked to Fusariosis resistance to be transferred from a resistant common wheat to a susceptible durum wheat line."

Significant differences in lignin monolignols composition, arabinoxylan (AX) substitutions and pectin methylesterification were found between resistant and susceptible plants. We isolated and characterized a pectin methylesterase gene WheatPME1, which we found being down regulated in the FHB-resistant line and induced by fungal infection in the susceptible wheat."

"15891901","abstracttext","Phytochromes are a family of red/far-red light perceiving photoreceptors. The monocot phytochrome family is represented by three members, PHYA, PHYB and PHYC. We have isolated and characterized the first PHY gene member (TaPHYC) from common wheat, Triticum aestivum var. CPAN1676. It codes for a species of the photoreceptor, phyC, which is known to be light-stable in all plants analyzed so far. A sequence of 7.2 kb has been determined, which includes 3.42 kb of coding region. This is the second full-length PHYC gene sequenced from a monocot (first was from rice). TaPHYC gene shares structural similarities with the rice PHYC containing four exons and three introns in the coding region. The 5' UTR is 1.0-kb-long and harbors an upstream open reading frame (URF) encoding 28 aa. Southern blot analysis of TaPHYC indicates that it represents single locus in the wheat genome, although the possibility of additional loci cannot be completely ruled out. Chromosomal localization using nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of Triticum aestivum var. Chinese Spring places TaPHYC on chromosome 4B. PHYC represents a constitutively expressed gene in all the organs tested and under light/dark conditions. However, PHYC was found to be developmentally regulated showing maximal expression in 3-day-old dark-grown seedlings, which declined thereafter. In silico analysis has also been done to compare TaPHYC gene with the partial sequences known from other wheat species and cultivars. The presence of a topoisomerase gene immediately downstream of the PHYC gene, both in rice and wheat genomes, presents yet another example of synteny in cereals and its possible significance has been discussed."
"18470124","articletitle","Resistance to wheat leaf rust and stem rust in Triticum tauschii and inheritance in hexaploid wheat of resistance transferred from T. tauschii."
"18470124","abstracttext","Twelve accessions of Triticum tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. were genetically analyzed for resistance to leaf rust (Puccinia recondita Rob. ex Desm.) and stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f.sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn.) of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four genes conferring seedling resistance to leaf rust, one gene conferring seedling resistance to stem rust, and one gene conferring adult-plant resistance to stem rust were identified. These genes were genetically distinct from genes previously transferred to common wheat from T. tauschii and conferred resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogen races. Two of the four seedling leaf rust resistance genes were not expressed in synthetic hexaploids, produced by combining tetraploid wheat with the resistant T. tauschii accessions, probably owing to the action of one or more intergenomic suppressor loci on the A or B genome. The other two seedling leaf rust resistance genes were expressed at the hexaploid level as effectively as in the source diploids. One gene was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2D more than 50 cM from the centromere and the other was mapped to chromosome 5D. Suppression of seedling resistance to leaf rust in synthetic hexaploids derived from three accessions of T. tauschii allowed the detection of three different genes conferring adult-plant resistance to a broad spectrum of leaf rust races. The gene for seedling resistance to stem rust was mapped to chromosome ID. The degree of expression of this gene at the hexaploid level was dependent on the genetic background in which it occurred and on environmental conditions. The expression of the adult-plant gene for resistance to stem rust was slightly diminished in hexaploids. The production of synthetic hexaploids was determined to be the most efficient and flexible method for transferring genes from T. tauschii to T. aestivum, but crossing success was determined by the genotypes of both parents. Although more laborious, the direct introgression method of crossing hexaploid wheat with T. tauschii has the advantages of enabling selection for maximum expression of resistance in the background hexaploid genotype and gene transfer into an agronomically superior cultivar."

"25130909","abstracttext","Abiotic stress including drought and salinity affects quality and yield of wheat varieties used for the production of both bread and pasta flour. bZIP, MBF1, WRKY, MYB and NAC transcription factor (TF) genes are the largest transcriptional regulators which are involved in growth, development, physiological processes, and biotic/abiotic stress responses in plants. Identification of expression profiling of these TFs plays a crucial role to understand the response of different wheat species against severe environmental changes. In the current study, expression analysis of TaWLIP19 (wheat version of bZIP), TaMBF1, TaWRKY10, TaMYB33 and TaNAC69 genes was examined under drought and salinity stress conditions in Triticum aestivum cv. (Yuregir-89), Triticum turgidum cv. (Kiziltan-91), and Triticum monococcum (Siyez). After drought stress application, all five selected genes in Kiziltan-91 were induced. However, TaMBF1 and TaWLIP19 were the only downregulated genes in Yuregir-89 and Siyez, respectively. Except TaMYB33 in Siyez, expression level of the remaining genes increased under salt stress condition in all Triticum species. For determination of drought response to selected TF members, publicly available RNA-seq data were also analyzed in this study. TaMBF1, TaWLIP19 and TaNAC69 transcripts were detected through in silico analysis. This comprehensive gene expression analysis provides valuable information for understanding the roles of these TFs under abiotic stresses in modern wheat cultivars and ancient einkorn wheat. In addition, selected TFs might be used for determination of drought or salinity-tolerant and susceptible cultivars for molecular breeding studies."

"31099397","abstracttext","Brassinosteroid (BR) plays an important role in plant development and biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, but its specific function remains largely unknown in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), preventing its utilization in this important crop. In this study, the function of BR and its underlying cytological role in wheat root development were comprehensively investigated. Our findings demonstrated that BR has a conserved function in regulating root length in wheat, and novel roles in regulating lateral root emergence and root diameter were uncovered. Analyses of BR homologous gene composition and evolutionary divergence demonstrated that the genetic framework of the wheat BR pathway was close to that of rice, but contained highly redundant homologous copies of genes from the subgenome A, B and D. These homologous copies showed active expression and shared a conserved BR response. The expression of wheat DWF4 and glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) genes in Arabidopsis confirmed that multiple homologous copies maintained their conserved function in regulating root development, highlighting their redundant status and indicating that a special challenge exists in wheat gene modification to deal with this high redundancy. However, our results suggested that the hypermorphic effect of T. aestivum GSK (TaGSK) genes with point mutations may be an effective approach to overcome this redundancy in the manipulation of BR signaling in wheat. Our study provides fundamental data uncovering the function of BR in wheat root development, the underlying genetic basis and a possible strategy to manipulate BR signaling in hexaploid wheat."
"3017812","articletitle","Structure of wheat gamma-gliadin genes."
"3017812","abstracttext","We have cloned and sequenced two linked members of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) gliadin multigene family. One gene encodes a gamma-gliadin which is 292 amino acids (aa) long. S1 mapping indicates that this gene is transcriptionally active. The second gene, which is only marginally active by S1 mapping, is closely related to the first gene. Moreover, it is probably incapable of encoding a full-length gamma-gliadin due to the presence of two premature in-frame stop codons. Neither gene contains introns. Nucleotide sequences of the two genes show the presence of characteristic repeats which have a derived aa consensus sequence Pro-Gln-Gln-Pro-Gln-Gln-Pro-Phe-Pro-Gln. A comparison of the promoter regions of these gamma-gliadin genes with those of the alpha-gliadin genes shows the presence of a highly conserved region that could be involved in tissue specific and developmental regulation."

"9096359","abstracttext","In the progeny of the monosomic addition line of common wheat, Triticum aestivum, carrying the gametocidal chromosome of Aegilops cylindrica, deletion chromosomes carrying the break point within the nucleolar organizing region of chromosome 1B appeared. Attempts were made to amplify the break points by PCR using primers of telomere and rDNA (rRNA gene). In one deletion line, specific amplification of DNA fragments including the 18S rRNA gene, telomere repeats, and their junction occurred. At the junction of telomere and rRNA gene there was a 31-bp inverted duplication of the rRNA gene. Telomere sequences were initiated from the sequence TAG in the duplication. Between the duplications a small sequence was also inserted. This novel DNA sequence at the break point indicates that the breakage-fusion-bridge cycle(s) took place after the first chromatin breakage by the gametocidal gene."

The chromatograms had 27 spots identified as flavonoids and six representing phenolic acids. Some of the areas were complex and contained more than one compound. Four flavonoids were identified as under the control of gene(s) on chromosome arms 1DS, 4DL, 5AS and 6BS. A phenolic glycoside was concluded to be controlled by a gene(s) on chromosome arm 7BL. Gene(s) on chromosome arm 4DL affected the amount of compounds in two other spots, and gene(s) on chromosome arm 4BS reduced the level of all flavonoid compounds. The individual compounds in some of the complex spots may be under the control of gene(s) on homoeologous chromosomes."

"21993814","abstracttext","On the basis of the results of gene chip analysis of the salt-tolerant wheat mutant RH8706-49 under conditions of salt stress, we identified and cloned an unknown salt-induced gene TaST (Triticum aestivum salt-tolerant). Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that the expression of the gene was induced by salt stress. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the TaST gene showed higher salt tolerance than the wild-type controls. Subcellular localization studies revealed that the protein encoded by this gene was in the nucleus. In comparison with wild-type controls, transgenic Arabidopsis plants accumulated more Ca(2+), soluble sugar, and proline and less Na(+) under salt stress. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaST also showed increased expression of many stress-related genes. All these findings indicated that TaST can enhance the salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants."

"19562512","abstracttext","The promoter of a pollen-specific gene TaPSG719 was isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by inverse-PCR (IPCR). Sequence analysis revealed that the promoter contains two cis-acting elements (AGAAA and GTGA) known to confer anther/pollen-specific gene expression which suggests that the promoter of TaPSG719 gene is a pollen-specific one. To ascertain the regulatory function of TaPSG719 promoter, two deleted fragments (-1,776 to -1 bp and -1,019 to -1 bp) were fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene and transformed into tobacco plants. Similar GUS expression patterns were observed in all transformed plants and its activity was detected exclusively in pollen. No GUS activity in any other floral or vegetative tissue was observed. The results confirm that TaPSG719 promoter is pollen-specific and active during the middle stages of pollen development till anther matured, and it can drive pollen-specific gene expression across the species."

"27288366","abstracttext","Ancient duplication events and a high rate of retention of extant pairs of duplicate genes have contributed to an abundance of duplicate genes in plant genomes. These duplicates have contributed to the evolution of novel functions, such as the production of floral structures, induction of disease resistance, and adaptation to stress. Additionally, recent whole-genome duplications that have occurred in the lineages of several domesticated crop species, including wheat (Triticum aestivum), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and soybean (Glycine max), have contributed to important agronomic traits, such as grain quality, fruit shape, and flowering time. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms and impacts of gene duplication will be important to future studies of plants in general and of agronomically important crops in particular. In this review, we survey the current knowledge about gene duplication, including gene duplication mechanisms, the potential fates of duplicate genes, models explaining duplicate gene retention, the properties that distinguish duplicate from singleton genes, and the evolutionary impact of gene duplication."

"7498776","abstracttext","The nucleolus organizing regions (NORs) on the short arms of chromosomes 1A(m) and 5A(m) of diploid wheat, Triticum monococcum L., are at the most distal loci in the linkage maps of these two chromosome arms. This distal location differs from the interstitial location of the Nor loci on chromosome arms 1BS of tetraploid Triticum turgidum L. and hexaploid T. aestivum L., 5DS of T. aestivum and diploid Ae. tauschii Coss., and 5HS of barley. Moreover, the barley 5HS locus is at a different location than the 5DS locus. However, other markers, including the centromeres, are colinear. These findings showed that the major Nor loci have repeatedly changed position in the chromosome arms during the radiation of species in the tribe Triticeae without rearrangements of the linkage groups. It is suggested that Nor loci may change position via dispersion of minor loci, that are shown here to exist in the T. monococcum genome, magnification of gene copy numbers in these minor loci, and subsequent deletion of the original major loci. Implications of these findings for the use of rRNA nucleotide sequences in phylogenetic reconstructions are pointed out."

Transfer line H-93-33, which has 42 chromosomes and has been derived from the cross (Triticum turgidum x Ae. ventricosa) x T. aestivum, carries genes encoding all three biochemical markers. Linkage between these genes has been demonstrated by analysis of individual kernels of the F2 (H-93-33 x T. aestivum cv. ""Almatense"" H-10-15). A study of the hybrids of line H-93-33 with T. aestivum H-10-15 and with the 4DS ditelosomic line has confirmed that, as suspected, the linkage group corresponds to chromosome 4M(v) from Ae. ventricosa. Additionally, it has been found that the previously reported resistance of line H-93-33 to powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis) is also linked to the biochemical markers; this indicates that either the gene responsible for it is different from that in lines H-93-8 and H-93-35, or that a translocation between two different M(v) chromosomes has occurred in line H-93-33."

NC96BGTA5 is a germ plasm line with the pedigree Saluda x 3/PI427662. The response patterns for powdery mildew resistance in NC96BGTA5 were tested with 30 differential isolates of B. graminis f. sp. tritici, and the line was resistant to all tested isolates. The analyses of P(1), P(2), F(1), F(2), and BC(1)F(1) populations derived from NC96BGTA5 revealed two genes for wheat powdery mildew resistance in the NC96BGTA5 line. One gene, Pm3a, was from its recurrent parent Saluda, and the second was a new gene introgressed from wild einkorn wheat. The gene was determined to be different from Pm1 to Pm21 by gene-for-gene and pedigree analyses. The new gene was identified as linked to the Pm3a gene based on the F(2) and BC(1)F(1) populations derived from a cross between NC96BGTA5 and a susceptible cultivar NK-Coker 68-15, and the data indicated that the gene was located on chromosome 1A. It is proposed that this new gene be designated Pm25 for wheat powdery mildew resistance in NC96BGTA5. Three random amplified polymorphic DNA markers, OPX06(1050), OPAG04(950), and OPAI14(600), were found to be linked to this new gene."

The endosperm-specific wheat basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) factor storage protein activator (SPA) is a positive regulator that binds to the promoter of a prolamin gene. The aim of this study was to map SPA (the gene encoding bZIP factor SPA) and genomic regions associated with quantitative variations of storage protein fractions using F7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Triticum aestivum ""Renan"" and T. aestivum ""Récital"". SPA was mapped through RFLP using a cDNA probe and a specific single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker. Storage protein fractions in the parents and RILs were quantified using capillary electrophoresis. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for protein were detected and mapped on six chromosome regions. One QTL, located on the long arm of chromosome 1B, explained 70% of the variation in quantity of the x subunit of Glu-B1. Genetic mapping suggested that SPA is located on chromosome arm 1L and is also present in the confidence interval of the corresponding QTL for Glu-B1x on 1BL, suggesting that SPA might be a candidate gene for this QTL."

"22066205","abstracttext","Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) was recorded for the first time in South Africa in 1978. In 2005, a second biotype, RWASA2, emerged, and here we report on the emergence of yet another biotype, found for the first time in 2009. The discovery of new Russian wheat aphid biotypes is a significant challenge to the wheat, Triticum aestivum L., industry in South Africa. Russian wheat aphid resistance in wheat, that offered wheat producers a long-term solution to Russian wheat aphid control, may no longer be effective in areas where the new biotypes occur. It is therefore critical to determine the diversity and extent of distribution of biotypes in South Africa to successfully deploy Russian wheat aphid resistance in wheat. Screening of 96 Russian wheat aphid clones resulted in identification of three Russian wheat aphid biotypes. Infestations of RWASA1 caused susceptible damage symptoms only in wheat entries containing the Dn3 gene. Infestations of RWASA2 caused susceptible damage symptoms in wheat entries containing Dn1, Dn2, Dn3, and Dn9 resistant genes. Based on the damage-rating scores for the seven resistance sources, a new biotype, which caused damage rating scores different from those for RWASA1 and RWASA2, was evident among the Russian wheat aphid populations tested. This new biotype is virulent to the same resistance sources as RWASA2 (Dn1, Dn2, Dn3, and Dn9), but it also has added virulence to Dn4, whereas RWASA2 is avirulent to this resistance source."

"12369621","abstracttext","A family of three cDNAs, designated TaSUT1A, 1B and 1D, encoding sucrose transporter (SUT) proteins was isolated from a hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) endosperm library. The cDNA sequences are 96% identical but are distinguishable from one another by virtue of a size polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). The predicted amino acid sequences are 98% identical and are highly similar to the sucrose transporters from rice, maize and barley. A gene for TaSUT1 was isolated from genomic libraries of Aegilops tauschii (the donor of the D genome of wheat) and the coding sequence found to be identical to that of TaSUT1D cDNA. There is only one copy of each TaSUT1 gene in hexaploid wheat and it is located on chromosome 4. Genomic Southern analysis and PCR analysis across the 3' polymorphic region of hexaploid, tetraploid and progenitor diploid wheat DNAs established that the TaSUT1A gene was present in the putative A-genome progenitor, T. monococcum, and that the TaSUT1B gene was present in the putative B-genome progenitor, T. searsii. All three TaSUT1 genes are expressed at high levels in filling grain, showing a good correlation with the developmental time course of growth. This reinforces the view that in cereals a major role of SUT1 is in the post-phloem sugar transport pathway associated with seed filling."

"22001910","abstracttext","Complex Triticeae genomes pose a challenge to genome sequencing efforts due to their size and repetitive nature. Genome sequencing can reveal details of conservation and rearrangements between related genomes. We have applied Illumina second generation sequencing technology to sequence and assemble the low copy and unique regions of Triticum aestivum chromosome arm 7BS, followed by the construction of a syntenic build based on gene order in Brachypodium. We have delimited the position of a previously reported translocation between 7BS and 4AL with a resolution of one or a few genes and report approximately 13% genes from 7BS having been translocated to 4AL. An additional 13 genes are found on 7BS which appear to have originated from 4AL. The gene content of the 7DS and 7BS syntenic builds indicate a total of ~77,000 genes in wheat. Within wheat syntenic regions, 7BS and 7DS share 740 genes and a common gene conservation rate of ~39% of the genes from the corresponding regions in Brachypodium, as well as a common rate of colinearity with Brachypodium of ~60%. Comparison of wheat homoeologues revealed ~84% of genes previously identified in 7DS have a homoeologue on 7BS or 4AL. The conservation rates we have identified among wheat homoeologues and with Brachypodium provide a benchmark of homoeologous gene conservation levels for future comparative genomic analysis.

Drought model was simulated by exposing the roots of wheat to polyethylene glycol-6000 (PEG-6000) solution (150 g L(-1)) for 4 days and the growth of wheat treated with PEG was significantly decreased. However, after AOS application, seedling and root length, fresh weight and relative water content of wheat were increased by 18%, 26%, 43% and 33% under dehydration status compared with that of PEG group, respectively. Moreover, the antioxidative enzymes activities were obviously enhanced and malondialdehyde (MDA) content was reduced by 37.9% in samples treated by AOS. Additionally, the drought resistant related genes involved in ABA signal pathway, such as late embryogenesis abundant protein 1 gene (LEA1), psbA gene, Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 gene (SnRK2) and Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Synthetase gene (P5CS) were up-regulated by AOS.

However, the current wheat sequence knowledge is not complete. The aim of our study is to provide different and complementary set of data for chromosome 4D. A survey sequence was obtained by pyrosequencing of flow-sorted 4DS (7.2×) and 4DL (4.1×) arms. Single ends (SE) and long mate pairs (LMP) reads were assembled into contigs (223Mb) and scaffolds (65Mb) that were aligned to Aegilops tauschii draft genome (DD), anchoring 34Mb to chromosome 4. Scaffolds annotation rendered 822 gene models. A virtual gene order comprising 1973 wheat orthologous gene loci and 381 wheat gene models was built. This order was largely consistent with the scaffold order determined based on a published high density map from the Ae. tauschii chromosome 4, using bin-mapped 4D ESTs as a common reference. The virtual order showed a higher collinearity with homeologous 4B compared to 4A. Additionally, a virtual map was constructed and ∼5700 genes (∼2200 on 4DS and ∼3500 on 4DL) predicted. The sequence and virtual order obtained here using the 454 platform were compared with the Illumina one used by the IWGSC, giving complementary information."
"26924849","articletitle","Induced mutations in the starch branching enzyme II ( SBEII ) genes increase amylose and resistant starch content in durum wheat."
"26924849","abstracttext","Starch is the largest component of the wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) grain and consists of approximately 70-80% amylopectin and 20-30% amylose. Amylopectin is a highly-branched, readily digested polysaccharide, whereas amylose has few branches and forms complexes that resist digestion and mimic dietary fiber (resistant starch). Down-regulation of the starch branching enzyme II ( SBEII ) gene by RNA interference (RNAi) was previously shown to increase amylose content in both hexaploid and tetraploid wheat. We generated ethyl methane sulphonate (EMS) mutants for the SBEIIa -A and SBEIIa -B homoeologs in the tetraploid durum wheat variety Kronos ( T. turgidum ssp. durum L.). Single-gene mutants showed non-significant increases in amylose and resistant starch content, but a double mutant combining a SBEIIa -A knock-out mutation with a SBEIIa -B splice-site mutation showed a 22% increase in amylose content ( P <0.0001) and a 115% increase in resistant starch content ( P <0.0001). In addition, we obtained mutants for the A and B genome copies of the paralogous SBEIIb gene, mapped them 1-2 cM from SBEIIa , and generated double SBEIIa-SBEIIb mutants to study the effect of the SBEIIb gene in the absence of SBEIIa . These mutants are available to those interested in increasing amylose content and resistant starch in durum wheat."

"27273251","abstracttext","Low molecular weight glutenin subunit is one of the important quality elements in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Although considerable allelic variation has been identified, the functional properties of individual alleles at Glu-3 loci are less studied. In this work, we performed the first comprehensive study on the molecular characteristics and functional properties of the Glu-B3h gene using the wheat cultivar CB037B and its Glu-B3 deletion line CB037C. The results showed that the Glu-B3h deletion had no significant effects on plant morphological or yield traits, but resulted in a clear reduction in protein body number and size and main quality parameters, including inferior mixing property, dough strength, loaf volume, and score. Molecular characterization showed that the Glu-B3h gene consists of 1179 bp, and its encoded B-subunit has a longer repetitive domain and an increased number of α-helices, as well as higher expression, which could contribute to superior flour quality. The SNP-based allele-specific PCR markers designed for the Glu-B3h gene were developed and validated with bread wheat holding various alleles at Glu-B3 locus, which could effectively distinguish the Glu-B3h gene from others at the Glu-B3 locus, and have potential applications for wheat quality improvement through marker-assisted selection."

"27860150","abstracttext","The fungus Parastagonospora nodorum is the causal agent of Septoria nodorum blotch of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The interaction is mediated by multiple fungal necrotrophic effector-dominant host sensitivity gene interactions. The three best-characterized effector-sensitivity gene systems are SnToxA-Tsn1, SnTox1-Snn1 and SnTox3-Snn3. These effector genes are highly expressed during early infection, but expression decreases as the infection progresses to tissue necrosis and sporulation. However, the mechanism of regulation is unknown. We have identified and functionally characterized a gene, referred to as PnPf2, which encodes a putative zinc finger transcription factor. PnPf2 deletion resulted in the down-regulation of SnToxA and SnTox3 expression. Virulence on Tsn1 and Snn3 wheat cultivars was strongly reduced. The SnTox1-Snn1 interaction remained unaffected. Furthermore, we have also identified and deleted an orthologous PtrPf2 from the tan spot fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis which possesses a near-identical ToxA that was acquired from P. nodorum via horizontal gene transfer. PtrPf2 deletion also resulted in the down-regulation of PtrToxA expression and a near-complete loss of virulence on Tsn1 wheat. We have demonstrated, for the first time, evidence for a functionally conserved signalling component that plays a role in the regulation of a common/horizontally transferred effector found in two major fungal pathogens of wheat."

"17972648","abstracttext","Wheat, Triticum aestivum L., with Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) resistance based on the Dn4 gene has been important in managing Russian wheat aphid since 1994. Recently, five biotypes (RWA1-RWA5) of this aphid have been described based on their ability to differentially damage RWA resistance genes in wheat. RWA2, RWA4, and RWA5 are of great concern because they can kill wheat with Dn4 resistance. In 2005, 365 Russian wheat aphid clone colonies were made from collections taken from 98 fields of wheat or barley, Hordeum vulgare L., in Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, and Wyoming to determine their biotypic status. The biotype of each clone was determined through its ability to differentially damage two resistant and two susceptible wheat entries in two phases of screening. The first phase determined the damage responses of Russian wheat aphid wheat entries with resistance genes Dn4, Dn7, and susceptible 'Custer' to infestations by each clone to identify RWA1 to RWA4. The second phase used the responses of Custer and 'Yuma' wheat to identify RWA1 and RWA5. Only two biotypes, RWA1 and RWA2, were identified in this study. The biotype composition across all collection sites was 27.2% RWA1 and 72.8% RWA2. RWA biotype frequency by state indicated that RWA2 was the predominant biotype and composed 73-95% of the biotype complex in Texas, Oklahoma, Colorado, and Wyoming. Our study indicated that RWA2 is widely distributed and that it has rapidly dominated the biotype complex in wheat and barley within its primary range from Texas to Wyoming. Wheat with the Dn4 resistance gene will have little value in managing RWA in the United States, based on the predominance of RWA2."

"22277161","abstracttext_background","Alteration in gene expression resulting from allopolyploidization is a prominent feature in plants, but its spectrum and extent are not fully known. Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) was formed via allohexaploidization about 10,000 years ago, and became the most important crop plant. To gain further insights into the genome-wide transcriptional dynamics associated with the onset of common wheat formation, we conducted microarray-based genome-wide gene expression analysis on two newly synthesized allohexaploid wheat lines with chromosomal stability and a genome constitution analogous to that of the present-day common wheat."
"22277161","abstracttext_results","Multi-color GISH (genomic in situ hybridization) was used to identify individual plants from two nascent allohexaploid wheat lines between Triticum turgidum (2n=4x=28; genome BBAA) and Aegilops tauschii (2n=2x=14; genome DD), which had a stable chromosomal constitution analogous to that of common wheat (2n=6x=42; genome BBAADD). Genome-wide analysis of gene expression was performed for these allohexaploid lines along with their parental plants from T. turgidum and Ae. tauschii, using the Affymetrix Gene Chip Wheat Genome-Array. Comparison with the parental plants coupled with inclusion of empirical mid-parent values (MPVs) revealed that whereas the great majority of genes showed the expected parental additivity, two major patterns of alteration in gene expression in the allohexaploid lines were identified: parental dominance expression and non-additive expression. Genes involved in each of the two altered expression patterns could be classified into three distinct groups, stochastic, heritable and persistent, based on their transgenerational heritability and inter-line conservation. Strikingly, whereas both altered patterns of gene expression showed a propensity of inheritance, identity of the involved genes was highly stochastic, consistent with the involvement of diverse Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Nonetheless, those genes showing non-additive expression exhibited a significant enrichment for vesicle-function."
"22277161","abstracttext_conclusions","Our results show that two patterns of global alteration in gene expression are conditioned by allohexaploidization in wheat, that is, parental dominance expression and non-additive expression. Both altered patterns of gene expression but not the identity of the genes involved are likely to play functional roles in stabilization and establishment of the newly formed allohexaploid plants, and hence, relevant to speciation and evolution of T. aestivum."

"30982471","abstracttext_background","Sequence exchange between homologous chromosomes through crossing over and gene conversion is highly conserved among eukaryotes, contributing to genome stability and genetic diversity. A lack of recombination limits breeding efforts in crops; therefore, increasing recombination rates can reduce linkage drag and generate new genetic combinations."
"30982471","abstracttext_results","We use computational analysis of 13 recombinant inbred mapping populations to assess crossover and gene conversion frequency in the hexaploid genome of wheat (Triticum aestivum). We observe that high-frequency crossover sites are shared between populations and that closely related parents lead to populations with more similar crossover patterns. We demonstrate that gene conversion is more prevalent and covers more of the genome in wheat than in other plants, making it a critical process in the generation of new haplotypes, particularly in centromeric regions where crossovers are rare. We identify quantitative trait loci for altered gene conversion and crossover frequency and confirm functionality for a novel RecQ helicase gene that belongs to an ancient clade that is missing in some plant lineages including Arabidopsis."

However, its classification, evolutionary history and gene expression patterns are unclear in wheat and Aegilops tauschii."
"31438842","abstracttext_results","Here, we identified 374, 159 and 169 PRXs in Triticum aestivum, Triticum urartu and Ae. tauschii, respectively. Together with PRXs detected from eight other plants, they were classified into 18 subfamilies. Among subfamilies V to XVIII, a conserved exon-intron structure within the ""001"" exon phases was detected in the PRX domain. Based on the analysis, we proposed a phylogenetic model to infer the evolutionary history of the exon-intron structures of PRX subfamilies. A comparative genomics analysis showed that subfamily VII could be the ancient subfamily that originated from green algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii). Further integrated analysis of chromosome locations and collinearity events of PRX genes suggested that both whole genome duplication (WGD) and tandem duplication (TD) events contributed to the expansion of T. aestivum PRXs (TaePRXs) during wheat evolution. To validate functions of these genes in the regulation of various physiological processes, the expression patterns of PRXs in different tissues and under various stresses were studied using public microarray datasets. The results suggested that there were distinct expression patterns among different tissues and PRXs could be involved in biotic and abiotic responses in wheat. qRT-PCR was performed on samples exposed to drought, phytohormone treatments and Fusarium graminearum infection to validate the microarray predictions. The predicted subcellular localizations of some TaePRXs were consistent with the confocal microscopy results. We predicted that some TaePRXs had hormone-responsive cis-elements in their promoter regions and validated these predicted cis-acting elements by sequencing promoters."

"18325922","abstracttext","Salt tolerance of plants depends on HKT transporters (High-affinity K(+) Transporter), which mediate Na(+)-specific transport or Na(+)-K(+) co-transport. Gene sequences closely related to rice HKT genes were isolated from hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) or barley (Hordeum vulgare) for genomic DNA southern hybridization analysis. HKT gene sequences were mapped on chromosomal arms of wheat and barley using wheat chromosome substitution lines and barley-wheat chromosome addition lines. In addition, HKT gene members in the wild diploid wheat ancestors, T. monococcum (A(m) genome), T. urartu (A(u) genome), and Ae. tauschii (D(t) genome) were investigated. Variation in copy number for individual HKT gene members was observed between the barley, wheat, and rice genomes, and between the different wheat genomes. HKT2;1/2-like, HKT2;3/4-like, HKT1;1/2-like, HKT1;3-like, HKT1;4-like, and HKT1;5-like genes were mapped to the wheat-barley chromosome groups 7, 7, 2, 6, 2, and 4, respectively. Chromosomal regions containing HKT genes were syntenic between wheat and rice except for the chromosome regions containing the HKT1;5-like gene. Potential roles of HKT genes in Na(+) transport in rice, wheat, and barley are discussed. Determination of the chromosome locations of HKT genes provides a framework for future physiological and genetic studies investigating the relationships between HKT genes and salt tolerance in wheat and barley."

"15514045","abstracttext","The objectives of this study were to develop a high-density chromosome bin map of homoeologous group 7 in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), to identify gene distribution in these chromosomes, and to perform comparative studies of wheat with rice and barley. We mapped 2148 loci from 919 EST clones onto group 7 chromosomes of wheat. In the majority of cases the numbers of loci were significantly lower in the centromeric regions and tended to increase in the distal regions. The level of duplicated loci in this group was 24% with most of these loci being localized toward the distal regions. One hundred nineteen EST probes that hybridized to three fragments and mapped to the three group 7 chromosomes were designated landmark probes and were used to construct a consensus homoeologous group 7 map. An additional 49 probes that mapped to 7AS, 7DS, and the ancestral translocated segment involving 7BS also were designated landmarks. Landmark probe orders and comparative maps of wheat, rice, and barley were produced on the basis of corresponding rice BAC/PAC and genetic markers that mapped on chromosomes 6 and 8 of rice. Identification of landmark ESTs and development of consensus maps may provide a framework of conserved coding regions predating the evolution of wheat genomes."

"15741658","abstracttext","Genetic differences between 20 Chinese wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landraces highly resistant to Fusarium head blight (FHB) and 4 wheat lines highly susceptible to FHB were evaluated by means of microsatellite markers, in order to select suitable parents for gene mapping studies. Thirty-nine out of 40 microsatellite markers (97.5%) were polymorphic among the 24 wheat genotypes. A total of 276 alleles were detected at the 40 microsatellite loci. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 1 to 16, with an average of 6.9 alleles. Among these microsatellite loci, the largest polymorphism information content (PIC) value was 0.914 (GWM484), while the lowest PIC value was 0 (GWM24). The mean genetic similarity index among the 24 genotypes was 0.419, ranging from 0.103 to 0.673. Clustering analysis indicated that the highly susceptible synthetic wheat line RSP was less genetically related to and more divergent from the Chinese highly resistant landraces. These results were useful in the identification of suitable parents for the development of mapping populations for tagging the FHB resistance genes among these Chinese wheat landraces."

"18437345","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a hexaploid species with a large and complex genome. A reference genetic marker map, namely the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) map, has been constructed with the recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross involving a synthetic line. But it is not sufficient for a full understanding of the wheat genome under artificial selection without comparing it with intervarietal maps. Using an intervarietal mapping population derived by crossing Nanda2419 and Wangshuibai, we constructed a high-density genetic map of wheat. The total map length was 4,223.1 cM, comprising 887 loci, 345 of which were detected by markers derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Two-thirds of the high marker density blocks were present in interstitial and telomeric regions. The map covered, mostly with the EST-derived markers, approximately 158 cM of telomeric regions absent in the ITMI map. The regions of low marker density were largely conserved among cultivars and between homoeologous subgenomes. The loci showing skewed segregation displayed a clustered distribution along chromosomes and some of the segregation distortion regions (SDR) are conserved in different mapping populations. This map enriched with EST-derived markers is important for structure and function analysis of wheat genome as well as in wheat gene mapping, cloning, and breeding programs."

"15299127","abstracttext","This study investigates how the ILR1-like indole acetic acid (IAA) amidohydrolase family of genes has functionally evolved in the monocotyledonous species wheat (Triticum aestivum). An ortholog for the Arabidopsis IAR3 auxin amidohydrolase gene has been isolated from wheat (TaIAR3). The TaIAR3 protein hydrolyzes negligible levels of IAA-Ala and no other IAA amino acid conjugates tested, unlike its ortholog IAR3. Instead, TaIAR3 has low specificity for the ester conjugates IAA-Glc and IAA-myoinositol and high specificity for the conjugates of indole-3-butyric acid (IBA-Ala and IBA-Gly) and indole-3-propionic-acid (IPA-Ala) so far tested. TaIAR3 did not convert the methyl esters of the IBA conjugates with Ala and Gly. IBA and IBA conjugates were detected in wheat seedlings by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, where the conjugate of IBA with Ala may serve as a natural substrate for this enzyme. Endogenous IPA and IPA conjugates were not detected in the seedlings. Additionally, crude protein extracts of wheat seedlings possess auxin amidohydrolase activity. Temporal expression studies of TaIAR3 indicate that the transcript is initially expressed at day 1 after germination. Expression decreases through days 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20. Spatial expression studies found similar levels of expression throughout all wheat tissues examined."

"16374594","abstracttext","The gene Lr46 has provided slow-rusting resistance to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina in wheat (Triticum aestivum), which has remained durable for almost 30 years. Using linked markers and wheat deletion stocks, we located Lr46 in the deletion bin 1BL (0.84-0.89) comprising 5% of the 1BL arm. The distal part of chromosome 1BL of wheat is syntenic to chromosome 5L of rice. Wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) mapping in the terminal 15% of chromosome 1BL with significant homology to sequences from the terminal region of chromosome 5L of rice were chosen for sequence-tagged site (STS) primer design and were mapped physically and genetically. In addition, sequences from two rice bacterial artificial chromosome clones covering the targeted syntenic region were used to identify additional linked wheat ESTs. Fourteen new markers potentially linked to Lr46 were developed; eight were mapped in a segregating population. Markers flanking (2.2 cM proximal and 2.2 cM distal) and cosegregating with Lr46 were identified. The physical location of Lr46 was narrowed to a submicroscopic region between the breakpoints of deletion lines 1BL-13 [fraction length (FL)=0.89-1] and 1BL-10 (FL=0.89-3). We are now developing a high-resolution mapping population for the positional cloning of Lr46."

"21961939","abstracttext","Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy, a wild relative of bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), is the source of many agronomically important genes for wheat improvement. Production of compensating Robertsonian translocations (cRobTs), consisting of D. villosum chromosome arms translocated to homoeologous wheat chromosome arms, is one of the initial steps in exploiting this variation. The cRobTs for D. villosum chromosomes 1V, 4V, and 6V have been reported previously. Here we report attempted cRobTs for wheat - D. villosum chromosome combinations 2D/2V, 3D/3V, 5D/5V, and 7D/7V. The cRobTs for all D. villosum chromosomes were recovered except for the 2VS and 5VL arms. As was the case with the 6D/6V combination, no cRobTs involving 2D/2V chromosomes were recovered; instead, cRobT T2BS·2VL involving a nontargeted chromosome was recovered. All cRobTs are fertile, although the level of spike fertility and hundred kernel weight (HKW) varied among the lines. The set of cRobTs involving 12 of the 14 D. villosum chromosomes will be useful in wheat improvement programs. In fact, among the already reported cRobTs, T6AL·6VS carrying the Pm21 gene is deployed in agriculture and many useful genes have been reported on other cRobTs including resistance to stem rust race UG99 on T6AS·6VL."

"22956245","articletitle","Mapping of wheat mitochondrial mRNA termini and comparison with breakpoints in DNA homology among plants."
"22956245","abstracttext","Mitochondrial DNA rearrangements occur very frequently in flowering plants and when close to genes there must be concomitant acquisition of new regulatory cis-elements. To explore whether there might be limits to such DNA shuffling, we have mapped the termini of mitochondrial mRNAs in wheat, a monocot, and compared them to the known positions for counterpart genes in the eudicot Arabidopsis. Nine genes share homologous 3' UTRs over their full-length and for six of them, the termini map very close to the site of wheat/Arabidopsis DNA rearrangements. Only one such case was seen for comparisons of 5' UTRs, and the 5' ends of mRNAs are typically more heterogeneous than 3' termini. Approximately half of the thirty-one wheat mitochondrial transcriptional units are preceded by CRTA promoter-like motifs, and of the potential stem-loop or tRNA-like structures identified as candidate RNA processing/stability signals near the 5' or 3' ends, several are shared with Arabidopsis. Comparison of the mitochondrial gene flanking sequences from normal fertile wheat (Triticum aestivum) with those of Aegilops kotschyi which is the source of mitochondria present in K-type cytoplasmic male sterile wheat, revealed six cases where mRNAs are precluded from sharing full-length homologous UTRs because of genomic reorganization events, and the presence of short repeats located at the sites of discontinuity points to a reciprocal recombination-mediated mode of rearrangement."

"24193616","abstracttext","We have recently reported the isolation and characterization of a glycoprotein (Mr 67 000) from germ-tube walls of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici which elicits the cellular hypersensitive lignification response in wheat (G.

In enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays using anti-Pgt elicitor antibodies, specific binding sites for Pgt elicitor were detected in highly purified plasma-membrane vesicles of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) primary leaf cells. Binding proved to be independent of the presence or absence in wheat of the Sr5 gene for rust resistance, and also occurred on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) plasma membrane. The binding sites have an Mr of 30 000 and 33 000, respectively, and binding activity was not lost in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate. [(14)C]imido-Pgt elicitor was used to determine the apparent K d value for specific binding, found to be 2.0 μM, and the maximum content of binding sites, found to be 250 pmol per mg of plasma-membrane protein. The relevance of the elicitor binding for the outcome of the interaction of P. graminis and wheat is discussed."

In the F3 generation, 3M(b)(4B) substitution lines and 3M(b).4BS centric fusions were identified with in situ hybridization using repetitive and genomic DNA probes, and with SSR markers. Grain micronutrient analysis showed that the investigated Ae. biuncialis accession MvGB382 and the parental line MvGB642 are suitable gene sources for improving the grain micronutrient content of wheat, as they have higher K, Zn, Fe, and Mn contents. The results suggested that the Ae. biuncialis chromosome 3M(b) carries genes determining the grain micronutrient content, as the 3M(b).4BS centric fusion had significantly higher Zn and Mn contents compared with the recipient wheat cultivar. As yield-related traits, such as the number of tillers, the length of main spike, and spikelets per main spike, were similar in the 3M(b).4BS centric fusion and the parental wheat genotype, it can be concluded that this line could be used in pre-breeding programs aimed at enriching elite wheat cultivars with essential micronutrients."
"27735125","articletitle","The defence-associated transcriptome of hexaploid wheat displays homoeolog expression and induction bias."
"27735125","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an allopolyploid species containing three ancestral genomes. Therefore, three homoeologous copies exist for the majority of genes in the wheat genome. Whether different homoeologs are differentially expressed (homoeolog expression bias) in response to biotic and abiotic stresses is poorly understood. In this study, we applied a RNA-seq approach to analyse homoeolog-specific global gene expression patterns in wheat during infection by the fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum, which causes crown rot disease in cereals. To ensure specific detection of homoeologs, we first optimized read alignment methods and validated the results experimentally on genes with known patterns of subgenome-specific expression. Our global analysis identified widespread patterns of differential expression among homoeologs, indicating homoeolog expression bias underpins a large proportion of the wheat transcriptome. In particular, genes differentially expressed in response to Fusarium infection were found to be disproportionately contributed from B and D subgenomes. In addition, we found differences in the degree of responsiveness to pathogen infection among homoeologous genes with B and D homoeologs exhibiting stronger responses to pathogen infection than A genome copies. We call this latter phenomenon as 'homoeolog induction bias'. Understanding how homoeolog expression and induction biases operate may assist the improvement of biotic stress tolerance in wheat and other polyploid crop species."

"29527219","abstracttext","Anther development progresses through 15 distinct developmental stages in wheat, and accurate determination of anther developmental stages is essential in anther and pollen studies. A detailed outline of the development of the wheat anther through its entire developmental program, including the 15 distinct morphological stages, is presented. In bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), anther developmental stages were correlated with five measurements, namely auricle distance, spike length, spikelet length, anther length and anther width. Spike length and auricle distance were shown to be suitable for rapid anther staging within cultivars. Anther length is an accurate measurement in determining anther stages and may be applicable for use between cultivars. Tapetal Programmed Cell Death (PCD) in wheat begins between late tetrad stage (stage 8) and the early young microspore stage (stage 9) of anther development. Tapetal PCD continues until the vacuolate pollen stage (stage 11), at which point the tapetum fully degrades. The timing of tapetal PCD initiation is slightly delayed compared to that in rice, but is two stages earlier than in the model dicot Arabidopsis. The MYB80 gene, which encodes a transcription factor regulating the timing of tapetal PCD, reaches its peak expression at the onset of tapetal PCD in wheat."

"29099990","abstracttext","Our previous genetic analysis of a tetraploid wild wheat species, Aegilops peregrina, predicted that a single gene per haploid genome, Bgc-1, controls B-type starch granule content in the grain. To test whether bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has orthologous Bgc-1 loci, we screened a population of γ-irradiated bread wheat cv. Paragon for deletions of the group 4 chromosomes spanning Bgc-1. Suitable deletions, each encompassing ~600-700 genes, were discovered for chromosomes 4A and 4D. These two deletions are predicted to have 240 homoeologous genes in common. In contrast to single deletion mutant plants, double deletion mutants were found to lack B-type starch granules. The B-less grains had normal A-type starch granule morphology, normal overall starch content, and normal grain weight. In addition to variation in starch granule size distribution, the B-less wheat grains differed from controls in grain hardness, starch swelling power, and amylose content. We believe that these B-less wheat plants are the only Triticeae cereals available that combine substantial alterations in starch granule size distribution with minimal impact on starch content."

"31063029","abstracttext","Dasypyrum villosum is a wild relative of common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) with resistance to Puccinia graminis f. tritici , the causal agent of stem rust, including the highly virulent race TTKSK (Ug99). In order to transfer resistance, T. durum - D. villosum amphiploids were initially developed and used as a bridge to create wheat- D. villosum introgression lines. Conserved ortholog set (COS) markers were used to identify D. villosum chromosome introgression lines, which were then subjected to seedling P. graminis f. tritici resistance screening with race TTKSK. A COS marker-verified line carrying chromosome 2V with TTKSK resistance was further characterized by combined genomic in situ and fluorescent in situ analyses to confirm a monosomic substitution line MS2V(2D) (20″ + 1' 2V[2D]). This is the first report of stem rust resistance on 2V, which was temporarily designated as SrTA10276-2V . To facilitate the use of this gene in wheat improvement, a complete set of previously developed wheat- D. villosum disomic addition lines was subjected to genotyping-by-sequencing analysis to develop D. villosum chromosome-specific markers. On average, 350 markers per chromosome were identified. These markers can be used to develop diagnostic markers for D. villosum -derived genes of interest in wheat improvement."

"32678930","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe (teleomorph Gibberella zeae (Schw.) Perch) results in large yield losses in annual global wheat production. Although studies have identified a number of wheat FHB resistance genes, a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying host plant resistance to F. graminearum is required for the control of FHB. Here, an integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics analysis of infected wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.) enabled identification of 789 differentially accumulated metabolites, including flavonoids, phenolamides, tryptamine derivatives, and phytohormones, and revealed altered expression of more than 100 genes that function in the biosynthesis or regulation of these pathways. Our data regarding the effects of F. graminearum infection on flavonoids and auxin signaling led to follow-up experiments that showed that exogenous kaempferide and apigenin application on spikes increased wheat resistance to FHB, while exogenous auxin treatment increased FHB susceptibility. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the gene encoding the auxin receptor, TaTIR1, increased FHB resistance. Our data supported the use of TaTIR1 knockdown in controlling FHB. Our study provides insights on the wheat response to F. graminearum infection and its FHB resistance mechanisms while illustrating the potential of TaTIR1 knockdown in increasing FHB resistance during crop improvement programs."

"30231049","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks, is an important disease of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide and there is an indication that it may also become a serious disease of durum wheat (T. turgidum L. var. durum). Therefore, we investigated the genetic architecture underlying resistance to stripe rust in adapted durum wheat germplasm. Wheat infection assays were conducted under controlled conditions in Canada and under field conditions in Mexico. Disease assessments were performed on a population of 155 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from the cross of Kofa (susceptible) and W9262-260D3 (moderately resistant) and on a breeding panel that consisted of 92 diverse cultivars and breeding lines. Both populations were genotyped using the 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) iSelect assay. In the DH population, QTL for stripe rust resistance were identified on chromosome 7B (LOD 6.87-11.47) and chromosome 5B (LOD 3.88-9.17). The QTL for stripe rust resistance on chromosome 7B was supported in the breeding panel. Both QTL were anchored to the genome sequence of wild emmer wheat, which identified gene candidates involved in disease resistance. Exome capture sequencing identified variation in the candidate genes between Kofa and W9262-260D3. These genetic insights will be useful in durum breeding to enhance resistance to stripe rust."

"31176733","abstracttext","Low temperature is a key stress factor for the growth and development of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and glycometabolism plays an important role in plant cold tolerance. Our previous study identified trehalose 6-phosphate synthase 11 gene (TaTPS11), which had a significantly different expression pattern between a high freezing-tolerant wheat cultivar and a low freezing-tolerant wheat cultivar. In this study, TaTPS11 was isolated from a winter-hardy wheat cultivar (D1) and overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana to study its effect on cold tolerance in plants. Transgenic plants expressing TaTPS11 had lower sucrose content, higher starch content, and higher activity of key enzyme (sucrose phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, and invertase) involved in sucrose metabolism. In addition, the expression level of sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinase 1 (SnRK1), which catalyzes the sucrose in plants, increased in the TaTPS11-overexpressed plants. These results indicated that heterologous expression of TaTPS11 influenced carbohydrate metabolism in Arabidopsis plants. The resultant plants had a significantly higher survival rate after -5 °C treatment for 2 h and exhibited enhanced cold tolerance without unfavorable phenotypes compared to wild-type. Our findings indicated that manipulation of TaTPS11 improved cold tolerance in plants and TaTPS11 had potential values in wheat cold-tolerance breeding."

"31465541","abstracttext","Awns are stiff, hair-like structures which grow from the lemmas of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other grasses that contribute to photosynthesis and play a role in seed dispersal. Variation in awn length in domesticated wheat is controlled primarily by three major genes, most commonly the dominant awn suppressor Tipped1 (B1). This study identifies a transcription repressor responsible for awn inhibition at the B1 locus. Association mapping was combined with analysis in biparental populations to delimit B1 to a distal region of 5AL colocalized with QTL for number of spikelets per spike, kernel weight, kernel length, and test weight. Fine-mapping located B1 to a region containing only two predicted genes, including C2H2 zinc finger transcriptional repressor TraesCS5A02G542800 upregulated in developing spikes of awnless individuals. Deletions encompassing this candidate gene were present in awned mutants of an awnless wheat. Sequence polymorphisms in the B1 coding region were not observed in diverse wheat germplasm whereas a nearby polymorphism was highly predictive of awn suppression. Transcriptional repression by B1 is the major determinant of awn suppression in global wheat germplasm. It is associated with increased number of spikelets per spike and decreased kernel size."
"31575724","articletitle","A GDSL Esterase/Lipase Catalyzes the Esterification of Lutein in Bread Wheat."
"31575724","abstracttext","Xanthophylls are a class of carotenoids that are important micronutrients for humans. They are often found esterified with fatty acids in fruits, vegetables, and certain grains, including bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ). Esterification promotes the sequestration and accumulation of carotenoids, thereby enhancing stability, particularly in tissues such as in harvested wheat grain. Here, we report on a plant xanthophyll acyltransferase (XAT) that is both necessary and sufficient for xanthophyll esterification in bread wheat grain. XAT contains a canonical Gly-Asp-Ser-Leu (GDSL) motif and is encoded by a member of the GDSL esterase/lipase gene family. Genetic evidence from allelic variants of wheat and transgenic rice ( Oryza sativa ) calli demonstrated that XAT catalyzes the formation of xanthophyll esters. XAT has broad substrate specificity and can esterify lutein, β-cryptoxanthin, and zeaxanthin using multiple acyl donors, yet it has a preference for triacylglycerides, indicating that the enzyme acts via transesterification. A conserved amino acid, Ser-37, is required for activity. Despite xanthophylls being synthesized in plastids, XAT accumulated in the apoplast. Based on analysis of substrate preferences and xanthophyll ester formation in vitro and in vivo using xanthophyll-accumulating rice callus, we propose that disintegration of the cellular structure during wheat grain desiccation facilitates access to lutein-promoting transesterification.plantcell;31/12/3092/FX1F1fx1."

Currently, the role of E3 ubiquitin ligase in the plant immune response to pathogens is well defined. However, the role of ClpS1 in the plant immune response to pathogens remains unknown."

The transcript level of TaClpS1 in wheat was significantly induced during infection by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Knockdown of TaClpS1 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) resulted in an increase in wheat resistance against Pst, accompanied by an increase in the hypersensitive response (HR), accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and expression of TaPR1 and TaPR2, and a reduction in the number of haustoria, length of infection hypha and infection area of Pst. Furthermore, heterologous expression of TaClpS1 in Nicotiana benthamiana enhanced the infection by Phytophthora parasitica."

"26255630","abstracttext","Preharvest sprouting (PHS) is one of the major constraints of wheat production in areas where prolonged rainfall occurs during harvest. TaPHS1 is a gene that regulates PHS resistance on chromosome 3A of wheat, and two causal mutations in the positions +646 and +666 of the TaPHS1 coding region result in wheat PHS susceptibility. Three competitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed based on the two mutations in the coding region and one in the promoter region and validated in 82 wheat cultivars with known genotypes. These markers can be used to transfer TaPHS1 in breeding through marker-assisted selection. Screening of 327 accessions of wheat A genome progenitors using the three KASP markers identified different haplotypes in both diploid and tetraploid wheats. Only one Triticum monococcum accession, however, carries both causal mutations in the TaPHS1 coding region and shows PHS susceptibility. Five of 249 common wheat landraces collected from the Fertile Crescent and surrounding areas carried the mutation (C) in the promoter (-222), and one landrace carries both the causal mutations in the TaPHS1 coding region, indicating that the mis-splicing (+646) mutation occurred during common wheat domestication. PHS assay of wheat progenitor accessions demonstrated that the wild-types were highly PHS-resistant, whereas the domesticated type showed increased PHS susceptibility. The mis-splicing TaPHS1 mutation for PHS susceptibility was involved in wheat domestication and might arise independently between T. monococcum and Triticum aestivum."

"29204736","abstracttext","We evaluated the effect of lipopolysaccharides from the plant-growth-promoting associative bacterium Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 and from the enteric bacterium Escherichia coli K12 on the morphogenic potential of in vitro-growing somatic calluses of soft spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Saratovskaya 29). A genetic model was used that included two near-isogenic lines of T. aestivum L. cv. Saratovskaya 29 with different embryogenic capacities; one of these lines carries the Rht-B1 dwarfing gene, whereas the other lacks it. When added to the nutrient medium, the lipopolysaccharide of A. brasilense Sp245 promoted the formation of calluses with meristematic centers and stimulated the regeneration ability of the cultured tissues in both lines. By contrast, the lipopolysaccharide of the enteric bacterium E. coli K12 barely affected the morphogenetic activity of callus cells and the yield of morphogenic calluses and regenerated plants. These findings indicate that the lipopolysaccharide of the plant-growth-promoting associative bacterium A. brasilense Sp245 specifically enhances the morphogenetic activity of wheat somatic tissues, which increases the efficacy of culturing of genotypes with a relatively low morphogenic potential. The results of the study may contribute to the improvement of the efficacy of plant cell selection and gene engineering and to a better understanding of the mechanisms responsible for plant recognition of lipopolysaccharides of associative bacteria."

"31527624","abstracttext","Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are involved in the responses and adaptation of plants to various abiotic stresses, including dehydration, salinity, high temperature, and cold. Here, we report the first comprehensive survey of the LEA gene family in ""Chinese Spring"" wheat (Triticum aestivum). A total of 179 TaLEA genes were identified in T. aestivum and classified into eight groups. All TaLEA genes harbored the LEA conserved motif and had few introns. TaLEA genes belonging to the same group exhibited similar gene structures and chromosomal locations. Our results revealed that most TaLEA genes contained abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive elements (ABREs) and various cis-acting elements associated with the stress response in the promoter region and were induced under ABA and abiotic stress treatments. In addition, 8 genes representing each group were introduced into E. coli and yeast to investigate the protective function of TaLEAs under heat and salt stress. TaLEAs enhanced the tolerance of E. coli and yeast to salt and heat, indicating that these proteins have protective functions in host cells under stress conditions. These results increase our understanding of LEA genes and provide robust candidate genes for future functional investigations aimed at improving the stress tolerance of wheat."

"9631070","abstracttext","The unique bread-making characteristic of wheat flour is closely related to the elasticity and extensibility of the gluten proteins stored in the starchy endosperm, particularly the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS), which are important in determining gluten and dough elasticity. The quality of wheat cultivars depends on the number and composition of the HMW-GS present. We have introduced the HMW-GS 1Ax1 gene, known to be associated with good bread-making quality, into the Bob White cultivar of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), in which it is not present in nature, by the biolistic bombardment of cultured immature embryos. Of the 21 independent transformed lines selected, 20 expressed the selectable bar gene, and nine the 1Ax1 gene. The amount of HMW-GS 1Ax1 protein produced in the different transgenic lines varied from 0.6% to 2.3% of the total protein, resulting in an increase of up to 71% in total HMW-GS proteins. The transgenic plants were normal, fertile, and showed Mendelian segregation of the transgenes. The accumulation of HMW-GS 1Ax1 was consistent and stable up to the R3 seed generation. These results demonstrate that it is possible to manipulate both the quantity and quality of HMW-GS, which influence the bread-making quality of wheat."

"11908651","abstracttext","Oat receptor-like kinase gene sequences, homologous to the Lrk10 gene from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), were mapped in oat (Avena sativa L.). PCR primers designed from the wheat Lrk10 were used to produce ALrk10 from oat. Two DNA sequences, ALrk1A1 and ALrk4A5, were produced from primers designed from coding and noncoding regions of ALrk10. Their use as RFLP probes indicated that the kinase genes mapped to four loci on different hexaploid oat 'Kanota' x 'Ogle' linkage groups (4_12, 5, 6, and 13) and to a fifth locus unlinked to other markers. Three of these linkage groups contain a region homologous to the short arm of chromosome I of wheat and the fourth contains a region homologous to chromosome 3 of wheat. Analysis with several nullisomics of oat indicated that two of the map locations are on satellite chromosomes. RFLP mapping in a 'Dumont' x 'OT328' population indicated that one map location is closely linked to Pg9, a resistance gene to oat stem rust (Puccinia graminis subsp. avenae). Comparative mapping indicates this to be the region of a presumed cluster of crown rust (Puccinia coronata subsp. avenae) and stem rust resistance genes (Pg3, Pg9, Pc44, Pc46, Pc50, Pc68, Pc95, and PcX). The map position of several RGAs located on KO6 and KO3_38 with respect to Lrk10 and storage protein genes are also reported."
"16024692","articletitle","TaVRT-2, a member of the StMADS-11 clade of flowering repressors, is regulated by vernalization and photoperiod in wheat."
"16024692","abstracttext","The initiation of the reproductive phase in winter cereals is delayed during winter until favorable growth conditions resume in the spring. This delay is modulated by low temperature through the process of vernalization. The molecular and genetic bases of the interaction between environmental factors and the floral transition in these species are still unknown. However, the recent identification of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) TaVRT-1 gene provides an opportunity to decipher the molecular basis of the flowering-time regulation in cereals. Here, we describe the characterization of another gene, named TaVRT-2, possibly involved in the flowering pathway in wheat. Molecular and phylogenetic analyses indicate that the gene encodes a member of the MADS-box transcription factor family that belongs to a clade responsible for flowering repression in several species. Expression profiling of TaVRT-2 in near-isogenic lines and different genotypes with natural variation in their response to vernalization and photoperiod showed a strong relationship with floral transition. Its expression is up-regulated in the winter genotypes during the vegetative phase and in photoperiod-sensitive genotypes during short days, and is repressed by vernalization to a level that allows the transition to the reproductive phase. Protein-protein interaction studies revealed that TaVRT-2 interacts with proteins encoded by two important vernalization genes (TaVRT-1/VRN-1 and VRN-2) in wheat. These results support the hypothesis that TaVRT-2 is a putative repressor of the floral transition in wheat."

Resistance to multiple races of P. tritici-repentis was identified in a wide range of genetically diverse genotypes, including three different species Triticum aestivum (AABBDD), T. spelta (AABBDD), and T. turgidum (AABB). The major objectives of this study were to determine the genetic control of resistance to P. tritici-repentis races 1 and 5 in 12 newly identified sources of resistance. The parents, F(1), F(2), and F(2:3) or F(2:5) families of each cross were analyzed for the allelism tests and/or inheritance studies. Plants were inoculated at the two-leaf stage under controlled environmental conditions and disease reaction was assessed based on lesion-type rating scale. A single recessive gene controlled resistance to necrosis caused by P. tritici-repentis race 1 in both tetraploid and hexaploid resistant genotypes. The lack of segregation in the inter- and intra-specific crosses between the resistant tetraploid and hexaploid genotypes indicated that they possess the same genes for resistance to tan necrosis and chlorosis induced by P. tritici-repentis race 1. A single dominant gene for chlorosis in hexaploid wheat and a single recessive gene for necrosis in tetraploid wheat, controlled resistance to P. tritici-repentis race 5."

"17177786","abstracttext","The field performance of a viral gene in two Swiss wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties showed 10% increased fungal resistance against Tilletia caries (stinking smut). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of improved resistance against any fungus in the field achieved by genetic engineering in wheat. The genetically modified wheat lines previously showed a c. 30% decrease in symptoms of T. caries in the glasshouse (Clausen, M., Kräuter, R., Schachermayr, G., Potrykus, I. and Sautter, C.

A glasshouse experiment run in parallel to the field test, and using the same collection of T. caries, gave the same results. In a dose-response experiment with isolated fungal strains, in which the infection pressure was varied via the spore concentration, the transgene behaved as a quantitative resistance gene and shifted the S-shaped dose-response curve towards higher resistance. The transgene was shown to be highly specific for fungi of the order Ustilaginales. Tests of the transgene using cell cultures of eukaryotes, including hamster and human, showed no significant side-effects with respect to biosafety. Endogenous pathogen-related genes were also activated on fungal infection in the presence of the kp4 transgene."

"21974774","abstracttext","Wheat is the third most important crop for human nutrition in the world. The availability of high-resolution genetic and physical maps and ultimately a complete genome sequence holds great promise for breeding improved varieties to cope with increasing food demand under the conditions of changing global climate. However, the large size of the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome (approximately 17 Gb/1C) and the triplication of genic sequence resulting from its hexaploid status have impeded genome sequencing of this important crop species. Here we describe the use of mitotic chromosome flow sorting to separately purify and then shotgun-sequence a pair of telocentric chromosomes that together form chromosome 4A (856 Mb/1C) of wheat. The isolation of this much reduced template and the consequent avoidance of the problem of sequence duplication, in conjunction with synteny-based comparisons with other grass genomes, have facilitated construction of an ordered gene map of chromosome 4A, embracing ≥85% of its total gene content, and have enabled precise localization of the various translocation and inversion breakpoints on chromosome 4A that differentiate it from its progenitor chromosome in the A genome diploid donor. The gene map of chromosome 4A, together with the emerging sequences of homoeologous wheat chromosome groups 4, 5 and 7, represent unique resources that will allow us to obtain new insights into the evolutionary dynamics between homoeologous chromosomes and syntenic chromosomal regions."

"22457747","abstracttext","The timing of flowering during the year is an important adaptive character affecting reproductive success in plants and is critical to crop yield. Flowering time has been extensively manipulated in crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) during domestication, and this enables them to grow productively in a wide range of environments. Several major genes controlling flowering time have been identified in wheat with mutant alleles having sequence changes such as insertions, deletions or point mutations. We investigated genetic variants in commercial varieties of wheat that regulate flowering by altering photoperiod response (Ppd-B1 alleles) or vernalization requirement (Vrn-A1 alleles) and for which no candidate mutation was found within the gene sequence. Genetic and genomic approaches showed that in both cases alleles conferring altered flowering time had an increased copy number of the gene and altered gene expression. Alleles with an increased copy number of Ppd-B1 confer an early flowering day neutral phenotype and have arisen independently at least twice. Plants with an increased copy number of Vrn-A1 have an increased requirement for vernalization so that longer periods of cold are required to potentiate flowering. The results suggest that copy number variation (CNV) plays a significant role in wheat adaptation."

Stringent conditions were employed to reduce the false discovery rate. A total of 25 wheat unigenes were found to express differentially in response to F. graminearum infection. Genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins such as beta-1,3-glucanase (PR-2), wheatwins (PR-4), and thaumatin-like proteins (PR-5) showed a significant upregulation in genotypes having the Sumai-3 3BS region. For these three genes, the gene activity was significantly less in the genotype (NIL-3) lacking the Sumai-3 3BS segment. Significant upregulation of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase was detected only in the resistant Sumai-3, indicating the importance of both the 2AL and 3BS regions in the activation of effective defense responses to infection by F. graminearum. Differences in gene expression between the resistant Sumai-3 and the susceptible NILs were found to be mainly quantitative in nature."

"24013794","abstracttext_key message","Identification of TaS3 as a potential susceptibility gene encoding a protein homologous to ULP1 protease in wheat, which may regulate SUMO function facilitating powdery mildew attack. Some plant genes that are required for susceptibilities to certain pathogens are known as susceptibility genes or susceptibility factors, whose loss-of-function mutations can confer the plants resistances. To identify potential susceptibility genes to powdery mildew in wheat, differentially expressed genes in compatible and incompatible interactions between wheat and powdery mildew were examined by the cDNA chip assay. The genes exclusively expressed in the susceptible cultivar were interfered using biolistic transient transformation in wheat epidermal cells. The suppression of gene TaS3 (Triticum aestivum susceptibility) decreased the pathogen penetration by 19%, and its over-expression increased the disease susceptibility. The deduced protein from TaS3 belongs to the putative ubiquitin-like protease 1 peptidase domain family. Subcellular localization studies revealed that its protein was accumulated in the nucleus. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that TaS3 transcript was significantly induced in the compatible host. This suggests that TaS3 is a potential susceptible gene and its function may be related to regulate SUMO functions."

"28509374","abstracttext","Molecular genetic analyses revealed that the WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) gene superfamily regulates several programs in plant development. Many different mechanisms are reported to underlie these alterations. The WOX family member STENOFOLIA (STF) is involved in leaf expansion in the eudicot Medicago truncutula. Here, we report that when this gene was ectopically expressed in a locally adapted hard red winter wheat cultivar (Triticum aestivum), the transgenic plants showed not only widened leaves but also accelerated flowering and increased chlorophyll content. These desirable traits were stably inherited in the progeny plants. STF binds to wheat genes that have the (GA) n /(CT) n DNA cis element, regardless of sequences flanking the DNA repeats, suggesting a mechanism for its pleiotropic effects. However, the amino acids between position 91 and 262 in the STF protein that were found to bind with the (GA) n motif have no conserved domain with any other GAGA-binding proteins in animals or plants. We also found that STF interacted with a variety of proteins in wheat in yeast 2 hybrid assays. We conclude that the eudicot STF gene binds to (GA) n /(CT) n DNA elements and can be used to regulate leaf width, flowering time and chlorophyll content in monocot wheat."

"29085014","abstracttext","POPSEQ Ordered Triticum aestivum Gene Expression (POTAGE) is a web application which accelerates the process of identifying candidate genes for quantitative trait loci (QTL) in hexaploid wheat. This is achieved by leveraging several of the most commonly used data sets in wheat research. These include the Chromosome Survey Sequences, their order along the chromosomes determined by the population sequencing (POPSEQ) approach, the gene predictions and RNA-Seq expression data. POTAGE aggregates those data sets and provides an intuitive interface for biologists to explore the expression of the predicted genes and their functional annotation in a chromosomal context. The interface accelerates some of the laborious and repetitive tasks commonly undertaken in the process of identifying and prioritising genes which may underlie QTL. We illustrate the utility of POTAGE by showing how a short-list of candidate genes can quickly be identified for a QTL linked to pre-harvest sprouting - a major cause of quality and yield loss in wheat production. The candidate genes identified using POTAGE included TaMKK3, which was recently reported as a causal gene for seed dormancy in wheat, and a mutation in its barley ortholog has been shown to reduce pre-harvest sprouting.

"29874811","abstracttext","Autophagy-related 8 (ATG8) protein has been reported to be involved in plant's innate immune response, but it is not clear whether such genes play a similar role in cereal crops against obligate biotrophic fungal pathogens. Here, we reported an ATG8 gene from wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), designated TaATG8j . This gene has three copies located in chromosomes 2AS, 2BS, and 2DS. The transcriptions of all three copies were upregulated in plants of the wheat cultivar Suwon 11, inoculated with an avirulent race (CYR23) of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), the causal fungal pathogen of stripe rust. The transient expression of TaATG8j in Nicotiana benthamiana showed that TaATG8j proteins were distributed throughout the cytoplasm, but mainly in the nucleus and plasma membrane. The overexpression of TaATG8j in N. benthamiana slightly delayed the cell death caused by the mouse apoptotic protein BAX (BCL2-associated X protein). However, the expression of TaATG8j in yeast ( Schizosaccharomyces pombe ) induced cell death. The virus-induced gene silencing of all TaATG8j copies rendered Suwon 11 susceptible to the avirulent Pst race CYR23, accompanied by an increased fungal biomass and a decreased necrotic area per infection site. These results indicate that TaATG8j contributes to wheat resistance against stripe rust fungus by regulating cell death, providing information for the understanding of the mechanisms of wheat resistance to the stripe rust pathogen."

"31540915","abstracttext","Previous studies have revealed the functions of rice and maize AGAMOUS LIKE 6 ( AGL6 ) genes OsMADS6 and ZAG3 , respectively, in floral development; however, the functions of three wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) AGL6 genes are still unclear. Here, we report the main functions of wheat AGL6 homoeologous genes in stamen development. In RNAi plants, stamens showed abnormality in number and morphology, and a tendency to transform into carpels. Consistently, the expression of the B-class gene TaAPETALA3 ( AP3 ) and the auxin-responsive gene TaMGH3 was downregulated, whereas the wheat ortholog of the rice carpel identity gene DROOPING LEAF was ectopically expressed in RNAi stamens. TaAGL6 proteins bind to the promoter of TaAP3 directly. Yeast one-hybrid and transient expression assays further showed that TaAGL6 positively regulates the expression of TaAP3 in vivo. Wheat AGL6 transcription factors interact with TaAP3, TaAGAMOUS and TaMADS13. Our findings indicate that TaAGL6 transcription factors play an essential role in stamen development through transcriptional regulation of TaAP3 and other related genes. We propose a model to illustrate the function and probable mechanism of this regulation. This study extends our understanding of AGL6 genes."

"32883427","abstracttext","The cereal infecting fungus Fusarium graminearum is predicted to possess a single homologue of plant RALF (rapid alkalinisation factor) peptides. Fusarium mutant strains lacking FgRALF were generated and found to exhibit wildtype virulence on wheat and Arabidopsis floral tissue. Arabidopsis lines constitutively overexpressing FgRALF exhibited no obvious change in susceptibility to F. graminearum leaf infection. In contrast transient virus-mediated over-expression (VOX) of FgRALF in wheat prior to F. graminearum infection, slightly increased the rate of fungal colonisation of floral tissue. Ten putative Feronia (FER) receptors of RALF peptide were identified bioinformatically in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). Transient silencing of two wheat FER homoeologous genes prior to F. graminearum inoculation did not alter the subsequent interaction outcome. Collectively, our VOX results show that the fungal RALF peptide may be a minor contributor in F. graminearum virulence but results from fungal gene deletion experiments indicate potential functional redundancy within the F. graminearum genome. We demonstrate that virus-mediated over-expression is a useful tool to provide novel information about gene/protein function when results from gene deletion/disruption experimentation were uninformative."

"1799693","abstracttext","Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) shows local, induced resistance against the plant-pathogenic fungus Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici following exposure to the nonpathogen E. g. f. sp. hordei. The onset of this resistance has been shown to be correlated with the activation of putative defense genes, and cDNA clones representing transcripts of induced genes have been obtained (P. Schweizer, W. Hunziker, and E. Mösinger, Plant Molecular Biology 12:643-654, 1989). We have cloned and sequenced a gene corresponding to one of these cDNAs, WIR5. Sequence analysis indicated that this gene contains three exons and encodes a protein of 229 amino acids. S1 mapping showed that transcripts homologous to this gene are at least 20 times more abundant in leaves infected 14 hr earlier with E. g. f. sp. hordei than in control leaves. Sequence comparison showed that the WIR5 gene product is highly homologous to glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs; EC 25.1.18) of maize. This, together with the fact that the intron positions of both the wheat gene and the maize GSTI gene are conserved, suggests that the cloned pathogen-induced gene, named GstA1, encodes a wheat glutathione-S-transferase."

"28649263","abstracttext","Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a family of regulatory RNAs that play essential role in the various developmental processes and stress responses. Recent advances in sequencing technology and computational methods enabled identification and characterization of lncRNAs in certain plant species, but they are less known in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat). Herein, we analyzed 52 RNA seq data (>30 billion reads) and identified 44,698 lncRNAs in T. aestivum genome, which were characterized in comparison to the coding sequences (mRNAs). Similar to the mRNAs, lncRNAs were also derived from each sub-genome and chromosome, and showed tissue developmental stage specific and differential expression, as well. The modulated expression of lncRNAs during abiotic stresses like heat, drought, and salt indicated their putative role in stress response. The co-expression of lncRNAs with vital mRNAs including various transcription factors and enzymes involved in Abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis, and gene ontology mapping inferred their regulatory roles in numerous biological processes. A few lncRNAs were predicted as precursor (19 lncRNAs), while some as target mimics (1,047 lncRNAs) of known miRNAs involved in various regulatory functions. The results suggested numerous functions of lncRNAs in T. aestivum , and unfolded the opportunities for functional characterization of individual lncRNA in future studies."

"16334342","abstracttext","Genetic resistance is a useful control strategy for managing Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), in wheat, Triticum aestivum L. In 2003, a Russian wheat aphid population (denoted as biotype 2) identified in Colorado was virulent to genotypes carrying the Dn4 Russian wheat aphid resistance gene, necessitating the rapid identification and deployment of new sources of resistance. Although the Dn7 gene had shown excellent resistance to Russian wheat aphid biotypes 1 and 2 in evaluations in the greenhouse, no information is available on the amount of protection provided by Dn7 under field conditions. The objective of this study was to compare the reaction of Dn4- and Dn7-carrying spring wheat genotypes under artificial infestation by Russian wheat aphid biotype 1 in the field. Irrigated field experiments were conducted in 2003 and 2004 in a split-split plot arrangement with six replications. The whole plot treatment was infestation level (control, 1x, and 10x Russian wheat aphids), and the subplot treatment was resistance source (Dn4- and Dn7-carrying genotypes). The sub-subplot treatment consisted of side-by-side planting of resistant and susceptible genotypes. The Dn4 subplot was significantly more damaged than the Dn7 subplot in 2003, but not in 2004. Interaction effects observed in 2004 suggested an advantage of Dn7 relative to Dn4 in terms of reduced Russian wheat aphid abundance and plant damage. Deployment of the Dn7 Russian wheat aphid resistance gene should provide protection in the field comparable with that provided by the Dn4 resistance gene for management of Russian wheat aphid biotype 1."

"26687145","abstracttext_abstract","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) can negatively impact end-use quality and seed viability at planting. Due to preferences for white over red wheat in international markets, white wheat with PHS tolerance has become increasingly desired for worldwide wheat production. In general, however, red wheat is more tolerant of sprouting than white wheat. The main objective of this study was the identification of PHS tolerance conditioned by genes donated from hard red winter wheat, using markers applicable to the Great Plains hard white wheat gene pool. Three red wheat by white wheat populations, Niobrara/NW99L7068, NE98466/NW99L7068 and Jagalene/NW99L7068 were developed, and white-seeded progenies were analyzed for PHS tolerance and used to identify markers for the trait. In the three populations, marker loci with significant allelic effects were most commonly located on chromosomes of group 2, 3, 4 and 5, though additional markers were detected across the wheat genome. Chromosome 3A was the only chromosome with significant markers in all three populations. Markers were inconsistent across the three populations, and markers linked to tolerance-inducing loci were identified in both tolerant and susceptible parents. Additive effects of marker loci were common. In the present investigation, a wide range of PHS tolerance was observed, even though all lines were fixed for the recently reported positive TaPHS1 allele. PHS tolerance is controlled by additive major gene effects with minor gene effects where variations of minor gene effects were still unclear."

"17028150","abstracttext","Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum Desf.) Line 149 contains two novel major genes for excluding Na(+) from leaf blades, named Nax1 and Nax2. The genes were separated into families containing a single gene and near-isogenic homozygous lines were selected. Lines containing either Nax1 or Nax2 had lower rates of Na(+) transport from roots to shoots than their near-isogenic pairs due to lower rates of net loading of the xylem, not to lower rates of net uptake from the soil or higher rates of retranslocation in the phloem. Nax1 and Nax2 lines also had higher rates of K(+) transport from root to shoot, resulting in an enhanced discrimination of K(+) over Na(+). Lines containing Nax1 differed from those containing Nax2 by unloading Na(+) from the xylem as it entered the shoot so that Na(+) was retained in the base of the leaf, leading to a high sheath to blade ratio of Na(+) concentration. Gradients in tissue concentrations of Na(+) along the leaf suggested that Na(+) was continually removed from the xylem. The Nax2 line did not retain Na(+) in the base of the leaf, suggesting that it functioned only in the root. The Nax2 gene therefore has a similar function to Kna1 in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum)."

Three loci, Rad50A, Rad50B and Rad50D, none of which have been previously mapped using any kind of molecular approach, were localized at similar positions on the short arm of chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D, respectively. The loci are all proximal to 5S ribosomal gene clusters. The sensitivity and efficiency of the Tyr-FISH technique was tested using 5 differently sized fragments of the gene Rad50D as probes in FISH involving the chromosomes of the diploid wheat Triticum tauschii (the D-genome donor species of the hexaploid wheats). The procedure, which provided specific signal amplification with low level background, detected target DNA sequences as small as 2 kb with a frequency of 37.5%."

"15122014","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is an allohexaploid species, consisting of three subgenomes (A, B, and D). To study the molecular evolution of these closely related genomes, we compared the sequence of a 307-kb physical contig covering the high molecular weight (HMW)-glutenin locus from the A genome of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum, AABB) with the orthologous regions from the B genome of the same wheat and the D genome of the diploid wheat Aegilops tauschii (Anderson et al., 2003; Kong et al., 2004). Although gene colinearity appears to be retained, four out of six genes including the two paralogous HMW-glutenin genes are disrupted in the orthologous region of the A genome. Mechanisms involved in gene disruption in the A genome include retroelement insertions, sequence deletions, and mutations causing in-frame stop codons in the coding sequences. Comparative sequence analysis also revealed that sequences in the colinear intergenic regions of these different genomes were generally not conserved. The rapid genome evolution in these regions is attributable mainly to the large number of retrotransposon insertions that occurred after the divergence of the three wheat genomes. Our comparative studies indicate that the B genome diverged prior to the separation of the A and D genomes. Furthermore, sequence comparison of two distinct types of allelic variations at the HMW-glutenin loci in the A genomes of different hexaploid wheat cultivars with the A genome locus of durum wheat indicates that hexaploid wheat may have more than one tetraploid ancestor."

"22531790","abstracttext","Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an allohexaploid that originated from natural hybridization between tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum) and diploid Aegilops tauschii. Ae. tauschii is considered one of the potential sources of new genetic variation in abiotic stress tolerance for improving common wheat. Abscisic acid (ABA) plays an important role in plant adaptation to environmental stresses. In this study, ABA responsiveness of 67 Ae. tauschii accessions and their synthetic hexaploid wheat lines, derived from crosses between T. turgidum cv. Langdon and the Ae. tauschii accessions, was evaluated based on growth inhibition by 20 µM ABA. Wide variation was found in ABA responsiveness for both synthetic wheat lines and their parental Ae. tauschii accessions. The variations due to D-genome found at the diploid level were also expressed in a hexaploid genetic background. Two pairs of synthetic wheat lines differing in ABA responsiveness were then selected for gene expression analysis and to test abiotic stress tolerance, because their parental Ae. tauschii accessions similarly exhibited the differential response to ABA. Gene expression of ABA inducible transcription factor, WABI5, and the downstream Cor/Lea genes (Wrab17, Wdhn13 and Wrab18) were analysed. In one pair, the highly responsive line exhibited higher induction of Wrab17 by ABA treatment, but no significant difference in dehydration or salinity tolerance was observed between these lines. In contrast, in the second pair, the highly ABA-responsive line showed higher levels of Wdhn13 expression and dehydration and salinity tolerance. In synthetic wheat lines, the difference in the ABA responsiveness of the lines appeared to be determined by the different sets of D-genome genes. Our findings suggest that highly ABA-responsive Ae. tauschii accessions should be valuable genetic resources for improving the abiotic stress tolerance of common wheat."

"23766697","abstracttext","The genus Triticum includes bread (Triticum aestivum) and durum wheat (Triticum durum) and constitutes a major source for human food consumption. Drought is currently the leading threat on world's food supply, limiting crop yield, and is complicated since drought tolerance is a quantitative trait with a complex phenotype affected by the plant's developmental stage. Drought tolerance is crucial to stabilize and increase food production since domestication has limited the genetic diversity of crops including wild wheat, leading to cultivated species, adapted to artificial environments, and lost tolerance to drought stress. Improvement for drought tolerance can be achieved by the introduction of drought-grelated genes and QTLs to modern wheat cultivars. Therefore, identification of candidate molecules or loci involved in drought tolerance is necessary, which is undertaken by ""omics"" studies and QTL mapping. In this sense, wild counterparts of modern varieties, specifically wild emmer wheat (T. dicoccoides), which are highly tolerant to drought, hold a great potential. Prior to their introgression to modern wheat cultivars, drought related candidate genes are first characterized at the molecular level, and their function is confirmed via transgenic studies. After integration of the tolerance loci, specific environment targeted field trials are performed coupled with extensive analysis of morphological and physiological characteristics of developed cultivars, to assess their performance under drought conditions and their possible contributions to yield in certain regions. This paper focuses on recent advances on drought related gene/QTL identification, studies on drought related molecular pathways, and current efforts on improvement of wheat cultivars for drought tolerance."

"30429858","abstracttext","Eukaryotic type 2A protein phosphatases (protein phosphatase 2A, PP2A) consist of a scaffold subunit A, a regulatory subunit B, and a catalytic subunit C. Little is known about the roles of PP2Ac proteins that are involved in plant responses to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Sharp eyespot, caused by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis , is a destructive disease of wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), an important staple food crop. Here, we isolated TaPP2Ac-4D from wheat, which encodes a catalytic subunit of the heterotrimeric PP2A, and characterized its properties and role in plant defense response to R. cerealis . Based on the sequence alignment of TaPP2Ac-4D with the draft sequences of wheat chromosomes from the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC), it was found that TaPP2Ac-4D gene is located on the long arm of the wheat chromosome 4D and has two homologs assigned on wheat chromosomes 4A and 4B. Sequence and phylogenetic tree analyses revealed that the TaPP2Ac protein is a typical member of the PP2Ac family and belongs to the subfamily II. TaPP2Ac-4B and TaPP2Ac-4D displayed higher transcriptional levels in the R. cerealis -susceptible wheat cultivar Wenmai 6 than those seen in the resistant wheat line CI12633. The transcriptional levels of TaPP2Ac-4B and TaPP2Ac-4D were significantly elevated in wheat R. cerealis after infection and upon H 2 O 2 treatment. Virus-induced gene silencing results revealed that the transcriptional knockdown of TaPP2Ac-4D and TaPP2Ac-4B significantly increased wheat resistance to R. cerealis infection. Meanwhile, the transcriptional levels of certain pathogenesis-related (PR) and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging enzyme encoding genes were increased in TaPP2Ac- silenced wheat plants. These results suggest that TaPP2Ac-4B and TaPP2Ac-4D negatively regulate defense response to R. cerealis infection possibly through modulation of the expression of certain PR and ROS-scavenging enzyme genes in wheat. This study reveals a novel function of the plant PP2Ac genes in plant immune responses."

"17248593","abstracttext","Treatment with the antitubulin vinblastine was found to disrupt the spindle system in dividing root-tip cells of common wheat, Triticum aestivum L. Genotypes lacking the somatic association suppressor gene on 5B(L), or containing the somatic-association promoter on 5B(S), were found to be more sensitive to the treatment. In genetic lines carrying the somatic association suppressor, sensitivity to vinblastine was lower and there was a direct correlation between dosage of the suppressor gene (0, 2, and 4) and the decrease in spindle disruption on exposure to various concentrations of vinblastine. It is concluded that the somatic association genes affect binding ability of spindle tubulin to vinblastine. Since the same genes affect binding of colchicine to tubulin and since the two alkaloids attach to different sites it is assumed that the somatic association suppressor gene has a broad effect on the tubulin molecules which is not confined to a single site. The relevance of genetic control of antitubulin binding to somatic association is discussed."

"9049263","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) germin is a homopentameric glycoprotein whose synthesis is allied with seed germination. Germin pentamers show an unusual resistance to dissociation and possess an oxalate oxidase (OxO) activity. In order to increase our knowledge of germin gene expression, the function(s) of germin during development and possible uses in plant genetic engineering, an in vivo expression system is required. To this end, a gene for germin, named gf-2.8, was studied by expressing either promoter-GUS fusions or the intact gene in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants. Heterologous gene transcription was monitored in vitro and in vivo by GUS or OxO activity and was found to occur in developing seeds and in seedlings. This transcription was stimulated by auxins, as would be expected because of the presence of putative auxin-responsive elements in the promoter of the gf-2.8 gene. Auxin stimulation also extended to young leaves since OxO activity could be detected in treated but not in untreated leaves. The biochemical characteristics of wheat germin were also conserved in a transgenic host: the OxO activity was present under the form of a doublet co-migrating with germin G and G' isoforms. Also, germin distributed between a soluble and an apoplastic fractions despite the fact that wheat cell wall substantially differs from tobacco cell wall. Therefore, tobacco constitutes a suitable host for in vivo studies of this monocotyledon gene."

This gene was shown to be involved in early establishment of quantitative resistance to Fusarium Head Blight, a major disease of small-grain cereals. In the present work, using a translational biology approach, we identified and characterized a wheat candidate gene, Traes_2BS_14CA35D5D , orthologous to Bradi5g03300 on the short arm of chromosome 2B of bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L .). We showed that this UGT-encoding gene was highly inducible upon infection by a DON-producing Fusarium graminearum strain while not induced upon infection by a strain unable to produce DON. Transformation of this wheat UGT-encoding gene into B. distachyon revealed its ability to confer FHB resistance and root tolerance to DON as well as to potentially conjugate DON into D3G in planta and its impact on total DON reduction. In conclusion, we provide a UGT-encoding candidate gene to include in selection process for FHB resistance."

Three chromosome substitution lines, Ji806, Ji807, and Ji859, and two chromosome addition lines, Ji791 and Ji924, with a winter growing habit were developed from crosses between wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell.) and the wheat - Th. ponticum partial amphiploid line 693. These lines were resistant to leaf rust isolates from China. Sequence-tagged site (STS) analysis with the J09-STS marker, which is linked to the gene Lr24, revealed that the partial amphiploid line 693 and all of the substitution and addition lines carried gene Lr24. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis was carried out on chromosome preparations using total genomic DNA from Pseudoroegneria strigosa (M. Bieb) A. Löve (St genome, 2n = 14) as a probe in the presence of total genomic DNA from T. aestivum 'Chinese Spring' wheat (ABD genomes, 2n = 42). The GISH analysis demonstrated that these lines had a pair of chromosomes displaying the typical pattern of a Js genome chromosome. This indicates that the chromosome that carries gene Lr24 belonged to the Js genome of Th. ponticum. In addition to 40 wheat chromosomes, eight Js and eight J genome chromosomes were also differentiated by GISH in the partial amphiploid line 693. Since most sources of Lr24 have a red grain color, the white-colored seeds in all of these substitution and addition lines, together with high protein content in some of the lines, make them very useful as a donor source for winter wheat breeding programs."

"8025821","abstracttext","We have purified to homogeneity the 200 kDa protein induced specifically by low temperature in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The boiling solubility of the protein has been used as a main step in the purification procedure. Amino acid composition indicates that the 200 kDa has a compositional bias for glycine (11.4%), threonine (13.3%), and alanine (22.0%). Using oligonucleotide probes, we have isolated a clone (p Wcs200) from a cold-acclimated winter wheat cDNA library. Northern analysis demonstrated that the expression of the corresponding gene was specifically upregulated by low temperature. Southern analysis showed that the gene organization and the relative copy number were identical in two cultivars differing in their capacity to develop freezing tolerance. Protein sequence and immunological analyses indicate that this protein shares similar features with the 50 kDa protein induced during cold acclimation of wheat. The two proteins are boiling-soluble, and possess similar repeated elements. These elements may be important for the development of freezing tolerance. We have shown that the 200 kDa protein is the largest member of a family of immunologically-related cold-induced proteins in wheat. Expression of pWcs200 in E. coli yielded a product of around 200 kDa, indicating that the clone contains most of the coding region for this protein."

"10202814","abstracttext","In suspension-cultured cells of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chihokukomugi), the accumulation of soluble secretory proteins in the culture medium was promoted by ABA treatment in comparison with non-treated cells. The total amount of secretory proteins in ABA-treated cells was 1.7-fold higher than that in non-treated cells. The analysis of two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that at least twelve secretory proteins were induced by ABA, and these were named WAS (wheat ABA-induced secretory) proteins 1 to 12. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of WAS proteins revealed the sequences of WAS-2 and WAS-3. Homology searches showed that WAS-2 had 55% identity with the N-terminus of the wheat chemically induced gene (WCI-5 gene) product. WAS-3 was also shown to have 93% identity with the N-terminus of the barley protein R, a typical member of thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs). Immunoblot analysis also suggested that WAS-3 was related to protein R. These results suggest that exogenous ABA induces some basic secretory proteins that are related to the plant defense system in wheat."

"19005709","abstracttext","Glycosyltransferases (GTs) constitute a very large multi-gene superfamily, containing several thousand members identified in sequenced organisms especially in plants. GTs are key enzymes involved in various biological processes such as cell wall formation, storage polysaccharides biosynthesis, and glycosylation of various metabolites. GTs have been identified in rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis thaliana, but their precise function has been demonstrated biochemically for only a few. In this work we have established a repertoire of virtually all the wheat (Triticum aestivum) GT sequences, using the large publicly available banks of expressed sequences. Based on sequence similarity with Arabidopsis and rice GTs compiled in the carbohydrate active enzyme database (CAZY), we have identified and classified these wheat sequences. The results were used to feed a searchable database available on the web ( http://wwwappli.nantes.inra.fr:8180/GTIDB ) that can be used for initiating an exhaustive candidate gene survey in wheat applied to a particular biological process. This is illustrated through the identification of GT families which are expressed during cell wall formation in wheat grain maturation."

"17110991","abstracttext","The original blue-grained wheat, Blue 58, was a substitution line derived from hybridization between common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n=6x=42, ABD) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum Liu & Wang=Agropyron elongatum, 2n=10x=70, StStEeEbEx), in which one pair of 4D chromosomes was replaced by a pair of alien 4Ag chromosomes (unknown group 4 chromosome from A. ponticum). Blue aleurone might be a useful cytological marker in chromosome engineering and wheat breeding. Cytogenetic analysis showed that blue aleurone was controlled by chromosome 4Ag. GISH analysis proved that the 4Ag was a recombination chromosome; its centromeric and pericentromeric regions were from an E-genome chromosome, but the distal regions of its two arms were from an St-genome chromosome. On its short arm, there was a major pAs1 hybridization band, which was very close to the centromere. GISH and FISH analysis in a set of translocation lines with different seed colors revealed that the gene(s) controlling the blue pigment was located on the long arm of 4Ag. It was physically mapped to the 0.71-0.80 regions (distance measured from the centromere of 4Ag). The blue color is a consequence of dosage of this small chromosome region derived from the St genome. We speculate that the blue-grained gene(s) could activate the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway of wheat."

"19821052","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici is one of the main diseases of wheat worldwide. Wheat mutant line D51, which was derived from the highly susceptible cultivar L6239, shows resistance to the prevailing races 21C3CPH, 21C3CKH, and 21C3CTR of P. graminis f. sp. tritici in China. In this study, we used the cDNA-AFLP technology to identify the genes that are likely involved in the stem rust resistance. EcoRI/MseI selective primers were used to generate approximately 1920 DNA fragments. Seventy five differentially transcribed fragments (3.91%) were identified by comparing the samples of 21C3CPH infected D51 with infected L6239 or uninfected D51. Eleven amplified cDNA fragments were sequenced. Eight showed significant similarity to known genes, including TaLr1 (leaf rust resistance gene), wlm24 (wheat powdery mildew resistance gene), stress response genes and ESTs of environment stress of tall fescue. These identified genes are involved in plant defense response and stem rust resistance and need further research to determine their usefulness in breeding new resistance cultivars."

"23641183","abstracttext","Leymus mollis (Triticeae; Poaceae) is a useful genetic resource for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding via wide hybridization to introduce its chromosomes and integrate its useful traits into wheat. Leymus mollis is highly tolerant to abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity and resistant to various diseases, but the genetic mechanisms controlling its physiological tolerance remain largely unexplored. We identified and cloned an allene oxide cyclase (AOC) gene from L. mollis that was strongly expressed under salt stress. AOC is involved in biosynthesis of jasmonic acid, an important signaling compound that mediates a wide range of adaptive responses. LmAOC cDNA consisted of 717 bp, coding for a protein with 238 amino acids that was highly similar to AOCs from barley (Hordeum vulgare) and other monocots. Subcellular localization using Nicotiana benthamiana confirmed it as a chloroplast-localized protein. LmAOC was found to be a multiple-copy gene, and that some copies were conserved and efficiently expressed in wheat-Leymus chromosome addition lines. LmAOC expression was upregulated under drought, heat, cold and wounding stresses, and by jasmonic acid and abscisic acid. Our results suggest that LmAOC plays an important role in L. mollis adaptation to abiotic stresses and it could be useful for wheat improvement."

"25326302","abstracttext","Parastagonospora nodorum is a pathogen of wheat that affects yields globally. Previous transcriptional analysis identified a partially reducing polyketide synthase (PR-PKS) gene, SNOG_00477 (SN477), in P. nodorum that is highly upregulated during infection of wheat leaves. Disruption of the corresponding SN477 gene resulted in the loss of production of two compounds, which we identified as (R)-mellein and (R)-O-methylmellein. Using a Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast heterologous expression system, we successfully demonstrated that SN477 is the only enzyme required for the production of (R)-mellein. This is the first identification of a fungal PKS that is responsible for the synthesis of (R)-mellein. The P. nodorum ΔSN477 mutant did not show any significant difference from the wild-type strain in its virulence against wheat. However, (R)-mellein at 200 μg/ml inhibited the germination of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seeds. Comparative sequence analysis identified the presence of mellein synthase (MLNS) homologues in several Dothideomycetes and two sodariomycete genera. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the MLNSs in fungi and bacteria evolved convergently from fungal and bacterial 6-methylsalicylic acid synthases."

"25180085","abstracttext","MicroRNAs are endogenous small noncoding RNAs which play critical roles in gene regulation. Few wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) miRNA sequences are available in miRBase repertoire and knowledge of their biological functions related to biotic stress is limited. We identified 52 miRNAs, belonging to 19 families, from next-generation transcriptome sequence data based on homology search. One wheat specific novel miRNA was identified but could not be ascribed or assigned to any known miRNA family. Differentially expressed 22 miRNAs were found between susceptible and resistant wheat near-isogenic lines inoculated with leaf rust pathogen Puccinia triticina and compared with mock inoculated controls. Most miRNAs were more upregulated in susceptible NIL compared to resistant NIL. We identified 1306 potential target genes for these 52 miRNAs with vital roles in response to stimuli, signaling, and diverse metabolic and cellular processes. Gene ontology analysis showed 66, 20, and 35 target genes to be categorized into biological process, molecular function, and cellular component, respectively. A miRNA-mediated regulatory network revealed relationships among the components of the targetome. The present study provides insight into potential miRNAs with probable roles in leaf rust pathogenesis and their target genes in wheat which establish a foundation for future studies."

"27555860","abstracttext","AP2/EREBPs play significant roles in plant growth and development. A novel, pleiotropic TaPARG (PLANT ARCHITECTURE-RELATED GENE), a member of the AP2/EREBP transcription factor gene family, and its flanking sequences were isolated in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Two TaPARG genes were identified and named as TaPARG-2A and TaPARG-2D. Their amino acid sequences were highly similar especially in the functional domains. TaPARG-2A on chromosome 2A was flanked by markers Xwmc63 and Xgwm372. TaPARG-2D was mapped to chromosome 2D. Subcellular localization revealed that TaPARG-2D was localized in the nucleus. The results of tissue expression pattern, overexpression in rice, association analysis and distinct population verification jointly revealed that TaPARG functions during the entire growth cycle of wheat. Its functions include regulation of plant architecture-related and yield-related traits. Association analysis, geographic distribution and allelic frequencies suggested that favored haplotypes Hap-2A-2 and Hap-2A-3 were selected in Chinese wheat breeding programs. Both favored haplotypes might be caused by a single amino acid substitution (His/Tyr). These results suggest that TaPARG is a regulatory factor in plant growth and development, and that the favored alleles might be useful for improving plant architecture and grain yield of wheat."

"29545269","abstracttext","Semidwarfing genes have improved crop yield by reducing height, improving lodging resistance, and allowing plants to allocate more assimilates to grain growth. In wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), the Rht18 semidwarfing gene was identified and deployed in durum wheat before it was transferred into bread wheat, where it was shown to have agronomic potential. Rht18 , a dominant and gibberellin (GA) responsive mutant, is genetically and functionally distinct from the widely used GA-insensitive semidwarfing genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b In this study, the Rht18 gene was identified by mutagenizing the semidwarf durum cultivar Icaro ( Rht18 ) and generating mutants with a range of tall phenotypes. Isolating and sequencing chromosome 6A of these ""overgrowth"" mutants showed that they contained independent mutations in the coding region of GA2oxA9 GA2oxA9 is predicted to encode a GA 2-oxidase that metabolizes GA biosynthetic intermediates into inactive products, effectively reducing the amount of bioactive GA (GA 1 ). Functional analysis of the GA2oxA9 protein demonstrated that GA2oxA9 converts the intermediate GA 12 to the inactive metabolite GA 110 Furthermore, Rht18 showed higher expression of GA2oxA9 and lower GA content compared with its tall parent. These data indicate that the increased expression of GA2oxA9 in Rht18 results in a reduction of both bioactive GA content and plant height. This study describes a height-reducing mechanism that can generate new genetic diversity for semidwarfism in wheat by combining increased expression with mutations of specific amino acid residues in GA2oxA9 ."

"28904403","abstracttext","The currently favoured method for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) transformation is inapplicable to many elite cultivars because it requires callus culture and regeneration. Here, we developed a simple, reproducible, in planta wheat transformation method using biolistic DNA delivery without callus culture or regeneration. Shoot apical meristems (SAMs) grown from dry imbibed seeds were exposed under a microscope and subjected to bombardment with different-sized gold particles coated with the GFP gene construct, introducing DNA into the L2 cell layer. Bombarded embryos were grown to mature, stably transformed T 0 plants and integration of the GFP gene into the genome was determined at the fifth leaf. Use of 0.6-µm particles and 1350-psi pressure resulted in dramatically increased maximum ratios of transient GFP expression in SAMs and transgene integration in the fifth leaf. The transgene was integrated into the germ cells of 62% of transformants, and was therefore inherited in the next generation. We successfully transformed the model wheat cultivar 'Fielder', as well as the recalcitrant Japanese elite cultivar 'Haruyokoi'. Our method could potentially be used to generate stable transgenic lines for a wide range of commercial wheat cultivars."

The P. tritici-repentis isolate M4 was also RNA sequenced to capture gene expression in vitro at two different growth stages: 7-day old vegetative mycelia and 9-day old sporulating mycelia, to coincide with a latent growth stage and early sporulation respectively. In total, 6 RNA datasets are available to aid in the validation of predicted genes of P. tritici-repentis and wheat. The datasets generated offer an insight into the transcriptomic profile of the host-pathogen interaction and can be used to investigate the expression of a subset of transcripts or targeted genes prior to designing cost-intensive RNA sequencing experiments, that would be best further explored with replication and a time series analysis."

"30754772","abstracttext"," Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) transformation via particle bombardment is now established in many laboratories, but transformation efficiencies are still largely low and the highest efficiencies can only be obtained with certain genotypes. For rapid optimization and improvement of wheat transformation protocols, a non-destructive marker which permits early detection of transformed cells is needed. We have assessed the ability of a modified version of the Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) to act as a marker for detecting transformed cells and tissues of wheat. Multicellular clusters emitting green fluorescence were observed 14 days after particle bombardment with a sGFPS65T gene construct, and gfp-expressing shoots (often with expressing roots) could be observed as early as 21 days after bombardment. These shoots can be removed from the callus and grown further until they are ready to transfer to soil. Transgenic wheat plants could be selected on the basis of gfp expression alone although the inclusion of antibiotic resistance as a selectable marker could improve the efficiency. Using sgfpS65T as a marker gene in an experiment comparing bombardment parameters allowed the rapid identification of variables that could be targeted for optimization."

It is a rich reservoir of useful genes for biotic and abiotic stress tolerance for wheat improvement. We developed a TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genomes) resource for Ae. tauschii for discovery and validation of useful genes in the D genome of wheat. The population, referred to as TILL-D, was developed with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagen. The survival rate in M 1 generation was 73%, out of which 22% plants were sterile. In the M 2 generation 25% of the planted seeds showed phenotypic mutations such as albinos, chlorinas, no germination, variegated, sterile and partially fertile events, and 2,656 produced fertile M 2 plants. The waxy gene was used to calculate the mutation frequency (1/70 kb) of the developed population, which was found to be higher than known mutation frequencies for diploid plants (1/89-1/1000 kb), but lower than that for a polyploid species (1/24-1/51 kb). The TILL-D resource, together with the newly published Ae. tauschii reference genome sequence, will facilitate gene discoveries and validations of agronomically important traits and their eventual fine transfer in bread wheat."

"32111029","abstracttext","The WUSCHEL-related homeobox (WOX) is a family of plant-specific transcription factors, with important functions, such as regulating the dynamic balance of division and differentiation of plant stem cells and plant organ development. We identified 14 distinct TaWOX genes in the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome, based on a genome-wide scan approach. All of the genes under evaluation had positional homoeologs on subgenomes A, B and D except TaWUS and TaWOX14. Both Ta WOX 14a and Ta WOX 14 d had a paralogous copy on the same genome due to tandem duplication events. A phylogenetic analysis revealed that TaWOX genes could be divided into three groups. We performed functional characterization of TaWOX genes based on the evolutionary relationships among the WOX gene families of wheat, rice (Oryza sativa L.), and Arabidopsis. An overexpression analysis of TaWUS in Arabidopsis revealed that it affected the development of outer floral whorl organs. The overexpression analysis of TaWOX9 in Arabidopsis revealed that it promoted the root development. In addition, we identified some interaction between the TaWUS and TaWOX9 proteins by screening wheat cDNA expression libraries, which informed directions for further research to determine the functions of TaWUS and TaWOX9. This study represents the first comprehensive data on members of the WOX gene family in wheat."

The presence of genes was analyzed in one winter wheat variety TX89D6435 and five spring wheat varieties: Pavon F76, Parula 'S', Rayon 89, Kern, Mochis 88. Both Lr34 and Lr46 genes were identified in variety TX89D6435, gene Lr34 was also identified in Parula 'S' and Kern varieties, and gene L46 occurs in Pavon F76 and Mochis 88 variety. None of the resistance genes tested was detected in the Rayon 89 variety. The use of the multiplex PCR method allowed to shorten the analysis time, reduce costs of analyses, and reduce the workload."

"32689277","abstracttext","Polyphenol oxidases (PPOs) have been implicated in plant defence reactions. From an applied point of view, high PPO activity is associated with browning / darkening of fresh and processed food. Owing to its complex genome and economic importance, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) represents an interesting system to advance our understanding of plant PPO function. We have previously shown that wheat PPOs are organised in a multigene family, consisting of two distinct phylogenetic clusters with three members each. In this study, we demonstrate that members of one cluster are not expressed in developing kernels or senescing flag leaves. Transcriptional regulation of one major gene in the other cluster largely controls PPO levels in these tissues, at least in the wheat varieties used for this study. Our data further indicate that the product of this gene is present as a latent enzyme during early kernel development, and that the latent enzyme is activated during later developmental phases. Enzyme activation can be achieved in vitro by limited tryptic digestion, but our data do not indicate activation by a proteolytic mechanism in vivo. Together, results presented in this study provide important insights into the regulation of wheat PPO function."

"21265893","abstracttext","The Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) disease resistance gene Lr34 confers durable, race non-specific protection against three fungal pathogens, and has been a highly relevant gene for wheat breeding since the green revolution. Lr34, located on chromosome 7D, encodes an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter. Both wheat cultivars with and without Lr34-based resistance encode a putatively functional protein that differ by only two amino acid polymorphisms. In this study, we focused on the identification and characterization of homoeologous and orthologous Lr34 genes in hexaploid wheat and other grasses. In hexaploid wheat we found an expressed and putatively functional Lr34 homoeolog located on chromosome 4A, designated Lr34-B. Another homoeologous Lr34 copy, located on chromosome 7A, was disrupted by the insertion of repetitive elements. Protein sequences of LR34-B and LR34 were 97% identical. Orthologous Lr34 genes were detected in the genomes of Oryza sativa (rice) and Sorghum bicolor (sorghum). Zea mays (maize), Brachypodium distachyon and Hordeum vulgare (barley) lacked Lr34 orthologs, indicating independent deletion of this particular ABC transporter. Lr34 was part of a gene-rich island on the wheat D genome. We found gene colinearity on the homoeologous A and B genomes of hexaploid wheat, but little microcolinearity in other grasses. The homoeologous LR34-B protein and the orthologs from rice and sorghum have the susceptible haplotype for the two critical polymorphisms distinguishing the LR34 proteins from susceptible and resistant wheat cultivars. We conclude that the particular Lr34-haplotype found in resistant wheat cultivars is unique. It probably resulted from functional gene diversification that occurred after the polyploidization event that was at the origin of cultivated bread wheat."
"26616759","articletitle","Homoeologous copy-specific expression patterns of MADS-box genes for floral formation in allopolyploid wheat."
"26616759","abstracttext","The consensus model for floral organ formation in higher plants, the so-called ABCDE model, proposes that floral whorl-specific combinations of class A, B, C, D, and E genes specify floral organ identity. Class A, B, C, D and E genes encode MADS-box transcription factors; the single exception being the class A gene APETALA2. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is a hexaploid species with a genome constitution AABBDD; the hexaploid originated from a cross between tetraploid T. turgidum (AABB) and diploid Aegilops tauschii (DD). Tetraploid wheat is thought to have originated from a cross between the diploid species T. urartu (AA) and Ae. speltoides (BB). Consequently, the hexaploid wheat genome contains triplicated homoeologous copies (homoeologs) of each gene derived from the different ancestral diploid species. In this study, we examined the expression patterns of homoeologs of class B, C and D MADS-box genes during floral development. For the class B gene wheat PISTILLATA2 (WPI2), the homoeologs from the A and D genomes were expressed, while expression of the B genome homoeolog was suppressed. For the class C gene wheat AGAMOUS1 (WAG1), the homoeologs on the A and B genomes were expressed, while expression of the D genome homoeolog was suppressed. For the class D gene wheat SEEDSTICK (WSTK), the B genome homoeolog was preferentially expressed. These differential patterns of homoeolog expression were consistently observed among different hexaploid wheat varieties and synthetic hexaploid wheat lines developed by artificial crosses between tetraploid wheat and Ae. tauschii. These results suggest that homoeolog-specific regulation of the floral MADS-box genes occurs in allopolyploid wheat."

The LC values of imidacloprid against aphid spp., ISSR-PCR molecular markers and biochemical parameters in wheat plant in the present study were carried out. The LC 50 of imidacloprid on Rhopalosiphum maidis, Rhopalosiphum padi, Sitobion avenae, and Schzaphis graminum were 71.626, 85.853, 91.05, and 115.806, respectively. While, the biochemical parameters in treated wheat plants including; total protein, RNA, and DNA contents increased in all experimental groups. Moreover, total carbohydrates and soluble sugar also increased in treated wheat seedlings. Also, the genetic diversity studies revealed that among six ISSR primers produced 36 amplified DNA fragments in a molecular weight range of (480-1545 bp). About 28 fragments were monomorphic, and 8 fragments were polymorphic. It can be concluded that the effectiveness of imidacloprid against sucking insects in treated wheat plants may due to few genetic variations and some metabolic changes in the Triticum. aestivum. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The current study indicated that the potent efficacy of imidacloprid against different aphid spp. which were the most insect pest in wheat plants. As well as the application of imidacloprid as seed dressing insecticide, significantly increase carbohydrate, protein, amino acids, and RNA content in T. aestivum plants. While there was no significant increase in DNA in treated one. The recorded increase in these biochemical parameters may due to the increase in the gene expressions as a result of the application of such pesticides. These results explain the extra mechanism of the effect of imidacloprid against sucking insects. Also, the conducted results explain the effect of imidacloprid as a seed dressing insecticide in wheat crop protection from sucking insects and increasing seed germination, increasing seed wheat and number of seeds/spike."

"25205575","abstracttext","As food crop, wheat is of prime importance for human society. Nevertheless, our understanding of the genetic and molecular mechanisms controlling wheat productivity conditions has been, so far, hampered by the lack of sufficient genomic resources. The present work describes the isolation and characterization of TdERF1, an ERF gene from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum). The structural features of TdERF1 supported the hypothesis that it is a novel member of the ERF family in durum wheat and, considering its close similarity to TaERF1 of Triticum aestivum, it probably plays a similar role in mediating responses to environmental stresses. TdERF1 displayed an expression pattern that discriminated between two durum wheat genotypes contrasted with regard to salt-stress tolerance. The high number of cis-regulatory elements related to stress responses present in the TdERF1 promoter and the ability of TdERF1 to regulate the transcription of ethylene and drought-responsive promoters clearly indicated its potential role in mediating plant responses to a wide variety of environmental constrains. TdERF1 was also regulated by abscisic acid, ethylene, auxin, and salicylic acid, suggesting that it may be at the crossroads of multiple hormone signalling pathways. Four TdERF1 allelic variants have been identified in durum wheat genome, all shown to be transcriptionally active. Interestingly, the expression of one allelic form is specific to the tolerant genotype, further supporting the hypothesis that this gene is probably associated with the susceptibility/tolerance mechanism to salt stress. In this regard, the TdERF1 gene may provide a discriminating marker between tolerant and sensitive wheat varieties."

"12226515","abstracttext","Glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene expression was examined in several Triticum species, differing in genome constitution and ploidy level, to determine genome contribution to GST expression in cultivated, hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Two tandemly duplicated tau class GST genes (TtGSTU1 and TtGSTU2) were isolated from a single bacterial artificial chromosome clone in a library constructed from the diploid wheat and D genome progenitor to cultivated wheat, Triticum tauschii. The genes are very similar in genomic structure and their encoded proteins are 95% identical. Gene-specific reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed differential transcript accumulation of TtGSTU1 and TtGSTU2 in roots and shoots. Expression of both genes was induced by herbicide safeners, 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and abscisic acid, in the shoots of T. tauschii; however, expression of TtGSTU1 was always higher than TtGSTU2. In untreated seedlings, TtGSTU1 was expressed in both shoots and roots, whereas TtGSTU2 expression was only detected in roots. RNA gel-blot analysis of ditelosomic, aneuploid lines that are deficient for 6AS, 6BS, or 6DS chromosome arms of cultivated, hexaploid bread wheat showed differential genome contribution to safener-induced GST expression in shoots compared with roots. The GST genes from the D genome of hexaploid wheat contribute most to safener-induced expression in the shoots, whereas GSTs from the B and D genomes contribute to safener-induced expression in the roots."

"27032785","abstracttext","MicroRNAs are critical players of post-transcriptional gene regulation with profound effects on the fundamental processes of cellular life. Their identification and characterization, together with their targets, hold great significance in exploring and exploiting their roles on a functional context, providing valuable clues into the regulation of important biological processes, such as stress tolerance or environmental adaptation. Wheat is a hardy crop, extensively harvested in temperate regions, and is a major component of the human diet. With the advent of the next generation sequencing technologies considerably decreasing sequencing costs per base-pair, genomic, and transcriptomic data from several wheat species, including the progenitors and wild relatives have become available. In this study, we performed in silico identification and comparative analysis of microRNA repertoires of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its diploid progenitors and relatives, Aegilops sharonensis, Aegilops speltoides, Aegilops tauschii, Triticum monococcum, and Triticum urartu through the utilization of publicly available transcriptomic data. Over 200 miRNA families were identified, majority of which have not previously been reported. Ancestral relationships expanded our understanding of wheat miRNA evolution, while T. monococcum miRNAs delivered important clues on the effects of domestication on miRNA expression. Comparative analyses on wild Ae. sharonensis accessions highlighted candidate miRNAs that can be linked to stress tolerance. The miRNA repertoires of bread wheat and its diploid progenitors and relatives provide important insight into the diversification and distribution of miRNA genes, which should contribute to the elucidation of miRNA evolution of Poaceae family. A thorough understanding of the convergent and divergent expression profiles of miRNAs in different genetic backgrounds can provide unique opportunities to modulation of gene regulation for better crop performance."

"27200073","abstracttext","As the post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, microRNAs or miRNAs comprise an integral part of understanding how genomes function. Although miRNAs have been a major focus of recent efforts, miRNA research is still in its infancy in most plant species. Aegilops tauschii, the D genome progenitor of bread wheat, is a wild diploid grass exhibiting remarkable population diversity. Due to the direct ancestry and the diverse gene pool, A. tauschii is a promising source for bread wheat improvement. In this study, a total of 87 Aegilops miRNA families, including 51 previously unknown, were computationally identified both at the subgenomic level, using flow-sorted A. tauschii 5D chromosome, and at the whole genome level. Predictions at the genomic and subgenomic levels suggested A. tauschii 5D chromosome as rich in pre-miRNAs that are highly associated with Class II DNA transposons. In order to gain insights into miRNA evolution, putative 5D chromosome miRNAs were compared to its modern ortholog, Triticum aestivum 5D chromosome, revealing that 48 of the 58 A. tauschii 5D miRNAs were conserved in orthologous T. aestivum 5D chromosome. The expression profiles of selected miRNAs (miR167, miR5205, miR5175, miR5523) provided the first experimental evidence for miR5175, miR5205 and miR5523, and revealed differential expressional changes in response to drought in different genetic backgrounds for miR167 and miR5175. Interestingly, while miR5523 coding regions were present and expressed as pre-miR5523 in both T. aestivum and A. tauschii, the expression of mature miR5523 was observed only in A. tauschii under normal conditions, pointing out to an interference at the downstream processing of pre-miR5523 in T. aestivum. Overall, this study expands our knowledge on the miRNA catalog of A. tauschii, locating a subset specifically to the 5D chromosome, with ample functional and comparative insight which should contribute to and complement efforts to develop drought tolerant wheat varieties."

"24270565","abstracttext","Anthers from three sets of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) F1's and their reciprocal crosses, made between parental lines differing greatly in their ability to produce microspore derived callus, were cultured on the Chinese potato medium so that we could 1) more clearly define the role of nuclear or cytoplasmic factors within T. aestivum in transferring the ability to undergo in vitro androgenesis, and 2) to briefly review the gametic representation and disease screening potential of the resulting polyhaploid wheat plants. The microspore derived calli values from F1's were slightly less than the midparental value. Statistical analysis indicated that the ability of each F1 to produce callus either did not significantly differ from that of the respective parental line having the highest androgenic yield or it exceeded its respective parental line having the lowest yield. No differences were noted between the members of each pair of reciprocal crosses. The results indicate that the transfer of in vitro androgenic ability to F1 hybrids is not dependent upon the maternal cytoplasm source. Polyhaploid plants, carrying the Pm 3 a powdery mildew resistance gene, expressed resistance to culture 4 a of powdery mildew."

To determine inheritance of stripe rust resistance and map the resistance gene(s) in wheat variety C591, F(1), F(2,) and F(3) progenies derived from the Taichung 29 x C591 cross were inoculated with Chinese PST race CY32 in the greenhouse. Genetic analysis identified a single dominant gene, temporarily designated YrC591. A total of 178 SSR and 130 AFLP markers were used to test the parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. From the bulk segregant analysis, seven polymorphic SSR and two AFLP markers were selected for genotyping the F(2) population. SSR marker Xcfa2040-7B, and SCAR marker SC-P35M48 derived from AFLP marker P35M48 ( 373 ) were identified to be closely linked to the resistance gene with genetic distances of 8.0 and 11.7 cM, respectively. The SSR markers mapped the resistance gene on chromosome arm 7BL. In the seedling test with five PST races, the reaction patterns of C591 were different from wheat cultivars or lines carrying Yr2 or Yr6 that also are found on chromosome 7B. The results indicate that YrC591 is probably a novel stripe rust resistance gene."
"23904183","articletitle","A review of the occurrence of Grain softness protein-1 genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"23904183","abstracttext","Grain softness protein-1 (Gsp-1) is a small, 495-bp intronless gene found throughout the Triticeae tribe at the distal end of group 5 chromosomes. With the Puroindolines, it constitutes a key component of the Hardness locus. Gsp-1 likely plays little role in grain hardness, but has direct interest due to its utility in phylogeny and its role in arabinogalactan peptides. Further role(s) remain to be identified. In the polyploid wheats, Triticum aestivum and T. turgidum, the gene is present in a homoeologous series. Since its discovery, there have been conflicting reports and data as to the number of Gsp-1 genes and the level of sequence polymorphism. Little is known about allelic variation within a species. In the simplest model, a single Gsp-1 gene is present in each wheat and Aegilops tauschii genome. The present review critically re-examines the published and some unpublished data (sequence available in the NCBI nucleotide and MIPS Wheat Genome Databases). A number of testable hypotheses are identified, and include the level of polymorphism that may represent (and define) different Gsp-1 alleles, the existence of a fourth Gsp-1 gene, and the apparent, at times, high level of naturally-occurring or artifactual gene chimeras. In summary, the present data provide firm evidence for at most, three Gsp-1 genes in wheat, although there are numerous data that suggest a more complex model."

"27510270","abstracttext","The capacity of the bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome to tolerate introgression from related genomes can be exploited for wheat improvement. A resistance to powdery mildew expressed by a derivative of the cross-bread wheat cv. Tähti × T. militinae (Tm) is known to be due to the incorporation of a Tm segment into the long arm of chromosome 4A. Here, a newly developed in silico method termed rearrangement identification and characterization (RICh) has been applied to characterize the introgression. A virtual gene order, assembled using the GenomeZipper approach, was obtained for the native copy of chromosome 4A; it incorporated 570 4A DArTseq markers to produce a zipper comprising 2132 loci. A comparison between the native and introgressed forms of the 4AL chromosome arm showed that the introgressed region is located at the distal part of the arm. The Tm segment, derived from chromosome 7G, harbours 131 homoeologs of the 357 genes present on the corresponding region of Chinese Spring 4AL. The estimated number of Tm genes transferred along with the disease resistance gene was 169. Characterizing the introgression's position, gene content and internal gene order should not only facilitate gene isolation, but may also be informative with respect to chromatin structure and behaviour studies."

Our objective was to characterize the complete nsLtp gene family in rice and arabidopsis and to perform wheat EST database mining for nsLtp gene discovery."
"18291034","abstracttext_results","In this study, we carried out a genome-wide analysis of nsLtp gene families in Oryza sativa and Arabidopsis thaliana and identified 52 rice nsLtp genes and 49 arabidopsis nsLtp genes. Here we present a complete overview of the genes and deduced protein features. Tandem duplication repeats, which represent 26 out of the 52 rice nsLtp genes and 18 out of the 49 arabidopsis nsLtp genes identified, support the complexity of the nsLtp gene families in these species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that rice and arabidopsis nsLTPs are clustered in nine different clades. In addition, we performed comparative analysis of rice nsLtp genes and wheat (Triticum aestivum) EST sequences indexed in the UniGene database. We identified 156 putative wheat nsLtp genes, among which 91 were found in the 'Chinese Spring' cultivar. The 122 wheat non-redundant nsLTPs were organized in eight types and 33 subfamilies. Based on the observation that seven of these clades were present in arabidopsis, rice and wheat, we conclude that the major functional diversification within the nsLTP family predated the monocot/dicot divergence. In contrast, there is no type VII nsLTPs in arabidopsis and type IX nsLTPs were only identified in arabidopsis. The reason for the larger number of nsLtp genes in wheat may simply be due to the hexaploid state of wheat but may also reflect extensive duplication of gene clusters as observed on rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and arabidopsis chromosome 5."
"18291034","abstracttext_conclusion","Our current study provides fundamental information on the organization of the rice, arabidopsis and wheat nsLtp gene families. The multiplicity of nsLTP types provide new insights on arabidopsis, rice and wheat nsLtp gene families and will strongly support further transcript profiling or functional analyses of nsLtp genes. Until such time as specific physiological functions are defined, it seems relevant to categorize plant nsLTPs on the basis of sequence similarity and/or phylogenetic clustering."
"32480809","articletitle","Genome-level identification of cell wall invertase genes in wheat for the study of drought tolerance."
"32480809","abstracttext","In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) drought-induced pollen sterility is a major contributor to grain yield loss and is caused by the downregulation of the cell wall invertase gene IVR1. The IVR1 gene catalyses the irreversible hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose, the essential energy substrates which support pollen development. Downregulation of IVR1 in response to drought is isoform specific and shows variation in temporal and tissue-specific expression. IVR1 is now prompting interest as a candidate gene for molecular marker development to screen wheat germplasm for improved drought tolerance. The aim of this study was to define the family of IVR1 genes to enable: (1) individual isoforms to be assayed in gene expression studies; and (2) greater accuracy in IVR1 mapping to the wheat genetic map and drought tolerance QTL analysis. Using a cell wall invertase-specific motif as a probe, wheat genomics platforms were screened for the presence of unidentified IVR1 isoforms. Wheat genomics platforms screened included the IWGSC wheat survey sequence, the wheat D genome donor sequence from Aegilops tauschii Coss, and the CCG wheat chromosome 3B assembly: contig506. Chromosome-specific sequences homologous to the query motif were isolated and characterised. Sequence annotation results showed five previously unidentified IVR1 isoforms exist on multiple chromosome arms and on all three genomes (A, B and D): IVR1-3A, IVR1-4A, IVR1-5B, IVR1.2-3B and IVR1-5D. Including three previously characterised IVR1 isoforms (IVR1.1-1A, IVR1.2-1A and IVR1.1-3B), the total number of isoform gene family members is eight. The IVR1 isoforms contain two motifs common to cell wall invertase (NDPN and WECPDF) and a high degree of conservation in exon 4, suggesting conservation of functionality. Sequence divergence at a primary structure level in other regions of the gene was evident amongst the isoforms, which likely contributes to variation in gene regulation and expression in response to water deficit within this subfamily of IVR1 isoforms in wheat."
"12119408","articletitle","Transcripts of Vp-1 homeologues are misspliced in modern wheat and ancestral species."
"12119408","abstracttext","The maize (Zea mays) Viviparous 1 (Vp1) transcription factor has been shown previously to be a major regulator of seed development, simultaneously activating embryo maturation and repressing germination. Hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) caryopses are characterized by relatively weak embryo dormancy and are susceptible to preharvest sprouting (PHS), a phenomenon that is phenotypically similar to the maize vp1 mutation. Analysis of Vp-1 transcript structure in wheat embryos during grain development showed that each homeologue produces cytoplasmic mRNAs of different sizes. The majority of transcripts are spliced incorrectly, contain insertions of intron sequences or deletions of coding region, and do not have the capacity to encode full-length proteins. Several VP-1-related lower molecular weight protein species were present in wheat embryo nuclei. Embryos of a closely related tetraploid species (Triticum turgidum) and ancestral diploids also contained misspliced Vp-1 transcripts that were structurally similar or identical to those found in modern hexaploid wheat, which suggests that compromised structure and expression of Vp-1 transcripts in modern wheat are inherited from ancestral species. Developing embryos from transgenic wheat grains expressing the Avena fatua Vp1 gene showed enhanced responsiveness to applied abscisic acid compared with the control. In addition, ripening ears of transgenic plants were less susceptible to PHS. Our results suggest that missplicing of wheat Vp-1 genes contributes to susceptibility to PHS in modern hexaploid wheat varieties and identifies a possible route to increase resistance to this environmentally triggered disorder."

"16034582","abstracttext","The increasing availability of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and related cereals provides a valuable resource of non-anonymous DNA molecular markers. In this study, 300 primer pairs were designed from 265 wheat ESTs that contain microsatellites in order to develop new markers for wheat. Their level of transferability in eight related species [Triticum durum, T. monococcum, Aegilops speltoides, Ae. tauschii, rye (Secale cereale), barley (Hordeum vulgare), Agropyron elongatum and rice (Oryza sativa)] was assessed. In total, 240 primer pairs (80%) gave an amplification product on wheat, and 177 were assigned to wheat chromosomes using aneuploid lines. Transferability to closely related Triticeae species ranged from 76.7% for Ae. tauschii to 90.4% for T. durum and was lower for more distant relatives such as barley (50.4%) or rice (28.3%). No clear putative function could be assigned to the genes from which the simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were developed, even though most of them were located inside ORFs. BLAST: analysis of the EST sequences against the 12 rice pseudo-molecules showed that the EST-SSRs are mainly located in the telomeric regions and that the wheat ESTs have the highest similarity to genes on rice chromosomes 2, 3 and 5. Interestingly, most of the SSRs giving an amplification product on barley or rice had a repeated motif similar to the one found in wheat, suggesting a common ancestral origin. Our results indicate that wheat EST-SSRs show a high level of transferability across distantly related species, thereby providing additional markers for comparative mapping and for following gene introgressions from wild species and carrying out evolutionary studies."

Herein, the three homoeologous copies of the allohexaploid wheat EPSPS gene were cloned and characterized."
"26492960","abstracttext_methods","Genomic and coding DNA sequences of EPSPS from the three related genomes of allohexaploid wheat were isolated using PCR and inverse PCR approaches from soft white spring ""Louise'. Development of genome-specific primers allowed the mapping and expression analysis of TaEPSPS-7A1, TaEPSPS-7D1, and TaEPSPS-4A1 on chromosomes 7A, 7D, and 4A, respectively. Sequence alignments of cDNA sequences from wheat and wheat relatives served as a basis for phylogenetic analysis."
"26492960","abstracttext_results","The three genomic copies of wheat EPSPS differed by insertion/deletion and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), largely in intron sequences.

However, TaEPSPS-4A1 is expressed at much lower levels than TaEPSPS-7A1 and TaEPSPS-7D1 in wheat seedlings. Phylogenetic analysis of 1190-bp cDNA clones from wheat and wheat relatives revealed that: 1) TaEPSPS-7A1 is most similar to EPSPS from the tetraploid AB genome donor, T. turgidum (99.7 % identity); 2) TaEPSPS-7D1 most resembles EPSPS from the diploid D genome donor, Aegilops tauschii (100 % identity); and 3) TaEPSPS-4A1 resembles EPSPS from the diploid B genome relative, Ae. speltoides (97.7 % identity).

"12827355","abstracttext","Glutathione S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) gene expression was examined in the coleoptile and new leaf tissue of etiolated shoots of the diploid wheat species Triticum tauschii (Coss.) Schmal., which is considered to be a progenitor and the D-genome donor to cultivated, hexaploid bread wheat Triticum aestivum L. GST expression (mRNA, protein, and enzyme activity with a herbicide substrate) in these shoot tissues was examined in response to herbicide safener treatment. Two different antibody probes, raised against the same safener-inducible GST protein (TtGSTU1) but differing in their specificity, were utilized to determine tissue distribution and subcellular localization of GST proteins in etiolated shoots. GST transcripts, immunoreactive GST proteins, and herbicide-metabolizing activity were all highest in the coleoptile of etiolated, safener-treated T. tauschii shoots. Anti-GST immunolabeling was strongest in the outer epidermal and adjoining sub-epidermal cells in both coleoptiles and new leaves following safener treatment. Our data indicate that safeners protect grass crops from herbicide injury by dramatically inducing the expression of GST proteins in the outer cell layers of the coleoptile, which prevents the herbicide from reaching the sensitive new leaves of etiolated shoots as they emerge from the soil."

"23550706","abstracttext","Population genetic and phylogenetic studies have shown that Phaeosphaeria nodorum is a member of a species complex that probably shares its center of origin with wheat (Triticum aestivum and Triticum durum). We examined the evolutionary histories of three known necrotrophic effectors (NEs) produced by P. nodorum and compared them with neutral loci. We screened over 1000 individuals for the presence/absence of each effector and assigned each individual to a multi-effector genotype. Diversity at each NE locus was assessed by sequencing c. 200 individuals for each locus. We found significant differences in effector frequency among populations. We propose that these differences reflect the presence/absence of the corresponding susceptibility gene in wheat cultivars. The population harboring the highest sequence diversity was different for each effector locus and never coincided with populations harboring the highest diversity at neutral loci. Coalescent and phylogenetic analyses showed a discontinuous presence of all three NEs among nine closely related Phaeosphaeria species. Only two of the nine species were found to harbor NEs. We present evidence that the three described NEs of P. nodorum were transmitted to its sister species, Phaeosphaeria avenaria tritici 1, via interspecific hybridization."

"29167543","abstracttext","The ability to cause reproductive isolation often varies among individuals within a plant species. We addressed whether such polymorphism influenced speciation of the allopolyploid common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., AABBDD genome) by evaluating the expression of pre-pollination (outcrossing potential) and post-pollination (crossability) barriers in Aegilops tauschii Coss. (the D genome progenitor). In total, 201 Ae. tauschii accessions representing the entire natural habitat range of the species were used for anther length measurement and artificial crosses with a Triticum turgidum L. (the AB genome progenitor) tester. Intraspecific comparisons showed that both barriers were more strongly expressed in the TauL1 lineage than in the TauL2 lineage. The ability of Ae. tauschii to cause reproductive isolation in the hybridisation with T. turgidum might have markedly influenced common wheat's speciation by inducing lineage-associated patterns of gene flow. The TauL2 accessions with high potential for natural hybridisation with T. turgidum clustered in the southern coastal Caspian region. This provided phenotypic support for the derivation of the D genome of common wheat from southern Caspian populations. The present study underscored the importance of approaches that incorporate the genealogical and geographic structure of the parental species' reproductive isolation in understanding the mechanism of plant allopolyploid speciation."

"32740680","abstracttext_main conclusion","Four polygalacturonase gene family members were highlighted that contribute to elucidate the roles of polygalacturonase during the fertility conversion process in male-sterile wheat. Polygalacturonase (PG) belongs to a large family of hydrolases with important functions in cell separation during plant growth and development via the degradation of pectin. Specific expressed PGs in anthers may be significant for male sterility research and hybrid wheat breeding, but they have not been characterized in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, we systematically studied the PG gene family using the latest published wheat reference genomic information. In total, 113 wheat PG genes were identified, which could be classified into six categories A-F according to their structure characteristics and phylogenetic comparisons with Arabidopsis and rice. Polyploidy and segmental duplications in wheat were proved to be mainly responsible for the expansion of the wheat PG gene family. RNA-seq showed that TaPGs have specific temporal and spatial expression characteristics, in which 12 TaPGs with spike-specific expression patterns were detected by qRT-PCR in different fertility anthers of KTM3315A, a thermo-sensitive cytoplasmic male-sterile wheat. Four of them specific upregulated (TaPG09, TaPG95, and TaPG93) or downregulated (TaPG87) at trinucleate stage of fertile anthers, and further aligning with the homologous in Arabidopsis revealed that they may undertake functions such as anther dehiscence, separation of pollen, pollen development, and pollen tube elongation, thereby inducing male fertility conversion in KTM3315A. These findings facilitate function investigations of the wheat PG gene family and provide new insights into the fertility conversion mechanism in male-sterile wheat."

"2562757","abstracttext","Methods have been developed for the isolation of aleurone protoplasts from developing caryopses of Hordeum vulgare and Triticum aestivum in order to study transient expression of introduced genes. Chimaeric gene constructs were introduced into aleurone protoplasts by polyethylene glycol (PEG). Transient expression directed by the 35S promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) of the reporter gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) was detected in aleurone protoplasts from developing barley and wheat grains. Using a similar construct, CAT activity increased when the alcohol dehydrogenase intron 1 fragment from maize was ligated between the 35S promoter and the CAT coding region. The demonstration of transient expression in protoplasts from developing aleurone layers indicates that they may be useful for investigating tissue and developmental control of genes coding for cereal seed proteins."

"16653192","abstracttext","Uninucleate microspores in anther cultures of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Pavon) are capable of producing haploid pollen embryoids and plants. To gain an understanding of this alternate pathway of pollen development, we constructed a cDNA library to young pollen embryoids, isolated embryoid-specific genes, and analyzed their expression patterns during morphogenesis. Two embryoid-abundant clones, pEMB4 and 94, were expressed very early during culture, suggesting that these genes are associated with development and are not simply expressed as a consequence of differentiation. The accumulation patterns of five cloned mRNAs may indicate the activation of specific genes associated with the major morphological and physiological activities connected with the differentiation of embryoids in vitro. These results suggest that embryoid-abundant gene expression is causally related to this pathway because gene expression is spatially and temporally specific and is not observed when microspores are cultured under noninductive conditions."

Genetic analysis using an F2:3 population derived from a cross between Hongyanglazi and susceptible cultivar Zhongzuo 9504 indicated that Hongyanglazi carried a single recessive gene (tentatively designated PmHYLZ) conferring its resistance to Bgt isolate E09. PmHYLZ was flanked by EST marker BE606897 and microsatellite marker Xgwm46 on chromosome 7BS at genetic distances of 1.7 and 3.6 cM, respectively. This gene differed from Pm40, also located on 7BS, by origin, linked markers, and reactions to 13 Bgt isolates. Based on these findings, PmHYLZ was permanently designated as Pm47."

Studies in all organisms, but particularly in plants, indicate that a very large number of genes are expressed during meiosis, though relatively few of them seem to be required for the completion of meiosis. In this review, we focus on gene expression at the RNA level and analyze the meiotic transcriptome datasets and explore expression patterns of known meiotic genes to elucidate how gene expression could be regulated during meiosis. We also discuss mechanisms, such as chromatin organization and non-coding RNAs that might be involved in the regulation of meiotic transcription patterns."

Pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) between an imazamox-resistant (IR) volunteer wheat population and a non-IR spring wheat crop was assessed over a range of volunteer emergence timings and plant population densities that collectively promoted flowering asynchrony. Natural hybridization events between the two populations were detected by phenotypically scoring plants in F(1) populations followed by verification with Mendelian segregation ratios in the F(1:2) lines. Based on the examination of >545,000 seedlings, we identified a hybridization window in spring wheat approximately 125 growing degree-days (GDD) in length. We found a sizeable reduction (two- to four-fold) in gene flow frequencies when flowering occurred outside of this window. The hybridization window identified in this research also will serve to temporally isolate neighboring wheat crops. However, strict control of volunteer populations or spatial isolation of neighbouring crops emerging within a 125 GDD hybridization window will be necessary to maintain low frequencies of PMGF in spring wheat fields. The model developed herein also is likely to be applicable to other wind-pollinated species."

"23381809","abstracttext","The introgression of Reduced height (Rht)-B1b and Rht-D1b into bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties beginning in the 1960s led to improved lodging resistance and yield, providing a major contribution to the 'green revolution'. Although wheat Rht-1 and surrounding sequence is available, the genetic composition of this region has not been examined in a homoeologous series. To determine this, three Rht-1-containing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequences derived from the A, B, and D genomes of the bread wheat variety Chinese Spring (CS) were fully assembled and analyzed. This revealed that Rht-1 and two upstream genes were highly conserved among the homoeologs. In contrast, transposable elements (TEs) were not conserved among homoeologs with the exception of intronic miniature inverted-repeat TEs (MITEs). In relation to the Triticum urartu ancestral line, CS-A genic sequences were highly conserved and several colinear TEs were present. Comparative analysis of the CS wheat BAC sequences with assembled Poaceae genomes showed gene synteny and amino acid sequences were well preserved. Further 5' and 3' of the wheat BAC sequences, a high degree of gene colinearity is present among the assembled Poaceae genomes. In the 20 kb of sequence flanking Rht-1, five conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) were present among the CS wheat homoeologs and among all the Poaceae members examined. Rht-A1 was mapped to the long arm of chromosome 4 and three closely flanking genetic markers were identified. The tools developed herein will enable detailed studies of Rht-1 and linked genes that affect abiotic and biotic stress response in wheat."

"31102452","abstracttext","The agricultural landscape of North Dakota is changing. Corn and soybean are now commonplace, but once were rare. Spring sown wheat Triticum aestivum L. and durum wheat Triticum turgidum spp. durum continue to be dominant, but more winter-sown wheat is expected in the future. The presence of wheat in the landscape throughout much of the year will benefit populations of the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), which occurs throughout the state, sometimes in large numbers. Hessian fly is unusual among crop pests for which resources for plant resistance are well developed. On wheat genotypes expressing a single effective H resistance gene, 100% of larvae die before exhibiting any growth. Over 35 H genes in the public domain are available for crossing into elite cultivars. We explored the effectiveness of 31 Hessian fly resistance genes for a North Dakota Hessian fly population. Six genes-H4, H15, H21, H23, H26, and H29-caused 100% larval mortality. Seven others caused at least 80% mortality. Experimental data were used to address three additional questions. Do adult females avoid laying eggs on plants that will kill their offspring: Are neonate larvae able to detect resistance that will end up killing them? Do all 31 genes confer equal protection against larval-induced growth deficits? North Dakota wheat breeders have the necessary tools to create highly resistant wheat cultivars. So far, H genes have been deployed singly in cultivars. Advances in plant breeding will enable gene stacking, a more durable strategy over time."

"19707805","abstracttext","The wheat high molecular weight (HMW) glutenins are important seed storage proteins that determine bread-making quality in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). In this study, detailed comparative sequence analyses of large orthologous HMW glutenin genomic regions from eight grass species, representing a wide evolutionary history of grass genomes, reveal a number of lineage-specific sequence changes. These lineage-specific changes, which resulted in duplications, insertions, and deletions of genes, are the major forces disrupting gene colinearity among grass genomes. Our results indicate that the presence of the HMW glutenin gene in Triticeae genomes was caused by lineage-specific duplication of a globulin gene. This tandem duplication event is shared by Brachypodium and Triticeae genomes, but is absent in rice, maize, and sorghum, suggesting the duplication occurred after Brachypodium and Triticeae genomes diverged from the other grasses ~35 Ma ago. Aside from their physical location in tandem, the sequence similarity, expression pattern, and conserved cis-acting elements responsible for endosperm-specific expression further support the paralogous relationship between the HMW glutenin and globulin genes. While the duplicated copy in Brachypodium has apparently become nonfunctional, the duplicated copy in wheat has evolved to become the HMW glutenin gene by gaining a central prolamin repetitive domain."

"22042660","abstracttext","Utilization of a two-line breeding system via photoperiod-thermo sensitive male sterility has a great potential for hybrid production in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). 337S is a novel wheat male sterile line sensitive to both short daylength/low temperature and long daylength/high temperature. Five F(2) populations derived from the crosses between 337S and five common wheat varieties were developed for genetic analysis. All F(1)'s were highly fertile while segregation occurred in the F(2) populations with a ratio of 3 fertile:1 sterile under short daylength/low temperature. It is shown that male sterility in 337S was controlled by a single recessive gene, temporarily designated as wptms3. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) coupled with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was applied to map the sterile gene using one mapping population. The wptms3 gene was mapped to chromosome arm 1BS and flanked by Xgwm413 and Xgwm182 at a genetic distance of 3.2 and 23.5 cM, respectively. The accuracy and efficiency of marker-assisted selection were evaluated and proved essential for identifying homozygous recessive male sterile genotypes of the wptms3 gene in F(2) generation."

"22143034","abstracttext","The full-length cDNA sequence (1158 bp) encoding a ribosomal L5 protein, designated as TaL5, was firstly isolated from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends method (RACE). The open reading frame (ORF) of TaL5 gene was 906 bp, and its deduced amino acid sequence (301 residues) shared high similarity to those of other higher plant L5 proteins. TaL5 protein contained a putative 5S binding region (74 amino acids). TaL5 DNA sequence was further cloned, and sequence analysis showed that it contained 7 introns and 8 exons. Predicated using TargetP software, TaL5 protein was putatively located in mitochondria and contains a transit peptide of 12 amino acids. During grain filling period, temporal expression pattern of TaL5 gene was approximately consistent with the rates of starch accumulation in grains. Additionally, TaL5 gene was dramatically induced by salt, drought and freezing stresses, exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA) in wheat seedlings. These implied that TaL5 gene could function in growth, development and abiotic stresses in wheat plants."

"22352715","abstracttext","Programmed cell death (PCD) is a physiological process to remove redundant or harmful cells, for the development of multicellular organisms, or for restricting the spread of pathogens (hypersensitive response). Metacaspases are cysteine-dependent proteases which play an essential role in PCD. Triticum aestivum metacaspase 4 (TaMCA4) is a type II metacaspase gene cloned from 'Suwon11' wheat, with typical structural features such as peptidase C14 caspase domain and a long linker sequence between the two subunits. Transient expression of TaMCA4 in tobacco leaves failed to induce PCD directly but enhanced cell death triggered by a mouse Bax gene or a candidate effector gene from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. Enhancement of PCD was also observed in wheat leaves co-bombarded with TaMCA4. When challenged with the avirulent race of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, the expression level of TaMCA4 in wheat leaves was sharply upregulated, whereas the transcript level was not significantly induced by the virulent race. Moreover, knocking down TaMCA4 expression by virus-induced gene silencing enhanced the susceptibility of Suwon11 to the avirulent race of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici and reduced the necrotic area at infection sites."

"23400828","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is one of the most devastating foliar diseases of wheat and imposes a constant challenge on wheat breeders. Xiaohongpi, a Chinese landrace of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), shows resistance to powdery mildew during the entire growth stage in the field and under controlled conditions. The F1 plants from cross of the powdery mildew susceptible cultivar Yangmai158 with Xiaohongpi were susceptible to isolate Bgt19, the locally most prevalent Bgt isolate. In the derived F2 population and F3 progenies, the resistance segregation deviated significantly from the one-gene Mendelian ratio. However, marker analysis indicated that only one recessive gene conferred the resistance, which co-segregated with Xsts-bcd1231 that showed co-segregation with Pm4a in different studies. Allelism test indicated that this recessive resistance gene, designated as pmX, is either allelic or tightly linked to Pm4a. The pmX gene was different from Pm4 alleles in resistance spectrum. Examination of the genotype frequencies at pmX and the linked marker loci in the F2 population showed that a genetic variation favoring the transmission of Xiaohongpi alleles could be the cause of deviated segregation. Mapping of the pmX-linked markers using Chinese Spring deletion lines indicated that it resides in the 0.85-1.00 bin of chromosome 2AL."
"26244554","articletitle","Comparison of Leaf Sheath Transcriptome Profiles with Physiological Traits of Bread Wheat Cultivars under Salinity Stress."
"26244554","abstracttext","Salinity stress has significant negative effects on plant biomass production and crop yield. Salinity tolerance is controlled by complex systems of gene expression and ion transport. The relationship between specific features of mild salinity stress adaptation and gene expression was analyzed using four commercial varieties of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) that have different levels of salinity tolerance. The high-throughput phenotyping system in The Plant Accelerator at the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility revealed variation in shoot relative growth rate and salinity tolerance among the four cultivars. Comparative analysis of gene expression in the leaf sheaths identified genes whose functions are potentially linked to shoot biomass development and salinity tolerance. Early responses to mild salinity stress through changes in gene expression have an influence on the acquisition of stress tolerance and improvement in biomass accumulation during the early ""osmotic"" phase of salinity stress. In addition, results revealed transcript profiles for the wheat cultivars that were different from those of usual stress-inducible genes, but were related to those of plant growth. These findings suggest that, in the process of breeding, selection of specific traits with various salinity stress-inducible genes in commercial bread wheat has led to adaptation to mild salinity conditions."
"25250511","articletitle","A wheat 1-FEH w3 variant underlies enzyme activity for stem WSC remobilization to grain under drought."
"25250511","abstracttext","In wheat stems, the levels of fructan-dominated water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) do not always correlate well with grain yield. Field drought experiments were carried out to further explain this lack of correlation. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties, Westonia, Kauz and c. 20 genetically diverse double haploid (DH) lines derived from them were investigated. Substantial genotypic differences in fructan remobilization were found and the 1-FEH w3 gene was shown to be the major contributor in the stem fructan remobilization process based on enzyme activity and gene expression results. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected in an auxin response element in the 1-FEH w3 promoter region, therefore we speculated that the mutated Westonia allele might affect gene expression and enzyme activity levels. A cleaved amplified polymorphic (CAP) marker was generated from the SNP. The harvested results showed that the mutated Westonia 1-FEH w3 allele was associated with a higher thousand grain weight (TGW) under drought conditions in 2011 and 2012. These results indicated that higher gene expression of 1-FEH w3 and 1-FEH w3 mediated enzyme activities that favoured stem WSC remobilization to the grains. The CAP marker residing in the 1-FEH w3 promoter region may facilitate wheat breeding by selecting lines with high stem fructan remobilization capacity under terminal drought."

"29534430","abstracttext","Leaf senescence is an important agronomic trait that affects both crop yield and quality. In this study, we characterized a premature leaf senescence mutant of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) obtained by ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis, named m68 . Genetic analysis showed that the leaf senescence phenotype of m68 is controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. We compared the transcriptome of wheat leaves between the wild type (WT) and the m68 mutant at four time points. Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis revealed many genes that were closely related to senescence genes. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis suggested that transcription factors and protein transport genes might function in the beginning of leaf senescence, while genes that were associated with chlorophyll and carbon metabolism might function in the later stage. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that the genes that are involved in plant hormone signal transduction were significantly enriched. Through expression pattern clustering of DEGs, we identified 1012 genes that were induced during senescence, and we found that the WRKY family and zinc finger transcription factors might be more important than other transcription factors in the early stage of leaf senescence. These results will not only support further gene cloning and functional analysis of m68 , but also facilitate the study of leaf senescence in wheat."

"30754902","abstracttext"," A method for producing large numbers of transgenic wheat plants has been developed. With this approach, an average of 9.7% of immature embryo explants were transformed and generated multiple self-fertile, independently transformed plants. No untransformed plants, or escapes, were regenerated. This transformation procedure uses morphogenic calli derived from scutellum tissue of immature embryos of Triticum aestivum cv. Bobwhite co-bombarded with separate plasmids carrying a selectable marker gene (bar) and a gene of interest, respectively. Transformed wheat calli with a vigorous growth phenotype were obtained by extended culture on media containing 5.0 mg/l bialaphos. These calli retained morphogenic potential and were competent for plant regeneration for as long as 11 months. The bar gene and the gene of interest were co-expressed in T0 progeny plants. This wheat transformation protocol may facilitate quantitative production of multiple transgenic plants and significantly reduce the cost and labor otherwise required for screening out untransformed escapes."

The three genes show the same exon/intron number and size, with the only exception of a series of indels in intronic regions. The partial sequence of the Fd-GOGAT gene located on A genome was determined in two durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) cvs Ciccio and Svevo, characterized by different grain protein content. Genomic differences allowed the gene mapping in the centromeric region of chromosome 2A. QTL analysis was conducted in the Svevo×Ciccio RIL mapping population, previously evaluated in 5 different environments.

"14740255","abstracttext","The use of DNA sequence-based comparative genomics for evolutionary studies and for transferring information from model species to related large-genome species has revolutionized molecular genetics and breeding strategies for improving those crops. Comparative sequence analysis methods can be used to cross-reference genes between species maps, enhance the resolution of comparative maps, study patterns of gene evolution, identify conserved regions of the genomes, and facilitate interspecies gene cloning. In this study, 5,780 Triticeae ESTs that have been physically mapped using wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) deletion lines and segregating populations were compared using NCBI BLASTN to the first draft of the public rice ( Oryza sativa L.) genome sequence data from 3,280 ordered BAC/PAC clones. A rice genome view of the homoeologous wheat genome locations based on sequence analysis shows general similarity to the previously published comparative maps based on Southern analysis of RFLP. For most rice chromosomes there is a preponderance of wheat genes from one or two wheat chromosomes. The physical locations of non-conserved regions were not consistent across rice chromosomes. Some wheat ESTs with multiple wheat genome locations are associated with the non-conserved regions of similarity between rice and wheat. The inverse view, showing the relationship between the wheat deletion map and rice genomic sequence, revealed the breakdown of gene content and order at the resolution conferred by the physical chromosome deletions in the wheat genome. An average of 35% of the putative single copy genes that were mapped to the most conserved bins matched rice chromosomes other than the one that was most similar. This suggests that there has been an abundance of rearrangements, insertions, deletions, and duplications eroding the wheat-rice genome relationship that may complicate the use of rice as a model for cross-species transfer of information in non-conserved regions."

Here we report the identification and possible role of some of these ATPases from wheat."
"29078753","abstracttext_results","In this study, ACA and ECA sequences of six species (belonging to Poaceae) were retrieved from different databases and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. A high degree of evolutionary relatedness was observed among P 2 sequences characterized in this study. Members of the respective groups from different plant species were observed to fall under the same clade. This pattern highlights the common ancestry of P 2- type calcium ATPases. Furthermore, qRT-PCR was used to analyse the expression of selected ACAs and ECAs from Triticum aestivum (wheat) under calcium toxicity and calcium deficiency. The data indicated that expression of ECAs is enhanced under calcium stress, suggesting possible roles of these ATPases in calcium homeostasis in wheat. Similarly, the expression of ACAs was significantly different in plants grown under calcium stress as compared to plants grown under control conditions. This gives clues to the role of ACAs in signal transduction during calcium stress in wheat."
"29078753","abstracttext_conclusion","Here we concluded that wheat genome consists of nine P 2B and three P 2A -type calcium ATPases. Moreover, gene loss events in wheat ancestors lead to the loss of a particular homoeolog of a gene in wheat. To elaborate the role of these wheat ATPases, qRT-PCR was performed. The results indicated that when plants are exposed to calcium stress, both P 2A and P 2B gene expression get enhanced. This further gives clues about the possible role of these ATPases in wheat in calcium management. These findings can be useful in future for genetic manipulations as well as in wheat genome annotation process."

"11830676","abstracttext","Yield in cereals is a function of seed number and weight; both parameters are largely controlled by seed sink strength. The allosteric enzyme ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP) plays a key role in regulating starch biosynthesis in cereal seeds and is likely the most important determinant of seed sink strength. Plant AGPs are heterotetrameric, consisting of two large and two small subunits. We transformed wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with a modified form of the maize (Zea mays L.) Shrunken2 gene (Sh2r6hs), which encodes an altered AGP large subunit. The altered large subunit gives rise to a maize AGP heterotetramer with decreased sensitivity to its negative allosteric effector, orthophosphate, and more stable interactions between large and small subunits. The Sh2r6hs transgene was still functional after five generations in wheat. Developing seeds from Sh2r6hs transgenic wheat exhibited increased AGP activity in the presence of a range of orthophosphate concentrations in vitro. Transgenic Sh2r6hs wheat lines produced on average 38% more seed weight per plant. Total plant biomass was increased by 31% in Sh2r6hs plants. Results indicate increased availability and utilization of resources in response to enhanced seed sink strength, increasing seed yield, and total plant biomass."

EST loci were unevenly distributed among chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D with 660, 826, and 726, respectively. The number of EST loci was greater on the long arms than on the short arms for all three chromosomes. The distribution of ESTs along chromosome arms was nonrandom with EST clusters occurring in the distal regions of short arms and middle regions of long arms. Duplications of group 1 ESTs in other homoeologous groups occurred at a rate of 35.5%. Seventy-five percent of wheat chromosome 1 ESTs had significant matches with rice sequences (E < or = e(-10)), where large regions of conservation occurred between wheat consensus chromosome 1 and rice chromosome 5 and between the proximal portion of the long arm of wheat consensus chromosome 1 and rice chromosome 10. Only 9.5% of group 1 ESTs showed significant matches to Arabidopsis genome sequences. The results presented are useful for gene mapping and evolutionary and comparative genomics of grasses."

Tandem mass spectrometry data of individual peptides was then searched by SEQUEST, using a database containing known protein sequences from both wheat and other homologous cereal crops. Using this approach we identified 108 proteins from whole amyloplasts and 63 proteins from purified amyloplast membranes. The majority of protein identifications were derived from protein sequences from cereal crops other than wheat, for which relatively little gene sequence data is available. The highest percentage of protein identifications obtained from any individual species was 46% of the total number of proteins identified, using sequence data found in our proprietary rice (Oryza sativa) genome database."

However, it was abandoned for cultivation before the Bronze Age and has infrequently been used in wheat breeding. Little is known about the genetic variation in adaptively important biological traits in T. monococcum. A collection of 30 accessions of diverse geographic origins were characterized for phenotypic variation in various agro-morphological traits including grain storage proteins and endosperm texture, nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain profiles of resistance (R) genes and resistance gene analogues (RGAs), and germination under salt and drought stresses. Forty-six SSR (single sequence repeat) markers from bread wheat (T. aestivum, 2n=6x=42, AABBDD) A genome were used to establish trait-marker associations using linear mixed models. Multiple significant associations were identified, some of which were on chromosomal regions containing previously known genetic loci. It is concluded that T. monococcum possesses large genetic diversity in multiple traits. The findings also indicate that the efficiency of association mapping is much higher in T. monococcum than in other plant species. The use of T. monococcum as a reference species for wheat functional genomics is discussed."

"18178768","abstracttext","The grass family comprises the most important cereal crops and is a good system for studying, with comparative genomics, mechanisms of evolution, speciation, and domestication. Here, we identified and characterized the evolution of shared duplications in the rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) genomes by comparing 42,654 rice gene sequences with 6426 mapped wheat ESTs using improved sequence alignment criteria and statistical analysis. Intraspecific comparisons identified 29 interchromosomal duplications covering 72% of the rice genome and 10 duplication blocks covering 67.5% of the wheat genome. Using the same methodology, we assessed orthologous relationships between the two genomes and detected 13 blocks of colinearity that represent 83.1 and 90.4% of the rice and wheat genomes, respectively. Integration of the intraspecific duplications data with colinearity relationships revealed seven duplicated segments conserved at orthologous positions. A detailed analysis of the length, composition, and divergence time of these duplications and comparisons with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and maize (Zea mays) indicated common and lineage-specific patterns of conservation between the different genomes.

"18488187","abstracttext","The transcription factor GAMYB is involved in gibberellin signalling in cereal aleurone cells and in plant developmental processes. Nucleotide diversity of HvGAMYB and TaGAMYB was investigated in 155 barley (Hordeum vulgare) and 42 wheat (Triticum aestivum) accessions, respectively. Polymorphisms defined 18 haplotypes in the barley collection and 1, 7 and 3 haplotypes for the A, B, and D genomes of wheat, respectively. We found that (1) Hv- and TaGAMYB genes have identical structures. (2) Both genes show a high level of nucleotide identity (>95%) in the coding sequences and the distribution of polymorphisms is similar in both collections. At the protein level the functional domain is identical in both species. (3) GAMYB genes map to a syntenic position on chromosome 3. GAMYB genes are different in both collections with respect to the Tajima D statistic and linkage disequilibrium (LD). A moderate level of LD was observed in the barley collection. In wheat, LD is absolute between polymorphic sites, mostly located in the first intron, while it decays within the gene. Differences in Tajima D values might be due to a lower selection pressure on HvGAMYB, compared to its wheat orthologue. Altogether our results provide evidence that there have been only few evolutionary changes in Hv- and TaGAMYB. This confirms the close relationship between these species and also highlights the functional importance of this transcription factor."

"16277434","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum, is a major concern worldwide. FHB grain is reduced in yield, may fail to germinate, and is often contaminated with deoxynivalenol, a trichothecene mycotoxin linked to a variety of animal diseases and feed refusals. Annual losses in the tens of millions of dollars due to FHB underscore the need to develop improved methods of disease control and prevention. Previous research has identified deoxynivalenol biosynthesis as a virulence factor on wheat. Recently, we found that the TRI14 gene of F. sporotrichioides, closely related to F. graminearum, was not required for synthesis of a related trichothecene, T-2 toxin. TRI14 does not share similarity with any previously described genes in the databases. In this study, we examined the role that F. graminearum TRI14 may play in both deoxynivalenol synthesis and in virulence on wheat. TRI14 deletion mutants synthesize deoxynivalenol on cracked maize kernel medium and exhibit wild-type colony morphology and growth rate on complex and minimal agar media. However, FHB assays on greenhouse-grown wheat indicate that FgDeltaTri14 mutants cause 50-80% less disease than wild type and do not produce a detectable quantity of deoxynivalenol on plants. We discuss a number of possible roles that TRI14 may play in the disease process."

"17033819","abstracttext","RNA editing is a process that modifies the information content of mitochondrial messenger RNAs in flowering plants changing specific cytosine residues into uridine. To gain insight into editing site recognition, we used electroporation to introduce engineered wheat (Triticum aestivum) or potato (Solanum tuberosum) mitochondrial cox2 genes, and an atp9-containing chimeric gene, into non-cognate mitochondria, and observed the efficiency of editing in these contexts. Both wheat and potato mitochondria were able to express ""foreign"" constructs, and their products were properly spliced. Seventeen and twelve editing sites are present in the coding regions of wheat and potato cox2 transcripts, respectively. Eight are common to both plants, whereas nine are specific to wheat, and four to potato. An analogous situation is found for the atp9 mRNA coding regions from these species. We found that both mitochondria were able to recognize sites that are already present as T at the genomic level, making RNA editing unnecessary for that specific residue in the cognate organelle. Our results demonstrate that non-cognate mitochondria are able to edit residues that are not edited in their own transcripts, and support the hypothesis that the same trans-acting factor may recognize several editing sites."

"19656043","abstracttext","The response of resistant wheat-Aegilops ventricosa introgression line H-93-8 and its susceptible parent, Triticum aestivum H-10-15, to Ha71 Spanish population of Heterodera avenae was studied to determine the changes in peroxidase gene expression during incompatible and compatible wheat-nematode interactions. Twenty peroxidase genes were characterized from both 211 expressed sequence tags and 259 genomic DNA clones. Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences and phylogenetic clustering with peroxidases from other plant species showed that these enzymes fall into seven different groups (designated TaPrx108 to TaPrx114) which represent peroxidases secreted to the apoplast by a putative N-terminal peptide signal. TaPrx111, TaPrx112, and TaPrx113 were induced by nematode infection in both genotypes but with differing magnitude and timing. TaPrx112 and TaPrx113 groups increased more in resistant than in susceptible infected lines. In addition, in situ hybridization analyses of genes belonging to TaPrx111, TaPrx112, and TaPrx113 groups revealed a more intense signal in cells close to the vascular cylinder and parenchyma vascular cells of resistant than susceptible wheat when challenged by nematodes. These data seem to suggest that wheat apoplastic peroxidases, because of their different expression in quantity and timing, play different roles in the plant response to nematode infection."

"21896881","abstracttext","Seed dormancy is an adaptive mechanism and an important agronomic trait. Temperature during seed development strongly affects seed dormancy in wheat (Triticum aestivum) with lower temperatures producing higher levels of seed dormancy. To identify genes important for seed dormancy, we used a wheat microarray to analyze gene expression in embryos from mature seeds grown at lower and higher temperatures. We found that a wheat homolog of MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 (MFT) was upregulated after physiological maturity in dormant seeds grown at the lower temperature. In situ hybridization analysis indicated that MFT was exclusively expressed in the scutellum and coleorhiza. Mapping analysis showed that MFT on chromosome 3A (MFT-3A) colocalized with the seed dormancy quantitative trait locus (QTL) QPhs.ocs-3A.1. MFT-3A expression levels in a dormant cultivar used for the detection of the QTL were higher after physiological maturity; this increased expression correlated with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the promoter region. In a complementation analysis, high levels of MFT expression were correlated with a low germination index in T1 seeds. Furthermore, precocious germination of isolated immature embryos was suppressed by transient introduction of MFT driven by the maize (Zea mays) ubiquitin promoter. Taken together, these results suggest that MFT plays an important role in the regulation of germination in wheat."
"23352409","articletitle","Tricin biosynthesis during growth of wheat under different abiotic stresses."
"23352409","abstracttext","In plants, O-methylation is mediated by an enzyme family of O-methyltransferases (OMTs) that transfer the methyl groups from the methyl donor, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to suitable phenolic acceptor molecules. In a previous study [1], a flavonoid OMT (TaOMT2) was isolated and characterized from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves. Its novel gene product catalyzes three sequential O-methylations of the flavone tricetin (5,7,3',4',5'-pentahydroxyflavone) to its 3'-monomethyl-(selgin)→3',5'-dimethyl-(tricin)→3',4',5'-trimethyl (TMT) ether derivatives, with tricin being the major product of the reaction. In this report, the biological significance of tricetin methylation was investigated by measuring the OMT activity, its expression level, and the accumulation of its major product (tricin) at different stages of development of wheat plants exposed to different abiotic stresses such as cold, salt and drought. The results showed that tricin accumulates mostly in wheat inflorescences under normal conditions compared to leaves and other developmental stages. Tricin accumulation was associated with increased TaOMT2 expression level and its enzyme activity, suggesting a possible de novo synthesis of the enzyme at this important developmental stage. This phenomenon may be attributed to the putative role of tricin in protecting seeds against biotic and abiotic stresses. The functions of tricin during growth and development of wheat and the importance of tricetin methylation during abiotic stresses are discussed."

"22815184","abstracttext","Regeneration of cultured tissue is a prerequisite of Agrobacterium- and biolistic-mediated plant transformation. In this study, an efficient protocol for improving wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) immature embryo regeneration was developed. Based on the statistical analysis of embryogenic callus induction efficiency, green spot differentiation efficiency, and plant regeneration efficiency from five wheat accessions, improved culture conditions were found to be more effective for embryogenic callus production than the traditional conditions. Using semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, a candidate gene, designated as TaCAT1, which encodes a catalase was identified to have a significant correlation with high-regeneration trait of wheat immature embryos. Three amino acid substitutions were found in TaCAT1 protein between high- and low-regeneration wheat accessions. Hydrogen peroxide content in the cultured calli increased from day 5 to 15, and then decreased sharply on day 20, followed by a second peak on day 25 during regeneration stage. Furthermore, a 3,500-bp 5' flanking region upstream of the first codon ATG of TaCAT1 was isolated using inverse polymerase chain reaction. In silico, analysis revealed that the TaCAT1 promoter contained two regulatory motifs associated with responses to auxin."

"22538646","abstracttext","Thirty-two isolates were obtained from wheat rhizosphere by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC). Most isolates were able to produce indole acetic acid (65.6%) and siderophores (59.3%), as well as exhibited phosphate solubilization (96.8%). Fourteen isolates displayed three plant growth-promoting traits. Among these strains, two phosphate-dissolving ones, WS29 and WS31, were evaluated for their beneficial effects on the early growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum Wan33). Strain WS29 and WS31 significantly promoted the development of lateral roots by 34.9% and 27.6%, as well as increased the root dry weight by 25.0% and 25.6%, respectively, compared to those of the control. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons and phylogenetic positions, both isolates were determined to belong to the genus Bacillus. The proportion of isolates showing the properties of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) was higher than in previous reports. The efficiency of the isolation of PGPR strains was also greatly increased by WGA labeled with FITC. The present study indicated that WGA could be used as an effective tool for isolating PGPR strains with high affinity to host plants from wheat roots. The proposed approach could facilitate research on biofertilizers or biocontrol agents."
"20804458","articletitle","The multiple origins of aluminium resistance in hexaploid wheat include Aegilops tauschii and more recent cis mutations to TaALMT1."
"20804458","abstracttext","Acid soils limit plant production worldwide because their high concentrations of soluble aluminium cations (Al(3+) ) inhibit root growth. Major food crops such as wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have evolved mechanisms to resist Al(3+) toxicity, thus enabling wider distribution. The origins of Al(3+) resistance in wheat are perplexing because all progenitors of this hexaploid species are reportedly sensitive to Al(3+) stress. The large genotypic variation for Al(3+) resistance in wheat is largely controlled by expression of an anion channel, TaALMT1, which releases malate anions from the root apices. A current hypothesis proposes that the malate anions protect this sensitive growth zone by binding to Al(3+) in the apoplasm. We investigated the evolution of this trait in wheat, and demonstrated that it has multiple independent origins that enhance Al(3+) resistance by increasing TaALMT1 expression. One origin is likely to be Aegilops tauschii while other origins occurred more recently from a series of cis mutations that have generated tandemly repeated elements in the TaALMT1 promoter. We generated transgenic plants to directly compare these promoter alleles and demonstrate that the tandemly repeated elements act to enhance gene expression. This study provides an example from higher eukaryotes in which perfect tandem repeats are linked with transcriptional regulation and phenotypic change in the context of evolutionary adaptation to a major abiotic stress."

However, the timing and synchrony of male and female flowering in wheat is a crucial determinant of seed set and may be an important factor affecting gene flow and resilience to climate change. Here, a methodology is presented for assessing the timing and synchrony of flowering in wheat, Triticum aestivum."

"22186277","abstracttext_key results and conclusions","The synchrony between pollen dehiscence and stigma collapse within a flower was dependent on its relative position in a spike and within a floret. Determined on the basis of synchrony within each flower, the level of pollination by pollen originating from other flowers reached approx. 30 % and did not change throughout the duration of flowering. A modelling exercise parameterized by flowering observations indicated that the temporal and spatial variability of anther activity within and between spikes may influence the relative resilience of wheat to sudden, extreme climatic events which has direct relevance to predicted future climate scenarios in the UK."

"23136471","abstracttext","Few genes are available to develop drought-tolerant bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars. One way to enhance bread wheat's genetic diversity would be to take advantage of the diversity of wild species by creating synthetic hexaploid wheat (SW) with the genomic constitution of bread wheat. In this study, we compared the expression of traits encoded at different ploidy levels and evaluated the applicability of Aegilops tauschii drought-related traits using 33 Ae. tauschii accessions along with their corresponding SW lines under well-watered and drought conditions. We found wide variation in Ae. tauschii, and even wider variation in the SW lines. Some SW lines were more drought-tolerant than the standard cultivar Cham 6. Aegilops tauschii from some regions gave better performing SW lines. The traits of Ae. tauschii were not significantly correlated with their corresponding SW lines, indicating that the traits expressed in wild diploid relatives of wheat may not predict the traits that will be expressed in SW lines derived from them. We suggest that, regardless of the adaptability and performance of the Ae. tauschii under drought, production of SW could probably result in genotypes with enhanced trait expression due to gene interactions, and that the traits of the synthetic should be evaluated in hexaploid level."

"24162306","abstracttext","Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), vectored by the wheat curl mite (Acer tulipae), is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the North American Great Plains. Resistant varieties have not been developed for two primary reasons. First, useful sources of resistance have not been available, and second, field screening for virus resistance is laborious and beyond the scope of most breeding programs. The first problem may have been overcome by the development of resistance to both the mite and the virus by the introgression of resistance genes from wild relatives of wheat. To help address the second problem, we have developed polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers linked to the WSMV resistance gene Wsm1. Wsm1 is contained on a translocated segment from Agropyron intermedium. One sequence-tagged-site (STS) primer set (WG232) and one RAPD marker were found to be linked to the translocation containing Wsm1. The diagnostic RAPD band was cloned and sequenced to allow the design of specific PCR primers. The PCR primers should be useful for transferring Wsm1 into locally adapted cultivars."

"24443520","abstracttext","Plant growth inhibition is a common response to salinity. Under saline conditions, Shanrong No. 3 (SR3), a bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) introgression line, performs better than its parent wheat variety Jinan 177 (JN177) with respect to both seedling growth and abiotic stress tolerance. Furthermore, the endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) was also elevated in SR3 relative to JN177. The SR3 allele of sro1, a gene encoding a poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) domain protein, was identified to be crucial for both aspects of its superior performance. Unlike RADICAL-INDUCED CELL DEATH1 and other Arabidopsis thaliana SIMILAR TO RCD-ONE (SRO) proteins, sro1 has PARP activity. Both the overexpression of Ta-sro1 in wheat and its heterologous expression in Arabidopsis promote the accumulation of ROS, mainly by enhancing the activity of NADPH oxidase and the expression of NAD(P)H dehydrogenase, in conjunction with the suppression of alternative oxidase expression. Moreover, it promotes the activity of ascorbate-GSH cycle enzymes and GSH peroxidase cycle enzymes, which regulate ROS content and cellular redox homeostasis. sro1 is also found to be involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity. We show here that the wheat SRO has PARP activity; such activity could be manipulated to improve the growth of seedlings exposed to salinity stress by modulating redox homeostasis and maintaining genomic stability."

"24425530","abstracttext","Intra- and inter-specific variation in CO2 assimilation rate (A) in Triticum spp. is well documented for reproductive growth stages. Research was conducted to characterize early vegetative photosynthetic variation in a diverse set of cultivated hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum L.) germplasm and in wild tetraploid (T. dicoccoides Korn) and hexaploid x tetraploid populations. Choice of hexaploid genotypes was based on maximum genetic distance between cultivars within the HRW and SRW wheat classes of the USA. The tetraploid material was produced by hybridizing two accessions of T. dicoccoides previously shown to differ widely in A and A/Chl but with similar leaf morphology. Genetic variability in the HRW and SRW gene pools was attributed to more recently developed descendent lines and unrelated lines rather than parental lines. Phenotypic distributions for A, stomatal conductance (gs), and internal CO2 concentration (Ci) in the F2 tetraploid population were continuous and showed transgressive segregation, reflecting quantitative inheritance with intermediate heritability. Variability in A was not associated with chlorophyll content or CO2 supply to the mesophyll measured as Ci. Genetic variability in A was also observed in the interspecific backcross population, 2*TAM W-101/PI 428109, thereby providing a germplasm pool to select for high A while restoring the D genome of hexaploid wheat. These results suggest that genetic improvement of vegetative assimilation rate is feasible in hexaploid wheat via homologous transfer from an alien source."

"25106859","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the major grain crops, and heat stress adversely affects wheat production in many regions of the world. Previously, we found a heat-responsive gene named Lipid Transfer Protein 3 (TaLTP3) in wheat. TaLTP3 was deduced to be regulated by cold, ABA, MeJA, Auxin and oxidative stress according to cis-acting motifs in its promoter sequences. In this study, we show that TaLTP3 is responsive to prolonged water deficit, salt or ABA treatment in wheat seedlings. Also, TaLTP3 accumulation was observed after the plant suffered from heat stress both at the seedling and the grain-filling stages. TaLTP3 protein was localized in the cell membrane and cytoplasm of tobacco epidermal cells. Overexpression of TaLTP3 in yeast imparted tolerance to heat stress compared to cells expressing the vector alone. Most importantly, transgenic Arabidopsis plants engineered to overexpress TaLTP3 showed higher thermotolerance than control plants at the seedling stage. Further investigation indicated that transgenic lines decreased H₂O₂ accumulation and membrane injury under heat stress. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TaLTP3 confers heat stress tolerance possibly through reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging."

Drought is a common environmental stress influencing crop growth and development. To date, it has been reported that a number of plant miRNA are involved in drought stress response. In this study, we comparatively investigated drought stress-responsive miRNAs in the root and leaf of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Sivas 111/33) by miRNA microarray screening. miRNA microarray analysis showed that 285 miRNAs (207 upregulated and 78 downregulated) and 244 miRNAs (115 upregulated and 129 downregulated) were differentially expressed in leaf and root tissues, respectively. Among the differentially expressed miRNAs, 23 miRNAs were only expressed in the leaf and 26 miRNAs were only expressed in the root of wheat growth under drought stress. Upon drought treatment, expression of miR159, miR160, miR166, miR169, miR172, miR395, miR396, miR408, miR472, miR477, miR482, miR1858, miR2118, and miR5049 were found to be significantly differentiated in bread wheat. The regulatory network analysis showed that miR395 has connections with a number of target transcripts, and miR159 and miR319 share a number of target genes. Drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive wheat cultivars showed altered expression pattern upon drought stress in terms of investigated miRNA and their target transcript expression level."

"26118129","abstracttext","Chitinases are the hydrolytic enzymes which protect plants against pathogen attack. However, the precise role of chitinases in disease resistance has not been explored in wheat. In the present study, in silico approach, including secondary structure analysis, detailed signature pattern study, cis-acting regulatory elements survey, evolutionary trends and three-dimensional molecular modeling was used for different chitinase classes of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Homology modeling of class I, II, IV and 3 chitinase proteins was performed using the template crystal structure. The model structures were further refined by molecular mechanics methods using different tools, such as Procheck, ProSA and Verify3D. Secondary structure studies revealed greater percentage of residues forming a helix conformation with specific signature pattern, similar to casein kinase II phosphorylation site, amidation site, N-myristoylation (N-MYR) site and protein kinase C phoshorylation site. The expression profile suggested that wheat chitinase gene was highly expressed in cell culture and callus. We found that wheat chitinases showed more functional similarity with rice and barley. The results provide insight into the evolution of the chitinase family, constituting a diverse array of pathogenesis-related proteins. The study also provides insight into the possible binding sites of chitinase proteins and may further enhance our knowledge of fungal resistance mechanism in plants."

"25991734","abstracttext","Stripe rust is a devastating fungal disease of wheat caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp tritici (Pst). The WHEAT KINASE START1 (WKS1) resistance gene has an unusual combination of serine/threonine kinase and START lipid binding domains and confers partial resistance to Pst. Here, we show that wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants transformed with the complete WKS1 (variant WKS1.1) are resistant to Pst, whereas those transformed with an alternative splice variant with a truncated START domain (WKS1.2) are susceptible. WKS1.1 and WKS1.2 preferentially bind to the same lipids (phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol phosphates) but differ in their protein-protein interactions. WKS1.1 is targeted to the chloroplast where it phosphorylates the thylakoid-associated ascorbate peroxidase (tAPX) and reduces its ability to detoxify peroxides. Increased expression of WKS1.1 in transgenic wheat accelerates leaf senescence in the absence of Pst. Based on these results, we propose that the phosphorylation of tAPX by WKS1.1 reduces the ability of the cells to detoxify reactive oxygen species and contributes to cell death. This response takes several days longer than typical hypersensitive cell death responses, thus allowing the limited pathogen growth and restricted sporulation that is characteristic of the WKS1 partial resistance response to Pst."

"28710348","abstracttext","Amino acid transporters have roles in amino acid uptake from soil, long-distance transport, remobilization from vegetative tissues and accumulation in grain. Critically, the majority of wheat grain nitrogen is derived from amino acids remobilized from vegetative organs. However, no systematic analysis of wheat AAT genes has been reported to date. Here, 283 full length wheat AAT genes representing 100 distinct groups of homeologs were identified and curated by selectively consolidating IWGSC CSSv2 and TGACv1 Triticum aestivum genome assemblies and reassembling or mapping of IWGSC CSS chromosome sorted reads to fill any gaps. Gene expression profiling was performed using public RNA-seq data from root, leaf, stem, spike, grain and grain cells (transfer cell (TC), aleurone cell (AL), and starchy endosperm (SE)). AATs highly expressed in roots are good candidates for amino acid uptake from soil whilst AATs highly expressed in senescing leaves and stems may be involved in translocation to grain. AATs in TC (TaAAP2 and TaAAP19) and SE (TaAAP13) may play important roles in determining grain protein content and grain yield. The expression levels of AAT homeologs showed unequal contributions in response to abiotic stresses and development, which may aid wheat adaptation to a wide range of environments."

"27759089","abstracttext","Mycosphaerella graminicola (Zymoseptoria tritici commonly known as Septoria), the causal agent of Septoria Leaf Blotch (STB), is considered one of the major threats to European wheat production. Previous studies have shown the importance of ubiquitination in plant defence against a multitude of pathogens. However the ubiquitination machinery in wheat is under studied, particularly E2 enzymes that have the ability to control the ubiquitination and thereby the fate of many different target proteins. In this study we identify an E2 enzyme, Triticum aestivum Ubiquitin conjugating enzyme 4 (TaU4) that functions in wheat defence against Septoria. We demonstrate TaU4 to be a bona fide E2 enzyme through an E2 charging assay. TaU4 localises in both the cytoplasm and nucleus, therefore potentially interacting with E3 ligases and substrate proteins in multiple compartments. Virus Induced Gene Silencing of TaU4 in wheat leaves resulted in delayed development of disease symptoms, reduced Septoria growth and reproduction. We conclude that TaU4 is a novel negative regulator of defence against Septoria."

In the present study, TaAGPS1b was fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in rice protoplast cells, and confocal fluorescence microscopy observations revealed that like other AGPS1b containing the normal transit peptide, TaAGPS1b-GFP was localized in chloroplasts. TaAGPS1b was further overexpressed in a Chinese bread wheat cultivar, and the transgenic wheat lines exhibited a significant increase in endosperm AGPase activities, starch contents, and grain weights. These suggested that TaAGPS1b subunit was targeted into plastids by its truncated transit peptide and it could play an important role in starch synthesis in bread wheat grains."

"29664146","abstracttext","Responses of wheat (Triticum aestivum) to complete submergence are not well understood as research has focused on waterlogging (soil flooding). The aim of this study was to characterize the responses of 2 wheat cultivars differing vastly in submergence tolerance to test if submergence tolerance was linked to shoot carbohydrate consumption as seen in rice. Eighteen-day-old wheat cultivars Frument (intolerant) and Jackson (tolerant) grown in soil were completely submerged for up to 19 days while assessing responses in physiology, gene expression, and shoot metabolome. Results revealed 50% mortality after 9.3 and 15.9 days of submergence in intolerant Frument and tolerant Jackson, respectively, and significantly higher growth in Jackson during recovery. Frument displayed faster leaf degradation as evident from leaf tissue porosity, chlorophyll a , and metabolomic fingerprinting. Surprisingly, shoot soluble carbohydrates, starch, and individual sugars declined to similarly low levels in both cultivars by day 5, showing that cultivar Jackson tolerated longer periods of low shoot carbohydrate levels than Frument. Moreover, intolerant Frument showed higher levels of phytol and the lipid peroxidation marker malondialdehyde relative to tolerant Jackson. Consequently, we propose to further investigate the role of ethylene sensitivity and deprivation of reactive O 2 species in submerged wheat."

A set of 4R Ku dissection lines was obtained and 301 new 4R Ku -specific markers were developed using specific length amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) technology. These markers were combined with the 99 4R Ku -specific markers previously developed, and were physically mapped to 4R Ku chromosome using the new FISH map and the 4R Ku dissection lines. A total of 338 of the 400 markers have been successfully mapped to six regions of 4R Ku chromosome. Additionally, the powdery mildew resistance gene(s) on the 4RL Ku arm was located to the segment between L.4 and L.8, the same region where 115 4RL Ku -specific markers were mapped. The markers developed in this study can be used to identify a specific segment of 4R chromatin in wheat backgrounds, help construct a high-density physical map of 4R chromosome, and facilitate the utilization of elite genes on 4R chromosome in wheat breeding programs."

"29247572","abstracttext","Abiotic stressors are main limiting factors for agricultural production around the world. Plant growth-promoting bacteria have been successfully used to improve abiotic stress tolerance in several crops including wheat. However, the molecular changes involved in the improvement of stress management are poorly understood. The present investigation addressed some molecular factors involved in bacterially induced plant abiotic stress responses by identifying differentially expressed genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum) seedlings treated with the beneficial bacterium Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum UCMB5113 prior to challenge with abiotic stress conditions such as heat, cold or drought. cDNA-AFLP analysis revealed differential expression of more than 200 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) in wheat leaves. Expression of selected TDFs was confirmed using RT-PCR. DNA sequencing of 31 differentially expressed TDFs revealed significant homology with both known and unknown genes in database searches. Virus-induced gene silencing of two abscisic acid-related TDFs showed different effects upon heat and drought stress. We conclude that treatment with B. amyloliquefaciens 5113 caused molecular modifications in wheat in order to induce tolerance against heat, cold and drought stress. Bacillus treatment provides systemic effects that involve metabolic and regulatory functions supporting both growth and stress management."

"29596529","abstracttext","Plant expansins are proteins involved in cell wall loosening, plant growth, and development, as well as in response to plant diseases and other stresses. In this study, we identified 128 expansin coding sequences from the wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome. These sequences belong to 45 homoeologous copies of TaEXPs, including 26 TaEXPAs, 15 TaEXPBs and four TaEXLAs. No TaEXLB was identified. Gene expression and sub-expression profiles revealed that most of the TaEXPs were expressed either only in root tissues or in multiple organs. Real-time qPCR analysis showed that many TaEXPs were differentially expressed in four different tissues of the two wheat cultivars-the cold-sensitive 'Chinese Spring (CS)' and the cold-tolerant 'Dongnongdongmai 1 (D1)' cultivars. Our results suggest that the differential expression of TaEXPs could be related to low-temperature tolerance or sensitivity of different wheat cultivars. Our study expands our knowledge on wheat expansins and sheds new light on the functions of expansins in plant development and stress response."

"32168957","abstracttext","Micronutrient deficiencies, and especially zinc (Zn) deficiency, pose serious health problems to people who mainly depend on cereal-based diets. Here, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to detect the genetic basis of the Zn accumulation in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) grains with a diversity panel of 207 bread wheat varieties. To uncover authentic quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling Zn accumulation, the varieties were planted in three locations. In total, 29 unique loci associated with Zn grain accumulation were identified. Notably, seven non-redundant loci located on chromosomes 1B, 3B, 3D, 4A, 5A, 5B, and 7A, were detected at least in two environments. Of these quantitative trait loci (QTL), six coincided with known QTL or genes, whereas the highest effect QTL on chromosome 3D identified in this study was not reported previously. Searches of public databases revealed that the seven identified QTL coincided with seven putative candidate genes linked to Zn accumulation. Among these seven genes, NAC domain-containing protein gene ( TraesCS3D02G078500 ) linked with the most significant single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) AX-94729264 on chromosome 3D was relevant to metal accumulation in wheat grains. Results of this study provide new insights into the genetic architecture of Zn accumulation in wheat grains."

"32457768","abstracttext","There is a growing interest in breeding and production of hexaploid triticale (× Triticosecale Wittmack ex A. Camus) in European Union and in the world. It is reported that triticale can be an alternative to wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) for livestock feed production and has a potential to become preferred industrial energy crop. Fungal diseases, mainly leaf and stripe rusts, are the limiting factors of triticale growth and yield. Geneticists and breeders are now focusing on accumulation of the major genes for durability of rust resistance. Slow-rusting genes Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr19 are being exploited in many wheat breeding programs. This type of horizontal resistance is reported to be effective over space and time. Classical breeding techniques supported by marker-assisted selection (MAS) are the main tools in breeding programs. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of transfer of slow-rusting genes from resistant genotypes of wheat into hexaploid triticale through cross-hybridizations. A total of 5,094 manual pollinations were conducted between two triticale cultivars Fredro and Twingo and 33 accessions of common wheat, which were reported as sources of slow-rusting resistance genes. The investigation of the slow-rusting gene transmission was performed using both molecular markers analyses and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). In total, 34 F 1 hybrid plants were obtained, and 29 of them carried both slow-rusting loci. Therefore, these hybrids may be used for triticale prebreeding program."

"30840709","abstracttext","The NAC family is one of the largest plant-specific transcription factor families, and some of its members are known to play major roles in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Here, we inventoried 488 NAC members in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Using the recent release of the wheat genome (IWGS RefSeq v1.0), we studied duplication events focusing on genomic regions from 4B-4D-5A chromosomes as an example of the family expansion and neofunctionalization of TaNAC members. Differentially expressed TaNAC genes in organs and in response to abiotic stresses were identified using publicly available RNAseq data. Expression profiling of 23 selected candidate TaNAC genes was studied in leaf and grain from two bread wheat genotypes at two developmental stages in field drought conditions and revealed insights into their specific and/or overlapping expression patterns. This study showed that, of the 23 TaNAC genes, seven have a leaf-specific expression and five have a grain-specific expression. In addition, the grain-specific genes profiles in response to drought depend on the genotype. These genes may be considered as potential candidates for further functional validation and could present an interest for crop improvement programs in response to climate change. Globally, the present study provides new insights into evolution, divergence and functional analysis of NAC gene family in bread wheat."

"30555105","abstracttext","In this study, we investigated the genetic diversity and population structure of the core collection of hexaploid wheat accessions in the Japanese wheat gene bank NBRP-Wheat. The core collection, consisting of 188 accessions of Triticum aestivum, T. spelta, T. compactum, T. sphaerococcum, T. macha and T. vavilovii, was intensively genotyped by DArTseq markers and consisted of 20,186 SNPs and 60,077 present and absent variations (PAVs). Polymorphic markers were distributed in all chromosomes, with a tendency for smaller numbers on the D-genome chromosomes. We examined the population structure by Bayesian clustering and principal component analysis with a general linear model. Overall, the core collection was divided into seven clusters. Non-admixture accessions in each cluster indicated that the clusters reflect the geographic distribution of the accessions. Both structure analyses strongly suggested that the cluster consisting of T. spelta and T. macha is out-grouped from other hexaploid wheat accessions. We performed genome-wide association analysis pilot studies for nine quantitative and seven qualitative traits and found marker-trait associations for all traits but one, indicating that the current core collection will be useful for detecting uncharacterized QTLs associated with phenotypes of interest."

"30623558","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is cultivated on more land than any other crop and produces a fifth of the calories consumed by humans. Wheat endosperm is rich in starch yet contains low concentrations of dietary iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn). Biofortification is a micronutrient intervention aimed at increasing the density and bioavailability of essential vitamins and minerals in staple crops; Fe biofortification of wheat has proved challenging. In this study we employed constitutive expression (CE) of the rice (Oryza sativa L.) nicotianamine synthase 2 (OsNAS2) gene in bread wheat to up-regulate biosynthesis of two low molecular weight metal chelators - nicotianamine (NA) and 2'-deoxymugineic acid (DMA) - that play key roles in metal transport and nutrition. The CE-OsNAS2 plants accumulated higher concentrations of grain Fe, Zn, NA and DMA and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) revealed enhanced localization of Fe and Zn in endosperm and crease tissues, respectively. Iron bioavailability was increased in white flour milled from field-grown CE-OsNAS2 grain and positively correlated with NA and DMA concentrations."

"31739570","abstracttext","The WRKY transcription factor superfamily is known to participate in plant growth and stress response. However, the role of this family in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is largely unknown. Here, a salt-induced gene TaWRKY13 was identified in an RNA-Seq data set from salt-treated wheat. The results of RT-qPCR analysis showed that TaWRKY13 was significantly induced in NaCl-treated wheat and reached an expression level of about 22-fold of the untreated wheat. Then, a further functional identification was performed in both Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa L. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that TaWRKY13 is a nuclear-localized protein. Moreover, various stress-related regulatory elements were predicted in the promoter. Expression pattern analysis revealed that TaWRKY13 can also be induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG), exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and cold stress. After NaCl treatment, overexpressed Arabidopsis lines of TaWRKY13 have a longer root and a larger root surface area than the control (Columbia-0). Furthermore, TaWRKY13 overexpression rice lines exhibited salt tolerance compared with the control, as evidenced by increased proline (Pro) and decreased malondialdehyde (MDA) contents under salt treatment. The roots of overexpression lines were also more developed. These results demonstrate that TaWRKY13 plays a positive role in salt stress."

"32821225","abstracttext","Biolistic transformation systems are widely used to introduce foreign genes into common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.); however, these techniques often generate high transgene copy numbers and complex transgene integration patterns that hinder the stable expression of the transgenes. To improve the efficiency of stable transgene expression, we examined the effect of low-temperature pretreatment of wheat flower spikes and of high maltose concentration (HMC) in the medium during the subsequent callus culture. Tillers of the spring wheat cultivar Bobwhite were stored at 5°C without water for one week before the isolation of their immature scutellar tissues, and the resulting particle-bombarded explants were cultured on 15% maltose for a month. Together, these treatments significantly increased the number of recovered transgenic lines expressing the reporter gene. The low-temperature pretreatment eliminated the negative effects of HMC, and HMC improved the efficiency of stable transgene expression. Southern blot analysis revealed that transgenic lines recovered after HMC treatment integrated a lower copy number of transgenes than those cultured at normal (4%) maltose concentration. These findings suggest that the HMC-mediated reduction of the transgene copy number results from the suppression of plasmid DNA rearrangement before or during transgene integration into the wheat genome."

"33239669","abstracttext","Crop productivity must increase at unprecedented rates to meet the needs of the growing worldwide population. Exploiting natural variation for the genetic improvement of crops plays a central role in increasing productivity. Although current genomic technologies can be used for high-throughput identification of genetic variation, methods for efficiently exploiting this genetic potential in a targeted, systematic manner are lacking. Here, we developed a haplotype-based approach to identify genetic diversity for crop improvement using genome assemblies from 15 bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars. We used stringent criteria to identify identical-by-state haplotypes and distinguish these from near-identical sequences (~99.95% identity). We showed that each cultivar shares ~59 % of its genome with other sequenced cultivars and we detected the presence of extended haplotype blocks containing hundreds to thousands of genes across all wheat chromosomes. We found that genic sequence alone was insufficient to fully differentiate between haplotypes, as were commonly used array-based genotyping chips due to their gene centric design. We successfully used this approach for focused discovery of novel haplotypes from a landrace collection and documented their potential for trait improvement in modern bread wheat. This study provides a framework for defining and exploiting haplotypes to increase the efficiency and precision of wheat breeding towards optimising the agronomic performance of this crucial crop."

The pipeline integrates reference-assisted loci and de novo assembly strategies to construct high-quality sequences focused on gene content. Pipeline validation was conducted with wheat (Triticum aestivum), a hexaploid species, using barley (Hordeum vulgare) as reference, that resulted in the identification of more than 90% of genes and several new genes. Moreover, PGA was used to assemble gene content in Saccharum spontaneum species, a parental lineage for hybrid sugarcane cultivars. Saccharum spontaneum gene sequence obtained was used to reference-guided transcriptome analysis of six different tissues. A total of 39,234 genes were identified, 60.4% clustered into known grass gene families. Thirty-seven gene families were expanded when compared with other grasses, three of them highlighted by the number of gene copies potentially involved in initial development and stress response. In addition, 3,108 promoters (many showing tissue specificity) were identified in this work. In summary, PGA can reconstruct high-quality gene sequences from polyploid genomes, as shown for wheat and S. spontaneum species, and it is more efficient than conventional genome assemblers using low coverage DNA sequencing."

"24487977","abstracttext_key message","Stripe rust resistance transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium into common wheat was controlled by a single dominant gene, which mapped to chromosome 1B near Yr26 and was designated YrL693. Stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is a highly destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Stripe rust resistance was transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium to common wheat, and the resulting introgression line (L693) exhibited all-stage resistance to the widely virulent and predominant Chinese pathotypes CYR32 and CYR33 and to the new virulent pathotype V26. There was no cytological evidence that L693 had alien chromosomal segments from Th. intermedium. Genetic analysis of stripe rust resistance was performed by crossing L693 with the susceptible line L661. F(1), F(2), and F(2:3) populations from reciprocal crosses showed that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. A total 479 F(2:3) lines and 781 pairs of genomic simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were employed to determine the chromosomal location of the resistance gene. The gene was linked to six publicly available and three recently developed wheat genomic SSR markers. The linked markers were localized to wheat chromosome 1B using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines, and the resistance gene was localized to chromosome 1B based on SSR and wheat genomic information. A high-density genetic map was also produced. The pedigree, molecular marker data, and resistance response indicated that the stripe rust resistance gene in L693 is a novel gene, which was temporarily designated YrL693. The SSR markers that co-segregate with this gene (Xbarc187-1B, Xbarc187-1B-1, Xgwm18-1B, and Xgwm11-1B) have potential application in marker-assisted breeding of wheat, and YrL693 will be useful for broadening the genetic basis of stripe rust resistance in wheat."

In wheat many major leaf rust resistance genes have been overcome by virulent races. In contrast, the prehaustorial resistance (phr) against wheat leaf rust detected in the diploid wheat Einkorn ( Triticum monoccocum var. monococcum ) accession PI272560 confers race-independent resistance against isolates virulent on accessions harboring resistance genes located on the A-genome of Triticum aestivum . Phr in PI272560 leads to abortion of fungal development during the formation of haustorial mother cells and to increased hydrogen peroxide concentration in comparison to the susceptible accession 36554 ( Triticum boeoticum ssp. thaoudar var. reuteri ). Increased peroxidase and endochitinase activity was detected in PI272560 within 6 h after inoculation (hai). Comparative transcriptome profiling using Massive Analysis of cDNA Ends (MACE) in infected and non-infected leaves detected 14220 differentially expressed tags in PI272560 and 15472 in accession 36554. Of these 2908 and 3004, respectively, could be assigned to Gene Ontology (GO) categories of which 463 were detected in both accessions and 311 were differentially expressed between the accessions. In accordance with the concept of non-host resistance in PI272560, genes with similarity to peroxidases, chitinases, β-1,3-glucanases and other pathogenesis-related genes were up-regulated within the first 8 hai, whereas up-regulation of such genes was delayed in 36554. Moreover, a Phosphoribulokinase gene contributing to non-host resistance in rice against stripe rust was exclusively expressed in the resistant accession PI272560. Gene expression underpinned physiological and phenotypic observations at the site of infection and are in accordance with the concept of non-host resistance."

"10859191","abstracttext","The endosperm of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum [L.]) was shown to contain a high molecular weight starch synthase (SS) analogous to the product of the maize du1 gene, starch synthase III (SSIII; DU1). cDNA and genomic DNA sequences encoding wheat SSIII were isolated and characterized. The wheat SSIII cDNA is 5,346 bp long and contains an open reading frame that encodes a 1,628-amino acid polypeptide. A putative N-terminal transit peptide, a 436-amino acid C-terminal catalytic domain, and a central 470-amino acid SSIII-specific domain containing three regions of repeated amino acid similarity were identified in the wheat gene. A fourth region between the transit peptide and the SSIII-specific domain contains repeat motifs that are variable with respect to motif sequence and repeat number between wheat and maize. In dicots, this N-terminal region does not contain repeat motifs and is truncated. The gene encoding wheat SSIII, designated ss3, consists of 16 exons extending over 10 kb, and is located on wheat chromosome I. Expression of ss3 mRNA in wheat was detected in leaves, pre-anthesis florets, and from very early to middle stage of endosperm development. The entire N-terminal variable repeat region and the majority of the SSIII-specific domain are encoded on a single 2,703-bp exon. A gene encoding a class III SS from the Arabidopsis genome sequencing project shows a strongly conserved exon structure to the wheat ss3 gene, with the exception of the N-terminal region. The evolutionary relationships of the genes encoding monocot and dicot class III SSs are discussed."

"17468807","abstracttext","Wheat polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is the major cause of browning reactions that discolor Asian noodles and other wheat products. It has been hypothesized that genes encoding wheat PPOs may have evolved by gene duplication into a multigene family. Here we characterized PPO genomic sequences from diploid (Triticum monococcum, T. urartu, Aegilops tauschii, and Ae. speltoides), tetraploid (T. turgidum, subspecies dicoccoides and durum) and hexaploid (T. aestivum cultivars Klasic and ID377s) wheat species to gain a better understanding of the structure and organization of PPO genes. DNA fragments were amplified from a highly polymorphic and phylogenetic informative region of the gene. As a result, we obtained highly discriminative sequences. Three distinct PPOs, obtained from the A genome of T. monococcum, provided evidence for gene duplication events (paralogous loci). Furthermore, the number of sequences obtained for bread and durum wheat was higher than the expected number of orthologous loci. Sequence comparison revealed nucleotide and structural diversity, and detected five sequence intron types, all with a common insertion position. This was hypothesized to be homologous to that of intron 2 of previously reported wheat PPOs. A MITE of the Stowaway family accounted for the major difference between the five intervening sequences, and was unique to T. aestivum cv. Klasic. Nucleotide and structural diversity, together with well-resolved phylogenetic trees, provided molecular evidence to support the hypothesis of a PPO multigene family structure and organization."

Infection by Bgt triggered a more robust alteration in gene expression in N9134 compared with the response to Pst infection. An array of overlapping gene clusters with distinctive expression patterns provided insight into the regulatory differences in the responses to Bgt and Pst infection. The differentially expressed genes were grouped into seven enriched Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways in Bgt-infected leaves and four pathways in Pst-infected leaves, while only two pathways overlapped. In the plant-pathogen interaction pathway, N9134 activated a higher number of genes and pathways in response to Bgt infection than in response to Pst invasion.

"33228297","abstracttext","Parastagonospora (syn. ana, Stagonospora; teleo, Phaeosphaeria) nodorum (Berk.) Quaedvleig, Verkley & Crous is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that causes the disease Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) on wheat (Triticum aestivum L. subsp. aestivum). The fungus produces necrotrophic effectors (NEs) that cause cell death when recognized by corresponding host genes, which ultimately leads to disease. To date, eight host gene-NE interactions have been described in the wheat-P. nodorum system. Here, we report the identification and partial characterization of a ninth interaction involving a P. nodorum-produced NE designated SnTox7 and a wheat gene designated Snn7. SnTox7 is a small protein with an estimated size less than 30 kDa and largely resistant to heat and chemical treatment. The Snn7 gene governs sensitivity to SnTox7 and was delineated to a 2.7-cM interval on the long arm of wheat chromosome 2D. The Snn7-SnTox7 interaction explained 33% of the variation in disease among a segregating population, indicating that the interaction plays a prominent role in the development of SNB. The Snn7 sensitivity allele was identified in the hexaploid wheat cultivar Timstein, but evaluation of a set of 52 hexaploid lines of diverse origin indicated that few genotypes harbored a functional Snn7 allele, thus indicating that Snn7 is relatively rare. The identification of the Snn7-SnTox7 interaction adds to our knowledge of the wheat-P. nodorum pathosystem, which has become a model for necrotrophic specialist fungal pathogens and their interactions with plants leading to necrotrophic effector-triggered susceptibility."

In a previous study, we transferred the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm57 from Aegilops searsii into common wheat and cytogenetically mapped the gene in a chromosome region with the fraction length (FL) 0.75-0.87, which represents 12% segment of the long arm of chromosome 2S s #1. In this study, we performed RNA-seq using RNA extracted from leaf samples of three infected and mock-infected wheat- Ae . searsii 2S s #1 introgression lines at 0, 12, 24, and 48 h after inoculation with Bgt isolates. Then we designed 79 molecular markers based on transcriptome sequences and physically mapped them to Ae . searsii chromosome 2S s #1- in seven intervals. We used these markers to identify 46 wheat- Ae . searsii 2S s #1 recombinants induced by ph1b , a deletion mutant of pairing homologous ( Ph ) genes. After analyzing the 46 ph1b -induced 2S s #1L recombinants in the region where Pm57 is located with different Bgt -responses, we physically mapped Pm57 gene on the long arm of 2S s #1 in a 5.13 Mb genomic region, which was flanked by markers X67593 (773.72 Mb) and X62492 (778.85 Mb).

Stripe rust and powdery mildew are the most damaging of the fungal diseases that afflict wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). However, studies on Triticum aestivum NAC ( TaNAC ) s ' role in resistance to the two diseases are still limited, especially in an overall comparative analysis of TaNACs responding or not to fungal stress. In the present study, 186 TaNAC transcripts were obtained from the resistant hexaploid wheat line N9134 under fungal stress, and 180 new transcripts were submitted to GenBank. Statistical results show that 35.1% (54/154) of TaNAC genes responded to stripe rust and powdery mildew in the seedling stage. ""Abnormal"" coding transcripts of differentially expressed (DE)-TaNAC genes in wheat responding to fungal stress were found in a significantly higher proportion (24/117 vs. 8/69, p = 0.0098) than in non-DE-NACs. This hinted that the alternative splicing of TaNAC genes was active in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation during plant-pathogen interactions. Full-length NAC proteins were classified into nine groups via phylogenetic analysis. Multiple-sequence alignment revealed diversity in the C-terminal structural organization, but the differentially expressed gene (DEG)-encoding proteins enriched in Subgroups VI and VII were conserved, with WV[L/V]CR amino acid residues in Motif 7 following the NAM domain. Our data that showed TaNAC TFs responded to fungal disease, which was affected by expression levels and by the regulation of multifarious transcript variants. These data for TaNAC responses to stripe rust and/or powdery mildew and their numerous structural variants provide a good resource for NAC function-mechanism analysis in the context of biotic-stress tolerance in wheat."

"17543110","abstracttext_background","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small, non-coding regulatory RNAs that regulate gene expression by guiding target mRNA cleavage or translational inhibition. So far, identification of miRNAs has been limited to a few model plant species, such as Arabidopsis, rice and Populus, whose genomes have been sequenced. Wheat is one of the most important cereal crops worldwide. To date, only a few conserved miRNAs have been predicted in wheat and the computational identification of wheat miRNAs requires the genome sequence, which is unknown."
"17543110","abstracttext_results","To identify novel as well as conserved miRNAs in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we constructed a small RNA library. High throughput sequencing of the library and subsequent analysis revealed the identification of 58 miRNAs, comprising 43 miRNA families. Of these, 35 miRNAs belong to 20 conserved miRNA families. The remaining 23 miRNAs are novel and form 23 miRNA families in wheat; more importantly, 4 of these new miRNAs (miR506, miR510, miR514 and miR516) appear to be monocot-specific. Northern blot analysis indicated that some of the new miRNAs are preferentially expressed in certain tissues. Based on sequence homology, we predicted 46 potential targets. Thus, we have identified a large number of monocot-specific and wheat-specific miRNAs. These results indicate that both conserved and wheat-specific miRNAs play important roles in wheat growth and development, stress responses and other physiological processes."

"25208643","abstracttext_key message","QTLs controlling yield-related traits were mapped using a population derived from common wheat and Tibetan semi-wild wheat and they provided valuable information for using Tibetan semi-wild wheat in future wheat molecular breeding. Tibetan semi-wild wheat (Triticum aestivum ssp tibetanum Shao) is a kind of primitive hexaploid wheat and harbors several beneficial traits, such as tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. And as a wild relative of common wheat, heterosis of yield of the progeny between them was significant. This study focused on mapping QTLs controlling yield-related traits using a recombined inbred lines (RILs) population derived from a hybrid between a common wheat line NongDa3331 (ND3331) and the Tibetan semi-wild wheat accession Zang 1817. In nine location-year environments, a total of 148 putative QTLs controlling nine traits were detected, distributed on 19 chromosomes except for 1A and 2D. Single QTL explained the phenotypic variation ranging from 3.12 to 49.95%. Of these QTLs, 56 were contributed by Zang 1817. Some stable QTLs contributed by Zang 1817 were also detected in more than four environments, such as QPh-3A1, QPh-4B1 and QPh-4D for plant height, QSl-7A1 for spike length, QEp-4B2 for ears per plant, QGws-4D for grain weight per spike, and QTgw-4D for thousand grain weight. Several QTL-rich Regions were also identified, especially on the homoeologous group 4. The TaANT gene involved in floral organ development was mapped on chromosome 4A between Xksm71 and Xcfd6 with 0.8 cM interval, and co-segregated with the QTLs controlling floret number per spikelet, explaining 4.96-11.84% of the phenotypic variation. The current study broadens our understanding of the genetic characterization of Tibetan semi-wild wheat, which will enlarge the genetic diversity of yield-related traits in modern wheat breeding program."

"26813794","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by the biotrophic fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a major limitation for the production of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). However, to date, the transcriptional regulation of bread wheat defense against powdery mildew remains largely unknown. Here, we report the function and molecular mechanism of the bread wheat Mediator subunit 25 (TaMED25) in regulating the bread wheat immune response signaling pathway. Three homoalleles of TaMED25 from bread wheat were identified and mapped to chromosomes 5A, 5B, and 5D, respectively. We show that knockdown of TaMED25 by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing reduced bread wheat susceptibility to the powdery mildew fungus during the compatible plant-pathogen interaction. Moreover, our results indicate that MED25 may play a conserved role in regulating bread wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare) susceptibility to powdery mildew. Similarly, bread wheat ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3-LIKE1 (TaEIL1), an ortholog of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3, negatively regulates bread wheat resistance against powdery mildew. Using various approaches, we demonstrate that the conserved activator-interacting domain of TaMED25 interacts physically with the separate amino- and carboxyl-terminal regions of TaEIL1, contributing to the transcriptional activation activity of TaEIL1. Furthermore, we show that TaMED25 and TaEIL1 synergistically activate ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR1 (TaERF1) transcription to modulate bread wheat basal disease resistance to B. graminis f. sp. tritici by repressing the expression of pathogenesis-related genes and deterring the accumulation of reactive oxygen species. Collectively, we identify the TaMED25-TaEIL1-TaERF1 signaling module as a negative regulator of bread wheat resistance to powdery mildew."
"30542338","articletitle","Symbiosis Specificity of the Preceding Host Plant Can Dominate but Not Obliterate the Association Between Wheat and Its Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungal Partners."
"30542338","abstracttext","The symbiosis established between arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and roots of most land plants plays a key role in plant nutrient acquisition and alleviation of environmental stresses. Despite the ubiquity of the symbiosis, AMF and host species display significant specificity in their interactions. To clarify preferential associations between wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and AMF, we characterized root AMF communities in the transition from two first host species, ryegrass ( Lolium rigidum ) and yellow-serradella ( Ornithopus compressus ), grown separately or together, to a second host (wheat), by sequencing the large subunit ribosomal DNA (LSU rDNA) gene. The response of AMF communities in wheat to prior soil disturbance - and consequently of the mycelial network [intact extraradical mycelium (ERM) vs. disrupted mycelium] established with either of the first hosts - was also investigated. Since the outcome of a specific host-symbiont interaction depends on the molecular responses of the host plant upon microbial colonization, we studied the expression of six key symbiosis-related genes in wheat roots. AMF communities on L. rigidum and O. compressus roots were clearly distinct. Within an undisturbed ERM, wheat AMF communities were similar to that of previous host, and O. compressus -wheat-AMF interactions supported a greater growth of wheat than L. rigidum -wheat-AMF interactions. This effect declined when ERM was disrupted, but generated a greater activation of symbiotic genes in wheat, indicating that plant symbiotic program depends on some extent on the colonizing symbiont propagule type. When a mixture of L. rigidum and O. compressus was planted, the wheat colonization pattern resembled that of O. compressus , although this was not reflected in a greater growth. These results show a lasting effect of previous hosts in shaping wheat AMF communities through an efficient use of the established ERM, although not completely obliterating host-symbiont specificity."

"24069228","abstracttext_background","Nitrogen uptake and the efficient absorption and metabolism of nitrogen are essential elements in attempts to breed improved cereal cultivars for grain or silage production. One of the enzymes related to nitrogen metabolism is glutamine-2-oxoglutarate amidotransferase (GOGAT). Together with glutamine synthetase (GS), GOGAT maintains the flow of nitrogen from NH4 (+) into glutamine and glutamate, which are then used for several aminotransferase reactions during amino acid synthesis."
"24069228","abstracttext_results","The aim of the present work was to identify and analyse the structure of wheat NADH-GOGAT genomic sequences, and study the expression in two durum wheat cultivars characterized by low and high kernel protein content. The genomic sequences of the three homoeologous A, B and D NADH-GOGAT genes were obtained for hexaploid Triticum aestivum and the tetraploid A and B genes of Triticum turgidum ssp. durum. Analysis of the gene sequences indicates that all wheat NADH-GOGAT genes are composed of 22 exons and 21 introns. The three hexaploid wheat homoeologous genes have high conservation of sequence except intron 13 which shows differences in both length and sequence. A comparative analysis of sequences among di- and mono-cotyledonous plants shows both regions of high conservation and of divergence. qRT-PCR performed with the two durum wheat cvs Svevo and Ciccio (characterized by high and low protein content, respectively) indicates different expression levels of the two NADH-GOGAT-3A and NADH-GOGAT-3B genes."
"24069228","abstracttext_conclusion","The three hexaploid wheat homoeologous NADH-GOGAT gene sequences are highly conserved - consistent with the key metabolic role of this gene. However, the dicot and monocot amino acid sequences show distinctive patterns, particularly in the transit peptide, the exon 16-17 junction, and the C-terminus. The lack of conservation in the transit peptide may indicate subcellular differences between the two plant divisions - while the sequence conservation within enzyme functional domains remains high. Higher expression levels of NADH-GOGAT are associated with higher grain protein content in two durum wheats."
"14756761","articletitle","Genome analysis at different ploidy levels allows cloning of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3b from hexaploid wheat."
"14756761","abstracttext","In wheat, race-specific resistance to the fungal pathogen powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) is controlled by the Pm genes. There are 10 alleles conferring resistance at the Pm3 locus (Pm3a to Pm3j) on chromosome 1AS of hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The genome of hexaploid wheat has a size of 1.6 x 1010 bp and contains more than 80% of repetitive sequences, making positional cloning difficult. Here, we demonstrate that the combined analysis of genomes from wheat species with different ploidy levels can be exploited for positional cloning in bread wheat. We have mapped the Pm3b gene in hexaploid wheat to a genetic interval of 0.97 centimorgan (cM). The diploid T. monococcum and the tetraploid T. turgidum ssp. durum provided models for the A genome of hexaploid wheat and allowed to establish a physical contig spanning the Pm3 locus. Although the haplotypes at the Pm3 locus differed markedly between the three species, a large resistance gene-like family specific to wheat group 1 chromosomes was consistently found at the Pm3 locus. A candidate gene for Pm3b was identified using partial sequence conservation between resistant line Chul and T. monococcum cv. DV92. A susceptible Pm3b mutant, carrying a single-base pair deletion in the coding region of the candidate gene was isolated. When tested in a single cell transformation assay, the Pm3b candidate gene conferred race-specific resistance to powdery mildew. These results demonstrate that the candidate gene, a member of the coiled-coil nucleotide binding site leucine-rich repeat (NBS-LRR) type of disease resistance genes, is the Pm3b gene."
"28005310","articletitle","The Lr34 adult plant rust resistance gene provides seedling resistance in durum wheat without senescence."
"28005310","abstracttext","The hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) adult plant resistance gene, Lr34/Yr18/Sr57/Pm38/Ltn1, provides broad-spectrum resistance to wheat leaf rust (Lr34), stripe rust (Yr18), stem rust (Sr57) and powdery mildew (Pm38) pathogens, and has remained effective in wheat crops for many decades. The partial resistance provided by this gene is only apparent in adult plants and not effective in field-grown seedlings. Lr34 also causes leaf tip necrosis (Ltn1) in mature adult plant leaves when grown under field conditions. This D genome-encoded bread wheat gene was transferred to tetraploid durum wheat (T. turgidum) cultivar Stewart by transformation. Transgenic durum lines were produced with elevated gene expression levels when compared with the endogenous hexaploid gene. Unlike nontransgenic hexaploid and durum control lines, these transgenic plants showed robust seedling resistance to pathogens causing wheat leaf rust, stripe rust and powdery mildew disease. The effectiveness of seedling resistance against each pathogen correlated with the level of transgene expression. No evidence of accelerated leaf necrosis or up-regulation of senescence gene markers was apparent in these seedlings, suggesting senescence is not required for Lr34 resistance, although leaf tip necrosis occurred in mature plant flag leaves. Several abiotic stress-response genes were up-regulated in these seedlings in the absence of rust infection as previously observed in adult plant flag leaves of hexaploid wheat. Increasing day length significantly increased Lr34 seedling resistance. These data demonstrate that expression of a highly durable, broad-spectrum adult plant resistance gene can be modified to provide seedling resistance in durum wheat."

Chromosomal breakpoints for known ancestral reciprocal translocations involving these chromosomes and for a known pericentric inversion on chromosome 4A were localized by linkage and aneuploid analysis. Known genes mapped include the major vernalization genes Vrn1 and Vrn3 on chromosome arms 5AL and 5DL, the red-coleoptile gene Rc1 on 7AS, and presumptively the leaf-rust (Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici) resistance gene Lr34 on 7DS and the kernel-hardness gene Ha on 5DS.

"11154343","articletitle","Regulation of a wheat actin-depolymerizing factor during cold acclimation."
"11154343","abstracttext","We have previously shown that the wheat (Triticum aestivum) TaADF gene expression level is correlated with the plants capacity to tolerate freezing. Sequence analysis revealed that this gene encodes a protein homologous to members of the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF)/cofilin family. We report here on the characterization of the recombinant TaADF protein. Assays for ADF activity showed that TaADF is capable of sequestering actin, preventing nucleotide exchange, and inducing actin depolymerization. In vitro phosphorylation studies showed that TaADF is a substrate for a wheat 52-kD kinase. The activity of this kinase is modulated by low temperature during the acclimation period. Western-blot analyses revealed that TaADF is expressed only in cold-acclimated Gramineae species and that the accumulation level is much higher in the freezing-tolerant wheat cultivars compared with the less tolerant ones. This accumulation was found to be regulated by a factor(s) encoded by a gene(s) located on chromosome 5A, the chromosome most often found to be associated with cold hardiness. The induction of an active ADF during cold acclimation and the correlation with an increased freezing tolerance suggest that the protein may be required for the cytoskeletal rearrangements that may occur upon low temperature exposure. These remodelings might be important for the enhancement of freezing tolerance."

"12244437","abstracttext","Carboxypeptidases expressed in the aleurone layer participate in the mobilization of endosperm storage proteins during cereal grain germination. The genes encoding these proteins are also expressed in the scutellum of germinating grains, but their function in this organ is not yet clear. We have analyzed the expression of a carboxypeptidase III (CPIII) gene in germinating wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grains. CPIII transcripts accumulated transiently in the scutellum showing a maximum at 2-3 days after imbibition and were exclusively localized to the scutellar vascular tissue. The analysis of CPIII expression in developing shoots and roots from growing seedlings confirmed the localization of CPIII transcripts to differentiating vascular tissue. The TUNEL assay detected in situ nuclear DNA fragmentation in cells showing CPIII expression, indicating that they undergo programmed cell death. Relative RT-PCR analysis showed that the CPIII gene expressed at high level in aleurone cells is the one expressed in vegetative tissues, and allowed the use of this gene as a molecular marker of tracheary element differentiation in wheat seedlings. These results are indicative of the involvement of serine carboxypeptidases in programmed cell death during the development of the vascular tissue in wheat, a new role for these enzymes, besides the mobilization of starchy-endosperm proteins during germination."

"12231889","abstracttext","Improvement of wheat (Triticum aestivum) by biotechnological approaches is currently limited by a lack of efficient and reliable transformation methodology. In this report, we detail a protocol for transformation of a highly embryogenic wheat cultivar, Bobwhite. Calli derived from immature embryos, 0.5 to 1 mm long, were bombarded with microprojectiles coated with DNA containing as marker genes the bar gene, encoding phosphinothricin-resistance, and the gene encoding [beta]-glucuronidase (GUS), each under control of a maize ubiquitin promoter. The bombardment was performed 5 d after embryo excision, just after initiation of callus proliferation. The ability of plantlets to root in the presence of 1 or 3 mg/L of bialaphos was the most reliable selection criteria used to identify transformed plants. Stable transformation was confirmed by marker gene expression assays and the presence of the bar sequences in high molecular weight chromosomal DNA of the resultant plants. Nine independent lines of fertile transgenic wheat plants have been obtained thus far, at a frequency of 1 to 2 per 1000 embryos bombarded. On average, 168 d elapsed between embryo excision for bombardment and anthesis of the T0 plants. The transmission of both the resistance phenotype and bar DNA to the T1 generation verified that germline transformation had occurred."

"14701921","abstracttext","Heading time in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is determined by three characters: vernalization requirement, photoperiodic sensitivity and narrow-sense earliness, which are involved in the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth. We identified and characterized the APETALA1 (AP1)-like MADS box gene in wheat (WAP1) as an activator of phase transition. Its expression starts just before the phase transition and is maintained during the reproductive phase. Inhibition of WAP1 expression in the transgenic plants by co-suppression affected neither vernalization requirement nor photoperiodic sensitivity, but resulted in delayed narrow-sense earliness, indicating that WAP1 accelerates autonomous phase transition. Analyses of the WAP1 expression in the near-isogenic lines (NILs) for spring habit genes (Vrn) revealed that WAP1 transcripts were induced by vernalization strongly in the NILs with Vrn dominant alleles and weakly with the recessive alleles. Furthermore, WAP1 expression was up-regulated by a long photoperiod in both NILs with and those without a photoperiod-insensitive gene (Ppd). These results suggest that WAP1 is a key gene in the regulatory pathway controlling the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in wheat."

"18528518","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), with a large genome (16000 Mb) and high proportion ( approximately 80%) of repetitive sequences, has been a difficult crop for genomics research. However, the availability of extensive cytogenetics stocks has been an asset, which facilitated significant progress in wheat genomic research in recent years. For instance, fairly dense molecular maps (both genetic and physical maps) and a large set of ESTs allowed genome-wide identification of gene-rich and gene-poor regions as well as QTL including eQTL. The availability of markers associated with major economic traits also allowed development of major programs on marker-assisted selection (MAS) in some countries, and facilitated map-based cloning of a number of genes/QTL. Resources for functional genomics including TILLING and RNA interference (RNAi) along with some new approaches like epigenetics and association mapping are also being successfully used for wheat genomics research. BAC/BIBAC libraries for the subgenome D and some individual chromosomes have also been prepared to facilitate sequencing of gene space. In this brief review, we discuss all these advances in some detail, and also describe briefly the available resources, which can be used for future genomics research in this important crop."

"18944865","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar Pavon 76 carries slow-rusting resistance to leaf rust that has remained effective in Mexico since its release in 1976. 'Pavon 76' was crossed with two leaf rust-susceptible wheat cultivars, Jupateco 73S and Avocet S, and between 118 and 148 individual F(2) plant-derived F(3) and F(5) lines were evaluated for adult-plant leaf rust resistance at two field sites in Mexico during different seasons. Evaluation of F(1) plants and parents indicated that the slow-rusting resistance was partially dominant. Segregation in the F(3) and F(5) indicated that the resistance was based on two genes with additive effects. Monosomic analysis was carried out to determine the chromosomal locations of the resistance genes. For this purpose, two or three backcross-derived cytogenetic populations were developed by crossing 'Pavon 76' with a monosomic series of adult-plant leaf rust-susceptible cultivar Lal-bahadur. Evaluation of such BC(2)F(3) and BC(3)F(3) lines from 16 confirmed 'Lalbahadur' monosomics indicated that one slow-rusting gene was located in chromosome 1B of 'Pavon 76'. This gene, designated as Lr46, is the second named gene involved in slow-rusting resistance to leaf rust in wheat."
"18826431","articletitle","TaASY1 promotes homologous chromosome interactions and is affected by deletion of Ph1."
"18826431","abstracttext","During meiosis, chromosomes are sorted into homologous pairs as a preface to their intimate association via recombination and synapsis. However, little is known about the mechanism used to distinguish homologous chromosomes from other chromosomes present in the nucleus. Studies in wheat (Triticum aestivum) have shown that the Pairing homoeologous 1 (Ph1) locus is required to suppress interactions between genetically similar homoeologous chromosomes. Here we show that absence of Ph1 causes increased transcription of Asynapsis 1 (ASY1), a gene that encodes an axial-element-associated protein that is essential for synapsis and cross-over formation in Arabidopsis and rice. Localisation of ASY1 during meiosis is also affected by deletion of Ph1. In addition, transgenic wheat mutants with decreased activity of TaASY1 display reduced synapsis during prophase I and exhibit pairing between homoeologous chromosomes at metaphase I. These results suggest that ASY1 is required to promote interactions between homologous chromosomes in bread wheat, and that Ph1 has a gene regulatory role, which is consistent with its suggested genetic identity as a Cdk-like gene. Broader implications of this research suggest that we could use the Taasy1 mutants to assess their efficacy in alien chromatin introgression studies, as seen with the ph1b mutant."

"17110121","abstracttext","Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are often used as a marker of plant defense reactions. Some endo-1,3-beta-glucanase (Gns) genes encode proteins that belong to the PR protein family 2 (PR-2). Although the number of homologous family member genes is significantly greater in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) compared to other model plants, earlier studies did not evaluate the possible contribution of their homologs to hybridization signals in Northern blot analysis. In this study, we have examined whether routine transcriptional analyses of a PR gene is of high reliability or not by isolating six highly similar Gns genes (TaGlb2a, TaGlb2b, TaGlb2c, TaGlb2d, TaGlb2e, and TaGlb2f) and characterizing their expression patterns in detail. While TaGlb2b was shown to be a PR-2 gene, transcription of TaGlb2c and TaGlb2d was not induced upon infection with either powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis) or head blight (Fusarium graminearum) pathogens; their transcripts were most abundant in healthy spikes (lemmas and in particular paleae). Therefore, in some cases, the conventional analyses do not necessarily provide accurate information on expression pattern of a PR gene in hexaploid wheat. This is also the first report of wheat genes that are specifically expressed in lemma/palea tissues of flowering spikelets."

"23266949","abstracttext","The ascomycete Fusarium graminearum is a destructive fungal pathogen of wheat (Triticum aestivum). To better understand how this pathogen proliferates within the host plant, we tracked pathogen growth inside wheat coleoptiles and then examined pathogen gene expression inside wheat coleoptiles at 16, 40, and 64 h after inoculation (HAI) using laser capture microdissection and microarray analysis. We identified 344 genes that were preferentially expressed during invasive growth in planta. Gene expression profiles for 134 putative plant cell wall-degrading enzyme genes suggest that there was limited cell wall degradation at 16 HAI and extensive degradation at 64 HAI. Expression profiles for genes encoding reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related enzymes suggest that F. graminearum primarily scavenges extracellular ROS before a later burst of extracellular ROS is produced by F. graminearum enzymes. Expression patterns of genes involved in primary metabolic pathways suggest that F. graminearum relies on the glyoxylate cycle at an early stage of plant infection. A secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster was specifically induced at 64 HAI and was required for virulence. Our results indicate that F. graminearum initiates infection of coleoptiles using covert penetration strategies and switches to overt cellular destruction of tissues at an advanced stage of infection."

"26469859","abstracttext","Calreticulin (CRT) is a highly conserved and abundant multifunctional protein that is encoded by a small gene family and is often associated with abiotic/biotic stress responses in plants. However, the roles played by this protein in salt stress responses in wheat (Triticum aestivum) remain obscure. In this study, three TaCRT genes were identified in wheat and named TaCRT1, TaCRT2 and TaCRT3-1 based on their sequence characteristics and their high homology to other known CRT genes. Quantitative real-time PCR expression data revealed that these three genes exhibit different expression patterns in different tissues and are strongly induced under salt stress in wheat. The calcium-binding properties of the purified recombinant TaCRT1 protein were determined using a PIPES/Arsenazo III analysis. TaCRT1 gene overexpression in Nicotiana tabacum decreased salt stress damage in transgenic tobacco plants. Physiological measurements indicated that transgenic tobacco plants showed higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) than non-transgenic tobacco under normal growth conditions. Interestingly, overexpression of the entire TaCRT1 gene or of partial TaCRT1 segments resulted in significantly higher tolerance to salt stress in transgenic plants compared with their WT counterparts, thus revealing the essential role of the C-domain of TaCRT1 in countering salt stress in plants."

Despite extensive genetic and biochemical characterization, the molecular genetic basis underlying the biosynthesis of β-diketones remains unclear. Here, we discovered that the wheat W1 locus contains a metabolic gene cluster mediating β-diketone biosynthesis. The cluster comprises genes encoding proteins of several families including type-III polyketide synthases, hydrolases, and cytochrome P450s related to known fatty acid hydroxylases. The cluster region was identified in both genetic and physical maps of glaucous and glossy tetraploid wheat, demonstrating entirely different haplotypes in these accessions. Complementary evidence obtained through gene silencing in planta and heterologous expression in bacteria supports a model for a β-diketone biosynthesis pathway involving members of these three protein families. Mutations in homologous genes were identified in the barley eceriferum mutants defective in β-diketone biosynthesis, demonstrating a gene cluster also in the β-diketone biosynthesis Cer-cqu locus in barley. Hence, our findings open new opportunities to breed major cereal crops for surface features that impact yield and stress response."
"29148171","articletitle","Identification and expression profiling of Pht1 phosphate transporters in wheat in controlled environments and in the field."
"29148171","abstracttext","Phosphorus (P) is an important macronutrient with critical functions in plants. Phosphate (Pi) transporters, which mediate Pi acquisition and Pi translocation within the plant, are key factors in Pi deficiency responses. However, their relevance for adaptation to long-term Pi limitation under agronomic conditions, particularly in wheat, remains unknown. Here, we describe the identification of the complete Pi transporter gene family (Pht1) in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Gene expression profiles were compared for hydroponic and field-grown plant tissues of wheat at multiple development stages. Cis-element analysis of selected Pht1 promoter regions was performed. A broad range of expression patterns of individual TaPht1 genes was observed in relation to tissue specificity and the nutrient supply in the soil or in liquid culture, as well as an influence of the experimental system. The expression patterns indicate the involvement of specific transporters in Pi uptake, and in Pi transport and remobilisation within the plant, at different growth developmental stages. Specifically, the influence of Pi nutrition indicates a complex regulatory pattern of TaPht1 gene transcript abundances as a response to low Pi availability in different culture systems, correlating with the existence of different cis-acting promoter elements."

"30686238","abstracttext","Exploitation of host resistance is important for controlling powdery mildew of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, a wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium introgression line, designated WE99, conferred seedling resistance to 47 of 49 Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates. Genetic analysis demonstrated that the resistance segregation deviated significantly from a single gene Mendelian ratio. However, marker analysis indicated that only a single recessive resistance gene, temporarily designated PmWE99, conferred powdery mildew resistance (Pm). PmWE99 was mapped to chromosome arm 2BS and linked to the three simple-sequence repeat markers Gwm148, Gwm271, and Barc55. Using race spectrum analysis, PmWE99 was shown to be significantly different from the documented genes Pm42 and MlIW170 located on chromosome arm 2BS and, thus, appeared to be a new Pm gene. Examination of the genotype frequencies in the F 2:3 families showed that a genetic variation in the PmWE99 interval that favored the transmission of the WE99 allele could be the cause of the deviated segregation. Further investigation revealed that the abnormal segregation only occurred at the PmWE99 interval and was not common at other loci in this population. Identification of PmWE99 will increase the diversity of the Pm genes for wheat improvement."

"24318766","abstracttext","Brachypodium distachyon, is a new model plant for most cereal crops while gliadin is a class of wheat storage proteins related with wheat quality attributes. In the published B. distachyon genome sequence databases, no gliadin gene is found. In the current study, a number of gliadin genes in B. distachyon were isolated, which is contradictory to the results of genome sequencing projects. In our study, the B. distachyon seeds were found to have no gliadin protein expression by gel electrophoresis, reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography and Western blotting analysis. However, Southern blotting revealed a presence of more than ten copies of α-gliadin coding genes in B. distachyon. By means of AS-PCR amplification, four novel full-ORF α-gliadin genes, and 26 pseudogenes with at least one stop codon as well as their promoter regions were cloned and sequenced from different Brachypodium accessions. Sequence analysis revealed a few of single-nucleotide polymorphisms among these genes. Most pseudogenes were resulted from a C to T change, leading to the generation of TAG or TAA in-frame stop codon. To compare both the full-ORFs and the pseudogenes among Triticum and Triticum-related species, their structural characteristics were analyzed. Based on the four T cell stimulatory toxic epitopes and two ployglutamine domains, Aegilops, Triticum, and Brachypodium species were found to be more closely related. The phylogenetic analysis further revealed that B. distachyon was more closely related to Aegilops tauschii, Aegilops umbellulata, and the A or D genome of Triticum aestivum. The α-gliadin genes were able to express successfully in E. coli using the functional T7 promoter. The relative and absolute quantification of the transcripts of α-gliadin genes in wheat was much higher than that in B. distachyon. The abundant pseudogenes may affect the transcriptional and/or posttranscriptional level of the α-gliadin in B. distachyon."

"32392723","abstracttext","Barley mlo mutants are well known for their profound resistance against powdery mildew disease. Recently, mlo mutant plants were generated in hexaploid bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) with the help of transgenic (transcription-activator-like nuclease, TALEN) and non-transgenic (targeted induced local lesions in genomes, TILLING) biotechnological approaches. While full-gene knockouts in the three wheat Mlo ( TaMlo ) homoeologs, created via TALEN, confer full resistance to the wheat powdery mildew pathogen ( Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici ), the currently available TILLING-derived Tamlo missense mutants provide only partial protection against powdery mildew attack. Here, we studied the infection phenotypes of TALEN- and TILLING-derived Tamlo plants to the two hemibiotrophic pathogens Zymoseptoria tritici , causing Septoria leaf blotch in wheat, and Magnaporthe oryzae pv. Triticum ( MoT ), the causal agent of wheat blast disease. While Tamlo plants showed unaltered outcomes upon challenge with Z. tritici , we found evidence for allele-specific levels of enhanced susceptibility to MoT , with stronger powdery mildew resistance correlated with more invasive growth by the blast pathogen. Surprisingly, unlike barley mlo mutants, young wheat mlo mutant plants do not show undesired pleiotropic phenotypes such as spontaneous callose deposits in leaf mesophyll cells or signs of early leaf senescence. In conclusion, our study provides evidence for allele-specific levels of enhanced susceptibility of Tamlo plants to the hemibiotrophic wheat pathogen MoT ."
"31687913","articletitle","Transgenic Wheat Harboring an RNAi Element Confers Dual Resistance Against Synergistically Interacting Wheat Streak Mosaic Virus and Triticum Mosaic Virus."
"31687913","abstracttext","Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) and triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) are economically important viruses of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), causing significant yield losses in the Great Plains region of the United States. These two viruses are transmitted by wheat curl mites, which often leads to mixed infections with synergistic interaction in grower fields that exacerbates yield losses. Development of dual-resistant wheat lines would provide effective control of these two viruses. In this study, a genetic resistance strategy employing an RNA interference (RNAi) approach was implemented by assembling a hairpin element composed of a 202-bp (404-bp in total) stem sequence of the NIb (replicase) gene from each of WSMV and TriMV in tandem and of an intron sequence in the loop. The derived RNAi element was cloned into a binary vector and was used to transform spring wheat genotype CB037. Phenotyping of T 1 lineages across eight independent transgenic events for resistance revealed that i) two of the transgenic events provided resistance to WSMV and TriMV, ii) four events provided resistance to either WSMV or TriMV, and iii) no resistance was found in two other events. T 2 populations derived from the two events classified as dual-resistant were subsequently monitored for stability of the resistance phenotype through the T 4 generation. The resistance phenotype in these events was temperature-dependent, with a complete dual resistance at temperatures ≥25°C and an increasingly susceptible response at temperatures below 25°C. Northern blot hybridization of total RNA from transgenic wheat revealed that virus-specific small RNAs (vsRNAs) accumulated progressively with an increase in temperature, with no detectable levels of vsRNA accumulation at 20°C. Thus, the resistance phenotype of wheat harboring an RNAi element was correlated with accumulation of vsRNAs, and the generation of vsRNAs can be used as a molecular marker for the prediction of resistant phenotypes of transgenic plants at a specific temperature."

"23389776","abstracttext","Triticale is being considered as a bioindustrial crop in Canada using genetic modification. Because related spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) and durum wheat (T. durum) may exhibit synchronous flowering and grow in proximity, determination of interspecific gene flow when triticale is the pollen donor is necessary to evaluate potential risk. Pollen-mediated gene flow risk assessments generally rely on phenotypic markers to detect hybridization but DNA markers could be powerful and less ambiguous in quantifying rare interspecific gene flow. Six cultivars representing four species [spring wheat, durum wheat, triticale and rye (Secale cereale)] were screened with 235 spring wheat and 27 rye SSR markers to evaluate transferability and polymorphism. Fifty-five polymorphic markers were used in conjunction with morphological characterization to quantify interspecific gene flow from a blue aleurone (BA) triticale line to two spring wheat cultivars (AC Barrie and AC Crystal) and one durum wheat cultivar (AC Avonlea). Approximately 1.9 Million seeds from small plot experiments were visually screened in comparison with known hybrid seed. In total 2031 putative hybrids were identified and 448 germinated. Morphological analysis of putative hybrid plants identified five hybrids while molecular analysis identified 11 hybrids and two were common to both. Combined, 14 hybrids were confirmed: 10 spring wheat × triticale (0.0008 % of harvested seed): seven AC Barrie × BA triticale (0.001 %) and three AC Crystal × BA triticale (0.0005 %); and four durum wheat × triticale (0.0006 %). The occurrence of rare hybrids does not present a substantial risk to the development of GM triticale."
"27899932","articletitle","A Wheat Cinnamyl Alcohol Dehydrogenase TaCAD12 Contributes to Host Resistance to the Sharp Eyespot Disease."
"27899932","abstracttext","Sharp eyespot, caused mainly by the necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis , is a destructive disease in hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). In Arabidopsis , certain cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenases (CADs) have been implicated in monolignol biosynthesis and in defense response to bacterial pathogen infection. However, little is known about CADs in wheat defense responses to necrotrophic or soil-borne pathogens. In this study, we isolate a wheat CAD gene TaCAD12 in response to R. cerealis infection through microarray-based comparative transcriptomics, and study the enzyme activity and defense role of TaCAD12 in wheat. The transcriptional levels of TaCAD12 in sharp eyespot-resistant wheat lines were significantly higher compared with those in susceptible wheat lines. The sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that TaCAD12 belongs to IV group in CAD family. The biochemical assay proved that TaCAD12 protein is an authentic CAD enzyme and possesses catalytic efficiencies toward both coniferyl aldehyde and sinapyl aldehyde. Knock-down of TaCAD12 transcript significantly repressed resistance of the gene-silenced wheat plants to sharp eyespot caused by R. cerealis , whereas TaCAD12 overexpression markedly enhanced resistance of the transgenic wheat lines to sharp eyespot. Furthermore, certain defense genes ( Defensin, PR10, PR17c , and Chitinase1 ) and monolignol biosynthesis-related genes ( TaCAD1, TaCCR , and TaCOMT1 ) were up-regulated in the TaCAD12 -overexpressing wheat plants but down-regulated in TaCAD12 -silencing plants. These results suggest that TaCAD12 positively contributes to resistance against sharp eyespot through regulation of the expression of certain defense genes and monolignol biosynthesis-related genes in wheat."

"33143980","abstracttext","Metal-resistant bacteria can reduce Cd accumulation in plants, but mechanisms underlying this effect are poorly understood. In this study, a highly effective Cd-resistant WRS8 strain was obtained from the rhizoshere soil of Triticum aestivum L. Yangmai-13 and identified as Pseudomonas taiwanensis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Strain WRS8 was investigated for its effects on Cd availability and wheat tissue Cd contents and the related mechanisms using a hydroponic culture experiment. In strain WRS8-inoculated solution, the Cd concentration reduced and the pH and cell-adsorbed Cd increased with time. Strain WRS8 increased the wheat root and above-ground tissue dry weights by 11-36% compared to the controls. In strain WRS8-inoculated wheat plants, the Cd contents of the roots and above-ground tissues decreased by 78-85% and 88-94% and the Cd bioconcentration and translocation factors decreased by 78-85% and 46-58% at days 3 and 10, respectively, compared with the controls. The root surface-adsorbed Cd contents increased by 99-121% in the WRS8 strain-inoculated wheat plants at days 3 and 10 compared to the controls. Furthermore, strain WRS8 colonized the wheat root surfaces and interiors and reduced the expression levels of the LCT1 and HMA2 genes involved in Cd accumulation and transport in wheat roots by 46% and 30%, respectively, compared to the controls. In the Cd-contaminated soils, strain WRS8 significantly reduced the available Cd content by 20-24% and increased the pH compared to the controls. These findings showed the important role of strain WRS8 in reducing solution and soil Cd availability and suggested that strain WRS8 reduced the wheat tissue Cd accumulation by increasing root surface Cd adsorption and decreasing wheat root Cd uptake and transport-related gene expression and may provide a new and effective wheat rhizobacteria-enhanced approach for reducing wheat Cd uptake in Cd-polluted environments."

However, comprehensive identification and analysis of the NPR1 -like gene family had not been conducted so far in bread wheat and its relatives. Here, a total of 17 NPR genes in Triticum aestivum , five NPR genes in Triticum urartu , 12 NPR genes in Triticum dicoccoides , and six NPR genes in Aegilops tauschii were identified using bioinformatics approaches. Protein properties of these putative NPR1 -like genes were also described. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 40 NPR1-like proteins, together with 40 NPR1-related proteins from other plant species, were clustered into three major clades. The TaNPR1 -like genes belonging to the same Arabidopsis subfamilies shared similar exon-intron patterns and protein domain compositions, as well as conserved motifs and amino acid residues. The cis-regulatory elements related to SA were identified in the promoter regions of TaNPR1 -like genes. The TaNPR1 -like genes were intensively mapped on the chromosomes of homoeologous groups 3, 4, and 5, except TaNPR2-D . Chromosomal distribution and collinearity analysis of NPR1 -like genes among bread wheat and its relatives revealed that the evolution of this gene family was more conservative following formation of hexaploid wheat. Transcriptome data analysis indicated that TaNPR1 -like genes exhibited tissue/organ-specific expression patterns and some members were induced under biotic stress. These findings lay the foundation for further functional characterization of NPR1-like proteins in bread wheat and its relatives."

Recently, more and more researches on JAZ gene family are reported in many plants. Although the genome sequencing of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its relatives is complete, our knowledge about this gene family remains vacant."
"28193162","abstracttext_results","Fourteen JAZ genes were identified in the wheat genome. Structural analysis revealed that the TaJAZ proteins in wheat were as conserved as those in other plants, but had structural characteristics. By phylogenetic analysis, all JAZ proteins from wheat and other plants were clustered into 11 sub-groups (G1-G11), and TaJAZ proteins shared a high degree of similarity with some JAZ proteins from Aegliops tauschii, Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa. The Ka/Ks ratios of TaJAZ genes ranged from 0.0016 to 0.6973, suggesting that the TaJAZ family had undergone purifying selection in wheat. Gene expression patterns obtained by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) revealed differential temporal and spatial regulation of TaJAZ genes under multifarious abiotic stress treatments of high salinity, drought, cold and phytohormone. Among these, TaJAZ7, 8 and 12 were specifically expressed in the anther tissues of the thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) wheat line BS366 and normal control wheat line Jing411. Compared with the gene expression patterns in the normal wheat line Jing411, TaJAZ7, 8 and 12 had different expression patterns in abnormally dehiscent anthers of BS366 at the heading stage 6, suggesting that specific up- or down-regulation of these genes might be associated with the abnormal anther dehiscence in TGMS wheat line."

In conclusion, the results of this study contributed some novel and detailed information about JAZ gene family in wheat, and also provided 3 potential candidate genes for improving the TGMS wheat line."

About 97% of the composite sequence of A-gliadin (an alpha-type gliadin fraction) has also been obtained by direct amino acid sequencing. This sequence shows a high degree of similarity with amino acid sequences derived from both cDNA clones and is virtually identical to one of them. On the basis of sequence information, after loss of the signal sequence, the mature alpha-type gliadins may be divided into five different domains, two of which may have evolved from an ancestral gliadin gene, whereas the remaining three contain repeating sequences that may have developed independently."

"15569704","abstracttext","Plants co-ordinate information derived from many diverse external and internal signals to ensure appropriate control of gene expression under optimal and stress conditions. In this work, the relationships between catalase (CAT) and H2O2 during drought in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are studied. Drought-induced H2O2 accumulation correlated with decreases in soil water content and CO2 assimilation. Leaf H2O2 content increased even though total CAT activity doubled under severe drought conditions. Diurnal regulation of CAT1 and CAT2 mRNA abundance was apparent in all conditions and day/night CAT1 and CAT2 expression patterns were modified by mild and severe drought. The abundance of CAT1 transcripts was regulated by circadian controls that persisted in continuous darkness, while CAT2 was modulated by light. Drought decreased abundance, and modified the pattern, of CAT1 and CAT2 mRNAs. It was concluded that the complex regulation of CAT mRNA, particularly at the level of translation, allows precise control of leaf H2O2 accumulation."

We describe here the TaPdxK gene which encodes a pyridoxal kinase, cloned from Triticum aestivum by RACE PCR method. The putative amino acid sequence of TaPdxK is 78% identical to Arabidopsis AtSOS4. Southern analysis suggests that there are at least two copies of pyridoxal kinase genes in wheat genome. The expression of TaPdxK cDNAs complements an Escherichia coli mutant defective in pyridoxal kinase. TaPdxK transcripts were detected in roots, shoots, spikes and anthers by RT-PCR analysis.

However, this decrease was more modest in Dongnongdongmai 1, which had a higher sugar content. Sucrose and fructose were the main soluble sugars, indicating an important role in freezing tolerance. Gene expression studies revealed that expression of the genes encoding chloroplastic enzymes was significantly upregulated in the tillering nodes. Expression upregulation of TaSS and TaTPT may be helpful for sugar accumulation before November 4."

Highest values of seedling length and vigour were recorded with Methylobacterium sp. (NC28). HPLC analysis of production by bacterial strains ranged from 1.09 to 9.89 μg ml(-1) of cytokinins in the culture filtrate. Such cytokinin producing beneficial methylotrophs can be useful in developing bio-inoculants through co-inoculation of pink-pigmented facultative methylotrophs with other compatible bacterial strains, for improving plant growth and productivity, in an environment-friendly manner."

The ACC activity per chloroplast also showed little variation between species of different ploidy but since chloroplast number increases with ploidy, the ACC activities and ACC amounts per cell also increased with ploidy. These cellular increases in ACC amounts associated with increases in gene dosage were highly co-ordinated in the diploids T. monococcum and T. tauschii and their respective autotetraploids so the specific activity of ACC was highly conserved in these plants. The relevance of these findings to attempts to genetically manipulate lipid biosynthesis in chloroplasts is discussed."

Two cytoplasmic patterns are found: one for the euplasmic lines with Triticum aestivum cytoplasm and one for the alloplasmic lines with Aegilops juvenalis, Ae. ventricosa and Ae. kotschyi cytoplasms. Cytoplasmic variation is observed for 28 spots showing position difference, all of which are probably products of the LS gene, and for four spots showing differences for regulation of protein quantity. Nuclear variation between 'Chinese Spring' and 'Selkirk' is found for 20 allelic differences and for 20 regulatory systems, the latter number being probably underestimated."
"24232803","articletitle","The characterization and comparative analysis of high-molecular-weight glutenin genes from genomes A and B of a hexaploid bread wheat."
"24232803","abstracttext","Two high-molecular-weight subunit (HMWS) glutenin genes from the A and B genomes of the hexaploid bread wheat Triticum aestivum L. cv Cheyenne have been isolated and sequenced. Both of these genes are of the high Mr class (x-type) of HMW glutenins, and have not been previously reported. The entire set of six HMW genes from cultivar Cheyenne have now been isolated and characterized. An analysis of the Ax and Bx sequences shows that the Ax sequence is similar to the homoeologous gene from the D genome, while the Bx repeat structure is significantly different. The repetitive region of these proteins can be modelled as a series of interspersed copies of repeat modifs of 6, 9, and 15 amino acid residues. The evolution of these genes includes single-base substitutions over the entire coding region, plus insertion/deletions of single or blocks of repeats in the central repetitive domain."

"31571228","abstracttext","The cereal crops rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) provide half of the food eaten by humankind. However, understanding their biology has proved challenging due to their large size, long lifecycle and large genomes. The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana avoids these practical problems and has provided fundamental understanding of plant biology, however not all of this knowledge is directly transferrable to cereals. Recent developments in gene editing, speed breeding and genome assembly techniques mean that the challenges associated with working with the major cereal crops can be overcome. Resources such as mutant collections and genome sequences are now available for these crops, making them attractive experimental systems with which to make discoveries that are directly applicable to increasing crop production."

"32529987","abstracttext","Powdery mildew ( Blumeria graminis f. sp. Tritici , ( Bgt )) is an important worldwide fungal foliar disease of wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) responsible for severe yield losses. The development of resistance genes and dissection of the resistance mechanism will therefore be beneficial in wheat breeding. The Bgt resistance gene PmAS846 was transferred to the hexaploid wheat lines N9134 from Triticum dicoccoides, and it is still one of the most effective resistance genes. Here, by RNA sequencing, we identified three co-expressed gene modules using pairwise comparisons and weighted gene co-expression network analysis during wheat-Bgt interactions compared with mock-infected plants. Hub genes of stress-specific modules were significantly enriched in spliceosomes, phagosomes, the mRNA surveillance pathway, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and endocytosis. Induced module genes located on chromosome 5BL were selected to construct a protein-protein interaction network. Several proteins were predicted as the key hub node, including Hsp70, DEAD/DEAH box RNA helicase PRH75, elongation factor EF-2, cell division cycle 5, ARF guanine-nucleotide exchange factor GNOM-like, and protein phosphatase 2C 70 protein, which interacted with several disease resistance proteins such as RLP37, RPP13 and RPS2 analogues. Gene ontology enrichment results showed that wheat could activate binding functional genes via an mRNA transcription mechanism in response to Bgt stress. Of these node genes, GNOM-like, PP2C isoform X1 and transmembrane 9 superfamily member 9 were mapped onto the genetic fragment of PmAS846 with a distance of 4.8 Mb. This work provides the foundations for understanding the resistance mechanism and cloning the resistance gene PmAS846 ."

"23660284","abstracttext","The functional annotation of genes based on sequence homology with genes from model species genomes is time-consuming because it is necessary to mine several unrelated databases. The aim of the present work was to develop a functional annotation database for common wheat Triticum aestivum (L.). The database, named dbWFA, is based on the reference NCBI UniGene set, an expressed gene catalogue built by expressed sequence tag clustering, and on full-length coding sequences retrieved from the TriFLDB database. Information from good-quality heterogeneous sources, including annotations for model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. and Oryza sativa L., was gathered and linked to T. aestivum sequences through BLAST-based homology searches. Even though the complexity of the transcriptome cannot yet be fully appreciated, we developed a tool to easily and promptly obtain information from multiple functional annotation systems (Gene Ontology, MapMan bin codes, MIPS Functional Categories, PlantCyc pathway reactions and TAIR gene families). The use of dbWFA is illustrated here with several query examples. We were able to assign a putative function to 45% of the UniGenes and 81% of the full-length coding sequences from TriFLDB. Moreover, comparison of the annotation of the whole T. aestivum UniGene set along with curated annotations of the two model species assessed the accuracy of the annotation provided by dbWFA. To further illustrate the use of dbWFA, genes specifically expressed during the early cell division or late storage polymer accumulation phases of T. aestivum grain development were identified using a clustering analysis and then annotated using dbWFA. The annotation of these two sets of genes was consistent with previous analyses of T. aestivum grain transcriptomes and proteomes. Database URL: urgi.versailles.inra.fr/dbWFA/"
"14557548","articletitle","MADS box genes control vernalization-induced flowering in cereals."
"14557548","abstracttext","By comparing expression levels of MADS box transcription factor genes between near-isogenic winter and spring lines of bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, we have identified WAP1 as the probable candidate for the Vrn-1 gene, the major locus controlling the vernalization flowering response in wheat. WAP1 is strongly expressed in spring wheats and moderately expressed in semispring wheats, but is not expressed in winter wheat plants that have not been exposed to vernalization treatment. Vernalization promotes flowering in winter wheats and strongly induces expression of WAP1. WAP1 is located on chromosome 5 in wheat and, by synteny with other cereal genomes, is likely to be collocated with Vrn-1. These results in hexaploid bread wheat cultivars extend the conclusion made by Yan et al. [Yan, L., Loukoianov, A., Tranquilli, G., Helguera, M., Fahima, T. & Dubcovsky, J. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 100, 6263-6268] in the diploid wheat progenitor Triticum monococcum that WAP1 (TmAP1) corresponds to the Vrn-1 gene. The barley homologue of WAP1, BM5, shows a similar pattern of expression to WAP1 and TmAP1. BM5 is not expressed in winter barleys that have not been vernalized, but as with WAP1, expression of BM5 is strongly induced by vernalization treatment. In spring barleys, the level of BM5 expression is determined by interactions between the Vrn-H1 locus and a second locus for spring habit, Vrn-H2. There is now evidence that AP1-like genes determine the time of flowering in a range of cereal and grass species."
"25074914","articletitle","Evolution of physiological responses to salt stress in hexaploid wheat."
"25074914","abstracttext","Hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., genome BBAADD) is generally more salt tolerant than its tetraploid wheat progenitor (Triticum turgidum L.). However, little is known about the physiological basis of this trait or about the relative contributions of allohexaploidization and subsequent evolutionary genetic changes on the trait development. Here, we compared the salt tolerance of a synthetic allohexaploid wheat (neo-6x) with its tetraploid (T. turgidum; BBAA) and diploid (Aegilops tauschii; DD) parents, as well as a natural hexaploid bread wheat (nat-6x). We studied 92 morphophysiological traits and analyzed homeologous gene expression of a major salt-tolerance gene High-Affinity K(+) Transporter 1;5 (HKT1;5). We observed that under salt stress, neo-6x exhibited higher fitness than both of its parental genotypes due to inheritance of favorable traits like higher germination rate from the 4x parent and the stronger root Na(+) retention capacity from the 2x parent. Moreover, expression of the D-subgenome HKT1;5 homeolog, which is responsible for Na(+) removal from the xylem vessels, showed an immediate transcriptional reprogramming following allohexaploidization, i.e., from constitutive high basal expression in Ae. tauschii (2x) to salt-induced expression in neo-6x. This phenomenon was also witnessed in the nat-6x. An integrated analysis of 92 traits showed that, under salt-stress conditions, neo-6x resembled more closely the 2x than the 4x parent, suggesting that the salt stress induces enhanced expressivity of the D-subgenome homeologs in the synthetic hexaploid wheat. Collectively, the results suggest that condition-dependent functionalization of the subgenomes might have contributed to the wide-ranging adaptability of natural hexaploid wheat."
"29707435","articletitle","Genome comparison implies the role of Wsm2 in membrane trafficking and protein degradation."
"29707435","abstracttext","Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) causes streak mosaic disease in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and has been an important constraint limiting wheat production in many regions around the world. Wsm2 is the only resistance gene discovered in wheat genome and has been located in a short genomic region of its chromosome 3B. However, the sequence nature and the biological function of Wsm2 remain unknown due to the difficulty of genetic manipulation in wheat. In this study, we tested WSMV infectivity among wheat and its two closely related grass species, rice ( Oryza sativa ) and Brachypodium distachyon . Based on the phenotypic result and previous genomic studies, we developed a novel bioinformatics pipeline for interpreting a potential biological function of Wsm2 and its ancestor locus in wheat. In the WSMV resistance tests, we found that rice has a WMSV resistance gene while Brachypodium does not, which allowed us to hypothesize the presence of a Wsm2 ortholog in rice. Our OrthoMCL analysis of protein coding genes on wheat chromosome 3B and its syntenic chromosomes in rice and Brachypodium discovered 4,035 OrthoMCL groups as preliminary candidates of Wsm2 orthologs. Given that Wsm2 is likely duplicated through an intrachromosomal illegitimate recombination and that Wsm2 is dominant, we inferred that this new WSMV-resistance gene acquired an activation domain, lost an inhibition domain, or gained high expression compared to its ancestor locus. Through comparison, we identified that 67, 16, and 10 out of 4,035 OrthoMCL orthologous groups contain a rice member with 25% shorter or longer in length, or 10 fold more expression, respectively, than those from wheat and Brachypodium. Taken together, we predicted a total of 93 good candidates for a Wsm2 ancestor locus. All of these 93 candidates are not tightly linked with Wsm2 , indicative of the role of illegitimate recombination in the birth of Wsm2 . Further sequence analysis suggests that the protein products of Wsm2 may combat WSMV disease through a molecular mechanism involving protein degradation and/or membrane trafficking. The 93 putative Wsm2 ancestor loci discovered in this study could serve as good candidates for future genetic isolation of the true Wsm2 locus."

"29164313","abstracttext_key message","Here, we show that Au SINE elements have strong associations with protein-coding genes in wheat. Most importantly Au SINE insertion within introns causes allelic variation and might induce intron retention. The impact of transposable elements (TEs) on genome structure and function is intensively studied in eukaryotes, especially in plants where TEs can reach up to 90% of the genome in some cases, such as in wheat. Here, we have performed a genome-wide in-silico analysis using the updated publicly available genome draft of bread wheat (T. aestivum), in addition to the updated genome drafts of the diploid donor species, T. urartu and Ae. tauschii, to retrieve and analyze a non-LTR retrotransposon family, termed Au SINE, which was found to be widespread in plant species. Then, we have performed site-specific PCR and realtime RT-PCR analyses to assess the possible impact of Au SINE on gene structure and function. To this end, we retrieved 133, 180 and 1886 intact Au SINE insertions from T. urartu, Ae. tauschii and T. aestivum genome drafts, respectively. The 1886 Au SINE insertions were distributed in the seven homoeologous chromosomes of T. aestivum, while ~ 67% of the insertions were associated with genes. Detailed analysis of 40 genes harboring Au SINE revealed allelic variation of those genes in the Triticum-Aegilops genus. In addition, expression analysis revealed that both regular transcripts and alternative Au SINE-containing transcripts were simultaneously amplified in the same tissue, indicating retention of Au SINE-containing introns. Analysis of the wheat transcriptome revealed that hundreds of protein-coding genes harbor Au SINE in at least one of their mature splice variants. Au SINE might play a prominent role in speciation by creating transcriptome variation."

"9404544","abstracttext","Direct uptake of reporter gene constructs with the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene fused to various promoters was achieved to embryogenic cell suspension culture-derived protoplasts of GK Ságvári winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment. Based on GUS specific activity values, it was found that Mg2+ with PEG at 20% final concentration can significantly increase the transient expression in wheat protoplasts in comparison to the Ca(2+)-containing medium. The optimum incubation time in transformation mixture was 5-10 min at 25 degrees C. Transient GUS expression as detected by spectrofluorimetry was positively correlated with the time elapsed after DNA uptake (with maximum activity at 48 h), and the incubation time in GUS reaction mixture. It was also found that the protoplast culture medium plays an important role in the efficiency, and the treated wheat protoplasts cultured in KM medium showed a higher GUS activity than those kept in GM medium. Among the five plasmid constructs 6-16-fold higher promoter activity has been achieved with pKM794 driven by CaMV 35S promoter plus two enhancer elements than with the other constructs tested."

"10902712","abstracttext","A 2.2-kb nucleotide sequence rich in AT, located upstream from the Bx7 allele of the high-molecular-weight glutenin Glu-B1 locus in wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Glenlea) was cloned following amplification by PCR. The 5' region of this sequence contains motifs typically found in matrix attachment regions (MARs) in other plants. We have shown that part of the 2.2-kb DNA binds to wheat nuclear matrix (NM) in vitro, at least as strongly as a known MAR (Adh1) from maize suggesting that there is a MAR upstream of Bx7. This MAR is approximately 800 bases in length running from -750 to -1560 bases, relative to the start codon. Although the MAR is associated with a tissue-specific gene and is beside a strong tissue-specific promoter, the MAR sequence did not lead to tissue-specific expression of the beta-glucuronidase marker gene under the control of the rice actin promoter in various tissues. Presence of the MAR was only slightly beneficial with respect to expression levels, which were not greatly altered in transient expression assays in various wheat tissues although a slight increase in the number of foci was observed in leaves, which have low transformation efficiencies."

"11016840","abstracttext","Uncoupling proteins (UCP) found in the inner mitochondrial membrane of mammals dissipate the proton electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane to produce heat rather than synthesize ATP. Using PCR-based methods, we isolated two novel cDNA clones, WhUCP1a and WhUCP1b, that encode the mitochondrial uncoupling protein of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The cDNA clones each contain one ORF which can code for a protein of 286 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of about 30.5 kDa, although three amino acid substitutions are found between them. The deduced amino acid sequences each possess three typical mitochondrial carrier signature domains and six membrane-spanning domains which are highly conserved in the mitochondrial transporter family. Southern analysis suggested that the WhUCP1 gene may be present in as many as three copies in the wheat genome, and also that WhUCP proteins may be encoded by a small multigene family. Northern analysis revealed that the steady-state level of the WhUCP1 mRNA is quite low. Quantitative RT-PCR clearly showed that expression of the WhUCP1 gene in wheat seedlings is insensitive to low temperature. Our data suggest that WhUCP1 might have functions other than low temperature-induced thermogenesis, although WhUCP1 possesses all the typical features reported for known UCPs."

"12671750","abstracttext","During the past decade Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe has resulted in severe grain yield and quality losses of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Northern Great Plains of the U.S. Given the complexity of breeding for FHB resistance, molecular markers associated with this trait will be valuable in accelerating efforts to breed resistant cultivars. The objective of this study was to identify molecular markers linked to quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FHB resistance in wheat using a set of lines obtained by several cycles of crossing to North Dakota adapted genotypes, which derived their resistance from cv. Sumai 3. Microsatellite markers spanning the wheat genome were used to screen parents and derived lines. Polymorphisms for parental alleles were compared to disease scores for Type II resistance. The probability of linkage between markers and introgressed resistance genes was calculated using a binomial probability formula based on the assumption that a molecular marker at a specific distance from the introgressed gene, in a near-isogenic line (NIL), will carry the donor-parent allele as a function of the distance between marker and gene and the number of backcrosses/selfs performed in deriving the NIL. Microsatellite loci Xgwm533 and Xgwm274 were significantly associated with QTL for FHB resistance."

The fungus can also cause disease on Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, the disease-causing ability of two F. graminearum mutants was analysed to further explore the parallels between the wheat (Triticum aestivum) and Arabidopsis floral pathosystems. Wild-type F. graminearum (strain PH-1) and two isogenic transformants lacking either the mitogen-activated protein kinase MAP1 gene or the trichodiene synthase TRI5 gene were individually spray- or point-inoculated onto Arabidopsis and wheat floral tissue. Disease development was quantitatively assessed both macroscopically and microscopically and deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin concentrations determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Wild-type strain inoculations caused high levels of disease in both plant species and significant DON production. The map1 mutant caused minimal disease and DON accumulation in both hosts. The tri5 mutant, which is unable to produce DON, exhibited reduced pathogenicity on wheat ears, causing only discrete eye-shaped lesions on spikelets which failed to infect the rachis. By contrast, the tri5 mutant retained full pathogenicity on Arabidopsis floral tissue. This study reveals that DON mycotoxin production is not required for F. graminearum to colonize Arabidopsis floral tissue."

The F2 population segregated in a 15:1 ratio for fertility/sterility in 243 individuals under long day-length/high-temperature. The two thermophotoperiod-responsive male sterile genes were mapped to chromosomes 5B and 2B using Simple Sequence Repeat (SSR) markers and bulked segregant analysis. Partial linkage maps around the sterility loci of chromosomes 2B and 5B were constructed using the 243 individuals in the F2 population. One gene (wptms1) for male sterility was flanked by the SSR markers Xgwm335 and Xgwm371 at a genetic distance in chromosome 5B of 4.1 and 24.4 cM, respectively. The second gene (wptms2) was mapped between markers Xgwm374 and Xgwm120 at a genetic distance of 6.6 and 20.9 cM, respectively. The closest linked markers Xgwm335 (wptms1) and Xgwm374 (wptms2) explained 53 and 38% of phenotypic variation for the fertility.

"18411273","abstracttext","Cadmium causes the generation of reactive oxygen species, which in turn causes cell damage. We isolated a novel gene from a wheat root cDNA library, which conferred Cd(II)-specific tolerance when expressed in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The gene, which we called TaTM20, for Triticum aestivum transmembrane 20, encodes a putative hydrophobic polypeptide of 889 amino acids, containing 20 transmembrane domains arranged as a 5-fold internal repeating unit of 4 transmembrane domains each. Expression of TaTM20 in yeast cells stimulated Cd(II) efflux resulting in a decrease in the content of yeast intracellular cadmium. TaTM20-induced Cd(II) tolerance was maintained in yeast even under conditions of reduced GSH. These results demonstrate that TaTM20 enhances Cd(II) tolerance in yeast through the stimulation of Cd(II) efflux from the cell, partially independent of GSH. Treatment of wheat seedlings with Cd(II) induced their expression of TaTM20, decreasing subsequent root Cd(II) accumulation and suggesting a possible role for TaTM20 in Cd(II) tolerance in wheat."

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that four MYB genes were consistently up-regulated in the seedling roots of both genotypes under short-term salt treatment. Three MYB genes were found to be up-regulated in both genotypes under long-term salt stress. One MYB gene was up-regulated in both genotypes under both short- and long-term salt stress. Of these salt up-regulated MYB genes, one MYB gene (TaMYBsdu1) was markedly up-regulated in the leaf and root of wheat under long-term drought stress. In addition, TaMYBsdu1 showed higher expression levels in the salt-tolerant genotype than in the susceptible genotype under salt stress. These data suggest that TaMYBsdu1 is a potentially important regulator involved in wheat adaptation to both salt and drought stresses."

Quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed that the transcription of TaGlu was induced during both compatible and incompatible interactions with Pst, but the transcription level was much higher in the incompatible interaction than that in the compatible interaction. TaGlu also showed noticeable induction of gene expression in young green leaf tissues treated with salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate or ethylene. Immunogold labeling assays showed that the enzyme were localized mainly in the host cell wall and over the extra haustorial matrix, and the labeling densities were found significantly higher in the incompatible interaction than those in the compatible interaction."

Six to ten thousand gene sequences were sampled per chromosome. These were classified into genes that have their closest homologs in the Triticeae group 1 syntenic region in Brachypodium, rice (Oryza sativa), and/or sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and genes that have their homologs elsewhere in these model grass genomes. Although the number of syntenic genes was similar between the homologous groups, the amount of nonsyntenic genes was found to be extremely diverse between wheat and barley and even between wheat subgenomes. Besides a small core group of genes that are nonsyntenic in other grasses but conserved among Triticeae, we found thousands of genic sequences that are specific to chromosomes of one single species or subgenome. By examining in detail 50 genes from chromosome 1H for which BAC sequences were available, we found that many represent pseudogenes that resulted from transposable element activity and double-strand break repair. Thus, Triticeae seem to accumulate nonsyntenic genes frequently. Since many of them are likely to be pseudogenes, total gene numbers in Triticeae are prone to pronounced overestimates."

Despite this, expressed sequence tags are an important resource that permits opportunities for large scale gene identification. In this study, a total of 218 sequences from wheat were identified and confirmed to be putative MYB proteins, including 1RMYB, R2R3-type MYB, 3RMYB, and 4RMYB types. A total of 36 R2R3-type MYB genes with complete open reading frames were obtained. The putative orthologs were assigned in rice and Arabidopsis based on the phylogenetic tree. Tissue-specific expression pattern analyses confirmed the predicted orthologs, and this meant that gene information could be inferred from the Arabidopsis genes. Moreover, the motifs flanking the MYB domain were analyzed using the MEME web server. The distribution of motifs among wheat MYB proteins was investigated and this facilitated subfamily classification."

"23232769","abstracttext","The quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) for making bread is largely due to the strength and extensibility of wheat dough, which in turn is due to the properties of polymeric glutenin. Polymeric glutenin consists of high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin protein subunits linked by disulphide bonds between cysteine residues. Glutenin subunits differ in their effects on dough mixing properties. The research presented here investigated the effect of a specific, recently discovered, glutenin subunit on dough mixing properties. This subunit, Bx7.1, is unusual in that it has a cysteine in its repetitive domain. With site-directed mutagenesis of the gene encoding Bx7.1, a guanine in the repetitive domain was replaced by an adenine, to provide a mutant gene encoding a subunit (MutBx7.1) in which the repetitive-domain cysteine was replaced by a tyrosine residue. Bx7.1, MutBx7.1 and other Bx-type glutenin subunits were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. This made it possible to incorporate each individual subunit into wheat flour and evaluate the effect of the cysteine residue on dough properties. The Bx7.1 subunit affected dough mixing properties differently from the other subunits. These differences are due to the extra cysteine residue, which may interfere with glutenin polymerisation through cross-linkage within the Bx7.1 subunit, causing this subunit to act as a chain terminator."

The open reading frame of TaISA3 was found to have 2331 bp, and its deduced amino acid sequence was found to share high similarity with those of other gramineous plant ISA3 proteins. It contains a putative transit peptide (68 amino acids), N-terminus domain (107 amino acids), and a catalytic domain (173 amino acids). We extracted the expressed TaISA3 protein from Escherichia coli (BL21), and measured starch isoamylase activity. During the wheat grain-filling period, transcripts of the TaISA3 gene reached a maximum level at the early developmental stage, then declined, and increased again near the final maturation stage of the grain. We confirm that the ISA3 gene is present in common wheat; it appears to play a role in starch synthesis during early and late stages of the grain-filling period."

"24202741","abstracttext","We have used the polymerase chain reaction to analyse variation in the size of individual 5S-ribosomal gene spacer sequences. This reaction can be used to demonstrate inter- and intraspecific variation in spacer size, and combined with DNA sequencing it may thus be a valuable taxonomic tool. Two sets of nested polymerase chain reaction primers were designed to amplify the nontranscribed spacer DNA between repeated 5S-rRNA genes. These ""universal"" primers were used to generate fragments from the genomic DNA from several unrelated monocotyledonous plants. Ribosomal RNA spacer sequences generated in these experiments could also be used to locate 5S-rRNA gene clusters on specific chromosomes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). Three distinct spacer sizes were observed after amplification. These were assigned locations on chromosomes by analysing amplification products of genomic DNA from nullisomic/tetrasomic and ditelosomic wheat stocks. ""Large"" 508-bp 5S repeats are located on the short arm of chromosome 5B and ""short"" 416-bp and 425-bp repeat unit variants are located on the short arms of chromosomes 1B and 1D, respectively. No other loci were detected. The spacer fragments were cloned, sequenced, and shown to be homologous to wheat 5S-rRNA spacers previously identified. Spacers of uniform size but with some sequence heterogeneity were shown to be located at each locus."

"25670745","abstracttext","Broad phenotypic variations were induced in derivatives of an asymmetric somatic hybridization of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum Podp); however, how these variations occurred was unknown. We explored the nature of these variations by cytogenetic assays and DNA profiling techniques to characterize six genetically stable somatic introgression lines. Karyotyping results show the six lines similar to their wheat parent, but GISH analysis identified the presence of a number of short introgressed tall wheatgrass chromatin segments. DNA profiling revealed many genetic and epigenetic differences, including sequences deletions, altered regulation of gene expression, changed patterns of cytosine methylation, and the reactivation of retrotransposons. Phenotypic variations appear to result from altered repetitive sequences combined with the epigenetic regulation of gene expression and/or retrotransposon transposition. The extent of genetic and epigenetic variation due to the maintenance of parent wheat cells in tissue culture was assessed and shown to be considerably lower than had been induced in the introgression lines. Asymmetric somatic hybridization provides appropriate material to explore the nature of the genetic and epigenetic variations induced by genomic shock."
"26092364","articletitle","The involvement of expansins in response to water stress during leaf development in wheat."
"26092364","abstracttext","Expansins are cell wall proteins that are generally considered to be the key regulator of cell wall extension during plant growth. In this study, we used two different wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to demonstrate that expansins are involved in wheat leaf growth and response to water stress, by regulating the expansin activity and cell wall susceptibility to expansins. Expansin activity was associated with the relative elongation rate of leaves during leaf development, suggesting their involvement in leaf elongation. Moreover, cell wall extension characteristics and expansin gene transcription were closely involved in the leaf cell elongation region. Water stress restrains leaf growth, but the growth rate of leaves was changed after rehydration, which is consistent with the response of expansin activity to water stress. Meanwhile, increased cell wall susceptibility to expansin by water deficit played an important role in maintaining cell wall extension. Furthermore, the expansin activity in drought-resistant cultivar HF9703 was always higher than that in drought-sensitive cultivar 921842 under water stress condition, which may be correlated with the higher expansin gene expression in HF9703 versus 921842. These data provide evidence for a role of expansins in the growth and response of wheat leaves to water stress."

"29410526","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) quality is mainly determined by grain storage protein compositions. Sulphur availability is essential for the biosynthesis of the main wheat storage proteins. In this study, the impact of different sulphur fertilizer regimes on a range of agronomically important traits and associated gene networks was studied. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse the protein compositions of grains grown under four different sulphur treatments. Results revealed that sulphur supplementation had a significant effect on grain yield, harvest index, and storage protein compositions. Consequently, two comparative sulphur fertilizer treatments (0 and 30 kg ha -1 sulphur, with 50 kg ha -1 nitrogen) at seven days post-anthesis were selected for a transcriptomics analysis to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the regulation of sulphur metabolic pathways. The International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium chromosome survey sequence was used as reference. Higher sulphur supply led to one up-regulated DEG and sixty-three down-regulated DEGs. Gene ontology enrichment showed that four down-regulated DEGs were significantly enriched in nitrogen metabolic pathway related annotation, three of which were annotated as glutamine synthetase. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment identified three significantly enriched pathways involved in nitrogen and amino acid metabolism."

"29710831","abstracttext","Tiller number is an important agronomic trait for grain yield of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). A dwarf-monoculm wheat mutant ( dmc ) was obtained from cultivar Guomai 301 (wild type, WT). Here, we explored the molecular basis for the restrained tiller development of the mutant dmc . Two bulked samples of the mutant dmc (T1, T2 and T3) and WT (T4, T5 and T6) with three biological replicates were comparatively analyzed at the transcriptional level by bulked RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). In total, 68.8 Gb data and 463 million reads were generated, 80% of which were mapped to the wheat reference genome of Chinese Spring. A total of 4904 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between the mutant dmc and WT. DEGs and their related major biological functions were characterized based on GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) categories. These results were confirmed by quantitatively analyzing the expression profiles of twelve selected DEGs via real-time qRT-PCR. The down-regulated gene expressions related to phytohormone syntheses of auxin, zeatin, cytokinin and some transcription factor (TF) families of TALE, and WOX might be the major causes of the mutant dmc, not tillering.

"30875373","abstracttext","Salt stress is one of the major adverse environmental factors limiting crop productivity. Considering Iran as one of the bread wheat origins, we sequenced root transcriptome of an Iranian salt tolerant cultivar, Arg, under salt stress to extend our knowledge of the molecular basis of salinity tolerance in Triticum aestivum. RNA sequencing resulted in more than 113 million reads and about 104013 genes were obtained, among which 26171 novel transcripts were identified. A comparison of abundances showed that 5128 genes were differentially expressed due to salt stress. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated with Gene Ontology terms, and the key pathways were identified using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) pathway mapping. The DEGs could be classified into 227 KEGG pathways among which transporters, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, transcription factors, glycosyltransferases, glutathione metabolism and plant hormone signal transduction represented the most significant pathways. Furthermore, the expression pattern of nine genes involved in salt stress response was compared between the salt tolerant (Arg) and susceptible (Moghan3) cultivars. A panel of novel genes and transcripts is found in this research to be differentially expressed under salinity in Arg cultivar and a model is proposed for salt stress response in this salt tolerant cultivar of wheat employing the DEGs. The achieved results can be beneficial for better understanding and improvement of salt tolerance in wheat."
"32211007","articletitle","The Resurgence of Introgression Breeding, as Exemplified in Wheat Improvement."
"32211007","abstracttext","Breeding progress in most crops has relied heavily on the exploitation of variation within the species' primary gene pool, a process which is destined to fail once the supply of novel variants has been exhausted. Accessing a crop's secondary gene pool, as represented by its wild relatives, has the potential to greatly expand the supply of usable genetic variation. The crop in which this approach has been most strongly championed is bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), a species which is particularly tolerant of the introduction of chromosomal segments of exotic origin thanks to the genetic buffering afforded by its polyploid status. While the process of introgression can be in itself cumbersome, a larger problem is that linkage drag and/or imperfect complementation frequently impose a yield and/or quality penalty, which explains the reluctance of breeders to introduce such materials into their breeding populations. Thanks to the development of novel strategies to induce introgression and of genomic tools to facilitate the selection of desirable genotypes, introgression breeding is returning as a mainstream activity, at least in wheat. Accessing variation present in progenitor species has even been able to drive genetic advance in grain yield. The current resurgence of interest in introgression breeding can be expected to result in an increased deployment of exotic genes in commercial wheat cultivars."

"30256420","abstracttext","DNA methylation is dynamically involved in plant immunity, but little information is known about its roles in plant interactions with biotrophic fungi, especially in temperate grasses such as wheat (Triticum aestivum). Using wheat diploid progenitor Aegilops tauschii accession AL8/78, the genome of which has been sequenced, we assessed the extent of DNA methylation in response to infection with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), which causes powdery mildew. Upon Bgt infection, ARGONAUTE4a (AGO4a) was significantly downregulated in A. tauschii, which was accompanied by a substantial reduction in AGO4a-sorted 24-nt siRNA levels, especially for genes near transposable elements (TAGs). Bisulfite sequencing revealed abundant differentially methylated regions (DMRs) with CHH hypomethylation. TAGs bearing CHH-hypomethylated DMRs were enriched for 'response to stress' functions, including receptor kinase, peroxidase, and pathogenesis-related genes. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of a DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLASE 2 (DRM2) homolog enhanced plant resistance to Bgt. The effect of CHH hypomethylation was exemplified by the upregulation of a pathogenesis-related β-1,3-glucanse gene implicated in Bgt defense. These findings support the idea that dynamic DNA methylation represents a regulatory layer in the complex mechanism of plant immunity, which could be exploited to improve disease resistance in common wheat."

"30845616","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in China. Sixty-one spring and 102 facultative or winter growth habit wheat cultivars from China and a set of testers, carrying named Lr genes, were evaluated for resistance at the seedling growth stage with an array of Mexican Puccinia triticina races. Variation in seedling infection types of the cultivars was compared with that of the testers, and genes conferring low infection types were postulated. In total, nine named genes, Lr1 (in 13 cultivars), Lr3 (12), Lr3bg (2), Lr10 (1), Lr13 (4), Lr14a (1), Lr16 (49), Lr23 (9), and Lr26 (81), were identified. Thirty-one cultivars displayed intermediate reactions to one or more races that could not be attributed to any named gene. Twenty-eight spring cultivars were also evaluated at two field sites in Mexico using two common races. About half of them displayed good to moderate adult resistance that may be partly due to the presence of slow rusting gene Lr34 in at least seven cultivars. Diversity in adult plant responses of these wheats indicated the presence of additional slow rusting genes. Presence of 1B.1R translocation in 12 wheat cultivars, supposedly derived from intergeneric crosses involving T. durum, Haynaldia villosa, and Avena fatua, indicated that their pedigrees were incorrect."

To study the mechanism underlying the defense of wheat to Pst , we used the next-generation sequencing and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technologies to generate transcriptomic and proteomic profiles of seedling leaves at different stages under conditions of pathogen stress. By conducting comparative proteomic analysis using iTRAQ, we identified 2050, 2190, and 2258 differentially accumulated protein species at 24, 48, and 72 h post-inoculation (hpi). Using pairwise comparisons and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) of the transcriptome, we identified a stress stage-specific module enriching in transcription regulator genes. The homologs of several regulators, including splicing and transcription factors, were similarly identified as hub genes operating in the Pst -induced response network. Moreover, the Hsp70 protein were predicted as a key point in protein⁻protein interaction (PPI) networks from STRING database. Taking the genetics resistance gene locus into consideration, we identified 32 induced proteins in chromosome 1BS as potential candidates involved in Pst resistance. This study indicated that the transcriptional regulation model plays an important role in activating resistance-related genes in wheat responding to Pst stress."

"31521219","abstracttext","Alternative splicing (AS) enhances the diversities of both transcripts and proteins in eukaryotes, which contribute to stress adaptation. To catalog wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) AS genes, we characterized 45 RNA-seq libraries from wheat seedlings infected by powdery mildew, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) or stripe rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). We discovered that 11.2% and 10.4% of the multiexon genes had AS transcripts during Bgt and Pst infections, respectively. In response to fungal infection, wheat modulated AS not only in disease resistance proteins, but also in splicing related factors. Apart from the stress induced or activated splicing variants by pathogen, the differential expression profiles were fold increased through changing the ratio of full spliced transcripts versus intron retention (IR) transcripts. Comparing AS transcripts produced by the same gene in Bgt with Pst stress, the spliced terminal exons and the stranded introns are independent and different. This demonstrated that differential induction of specific splice variants were activated against two fungal pathogens. The specific induced AS genes in the Pst-resistant plants were enriched in improving the membrane permeability and protein modification ability, whereas gene expression involved in protein translation and transport were strengthened in Pst-susceptible plants."

"31965231","abstracttext_key message","The semidominant EMS-induced mutant w5 affects epicuticular wax deposition and mapped to an approximately 194-kb region on chromosome 7DL. Epicuticular wax is responsible for the glaucous appearance of plants and protects against many biotic and abiotic stresses. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), β-diketone is a major component of epicuticular wax in adult plants and contributes to the glaucousness of the aerial organs. In the present study, we identified an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced epicuticular wax-deficient mutant from the elite wheat cultivar Jimai22. Compared to wild-type Jimai22, the mutant lacked β-diketone and failed to form the glaucous coating on all aerial organs. The mutant also had significantly increased in cuticle permeability, based on water loss and chlorophyll efflux. Genetic analysis indicated that the mutant phenotype is controlled by a single, semidominant gene on the long arm of chromosome 7D, which was not allelic to the known wax gene loci W1-W4, and was therefore designated W5. W5 was finely mapped to an ~ 194-kb region (flanked by the molecular markers SSR2 and STARP11) that harbored four annotated genes according to the reference genome of Chinese Spring (RefSeq v1.0). Collectively, these data will broaden the knowledge of the genetic basis underlying epicuticular wax deposition in wheat."

"32123996","abstracttext_key message","The TaMP gene from wheat encodes an α-mannosidase induced by salt stress that functions as negative regulator of salt tolerance in plants. Salt stress significantly affects growth and yield of crop plants. The α-mannosidases function in protein folding, trafficking, and endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in eukaryotic cells, and they are involved in abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Previously, we identified the α-mannosidase gene TaMP in wheat (Triticum aestivum). In this study, we investigated the function of TaMP in salt stress tolerance. TaMP expression was induced in wheat leaves by salt, drought, abscisic acid, and H 2 O 2 treatments. Overexpressing TaMP in Brachypodium distachyon was associated with a salt-sensitive phenotype. Under salt stress, the overexpressing plants had reduced height, delayed growth status, low photosynthetic rate, decreased survival rate, and diminished yield. Moreover, the overexpression of TaMP aggravated the tendency for ions to become toxic under salt stress by significantly affecting the Na + and K + contents in cells. In addition, TaMP could negatively regulate salt tolerance by affecting the antioxidant enzyme system capacity and increasing the reactive oxygen species accumulation. Our study was helpful to understand the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms of salt stress tolerance in plants."

"17598566","abstracttext","It is hypothesized that the interaction between aphids and plants follows a gene-for-gene model. The recent appearance of several new Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Homoptera: Aphididae), biotypes in the United States and the differential response of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., genotypes containing different resistance genes also suggest a gene-for-gene interaction. However, aphid elicitors remain unknown. This study was conducted to identify fractionated Russian wheat aphid extracts capable of eliciting differential responses between resistant and susceptible wheat genotypes. We extracted whole soluble compounds and separated proteins and metabolites from two Russian wheat aphid biotypes (1 and 2), injected these extracts into seedlings of susceptible wheat Gamtoos (dn7) and resistant 94M370 (Dn7), and determined phenotypic and biochemical plant responses. Injections of whole extract or protein extract from both biotypes induced the typical susceptible symptom, leaf rolling, in the susceptible cultivar, but not in the resistant cultivar. Furthermore, multiple injections with protein extract from biotype 2 induced the development of chlorosis, head trapping, and stunting in susceptible wheat. Injection with metabolite, buffer, or chitin, did not produce any susceptible symptoms in either genotype. The protein extract from the two biotypes also induced significantly higher activities of three defense-response enzymes (catalase, peroxidase, and beta-glucanase) in 94M370 than in Gamtoos. These results indicate that a protein elicitor from the Russian wheat aphid is recognized by a plant receptor, and the recognition is mediated by the Dn7-gene product. The increased activities of defense-response enzymes in resistant plants after injection with the protein fraction suggest that defense response genes are induced after recognition of aphid elicitors by the plant."

"23124323","abstracttext","Cycles of whole-genome duplication (WGD) and diploidization are hallmarks of eukaryotic genome evolution and speciation. Polyploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) has had a massive increase in genome size largely due to recent WGDs. How these processes may impact the dynamics of gene evolution was studied by comparing the patterns of gene structure changes, alternative splicing (AS), and codon substitution rates among wheat and model grass genomes. In orthologous gene sets, significantly more acquired and lost exonic sequences were detected in wheat than in model grasses. In wheat, 35% of these gene structure rearrangements resulted in frame-shift mutations and premature termination codons. An increased codon mutation rate in the wheat lineage compared with Brachypodium distachyon was found for 17% of orthologs. The discovery of premature termination codons in 38% of expressed genes was consistent with ongoing pseudogenization of the wheat genome. The rates of AS within the individual wheat subgenomes (21%-25%) were similar to diploid plants. However, we uncovered a high level of AS pattern divergence between the duplicated homeologous copies of genes. Our results are consistent with the accelerated accumulation of AS isoforms, nonsynonymous mutations, and gene structure rearrangements in the wheat lineage, likely due to genetic redundancy created by WGDs. Whereas these processes mostly contribute to the degeneration of a duplicated genome and its diploidization, they have the potential to facilitate the origin of new functional variations, which, upon selection in the evolutionary lineage, may play an important role in the origin of novel traits."

However, the LMW-GS gene composition in Aegilops tauschii, the wheat D genome progenitor, has not been comprehensively elucidated and the impact of allohexaploidization on the Glu-D3 locus remains elusive. In this work, using the LMW-GS gene molecular marker system and the full-length gene-cloning method, LMW-GS genes at the Glu-D3 loci of 218 Ae. tauschii and 173 common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were characterized. Each Ae. tauschii contained 11 LMW-GS genes, and the whole collection was divided into 25 haplotypes (AeH01-AeH25). The Glu-D3 locus in common wheat lacked the LMW-GS genes D3-417, D3-507 and D3-552, but shared eight genes of identical open reading frame (ORF) sequences when compared to that of Ae. tauschii. Therefore, the allohexaploidization induces deletions, but exerts no influence on LMW-GS gene coding sequences at the Glu-D3 locus. 92.17% Ae. tauschii had 7-9 LMW-GSs, more than the six subunits in common wheat. The haplotypes AeH16, AeH20 and AeH23 of Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulate distributed in southeastern Caspian Iran were the main putative D genome donor of common wheat. These results facilitate the utilization of the Ae. tauschii glutenin gene resources and the understanding of wheat evolution."

In China, cultivars such as Triticum aestivum 'Xiaoyan No. 6' carrying the 1Bx14 and 1By15 glutenin subunits usually have attributes that result in high-quality bread and noodles. HMW-GS 1Bx14 and 1By15 were isolated by preparative sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and used as an antigen to immunize BALB/c mice. A resulting monoclonal antibody belonging to the IgG1 subclass was shown to bind to all HMW-GSs of Triticum aestivum cultivars, but did not bind to other storage proteins of wheat seeds in a Western blot analysis. After screening a complementary DNA expression library from immature seeds of 'Xiaoyan No. 6' using the monoclonal antibody, the HMW-GS 1By15 gene was isolated and fully sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed an extra stretch of 15 amino acid repeats consisting of a hexapeptide and a nonapeptide in the repetitive domain of this y-type HMW subunit. Bacterial expression of a modified 1By15 gene, in which the coding sequence for the signal peptide was removed and a BamHI site eliminated, gave rise to a protein with mobility identical to that of HMW-GSs extracted from seeds of 'Xiaoyan No. 6' via SDS-PAGE. This approach for isolating genes using specific monoclonal antibody against HMW-GS genes is a good alternative to the extensively used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology based on sequence homology of HMW-GSs in wheat and its relatives."

"18943158","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Host plant resistance is an economical and environmentally sound method of control of leaf rust caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina, which is one of the most serious diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Wild relatives of wheat, including the tetraploid T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum, represent an important source of genes for resistance to leaf rust. The objectives of this study were to (i) evaluate the performance of leaf rust resistance genes previously transferred to wheat from three accessions of T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum, (ii) determine inheritance and allelic relationship of the new leaf rust resistance genes, and (iii) determine the genetic map location of one of the T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum-derived genes using microsatellite markers. The leaf rust resistance gene transferred to hexaploid wheat from accession TA 28 of T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum exhibited slightly different infection types (ITs) to diverse races of leaf rust in inoculated tests of seedlings compared with the gene transferred from TA 870 and TA 874. High ITs were exhibited when seedlings of all the germ plasm lines were inoculated with P. triticina races MBRL and PNMQ. However, low ITs were observed on adult plants of all lines having the T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum-derived genes for resistance in the field at locations in Kansas and Texas. Analysis of crosses between resistant germ plasm lines showed that accessions TA 870 and TA 874 donated the same gene for resistance to leaf rust and TA 28 donated an independent resistance gene. The gene donated to germ plasm line KS96WGRC36 from TA 870 of T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum was linked to microsatellite markers Xgwm382 (6.7 cM) and Xgdm87 (9.4 cM) on wheat chromosome arm 2B long.

"16055679","abstracttext","Vernalization, the requirement of a long exposure to low temperatures to accelerate flowering, is an essential adaptation of plants to cold winters. The vernalization gene VRN-1 plays an important role in this process in diploid (Triticum monococcum) and polyploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). We have recently shown that the diploid wheat VRN-A(m)1 gene was similar to the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L. Heynh.) APETALA1 meristem identity gene. We also showed that dominant Vrn-A(m)1 alleles were the result of loss-of-function mutations in regulatory regions recognized by a VRN-1 repressor, likely VRN-2. This model predicts that only the dominant Vrn-1 allele will be transcribed in lines carrying both recessive and dominant alleles. Here, we confirm this prediction in young isogenic lines of hexaploid wheat carrying different dominant Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1 alleles, and also in heterozygous VRN-1 diploid wheat plants. However, a few weeks later, transcripts from the recessive alleles were also detected in both the polyploid and heterozygous diploid spring plants. Transcription of the recessive alleles was preceded by a reduction of the transcript levels of VRN-2. These results suggest that the dominant Vrn-1 allele or a gene regulated by VRN-1 down-regulates the VRN-2 repressor facilitating the transcription of the recessive alleles in unvernalized plants. We also show here that the level of VRN-1 transcripts in early developmental stages is critical for flowering initiation. A reduction of VRN-1 transcript levels by RNA interference delayed apex transition to the reproductive stage, increased the number of leaves, and delayed heading time by 2 to 3 weeks. We hypothesize that the coordinated transcription of dominant and recessive alleles may contribute to an earlier attainment of the VRN-1 transcript level threshold required to trigger flowering initiation in polyploid wheat."

The calculation of the divergence time revealed that first duplication between 4 and 7 chromosomes of the common ancestor of the Triticeae tribe occurred about 35-46 million years ago (MYA); the last duplication arised about 16-19 MYA before the divergence Triticum and Hordeum genera The connection between gene expression and the appearance of anthocyanin pigmentation was found for three genes from homoeologous group 4 chromosomes: TaMpc1-A2 (5AL) in wheat coleoptile, HvMpc1-H2 (4HL) in barley lemma and aleurone layer, and HvMpc1-H3 (4HL) in barley aleurone layer. TaMpc1-D4 (4DL) from the wheat genome showed a strong level of expression regardless of the colour of coleoptile or pericarp. It is assumed, that this gene regulates the biosynthesis of uncoloured flavonoids in analysed tissues."
"30813913","abstracttext_conclusions","The regulatory R2R3-Myb genes involved in anthocyanin synthesis were identified and characterised in Triticeae tribe species. Genes designated HvMpc1-H2 and HvMpc1-H3 appeared to be the main factors underlying intraspecific variation of H. vulgare by lemma and aleurone colour. TaMpc1-A2 is the co-regulator of the Mpc1-1 genes in bread wheat genome controlling anthocyanin synthesis in coleoptile."

"12029482","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA) induces the expression of a gene encoding a protein kinase, PKABA1, in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Transient expression of the cDNA encoding this kinase suppresses the gibberellin (GA)-induced expression of alpha-amylase genes in barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) aleurone layers. We have cloned the cDNA and genomic sequences for the barley PKABA1 (HvPKABA1) to further study its role in regulating the GA-inducible gene expression in barley seeds. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA shows 97% identity with that of wheat PKABA1. RNA blot analysis indicated that ABA induced, but GA suppressed, the expression of HvPKABA1 in barley seeds. Transient expression of HvPKABA1 also suppressed the GA-inducible alpha-amylase gene expression. These results suggest that HvPKABA1 is probably involved in the signal transduction pathway from ABA to suppress the GA-inducible gene expression. Southern blot analysis showed that HvPKABA1 is likely a single-copy gene in barley. The sequence of the genomic clone reveals that HvPKABA1 consists of eight introns, the first one being more than 6 kb long. The mapped transcription start site of this gene suggests that it may have a TATA-less promoter."

"12582491","abstracttext","Hessian fly is one of the world's most destructive insect pests of wheat Triticum aestivum L. We have used the combination of near-isogenic lines (NIL) and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis to screen up to 2,000 primers to identify DNA markers that are linked to gene H6 that confers resistance to biotype B of the insect. This screen produced six primers that show polymorphic fragments associated with resistance by H6. We have screened 440 F(2) individuals from a cross of the susceptible cultivar Newton and a NIL that contains H6 to verify the linkage between these markers and the resistance gene. A high-resolution genetic map was constructed based on recombination frequency. Two of the markers were tightly linked to the gene with no recombination observed, three were within 2.0 cM, and one was 11 cM from the gene. Three of the six markers were successfully converted to sequence tagged site (STS) markers. Both RAPD and STS primers were used to screen for the presence or absence of the resistance gene in wheat varieties. The identification of markers and construction of the genetic high resolution map provide the first steps toward localization of this resistance gene."

"17612619","abstracttext","The alpha-tubulins and beta-tubulins are the major constituents of microtubules, which have been recognized as important structural elements in cell growth and morphogenesis, and, recently, for their role in regulation and signal transduction. We have identified 15 full-length cDNAs for the members of the alpha-tubulin gene family in hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The genes were clustered into 5 homeologous groups of 3 genes. Representatives of the 5 homeologous groups were mapped to different chromosome arms, and the genome of origin was determined for each gene. Changes in mRNA levels were observed for the paralogous members of the gene family during cold acclimation. Three members of the family had initial decreases in mRNA levels in response to cold treatment, which were followed by increases, each with a different pattern of reinduction. One gene-family member showed increased mRNA for up to 14 d during cold acclimation and had decreased levels after 36 d of cold treatment; a fifth paralogous member of the gene family had slowly declining mRNA levels up to 36 d. Subtle differences in the level of gene expression among homeologs and large differences among paralogs were detected by comparing the relative abundance of wheat alpha-tubulin expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in public databases."

"21437597","abstracttext","Stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn.) (the causal agent of wheat stem rust) race Ug99 (also designated TTKSK) and its derivatives have defeated several important stem rust resistance genes widely used in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production, rendering much of the worldwide wheat acreage susceptible. In order to identify new resistance sources, a large collection of wheat relatives and genetic stocks maintained at the Wheat Genetic and Genomic Resources Center was screened. The results revealed that most accessions of the diploid relative Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy were highly resistant. The screening of a set of wheat-D. villosum chromosome addition lines revealed that the wheat-D. villosum disomic addition line DA6V#3 was moderately resistant to race Ug99. The objective of the present study was to produce and characterize compensating wheat-D. villosum whole arm Robertsonian translocations (RobTs) involving chromosomes 6D of wheat and 6V#3 of D. villosum through the mechanism of centric breakage-fusion. Seven 6V#3-specific EST-STS markers were developed for screening F(2) progeny derived from plants double-monosomic for chromosomes 6D and 6V#3. Surprisingly, although 6D was the target chromosome, all recovered RobTs involved chromosome 6A implying a novel mechanism for the origin of RobTs. Homozygous translocations (T6AS·6V#3L and T6AL·6V#3S) with good plant vigor and full fertility were selected from F(3) families. A stem rust resistance gene was mapped to the long arm 6V#3L in T6AS·6V#3L and was designated as Sr52. Sr52 is temperature-sensitive and is most effective at 16°C, partially effective at 24°C, and ineffective at 28°C. The T6AS·6V#3L stock is a new source of resistance to Ug99, is cytogenetically stable, and may be useful in wheat improvement."

"26220083","abstracttext","Considerable progress has been made in understanding the roles of AGC kinases in mammalian systems. However, very little is known about the roles of AGC kinases in wheat (Triticum aestivum). The necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis is the major pathogen of the destructive disease sharp eyespot of wheat. In this study, the wheat AGC kinase gene TaAGC1, responding to R. cerealis infection, was isolated, and its properties and role in wheat defence were characterized. R. cerealis-resistant wheat lines expressed TaAGC1 at higher levels than susceptible wheat lines. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses showed that the TaAGC1 protein is a serine/threonine kinase belonging to the NDR (nuclear Dbf2-related) subgroup of AGC kinases. Kinase activity assays proved that TaAGC1 is a functional kinase and the Asp-239 residue located in the conserved serine/threonine kinase domain of TaAGC1 is required for the kinase activity. Subcellular localization assays indicated that TaAGC1 localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Virus-induced TaAGC1 silencing revealed that the down-regulation of TaAGC1 transcripts significantly impaired wheat resistance to R. cerealis. The molecular characterization and responses of TaAGC1 overexpressing transgenic wheat plants indicated that TaAGC1 overexpression significantly enhanced resistance to sharp eyespot and reduced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in wheat plants challenged with R. cerealis. Furthermore, ROS-scavenging and certain defence-associated genes were up-regulated in resistant plants overexpressing TaAGC1 but down-regulated in susceptible knock-down plants. These results suggested that the kinase TaAGC1 positively contributes to wheat immunity to R. cerealis through regulating expression of ROS-related and defence-associated genes."
"26717012","articletitle","Analysis of seasonal expression levels of wheat fructan exohydrolase (FEH) genes regulating fructan metabolism involved in wintering ability."
"26717012","abstracttext","In northern regions, winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accumulates fructan during cold-acclimation in autumn and freeze-acclimation in early winter. The content of fructan in wheat crown tissues is associated with both freezing tolerance and snow mold resistance, and expression levels of fructan synthesis genes in leaf and crown tissue are correlated with both changes and varietal differences in fructan accumulation levels of wheat during cold- and freeze-acclimation. Fructan hydrolysis activity has also been thought be involved in wintering ability of wheat. Since several kinds of gene homologs encoding fructan exohydrolase (FEH: EC. 3.2.1.153, 154) with different substrate specificities have recently been cloned from wheat, changes in transcript levels of wheat FEH genes in field-grown wheat cultivars from autumn to spring were analyzed to investigate regulation of seasonal changes in fructan content. The seasonal expression patterns of five genes encoding 1-FEH, 6-FEH (and Wfh-sm3), 6&1-FEH and 6-KEH (kestose exohydrolase) varied. Among the five genes, only seasonal changes in the expression of wfh-sm3, which codes an enzyme that is able to hydrolyze almost all components of fructan that has accumulated in hardened wheat tissues, were correlated with those changes in fructan contents. Moreover, the transcript levels of wfh-sm3 were low in snow mold-resistant cultivars that accumulate high levels of fructan. The transcript levels of 6-FEH increased with decrease in ambient temperatures and the levels decreased under snow. The analysis indicated that cooperative expression of 6-FEH and 1-FEH genes might be related to the seasonal changes and varietal difference in mono- and disaccharide contents. This study showed that the coordinated expression of FEH genes in wheat was related to the regulation of water-soluble carbohydrate accumulation from autumn to early winter and fructan consumption under snow cover as well as energy supply and that wheat FEHs also play an important role in the varietal difference in freezing tolerance and snow mold resistance. In particular, the expression of wfh-sm3 may regulate fructan metabolism associated with tolerance for wintering stresses."

Diploid wheatgrass Lophopyrum elongatum (genomes EE) possesses valuable traits for wheat genetics and breeding. We evaluated several strategies for introgression of this germplasm into wheat. To detect it, we developed and validated multiplexed sets of Sequenom MassARRAY single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, which differentiated disomic and monosomic L. elongatum chromosomes from wheat chromosomes. We identified 130 introgression lines (ILs), which harbored 108 complete and 89 recombined L. elongatum chromosomes. Of the latter, 59 chromosomes were recombined by one or more crossovers and 30 were involved in centromeric (Robertsonian) translocations or were telocentric. To identify wheat chromosomes substituted for or recombined with L. elongatum chromosomes, we genotyped the ILs with the wheat 90-K Infinium SNP array. We found that most of the wheat 90-K probes correctly detected their targets in the L. elongatum genome and showed that some wheat SNPs are ancient and had originated prior to the divergence of the wheat and L. elongatum lineages. Of the 130 ILs, 52% were homozygous for Ph1 deletion and thus are staged to be recombined further. We failed to detect in the L. elongatum genome the 4/5 reciprocal translocation that has been reported in Thinopyrum bessarabicum and several other Triticeae genomes."

"20553621","abstracttext_background","Physical maps employing libraries of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones are essential for comparative genomics and sequencing of large and repetitive genomes such as those of the hexaploid bread wheat. The diploid ancestor of the D-genome of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), Aegilops tauschii, is used as a resource for wheat genomics. The barley diploid genome also provides a good model for the Triticeae and T. aestivum since it is only slightly larger than the ancestor wheat D genome. Gene co-linearity between the grasses can be exploited by extrapolating from rice and Brachypodium distachyon to Ae. tauschii or barley, and then to wheat."
"20553621","abstracttext_results","We report the use of Ae. tauschii for the construction of the physical map of a large distal region of chromosome arm 3DS. A physical map of 25.4 Mb was constructed by anchoring BAC clones of Ae. tauschii with 85 EST on the Ae. tauschii and barley genetic maps. The 24 contigs were aligned to the rice and B. distachyon genomic sequences and a high density SNP genetic map of barley. As expected, the mapped region is highly collinear to the orthologous chromosome 1 in rice, chromosome 2 in B. distachyon and chromosome 3H in barley. However, the chromosome scale of the comparative maps presented provides new insights into grass genome organization. The disruptions of the Ae. tauschii-rice and Ae. tauschii-Brachypodium syntenies were identical. We observed chromosomal rearrangements between Ae. tauschii and barley. The comparison of Ae. tauschii physical and genetic maps showed that the recombination rate across the region dropped from 2.19 cM/Mb in the distal region to 0.09 cM/Mb in the proximal region. The size of the gaps between contigs was evaluated by comparing the recombination rate along the map with the local recombination rates calculated on single contigs."
"20553621","abstracttext_conclusions","The physical map reported here is the first physical map using fingerprinting of a complete Triticeae genome. This study demonstrates that global fingerprinting of the large plant genomes is a viable strategy for generating physical maps. Physical maps allow the description of the co-linearity between wheat and grass genomes and provide a powerful tool for positional cloning of new genes."

"17262197","abstracttext","The MRE11 protein is a component of the highly conserved MRN complex, along with RAD50 and NBS1. This complex is crucial in the repair of breaks in double stranded DNA, and is involved in many other cell processes. The present paper reports the molecular characterization of Mre11 gene in all three genomes of wheat, making use of the diploid species Triticum monococcum (genome A) and Aegilops Tauschii (genome D), the tetraploid T. turgidum (genomes A and B), and the hexaploid T. aestivum (genomes A, B and D). The genomic sequences characterized ranged from 4,662 to 4,766 bp in length; the cDNA corresponding to the processed mRNA was 2,440-2,510 bp long. In all cases, Mre11 coded for a highly conserved protein of 699 amino acids with a structure involving 22 exons. Mre11 expression was determined by real-time PCR in all the species analysed. The tetraploid species showed an expression similar to that of the diploid Ae. tauschii and lower than that of T. monococcum. Stronger expression was detected in the hexaploid T. aestivum. The SSCP technique was modified by introducing fluorescent labelling to the procedure in order to analyse the expression of the different Mre11 genes (i.e., those belonging to the different genomes) in the polyploid species. In both polyploids, the Mre11 gene belonging to the B genome was the least expressed. This probably reflects a first step in the process of silencing duplicate genes after polyploidization."

"29258426","abstracttext_background","A large number of disease resistance genes or QTLs in crop plants are identified through conventional genetics and genomic tools, but their functional or molecular characterization remains costly, labor-intensive and inaccurate largely due to the lack of deep sequencing of large and complex genomes of many important crops such as allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). On the other hand, gene annotation and relevant genomic resources for disease resistance and other defense-related traits are more abundant in model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The objectives of this study are (i) to infer homology of defense-related genes in Arabidopsis and wheat and (ii) to classify these homologous genes into different gene families."
"29258426","abstracttext_results","We employed three bioinformatics and genomics approaches to identifying candidate genes known to affect plant defense and to classifying these protein-coding genes into different gene families in Arabidopsis. These approaches predicted up to 1790 candidate genes in 11 gene families for Arabidopsis defense to biotic stresses. The 11 gene families included ABC, NLR and START, the three families that are already known to confer rust resistance in wheat, and eight new families. The distributions of predicted SNPs for individual rust resistance genes were highly skewed towards specific gene families, including eight one-to-one uniquely matched pairs: Lr21-NLR, Lr34-ABC, Lr37-START, Sr2-Cupin, Yr24-Transcription factor, Yr26-Transporter, Yr36-Kinase and Yr53-Kinase. Two of these pairs, Lr21-NLR and Lr34-ABC, are expected because Lr21 and Lr34 are well known to confer race-specific and race-nonspecific resistance to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and they encode NLR and ABC proteins."
"29258426","abstracttext_conclusions","Our inference of 11 known and new gene families enhances current understanding of functional diversity with defense-related genes in genomes of model plant Arabidopsis and cereal crop wheat. Our comparative genomic analysis of Arabidopsis and wheat genomes is complementary to the conventional map-based or marker-based approaches for identification of genes or QTLs for rust resistance genes in wheat and other cereals. Race-specific and race-nonspecific candidate genes predicted by our study may be further tested and combined in breeding for durable resistance to wheat rusts and other pathogens."

"16767178","abstracttext","The US Wheat Genome Project, funded by the National Science Foundation, developed the first large public Triticeae expressed sequence tag (EST) resource. Altogether, 116,272 ESTs were produced, comprising 100,674 5' ESTs and 15 598 3' ESTs. These ESTs were derived from 42 cDNA libraries, which were created from hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and its close relatives, including diploid wheat (T. monococcum L. and Aegilops speltoides L.), tetraploid wheat (T. turgidum L.), and rye (Secale cereale L.), using tissues collected from various stages of plant growth and development and under diverse regimes of abiotic and biotic stress treatments. ESTs were assembled into 18,876 contigs and 23,034 singletons, or 41,910 wheat unigenes. Over 90% of the contigs contained fewer than 10 EST members, implying that the ESTs represented a diverse selection of genes and that genes expressed at low and moderate to high levels were well sampled. Statistical methods were used to study the correlation of gene expression patterns, based on the ESTs clustered in the 1536 contigs that contained at least 10 5' EST members and thus representing the most abundant genes expressed in wheat. Analysis further identified genes in wheat that were significantly upregulated (p < 0.05) in tissues under various abiotic stresses when compared with control tissues. Though the function annotation cannot be assigned for many of these genes, it is likely that they play a role associated with the stress response. This study predicted the possible functionality for 4% of total wheat unigenes, which leaves the remaining 96% with their functional roles and expression patterns largely unknown. Nonetheless, the EST data generated in this project provide a diverse and rich source for gene discovery in wheat."

Heat, drought and their combination dramatically reduce wheat yield and quality, but the molecular mechanisms underlying wheat tolerance to extreme environments, especially stress combination, are largely unknown. As an allohexaploid, wheat consists of three closely related subgenomes (A, B, and D), and was reported to show improved tolerance to stress conditions compared to tetraploid. But so far very little is known about how wheat coordinates the expression of homeologous genes to cope with various environmental constraints on the whole-genome level."
"26092253","abstracttext_results","To explore the transcriptional response of wheat to the individual and combined stress, we performed high-throughput transcriptome sequencing of seedlings under normal condition and subjected to drought stress (DS), heat stress (HS) and their combination (HD) for 1 h and 6 h, and presented global gene expression reprograms in response to these three stresses. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of DS, HS and HD responsive genes revealed an overlap and complexity of functional pathways between each other. Moreover, 4,375 wheat transcription factors were identified on a whole-genome scale based on the released scaffold information by IWGSC, and 1,328 were responsive to stress treatments. Then, the regulatory network analysis of HSFs and DREBs implicated they were both involved in the regulation of DS, HS and HD response and indicated a cross-talk between heat and drought stress. Finally, approximately 68.4 % of homeologous genes were found to exhibit expression partitioning in response to DS, HS or HD, which was further confirmed by using quantitative RT-PCR and Nullisomic-Tetrasomic lines."

However, the ATG6 functions in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), an important food crop, are lacking."
"25888209","abstracttext_results","We identified three members, TaATG6a-6c, of the ATG6 family from common wheat. TaATG6a, 6b and 6c were localized on homeologous chromosomes 3DL, 3BL and 3AL, respectively, of the allo-hexaploid wheat genome, and evidence was provided for their essential role in autophagy. The TaATG6a-GFP fusion protein was found in punctate pre-autophagosomal structures. The expression of each TaATG6 gene restored the accumulation of autophagic bodies in atg6-mutant yeast. Additionally, TaATG6 knockdown plants showed impaired constitutive and pathogen-induced autophagy and growth abnormalities under normal conditions. We also examined the expression patterns of wheat ATG6s for clues to their physiological roles, and found that their expression was induced by the fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), the causal agent of powdery mildew, and by abiotic stress factors. A role for TaATG6s in wheat immunity to powdery mildew was further implied when knockdowns of TaATG6s weakly compromised the broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21-triggered resistance response and, conversely and significantly, enhanced the basal resistance of susceptible plants. In addition, leaf cell death was sometimes induced by growth-retarded small Bgt mycelia on susceptible TaATG6 knockdown plants after a long period of interaction. Thus, we provide an important extension of the previous characterization of plant ATG6 genes in wheat, and observed a role for autophagy genes in wheat immune responses to fungal pathogens."

The Qsd1 sequence in A genome diploid wheat is highly similar to that in the hexaploid A sub-genome. Wheat orthologs of Qsd1 showed closer similarities to barley Qsd1 than did those of other accessions in the DNA database. Like barley Qsd1, all three wheat Qsd1s showed embryo-specific gene expression patterns, indicating that barley and wheat Qsd1 share an orthologous origin.

"30727122","abstracttext","Pathogenic races of Tilletia caries and T. foetida, which cause common bunt of wheat (Triticum aestivum), and Tilletia contraversa, which causes dwarf bunt of wheat, have been identified previously by their reaction to 10 differential wheat lines, each containing single bunt resistance genes Bt1 through Bt10. The reactions of races to the differential wheat lines follow the classic gene-for gene system for host-pathogen interactions. The pathogens are closely related and resistance to both diseases in wheat is controlled by the same genes. To better define pathogenic races, six additional wheat lines containing the genes Bt11 through Bt15 and a wheat line with a resistance factor designated as Btp were added to the set of 10 differentials and tested with all named U.S. races of common bunt and dwarf bunt. In addition, new isolates of dwarf bunt, and common bunt from hybrids and field collections, were tested with all 16 differentials for race identification. Six new races of T. caries, five new races of T. foetida, and two new races of T. contraversa were identified. Races of common bunt virulent to Bt8 or Bt12, and dwarf bunt races virulent to the combinations of Bt11 and Bt12, and Bt8, Bt9, Bt10, Bt11, and Bt12, were identified for the first time. Comparison of the reactions of the common bunt races with the Bt14 and Bt15 differentials grown in different environments after initial infection showed that these genes are temperature sensitive, indicating they should be excluded from the set of differential lines to avoid ambiguity in determining virulent or avirulent reactions. In the previous list of bunt races, there were races that had the same reaction to the set of 10 differentials but were designated as different races. These races were not differentiated further with the six additional differentials, indicating that the duplicate races should be dropped from the list of pathogenic races. The new races of common bunt and dwarf bunt identified have unique patterns of virulence that allow specific targeting and elucidation of bunt resistance genes in wheat and will aid the development of bunt-resistant wheat cultivars."

"24504553","abstracttext_key message","Wheat lines carrying Ug99-effective stem rust resistance gene Sr43 on shortened alien chromosome segments were produced using chromosome engineering, and molecular markers linked to Sr43 were identified for marker-assisted selection. Stem rust resistance gene Sr43, transferred into common wheat (Triticum aestivum) from Thinopyrum ponticum, is an effective gene against stem rust Ug99 races. However, this gene has not been used in wheat breeding because it is located on a large Th. ponticum 7el(2) chromosome segment, which also harbors genes for undesirable traits. The objective of this study was to eliminate excessive Th. ponticum chromatin surrounding Sr43 to make it usable in wheat breeding. The two original translocation lines KS10-2 and KS24-1 carrying Sr43 were first analyzed using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and florescent genomic in situ hybridization. Six SSR markers located on wheat chromosome arm 7DL were identified to be associated with the Th. ponticum chromatin in KS10-2 and KS24-1. The results confirmed that KS24-1 is a 7DS·7el(2)L Robertsonian translocation as previously reported. However, KS10-2, which was previously designated as a 7el(2)S·7el(2)L-7DL translocation, was identified as a 7DS-7el(2)S·7el(2)L translocation. To reduce the Th. ponticum chromatin carrying Sr43, a BC(2)F(1) population (Chinese Spring//Chinese Spring ph1bph1b*2/KS10-2) containing ph1b-induced homoeologous recombinants was developed, tested with stem rust, and genotyped with the six SSR markers identified above. Two new wheat lines (RWG33 and RWG34) carrying Sr43 on shortened alien chromosome segments (about 17.5 and 13.7 % of the translocation chromosomes, respectively) were obtained, and two molecular markers linked to Sr43 in these lines were identified.

Interspecific hybridization is widely used in plant breeding to increase genetic diversity and introgress new traits. Numerous introgression stocks were developed for hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum L. (2n = 6x = 42, genome AABBDD). Double monosomic lines, containing one alien chromosome from the tertiary gene pool of wheat and one homoeologous wheat chromosome, represent a simplified model for studying chromosome rearrangements caused by interspecific hybridization. The pairing of a chromosome from the tertiary gene pool with a wheat homoeologue is restricted by the activity of the wheat Ph1 gene, thus, rearrangements caused by chromosome breakage followed by the fusion of the broken arms can be expected. We analyzed chromosome aberrations in 4 sets of lines that originated from double monosomics of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) chromosome 7H and wheat group-7 chromosomes with dicentric or ring chromosomes. The dynamics of wheat-barley dicentric chromosomes during plant development was followed and an increased diversity of rearrangements was observed. Besides the targeted group-7 chromosomes, other wheat chromosomes were involved in rearrangements, as chromosomes broken in the centromeric region fused with other broken chromosomes. In some cells, multi-centric chromosomes were observed. The structure and dosage of the introgressed barley chromatin was changed. The transmission of the rearrangements to the progenies was analyzed. The observed aberrations emphasize the importance of cytogenetic screening in gene introgression projects."

"32281004","abstracttext_key message","Heterogeneous Lr34 genes for leaf rust in winter wheat cultivar 'Duster' and KASP markers for allelic variation in exon 11 and exon 22 of Lr34. Wheat, Triticum aestivum (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD), is a hexaploid species, and each of three homoeologous genomes A, B, and D should have one copy for a gene in its ancestral form if the gene has no duplication. Previously reported leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 has one copy on the short arm of chromosome 7D in hexaploid wheat, and allelic variation in Lr34 is in intron 4, exon 11, exon 12, or exon 22. In this study, we discovered that Oklahoma hard red winter wheat cultivar 'Duster' (PI 644,016) has two copies of the Lr34 gene, the resistance allele Lr34a and the susceptibility allele Lr34b. Both Lr34a and Lr34b were mapped in the same linkage group on chromosome 7D in a doubled-haploid population generated from a cross between Duster and a winter wheat cultivar 'Billings' which carries the susceptibility allele Lr34c. A chromosomal fragment including Lr34 and at least two neighboring genes on its proximal side but excluding genes on its distal side was duplicated in Duster. The Duster Lr34ab allele was associated with tip necrosis and increased resistance against leaf rust at adult plants in the Duster × Billings DH population tested in the field, demonstrating the function of the Duster Lr34ab allele in wheat. We have developed KASP markers for allelic variation in exon 11 and exon 22 of Lr34 in wheat. These markers can be utilized to accelerate the selection of Lr34 in wheat."

"19935928","abstracttext","Common wheat cultivars are resistant to Magnaporthe grisea, a crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis)-specific species of the blast fungus. To dissect the genetic basis of this ""nonhost"" type of resistance, we need an exceptional cultivar that is susceptible to M. grisea. A screening under various conditions revealed that Triticum aestivum 'Chinese Spring' (CS) was susceptible to M. grisea isolate Dig41 when incubated at high temperature (26 degrees C) after inoculation. By contrast, T. aestivum 'P168', 'Shin-chunaga' (Sch), 'Norin 4' (N4), 'Norin 26' (N26), 'Norin 29' (N29), 'Red Egyptian' (RE), and 'Salmon' (Slm) and Triticum compactum 'No. 44' (Cmp) were highly resistant even at the high temperature. When F2 seedlings derived from crosses between the resistant cultivars and CS were inoculated with Dig41, they segregated in a 3:1 ratio of resistant to susceptible, suggesting that the resistance of each cultivar is controlled by one major gene. Crosses of N4 with P168, Sch, N26, N29, and Cmp yielded no susceptible F2 seedlings, suggesting that these six cultivars share the same gene. Similarly, a cross between RE and Slm yielded no susceptible F2 seedlings, suggesting that these two cultivars share the same gene. On the other hand, crosses between the N4 group and the RE group produced resistant and susceptible seedlings in a 15:1 ratio, indicating that these two groups carry different genes inherited independently. The gene in N4 was located on chromosome 4A by a monosomic analysis and designated Rmg4, while the gene in RE was located on chromosome 6D using a series of chromosome substitution lines and designated Rmg5. These results suggest that the resistance of common wheat to M. grisea, an inappropriate species of the blast fungus, is under a simple genetic control."

"23377571","abstracttext","Wheat production is currently threatened by widely virulent races of the wheat stem rust fungus, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, that are part of the TTKSK (also known as 'Ug99') race group. The diploid D genome donor species Aegilops tauschii (2n = 2x = 14, DD) is a readily accessible source of resistance to TTKSK and its derivatives that can be transferred to hexaploid wheat, Triticum aestivum (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD). To expedite transfer of TTKSK resistance from Ae. tauschii, a direct hybridization approach was undertaken that integrates gene transfer, mapping, and introgression into one process. Direct crossing of Ae. tauschii accessions with an elite wheat breeding line combines the steps of gene transfer and introgression while development of mapping populations during gene transfer enables the identification of closely linked markers. Direct crosses were made using TTKSK-resistant Ae. tauschii accessions TA1662 and PI 603225 as males and a stem rust-susceptible T. aestivum breeding line, KS05HW14, as a female. Embryo rescue enabled recovery of F1 (ABDD) plants that were backcrossed as females to the hexaploid recurrent parent. Stem rust-resistant BC1F1 plants from each Ae. tauschii donor source were used as males to generate BC2F1 mapping populations. Bulked segregant analysis of BC2F1 genotypes was performed using 70 SSR loci distributed across the D genome. Using this approach, stem rust resistance genes from both accessions were located on chromosome arm 1DS and mapped using SSR and EST-STS markers. An allelism test indicated the stem rust resistance gene transferred from PI 603225 is Sr33. Race specificity suggests the stem rust resistance gene transferred from TA1662 is unique and this gene has been temporarily designated SrTA1662. Stem rust resistance genes derived from TA1662 and PI 603225 have been made available with selectable molecular markers in genetic backgrounds suitable for stem rust resistance breeding."

"19175767","abstracttext","To elucidate the genetic mechanism of flowering in wheat, we performed expression, mutant and transgenic studies of flowering-time genes. A diurnal expression analysis revealed that a flowering activator VRN1, an APETALA1/FRUITFULL homolog in wheat, was expressed in a rhythmic manner in leaves under both long-day (LD) and short-day (SD) conditions. Under LD conditions, the upregulation of VRN1 during the light period was followed by the accumulation of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) transcripts. Furthermore, FT was not expressed in a maintained vegetative phase (mvp) mutant of einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum), which has null alleles of VRN1, and never transits from the vegetative to the reproductive phase. These results suggest that VRN1 is upstream of FT and upregulates the FT expression under LD conditions. The overexpression of FT in a transgenic bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) caused extremely early heading with the upregulation of VRN1 and the downregulation of VRN2, a putative repressor gene of VRN1. These results suggest that in the transgenic plant, FT suppresses VRN2 expression, leading to an increase in VRN1 expression. Based on these results, we present a model for a genetic network of flowering-time genes in wheat leaves, in which VRN1 is upstream of FT with a positive feedback loop through VRN2. The mvp mutant has a null allele of VRN2, as well as of VRN1, because it was obtained from a spring einkorn wheat strain lacking VRN2. The fact that FT is not expressed in the mvp mutant supports the present model."

"24737716","abstracttext_methods","A 4D(4B) substitution line of durum wheat 'Langdon' was backcrossed to 'Jandaroi', a current semi-dwarf Australian durum. In the second backcross, using 'Jandaroi' as the recurrent parent, a seedling was identified where TaALMT1 on chromosome 4D was recombined with the Rht-B1b locus on chromosome 4B to yield an Al(3+)-tolerant seedling with a semi-dwarf habit. This seedling was used in a third backcross to generate homozygous sister lines with contrasting Al(3+) tolerances. The backcrossed lines were characterized and compared with selected cultivars of hexaploid wheat for their Al(3+) and Na(+) tolerances in hydroponic culture as well as in short-term experiments to assess their growth on acid soil."
"24737716","abstracttext_key results","Analysis of sister lines derived from the third backcross showed that the 4D chromosomal fragment substantially enhanced Al(3+) tolerance. The ability to exclude Na(+) from leaves was also enhanced, indicating that the chromosomal fragment possessed the Kna1 salt tolerance locus. Although Al(3+) tolerance of seminal roots was enhanced in acid soil, the development of fine roots was not as robust as found in Al(3+)-tolerant lines of hexaploid wheat. Analysis of plant characteristics in the absence of Al(3+) toxicity showed that the introgressed fragment did not affect total grain yield but reduced the weight of individual grains."
"24737716","abstracttext_conclusions","The results show that it is possible to increase substantially the Al(3+) tolerance of an elite durum wheat cultivar by introgression of a 4D chromosomal fragment. Further improvements are possible, such as introducing additional genes to enhance the Al(3+) tolerance of fine roots and by eliminating the locus on the chromosomal fragment responsible for smaller grain weights."

"30074999","abstracttext","A comprehensive understanding of wheat responses to environmental stress will contribute to the long-term goal of feeding the planet. ALERNATIVE OXIDASE (AOX) genes encode proteins involved in a bypass of the electron transport chain and are also known to be involved in stress tolerance in multiple species. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the AOX gene family in diploid and hexaploid wheat. Four genes each were found in the diploid ancestors Triticum urartu, and Aegilops tauschii, and three in Aegilops speltoides. In hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), 20 genes were identified, some with multiple splice variants, corresponding to a total of 24 proteins for those with observed transcription and translation. These proteins were classified as AOX1a, AOX1c, AOX1e or AOX1d via phylogenetic analysis. Proteins lacking most or all signature AOX motifs were assigned to putative regulatory roles. Analysis of protein-targeting sequences suggests mixed localization to the mitochondria and other organelles. In comparison to the most studied AOX from Trypanosoma brucei, there were amino acid substitutions at critical functional domains indicating possible role divergence in wheat or grasses in general. In hexaploid wheat, AOX genes were expressed at specific developmental stages as well as in response to both biotic and abiotic stresses such as fungal pathogens, heat and drought. These AOX expression patterns suggest a highly regulated and diverse transcription and expression system. The insights gained provide a framework for the continued and expanded study of AOX genes in wheat for stress tolerance through breeding new varieties, as well as resistance to AOX-targeted herbicides, all of which can ultimately be used synergistically to improve crop yield."

"32884413","abstracttext","Wheat ( Triticum L.) is one of the major food crops of the world, and an important component of food security. The aim of this study was to collect and preserve seeds of wheat growing in eight regions of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (Al-Qassim, Asir, Al-Taif, Najran, AL-Baha, Jazan, Al-Madinah and Wadi Al-Dawasir) where wheat has been cultivated since ancient times. Sixty-one accessions/samples of wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) were collected and placed in dry storage ( ex-situ conservation) at -18 °C (i.e. permanent storage). The accessions of local wheat have the ability to grow under harsh environmental conditions such as (high temperature, drought and salinity). Most of these samples were collected directly from farms, but a few were collected from markets. The most important criteria for ex-situ conservation is that seeds need to have a low moisture content (MC) and a high percentage viability. Seed MC was measured for all 61 accessions by the oven-drying method and seed viability was tested in three ways: percentage of germination, tetrazolium chloride testing, and X-ray radiography. The seed MC of the 61 accessions was uniformly very low (0.10-0.12%), and 97 to 100% of the seeds were viable. Thus, all 61 wheat accessions collected in this study have the initial requirements to remain viable for long periods of time in ex-situ conservation in the gene seed bank."
"30792353","articletitle","Unleashing floret fertility in wheat through the mutation of a homeobox gene."
"30792353","abstracttext","Floret fertility is a key determinant of the number of grains per inflorescence in cereals. During the evolution of wheat ( Triticum sp.), floret fertility has increased, such that current bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) cultivars set three to five grains per spikelet. However, little is known regarding the genetic basis of floret fertility. The locus Grain Number Increase 1 ( GNI1 ) is shown here to be an important contributor to floret fertility. GNI1 evolved in the Triticeae through gene duplication. The gene, which encodes a homeodomain leucine zipper class I (HD-Zip I) transcription factor, was expressed most abundantly in the most apical floret primordia and in parts of the rachilla, suggesting that it acts to inhibit rachilla growth and development. The level of GNI1 expression has decreased over the course of wheat evolution under domestication, leading to the production of spikes bearing more fertile florets and setting more grains per spikelet. Genetic analysis has revealed that the reduced-function allele GNI-A1 contributes to the increased number of fertile florets per spikelet. The RNAi-based knockdown of GNI1 led to an increase in the number of both fertile florets and grains in hexaploid wheat. Mutants carrying an impaired GNI-A1 allele out-yielded WT allele carriers under field conditions. The data show that gene duplication generated evolutionary novelty affecting floret fertility while mutations favoring increased grain production have been under selection during wheat evolution under domestication."

Hartog) were electroporated in the presence of plasmid pEmuGN and/or pEmuPAT, which contained the reporter gene gus and selectable marker gene bar, respectively. Under optimised electroporation conditions, up to 0.9% of viable protoplasts displayed gus activity two days after electroporation. To select for phosphinothricin (PPT) resistant colonies, electroporated protoplasts were incubated for six weeks in a medium containing 10 μg/ml PPT. The cells surviving the selection were maintained as individual colonies on solid medium or as suspension cultures. More than 60% of these colonies exhibited tolerance to 40 μg/ml PPT when tested 10 months after initial selection. To date, 57 green plants have been regenerated from these colonies and 24 have been transferred to soil. Southern blot analyses of colonies and plants, using the bar gene sequence as the probe, confirmed transformation of the cells. Positive PAT assays of both regenerated colonies and plants indicated the presence of the bar gene product. These results provide a basis for the establishment of routine procedures for transformation of wheat by direct gene transfer into protoplasts."

"25336565","abstracttext","The first seedling or all-stage resistance (R) R gene against stripe rust isolated from Moro wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using a map-based cloning approach was identified as Yr10. Clone 4B of this gene encodes a highly evolutionary-conserved and unique CC-NBS-LRR sequence. Clone 4E, a homolog of Yr10, but lacking transcription start site (TSS) and putative TATA-box and CAAT-box, is likely a non-expressed pseudogene. Clones 4B and 4E are 84% identical and divergent in the intron and the LRR domain. Gene silencing and transgenesis were used in conjunction with inoculation with differentially avirulent and virulent stripe rust strains to demonstrate Yr10 functionality. The Yr10 CC-NBS-LRR sequence is unique among known CC-NBS-LRR R genes in wheat but highly conserved homologs (E = 0.0) were identified in Aegilops tauschii and other monocots including Hordeum vulgare and Brachypodium distachyon. Related sequences were also identified in genomic databases of maize, rice, and in sorghum. This is the first report of a CC-NBS-LRR resistance gene in plants with limited homologies in its native host, but with numerous homologous R genes in related monocots that are either host or non-hosts for stripe rust. These results represent a unique example of gene evolution and dispersion across species."

LrSV2 is a race-specific adult plant leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) resistance gene on subdistal chromosome 3BS detected in the cross of the traditional Argentinean wheat (Triticum aestivum) variety Sinvalocho MA and the experimental line Gama6. The analysis of the cross of R46 [recombinant inbred line (RIL) derived from Sinvalocho MA carrying LrSV2 gene and the complementary gene Lrc-SV2 identified in the current paper] and the commercial variety Relmo Siriri (not carrying neither of these two genes) allowed the detection of the unlinked complementary gene Lrc-SV2 because the presence of one dominant allele of both is necessary to express the LrSV2-specific adult plant resistance. Lrc-SV2 was mapped within a 1-cM interval on chromosome 4BL using 100 RILs from the cross Sinvalocho MA × Purple Straw. This genetic system resembles the Lr27+31 seedling resistance reported in the Australian varieties Gatcher and Timgalen where interacting genes map at similar chromosomal positions. However, in high-resolution maps, Lr27 and LrSV2 were already mapped to adjacent intervals on 3BS and Lrc-SV2 map position on 4BL is distal to the reported Lr12/31-flanking microsatellites."

"27160855","abstracttext_key message","SNP markers were developed for the OWBM resistance gene Sm1 that will be useful for MAS. The wheat Sm1 region is collinear with an inverted syntenic interval in B. distachyon. Orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM, Sitodiplosis mosellana Géhin) is an important insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in many growing regions. Sm1 is the only described OWBM resistance gene and is the foundation of managing OWBM through host genetics. Sm1 was previously mapped to wheat chromosome arm 2BS relative to simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and the dominant, sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker WM1. The objectives of this research were to saturate the Sm1 region with markers, develop improved markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS), and examine the synteny between wheat, Brachypodium distachyon, and rice (Oryza sativa) in the Sm1 region. The present study mapped Sm1 in four populations relative to single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), SSRs, Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers, single strand conformation polymorphisms (SSCPs), and the SCAR WM1. Numerous high quality SNP assays were designed that mapped near Sm1. BLAST delineated the syntenic intervals in B. distachyon and rice using gene-based SNPs as query sequences. The Sm1 region in wheat was inverted relative to B. distachyon and rice, which suggests a chromosomal rearrangement within the Triticeae lineage. Seven SNPs were tested on a collection of wheat lines known to carry Sm1 and not to carry Sm1. Sm1-flanking SNPs were identified that were useful for predicting the presence or absence of Sm1 based upon haplotype. These SNPs will be a major improvement for MAS of Sm1 in wheat breeding programs."

"32892289","abstracttext_key message","Genome-wide identification, classification, functional characterization and expression analysis of Auxin Responsive Factor (ARF) gene family in wheat reveal their attributes and role during leaf rust infection. Auxins are important plant growth regulators that also impact plant-pathogen interaction. Auxin responsive factors (ARF) are plant specific transcription factors that control responses to auxins. Whole genome investigation of ARF gene family is limited in allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Comprehensive study of this gene family was carried out by employing the currently available reference genome sequence of wheat. In total, 27 ARF genes were identified and located on the wheat genome as well as were positioned on wheat chromosome arms. Additionally, examination of the predicted genes unveiled a decent degree of relatedness within and among the phylogenetic clades. Leaf rust, caused by the obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen Puccinia triticina, is responsible for drastic loss of wheat crop worldwide reducing grain yield by 10-90%. Expression profiling of ARF genes in retort to leaf rust infection indicated their differential regulation during this plant-pathogen interaction. Highest expression of ARF genes were observed at 12 hpi that was maintained up to 72 hpi during incompatible interaction, whereas the high expression levels receded at 48 hpi during compatible interactions. Few of the identified ARF genes were likely to be post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNAs. Many light and stress responsive elements were detected in the promoter regions of ARF genes. Microsynteny analysis showed the conservation of ARF genes within the members of the Poaceae family. This study provides fundamental details for understanding the different types of ARF genes in wheat and there putative roles during leaf rust-wheat interaction."

"8022939","abstracttext","Five different cDNAs (termed wali1 to wali5 for Wheat Aluminum Induced) whose expression was induced by Al stress have been isolated from the root tips of Al-treated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants. Four of these genes were induced 24 to 96 h after Al treatment, and their expression is reduced when the Al is removed. Each of these four genes was induced by inhibitory levels of Al in two wheat cultivars--Warigal, an Al-sensitive cultivar, and Waalt, an Al-tolerant cultivar. The fifth gene (wali2) showed a complex bimodal pattern of induction and was induced by Al only in the sensitive cultivar. Comparison of the nucleotide sequences of these clones to those in the sequence data bases showed that wali4 is homologous to phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and wali1 is homologous to a group of plant proteins that are cysteine-rich and have homology to metallothioneins. wali2 encodes a novel protein with a repeating motif of cysteine amino acids. The remaining two wali clones (wali3 and wali5) encode related, cysteine-rich proteins that show no significant homology to any known sequences."

These proteins were overexpressed in vitro in both nonembryogenic callus and embryogenic cultures. An additional soluble protein (32 kD) was detected by anti-G alpha antibodies in cultured tissues but not in immature embryos, suggesting a possible function in cell multiplication. Moreover, somatic embryogenesis was associated with the appearance of a 29-kD protein reactive with anti-arrstin antibodies, both in soluble and membrane fractions. Tissue-cultured genetic stocks of Chinese Spring wheat, including the disomic, 36 ditelosomic, and 6 nullisomic-tetrasomic wheat lines, were used to ascertain the chromosomal location of the genes encoding the 29-kD arrestin-like protein. The lack of a signal with the nonembryogenic ditelosomic 3 D short chromosome arm line suggests that the 3 D long chromosome arm possesses at least one gene involved in the expression of the 29-kD protein. The putative role of the 29-kD protein in signal-transduction regulating embryogenesis is discussed."

Here we report mapping of 7104 expressed sequence tag (EST) unigenes by Southern hybridization into a chromosome bin map using a set of wheat aneuploids and deletion stocks. Each EST detected a mean of 4.8 restriction fragments and 2.8 loci. More loci were mapped in the B genome (5774) than in the A (5173) or D (5146) genomes. The EST density was significantly higher for the D genome than for the A or B. In general, EST density increased relative to the physical distance from the centromere. The majority of EST-dense regions are in the distal parts of chromosomes. Most of the agronomically important genes are located in EST-dense regions. The chromosome bin map of ESTs is a unique resource for SNP analysis, comparative mapping, structural and functional analysis, and polyploid evolution, as well as providing a framework for constructing a sequence-ready, BAC-contig map of the wheat genome."

Inhibition of nematode reproduction was rank-ordered as Cre1 >or = Cre4 > or = Cre7 >> Cre8 > Cre3. Lines carrying Cre1, Cre4, or Cre7 exhibited a significantly higher level of resistance than those carrying Cre8 or Cre3. Allelism tests indicated that Cre7 segregated independently of Cre1 on chromosome 2BL and Cre4 on chromosome 2DL, and these genes could consistently be combined in the same genotype, inducing a more durable resistance. Tests to determine the chromosomal location of Cre7 using addition lines were inconclusive."

Genetic relationships of 112 wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell.) lines were estimated using 41 DNA clones hybridizing to 273 DNA fragments and by calculating coefficient of parentage (COP). Heterosis was estimated for 722 hybrids grown in multiple locations, with 189 being tested in more than 1 year. The average RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) based genetic distance index (DI) was 0.35. Midparent heterosis for grain yield ranged from &minus;20 to 57% and high-parent heterosis from &minus;22 to 47%. The correlation between RFLP-based estimates of genetic distance and COP was nonsignificant (&minus;0.33). Coefficient of parentage was significantly correlated with heterosis for all traits in 1991 but not in other years. Genetic distance based on RFLPs scored in this study was not correlated with heterosis in any of the years tested.

"15300380","abstracttext","The genetic map of rye contains predominantly restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers but also a limited number of microsatellite markers, which are known to be more reliable and easier to apply. We report here the saturation of the genomic map of rye with additional microsatellite-derived markers that we obtained from the rye expressed sequence tag (EST) databases and the Gatersleben collection of wheat microsatellite markers (WMS). A total of 99 loci (39 EST and 60 WMS) were mapped into the RFLP frameworks of four rye mapping populations consisting of 139, 64, 58 and 60 RFLPs, respectively. For another ten WMS loci, which amplified PCR products not polymorphic in any of the mapping populations, chromosome and chromosome arm locations were determined using wheat-rye addition lines. Chromosomes 1R, 2R, 3R, 4R, 5R, 6R and 7R were enriched with 9, 19, 9, 13, 27, 16 and 16 microsatellite loci, respectively. The microsatellite loci mapped were evenly distributed along the chromosomes, which is important for the further application of these markers for gene mapping or diversity studies in rye. Forty-four of the WMS loci mapped in rye were found to be homologous to those mapped in bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)."

"16682748","abstracttext","The brittle rachis character, which causes spontaneous shattering of spikelets, has an adaptive value in wild grass species. The loci Br1 and Br2 in durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) and Br3 in hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum L.) determine disarticulation of rachides above the junction of the rachilla with the rachis such that a fragment of rachis is attached below each spikelet. Using microsatellite markers, the loci Br1, Br2 and Br3 were mapped on the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. The Br2 locus was located on the short arm of chromosome 3A and linked with the centromeric marker, Xgwm32, at a distance of 13.3 cM. The Br3 locus was located on the short arm of chromosome 3B and linked with the centromeric marker, Xgwm72 (at a distance of 14.2 cM). The Br1 locus was located on the short arm of chromosome 3D. The distance of Br1 from the centromeric marker Xgdm72 was 25.3 cM. Mapping the Br1, Br2 and Br3 loci of the brittle rachis suggests the homoeologous origin of these 3 loci for brittle rachides. Since the genes for brittle rachis have been retained in the gene pool of durum wheat, the more closely linked markers with the brittle rachis locus are required to select against brittle rachis genotypes and then to avoid yield loss in improved cultivars."

"18956025","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiormis Westend f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Stripe rust resistance genes Yr27, Yr31, YrSp, YrV23, and YrCN19 on chromosome 2BS confer resistance to some or all Chinese P. striiormis f. sp. tritici races CYR31, CYR32, SY11-4, and SY11-14 in the greenhouse. To screen microsatellite (SSR) markers linked with YrCN19, F1, F2, and F3 populations derived from cross Ch377/CN19 were screened with race CYR32 and 35 SSR primer pairs. Linkage analysis indicated that the single dominant gene YrCN19 in cultivar CN19 was linked with SSR markers Xgwm410, Xgwm374, Xwmc477, and Xgwm382 on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 0.3, 7.9, 12.3, and 21.2 cM, respectively. Crosses of CN19 with wheat lines carrying other genes on chromosome 2B showed that all were located at different loci. YrCN19 is thus different from the other reported Yr genes in chromosomal location and resistance response and was therefore named Yr41. Prospects and strategies of using Yr41 and other Yr genes in wheat improvement for stripe rust resistance are discussed."

"16663633","abstracttext","The amount of pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) (EC 2.7.9.1) protein in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var Cheyenne) grains was determined at different stages of development by the protein blot method. The variation in PPDK protein with time in developing wheat grains was similar to that of the enzyme's activity reported by Meyer et al. (1982 Plant Physiol 69: 7-10). The variation in levels of PPDK mRNA with seed development was determined by analysis of polypeptides immunoprecipitated by anti-PPDK serum from in vitro translation products of extracted seed RNA. This mRNA variation was similar to that of the in vivo enzyme levels and the correlation is consistent with the regulation of PPDK gene expression by the level of its mRNA.The highest level of PPDK in developing wheat seeds occurs later than the highest levels of both ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.39) and of chlorophyll, which are located in the green pericarp tissue. PPDK was located in both endosperm and pericarp tissue of the seeds. The tissue location and developmental profile of seed PPDK are consistent with a metabolic role of providing phosphoenolpyruvate as a substrate for recapturing respiratory CO(2) in the seed, and possibly for amino acid interconversions during development."

"20028842","abstracttext","Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread soil pollutant; thus, the underlying molecular controls of plant Cd tolerance are of substantial interest. A screen for wheat (Triticum aestivum) genes that confer Cd tolerance to a Cd hypersensitive yeast strain identified Heat shock transcription factor A4a (HsfA4a). Ta HsfA4a is most similar to the class A4 Hsfs from monocots. The most closely related rice (Oryza sativa) homolog, Os HsfA4a, conferred Cd tolerance in yeast, as did Ta HsfA4a, but the second most closely related rice homolog, Os HsfA4d, did not. Cd tolerance was enhanced in rice plants expressing Ta HsfA4a and decreased in rice plants with knocked-down expression of Os HsfA4a. An analysis of the functional domain using chimeric proteins constructed from Ta HsfA4a and Os HsfA4d revealed that the DNA binding domain (DBD) of HsfA4a is critical for Cd tolerance, and within the DBD, Ala-31 and Leu-42 are important for Cd tolerance. Moreover, Ta HsfA4a-mediated Cd resistance in yeast requires metallothionein (MT). In the roots of wheat and rice, Cd stress caused increases in HsfA4a expression, together the MT genes. Our findings thus suggest that HsfA4a of wheat and rice confers Cd tolerance by upregulating MT gene expression in planta."

"20568641","abstracttext","The Russian wheat aphid, Diruaphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is globally one of the most devastating pests of bread wheat, Tritium aestivum L.; durum wheat, Triticum turgidum L.; and barley, Hordeum vulgare L. Host plant resistance is the foundation for cereal insect pest management programs, and several sources of D. noxia resistance have been incorporated in cultivars to manage D. noxia damage. The emergence of D. noxia North American biotype 2 (RWA2) in Colorado has made all known Dn genes vulnerable except the Dn7 gene from rye, Secale cereale, and has warranted exploration for sources of resistance to both RWA1 and RWA2. The category of resistance in resistant donor plants may exert selection pressure over the aphid population to form a new virulent population. In the current study, we report tolerance and antibiosis resistance to RWA1 and RWA2 in the barley genotype 'Stoneham'. The rate and degree of expression of resistance in Stoneham against RWA1 and RWA2, although not similar, are greater than the partial resistance in 'Sidney'. Antixenosis resistance to RWA1 or RWA2 was not observed in Sidney or Stoneham. The tolerance identified in Stoneham is encouraging because it may delay D. noxia biotype selection and fits well in a dryland barley cropping system."

"19615785","abstracttext","Total glutathione S-transferase (GST, EC 2.5.1.18) and glutathione peroxidase (GPOX) activity were measured spectrophotometrically in Triticum aestivum cv. MV Emese and cv. Plainsman (drought tolerant) and cv. GK Elet and Cappelle Desprez (drought-sensitive) flag leaves under control and drought stress conditions during the grain-filling period, in order to reveal possible roles of different GST classes in the senescence of flag leaves. Six wheat GSTs, members of 3 GST classes, were selected and their regulation by drought and senescence was investigated. High GPOX activity (EC 1.11.1.9) was observed in well-watered controls of the drought-tolerant Plainsman cultivar. At the same time, TaGSTU1B and TaGSTF6 sequences, investigated by real-time PCR, showed high-expression levels that increased with time, indicating that the gene products of these genes may play important roles in monocarpic senescence of wheat. Expression of these genes was also induced by drought stress in all of the four investigated cultivars, but extremely high transcript amounts were detected in cv. Plainsman. Our data indicate genotypic variations of wheat GSTs. Expression levels and early induction of two senescence-associated GSTs under drought during grain filling in flag leaves correlated with high yield stability."

"19858116","abstracttext","The NAM-B1 gene is a NAC transcription factor that affects grain nutrient concentrations in wheat (Triticum aestivum). An RNAi line with reduced expression of NAM genes has lower grain protein, iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) concentrations. To determine whether decreased remobilization, lower plant uptake, or decreased partitioning to grain are responsible for this phenotype, mineral dynamics were quantified in wheat tissues throughout grain development. Control and RNAi wheat were grown in potting mix and hydroponics. Mineral (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P, S, and Zn) and nitrogen (N) contents of organs were determined at regular intervals to quantify the net remobilization from vegetative tissues and the accumulation of nutrients in grain. Total nutrient accumulation was similar between lines, but grain Fe, Zn, and N were at lower concentrations in the NAM knockdown line. In potting mix, net remobilization of N, Fe, and Zn from vegetative tissues was impaired in the RNAi line. In hydroponics with ample nutrients, net remobilization was not observed, but grain Fe and Zn contents and concentrations remained lower in the RNAi line. When Fe or Zn was withheld post-anthesis, both lines demonstrated remobilization. These results suggest that a major effect of the NAM genes is an increased efflux of nutrients from the vegetative tissues and a higher partitioning of nutrients to grain."

"22642366","abstracttext","We found significant genetic variation in the ability of wheat (Triticum aestivum) to form rhizosheaths on acid soil and assessed whether differences in aluminium (Al(3+) ) tolerance of root hairs between genotypes was the physiological basis for this genetic variation. A method was developed to rapidly screen rhizosheath size in a range of wheat genotypes. Backcrossed populations were generated from cv Fronteira (large rhizosheath) using cv EGA-Burke (small rhizosheath) as the recurrent parent. A positive correlation existed between rhizosheath size on acid soil and root hair length. In hydroponic experiments, root hairs of the backcrossed lines with large rhizosheaths were more tolerant of Al(3+) toxicity than the backcrossed lines with small rhizosheaths. We conclude that greater Al(3+) tolerance of root hairs underlies the larger rhizosheath of wheat grown on acid soil. Tolerance of the root hairs to Al(3+) was largely independent of the TaALMT1 gene which suggests that different genes encode the Al(3+) tolerance of root hairs. The maintenance of longer root hairs in acid soils is important for the efficient uptake of water and nutrients."

"20723133","abstracttext","Anther culture-derived haploid embryos were used as explants for Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv CPAN1676) using barley HVA1 gene for drought tolerance. Regenerated plantlets were checked for transgene integration in T₀ generation, and positive transgenic haploid plants were doubled by colchicine treatment. Stable transgenic doubled haploid plants were obtained, and transgene expression was monitored till T₄ generation, and no transgene silencing was observed over the generations. Doubled haploid transgenic plants have faster seed germination and seedling establishment and show better drought tolerance in comparison with nontransgenic, doubled haploid plants, as measured by per cent germination, seedling growth and biomass accumulation. Physiological evaluation for abiotic stress by assessing nitrate reductase enzyme activity and plant yield under post-anthesis water limitation revealed a better tolerance of the transgenics over the wild type. This is the first report on the production of double haploid transgenic wheat through anther culture technique in a commercial cultivar for a desirable trait. This method would also be useful in functional genomics of wheat and other allopolyploids of agronomic importance."

"21356002","abstracttext","The genome of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) is predicted to be greater than 16 Gbp in size and consist predominantly of repetitive elements, making the sequencing and assembly of this genome a major challenge. We have reduced genome sequence complexity by isolating chromosome arm 7DS and applied second-generation technology and appropriate algorithmic analysis to sequence and assemble low copy and genic regions of this chromosome arm. The assembly represents approximately 40% of the chromosome arm and all known 7DS genes. Comparison of the 7DS assembly with the sequenced genomes of rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium distachyon identified large regions of conservation. The syntenic relationship between wheat, B. distachyon and O. sativa, along with available genetic mapping data, has been used to produce an annotated draft 7DS syntenic build, which is publicly available at http://www.wheatgenome.info. Our results suggest that the sequencing of isolated chromosome arms can provide valuable information of the gene content of wheat and is a step towards whole-genome sequencing and variation discovery in this important crop."

"23641187","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting, the germination of mature seeds on the mother plant under moist condition, is a serious problem in cereals. To investigate the effect of reduced abscisic acid (ABA) catabolism on germination in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we cloned the wheat ABA 8'-hydroxyase gene which was highly expressed during seed development (TaABA8'OH1) and screened for mutations that lead to reduced ABA catabolism. In a screen for natural variation, one insertion mutation in exon 5 of TaABA8'OH1 on the D genome (TaABA8'OH1-D) was identified in Japanese cultivars including 'Tamaizumi'. However, a single mutation in TaABA8'OH1-D had no clear effect on germination inhibition in double haploid lines. In a screen for a mutation, one deletion mutant lacking the entire TaABA8'OH1 on the A genome (TaABA8'OH1-A), TM1833, was identified from gamma-ray irradiation lines of 'Tamaizumi'. TM1833 (a double mutant in TaABA8'OH1-A and TaABA8'OH1-D) showed lower TaABA8'OH1 expression, higher ABA content in embryos during seed development under field condition and lower germination than those in 'Tamaizumi' (a single mutant in TaABA8'OH1-D). These results indicate that reduced ABA catabolism through mutations in TaABA8'OH1 may be effective in germination inhibition in field-grown wheat."

"23872742","abstracttext","Alginate oligosaccharides (AOS), which are marine oligosaccharides, are involved in regulating plant root growth, but the promotion mechanism for AOS remains unclear. Here, AOS (10-80 mg L(-1)) were found to induce the generation of nitric oxide (NO) in the root system of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which promoted the formation and elongation of wheat roots in a dose-dependent manner. NO inhibitors suggested that nitrate reductase (NR), rather than nitric oxide synthase (NOS), was essential for AOS-induced root development. Further studies confirmed that AOS-induced NO generation in wheat roots by up-regulating the gene expression and enzyme activity of NR at the post-transcriptional level. The anatomy and RT-PCR results showed that AOS accelerated the division and growth of stele cells, leading to an increase in the ratio of stele area to root transverse area. This could be inhibited by the NR inhibitor, sodium tungstate, which indicated that NO catalyzed by the NR was involved in AOS regulation of root development. Taken together, in the early stage of AOS-induced root development, NO generation was a novel mechanism by which AOS regulated plant growth. The results also showed that this marine resource could be widely used for crop development."

"23782173","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum and Pyrenophora tritici-repentis produce the effector ToxA that interacts with the dominant susceptibility gene in wheat, Tsn1. However, the way in which ToxA induces cell death and causes disease is unclear. Here, we performed comprehensive metabolite profiling of ToxA-infiltrated wheat (Triticum aestivum) to observe the secondary metabolite response to this effector. A strong induction of secondary metabolism subsequent to SnToxA infiltration was observed, including the monoamine serotonin. We established a novel role for serotonin as a phytoalexin in wheat and demonstrated that serotonin strongly inhibited sporulation of S. nodorum. Microscopy revealed that serotonin interferes with spore formation and maturation within pycnidial structures of the fungus. Subsequent analysis of S. nodorum exposed to serotonin revealed metabolites changes previously associated with sporulation, including trehalose and alternariol. Furthermore, we identified significantly lower concentrations of serotonin during infection compared with infiltration with ToxA, providing evidence that S. nodorum may suppress plant defence. This is the first study demonstrating induction of plant secondary metabolites in response to a necrotrophic effector that have significant antifungal potential against the pathogen. While it is generally accepted that necrotrophs exploit host cell responses, the current research strengthens the notion that necrotrophs require mechanisms to overcome plant defence to survive initial stages of infection."

"23529204","abstracttext","Stripe rust is a devastating fungal disease of wheat worldwide which is primarily caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp tritici. Transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) expressing rice class chitinase gene RC24 were developed by particle bombardment of immature embryos and tested for resistance to Puccinia striiformis f.sp tritici. under greenhouse and field conditions. Putative transformants were selected on kanamycin-containing media. Polymease chain reaction indicated that RC24 was transferred into 17 transformants obtained from bombardment of 1,684 immature embryos. Integration of RC24 was confirmed by Southern blot with a RC24-labeled probe and expression of RC24 was verified by RT-PCR. Nine transgenic T1 lines exhibited enhanced resistance to stripe rust infection with lines XN8 and BF4 showing the highest level of resistance. Southern blot hybridization confirmed the stable inheritance of RC24 in transgenic T1 plants. Resistance to stripe rust in transgenic T2 and T3 XN8 and BF4 plants was confirmed over two consecutive years in the field. Increased yield (27-36 %) was recorded for transgenic T2 and T3 XN8 and BF4 plants compared to controls. These results suggest that rice class I chitinase RC24 can be used to engineer stripe rust resistance in wheat."

"24326670","abstracttext","One of the two branches of the α-linolenic acid metabolism pathway is catalyzed by 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase I, and the other is involved in jasmonic acid (JA) synthesis. The former is known to be active in the response to salinity tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum), but the participation of the latter in this response has not been established as yet. Here, the salinity-responsive bread wheat gene TaAOC1, which encodes an allene oxide cyclase involved in the α-linolenic acid metabolism pathway, was constitutively expressed in both bread wheat and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In both species, transgenic lines exhibited an enhanced level of tolerance to salinity. The transgenic plants accumulated a higher content of JA and developed shorter roots. Both the shortened roots and the salinity tolerance were abolished in a background lacking a functional AtMYC2, a key component of the JA and abscisic acid signaling pathway, but were still expressed in a background deficient with respect to abscisic acid synthesis. We provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, suggesting that JA is also involved in the plant salinity response and that the α-linolenic acid metabolism pathway has a regulatory role over this response."

"26305210","abstracttext","Heat stress poses a serious threat to global crop production. In efforts that aim to mitigate the adverse effects of heat stress on crops, a variety of genetic tools are being used to develop plants with improved thermotolerance. The characterization of important regulators of heat stress tolerance provides essential information for this aim. In this study, we examine the wheat (Triticum aestivum) NAC transcription factor gene TaNAC2L. High temperature induced TaNAC2L expression in wheat and overexpression of TaNAC2L in Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced acquired heat tolerance without causing obvious alterations in phenotype compared with wild type under normal conditions. TaNAC2L overexpression also activated the expression of heat-related genes in the transgenic Arabidopsis plants, suggesting that TaNAC2L may improve heat tolerance by regulating the expression of stress-responsive genes. Notably, TaNAC2L is also regulated at the post-translational level and might be degraded via a proteasome-mediated pathway. Thus, this wheat transcription factor may have potential uses in enhancing thermotolerance in crops."
"26371233","articletitle","The Nitrate-Inducible NAC Transcription Factor TaNAC2-5A Controls Nitrate Response and Increases Wheat Yield."
"26371233","abstracttext","Nitrate is a major nitrogen resource for cereal crops; thus, understanding nitrate signaling in cereal crops is valuable for engineering crops with improved nitrogen use efficiency. Although several regulators have been identified in nitrate sensing and signaling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), the equivalent information in cereals is missing. Here, we isolated a nitrate-inducible and cereal-specific NAM, ATAF, and CUC (NAC) transcription factor, TaNAC2-5A, from wheat (Triticum aestivum). A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that TaNAC2-5A could directly bind to the promoter regions of the genes encoding nitrate transporter and glutamine synthetase. Overexpression of TaNAC2-5A in wheat enhanced root growth and nitrate influx rate and, hence, increased the root's ability to acquire nitrogen. Furthermore, we found that TaNAC2-5A-overexpressing transgenic wheat lines had higher grain yield and higher nitrogen accumulation in aerial parts and allocated more nitrogen in grains in a field experiment. These results suggest that TaNAC2-5A is involved in nitrate signaling and show that it is an exciting gene resource for breeding crops with more efficient use of fertilizer."

"26394305","abstracttext","Although wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) pericarp starch granule (PSG) has been well-studied, our knowledge of its features and mechanism of accumulation and degradation during pericarp growth is poor. In the present study, developing wheat caryopses were collected and starch granules were extracted from their pericarp to investigate the morphological and structural characteristics of PSGs using microscopy, X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy techniques. Relative gene expression levels of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (APGase), granule-bound starch synthase II (GBSS II), and α-amylase (AMY) were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. PSGs presented as single or multiple starch granules and were synthesized both in the amyloplast and chloroplast in the pericarp. PSG degradation occurred in the mesocarp, beginning at 6 days after anthesis. Amylose contents in PSGs were lower and relative degrees of crystallinity were higher at later stages of development than at earlier stages. Short-range ordered structures in the external regions of PSGs showed no differences in the developing pericarp. When hydrolyzed by α-amylase, PSGs at various developmental stages showed high degrees of enzymolysis. Expression levels of AGPase, GBSS II, and AMY were closely related to starch synthesis and degradation. These results help elucidate the mechanisms of accumulation and degradation as well as the functions of PSG during wheat caryopsis development."

"25545326","abstracttext","Increasing the duration of leaf photosynthesis during grain filling using slow-senescing functional stay-green phenotypes is a possible route for increasing grain yields in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, delayed senescence may negatively affect nutrient remobilisation and hence reduce grain protein concentrations and grain quality. A novel NAC1-type transcription factor (hereafter TaNAC-S) was identified in wheat, with gene expression located primarily in leaf/sheath tissues, which decreased during post-anthesis leaf senescence. Expression of TaNAC-S in the second leaf correlated with delayed senescence in two doubled-haploid lines of an Avalon × Cadenza population (lines 112 and 181), which were distinct for leaf senescence. Transgenic wheat plants overexpressing TaNAC-S resulted in delayed leaf senescence (stay-green phenotype). Grain yield, aboveground biomass, harvest index and total grain N content were unaffected, but NAC over-expressing lines had higher grain N concentrations at similar grain yields compared to non-transgenic controls. These results indicate that TaNAC-S is a negative regulator of leaf senescence, and that delayed leaf senescence may lead not only to increased grain yields but also to increased grain protein concentrations."

"25475983","abstracttext","In this study, the effect of heat and chromium (Cr) heavy metal interactions on wheat seedlings (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Ç-1252 and Gun91) was investigated by measuring total chlorophyll and carotenoid levels, catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) antioxidant enzyme activities, and MYB73, ERF1 and TaSRG gene expression. Examination of pigment levels demonstrated a decrease in total chlorophyll in both species of wheat under combined heat and heavy metal stress, while the carotenoid levels showed a slight increase. APX activity increased in both species in response to heavy metal stress, but the increase in APX activity in the Gun91 seedlings was higher than that in the Ç-1252 seedlings. CAT activity increased in Gun91 seedlings but decreased in Ç-1252 seedlings. These results showed that Gun91 seedling had higher resistance to Cr and Cr + heat stresses than the Ç-1252 seedling. The quantitative molecular analyses implied that the higher resistance was related to the overexpression of TaMYB73, TaERF1 and TaSRG transcription factors. The increase in the expression levels of these transcription factors was profound under combined Cr and heat stress. This study suggests that TaMYB73, TaERF1 and TaSRG transcription factors regulate Cr and heat stress responsive genes in wheat."

We describe the creation and validation of an eight-parent MAGIC population consisting of 1091 F7 lines of winter-sown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Analyses based on genotypes from a 90,000-single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array find the population to be well-suited as a platform for fine-mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) and gene isolation. Patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) show the population to be highly recombined; genetic marker diversity among the founders was 74% of that captured in a larger set of 64 wheat varieties, and 54% of SNPs segregating among the 64 lines also segregated among the eight founder lines. In contrast, a commonly used reference bi-parental population had only 54% of the diversity of the 64 varieties with 27% of SNPs segregating. We demonstrate the potential of this MAGIC resource by identifying a highly diagnostic marker for the morphological character ""awn presence/absence"" and independently validate it in an association-mapping panel. These analyses show this large, diverse, and highly recombined MAGIC population to be a powerful resource for the genetic dissection of target traits in wheat, and it is well-placed to efficiently exploit ongoing advances in phenomics and genomics.

"25931984","abstracttext","In the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar 'Zenkoujikomugi', a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter of MOTHER OF FT AND TFL1 on chromosome 3A (MFT-3A) causes an increase in the level of gene expression, resulting in strong grain dormancy. We used a DNA marker to detect the 'Zenkoujikomugi'-type (Zen-type) SNP and examined the genotype of MFT-3A in Japanese wheat varieties, and we found that 169 of 324 varieties carry the Zen-type SNP. In Japanese commercial varieties, the frequency of the Zen-type SNP was remarkably high in the southern part of Japan, but low in the northern part. To examine the relationship between MFT-3A genotype and grain dormancy, we performed a germination assay in three wheat-growing seasons. On average, the varieties carrying the Zen-type SNP showed stronger grain dormancy than the varieties carrying the non-Zen-type SNP. Among commercial cultivars, 'Iwainodaichi' (Kyushu), 'Junreikomugi' (Kinki-Chugoku-Shikoku), 'Kinuhime' (Kanto-Tokai), 'Nebarigoshi' (Tohoku-Hokuriku), and 'Kitamoe' (Hokkaido) showed the strongest grain dormancy in each geographical group, and all these varieties, except for 'Kitamoe', were found to carry the Zen-type SNP. In recent years, the number of varieties carrying the Zen-type SNP has increased in the Tohoku-Hokuriku region, but not in the Hokkaido region."

"26854409","abstracttext","Young wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Mv Béres) were exposed to 0 or 25 mM NaCl for 11 days (salt acclimation). Thereafter the plants were irrigated with 500 mM NaCl for 5 days (salt stress). Irrigating the plants with a low concentration of NaCl successfully led to a reduction in chlorotic symptoms and in the impairment of the photosynthetic processes when the plants were exposed to subsequent high-dose salt treatment. After exposure to a high concentration of NaCl there was no difference in leaf Na content between the salt-acclimated and non-acclimated plants, indicating that salt acclimation did not significantly modify Na transport to the shoots. While the polyamine level was lower in salt-treated plants than in the control, salt acclimation led to increased osmotic potential in the leaves. Similarly, the activities of certain antioxidant enzymes, namely glutathione reductase, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase, were significantly higher in salt-acclimated plants. The results also suggest that while SOS1, SOS2 or NHX2 do not play a decisive role in the salt acclimation processes in young wheat plants; another stress-related gene, WALI6, may contribute to the success of the salt acclimation processes. The present study suggested that the responses of wheat plants to acclimation with low level of salt and to treatment with high doses of salt may be fundamentally different."
"27155533","articletitle","Identification and molecular characterization of the nicotianamine synthase gene family in bread wheat."
"27155533","abstracttext","Nicotianamine (NA) is a non-protein amino acid involved in fundamental aspects of metal uptake, transport and homeostasis in all plants and constitutes the biosynthetic precursor of mugineic acid family phytosiderophores (MAs) in graminaceous plant species. Nicotianamine synthase (NAS) genes, which encode enzymes that synthesize NA from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM), are differentially regulated by iron (Fe) status in most plant species and plant genomes have been found to contain anywhere from 1 to 9 NAS genes. This study describes the identification of 21 NAS genes in the hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genome and their phylogenetic classification into two distinct clades. The TaNAS genes are highly expressed during germination, seedling growth and reproductive development. Fourteen of the clade I NAS genes were up-regulated in root tissues under conditions of Fe deficiency. Protein sequence analyses revealed the presence of endocytosis motifs in all of the wheat NAS proteins as well as chloroplast, mitochondrial and secretory transit peptide signals in four proteins. These results greatly expand our knowledge of NAS gene families in graminaceous plant species as well as the genetics underlying Fe nutrition in bread wheat."

"27393991","abstracttext","Pectin methyl esterase (PME) genes code for enzymes that are involved in structural modifications of the plant cell wall during plant growth and development. They are also involved in plant-pathogen interaction. PME genes belong to a multigene family and in this study we report the first comprehensive analysis of the PME gene family in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Like in other species, the members of the TaPME family are dispersed throughout the genome and their encoded products retain the typical structural features of PMEs. qRT-PCR analysis showed variation in the expression pattern of TaPME genes in different tissues and revealed that these genes are mainly expressed in flowering spikes. In our attempt to identify putative TaPME genes involved in wheat defense, we revealed a strong variation in the expression of the TaPME following Fusarium graminearum infection, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB). Particularly interesting was the finding that the expression profile of some PME genes was markedly different between the FHB-resistant wheat cultivar Sumai3 and the FHB-susceptible cultivar Bobwhite, suggesting a possible involvement of these PME genes in FHB resistance. Moreover, the expression analysis of the TaPME genes during F. graminearum progression within the spike revealed those genes that responded more promptly to pathogen invasion."

"29143815","abstracttext","Aegilops tauschii is the diploid progenitor of the D genome of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum, genomes AABBDD) and an important genetic resource for wheat. The large size and highly repetitive nature of the Ae. tauschii genome has until now precluded the development of a reference-quality genome sequence. Here we use an array of advanced technologies, including ordered-clone genome sequencing, whole-genome shotgun sequencing, and BioNano optical genome mapping, to generate a reference-quality genome sequence for Ae. tauschii ssp. strangulata accession AL8/78, which is closely related to the wheat D genome. We show that compared to other sequenced plant genomes, including a much larger conifer genome, the Ae. tauschii genome contains unprecedented amounts of very similar repeated sequences. Our genome comparisons reveal that the Ae. tauschii genome has a greater number of dispersed duplicated genes than other sequenced genomes and its chromosomes have been structurally evolving an order of magnitude faster than those of other grass genomes. The decay of colinearity with other grass genomes correlates with recombination rates along chromosomes. We propose that the vast amounts of very similar repeated sequences cause frequent errors in recombination and lead to gene duplications and structural chromosome changes that drive fast genome evolution."

"28684433","abstracttext","Increasing the intrinsic nutritional quality of crops, known as biofortification, is viewed as a sustainable approach to alleviate micronutrient deficiencies. In particular, iron deficiency anemia is a major global health issue, but the iron content of staple crops such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) is difficult to change because of genetic complexity and homeostasis mechanisms. To identify target genes for the biofortification of wheat, we functionally characterized homologs of the VACUOLAR IRON TRANSPORTER ( VIT ). The wheat genome contains two VIT paralogs, TaVIT1 and TaVIT2 , which have different expression patterns but are both low in the endosperm. TaVIT2, but not TaVIT1, was able to rescue the growth of a yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae ) mutant defective in vacuolar iron transport. TaVIT2 also complemented a manganese transporter mutant but not a vacuolar zinc transporter mutant. By overexpressing TaVIT2 under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, we achieved a greater than 2-fold increase in iron in white flour fractions, exceeding minimum legal fortification levels in countries such as the United Kingdom. The antinutrient phytate was not increased and the iron in the white flour fraction was bioavailable in vitro, suggesting that food products made from the biofortified flour could contribute to improved iron nutrition. The single-gene approach impacted minimally on plant growth and also was effective in barley ( Hordeum vulgare ). Our results show that by enhancing vacuolar iron transport in the endosperm, this essential micronutrient accumulated in this tissue, bypassing existing homeostatic mechanisms."

"27717465","abstracttext","Drought stress is a major factor limiting wheat growth and productivity. Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are tolerant to water-related stress. To reveal the regulatory mechanisms of LEA proteins under drought stress, we cloned a novel group 3 LEA gene, namely, TaDlea3, from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Shaanhe 6. Subcellular localization assay showed that TaDlea3 protein accumulated in the cytoplasm. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results revealed that TaDlea3 expression was induced by drought stress. Western blot results indicated that TaDlea3 protein expression gradually increased with drought stress during four different developmental stages. Under normal conditions, no obvious phenotype difference was observed between the transgenic and wild-type seedlings. Meanwhile, the overexpression of TaDlea3 in Arabidopsis resulted in enhanced tolerance to drought stress, as determined by the assessment of antioxidant enzyme activities. Our results provide a basis for highly detailed functional analyses of LEA proteins and offer a promising approach for improving the tolerances of wheat cultivars to drought stress through genetic engineering."

"29444813","abstracttext","The flowers of major cereals are arranged on reproductive branches known as spikelets, which group together to form an inflorescence. Diversity for inflorescence architecture has been exploited during domestication to increase crop yields, and genetic variation for this trait has potential to further boost grain production. Multiple genes that regulate inflorescence architecture have been identified by studying alleles that modify gene activity or dosage; however, little is known in wheat. Here, we show TEOSINTE BRANCHED1 ( TB1 ) regulates inflorescence architecture in bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) by investigating lines that display a form of inflorescence branching known as ""paired spikelets."" We show that TB1 interacts with FLOWERING LOCUS T1 and that increased dosage of TB1 alters inflorescence architecture and growth rate in a process that includes reduced expression of meristem identity genes, with allelic diversity for TB1 found to associate genetically with paired spikelet development in modern cultivars. We propose TB1 coordinates formation of axillary spikelets during the vegetative to floral transition and that alleles known to modify dosage or function of TB1 could help increase wheat yields."
"29089392","articletitle","The E3 Ligase TaSAP5 Alters Drought Stress Responses by Promoting the Degradation of DRIP Proteins."
"29089392","abstracttext","In Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) plants growing under normal conditions, DEHYDRATION-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT BINDING PROTEIN2A (DREB2A) is present at low levels because it is ubiquitinated and destabilized by DREB2A INTERACTING PROTEIN1 (DRIP1) and DRIP2 through 26S proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Drought stress counteracts the ubiquitination and proteolysis of DREB2A, thus allowing the accumulation of sufficient amounts of DREB2A protein to activate downstream gene expression. The mechanisms leading to drought stress-mediated DREB2A accumulation are still unclear. Here, we report that the wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) TaSAP5 protein, which contains an A20/AN1 domain, acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to mediate DRIP degradation and thus increase DREB2A protein levels. Drought induces TaSAP5 expression in wheat, and TaSAP5 overexpression in Arabidopsis and wheat seedlings increased their drought tolerance, as measured by survival rate and grain yield under severe drought stress. TaSAP5 can interact with and ubiquitinate TaDRIP, as well as AtDRIP1 and AtDRIP2, leading to their subsequent degradation through the 26S proteasome pathway. Consistent with this, TaSAP5 overexpression enhances DRIP degradation and increases the levels of DREB2A protein and its downstream targets. These results suggest that TaSAP5 acts to link drought with DREB2A accumulation and illustrate the molecular mechanisms involved in this process."

In this study, the genetic variability of elite spring wheat germplasm from North America was investigated to characterize the genetic basis of effective all-stage and adult plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust. A genome-wide association study was conducted using 237 elite spring wheat lines genotyped with an Illumina Infinium 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism array. All-stage resistance was evaluated at seedling stage in controlled conditions and field evaluations were conducted under natural disease pressure in eight environments across Washington State. High heritability estimates and correlations between infection type and severity were observed. Ten loci for race-specific all-stage resistance were confirmed from previous mapping studies. Three potentially new loci associated with race-specific all-stage resistance were identified on chromosomes 1D, 2A, and 5A. For APR, 11 highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) (false discovery rate < 0.01) were identified, of which 3 QTL on chromosomes 3A, 5D, and 7A are reported for the first time. The QTL identified in this study can be used to enrich the current gene pool and improve the diversity of resistance to stripe rust disease."

"30804648","abstracttext","Bainong male sterile (BNS) wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is a thermo-sensitive genic male sterile line with excellent sterility and self-restoration. We focused on transcriptional profiles of differentially expressed probes between BNS sterile and fertile anthers. Anthers, rachis and spikes from sterile line and fertile line were collected. Extracted RNA was assayed using wheat expression microarray and Gene Ontology was analyzed using Cytoscape with ClueGO. An indole (indole-3-acetic acid: IAA) metabolism pathway sub-network was almost formed in all differentially expressed profiles between sterile and fertile samples. IAA sub-network contained four nodes of indole and alkaloid metabolism connecting main network via indole compounds. This sub-network was absent in rachis and intact in transformed fertile anthers, which was the main differently expressed metabolism pathway in F 1 anthers with restorer genes. Alkaloid metabolism was absent in sterile anthers. Abnormal metabolism of IAA may be involved in BNS sterility. BNS transformation may be regulated by the production of IAA and alkaloid metabolism pathway, which favor the safe utilization of the sterile line in hybrid wheat production."

A virulent leaf rust race 77-5 was used for inoculation of resistant (HD2329+Lr28) and susceptible (HD2329 - Lr28) wheat NILs and cDNA-AFLP analyses was carried out. As many as 223 differential transcripts appeared following leaf rust inoculation; these included 122 transcripts that appeared exclusively in resistant NIL, whereas 39 transcripts appeared both in resistant and susceptible NILs. Sequence analyses of 37 transcripts, which appeared in the resistant NIL revealed that 15 transcripts had homology with genes involved in protein synthesis, signal transduction, transport, disease resistance and metabolism. The functions of remaining 22 transcripts could not be determined; these included six novel genes reported for the first time in wheat. Specific primers could be designed for 18 of the 37 transcripts, which included genes with putative and unknown functions. Quantitative real time PCR analysis was conducted using these 18 pairs of primers. A majority (13) of these transcripts appeared within 48h reaching a peak value at 96h in resistant NIL signifying their role in providing leaf rust resistance."

The CIMMYT bread wheat line Saar has exhibited a high level of partial resistance to powdery mildew in field trials conducted in Europe, Asia, and South America, and represents a valuable source of resistance in wheat breeding. A set of 114 random F 5 inbred lines from the cross Saar × Avocet-YrA (susceptible) were evaluated in replicated field trials at two locations in southeastern Norway to determine the number of genes involved in partial resistance to powdery mildew. Narrow-sense heritability estimates were high (0.83 to 0.92). Based on both quantitative and qualitative genetic analyses, the minimum number of genes with additive effects segregating for powdery mildew resistance in the population was four. Transgressive segregation indicated that Avocet-YrA might have contributed one minor gene for resistance. It is concluded that partial resistance to powdery mildew in Saar is controlled by at least three genes. Such resistance conferred by multiple genes having additive effects is expected to be durable."

"31937682","abstracttext","Nitrate is the preferred form of nitrogen for most plants, acting both as a nutrient and a signaling molecule. However, the components and regulatory factors governing nitrate uptake in bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), one of the world's most important crop species, have remained unclear, largely due to the complexity of its hexaploid genome. Here, based on recently released whole-genome information for bread wheat, the high-affinity nitrate transporter2 ( NRT2 ) and the nitrate-assimilation-related ( NAR ) gene family are characterized. We show that abscisic acid (ABA)- Glc ester deconjugation is stimulated in bread wheat roots by nitrate resupply following nitrate withdrawal, leading to enhanced root-tissue ABA accumulation, and that this enhancement, in turn, affects the expression of root-type NRT2 / NAR genes. TaANR1 is shown to regulate nitrate-mediated ABA accumulation by directly activating TaBG1 , while TaWabi5 is involved in ABA-mediated NO 3 - induction of NRT2 / NAR genes. Building on previous evidence establishing ABA involvement in the developmental response to high-nitrate stress, our study suggests that ABA also contributes to the optimization of nitrate uptake by regulating the expression of NRT2 / NAR genes under limited nitrate supply, offering a new target for improvement of nitrate absorption in crops."

"31481230","abstracttext","During the grain filling stage, high light (HL) usually results in premature leaf senescence and significant yield loss in wheat. To explore the responses of sugar metabolism and the association of sugar accumulation and leaf senescence in HL, the activity and gene expression of sugar metabolism-related enzymes were analyzed when two wheat cultivars Triticum aestivum L. Xiaoyan 54 (XY54, HL tolerant) and Jing 411 (J411, HL sensitive) were transferred from low light (LL) to HL for 28 d. The results showed that the CO 2 assimilation rate, quantity of Rubisco and chlorophyll binding proteins decreased substantially for both cultivars in HL. However, the content of fructose, sucrose, and starch increased dramatically. In addition, the activity of hexokinase, pyruvate kinase, sucrose phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, and alkaline/neutral invertase increased significantly while the expression of most of the sugar metabolism-related genes were repressed by long-term HL. Correlation analysis revealed that sugar content and sucrose phosphate synthase activity were negatively while the expression of most sugar metabolism-related genes were positively correlated with chlorophyll content during HL treatment. Comparatively, the HL tolerant cultivar XY54 accumulated less sugars than the HL sensitive cultivar J411, suggesting that sugar metabolism may be the regulation target for wheat improvement to cope with HL stress."

"32959463","abstracttext","Serendipita vermifera ssp. bescii, hereafter referred to as S. bescii, is a root-associated fungus that promotes plant growth in both its native switchgrass host and a variety of monocots and dicots. Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a dual-purpose crop, used for both forage and grain production, significantly contributes to the agricultural economies of the Southern Great Plains, USA. In this study, we investigated the influence of S. bescii on growth and transcriptome regulation of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) metabolism in winter wheat. Serendipita bescii significantly improved lateral root growth and forage biomass under a limited N or P regime. Further, S. bescii activated sets of host genes regulating N and P starvation responses. These genes include, root-specific auxin transport, strigolactone and gibberellin biosynthesis, degradation of phospholipids and biosynthesis of glycerolipid, downregulation of ammonium transport and nitrate assimilation, restriction of protein degradation by autophagy and subsequent N remobilization. All these genes are hypothesized to regulate acquisition, assimilation and remobilization of N and P. Based on transcriptional level gene regulation and physiological responses to N or P limitation, we suggest S. bescii plays a critical role in modulating stress imposed by limitation of these two critical nutrients in winter wheat."

We hypothesized that elevated temperatures would cause an increase in the relative abundance of heat-stable Rca1β. Wheat plants were grown at 25° C : 18°C (day : night) and exposed to heat stress (38° C : 22°C) for up to 5 d at pre-anthesis. Carbon (C) assimilation, Rubisco activity, CA1Pase activity, transcripts of Rca1β, Rca2β, and Rca2α, and the quantities of the corresponding protein products were measured during and after heat stress. The transcript of Rca1β increased 40-fold in 4 h at elevated temperatures and returned to the original level after 4 h upon return of plants to control temperatures. Rca1β comprised up to 2% of the total Rca protein in unstressed leaves but increased three-fold in leaves exposed to elevated temperatures for 5 d and remained high at 4 h after heat stress. These results show that elevated temperatures cause rapid changes in Rca gene expression and adaptive changes in Rca isoform abundance. The improved understanding of the regulation of C assimilation under heat stress will inform efforts to improve wheat productivity and climate resilience."

"24742072","abstracttext","The Pm3 gene confers resistance against wheat powdery mildew. Studies of Pm3 diversity have shown that Pm3 alleles isolated from southern populations of wild emmer wheat located in Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, and Syria are more diverse and more distant from bread wheat alleles than alleles from the northern wild wheat populations located in Turkey, Iran, and Iraq. Therefore, southern populations from Israel were studied extensively to reveal novel Pm3 alleles that are absent from the cultivated gene pool. Candidate Pm3 genes were isolated via a polymerase chain reaction cloning approach. Known and newly identified Pm3 genes were subjected to variation analysis and polymorphic amino acid residues were superimposed on a three-dimensional (3D) model of PM3. The region of highest interspecies diversity between Triticum aestivum and T. dicoccoides lies in leucine-rich repeats (LRR) 19 to 24, whereas most intraspecies diversity in T. aestivum is located in LRR 25 to 28. Interestingly, these two regions are separated by one large LRR whose propensity for flexibility facilitates the conformation of the PM3 LRR domain into two differently structured models. The combination of evolutionary and protein 3D structure analysis revealed that Pm3 genes in wild and domesticated wheat show different evolutionary histories which might have been triggered through different interactions with the powdery mildew pathogen."

"32973841","abstracttext","Thinopyrum ponticum (2 n = 10 x = 70), a member of the tertiary gene pool of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), harbors many biotic and abiotic stress resistance genes. CH10A5, a novel disomic substitution line from a cross of T. aestivum cv. 7182 and Th. ponticum , was characterized by cytogenetic identification, in situ hybridization, molecular marker analysis, and morphological investigation of agronomic traits and disease resistance. Cytological observations showed that CH10A5 contained 42 chromosomes and formed 21 bivalents at meiotic metaphase I. Genome in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis indicated that two of its chromosomes came from the J s genome of Th. ponticum , and wheat 15K array mapping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) revealed that chromosome 1D was absent from CH10A5. Polymorphic analysis of molecular markers indicated that the pair of alien chromosomes belonged to homoeologous group one, designated as 1J s . Thus, CH10A5 was a wheat- Th. ponticum 1J s (1D) disomic substitution line. Field disease resistance trials demonstrated that the introduced Th. ponticum chromosome 1J s was probably responsible for resistance to both stripe rust and powdery mildew at the adult stage. Based on specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), 507 STS molecular markers were developed to distinguish chromosome 1J s genetic material from that of wheat. Of these, 49 STS markers could be used to specifically identify the genetic material of Th. ponticum . CH10A5 will increase the resistance gene diversity of wheat breeding materials, and the markers developed here will permit further tracing of heterosomal chromosome fragments in the future."

"12226325","abstracttext","Germin gene expression is induced in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves by powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici) infection. Germin is a protein marker for early cereal development and is an oxalate oxidase, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of oxalate to CO2 and H2O2. The induction of germin gene expression by powdery mildew infection is consistent with the importance of H2O2 to plant defense and identifies a mechanism for the elevation of H2O2 levels in wheat leaves. Germin mRNA levels increased 2 d after inoculation of seedlings with powdery mildew and continued to increase throughout an 8-d time course. The increase in accumulation of germin mRNA was accompanied by an increase in the germin oligomer, which reached maximal levels by d 6. An increase in oxalate oxidase activity paralleled germin oligomer accumulation. Germin gene expression was induced in a relatively resistant cultivar (Bobwhite) as well as in a susceptible cultivar (Cheyenne), suggesting that the induction of germin gene expression is an indicator of powdery mildew infection rather than cultivar resistance."

"12807786","abstracttext","We report the map-based cloning of the leaf rust resistance gene Lr21, previously mapped to a gene-rich region at the distal end of chromosome arm 1DS of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Molecular cloning of Lr21 was facilitated by diploid/polyploid shuttle mapping strategy. Cloning of Lr21 was confirmed by genetic transformation and by a stably inherited resistance phenotype in transgenic plants. Lr21 spans 4318 bp and encodes a 1080-amino-acid protein containing a conserved nucleotide-binding site (NBS) domain, 13 imperfect leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), and a unique 151-amino-acid sequence missing from known NBS-LRR proteins at the N terminus. Fine-structure genetic analysis at the Lr21 locus detected a noncrossover (recombination without exchange of flanking markers) within a 1415-bp region resulting from either a gene conversion tract of at least 191 bp or a double crossover. The successful map-based cloning approach as demonstrated here now opens the door for cloning of many crop-specific agronomic traits located in the gene-rich regions of bread wheat."

"16362275","abstracttext","A previous study in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) identified two candidate genes controlling a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) GluBx. These candidates were Glu-B1-1, the structural gene coding for Glu1Bx, and the B homoeologous gene coding for SPA (spa-B), a seed storage protein activator. The goal of this study was to identify the best candidate gene for this QTL. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are an abundant source of DNA polymorphisms that have been successfully used to identify loci associated with particular phenotypes. As no linkage disequilibrium was detected between Glu-B1-1 and spa-B, we performed an association study to identify the individual gene responsible for the QTL. Six SNPs, three located in Glu-B1-1 and three in spa-B, were genotyped by mass spectrometry in a collection of 113 bread wheat lines. These lines were also evaluated for protein content as well as the total quantity of HMW-GSs and of each HMW-GS in seed samples from two harvest years. Significant associations were detected only between Glu-B1-1 polymorphism and most of the traits evaluated. Spa-B was unambiguously discarded as a candidate. To our knowledge, this is the first report on an association study that was successfully used to discriminate between two candidate genes."

"16667278","abstracttext","An airgun apparatus has been constructed for transient gene expression studies of monocots. This device utilizes compressed air from a commercial airgun to propel macroprojectile and DNA-coated tungsten particles. The beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene was used to monitor transient expression in three distinct cell types of maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The highest level of GUS activity in cultured maize cells was observed when distance between stopping plate and target cells was adjusted to 4.3 centimeters. Efficiency of transformation was estimated to be 4.4 x 10(-3). In a partial vacuum of 700 millimeters Hg, velocity of macroprojectile was measured at 520 meters per second with a 6% reduction in velocity at atmospheric pressure. A polyethylene film placed in the breech before firing contributed to a 12% increase in muzzle velocity. A 700 millimeters Hg level of vacuum was necessary for maximum number of transfornants. GUS expression was also detected in wheat leaf base tissue of microdissected shoot apices. High levels of transient gene expression were also observed in hard, compact embryogenic callus of rice. These results show that the airgun apparatus is a convenient, safe, and low-cost device for rapid transient gene expression studies in cereals."

"20581307","abstracttext","To improve our understanding of the organization and evolution of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome, we sequenced and annotated 13-Mb contigs (18.2 Mb) originating from different regions of its largest chromosome, 3B (1 Gb), and produced a 2x chromosome survey by shotgun Illumina/Solexa sequencing. All regions carried genes irrespective of their chromosomal location. However, gene distribution was not random, with 75% of them clustered into small islands containing three genes on average. A twofold increase of gene density was observed toward the telomeres likely due to high tandem and interchromosomal duplication events. A total of 3222 transposable elements were identified, including 800 new families. Most of them are complete but showed a highly nested structure spread over distances as large as 200 kb. A succession of amplification waves involving different transposable element families led to contrasted sequence compositions between the proximal and distal regions. Finally, with an estimate of 50,000 genes per diploid genome, our data suggest that wheat may have a higher gene number than other cereals. Indeed, comparisons with rice (Oryza sativa) and Brachypodium revealed that a high number of additional noncollinear genes are interspersed within a highly conserved ancestral grass gene backbone, supporting the idea of an accelerated evolution in the Triticeae lineages."

The new gene, designated as TaAbc1, encodes a 717-amino acid, 80.35 kD protein. The TaAbc1 protein contains two conserved domains shared by Abc1-like proteins, two trans-membrane domains at the C-terminal, and a 36-amino acid chloroplast targeting presequence at the N-terminal. Characterization of TaAbc1 expression revealed that gene expression was tissue-specific and could be up-regulated by biotic agents (e.g., stripe rust pathogen) and/or by an abiotic stress like wounding. High-fold induction was associated with the hypersensitive response (HR) triggered only by avirulent stripe rust pathotypes, suggesting that TaAbc1 is a rust-pathotype specific HR-mediator. Down-regulating TaAbc1 reduced HR but not the overall resistance level in Suwon11 to CYR23, suggesting TaAbc1 was involved in HR against stripe rust, but overall host resistance is not HR-dependent."
"22606837","articletitle","Obviation of wheat resistance to the Hessian fly through systemic induced susceptibility."
"22606837","abstracttext","Unlike most documented plant-insect interactions, Hessian fly-resistance [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is initiated by a gene-for-gene recognition event in which plants carrying a specific R gene recognize salivary effectors encoded by a corresponding larval avirulence gene. However, dual infestation resulting from oviposition by virulent insects from 5 d before to 3 d after oviposition by avirulent insects on the same host plant, lead to systemic induced susceptibility, obviation of resistance, and ultimately the survival of both virulent and genetically avirulent progeny to adulthood. Simultaneous oviposition allowed greater survival of avirulent progeny than ovipositions separated by larger intervals. Because of the induction of plant resistance, hatch of avirulent larvae before virulent was more detrimental to rate of development than hatch of virulent before avirulent larvae. Obviation of resistance was not localized to the leaf being attacked by the virulent larvae, but also functioned across spatial distance into younger leaves. This research suggests that virulent Hessian fly larvae directly suppress the defense response of wheat, thus providing a refuge for avirulent genotypes, preserving diversity in field populations and increasing durability of deployed resistance genes."

"19222807","abstracttext","Engineering traits by the assembly of non-functional gene products is a promising tool for modern plant biotechnology. In this article, we describe the establishment of male sterility and herbicide resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) by complementing inactive precursor protein fragments through a split intein system. N- and C-terminal fragments of a barnase gene from Bacillus amyloliquifaciens were fused to intein sequences from the Synechocystis sp. gene DnaB and delivered into the wheat genome via biolistic particle bombardment. Both barnase fragments were expressed under the control of a tapetum-specific promoter. High efficiency of the split barnase system was achieved by introducing GGGGS linkers between the fusion domains of the assembled protein. Depending on the vector version that was transformed, up to 51% of primary transformed plants produced sterile pollen. In the F(1) progeny, the male-sterile phenotype segregated with both barnase gene fragments. Expression of the cytotoxic barnase in the tapetum did not apparently affect the vegetative phenotype and remained stable under increased temperatures. In addition, the reconstitution of sulphonylurea resistance was achieved by DnaE intein-mediated assembly of a mutated acetolactate synthase (ALS) protein from rice. The impacts of the technical advances revealed in this study on the concepts for trait control, transgene containment and hybrid breeding are discussed."

"22334568","abstracttext","About 1 million expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences comprising 125.3 Mb nucleotides were accreted from 51 cDNA libraries constructed from a variety of tissues and organs under a range of conditions, including abiotic stresses and pathogen challenges in common wheat (Triticum aestivum). Expressed sequence tags were assembled with stringent parameters after processing with inbuild scripts, resulting in 37,138 contigs and 215,199 singlets. In the assembled sequences, 10.6% presented no matches with existing sequences in public databases. Functional characterization of wheat unigenes by gene ontology annotation, mining transcription factors, full-length cDNA, and miRNA targeting sites were carried out. A bioinformatics strategy was developed to discover single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within our large EST resource and reported the SNPs between and within (homoeologous) cultivars. Digital gene expression was performed to find the tissue-specific gene expression, and correspondence analysis was executed to identify common and specific gene expression by selecting four biotic stress-related libraries. The assembly and associated information cater a framework for future investigation in functional genomics."

"24241670","abstracttext","Anther-culture response was examined among three spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to evaluate the genetic component of response and to determine whether androgenetic performance could be improved by selection. The three lines, the three possible F1's among the three lines, their F2's, and the backcrosses to the parents were evaluated for callus production and regeneration capacity. Significant variation was observed among the generations of the three crosses for callus formation. Genetic variation for regenerability was nonsignificant. Callus production was negatively correlated (-0.24) with regeneration capacity. The random variation in the study was too great to determine whether major-gene differences for antherculture response exist among the three lines by examining population distributions. When the material was evaluated for quantitative gene effects, the estimates for the additive gene effects were generally greater than the estimates for the dominance gene effects for callus formation. Only the Pavon x Chris cross, however, exhibited a significant narrow sense heritability estimate for callusing response (0.94). Due to the large component of random variation and the varying selection potential among crosses for androgenetic performance, improving anther-culture response in wheat by selection could prove difficult unless the anther-culture process itself selects for response traits at the gametic level."

Yet the quality of the assemblies and the gene annotations varies considerably and often remains poor, affecting downstream analyses. This is particularly true when fragments of the same gene are annotated as distinct genes, which may cause them to be mistaken as paralogs."
"30184069","abstracttext_results","In this study, we introduce two novel phylogenetic tests to infer non-overlapping or partially overlapping genes that are in fact parts of the same gene. One approach collapses branches with low bootstrap support and the other computes a likelihood ratio test. We extensively validated these methods by (i) introducing and recovering fragmentation on the bread wheat, Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring, chromosome 3B; (ii) by applying the methods to the low-quality 3B assembly and validating predictions against the high-quality 3B assembly; and (iii) by comparing the performance of the proposed methods to the performance of existing methods, namely Ensembl Compara and ESPRIT. Application of this combination to a draft shotgun assembly of the entire bread wheat genome revealed 1221 pairs of genes that are highly likely to be fragments of the same gene. Our approach demonstrates the power of fine-grained evolutionary inferences across multiple species to improving genome assemblies and annotations."

"16061294","articletitle","Wheat non-specific lipid transfer protein genes display a complex pattern of expression in developing seeds."
"16061294","abstracttext","Nine cDNA clones encoding non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) were isolated from Triticum aestivum and Triticum durum cDNA libraries and characterized. One cDNA is predicted to encode a type 2 nsLTP (7 kDa) while others encode type 1 nsLTPs (9 kDa). All encoded proteins contain an N-terminal signal sequence and possess the characteristic features of nsLTPs. The genomic structures of the wheat nsLtp genes show that type 2 TaLtp7.1a, TaLtp7.2a and type 1 TaLtp9.2b genes lack introns while the other type 1 genes consist of one intron. Construction of a phylogenic tree of Poaceae nsLTPs shows that wheat nsLTPs can be divided into eleven distinct groups and are closely related to barley sequences. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis, the expression patterns of nine nsLtp genes were studied during wheat seed development and germination. We identified three different profiles of nsLtp gene transcript accumulation. Whereas TdLtp7.1a, TdLtp9.4a and TdLtp9.7a transcripts were detected during all maturation stages, TdLtp7.2a, TdLtp9.2a, TdLtp9.3a, TdLtp9.5a and TdLtp9.6a transcripts were only present in the first and TdLtp9.1a in the last stages of seed development. Moreover, these nine wheat nsLtp genes are not seed-specific and are also expressed in the coleoptile of young seedlings. The present study revealed the complexity of the wheat nsLtp gene family and showed that the expression of nsLtp genes is developmentally regulated in the seeds, suggesting a specific function for each of the corresponding proteins."
"33127757","articletitle","Copy number variation of TdDof controls solid-stemmed architecture in wheat."
"33127757","abstracttext","Stem solidness is an important agronomic trait of durum ( Triticum turgidum L. var. durum ) and bread ( Triticum aestivum L.) wheat that provides resistance to the wheat stem sawfly. This dominant trait is conferred by the SSt1 locus on chromosome 3B. However, the molecular identity and mechanisms underpinning stem solidness have not been identified. Here, we demonstrate that copy number variation of TdDof , a gene encoding a putative DNA binding with one finger protein, controls the stem solidness trait in wheat. Using map-based cloning, we localized TdDof to within a physical interval of 2.1 Mb inside the SSt1 locus. Molecular analysis revealed that hollow-stemmed wheat cultivars such as Kronos carry a single copy of TdDof , whereas solid-stemmed cultivars such as CDC Fortitude carry multiple identical copies of the gene. Deletion of all TdDof copies from CDC Fortitude resulted in the loss of stem solidness, whereas the transgenic overexpression of TdDof restored stem solidness in the TdDof deletion mutant pithless1 and conferred stem solidness in Kronos. In solid-stemmed cultivars, increased TdDof expression was correlated with the down-regulation of genes whose orthologs have been implicated in programmed cell death (PCD) in other species. Anatomical and histochemical analyses revealed that hollow-stemmed lines had stronger PCD-associated signals in the pith cells compared to solid-stemmed lines, which suggests copy number-dependent expression of TdDof could be directly or indirectly involved in the negative regulation of PCD. These findings provide opportunities to manipulate stem development in wheat and other monocots for agricultural or industrial purposes."

"29967989","abstracttext_key message","A single recessive powdery mildew resistance gene Pm61 from wheat landrace Xuxusanyuehuang was mapped within a 0.46-cM genetic interval spanning a 1.3-Mb interval of the genomic region of chromosome arm 4AL. Epidemics of powdery mildew incited by the biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) have caused significant yield reductions in many wheat (Triticum aestivum)-producing regions. Identification of powdery mildew resistance genes is required for sustainable improvement of wheat for disease resistance. Chinese wheat landrace Xuxusanyuehuang was resistant to several Bgt isolates at the seedling stage. Genetic analysis based on the inoculation of Bgt isolate E09 on the F 1 , F 2 , and F 2:3 populations produced by crossing Xuxusanyuehuang to susceptible cultivar Mingxian 169 revealed that the resistance of Xuxusanyuehuang was controlled by a single recessive gene. Bulked segregant analysis and simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping placed the gene on chromosome bin 4AL-4-0.80-1.00. Comparative genomics analysis was performed to detect the collinear genomic regions of Brachypodium distachyon, rice, sorghum, Aegilops tauschii, T. urartu, and T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides. Based on the use of 454 contig sequences and the International Wheat Genome Sequence Consortium survey sequence of Chinese Spring wheat, four EST-SSR and seven SSR markers were linked to the gene. An F 5 recombinant inbred line population derived from Xuxusanyuehuang × Mingxian 169 cross was used to develop the genetic linkage map. The gene was localized in a 0.46-cM genetic interval between Xgwm160 and Xicsx79 corresponding to 1.3-Mb interval of the genomic region in wheat genome. This is a new locus for powdery mildew resistance on chromosome arm 4AL and is designated Pm61."

"17426773","abstracttext","Triticum turgidum L var. durum is known to be particularly susceptible to infection by Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent for Fusarium head blight (FHB), which results in severe yield losses and grain contaminated with mycotoxins. This research was aimed at identifying FHB resistance in tetraploid wheat and mapping the location of FHB resistance genes. A tetraploid cross of durum wheat ('Strongfield') x Triticum carthlicum ('Blackbird') was used to generate a doubled-haploid (DH) population. This population was evaluated for type II resistance to F. graminearum in replicated greenhouse trials, in which heads were innoculated and the percent of infected spikelets was determined 21 days later. The population was also genotyped with microsatellite markers to construct a map of 424 loci, covering 2 052 cM. The FHB reaction and genotypic data were used to identify FHB resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs). It was determined that 2 intervals on chromosomes 2BL and 6BS controlled FHB resistance in this tetraploid cross. The FHB resistance allele on chromosome 2BL (r2=0.26, logarithm of odds (LOD)=8.5) was derived from 'Strongfield', and the FHB resistance allele on chromosome 6BS (r2=0.23, LOD=6.6) was derived from 'Blackbird'. Two other loci, on chromosomes 5AS and 2AL, were shown to regulate FHB infection and to have an epistatic effect on the FHB resistance QTL on chromosome 6BS. Further, the FHB resistance QTL peak on chromosome 6BS was clearly coincident with the known FHB resistance gene Fhb2, derived from Sumai 3. The results show that FHB resistance can be expressed in durum wheat, and that T. carthlicum and Triticum aestivum likely share a common FHB resistance gene on chromosome 6BS."

"18046532","abstracttext","Allele diversities of four markers specific to intron three, exon four and promoter regions of the aluminum (Al) resistance gene of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) TaALMT1 were compared in 179 common wheat cultivars used in international wheat breeding programs. In wheat cultivars released during the last 93 years, six different promoter types were identified on the basis of allele size. A previous study showed that Al resistance was not associated with a particular coding allele for TaALMT1 but was correlated with blocks of repeated sequence upstream of the coding sequence. We verified the linkage between these promoter alleles and Al resistance in three doubled haploid and one intercross populations segregating for Al resistance. Molecular and pedigree analysis suggest that Al resistance in modern wheat germplasm is derived from several independent sources. Analysis of a population of 278 landraces and subspecies of wheat showed that most of the promoter alleles associated with Al resistance pre-existed in Europe, the Middle East and Asia prior to dispersal of cultivated germplasm around the world. Furthermore, several new promoter alleles were identified among the landraces surveyed. The TaALMT1 promoter alleles found within the spelt wheats were consistent with the hypothesis that these spelts arose on several independent occasions from hybridisations between non-free-threshing tetraploid wheats and Al-resistant hexaploid bread wheats. The strong correlation between Al resistance and Al-stimulated malate efflux from the root apices of 49 diverse wheat genotypes examined was consistent with the previous finding that Al resistance in wheat is conditioned primarily by malate efflux. These results demonstrate that the markers based on intron, exon and promoter regions of TaALMT1 can trace the inheritance of the Al resistance locus within wheat pedigrees and track Al resistance in breeding programmes."

"24393105","abstracttext","Salinity and drought are major limiting factors of wheat (Triticum aestivum) productivity worldwide. Here, we report the function of a wheat ERF transcription factor TaERF3 in salt and drought responses and the underlying mechanism of TaERF3 function. Upon treatment with 250 mM NaCl or 20% polyethylene glycol (PEG), transcript levels of TaERF3 were rapidly induced in wheat. Using wheat cultivar Yangmai 12 as the transformation recipient, four TaERF3-overexpressing transgenic lines were generated and functionally characterized. The seedlings of the TaERF3-overexpressing transgenic lines exhibited significantly enhanced tolerance to both salt and drought stresses as compared to untransformed wheat. In the leaves of TaERF3-overexpressing lines, accumulation levels of both proline and chlorophyll were significantly increased, whereas H₂O₂ content and stomatal conductance were significantly reduced. Conversely, TaERF3-silencing wheat plants that were generated through virus-induced gene silencing method displayed more sensitivity to salt and drought stresses compared with the control plants. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that transcript levels of ten stress-related genes were increased in TaERF3-overexpressing lines, but compromised in TaERF3-silencing wheat plants. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed that the TaERF3 protein could interact with the GCC-box cis-element present in the promoters of seven TaERF3-activated stress-related genes. These results indicate that TaERF3 positively regulates wheat adaptation responses to salt and drought stresses through the activation of stress-related genes and that TaERF3 is an attractive engineering target in applied efforts to improve abiotic stress tolerances in wheat and other cereals."

"24354426","abstracttext_background","Wheat gluten is important for the industrial quality of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum wheat (T. turgidum L.). Gluten proteins are also the source of immunogenic peptides that can trigger a T cell reaction in celiac disease (CD) patients, leading to inflammatory responses in the small intestine. Various peptides with three major T cell epitopes involved in CD are derived from alpha-gliadin fraction of gluten. Alpha-gliadins are encoded by a large multigene family and amino acid variation in the CD epitopes is known to influence the immunogenicity of individual gene family members. Current commercial methods of gluten detection are unable to distinguish between immunogenic and non-immunogenic CD epitope variants and thus to accurately quantify the overall CD epitope load of a given wheat variety. Such quantification is indispensable for correct selection of wheat varieties with low potential to cause CD."
"24354426","abstracttext_results","A 454 RNA-amplicon sequencing method was developed for alpha-gliadin transcripts encompassing the three major CD epitopes and their variants. The method was used to screen developing grains on plants of 61 different durum wheat cultivars and accessions. A dedicated sequence analysis pipeline returned a total of 304 unique alpha-gliadin transcripts, corresponding to a total of 171 'unique deduced protein fragments' of alpha-gliadins. The numbers of these fragments obtained in each plant were used to calculate quantitative and quantitative differences between the CD epitopes expressed in the endosperm of these wheat plants. A few plants showed a lower fraction of CD epitope-encoding alpha-gliadin transcripts, but none were free of CD epitopes."

"28922762","abstracttext","Plant phloem-based defence (PBD) against phloem-feeding insects is characteristic of the sieve occlusion by phloem lectins and β-1,3-glucan callose, both of which are produced under regulation by ethylene and MYB transcription factors. Wheat PBD requires β-1,3-glucan synthase-like proteins GSL2, GSL10, and GSL12, and may also require insect-resistant mannose-binding lectins Hfr-1 and Wci-1, which can accumulate in the phloem upon aphid feeding. This study elucidates whether any of the 73 MYB genes identified previously in the common wheat Triticum aestivum genome plays a role in wheat PBD activation with regard to the GSLs and lectins. Wheat MYB genes TaMYB19, TaMYB29, and TaMYB44 are highly activated in response to infestation of English grain aphid, and their silencing facilitates aphid feeding on wheat phloem and represses wheat PBD responses. Repressed PBD is shown to decrease aphid-induced callose deposition in wheat leaf epidermis and decrease aphid-induced expression of genes GSL2, GSL10, GSL12, Hfr-1, and Wci-1 in wheat leaf tissues. Based on single gene silencing effects, TaMYB19, TaMYB29, and TaMYB44 contribute 55-82% of PBD responses. However, the contributions of TaMYB genes to PBD are eliminated by ethylene signalling inhibitors, while simultaneous silencing of the three TaMYB genes cancels the tested PBD responses. Therefore, TaMYB19, TaMYB29, and TaMYB44 are co-regulators of wheat PBD and execute this function through crosstalk with the ethylene signalling pathway."

Previously associated markers with different wheat trait are also not available in any database. Limitations of in vitro SSR discovery can be overcome by genome-wide in silico mining of SSR. Triticum aestivum SSR database ( TaSSRDb ) is an integrated online database with three-tier architecture, developed using PHP and MySQL and accessible at http://webtom.cabgrid.res.in/wheatssr/. For genotyping, Primer3 standalone code computes primers on user request. Chromosome-wise SSR calling for all the three sub genomes along with choice of motif types is provided in addition to the primer generation for desired marker. We report here a database of highest number of SSRs (476,169) from complex, hexaploid wheat genome (~17 GB) along with previously reported 268 SSR markers associated with 11 traits. Highest (116.93 SSRs/Mb) and lowest (74.57 SSRs/Mb) SSR densities were found on 2D and 3A chromosome, respectively. To obtain homozygous locus, e-PCR was done. Such 30 loci were randomly selected for PCR validation in panel of 18 wheat Advance Varietal Trial (AVT) lines. TaSSRDb can be a valuable genomic resource tool for linkage mapping, gene/QTL (Quantitative trait locus) discovery, diversity analysis, traceability and variety identification. Varietal specific profiling and differentiation can supplement DUS (Distinctiveness, Uniformity, and Stability) testing, EDV (Essentially Derived Variety)/IV (Initial Variety) disputes, seed purity and hybrid wheat testing.

The populations were each genotyped using the wheat 90K Infinium iSelect SNP assay. A total of 29,692 SNP markers were mapped on 21 linkage groups corresponding to 21 hexaploid wheat chromosomes, covering 2,906.86 cM, with an overall marker density of 10.21 markers/cM. Compared with the previous maps based on the wheat 90K SNP chip detected 22,736 (76.6%) of the SNPs with consistent chromosomal locations, whereas 1,974 (6.7%) showed different chromosomal locations, and 4,982 (16.8%) were newly mapped. Alignment of the present consensus map and the wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) Chromosome Bin Map enabled assignment of 1,221 SNP markers to specific chromosome bins and 819 ESTs were integrated into the consensus map. The marker orders of the consensus map were validated based on physical positions on the wheat genome with Spearman rank correlation coefficients ranging from 0.69 (4D) to 0.97 (1A, 4B, 5B, and 6A), and were also confirmed by comparison with genetic position on the previously 40K SNP consensus map with Spearman rank correlation coefficients ranging from 0.84 (6D) to 0.99 (6A). Chromosomal rearrangements reported previously were confirmed in the present consensus map and new putative rearrangements were identified. In addition, an integrated consensus map was developed through the combination of five published maps with ours, containing 52,607 molecular markers. The consensus map described here provided a high-density SNP marker map and a reliable order of SNPs, representing a step forward in mapping and validation of chromosomal locations of SNPs on the wheat 90K array. Moreover, it can be used as a reference for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping to facilitate exploitation of genes and QTL in wheat breeding."

"31369363","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major fungal disease affecting wheat production worldwide. Since the early 1990s, FHB, caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum , has become one of the most significant diseases faced by wheat producers in Canada and the United States. The increasing FHB problem is likely due to the increased adoption of conservation tillage practices, expansion of maize production, use of susceptible wheat varieties in rotation, and climate variability. Durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum sp. durum ) is notorious for its extreme susceptibility to FHB and breeding for resistance is complicated because sources of FHB resistance are rare in the primary gene pool of tetraploid wheat. Losses due to this disease include yield, test weight, seed quality, food and feed quality, and when severe, market access. More importantly, it is the contamination with mycotoxins, such as deoxynivalenol, in Fusarium -infected durum kernels that causes the most serious economic as well as food and feed safety concerns. Several studies and thorough reviews have been published on germplasm development and breeding for FHB resistance and the genetics and genomics of FHB resistance in bread or common wheat ( T. aestivum ); however, similar reviews have not been conducted in durum wheat. Thus, the aim of this review is to summarize and discuss the recent research efforts to mitigate FHB in durum wheat, including quantitative trait locus mapping, genome-wide association studies, genomic prediction, mutagenesis and characterization of genes and pathways involved in FHB resistance. It also highlights future directions, FHB-resistant germplasm, and the potential role of morphological traits to enhance FHB resistance in durum wheat."

"31640550","abstracttext_background","The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), belonging to the gall midge family (Cecidomyiidae), is a devastating pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum) causing significant yield losses. Despite identification and characterization of numerous Hessian fly-responsive genes and associated biological pathways involved in wheat defense against this dipteran pest, their functional validation has been challenging. This is largely attributed to the large genome, polyploidy, repetitive DNA, and limited genetic resources in hexaploid wheat. The diploid progenitor Aegilops tauschii, D-genome donor of modern-day hexaploid wheat, offers an ideal surrogate eliminating the need to target all three homeologous chromosomes (A, B and D) individually, and thereby making the functional validation of candidate Hessian fly-responsive genes plausible. Furthermore, the well-annotated sequence of Ae. tauschii genome and availability of genetic resources amenable to manipulations makes the functional assays less tedious and time-consuming. However, prior to utilization of this diploid genome for downstream studies, it is imperative to characterize its physical and molecular responses to Hessian fly."

"33155062","abstracttext_key message","We identified genomic regions associated with six quality-related traits in wheat under two sowing conditions and analyzed the effects of multienvironment-significant SNPs on the stability of these traits. Grain quality affects the nutritional and commercial value of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and is a critical factor influencing consumer preferences for specific wheat varieties. Climate change is predicted to increase environmental stress and thereby reduce wheat quality. Here, we performed a genotyping assay involving the use of the wheat 90 K array in a genome-wide association study of six quality-related traits in 486 wheat accessions under two sowing conditions (normal and late sowing) over 4 years. We identified 64 stable quantitative trait loci (QTL), including 10 for grain protein content, 9 for wet gluten content, 4 for grain starch content, 14 for water absorption, 15 for dough stability time and 12 for grain hardness in wheat under two sowing conditions. These QTL harbored 175 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), explaining approximately 3-13% of the phenotypic variation in multiple environments. Some QTL on chromosomes 6A and 5D were associated with multiple traits simultaneously, and two (QNGPC.cau-6A, QNGH.cau-5D) harbored known genes, such as NAM-A1 for grain protein content and Pinb for grain hardness, whereas other QTL could facilitate gene discovery. Forty-three SNPs that were detected under late or both normal and late sowing conditions appear to be related to phenotypic stability. The effects of these SNP alleles were confirmed in the association population. The results of this study will be useful for further dissecting the genetic basis of quality-related traits in wheat and developing new wheat cultivars with desirable alleles to improve the stability of grain quality."

"985382","abstracttext","The tissue and developmental specificities of the acid phosphatase (ACPH) isozymes of Triticum aestivum and its progenitor species T. turgidum and T. tauschii have been determined and compared using the zymogram technique. Tissue and/or developmental variation in relative staining intensity, suggestive of variation in the quantity of active enzyme present, was observed for each of the seven major isozymes expressed. Isozymes homologous to each of the major isozymes of the hexaploid were detected in one or the other of the progenitor species. No difference in the pattern of developmental or tissue specificity was observed between the species for any isozyme. However, ACPH-4, encoded by ACph4, a structural gene linked to chromosome 4A, differs in electrophoretic mobility between T. aestivum and T. turgidum, indicating that divergence has occurred between these species at the Acph4 locus since the origin of the hexaploid. The molecular weight of each of five ACPH isozymes of the hexaploid was determined to be approximately 58,000. This finding, plus the results of the developmental study and the earlier demonstration that the structural genes for six isozymes (includinomosomes, provides evidence in support of the suggestion that the ACPH structural genes of hexaploid wheat are homoeologous related."

"18470225","abstracttext","Low-temperature response was measured at the whole plant and at the molecular level in wheat-rye amphiploids and in other interspecific combinations. Cold tolerance of interspecifics whose parents diverged widely in hardiness levels resembled the less hardy higher ploidy level wheat parent. Expression of the low-temperature induced Wcs120 gene of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell.) has been associated with freezing tolerance and was used here to study mRNA and protein accumulation in interspecific and parental lines during cold acclimation. Northern and Western analyses showed that homologous mRNAs and proteins were present in all the related species used in the experiments. Cold-tolerant rye (Secale cereale L.) produced a strong mRNA signal that was sustained throughout the entire 49-day cold-acclimation period. The wheats produced a mRNA signal that had diminished after 49 days of low-temperature exposure. The wheat-rye triticales did not exhibit the independent accumulation kinetics of the cold-tolerant rye parent but, rather, more closely resembled the wheat parent in that the mRNA signal was greatly diminished after 49 days of low-temperature exposure. The influence of the rye genome was manifest in slightly greater mRNA and protein accumulation in earlier stages of acclimation. Protein accumulations in the triticales were also maintained to a somewhat greater extent than found in the wheats at the end of the 49-day acclimation period. Protein accumulations in the wheat-crested wheatgrass (Agropyron cristatum L. Gaertner) interspecific resembled that of the wheat parent. The influence of the higher ploidy level wheats of the expression of homologous gene families from wheat-related hardy diploids in interspecific combinations may in part explain the poor cold tolerance observed."
"16740148","articletitle","Rapid generation of new powdery mildew resistance genes after wheat domestication."
"16740148","abstracttext","Plant defence against pathogens is controlled by disease resistance (R) gene products that directly or indirectly detect specific pathogen effectors. Plant-pathogen interactions have been proposed to follow a co-evolutionary arms-race model where R genes are recent and evolve rapidly in response to structural changes in matching pathogen effectors. However, the longevity and extensive polymorphism of R genes studied were more consistent with balancing selection maintaining ancient and diverse R genes or alleles. In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), the Pm3 locus confers race-specific resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. triticii). Here we describe recently generated Pm3 resistance alleles that all derive from one susceptible allele, Pm3CS, which is widespread among hexaploid bread-wheat lines. One group of four Pm3 resistance alleles shows few, clearly delimited, polymorphic sequence blocks of ancient origin, embedded in sequences identical to Pm3CS and possibly derived from gene conversion. A second group of three alleles differs from Pm3CS by only two to five mutations, all non-synonymous, and all in the leucine-rich repeat-encoding region. Transient transformation experiments confirmed that Pm3 resistance specificities are based on one or few amino acid changes. The Pm3CS allele was found in wild tetraploid wheat, the ancestor of hexaploid bread wheat, specifically from southern Turkey, a region proposed to be the site of wheat domestication. Based on these data, we propose that the Pm3 resistance alleles were generated in agricultural ecosystems after domestication of wheat 10,000 years ago. The evolution of Pm3 alleles in wheat is best described by the model of evolved recycling, where novel genetic variation is integrated in plant populations together with recycling of old variation."

"28703466","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) spike architecture is an important agronomic trait. The Q gene plays a key role in the domestication of bread wheat spike architecture. However, the regulatory mechanisms of Q expression and transcriptional activity remain largely unknown. In this study, we show that overexpression of bread wheat tae-miR172 caused a speltoid-like spike phenotype, reminiscent of that in wheat plants with the q gene. The reduction in Q transcript levels in the tae-miR172 overexpression transgenic bread wheat lines suggests that the Q expression can be suppressed by tae-miR172 in bread wheat. Indeed, our RACE analyses confirmed that the Q mRNA is targeted by tae-miR172 for cleavage. According to our analyses, the Q protein is localized in nucleus and confers transcriptional repression activity. Meanwhile, the Q protein could physically interact with the bread wheat transcriptional co-repressor TOPLESS (TaTPL). Specifically, the N-terminal ethylene-responsive element binding factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) (LDLNVE) motif but not the C-terminal EAR (LDLDLR) motif of Q protein mediates its interaction with the CTLH motif of TaTPL. Moreover, we show that the N-terminal EAR motif of Q protein is also essentially required for the transcriptional repression activity of Q protein. Taken together, we reveal the functional regulation of Q protein by tae-miR172 and transcriptional co-repressor TaTPL in controlling the bread wheat spike architecture."

"29403523","abstracttext","Cyclic nucleotide gated channels (CNGCs) play multifaceted roles in plants, particularly with respect to signaling processes associated with abiotic stress signaling and during host-pathogen interactions. Despite key roles during plant survival and response to environment, little is known about the activity and function of CNGC family in common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), a key stable food around the globe. In this study, we performed a genome-wide identification of CNGC family in wheat and identified a total 47 TaCNGCs in wheat, classifying these genes into four major groups (I-IV) with two sub-groups (IVa and IVb). Sequence analysis revealed the presence of several conserved motifs, including a phosphate binding cassette (PBC) and a ""hinge"" region, both of which have been hypothesized to be critical for the function of wheat CNGCs. During wheat infection with Pst , the transcript levels of TaCNGC14 and TaCNGC16 , both members of group IVb, showed significant induction during a compatible interaction, while a reduction in gene expression was observed in incompatible interactions. In addition, TaCNGC14 and TaCNGC16 mRNA accumulation was significantly influenced by exogenously applied hormones, including abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and salicylic acid (SA), suggesting a role in hormone signaling and/or perception. Silencing of TaCNGC14 and TaCNGC16 limited Pst growth and increased wheat resistance against Pst . The results presented herein contribute to our understanding of the wheat CNGC gene family and the mechanism of TaCNGCs signaling during wheat- Pst interaction."

"18847483","abstracttext_background","Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) is a powerful tool for genome-wide transcription studies. Unlike microarrays, it has the ability to detect novel forms of RNA such as alternatively spliced and antisense transcripts, without the need for prior knowledge of their existence. One limitation of using SAGE on an organism with a complex genome and lacking detailed sequence information, such as the hexaploid bread wheat Triticum aestivum, is accurate annotation of the tags generated. Without accurate annotation it is impossible to fully understand the dynamic processes involved in such complex polyploid organisms. Hence we have developed and utilised novel procedures to characterise, in detail, SAGE tags generated from the whole grain transcriptome of hexaploid wheat."
"18847483","abstracttext_results","Examination of 71,930 Long SAGE tags generated from six libraries derived from two wheat genotypes grown under two different conditions suggested that SAGE is a reliable and reproducible technique for use in studying the hexaploid wheat transcriptome. However, our results also showed that in poorly annotated and/or poorly sequenced genomes, such as hexaploid wheat, considerably more information can be extracted from SAGE data by carrying out a systematic analysis of both perfect and ""fuzzy"" (partially matched) tags. This detailed analysis of the SAGE data shows first that while there is evidence of alternative polyadenylation this appears to occur exclusively within the 3' untranslated regions. Secondly, we found no strong evidence for widespread alternative splicing in the developing wheat grain transcriptome. However, analysis of our SAGE data shows that antisense transcripts are probably widespread within the transcriptome and appear to be derived from numerous locations within the genome. Examination of antisense transcripts showing sequence similarity to the Puroindoline a and Puroindoline b genes suggests that such antisense transcripts might have a role in the regulation of gene expression."
"18847483","abstracttext_conclusion","Our results indicate that the detailed analysis of transcriptome data, such as SAGE tags, is essential to understand fully the factors that regulate gene expression and that such analysis of the wheat grain transcriptome reveals that antisense transcripts maybe widespread and hence probably play a significant role in the regulation of gene expression during grain development."

In this study, we conducted RNA sequencing of the transcriptomes of the pistillody stamen (PS) and the pistil (P) from HTS-1 plants, and the stamen (S) from the non-pistillody control variety Chinese Spring TP to gain insights into pistil and stamen development in wheat."

"26602233","abstracttext_abstract","A quantitative trait locus QYr.osu-5A on the long arm of chromosome 5A in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42; AABBDD) was previously reported to confer consistent resistance in adult plants to predominant stripe rust races, but the gene causing the quantitative trait locus (QTL) is not known. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were used to saturate the QTL region. Comparative and syntenic regions between wheat and rice (Oryza sativa) were applied to identify candidate genes for QYr.osu-5A. TaXA21-A1, which is referred to as a wheat ortholog of OsXA21-like gene on chromosome 9 in rice, was mapped under the peak of the QYr.osu-5A. TaXA21-A1 not only explained the phenotypic variation in reaction to different stripe rust races but also showed significant effects on resistance to powdery mildew and Hessian fly biotype BP. The natural allelic variation resulted in the alternations of four amino acids in deduced TaXA21-A1 proteins. The interacting proteins of TaXA21-A1 were different from those identified by OsXA21 on rice chromosome 11 against bacterial leaf blight. TaXA21-A1 confers unique resistance against multiple pests in wheat but might not have common protein interactors or thus overlapping functions with OsXA21 in rice. XA21 function has diverged during evolution of cereal crops. The molecular marker developed for TaXA21-A1 would accelerate its application of the candidate gene at the QYr.osu-5A locus in wheat breeding programs."

"28596779","abstracttext","Aldehyde Oxidase (AO) enzyme (EC 1.2.3.1) catalyzes the final steps of carotenoid catabolism and it is a key enzyme in the abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis. AO isoforms are located in the cytosolic compartment of tissues in many plants, where induce the oxidation of aldehydes into carboxylic acid, and in addition, catalyze the hydroxylation of some heterocycles. The goal of the present study was to characterize the AO genes involved in the accumulation of carotenoid pigments in wheat grain, an important quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. The cDNAs corresponding to the four AO isoforms from Arabidopsis thaliana and five AO isoforms from Brachypodium distachyon were used as query in 454 sequence assemblies data for Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (https://urgi.versailles.inra.fr/blast/blast.php) to obtain the partial or whole orthologous wheat AO sequences. Three wheat isoforms, designated AO1, AO2 , and AO3 were located on the chromosome groups 2, 5, and 7, respectively, and mapped on two consensus wheat maps by SNP markers located within the AO gene sequences. To validate the possible relationships between AO3 genes and carotenoid accumulation in wheat, the expression levels of AO-A3 and AO-B3 gene were determined during the kernel maturation stage of two durum wheat cultivars, Ciccio and Svevo, characterized by a low and high carotenoid content, respectively. Different AO-A3 gene expression values were observed between the two cultivars indicating that the AO-A3 allele present in Ciccio was more active in carotenoid degradation. A gene marker was developed and can be used for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding programs."

"8978071","abstracttext","We studied the distribution of genes and recombination in wheat (Triticum aestivum) group 1 chromosomes by comparing high-density physical and genetic maps. Physical maps of chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D were generated by mapping 50 DNA markers on 56 single-break deletion lines. A consensus physical map was compared with the 1D genetic map of Triticum tauschii (68 markers) and a Triticeae group 1 consensus map (288 markers) to generate a cytogenetic ladder map (CLM). Most group 1 markers (86%) were present in five clusters that encompassed only 10% of the group 1 chromosome. This distribution may reflect that of genes because more than half of the probes were cDNA clones and 30% were PstI genomic. All 14 agronomically important genes in group 1 chromosomes were present in these clusters. Most recombination occurred in gene-cluster regions. Markers fell at an average distance of 244 kb in these regions. The CLM involving the Triticeae consensus genetic map revealed that the above distribution of genes and recombination is the same in other Triticeae species. Because of a significant number of common markers, our CLM can be used for comparative mapping and to estimate physical distances among markers in many Poaceae species including rice and maize."

"16021401","abstracttext","Heterosis was defined as the advantage of hybrid performance over its parents in terms of growth and productivity. Previous studies showed that differential gene expression between hybrids and their parents is responsible for the heterosis; however, information on systematic identification and characterization of the differentially expressed genes are limited. In this study, an interspecific hybrid between common wheat (Triticum aestivum. L., 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) line 3338 and spelt (Triticum spelta L. 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) line 2463 was found to be highly heterotic in both aerial growth and root related traits, and was then used for expression assay. A modified suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to generate four subtracted cDNA libraries, and 748 nonreduandant cDNAs were obtained, among which 465 had high sequence similarity to the GenBank entries and represent diverse of functional categories, such as metabolism, cell growth and maintenance, signal transduction, photosynthesis, response to stress, transcription regulation and others. The expression patterns of 68.2% SSH-derived cDNAs were confirmed by reverse Northern blot, and semi-quantitative RT-PCR exhibited the similar results (72.2%). And it was concluded that the genes differentially expressed between hybrids and their parents involved in diverse physiological process pathway, which might be responsible for the observed heterosis."

"25425170","abstracttext_key message","A powdery mildew resistance gene was introgressed from Aegilops speltoides into winter wheat and mapped to chromosome 5BL. Closely linked markers will permit marker-assisted selection for the resistance gene. Powdery mildew of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a major fungal disease in many areas of the world, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). Host plant resistance is the preferred form of disease prevention because it is both economical and environmentally sound. Identification of new resistance sources and closely linked markers enable breeders to utilize these new sources in marker-assisted selection as well as in gene pyramiding. Aegilops speltoides (2n = 2x = 14, genome SS), has been a valuable disease resistance donor. The powdery mildew resistant wheat germplasm line NC09BGTS16 (NC-S16) was developed by backcrossing an Ae. speltoides accession, TAU829, to the susceptible soft red winter wheat cultivar 'Saluda'. NC-S16 was crossed to the susceptible cultivar 'Coker 68-15' to develop F2:3 families for gene mapping. Greenhouse and field evaluations of these F2:3 families indicated that a single gene, designated Pm53, conferred resistance to powdery mildew. Bulked segregant analysis showed that multiple simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers specific to chromosome 5BL segregated with the resistance gene. The gene was flanked by markers Xgwm499, Xwmc759, IWA6024 (0.7 cM proximal) and IWA2454 (1.8 cM distal). Pm36, derived from a different wild wheat relative (T. turgidum var. dicoccoides), had previously been mapped to chromosome 5BL in a durum wheat line. Detached leaf tests revealed that NC-S16 and a genotype carrying Pm36 differed in their responses to each of three Bgt isolates. Pm53 therefore appears to be a new source of powdery mildew resistance."

"21063061","abstracttext","The starch and protein in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) endosperm provide 20 percent of the calories eaten by humans and were heavily selected for during domestication. We examined the main storage products and gene expression patterns that may embody compositional differences between two wild species Aegilops crassa and Aegilops tauschii and cultivated bread wheat. The storage product profiles differed significantly with T. aestivum accumulating twice as much carbon as the wild species, while the latter had 1.5 to 2-fold more total nitrogen per seed. Transcriptional analyses of endosperms of similar fresh weight were compared using a cDNA macroarray. Aegilops tauschii, and especially Ae. crassa had stronger hybridizations with storage protein sequences, but while there were differences in transcripts for starch biosynthetic genes, they were less dramatic. Of these, we cloned the Starch Branching Enzymes (SBE) IIa promoter region and the genomic clone of the Brittle-1 (Bt1) ADPglucose transporter. While Ae. crassa SBEIIa sequence was more divergent than that of Ae. tauschii’s compared to bread wheat, there were no sequence polymorphisms that would explain the observed expression differences in Bt1 between these species. Furthermore, while there were nucleotide differences between Bt1 in Ae. crassa and bread wheat, they were synonymous at the amino acid level. Some of transcriptional differences identified here, however, deserve further examination as part of a strategy to manipulate wheat starch and protein composition."

"12114590","abstracttext","Cold acclimation and freezing tolerance are the result of complex interaction between low temperature, light, and photosystem II (PSII) excitation pressure. Previous results have shown that expression of the Wcs19 gene is correlated with PSII excitation pressure measured in vivo as the relative reduction state of PSII. Using cDNA library screening and data mining, we have identified three different groups of proteins, late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) 3-L1, LEA3-L2, and LEA3-L3, sharing identities with WCS19. These groups represent a new class of proteins in cereals related to group 3 LEA proteins. They share important characteristics such as a sorting signal that is predicted to target them to either the chloroplast or mitochondria and a C-terminal sequence that may be involved in oligomerization. The results of subcellular fractionation, immunolocalization by electron microscopy and the analyses of target sequences within the Wcs19 gene are consistent with the localization of WCS19 within the chloroplast stroma of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale). Western analysis showed that the accumulation of chloroplastic LEA3-L2 proteins is correlated with the capacity of different wheat and rye cultivars to develop freezing tolerance. Arabidopsis was transformed with the Wcs19 gene and the transgenic plants showed a significant increase in their freezing tolerance. This increase was only evident in cold-acclimated plants. The putative function of this protein in the enhancement of freezing tolerance is discussed."

Forty-nine of these isolates were identified by using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing and found to belong to a small group of actinobacterial genera including Streptomyces, Microbispora, Micromonospora, and Nocardiodes spp. Many of the Streptomyces spp. were found to be similar, on the basis of their 16S rDNA gene sequence, to Streptomyces spp. that had been isolated from potato scabs. In particular, several isolates exhibited high 16S rDNA gene sequence homology to Streptomyces caviscabies and S. setonii. None of these isolates, nor the S. caviscabies and S. setonii type strains, were found to carry the nec1 pathogenicity-associated gene or to produce the toxin thaxtomin, indicating that they were nonpathogenic. These isolates were recovered from healthy plants over a range of geographically and temporally isolated sampling events and constitute an important plant-microbe interaction."

"16133305","abstracttext","Improved resistance to preharvest sprouting in modern bread wheat (Triticum aestivum. L.) can be achieved via the introgression of grain dormancy and would reduce both the incidence and severity of damage due to unfavourable weather at harvest. The dormancy phenotype is strongly influenced by environmental factors making selection difficult and time consuming and this trait an obvious candidate for marker assisted selection. A highly significant Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) associated with grain dormancy and located on chromosome 4A was identified in three bread wheat genotypes, two white- and one red-grained, of diverse origin. Flanking SSR markers on either side of the putative dormancy gene were identified and validated in an additional population involving one of the dormant genotypes. Genotypes containing the 4A QTL varied in dormancy phenotype from dormant to intermediate dormant. Based on a comparison between dormant red- and white-grained genotypes, together with a white-grained mutant derived from the red-grained genotype, it is concluded that the 4A QTL is a critical component of dormancy; associated with at least an intermediate dormancy on its own and a dormant phenotype when combined with the R gene in the red-grained genotype and as yet unidentified gene(s) in the white-grained genotypes. These additional genes appeared to be different in AUS1408 and SW95-50213."

Five-day-old calli were irradiated by a focused laser microbeam to puncture momentarily made self-healing holes ( approximately 0.5 microm) in the cell wall and membrane to allow uptake of the exogenous DNA. The plant expression vector pAB6 containing bar gene as a selectable marker for the herbicide bialaphos resistance and GUS (uidA) gene as a reporter gene was used for transformation. No selection pressure was conducted during the four-week callus induction period. Induced calli were transferred to a modified MS medium with 1 mg l(-1) bialaphos for regeneration, followed by selection on 2 mg l(-1) bialaphos for rooting. Three regenerated putative transgenic events were evaluated for the integration and stable expression of both genes and results indicated that this modified procedure of laser-mediated transformation can be successfully used in transforming wheat."

"22140235","abstracttext","MYB transcription factors (TFs) play pivotal roles in the abiotic stress response in plants, but their characteristics and functions in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have not been fully investigated. A novel wheat MYB TF gene, TaMYB73, is reported here based on the observation that its targeting probe showed the highest salinity-inducibility level among all probes annotated as MYB TFs in the cDNA microarray. TaMYB73 is a R2R3 type MYB protein with transactivation activity, and binds with types I, II, and IIG MYB binding motifs. The gene was induced by NaCl, dehydration, and several phytohormones, as well as some stress-, ABA-, and GA-responsive cis-elements present in its promoter region. Its over-expression in Arabidopsis enhanced the tolerance to NaCl as well as to LiCl and KCl, whereas it had no contribution to mannitol tolerance. The over-expression lines had superior germination ability under NaCl and ABA treatments. The expression of many stress signalling genes such as AtCBF3 and AtABF3, as well as downstream responsive genes such as AtRD29A and AtRD29B, was improved in these over-expression lines, and TaMYB73 can bind with promoter sequences of AtCBF3 and AtABF3. Taken together, it is suggested that TaMYB73, a novel MYB transcription factor gene, participates in salinity tolerance based on improved ionic resistance partly via the regulation of stress-responsive genes."

"25151821","abstracttext","Our work aimed at a global investigation of the lipid metabolism during the induction of resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) against powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici). More specifically, the effect of salicylic acid, known as playing a key role in the activation of defence reactions against pathogens in plants, has been investigated. After salicylic acid infiltration, accumulation of phosphatidic acid was observed that could be due to the phospholipase C pathway since an up-regulation of a phospholipase C-encoding gene expression as well as an accumulation of diacylglycerol were observed. The phosphatidic acid accumulation could also result from the phospholipase D pathway since a reduction of phosphatidylethanolamine content occurred. The response to salicylic acid at the octadecanoid pathway level was also investigated: both a lipoxygenase-encoding gene expression and lipoxygenase enzymatic activity were induced by salicylic acid simultaneously with a decrease of the linolenic acid content. Finally, a lipid transfer protein-encoding gene expression was also up-regulated upon salicylic acid infiltration. These observations indicate that lipid metabolism could be considered as a marker of elicitation in wheat."

"27230563","abstracttext","Metacaspase orthologs are conserved in fungi, protozoa and plants, however, their roles in plant disease resistance are largely unknown. In this study, we identified a Triticum aestivum metacaspase gene, TaMCA1, with three copies located on chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D. The TaMCA1 protein contained typical structural features of type I metacaspases domains, including an N-terminal pro-domain. Transient expression analyses indicated that TaMCA1 was localized in cytosol and mitochondria. TaMCA1 exhibited no caspase-1 activity in vitro, but was able to inhibit cell death in tobacco and wheat leaves induced by the mouse Bax gene. In addition, the expression level of TaMCA1 was up-regulated following challenge with the Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Knockdown of TaMCA1 via virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) enhanced plant disease resistance to Pst, and the accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Further study showed that TaMCA1 decreased yeast cell resistance similar to the function of yeast metacaspase, and there was no interaction between TaMCA1 and TaLSD1. Based on these combined results, we speculate that TaMCA1, a regulator of cell death, is important during the compatible interaction of wheat and Pst."

"28369427","abstracttext","The tiller inhibition gene (tin) that reduces tillering in wheat (Triticum aestivum) is also associated with large spikes, increased grain weight, and thick leaves and stems. In this study, comparison of near-isogenic lines (NILs) revealed changes in stem morphology, cell wall composition, and stem strength. Microscopic analysis of stem cross-sections and chemical analysis of stem tissue indicated that cell walls in tin lines were thicker and more lignified than in free-tillering NILs. Increased lignification was associated with stronger stems in tin plants. A candidate gene for tin was identified through map-based cloning and was predicted to encode a cellulose synthase-like (Csl) protein with homology to members of the CslA clade. Dinucleotide repeat-length polymorphism in the 5'UTR region of the Csl gene was associated with tiller number in diverse wheat germplasm and linked to expression differences of Csl transcripts between NILs. We propose that regulation of Csl transcript and/or protein levels affects carbon partitioning throughout the plant, which plays a key role in the tin phenotype."

"30841228","abstracttext","Adult plant resistance to leaf rust in the Brazilian wheat cultivar Toropi (Triticum aestivum) was studied in crosses with the susceptible cultivar IAC 13. Cvs. Toropi and IAC 13 are susceptible at the seedling stage to race LCG-RS of Puccinia triticina Erikss., and to all other known Brazilian leaf-rust races. Thus, the resistance observed in Toropi in the field was due to adult plant-resistance genes. In the greenhouse at the adult plant stage, resistance segregated in a 7:9 ratio for two complementary recessive genes. Additionally, two recessive genes for leaf-tip necrosis were identified in the greenhouse environment. Necrosis was expressed when the two homozygous recessive genes occurred together in the F 2 , independently of the response to leaf rust. The resistance and leaf-necrosis genes differ from those previously reported in wheat. Segregation for leaf-rust resistance in the field at Passo Fundo, Brazil, fit a 1:3 ratio for a single recessive gene. With a different pathogen race, and in crosses of cvs. Toropi and ThatcherLr34, two recessive genes and a dominant gene for resistance were detected in the field in Mexico. The dominant gene was likely Lr34 from cv. ThatcherLr34 and the two recessive genes were likely those detected in the greenhouse adult plants tests at Passo Fundo."

"32688873","abstracttext","The RADiation sensitive protein 51 (RAD51) recombinase is a eukaryotic homologue of the bacterial Recombinase A (RecA). It is required for homologous recombination of DNA during meiosis where it plays a role in processes such as homology searching and strand invasion. RAD51 is well conserved in eukaryotes with as many as four paralogues identified in vertebrates and some higher plants. Here we report the isolation and preliminary characterisation of four RAD51 gene family members in hexaploid (bread) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). RAD51A1, RAD51A2 and RAD51D were located on chromosome group 7, and RAD51C was on chromosome group 2. Q-PCR gene expression profiling revealed that RAD51A1 was upregulated during meiosis with lower expression levels seen in mitotic tissue, and bioinformatics analysis demonstrated the evolutionary linkages of this gene family to other eukaryotic RAD51 sequences. Western blot analysis of heterologously expressed RAD51 from bread wheat has shown that it is detectable using anti-human RAD51 antibodies and that molecular modelling of the same protein revealed structural conservation when compared with yeast, human, Arabidopsis and maize RAD51A orthologues. This report has widened the knowledge base of this important protein family in plants, and highlighted the high level of structural conservation among RAD51 proteins from various species."

"17063340","abstracttext","In the ideal case, molecular markers used for marker-assisted selection are allele-specific even if the alleles differ only by a few nucleotide polymorphisms within the coding sequence of target genes. Such 'perfect' markers are completely correlated with the trait of interest. In hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) the Pm3 locus encodes seven alleles (Pm3a-Pm3g) conferring resistance to different races of Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, the agent of powdery mildew, a major disease of bread wheat. All Pm3 alleles are known at the molecular level. Here, we generated specific markers for the Pm3 alleles based on nucleotide polymorphisms of coding and adjacent non-coding regions. The specificity of these markers was validated in a collection of 93 modern or historically important cultivars and breeding lines of wheat and spelt (Triticum spelta L.). These markers confirmed the presence of the predicted Pm3 alleles in 31 varieties and lines known to carry Pm3 resistance alleles. In a few varieties, Pm3 alleles different from alleles previously described based on pathogenicity tests or tightly linked markers were observed. In all these cases, the identity of the marker-detected Pm3 alleles was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Pm3 markers confirmed the absence of known Pm3 resistance alleles in 54 European wheat and spelt varieties in which Pm3 alleles had not been previously identified. These results indicate that the developed markers are highly diagnostic for specific Pm3 resistance alleles in a wide range of varieties and breeding lines, and will be useful (1) for identifying Pm3 alleles in the wheat gene pool, (2) for efficient marker-assisted selection of these genes, and (3) for combining multiple Pm3 alleles within a single cultivar through transgenic approaches."
"25809554","articletitle","Genetic and epigenetic modifications to the BBAA component of common wheat during its evolutionary history at the hexaploid level."
"25809554","abstracttext","The formation and evolution of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., genome BBAADD) involves allopolyploidization events at two ploidy levels. Whether the two ploidy levels (tetraploidy and hexaploidy) have impacted the BBAA subgenomes differentially remains largely unknown. We have reported recently that extensive and distinct modifications of transcriptome expression occurred to the BBAA component of common wheat relative to the evolution of gene expression at the tetraploid level in Triticum turgidum. As a step further, here we analyzed the genetic and cytosine DNA methylation differences between an extracted tetraploid wheat (ETW) harboring genome BBAA that is highly similar to the BBAA subgenomes of common wheat, and a set of diverse T. turgidum collections, including both wild and cultivated genotypes. We found that while ETW had no significantly altered karyotype from T. turgidum, it diverged substantially from the later at both the nucleotide sequence level and in DNA methylation based on molecular marker assay of randomly sampled loci across the genome. In particular, ETW is globally less cytosine-methylated than T. turgidum, consistent with earlier observations of a generally higher transcriptome expression level in ETW than in T. turgidum. Together, our results suggest that genome evolution at the allohexaploid level has caused extensive genetic and DNA methylation modifications to the BBAA subgenomes of common wheat, which are distinctive from those accumulated at the tetraploid level in both wild and cultivated T. turgidum genotypes."

"29078294","abstracttext","The Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ( Pgt ) Ug99 race group is virulent to most stem rust resistance genes currently deployed in wheat and poses a threat to global wheat production. The durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum ) gene Sr13 confers resistance to Ug99 and other virulent races, and is more effective at high temperatures. Using map-based cloning, we delimited a candidate region including two linked genes encoding coiled-coil nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat proteins designated CNL3 and CNL13. Three independent truncation mutations identified in each of these genes demonstrated that only CNL13 was required for Ug99 resistance. Transformation of an 8-kb genomic sequence including CNL13 into the susceptible wheat variety Fielder was sufficient to confer resistance to Ug99, confirming that CNL13 is Sr13 CNL13 transcripts were slightly down-regulated 2-6 days after Pgt inoculation and were not affected by temperature. By contrast, six pathogenesis-related ( PR ) genes were up-regulated at high temperatures only when both Sr13 and Pgt were present, suggesting that they may contribute to the high temperature resistance mechanism. We identified three Sr13 -resistant haplotypes, which were present in one-third of cultivated emmer and durum wheats but absent in most tested common wheats ( Triticum aestivum ). These results suggest that Sr13 can be used to improve Ug99 resistance in a large proportion of modern wheat cultivars. To accelerate its deployment, we developed a diagnostic marker for Sr13 The identification of Sr13 expands the number of Pgt -resistance genes that can be incorporated into multigene transgenic cassettes to control this devastating disease."

"22214593","abstracttext","The plant chondriome confers a complex nature. The atp4 gene (formerly called orf25) of Aegilops crassa (CR) harbors the promoter sequence of the rps7 gene from common wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring, CS). The rps7 gene of CR has the promoter sequence of CS atp6. The atp6 gene of CR contains an unknown sequence inside of its coding region. Since repeat sequences have been found around the breaking points, these structural alterations are most likely generated through homologous recombination. In this study, PCR analysis was performed to detect structural alterations in each of three lines: euplasmic lines of Ae. crassa, Chinese Spring, and alloplasmic Chinese Spring wheat with the cytoplasm of Ae. crassa ((cr)-CS). We found that each of these lines contained both genotypes, although mitochondrial genotypes of CR in Chinese Spring wheat and CS genotypes in Ae. crassa were still retained as minor fractions (less than 10%). On the other hand, CS mitochondrial gene frequencies in ((cr)-CS) were shown to be ca. 30%. SNP analysis after DNA sequencing of these genes indicated that minor types of all three mitochondrial genes in alloplasmic wheat contained the mitochondrial gene types from pollens. Since the frequencies of paternal mitochondrial gene types in F(1) were about 20%, successive backcrossing increased the frequencies of paternal mitochondrial gene types to around 30% in alloplasmic wheat. Expression profiles of these mitochondrial genes were quantitatively analyzed by RT-PCR. Transcripts of paternal mitochondrial gene types were scarcely found. This suggests that minor fractions including paternal mitochondrial gene types are maintained and silenced in the descendants."

The multi-ovary trait of DUOII is controlled by a dominant gene, whose expression can be suppressed by the heterogeneous cytoplasm of TeZhiI (TZI), a line with the nucleus of common wheat and the cytoplasm of Aegilops. Crosses between female DUOII plants and male TZI plants resulted in multi-ovary F 1 s; whereas, the reciprocal crosses resulted in mono-ovary F 1 s. Although the multi-ovary trait is inherited as single trait controlled by a dominant allele in lines with a Triticum cytoplasm, the mechanism by which the special heterogeneous cytoplasm suppresses the expression of multi-ovary is not well understood."
"31046676","abstracttext_results","Observing the developmental process, we found that the critical stage of additional pistil primordium development was when the young spikes were 2-6 mm long. Then, we compared the quantitative proteomic profiles of 2-6 mm long young spikes obtained from the reciprocal crosses between DUOII and TZI. A total of 90 differentially expressed proteins were identified and analyzed based on their biological functions. These proteins had obvious functional pathways mainly implicated in chloroplast metabolism, nuclear and cell division, plant respiration, protein metabolism, and flower development. Importantly, we identified two key proteins, Flowering Locus K Homology Domain and PEPPER, which are known to play an essential role in the specification of pistil organ identity. By drawing relationships between the 90 differentially expressed proteins, we found that these proteins revealed a complex network which is associated with multi-ovary gene expression under heterogeneous cytoplasmic suppression."

"16177900","abstracttext","A powdery mildew resistance gene from Triticum urartu Tum. accession UR206 was successfully transferred into hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) through crossing and backcrossing. The F1 plants, which had 28 chromosomes and an average of 5.32 bivalents and 17.36 univalents in meiotic pollen mother cells (PMC), were obtained through embryos rescued owing to shriveling of endosperm in hybrid seed of cross Chinese Spring (CS) x UR206. Hybrid seeds were produced through backcrossing F1 with common wheat parents. The derivative lines had normal chromosome numbers and powdery mildew resistance similar to the donor UR206, indicating that the powdery mildew resistance gene originating from T. urartu accession UR206 was successfully transferred and expressed in a hexaploid wheat background. Genetic analysis indicated that a single dominant gene controlled the powdery mildew resistance at the seedling stage. To map and tag the powdery mildew resistance gene, 143 F2 individuals derived from a cross UR206 x UR203 were used to construct a linkage map. The resistant gene was mapped on the chromosome 7AL based on the mapped microsatellite makers. The map spanned 52.1 cM and the order of these microsatellite loci agreed well with the established microsatellite map of chromosome arm 7AL. The resistance gene was flanked by the microsatellite loci Xwmc273 and Xpsp3003, with the genetic distances of 2.2 cM and 3.8 cM, respectively. On the basis of the origin and chromosomal location of the gene, it was temporarily designated PmU."

"16187074","abstracttext","The storage protein polymers in the endosperm, stabilised by disulphide bonds, determine a number of processing qualities of wheat dough. The enzyme protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), involved in the formation of disulphide bonds, is strongly suggested to play a role in the formation of wheat storage protein bodies. Reports of the rice mutant esp2 exhibiting aberrant storage protein deposition in conjunction with a lack of PDI expression provided strong indications of a direct role for PDI in storage protein deposition. The potential significance of wheat PDI prompted the present studies into exploring any orthology between wheat PDI genes and rice PDI and esp2 loci. By designing allele-specific (AS)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) markers, two of the three wheat PDI genes could be genetically mapped to group 4 chromosomes and showed close association with GERMIN genes. Physical mapping led to localisation of wheat PDI genes to chromosomal ""bins"" on the proximal section of chromosome 4AL and distal sections of 4BS and 4DS. Identification of the putative PDI gene of rice and its comparison to the esp2 locus revealed that they were present at similar positions on the short arm of chromosome 11. Analysis of a large section of the PDI-containing section of rice chromosome 11S revealed a number of putative orthologues from The Institute for Genomic Research Triticum aestivum Gene Index database, of which five had been mapped, each localising to group 4 chromosomes, many in good agreement with our mapping results. The results strongly suggest a close linkage between the esp2 marker and the PDI gene of rice and an orthology between the PDI loci of rice and wheat and predict quantitative-trait loci involved in storage protein deposition at the PDI loci."

The greenbug-resistance gene Gb3 originated from Aegilops tauschii Coss. (2n = 2x = 14, genome D(t)D(t)) has shown consistent and durable resistance against prevailing greenbug biotypes in wheat fields. We previously mapped Gb3 in a recombination-rich, telomeric bin of wheat chromosome arm 7DL. In this study, high-resolution genetic mapping was carried out using an F(2:3) segregating population derived from two Ae. tauschii accessions, the resistant PI 268210 (original donor of Gb3 in the hexaploid wheat germplasm line 'Largo') and susceptible AL8/78. Molecular markers were developed by exploring bin-mapped wheat RFLPs, SSRs, ESTs and the Ae. tauschii physical map (BAC contigs). Wheat EST and Ae. tauschii BAC end sequences located in the deletion bin 7DL3-0.82-1.00 were used to design STS (sequence tagged site) or CAPS (Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence) markers. Forty-five PCR-based markers were developed and mapped to the chromosomal region spanning the Gb3 locus. The greenbug-resistance gene Gb3 now was delimited in an interval of 1.1 cM by two molecular markers (HI067J6-R and HI009B3-R). This localized high-resolution genetic map with markers closely linked to Gb3 lays a solid foundation for map based cloning of Gb3 and marker-assisted selection of this gene in wheat breeding."

"22070093","abstracttext","A key point of regulation of protein synthesis and amino acid homoeostasis in eukaryotes is the phosphorylation of the α subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) by protein kinase general control nonderepressible (GCN)-2. In this study, a GCN2-type PCR product (TaGCN2) was amplified from wheat (Triticum aestivum) RNA, while a wheat eIF2α homologue was identified in wheat genome data and found to contain a conserved target site for phosphorylation by GCN2. TaGCN2 overexpression in transgenic wheat resulted in significant decreases in total free amino acid concentration in the grain, with free asparagine concentration in particular being much lower than in controls. There were significant increases in the expression of eIF2α and protein phosphatase PP2A, as well as a nitrate reductase gene and genes encoding phosphoserine phosphatase and dihydrodipicolinate synthase, while the expression of an asparagine synthetase (AS1) gene and genes encoding cystathionine gamma-synthase and sulphur-deficiency-induced-1 all decreased significantly. Sulphur deficiency-induced activation of these genes occurred in wild-type plants but not in TaGCN2 overexpressing lines. Under sulphur deprivation, the expression of genes encoding aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase and 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase was also lower than in controls. The study demonstrates that TaGCN2 plays an important role in the regulation of genes encoding enzymes of amino acid biosynthesis in wheat and is the first to implicate GCN2-type protein kinases so clearly in sulphur signalling in any organism. It shows that manipulation of TaGCN2 gene expression could be used to reduce free asparagine accumulation in wheat grain and the risk of acrylamide formation in wheat products."

"26483801","abstracttext","The Auxin/indole-3-acetic acid (Aux/IAA) gene family plays key roles in the primary auxin-response process and controls a number of important traits in plants. However, the characteristics of the Aux/IAA gene family in hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have long been unknown. In this study, a comprehensive identification of the Aux/IAA gene family was performed using the latest draft genome sequence of the bread wheat ""Chinese Spring."" Thirty-four Aux/IAA genes were identified, 30 of which have duplicated genes on the A, B or D sub-genome, with a total of 84 Aux/IAA sequences. These predicted Aux/IAA genes were non-randomly distributed in all the wheat chromosomes except for chromosome 2D. The information of wheat Aux/IAA proteins is also described. Based on an analysis of phylogeny, expression and adaptive evolution, we prove that the Aux/IAA family in wheat has been replicated twice in the two allopolyploidization events of bread wheat, when the tandem duplication also occurred. The duplicated genes have undergone an evolutionary process of purifying selection, resulting in the high conservation of copy genes among sub-genomes and functional redundancy among several members of the TaIAA family. However, functional divergence probably existed in most TaIAA members due to the diversity of the functional domain and expression pattern. Our research provides useful information for further research into the function of Aux/IAA genes in wheat."

"27025509","abstracttext_key message","A new stem rust resistance gene Sr59 from Secale cereale was introgressed into wheat as a 2DS·2RL Robertsonian translocation. Emerging new races of the wheat stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici), from Africa threaten global wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. To broaden the resistance spectrum of wheat to these widely virulent African races, additional resistance genes must be identified from all possible gene pools. From the screening of a collection of wheat-rye (Secale cereale L.) chromosome substitution lines developed at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, we described the line 'SLU238' 2R (2D) as possessing resistance to many races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici, including the widely virulent race TTKSK (isolate synonym Ug99) from Africa. The breakage-fusion mechanism of univalent chromosomes was used to produce a new Robertsonian translocation: T2DS·2RL. Molecular marker analysis and stem rust seedling assays at multiple generations confirmed that the stem rust resistance from 'SLU238' is present on the rye chromosome arm 2RL. Line TA5094 (#101) was derived from 'SLU238' and was found to be homozygous for the T2DS·2RL translocation. The stem rust resistance gene on chromosome 2RL arm was designated as Sr59. Although introgressions of rye chromosome arms into wheat have most often been facilitated by irradiation, this study highlights the utility of the breakage-fusion mechanism for rye chromatin introgression. Sr59 provides an additional asset for wheat improvement to mitigate yield losses caused by stem rust."

"30135697","articletitle","Gene Co-expression Network Analysis Suggests the Existence of Transcriptional Modules Containing a High Proportion of Transcriptionally Differentiated Homoeologs in Hexaploid Wheat."
"30135697","abstracttext","Genome duplications aid in the formation of novel molecular networks through regulatory differentiation of the duplicated genes and facilitate adaptation to environmental change. Hexaploid wheat, Triticum aestivum , contains three homoeologous chromosome sets, the A-, B-, and D-subgenomes, which evolved through interspecific hybridization and subsequent whole-genome duplication. The divergent expression patterns of the homoeologs in hexaploid wheat suggest that they have undergone transcriptional and/or functional differentiation during wheat evolution. However, the distribution of transcriptionally differentiated homoeologs in gene regulatory networks and their related biological functions in hexaploid wheat are still largely unexplored. Therefore, we retrieved 727 publicly available wheat RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from various tissues, developmental stages, and conditions, and identified 10,415 expressed homoeologous triplets. Examining the co-expression modules in the wheat transcriptome, we found that 66% of the expressed homoeologous triplets possess all three homoeologs grouped in the same co-expression modules. Among these, 15 triplets contain co-expressed homoeologs with differential expression levels between homoeoalleles across ≥ 95% of the 727 RNA-seq datasets, suggesting a consistent trend of homoeolog expression bias. In addition, we identified 2,831 differentiated homoeologs that showed gene expression patterns that deviated from those of the other two homoeologs. We found that seven co-expression modules contained a high proportion of such differentiated homoeologs, which accounted for ≥ 20% of the genes in each module. We also found that five of the co-expression modules are abundantly composed of genes involved in biological processes such as chloroplast biogenesis, RNA metabolism, putative defense response, putative posttranscriptional modification, and lipid metabolism, thereby suggesting that, the differentiated homoeologs might highly contribute to these biological functions in the gene network of hexaploid wheat."

"31227524","abstracttext","The serine protease inhibitor (serpin) gene family is the largest family of protease inhibitors. Serine protease inhibitors have an active, but under-characterized, role in grain development and defense against pathogen attack in cereal crops. By exploiting publicly available genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data for wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), we have identified and annotated the entire 'serpinome' of wheat and constructed a high-quality and robust phylogenetic tree of the gene family, identifying paralogous and homeologous clades from the hexaploid wheat genome, including the Serpin-Z group that have been well characterized in barley. Using publicly available RNAseq data (http://www.wheat-expression.com/), expression profiles of the wheat serpins were explored across a variety of tissues from the developing grain, spikelet and spike. We show that the SERPIN-Z clade, among others, are highly expressed during grain development, and that there is homeologous and paralogous functional redundancy in this gene family. Further to their role in grain development, serpins play an important but under-explored role in response to fungal pathogens. Using 13 RNAseq datasets of wheat tissues infected by fungal pathogens, we identified 37 serpins with a significant disease response. The majority of the disease-responsive serpins were upregulated by Fusarium graminearum , a destructive fungal pathogen that attacks the spike and developing grain of wheat. As serpins are ubiquitous in wheat grain, the genes encoding serpins may be linked to grain development, with their disease response a result of pleiotropy."

"15340684","abstracttext","Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.,2n=6x=42) is an allohexaploid composed of three closely related genomes, designated A, B, and D. Genetic analysis in wheat is complicated, as most genes are present in triplicated sets located in the same chromosomal regions of homoeologous chromosomes. The goal of this report was to use genomic information gathered from wheat-rice sequence comparison to develop genome-specific primer sets for five genes involved in starch biosynthesis. Intron locations in wheat were inferred through the alignment of wheat cDNA sequences with rice genomic sequence.Exon-anchored primers, which amplify across introns,allowed the sequencing of introns from the three genomes for each gene. Sequence variation within introns among the three wheat genomes provided the basis for genome-specific primer design. For three genes, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (Agp-L), sucrose transporter (SUT),and waxy (Wx), genome-specific primer sets were developed for all three genomes. Genome-specific primers were developed for two of the three genomes for Agp-S and starch synthase I (Ssl). Thus, 13 of 15 possible genome-specific primer sets were developed using this strategy. Seven genome-specific primer combinations were used to amplify alleles in hexaploid wheat lines for sequence comparison. Three single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) were identified in a comparison of 5,093 bp among a minimum of ten wheat accessions. Two of theseSNPs could be converted into cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) markers. Our results indicated that the design of genome-specific primer sets using intron-based sequence differences has a high probability of success, while the identification of polymorphism among alleles within a genome may be a challenge."

"16260753","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) accumulates benzoxazinones (Bxs) as defensive compounds. Previously, we found that five Bx biosynthetic genes, TaBx1-TaBx5, are located on each of the three genomes (A, B, and D) of hexaploid wheat. In this study, we isolated three homoeologous cDNAs of each TaBx gene to estimate the contribution of individual homoeologous TaBx genes to the biosynthesis of Bxs in hexaploid wheat. We analyzed their transcript levels by homoeolog- or genome-specific quantitative RT-PCR and the catalytic properties of their translation products by kinetic analyses using recombinant TaBX enzymes. The three homoeologs were transcribed differentially, and the ratio of the individual homoeologous transcripts to total homoeologous transcripts also varied with the tissue, i.e., shoots or roots, as well as with the developmental stage. Moreover, the translation products of the three homoeologs had different catalytic properties. Some TaBx homoeologs were efficiently transcribed, but the translation products showed only weak enzymatic activities, which inferred their weak contribution to Bx biosynthesis. Considering the transcript levels and the catalytic properties collectively, we concluded that the homoeologs on the B genome generally contributed the most to the Bx biosynthesis in hexaploid wheat, especially in shoots. In tetraploid wheat and the three diploid progenitors of hexaploid wheat, the respective transcript levels of the TaBx homoeologs were similar in ratio to those observed in hexaploid wheat. This result indicates that the genomic bias in the transcription of the TaBx genes in hexaploid wheat originated in the diploid progenitors and has been retained through the polyploidization."

"21220762","abstracttext","Barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) possess significant phytase activity in the mature grains. Maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) possess little or virtually no preformed phytase activity in the mature grain and depend fully on de novo synthesis during germination. Here, it is demonstrated that wheat, barley, maize, and rice all possess purple acid phosphatase (PAP) genes that, expressed in Pichia pastoris, give fully functional phytases (PAPhys) with very similar enzyme kinetics. Preformed wheat PAPhy was localized to the protein crystalloid of the aleurone vacuole. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that PAPhys possess four conserved domains unique to the PAPhys. In barley and wheat, the PAPhy genes can be grouped as PAPhy_a or PAPhy_b isogenes (barley, HvPAPhy_a, HvPAPhy_b1, and HvPAPhy_b2; wheat, TaPAPhy_a1, TaPAPhy_a2, TaPAPhy_b1, and TaPAPhy_b2). In rice and maize, only the b type (OsPAPhy_b and ZmPAPhy_b, respectively) were identified. HvPAPhy_a and HvPAPhy_b1/b2 share 86% and TaPAPhya1/a2 and TaPAPhyb1/b2 share up to 90% (TaPAPhy_a2 and TaPAPhy_b2) identical amino acid sequences. despite of this, PAPhy_a and PAPhy_b isogenes are differentially expressed during grain development and germination. In wheat, it was demonstrated that a and b isogene expression is driven by different promoters (approximately 31% identity). TaPAPhy_a/b promoter reporter gene expression in transgenic grains and peptide mapping of TaPAPhy purified from wheat bran and germinating grains confirmed that the PAPhy_a isogene set present in wheat/barley but not in rice/maize is the origin of high phytase activity in mature grains."

"25112202","abstracttext_key message","Identification of novel resistance QTL against wheat aphids. First QTL-resistance report for R. padi in wheat and chromosome 2DL for S. graminum . These sources have potential use in wheat breeding. The aphids Rhopalosiphum padi and Schizaphis graminum are important pests of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Characterization of the genetic bases of resistance sources is crucial to facilitate the development of resistant wheat cultivars to these insects. We examined 140 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross of Seri M82 wheat (susceptible) with the synthetic hexaploid wheat CWI76364 (resistant). RILs were phenotyped for R. padi antibiosis and tolerance traits. Phenotyping of S. graminum resistance was based on leaf chlorosis in a greenhouse screening and the number of S. graminum/tiller in the field. RILs were also scored for pubescence. Using a sequence-based genotyping method, we located genomic regions associated with these resistance traits. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for R. padi antibiosis (QRp.slu.4BL) that explained 10.2 % of phenotypic variation was found in chromosome 4BL and located 14.6 cM apart from the pubescence locus. We found no association between plant pubescence and the resistance traits. We found two QTLs for R. padi tolerance (QRp.slu.5AL and QRp.slu.5BL) in chromosomes 5AL and 5BL, with an epistatic interaction between a locus in chromosome 3AL (EnQRp.slu.5AL) and QRp.slu.5AL. These genomic regions explained about 35 % of the phenotypic variation. We re-mapped a previously reported gene for S. graminum resistance (putatively Gba) in 7DL and found a novel QTL associated with the number of aphids/tiller (QGb.slu-2DL) in chromosome 2DL. This is the first report on the genetic mapping of R. padi resistance in wheat and the first report where chromosome 2DL is shown to be associated with S. graminum resistance."

"26047019","abstracttext","ERECTA encodes a receptor-like kinase and is proposed as a candidate for determining transpiration efficiency of plants. Two genes homologous to ERECTA in Arabidopsis were identified on chromosomes 6 (TaER2) and 7 (TaER1) of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), with copies of each gene on the A, B and D genomes of wheat. Similar expression patterns were observed for TaER1 and TaER2 with relatively higher expression of TaER1 in flag leaves of wheat at heading (Z55) and grain-filling (Z73) stages. Significant variations were found in the expression levels of both TaER1 and TaER2 in the flag leaves at both growth stages among 48 diverse bread wheat varieties. Based on the expression of TaER1 and TaER2, the 48 wheat varieties could be classified into three groups having high (5 varieties), medium (27 varieties) and low (16 varieties) levels of TaER expression. Significant differences were also observed between the three groups varying for TaER expression for several transpiration efficiency (TE)- related traits, including stomatal density (SD), transpiration rate, photosynthetic rate (A), instant water use efficiency (WUEi) and carbon isotope discrimination (CID), and yield traits of biomass production plant-1 (BYPP) and grain yield plant-1 (GYPP). Correlation analysis revealed that the expression of TaER1 and TaER2 at the two growth stages was significantly and negatively associated with SD (P<0.01), transpiration rate (P<0.05) and CID (P<0.01), while significantly and positively correlated with flag leaf area (FLA, P<0.01), A (P<0.05), WUEi (P<0.05), BYPP (P<0.01) and GYPP (P<0.01), with stronger correlations for TaER1 than TaER2 and at grain-filling stage than at heading stage. These combined results suggested that TaER involved in development of transpiration efficiency -related traits and yield in bread wheat, implying a function for TaER in regulating leaf development of bread wheat and contributing to expression of these traits. Moreover, the results indicate that TaER could be exploitable for manipulating important agronomical traits in wheat improvement."

"28959271","abstracttext","The protein content and its type are principal factors affecting wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) end product quality. Among the wheat proteins, glutenin proteins, especially, high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are major determinants of processing quality. Wheat and its primary gene pool have limited variation in terms of HMW-GS alleles. Wild relatives of wheat are an important source of genetic variation. For improvement of wheat processing quality its wild relative Thinopyrum elongatum with significant potential was utilized. An attempt was made to replace Th. elongatum chromosome long arm (1EL) carrying HMW-GS genes related to high dough strength with chromosome 1AL of wheat with least or negative effect on dough strength while retaining the chromosomes 1DL and 1BL with a positive effect on bread making quality. To create chromosome specific translocation line [1EL(1AS)], double monosomic of chromosomes 1E and 1A were created and further crossed with different cultivars and homoeologous pairing suppressor mutant line Ph I . The primary selection was based upon glutenin and gliadin protein profiles, followed by sequential genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). These steps significantly reduced time, efforts, and economic cost in the generation of translocation line. In order to assess the effect of translocation on wheat quality, background recovery was carried out by backcrossing with recurrent parent for several generations and then selfing while selecting in each generation. Good recovery of parent background indicated the development of almost near isogenic line (NIL). Morphologically also translocation line was similar to recipient cultivar N61 that was further confirmed by seed storage protein profiles, RP-HPLC and scanning electron microscopy. The processing quality characteristics of translocation line (BC 4 F 6 ) indicated significant improvement in the gluten performance index (GPI), dough mixing properties, dough strength, and extensibility. Our work aims to address the challenge of limited genetic diversity especially at chromosome 1A HMW-GS locus. We report successful development of chromosome 1A specific translocation line of Th. elongatum in wheat with improved dough strength."

"29124282","abstracttext_key message","A complete set of six compensating Robertsonian translocation chromosomes involving barley chromosome 7H and three chromosomes of hexaploid wheat was produced. Grain β-glucan content increased in lines containing 7HL. Many valuable genes for agronomic performance, disease resistance and increased yield have been transferred from relative species to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) through whole-arm Robertsonian translocations (RobT). Although of a great value, the sets of available translocations from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) are limited. Here, we present the production of a complete set of six compensating RobT chromosomes involving barley chromosome 7H and three group-7 chromosomes of wheat. The barley group-7 long-arm RobTs had a higher grain β-glucan content compared to the wheat control. The β-glucan levels varied depending on the temperature and were higher under hot conditions. Implicated in this increase, the barley cellulose synthase-like F6 gene (CslF6) responsible for β-glucan synthesis was physically mapped near the centromere in the long arm of barley chromosome 7H. Likewise, wheat CslF6 homoeologs were mapped near the centromere in the long arms of all group-7 wheat chromosomes. With the set of novel wheat-barley translocations, we demonstrate a valuable increase of β-glucan, along with a resource of genetic stocks that are likely to carry many other important genes from barley into wheat."

"28676817","abstracttext","Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is a major crop worldwide. The utilization of heterosis is a promising approach to improve the yield and quality of wheat. Although there have been many studies on wheat cytoplasmic male sterility, its mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we identified two MADS-box genes from a wheat K-type cytoplasmic male sterile (CMS) line using homology-based cloning. These genes were localized on wheat chromosomes 3A and 3B and named TaAG-A and TaAG-B , respectively. Analysis of TaAG-A and TaAG-B expression patterns in leaves, spikes, roots, and stems of Chinese Spring wheat determined using quantitative RT-PCR revealed different expression levels in different tissues. TaAG-A had relatively high expression levels in leaves and spikes, but low levels in roots, while TaAG-B had relatively high expression levels in spikes and lower expression in roots, stems, and leaves. Both genes showed downregulation during the mononucleate to trinucleate stages of pollen development in the maintainer line. In contrast, upregulation of TaAG-B was observed in the CMS line. The transcript levels of the two genes were clearly higher in the CMS line compared to the maintainer line at the trinucleate stage. Overexpression of TaAG-A and TaAG-B in Arabidopsis resulted in phenotypes with earlier reproductive development, premature mortality, and abnormal buds, stamens, and stigmas. Overexpression of TaAG-A and TaAG-B gives rise to mutants with many deformities. Silencing TaAG-A and TaAG-B in a fertile wheat line using the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) method resulted in plants with green and yellow striped leaves, emaciated spikes, and decreased selfing seed set rates. These results demonstrate that TaAG-A and TaAG-B may play a role in male sterility in the wheat CMS line."

"30298074","abstracttext","The TCP family genes are plant-specific transcription factors and play important roles in plant development. TCPs have been evolutionarily and functionally studied in several plants. Although common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is a major staple crop worldwide, no systematic analysis of TCPs in this important crop has been conducted. Here, we performed a genome-wide survey in wheat and found 66 TCP genes that belonged to 22 homoeologous groups. We then mapped these genes on wheat chromosomes and found that several TCP genes were duplicated in wheat including the ortholog of the maize TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 . Expression study using both RT-PCR and in situ hybridization assay showed that most wheat TCP genes were expressed throughout development of young spike and immature seed. Cis -acting element survey along promoter regions suggests that subfunctionalization may have occurred for homoeologous genes. Moreover, protein-protein interaction experiments of three TCP proteins showed that they can form either homodimers or heterodimers. Finally, we characterized two TaTCP9 mutants from tetraploid wheat. Each of these two mutant lines contained a premature stop codon in the A subgenome homoeolog that was dominantly expressed over the B subgenome homoeolog. We observed that mutation caused increased spike and grain lengths. Together, our analysis of the wheat TCP gene family provides a start point for further functional study of these important transcription factors in wheat."

"16076109","abstracttext","Qualitative and quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) systems aimed at the specific detection and quantification of common wheat DNA are described. Many countries have issued regulations to label foods that include genetically modified organisms (GMOs). PCR technology is widely recognized as a reliable and useful technique for the qualitative and quantitative detection of GMOs. Detection methods are needed to amplify a target GM gene, and the amplified results should be compared with those of the corresponding taxon-specific reference gene to obtain reliable results. This paper describes the development of a specific DNA sequence in the waxy-D1 gene for common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the design of a specific primer pair and TaqMan probe on the waxy-D1 gene for PCR analysis. The primers amplified a product (Wx012) of 102 bp. It is indicated that the Wx012 DNA sequence is specific to common wheat, showing homogeneity in qualitative PCR results and very similar quantification accuracy along 19 distantly related common wheat varieties. In Southern blot and real-time PCR analyses, this sequence showed either a single or a low number of copy genes. In addition, by qualitative and quantitative PCR using wx012 primers and a wx012-T probe, the limits of detection of the common wheat genome were found to be about 15 copies, and the reproducibility was reliable. In consequence, the PCR system using wx012 primers and wx012-T probe is considered to be suitable for use as a common wheat-specific taxon-specific reference gene in DNA analyses, including GMO tests."

"31377817","abstracttext_key message","Novel large-effect consistent QTL for anther extrusion (AE) to improve cross-pollination were mapped in doubled haploid populations derived from IPK gene bank spring wheat accessions. TaAP2-D, an ortholog of Cleistogamy1 in barley, is a likely candidate gene for AE in wheat. To establish a robust hybrid wheat breeding system, male lines harboring alleles that promote outcrossing should be developed. In this study, we developed two doubled haploid (DH) populations of hexaploid spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by crossing accessions taken from IPK gene bank. In both populations, the phenotypic data of anther extrusion (AE) based on three years of field trials showed a wide variation and approximated a normal distribution. Both populations were genotyped with a 15 k Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array resulting in 3567 and 3457 polymorphic SNP markers for DH population-1 and DH population-2, respectively. Composite interval mapping identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 1D, 2D, 4A, 4B, 5A, 5D, 6A, and 6B; with consistent QTL (that are identified in all the years) on chromosome 4A in DH population-1, and on chromosomes 2D and 6B in DH population-2. The consistent QTL explained 17.2%, 32.9%, and 12.3% of the phenotypic variances, respectively. Genic scan of the chromosome 2D-QTL showed that the wheat gene TaAP2-D, an ortholog of Cleistogamy1 which promotes AE via swelling of the lodicules in barley, lies within the QTL region. A diagnostic marker was developed for TaAP2-D that showed co-segregation with the AE phenotype. This study shows the use of gene bank diversity reservoir to find alleles which are otherwise difficult to detect in elite populations. The identification of large-effect consistent QTL for AE is expected to help form efficient male parental lines suitable for hybrid wheat seed production and serve as a source for map-based cloning."

"18705849","abstracttext","Stripe rust [caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks. (Pst)] is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Genetic resistance is the preferred method for control and the Yr5 gene, originally identified in Triticum spelta var. album, represents a major resistance (R) gene that confers all-stage resistance to all currently known races of Pst in the United States. To identify transcripts associated with the Yr5-mediated incompatible interaction and the yr5-compatible interaction, the Wheat GeneChip was used to profile the changes occurring in wheat isolines that differed for the presence of the Yr5 gene after inoculation with Pst. This time-course study (6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-inoculation) identified 115 transcripts that were induced during the R-gene-mediated incompatible interaction, and 73 induced during the compatible interaction. Fifty-four transcripts were induced in both interactions and were considered as basal defence transcripts, whilst 61 transcripts were specific to the incompatible interaction [hypersensitive response (HR)-specific transcripts] and 19 were specific to the compatible interaction (biotrophic interaction-specific transcripts). The temporal pattern of transcript accumulation showed a peak at 24 h after infection that may reflect haustorial penetration by Pst at ~16 h. An additional 12 constitutive transcript differences were attributed to the presence of Yr5 after eliminating those considered as incomplete isogenicity. Annotation of the induced transcripts revealed that the presence of Yr5 resulted in a rapid and amplified resistance response involving signalling pathways and defence-related transcripts known to occur during R-gene-mediated responses, including protein kinase signalling and the production of reactive oxygen species leading to a hypersensitive response. Basal defence also involved substantial induction of many defence-related transcripts but the lack of R-gene signalling resulted in weaker response."

"28255671","abstracttext_key message","A novel powdery mildew-resistance gene, designated Pm58, was introgressed directly from Aegilops tauschii to hexaploid wheat, mapped to chromosome 2DS, and confirmed to be effective under field conditions. Selectable KASP™ markers were developed for MAS. Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) f. sp. tritici (Bgt) remains a significant threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. The rapid breakdown of race-specific resistance to Bgt reinforces the need to identify novel sources of resistance. The D-genome species, Aegilops tauschii, is an excellent source of disease resistance that is transferrable to T. aestivum. The powdery mildew-resistant Ae. tauschii accession TA1662 (2n = 2x = DD) was crossed directly with the susceptible hard white wheat line KS05HW14 (2n = 6x = AABBDD) followed by backcrossing to develop a population of 96 BC 2 F 4 introgression lines (ILs). Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to develop a genome-wide genetic map that was anchored to the Ae. tauschii reference genome. A detached-leaf Bgt assay was used to screen BC 2 F 4:6 ILs, and resistance was found to segregate as a single locus (χ = 2.0, P value = 0.157). The resistance gene, referred to as Pm58, mapped to chromosome 2DS. Pm58 was evaluated under field conditions in replicated trials in 2015 and 2016. In both years, a single QTL spanning the Pm58 locus was identified that reduced powdery mildew severity and explained 21% of field variation (P value < 0.01). KASP™ assays were developed from closely linked GBS-SNP markers, a refined genetic map was developed, and four markers that cosegregate with Pm58 were identified. This novel source of powdery mildew-resistance and closely linked genetic markers will support efforts to develop wheat varieties with powdery mildew resistance."

"30821405","abstracttext","Taxonomically-restricted orphan genes play an important role in environmental adaptation, as recently demonstrated by the fact that the Pooideae-specific orphan TaFROG (Triticum aestivum Fusarium Resistance Orphan Gene) enhanced wheat resistance to the economically devastating Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease. Like most orphan genes, little is known about the cellular function of the encoded protein TaFROG, other than it interacts with the central stress regulator TaSnRK1α. Here, we functionally characterized a wheat (T. aestivum) NAC-like transcription factor TaNACL-D1 that interacts with TaFROG and investigated its' role in FHB using studies to assess motif analyses, yeast transactivation, protein-protein interaction, gene expression and the disease response of wheat lines overexpressing TaNACL-D1. TaNACL-D1 is a Poaceae-divergent NAC transcription factor that encodes a Triticeae-specific protein C-terminal region with transcriptional activity and a nuclear localisation signal. The TaNACL-D1/TaFROG interaction was detected in yeast and confirmed in planta, within the nucleus. Analysis of multi-protein interactions indicated that TaFROG could form simultaneously distinct protein complexes with TaNACL-D1 and TaSnRK1α in planta. TaNACL-D1 and TaFROG are co-expressed as an early response to both the causal fungal agent of FHB, Fusarium graminearum and its virulence factor deoxynivalenol (DON). Wheat lines overexpressing TaNACL-D1 were more resistant to FHB disease than wild type plants. Thus, we conclude that the orphan protein TaFROG interacts with TaNACL-D1, a NAC transcription factor that forms part of the disease response evolved within the Triticeae."
"11891237","articletitle","Gene-containing regions of wheat and the other grass genomes."
"11891237","abstracttext","Deletion line-based high-density physical maps revealed that the wheat (Triticum aestivum) genome is partitioned into gene-rich and -poor compartments. Available deletion lines have bracketed the gene-containing regions to about 10% of the genome. Emerging sequence data suggest that these may further be partitioned into ""mini"" gene-rich and gene-poor regions. An average of about 10% of each gene-rich region seem to contain genes. Sequence analyses in various species suggest that uneven distribution of genes may be a characteristic of all grasses and perhaps all higher organisms. Comparison of the physical maps with genetic linkage maps showed that recombination in wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare) is confined to the gene-containing regions. Number of genes, gene density, and the extent of recombination vary greatly among the gene-rich regions. The gene order, relative region size, and recombination are highly conserved within the tribe Triticeae and moderately conserved within the family. Gene-poor regions are composed of retrotransposon-like non-transcribing repeats and pseudogenes. Direct comparisons of orthologous regions indicated that gene density in wheat is about one-half compared with rice (Oryza sativa). Genome size difference between wheat and rice is, therefore, mainly because of amplification of the gene-poor regions. Presence of species-, genera-, and family-specific repeats reveal a repeated invasion of the genomes by different retrotransposons over time. Preferential transposition to adjacent locations and presence of vital genes flanking a gene-rich region may have restricted retrotransposon amplification to gene-poor regions, resulting into tandem blocks of non-transcribing repeats. Insertional inactivation by adjoining retro-elements and selection seem to have played a major role in stabilizing genomes."

"9880349","abstracttext","Cereal aleurone responses to gibberellic acid (GA3) include activation of synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes and acidification of the external medium. We have studied the effect of the pH of the incubation medium on the response of wheat (Triticum aestivum) aleurone cells to GA3. De-embryonated half grains show the capacity for GA3-activated medium acidification when incubation is carried out at pH 6.0 to 7.0 but not at lower pHs. In addition, the activating effect of GA3 on the expression of carboxypeptidase III and thiol protease genes is more efficient when the hormone treatment is carried out at neutral pH. In situ pH staining showed that starchy endosperm acidification takes place upon imbibition and advances from the embryo to the distal part of the grain. In situ hybridization experiments showed a similar pattern of expression of a carboxypeptidase III gene, which is up-regulated by GA3 in aleurone cells. However, aleurone gene expression precedes starchy endosperm acidification. These findings imply that in vivo GA perception by the aleurone layer takes place at neutral pH and suggest that the acidification of the starchy endosperm is regulated by GA3 in germinated wheat grains."

"9847089","abstracttext","Both high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) play the major role in determining the viscoelastic properties of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour. To date there has been no clear correspondence between the amino acid sequences of LMW-GS derived from DNA sequencing and those of actual LMW-GS present in the endosperm. We have characterized a particular LMW-GS from hexaploid bread wheat, a major component of the glutenin polymer, which we call the 42K LMW-GS, and have isolated and sequenced the putative corresponding gene. Extensive amino acid sequences obtained directly for this 42K LMW-GS indicate correspondence between this protein and the putative corresponding gene. This subunit did not show a cysteine (Cys) at position 5, in contrast to what has frequently been reported for nucleotide-based sequences of LMW-GS. This Cys has been replaced by one occurring in the repeated-sequence domain, leaving the total number of Cys residues in the molecule the same as in various other LMW-GS. On the basis of the deduced amino acid sequence and literature-based assignment of disulfide linkages, a computer-generated molecular model of the 42K subunit was constructed."

"11135114","abstracttext","The proportion of alpha-linolenic acid (18:3) among the total fatty acids in root tissue increases as the growth temperature decreases. Endoplasmic reticulum omega-3 fatty acid desaturase is responsible for the production of most of the 18:3 in root tissue. In this study, the effect of temperature on expression of the TaFAD3 gene, which encodes endoplasmic reticulum omega-3 desaturase in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chihoku), was analysed at the mRNA and protein levels. In wheat root tips grown at 30 and 10 degrees C, the proportions of 18:3 among total fatty acids were 22% and 55%, respectively. The level of TaFAD3 protein in microsomal preparations of the root tips grown at 10 degrees C was approximately 7.5 times higher than that of the root tips grown at 30 degrees C. The increased level of TaFAD3 protein at the lower temperature was accompanied by enhanced association of TaFAD3 mRNA with polyribosomes. In contrast, the level of TaFAD3 mRNA in root tips grown at 10 degrees C was slightly higher than in those grown at 30 degrees C. These results suggest that, in root tips, the increase in the 18:3 level at low temperature is achieved directly by an increase in the amount of TaFAD3 protein, and that temperature-dependent translational regulation of the TaFAD3 gene, rather than its transcriptional regulation, contributes to modulation of the TaFAD3 protein accumulation."
"12376648","articletitle","The abscisic acid-responsive kinase PKABA1 interacts with a seed-specific abscisic acid response element-binding factor, TaABF, and phosphorylates TaABF peptide sequences."
"12376648","abstracttext","The abscisic acid (ABA)-induced protein kinase PKABA1 is present in dormant seeds and is a component of the signal transduction pathway leading to ABA-suppressed gene expression in cereal grains. We have identified a member of the ABA response element-binding factor (ABF) family of basic leucine zipper transcription factors from wheat (Triticum aestivum) that is specifically bound by PKABA1. This protein (TaABF) has highest sequence similarity to the Arabidopsis ABA response protein ABI5. In two-hybrid assays TaABF bound only to PKABA1, but not to a mutant version of PKABA1 lacking the nucleotide binding domain, suggesting that binding of TaABF requires prior binding of ATP as would be expected for binding of a protein substrate by a protein kinase. TaABF mRNA accumulated together with PKABA1 mRNA during wheat grain maturation and dormancy acquisition and TaABF transcripts increased transiently during imbibition of dormant grains. In contrast to PKABA1 mRNA, TaABF mRNA is seed specific and did not accumulate in vegetative tissues in response to stress or ABA application. PKABA1 produced in transformed cell lines was able to phosphorylate synthetic peptides representing three specific regions of TaABF. These data suggest that TaABF may serve as a physiological substrate for PKABA1 in the ABA signal transduction pathway during grain maturation, dormancy expression, and ABA-suppressed gene expression."

"15166159","abstracttext","Resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) to the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), a major insect pest of wheat, is based on a gene-for-gene interaction. Close linkage (3 +/- 2 cM) was discovered between Hessian fly avirulence genes vH3 and vH5. Bulked segregant analysis revealed two DNA markers (28-178 and 23-201) within 10 cM of these loci and only 3 +/- 2 cM apart. However, 28-178 was located in the middle of the short arm of Hessian fly chromosome A2 whereas 23-201 was located in the middle of the long arm of chromosome A2, suggesting the presence of severe recombination suppression over its proximal region. To further test that possibility, an AFLP-based genetic map of the Hessian fly genome was constructed. Fluorescence in situ hybridization of 20 markers on the genetic map to the polytene chromosomes of the Hessian fly indicated good correspondence between the linkage groups and the four Hessian fly chromosomes. The physically anchored genetic map is the first of any gall midge species. The proximal region of mitotic chromosome A2 makes up 30% of its length but corresponded to <3% of the chromosome A2 genetic map."

"15454553","abstracttext","Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping is based on radiation-induced chromosome breakage and analysis of chromosome segment retention or loss using molecular markers. In durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L., AABB), an alloplasmic durum line [(lo) durum] has been identified with chromosome 1D of T. aestivum L. (AABBDD) carrying the species cytoplasm-specific (scsae) gene. The chromosome 1D of this line segregates as a whole without recombination, precluding the use of conventional genome mapping. A radiation hybrid mapping population was developed from a hemizygous (lo) scsae--line using 35 krad gamma rays. The analysis of 87 individuals of this population with 39 molecular markers mapped on chromosome 1D revealed 88 radiation-induced breaks in this chromosome. This number of chromosome 1D breaks is eight times higher than the number of previously identified breaks and should result in a 10-fold increase in mapping resolution compared to what was previously possible. The analysis of molecular marker retention in our radiation hybrid mapping panel allowed the localization of scsae and 8 linked markers on the long arm of chromosome 1D. This constitutes the first report of using RH mapping to localize a gene in wheat and illustrates that this approach is feasible in a species with a large complex genome."

"16199615","abstracttext","The plant pathogenic fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis secretes host-selective toxins (HSTs) that function as pathogenicity factors. Unlike most HSTs that are products of enzymatic pathways, at least two toxins produced by P. tritici-repentis are proteins and, thus, products of single genes. Sensitivity to these toxins in the host is conferred by a single gene for each toxin. To study the site of action of Ptr ToxA (ToxA), toxin-sensitive and -insensitive wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars were treated with ToxA followed by proteinase K. ToxA was resistant to protease, but only in sensitive leaves, suggesting that ToxA is either protected from the protease by association with a receptor or internalized. Immunolocalization and green fluorescent protein tagged ToxA localization demonstrate that ToxA is internalized in sensitive wheat cultivars only. Once internalized, ToxA localizes to cytoplasmic compartments and to chloroplasts. Intracellular expression of ToxA by biolistic bombardment into both toxin-sensitive and -insensitive cells results in cell death, suggesting that the ToxA internal site of action is present in both cell types. However, because ToxA is internalized only in sensitive cultivars, toxin sensitivity, and therefore the ToxA sensitivity gene, are most likely related to protein import. The results of this study show that the ToxA protein is capable of crossing the plant plasma membrane from the apoplastic space to the interior of the plant cell in the absence of a pathogen."

P 9072] were grown in field under atmospheric (360 +/- 10 cm3 m(-3), AC) and elevated (650 +/- 50 cm3 m(-3), EC) CO2 concentrations in open top chambers for entire period of growth and development. Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 was examined by comparing photosynthesis rate (Pn), Pn/Ci curves, leaf contents of RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco), change in the transcripts of Rubisco small subunit (SSU) gene and leaf carbohydrate constituents in AC and EC grown plants. The study indicated that photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO2 concentration in wheat occurred because of down regulation of Rubisco, through limitation imposed on Rubisco SSU gene expression, as a consequence of sugar accumulation in the leaves. Leaf starch accumulators, sunflower and mungbean, showed no down regulation of Pn under EC. The Rubisco contents (%) in leaf soluble protein and rbcS transcript levels were not significantly affected in EC plants compared to AC plants of sunflower and mungbean. The study indicated that accumulation of excess assimilates in the leaves as starch was less inhibitory to Pn and would, therefore, be an important trait for sustenance of Pn not only under EC, but also under AC, where Pn inhibited by end products."

"18943783","abstracttext","ABSTRACT The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Mexico, germplasm-derived wheat (Triticum aestivum) Kavkaz-K4500 L.6.A.4 (KK) is one of the major sources of resistance to Septoria tritici blotch (STB). KK is resistant to STB in field conditions in the UK even though a large majority of Mycosphaerella graminicola isolates are virulent to it. The genetics of the resistance of KK to four isolates of M. graminicola were investigated. KK has at least five isolate-specific resistance genes including Stb6 on chromosome 3A plus a second gene for resistance to isolate IPO323, two genes on chromosome 4A, both in the region where Stb7 is located with one designated as Stb12, and a gene designated Stb10 on chromosome 1D. Taken together, the widespread use of KK as a source of resistance to STB, its high resistance in field conditions, and its high susceptibility to M. graminicola isolates, which are virulent to all its resistance genes, suggest that high levels of field resistance to STB might be achieved by pyramiding several isolate-specific resistance genes."

"16593753","abstracttext","Several aneuploid lines and one intervarietal substitution line of the hexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum (2n = 6x = 42; genomes AABBDD) cv. Chinese Spring were used to study the effects of different doses of chromosomes 1B, 1D, or 1A on the amount of the high molecular weight (""HMW"") glutenins and gliadins of endosperm. These homeologous chromosomes carry HMW glutenin and gliadin gene clusters on their long and short arms, respectively. Increasing the dosage of chromosome 1B of Chinese Spring in plants having in their 3n endosperm zero or the normal three doses of the homeologue 1D, as well as in plants carrying in their endosperm one dose of 1B of the cultivar Timstein, had a dual effect: on one hand, a nonlinear increase in the amount of each subunit encoded by the chromosome whose dosage was elevated and, on the other hand, a compensating nonspecific decrease in the amount of other HMW glutenin and gliadin subunits encoded either by the homeoalleles on 1D or by the homoalleles on 1B of Timstein, respectively. Deletion of chromosome arm 1BL, which carries only a few HMW glutenin genes, had no significant effect on the amount of HMW glutenins encoded by 1DL and HMW gliadins encoded by 1DS and 1BS. However, deletion of 1BS or 1DS, each carrying many gliadin genes, caused a significant but nonspecific increase in the HMW glutenins and gliadins encoded by the remaining arms of 1B and 1D. The possible mechanism and evolutionary implications of gene-dosage compensation in polyploid wheat are discussed."

"16668253","abstracttext","The four major components of the wheat monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors (WMAI) from wheat, Triticum aestivum, endosperm have been isolated and characterized. Two of them, WMAI-1 and WMAI-2, are highly active against the alpha-amylase from the insect Tenebrio molitor and their N-terminal amino acid sequences indicate that they are closely related to each other (86% identical residues) and to the other members of the family (subunits of dimeric and tetrameric alpha-amylase inhibitors and trypsin inhibitors). WMAI-1, which is identical to the previously described 0.28 inhibitor, is encoded by a gene located in the short arm of chromosome 6D and WMAI-2 by a gene in the short arm of chromosome 6B. Components 3 and 4, which have blocked N-terminal residues, have identical internal amino acid sequences and are a separate class of proteins with respect to WMAI-1 and WMAI-2, although their amino acid composition and apparent molecular weights are quite similar. Their inhibitory activity versus alpha-amylases is either unstable during the purification process or due to contamination with other inhibitors."

"22010107","abstracttext","Dominance, semidominance, and recessiveness are important modes of Mendelian inheritance. The phytohormone gibberellin (GA) regulates many plant growth and developmental processes. The previously cloned semidominant GA-insensitive (GAI) genes Reduced height1 (Rht1) and Rht2 in wheat (Triticum aestivum) were the basis of the Green Revolution. However, no completely dominant GAI gene has been cloned. Here, we report the molecular characterization of Rht-B1c, a dominant GAI allele in wheat that confers more extreme characteristics than its incompletely dominant alleles. Rht-B1c is caused by a terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature insertion in the DELLA domain. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that Rht-B1c protein fails to interact with GA-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1), thereby blocking GA responses and resulting in extreme dwarfism and pleiotropic effects. By contrast, Rht-B1b protein only reduces interaction with GID1. Furthermore, we analyzed its functions using near-isogenic lines and examined its molecular mechanisms in transgenic rice. These results indicated that the affinity between GID1 and DELLA proteins is key to regulation of the stability of DELLA proteins, and differential interactions determine dominant and semidominant gene responses to GA."

APX induction in infected resistant genotypes was similar and higher than in the susceptible control. The introgression wheat/Aegilops ventricosa H-93-8 line, carrying the Cre2 gene, and its parental line H-10-15 as susceptible control were used to analyze whether this increase of activity was correlated with the induction of APX gene expression. Genes encoding cytosolic forms of APX were induced in roots of both lines in response to nematode infection. This induction took place both earlier and with greater intensity in the resistant line than in the susceptible one, and it was also higher in the root area at the site of nematode attachment."

To facilitate the visualisation of stromules on different plastid types in various tissues of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a chimeric gene construct encoding enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) targeted to plastids with the transit peptide of wheat granule-bound starch synthase I was introduced by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The gene construct was under the control of the rice Actin1 promoter, and EYFP fluorescence was detected in plastids in all cell types throughout the transgenic plants. Stromules were observed on all plastid types, although the stromule length and abundance varied markedly in different tissues. The longest stromules (up to 40 μm) were observed in epidermal cells of leaves, whereas only short beak-like stromules were observed on chloroplasts in mesophyll cells. Epidermal cells in leaves and roots contained the highest proportion of plastids with stromules, and stromules were also abundant on amyloplasts in the endosperm tissue of developing seeds. The general features of stromule morphology and distribution were similar to those shown previously for tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) and arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh.)."

"23845012","abstracttext","The slow vacuolar (SV) channel has been characterized in different dicots by patch-clamp recordings. This channel represents the major cation conductance of the largest organelle in most plant cells. Studies with the tpc1-2 mutant of the model dicot plant Arabidopsis thaliana identified the SV channel as the product of the TPC1 gene. By contrast, research on rice and wheat TPC1 suggested that the monocot gene encodes a plasma membrane calcium-permeable channel. To explore the site of action of grass TPC1 channels, we expressed OsTPC1 from rice (Oryza sativa) and TaTPC1 from wheat (Triticum aestivum) in the background of the Arabidopsis tpc1-2 mutant. Cross-species tpc1 complementation and patch-clamping of vacuoles using Arabidopsis and rice tpc1 null mutants documented that both monocot TPC1 genes were capable of rescuing the SV channel deficit. Vacuoles from wild-type rice but not the tpc1 loss-of-function mutant harbor SV channels exhibiting the hallmark properties of dicot TPC1/SV channels. When expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells OsTPC1 was targeted to Lysotracker-Red-positive organelles. The finding that the rice TPC1, just like those from the model plant Arabidopsis and even animal cells, is localized and active in lyso-vacuolar membranes associates this cation channel species with endomembrane function."

"24635700","abstracttext","The actin cytoskeleton is involved in plant defense responses; however, the role of the actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) family, which regulates actin cytoskeletal dynamics, in plant disease resistance, is largely unknown. Here, we characterized a wheat (Triticum aestivum) ADF gene, TaADF7, with three copies located on chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D, respectively. All three copies encoded the same protein, although there were variations in 19 nucleotide positions in the open reading frame. Transcriptional expression of the three TaADF7 copies were all sharply elevated in response to avirulent Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) infection, with similar expression patterns. TaADF7 regulated the actin cytoskeletal dynamics by targeting the actin cytoskeleton to execute actin binding/severing activities. When the TaADF7 copies were all silenced by virus-induced gene silencing, the growth of Pst hypha increased and sporadic urediniospores were observed, as compared with control plants, upon inoculation with avirulent Pst. In addition, the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the hypersensitive response (HR) were greatly weakened, whereas cytochalasin B partially rescued the HR in TaADF7 knock-down plants. Together, these findings suggest that TaADF7 is likely to contribute to wheat resistance against Pst infection by modulating the actin cytoskeletal dynamics to influence ROS accumulation and the HR."

"24687459","abstracttext_key message","The antioxidant system was significantly inhibited in the early aging line than the near-isogenic normal aging line during senescence. The antioxidant system plays pivotal roles in removal of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced during leaf senescence. To explore its roles in leaf senescence of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the concentrations of antioxidants, activities, and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes were evaluated in flag leaves of the early aging line (EAL) and the near-isogenic normal aging line (NL) during senescence. The results showed that the total chlorophyll and soluble protein in the EAL declined earlier and faster, while more malondialdehyde and ROS accumulated compared with the NL. The activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, dehydroascorbate reductase, and glutathione reductase were lower in the EAL than in the NL across multiple measuring dates. Additionally, the EAL had less amounts of reduced ascorbate and glutathione as well as lower reduction state with the progression of senescence. Concomitantly, the gene expression of antioxidant enzymes in the EAL was also significantly repressed relative to those in the NL during natural senescence. Taken together, the earlier onset and faster rate of senescence in the EAL could be a result of an imbalance of ROS production and ROS-scavenging antioxidant system, which provided valuable hints toward understanding leaf senescence of wheat."

"24122057","abstracttext","The clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated protein (Cas) system has been used as an efficient tool for genome editing. We report the application of CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome editing to wheat (Triticum aestivum), the most important food crop plant with a very large and complex genome. The mutations were targeted in the inositol oxygenase (inox) and phytoene desaturase (pds) genes using cell suspension culture of wheat and in the pds gene in leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. The expression of chimeric guide RNAs (cgRNA) targeting single and multiple sites resulted in indel mutations in all the tested samples. The expression of Cas9 or sgRNA alone did not cause any mutation. The expression of duplex cgRNA with Cas9 targeting two sites in the same gene resulted in deletion of DNA fragment between the targeted sequences. Multiplexing the cgRNA could target two genes at one time. Target specificity analysis of cgRNA showed that mismatches at the 3' end of the target site abolished the cleavage activity completely. The mismatches at the 5' end reduced cleavage, suggesting that the off target effects can be abolished in vivo by selecting target sites with unique sequences at 3' end. This approach provides a powerful method for genome engineering in plants."

"24186257","abstracttext","Carbon isotope discrimination (Δ) has been suggested as a selection criterion to improve transpiration efficiency (W) in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Cultivars 'Chinese Spring' with low A (high W) and 'Yecora Rojo' with high Δ (low W) were crossed to develop F1, F2, BC1, and BC2 populations for genetic analysis of Δ and other agronomic characters under well-watered (wet) and water-stressed (dry) field conditions. Significant variation was observed among the generations for Δ only under the wet environment. Generation x irrigation interactions were not significant for Δ. Generation means analysis indicated that additive gene action is of primary importance in the expression of Δ under nonstress conditions. Dominance gene action was also detected for Δ, and the direction of dominance was toward higher values of Δ. The broad-sense and the narrow-sense heritabilities for Δ were 61 % and 57% under the wet conditions, but were 48% and 12% under the draughted conditions, respectively. The narrow-sense heritabilities for grain yield, above-ground dry matter, and harvest index were 36%, 39%, and 60% under the wet conditions and 21%, 44%, and 20% under dry conditions, respectively. The significant additive genetic variation and moderate estimate of the narrow-sense heritability observed for Δ indicated that selection under wet environments should be effective in changing Δ in spring bread wheat."

Genes involved in signalling mechanisms such as TaTPD1-like and TAA1b, and two glutathione S-transferase (GSTF2 and GSTA2) were induced when microspores had acquired a 'star-like' morphology or had undergone the first divisions. Genes associated with control of plant development and stress response (TaNF-YA, TaAGL14, TaFLA26, CHI3, XIP-R; Tad1 and WALI6) were activated before exine rupture. When the multicellular structures have been released from the exine, TaEXPB4, TaAGP31-like and an unknown embryo-specific gene TaME1 were induced. Comparison of gene expression, between two wheat cultivars with different response to anther culture, showed that the profile of genes activated before exine rupture was shifted to earlier stages in the low responding cultivar. This collection of genes constitutes a value resource for study mechanism of intra-embryo communication, early pattern formation, cell wall modification and embryo differentiation."

"24816669","abstracttext","Cereal crops, including bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), are an important staple food worldwide. With a growing global population, it is evident that current crop production will not meet the rising demands being placed on modern agriculture. Efforts to improve crop yield and stress-tolerance by traditional breeding are labor intensive, time consuming, and highly dependent upon the ability to capture existing and novel genetic variation from a restricted genetic pool. Genetic engineering of crop species is one of several alternatives to traditional breeding for the introduction of novel genetic variation. This recently established technology has proved useful for the introduction of novel traits like pest resistance and herbicide tolerance. As a universal tool for genetic transformation, the Biolistic Gene Gun allows for the genomic integration of novel gene sequences from various sources into a whole host of living organisms.In this chapter, we present a novel and detailed protocol for the Biolistic Transformation of bread wheat that uses the pharmaceutical compound, Centrophenoxine (CPX). The application of CPX as the main auxin-like plant growth regulator in cereal genetic transformation replaces the potent but more toxic herbicide 2,4-D."
"27474116","articletitle","Evidence for an Early Origin of Vernalization Responsiveness in Temperate Pooideae Grasses."
"27474116","abstracttext","The ability of plants to match their reproductive output with favorable environmental conditions has major consequences both for lifetime fitness and geographic patterns of diversity. In temperate ecosystems, some plant species have evolved the ability to use winter nonfreezing cold (vernalization) as a cue to ready them for spring flowering. However, it is unknown how important the evolution of vernalization responsiveness has been for the colonization and subsequent diversification of taxa within the northern and southern temperate zones. Grasses of subfamily Pooideae, including several important crops, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and oats (Avena sativa), predominate in the northern temperate zone, and it is hypothesized that their radiation was facilitated by the early evolution of vernalization responsiveness. Predictions of this early origin hypothesis are that a response to vernalization is widespread within the subfamily and that the genetic basis of this trait is conserved. To test these predictions, we determined and reconstructed vernalization responsiveness across Pooideae and compared expression of wheat vernalization gene orthologs VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) and VRN3 in phylogenetically representative taxa under cold and control conditions. Our results demonstrate that vernalization responsive Pooideae species are widespread, suggesting that this trait evolved early in the lineage and that at least part of the vernalization gene network is conserved throughout the subfamily. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the evolution of vernalization responsiveness was important for the initial transition of Pooideae out of the tropics and into the temperate zone."

In the present study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between the German winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars History and Rubens was used to identify genetic factors controlling these two physiological seed traits. A falling number (FN) test was employed to evaluate PHS, while SL was measured using a germination test (and the speed of germination) after controlled deterioration. FN of the population was assessed in four environments; SL traits were measured in one environment. Four major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FN were detected on chromosomes 4D, 5A, 5D, and 7B, whereas for SL traits, a major QTL was found on chromosome 1A. The FN QTL on chromosome 4D that coincided with the position of the dwarfing gene Rht-D1b only had effects in environments that were free of PHS. The remaining three QTL for FN were mostly pronounced under conditions conducive to PHS. The QTL on the long arm of chromosome 7B corresponded to the major gene locus controlling late maturity α-amylase (LMA) in wheat. The severity of the LMA phenotype became truly apparent under sprouting conditions. The position on the long arm of chromosome 1A of the QTL for SL points to a new QTL for this important regenerative seed trait."

"29251427","abstracttext","NAC transcription factors are widespread in the plant kingdom and play essential roles in the transcriptional regulation of defense responses. In this study, we isolated a novel NAC transcription factor gene, TaNAC30, from a cDNA library constructed from wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants inoculated with the stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). TaNAC30 contains a typical NAM domain and localizes to the nucleus. Yeast one-hybrid assays revealed that TaNAC30 exhibits transcriptional activity and that its C-terminus is necessary for the activation of transcription. Expression of TaNAC30 increased when host plants were infected with a virulent race (CYR31) of the rust fungus Pst. Silencing of TaNAC30 by virus-induced gene silencing inhibited colonization of the virulent Pst isolate CYR31. Moreover, detailed histological analyses showed that silencing of TaNAC30 enhanced resistance to Pst by inducing a significant increase in the accumulation of H 2 O 2 . Finally, we overexpressed TaNAC30 in fission yeast and determined that cell viability was severely reduced in TaNAC30-transformed cells grown on medium containing H 2 O 2 . These results suggest that TaNAC30 negatively regulates plant resistance in a compatible wheat-Pst interaction."

Yumechikara is a Japanese hard red winter wheat cultivar that shows moderate resistance to FHB with superior bread-making quality. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for FHB resistance in Yumechikara, we evaluated doubled haploid lines derived from a cross between Yumechikara and a moderate susceptible cultivar, Kitahonami, for FHB resistance in a 5-year field trial, and we analyzed polymorphic molecular markers between the parents. Our analysis of these markers identified two FHB-resistance QTLs, one from Yumechikara and one from Kitahonami. The QTL from Yumechikara, which explained 36.4% of the phenotypic variation, was mapped on the distal region of chromosome 1BS, which is closely linked to the low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit gene Glu-B3 and the glume color gene Rg-B1 . The other QTL (from Kitahonami) was mapped on chromosome 3BS, which explained 11.2% of the phenotypic variation. The close linkage between the FHB-resistance QTL on 1BS, Glu-B3 and Rg-B1 brings an additional value of simultaneous screening for both quality and FHB resistance using the glume color."

"30727632","abstracttext","A cloned cDNA to the wheat (Triticum aestivum) early cysteine-labeled metallothionein has many characteristics of a molecular marker for pollen embryogenesis in this plant. This transcript was not detected in uninucleate microspores at the time of culture or in pollen at any stage during normal ontogeny; its mRNA did begin to increase in embryogenic microspores within 6 h of culture, peaked at around 24 h, declined, then leveled off through the 21-day-old embryoid stage. Additionally, the accumulation of the embryoid-abundant EcMt gene transcript showed a direct and positive correlation with an increase of ABA in embryogenic microspores and developing pollen embryoids. Irradiating cultures with high intensity white light or with far-red, or blue light, suppressed EcMt transcript accumulation and the ability of microspores to form embryoids; however, light did not affect ABA concentrations during the early stages of culture. These results suggest that although a promoter of pollen embryogenesis in bread wheat, ABA alone cannot maintain the sporophytic differentiation of microspores subjected to inhibitory regimes of light in vitro. Whether or not light acts directly or indirectly in suppressing EcMt gene expression and pollen embryogenesis remains unknown."

"32810714","abstracttext","Catalases are crucial antioxidant enzymes that reduce the excessive level of H 2 O 2 caused by various environmental stresses and metal toxicity and hence protect the plant cells. In this study, a total of ten TaCAT genes, forming three homeologous groups, were identified in the genome of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and named as per the wheat gene symbolization guidelines. The identified catalases were characterized for various structural and physicochemical features. The proximal active-site (F(D/A)RERIPERVVHAKGASA) and heme-ligand (R(I/V)F(S/A)Y(A/S)DTQ) signature motifs, catalytic residues and peroxisomal targeting peptides were found conserved. Phylogenetic analysis clustered TaCATs into three classes, which showed conserved functional specialization based on their tissue specific expression. Modulated spatio-temporal expression of various TaCAT genes and alteration in total catalase enzyme activity during heat, drought, salt and arsenic (As III and As V ) treatment suggested their roles in abiotic stress response and arsenic tolerance. Molecular cloning and overexpression of TaCAT3-B gene in Escherichia coli showed tolerance against heat, drought, salt and varied concentrations of As III and As V treatments. The results further confirmed their role in stress tolerance and recommended that these genes can be used in future stress management strategies for the development of abiotic and arsenic stress resistant transgenic crops."

"27194050","abstracttext_background","Magnaporthe oryzae (anamorph Pyricularia oryzae) is the causal agent of blast disease of Poaceae crops and their wild relatives. To understand the genetic mechanisms that drive host specialization of M. oryzae, we carried out whole genome resequencing of four M. oryzae isolates from rice (Oryza sativa), one from foxtail millet (Setaria italica), three from wild foxtail millet S. viridis, and one isolate each from finger millet (Eleusine coracana), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and oat (Avena sativa), in addition to an isolate of a sister species M. grisea, that infects the wild grass Digitaria sanguinalis."
"27194050","abstracttext_results","Whole genome sequence comparison confirmed that M. oryzae Oryza and Setaria isolates form a monophyletic and close to another monophyletic group consisting of isolates from Triticum and Avena. This supports previous phylogenetic analysis based on a small number of genes and molecular markers. When comparing the host specific subgroups, 1.2-3.5 % of genes showed presence/absence polymorphisms and 0-6.5 % showed an excess of non-synonymous substitutions. Most of these genes encoded proteins whose functional domains are present in multiple copies in each genome. Therefore, the deleterious effects of these mutations could potentially be compensated by functional redundancy. Unlike the accumulation of nonsynonymous nucleotide substitutions, gene loss appeared to be independent of divergence time. Interestingly, the loss and gain of genes in pathogens from the Oryza and Setaria infecting lineages occurred more frequently when compared to those infecting Triticum and Avena even though the genetic distance between Oryza and Setaria lineages was smaller than that between Triticum and Avena lineages. In addition, genes showing gain/loss and nucleotide polymorphisms are linked to transposable elements highlighting the relationship between genome position and gene evolution in this pathogen species."
"27194050","abstracttext_conclusion","Our comparative genomics analyses of host-specific M. oryzae isolates revealed gain and loss of genes as a major evolutionary mechanism driving specialization to Oryza and Setaria. Transposable elements appear to facilitate gene evolution possibly by enhancing chromosomal rearrangements and other forms of genetic variation."

"21217808","abstracttext","Near-isogenic lines (NILs) are useful for plant genetic and genomic studies. However, the strength of conclusions from such studies depends on the similarity of the NILs' genetic backgrounds. In this study, we investigated the genetic similarity for a set of NILs developed in the 1990s to study gene-for-gene interactions between wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor (Say)), an important pest of wheat. Each of the eight NILs carries a single H resistance gene and was created by successive backcrossing for two to six generations to susceptible T. aestivum 'Newton'. We generated 256 target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) markers and used them to calculate genetic similarity, expressed by the Nei and Li (NL) coefficient. Six of the NILs (H3, H5, H6, H9, H11, and H13) had the highly uniform genetic background of Newton, with NL coefficients from 0.97 to 0.99. However, genotypes with H10 or H12 were less similar to Newton, with NL coefficients of 0.86 and 0.93, respectively. Cluster analysis based on NL coefficients and pedigree analysis showed that the genetic similarity between each of the NILs and Newton was affected by both the number of backcrosses and the genetic similarity between Newton and the H gene donors. We thus generated an equation to predict the number of required backcrosses, given varying similarity of donor and recurrent parent. We also investigated whether the genetic residues of the donor parents that remained in the NILs were related to linkage drag. By using a complete set of 'Chinese Spring' nullisomic-tetrasomic lines, one third of the TRAP markers that showed polymorphism between the NILs and Newton were assigned to a specific chromosome. All of the assigned markers were located on chromosomes other than the chromosome carrying the H gene, suggesting that the genetic residues detected in this study were not due to linkage drag. Results will aid in the development and use of near-isogenic lines for studies of the functional genomics of wheat."

"15650880","abstracttext","EST-derived microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (eSSR) occur in expressed sequence tags (EST). Here we report characteristics of eSSRs in the wheat genome, construction of consensus chromosome bin maps of SSR-containing ESTs ((SSR)ESTs), and development of eSSR markers for the 21 wheat chromosomes. A Perl script known as MISA was used to identify eSSRs in wheat ESTs available in the database http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/cgi-bin/ace/search/wEST ). Among 492,832 ESTs from the database, 36,520 (7.41%) contained 43,598 eSSRs. This is equivalent to 1 eSSR per 5.46 kb EST sequence. About 60% of the eSSRs were trinucleotides, 19.7% were mononucleotide, 16.7% were dinucleotides, and the remaining approximately 3% consisted of tetra-, penta-, and hexanucleotides. Among the identified eSSRs, (CCG/CGG)n is the most frequent (20.5%) followed by (A/T)n at 13.6%, (AAC/GTT)n at 11.7%, and (AG/CT)n at 8.7%. Among ESTs previously mapped to wheat chromosome bins, a total of 1,010 eSSR loci were derived from 341 (SSR)ESTs. Consensus chromosome bin maps showing the chromosome locations of (SSR)ESTs, SSR sequence motif, and cDNA library were constructed. A chi(2) test indicated that the distribution pattern of eSSR loci was generally similar to that of the original mapped ESTs in the wheat genome. Forty-eight (SSR)ESTs were converted into PCR-based eSSR markers, and 266 eSSR loci were mapped to specific chromosome arms using wheat cytogenetic stocks. The average polymorphism information content (0.45+/-0.16) of eSSR markers was lower than that reported for genomic SSRs (0.54+/-0.19), but higher than RFLPs (0.30+/-0.27). The eSSR markers were transferable among related Triticeae species, Triticum aestivum, T. durum, T. dicoccoides, Hordeum spontaneum, H. vulgare, and Secale cereale. The results confirm the presence of SSRs in expressed genes of wheat and demonstrate another application of ESTs in genomics research. eSSRs will be useful for gene tagging, gene cloning, and comparative genomics studies of cereal crops."

"16896711","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) originated about 8,000 years ago from the hybridization of tetraploid wheat with diploid Aegilops tauschii Coss. containing the D-genome. Thus, the bread wheat D-genome is evolutionary young and shows a low degree of polymorphism in the bread wheat gene pool. To increase marker density around the durable leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 located on chromosome 7DS, we used molecular information from the orthologous region in rice. Wheat expressed sequence tags (wESTs) were identified by homology with the rice genes in the interval of interest, but were monomorphic in the 'Arina' x 'Forno' mapping population. To derive new polymorphic markers, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones representing a total physical size of approximately 1 Mb and belonging to four contigs were isolated from Ae. tauschii by hybridization screening with wheat ESTs. Several BAC clones were low-pass sequenced, resulting in a total of approximately 560 kb of sequence. Ten microsatellite sequences were found, and three of them were polymorphic in our population and were genetically mapped close to Lr34. Comparative analysis of marker order revealed a large inversion between the rice genome and the wheat D-genome. The SWM10 microsatellite is closely linked to Lr34 and has the same allele in the three independent sources of Lr34: 'Frontana', 'Chinese Spring', and 'Forno', as well in most of the genotypes containing Lr34. Therefore, SWM10 is a highly useful marker to assist selection for Lr34 in breeding programs worldwide."

"17972649","abstracttext","Biotypes are infraspecific classifications based on biological rather than morphological characteristics. Cereal aphids are managed primarily by host plant resistance, and they often develop biotypes that injure or kill previously resistant plants. Although molecular genetic variation within aphid biotypes has been well documented, little is known about phenotypic variation, especially virulence or the biotype's ability to cause injury to cultivars with specific resistance genes. Five clones (single maternal lineages) of Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Homoptera: Aphididae), determined to be injurious to wheat, Triticum aestivum L., with the Dn4 gene, were evaluated on resistant and susceptible wheat and barley, Hordeum vulgare L., for their ability to cause chlorosis, reduction in plant height, and reduction in shoot dry weight. Variation to cause injury on resistant 'Halt' wheat, susceptible 'Jagger' wheat, and resistant 'STARS-9301B' barley was found among the Dn4 virulent clones. One clone caused up to 30.0 and 59.5% more reduction in plant height and shoot dry weight, respectively, on resistant Halt than other clones. It also caused up to 29.9 and 55.5% more reduction in plant height and shoot dry weight, respectively, on susceptible Jagger wheat. Although STARS-9301B barley exhibited an equal resistant response to feeding by all five clones based on chlorosis, two clones caused approximately 20% more reduction in plant height and shoot dry weight than three other clones. The most injurious clones on wheat were not the most injurious clones on barley. This is the first report of variation to cause varying degrees of plant damage within an aphid biotype virulent to a single host resistance gene. A single aphid clone may not accurately represent the true virulent nature of a biotype population in the field."

"19694433","abstracttext","Dietary micronutrient deficiencies, such as the lack of vitamin A, are a major source of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Carotenoids in food can function as provitamin A in humans, while grains of Chinese elite wheat cultivars generally have low carotenoid contents. To increase the carotenoid contents in common wheat endosperm, transgenic wheat has been generated by expressing the maize y1 gene encoding phytoene synthase driven by a endosperm-specific 1Dx5 promoter in the elite wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety EM12, together with the bacterial phytoene desaturase crtI gene from Erwinia uredovora under the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter control. A clear increase of the carotenoid content was detected in the endosperms of transgenic wheat that visually showed a light yellow color. The total carotenoids content was increased up to 10.8-fold as compared with the nontransgenic EM12 cultivar. To test whether the variability of total carotenoid content in different transgenic lines was due to differences in the transgene copy number or expression pattern, Southern hybridization and semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses were curried out. The results showed that transgene copy numbers and transcript levels did not associate well with carotenoid contents. The expression patterns of endogenous carotenoid genes, such as the phytoene synthases and carotene desaturases, were also investigated in wild-type and transgenic wheat lines. No significant changes in expression levels of these genes were detected in the transgenic endosperms, indicating that the increase in carotenoid transgenic wheat endosperms resulted from the expression of transgenes."
"22615061","articletitle","Pollen-mediated gene flow in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a semiarid field environment in Spain."
"22615061","abstracttext","Transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties are being developed and field-tested in various countries. Concerns regarding gene flow from genetically modified (GM) crops to non-GM crops have stimulated research to estimate outcrossing in wheat prior to the release and commercialization of any transgenic cultivars. The aim is to ensure that coexistence of all types of wheat with GM wheat is feasible in accordance with current regulations. The present study describes the result of a field experiment under the semi-arid climate conditions of Madrid, Spain, at two locations (""La Canaleja"" and ""El Encin"" experimental stations) in Madrid over a 3-year period, from 2005 to 2007. The experimental design consisted of a 50 × 50 m wheat pollen source sown with wheat cultivars resistant to the herbicide chlortoluron ('Deganit' and 'Castan' respectively) and three susceptible receptor cultivars ('Abental', 'Altria' and 'Recital') sown in replicated 1 × 1 m plots at different distances (0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80 and 100 m) and four directions. Outcrossing rates were measured as a percentage of herbicide-resistant hybrids using an herbicide-screening assay. Outcrossing was greatest near the pollen source, averaging 0.029% at 0 m distance at ""La Canaleja"" and 0.337% at ""El Encin"", both below the 0.9% European Union regulated threshold, although a maximum outcrossing rate of 3.5% was detected in one recipient plot. These percentages declined rapidly as the distance increased, but hybrids were detected at different rates at distances of up to 100 m, the maximum distance of the experiment. Environmental conditions, as drought in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006, may have influenced the extent of outcrossing. These assays carried out in wheat under semi-arid conditions in Europe provide a more complete assessment of pollen-mediated gene flow in this crop."

"24306320","abstracttext","This is the first report on genetic analysis and genome mapping of major dominant genes for near non-host resistance to barley crown rust ( Puccinia coronata var. hordei ) in common wheat. Barley crown rust, caused by Puccinia coronata var. hordei, primarily occurs on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) in the Great Plain regions of the United States. However, a few genotypes of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were susceptible to this pathogen among 750 wheat accessions evaluated. To investigate the genetics of crown rust resistance in wheat, a susceptible winter wheat accession PI 350005 was used in crosses with two resistant wheat varieties, Chinese Spring and Chris. Analysis of F1 plants and F2 populations from these two crosses indicated that crown rust resistance is controlled by one and two dominant genes in Chris and Chinese Spring, respectively. To determine the chromosome location of the resistance gene Cr1 in Chris, a set of 21 monosomic lines derived from Chris was used as female parents to cross with a susceptible spring type selection (SSTS35) derived from the PI 350005/Chris cross. Monosomic analysis indicated that Cr1 is located on chromosome 5D in Chris and one of the crown rust resistance genes is located on chromosome 2D in Chinese Spring. The other gene in Chinese Spring is not on 5D and thus is different from Cr1. Molecular linkage analysis and QTL mapping using a population of 136 doubled haploid lines derived from Chris/PI 350005 further positioned Cr1 between SSR markers Xwmc41-2 and Xgdm63 located on the long arm of chromosome 5D. Our study suggests that near non-host resistance to crown rust in these different common wheat genotypes is simply inherited."

"27019062","abstracttext","Israel and its vicinity constitute a center of diversity of domesticated wheat species (Triticum aestivum and T. durum) and their sympatrically growing wild relatives, including wild emmer wheat (T. dicoccoides). We investigated differentiation within the forma specialis of their obligate powdery mildew pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. A total of 61 B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates were collected from the three host species in four geographic regions of Israel. Genetic relatedness of the isolates was characterized using both virulence patterns on 38 wheat lines (including 21 resistance gene differentials) and presumptively neutral molecular markers (simple-sequence repeats and single-nucleotide polymorphisms). All isolates were virulent on at least some genotypes of all three wheat species tested. All assays divided the B. graminis f. sp. tritici collection into two distinct groups, those from domesticated hosts and those from wild emmer wheat. One-way migration was detected from the domestic wheat B. graminis f. sp. tritici population to the wild emmer B. graminis f. sp. tritici population at a rate of five to six migrants per generation. This gene flow may help explain the overlap between the distinct domestic and wild B. graminis f. sp. tritici groups. Overall, B. graminis f. sp. tritici is significantly differentiated into wild-emmer and domesticated-wheat populations, although the results do not support the existence of a separate f. sp. dicocci."

"27818611","abstracttext","Stripe rust disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and severely threatens wheat worldwide, repeatedly breaking resistance conferred by resistance genes and evolving more aggressive strains. Wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides , is an important source for novel stripe rust resistance ( Yr ) genes. Yr15 , a major gene located on chromosome 1BS of T. dicoccoides , was previously reported to confer resistance to a broad spectrum of stripe rust isolates, at both seedling and adult plant stages. Introgressions of Yr15 into cultivated T. aestivum bread wheat and T. durum pasta wheat that began in the 1980s are widely used. In the present study, we aimed to validate SSR markers from the Yr15 region as efficient tools for marker-assisted selection (MAS) for introgression of Yr15 into wheat and to compare the outcome of gene introgression by MAS and by conventional phenotypic selection. Our findings establish the validity of MAS for introgression of Yr15 into wheat. We show that the size of the introgressed segment, defined by flanking markers, varies for both phenotypic selection and MAS. The genetic distance of the MAS marker from Yr15 and the number of backcross steps were the main factors affecting the length of the introgressed donor segments. Markers Xbarc8 and Xgwm493 , which are the nearest flanking markers studied, were consistent and polymorphic in all 34 introgressions reported here and are therefore the most recommended markers for the introgression of Yr15 into wheat cultivars. Introgression directed by markers, rather than by phenotype, will facilitate simultaneous selection for multiple stripe rust resistant genes and will help to avoid escapees during the selection process."

"28330167","abstracttext","Genetic characterization, diversity analysis and estimate of the genetic relationship among varieties using functional and random DNA markers linked to agronomic traits can provide relevant guidelines in selecting parents and designing new breeding strategies for marker-assisted wheat cultivar improvement. Here, we characterize 20 Moroccan and 19 exotic bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars using 47 functional and 7 linked random DNA markers associated with 21 loci of the most important traits for wheat breeding. The functional marker analysis revealed that 35, 45, and 10 % of the Moroccan cultivars, respectively have the rust resistance genes (Lr34/Yr18/Pm38), dwarfing genes (Rht1b or Rht2b alleles) and the leaf rust resistance gene (Lr68). The marker alleles for genes Lr37/Yr17/Sr38, Sr24 and Yr36 were present only in the exotic cultivars and absent in Moroccan cultivars. 25 % of cultivars had 1BL.1RS translocation. 70 % of the wheat cultivars had Ppo-D1a and Ppo-A1b associated with low polyphenol oxidase activity. 10 % of cultivars showed presence of a random DNA marker allele (175 bp) linked to Hessian fly resistance gene H22. The majority of the Moroccan cultivars were carrying alleles that impart good bread making quality. Neighbor joining (NJ) and principal coordinate analysis based on the marker data revealed a clear differentiation between elite Moroccan and exotic wheat cultivars. The results of this study are useful for selecting suitable parents for making targeted crosses in marker-assisted wheat breeding and enhancing genetic diversity in the wheat cultivars."

This line was identified using cytogenetic techniques, analysis of genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), functional molecular markers (Expressed sequence tag-sequence-tagged site (EST-STS) and PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization-genomic in situ hybridization (sequential FISH-GISH), and assessment of agronomic traits and powdery mildew resistance. During the anaphase of meiosis, these were evenly distributed on both sides of the equatorial plate, and they exhibited high cytological stability during the meiotic metaphase and anaphase. GISH analysis indicated that W16998 contained a pair of Ae. geniculata alien chromosomes and 40 common wheat chromosomes. One EST-STS marker and seven PLUG marker results showed that the introduced chromosomes of Ae. geniculata belonged to homoeologous group 7. Nullisomic-tetrasomic analyses suggested that the common wheat chromosome, 7A, was absent in W16998. FISH and sequential FISH-GISH analyses confirmed that the introduced Ae. geniculata chromosome was 7M g . Therefore, W16998 was a wheat- Ae. geniculata 7M g (7A) alien disomic substitution line. Inoculation of isolate E09 ( Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ) in the seedling stage showed that SY159 and W16998 were resistant to powdery mildew, indeed nearly immune, whereas CS was highly susceptible. Compared to CS, W16998 exhibited increased grain weight and more spikelets, and a greater number of superior agronomic traits. Consequently, W16998 was potentially useful. Germplasms transfer new disease-resistance genes and prominent agronomic traits into common wheat, giving the latter some fine properties for breeding."

Although common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world, the function of the HD-Zip proteins in wheat is still largely unknown."
"32005165","abstracttext_results","To explore the potential biological functions of HD-Zip genes in wheat, we performed a bioinformatics and gene expression analysis of the HD-Zip family. We identified 113 HD-Zip members from wheat and classified them into four subfamilies (I-IV) based on phylogenic analysis against proteins from Arabidopsis, rice, and maize. Most HD-Zip genes are represented by two to three homeoalleles in wheat, which are named as TaHDZX_ZA, TaHDZX_ZB, or TaHDZX_ZD, where X denotes the gene number and Z the wheat chromosome on which it is located. TaHDZs in the same subfamily have similar protein motifs and intron/exon structures. The expression profiles of TaHDZ genes were analysed in different tissues, at different stages of vegetative growth, during seed development, and under drought stress. We found that most TaHDZ genes, especially those in subfamilies I and II, were induced by drought stress, suggesting the potential importance of subfamily I and II TaHDZ members in the responses to abiotic stress. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaHDZ5-6A displayed enhanced drought tolerance, lower water loss rates, higher survival rates, and higher proline content under drought conditions. Additionally, the transcriptome analysis identified a number of differentially expressed genes between 35S::TaHDZ5-6A transgenic and wild-type plants, many of which are involved in stress response."

"32720876","abstracttext","Plant subtilases (SBTs) or subtilisin-like proteases comprise a very diverse family of serine peptidases that participates in a broad spectrum of biological functions. Despite increasing evidence for roles of SBTs in plant immunity in recent years, little is known about wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) SBTs (TaSBTs). Here, we identified 255 TaSBT genes from bread wheat using the latest version 2.0 of the reference genome sequence. The SBT family can be grouped into five clades, from TaSBT1 to TaSBT5, based on a phylogenetic tree constructed with deduced protein sequences. In silico protein-domain analysis revealed the existence of considerable sequence diversification of the TaSBT family which, together with the local clustered gene distribution, suggests that TaSBT genes have undergone extensive functional diversification. Among those TaSBT genes whose expression was altered by biotic factors, TaSBT1.7 was found to be induced in wheat leaves by chitin and flg22 elicitors, as well as six examined pathogens, implying a role for TaSBT1.7 in plant defense. Transient overexpression of TaSBT1.7 in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves resulted in necrotic cell death. Moreover, knocking down TaSBT1.7 in wheat using barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing compromised the hypersensitive response and resistance against Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici , the causal agent of wheat stripe rust. Taken together, this study defined the full complement of wheat SBT genes and provided evidence for a positive role of one particular member, TaSBT1.7 , in the incompatible interaction between wheat and a stripe rust pathogen."

"33200319","abstracttext_key message","A major QTL for oviposition deterrence to orange wheat blossom midge was detected on chromosome 1A in the Canadian breeding line BW278 that was inherited from the Chinese variety Sumai-3. Orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM, Sitodiplosis mosellana Géhin, Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) is an important insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that reduces both grain yield and quality. Oviposition deterrence results in a reduction of eggs deposited on spikes relative to that observed on a wheat line preferred by OWBM. Quantification of oviposition deterrence is labor-intensive, so wheat breeders require efficient DNA markers for the selection of this trait. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for oviposition deterrence in a doubled haploid (DH) population developed from the spring wheat cross Superb/BW278. The DH population and check varieties were evaluated for OWBM kernel damage from five field nurseries over three growing seasons. QTL analysis identified major effect loci on chromosomes 1A (QSm.mrc-1A) and 5A (QSm.mrc-5A). Reduced kernel damage was contributed by BW278 at QSm.mrc-1A and Superb at QSm.mrc-5A. QSm.mrc-1A mapped to the approximate location of the oviposition deterrence QTL previously found in the American variety Reeder. However, haplotype analysis revealed that BW278 inherited this oviposition deterrence allele from the Chinese spring wheat variety Sumai-3. QSm.mrc-5A mapped to the location of awn inhibitor gene B1, suggesting that awns hinder OWBM oviposition. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified for predicting the presence or absence of QSm.mrc-1A based upon haplotype. Functional annotation of candidate genes in 1A QTL intervals revealed eleven potential candidate genes, including a gene involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. SNPs for QSm.mrc-1A and fully awned spikes provide a basis for the selection of oviposition deterrence to OWBM."

This is of great importance for functional studies in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), where most of the genes are present in at least three homoeologous copies and conventional insertional mutagenesis is not effective. We have introduced into bread wheat double-stranded RNA-expressing constructs containing fragments of genes encoding Phytoene Desaturase (PDS) or the signal transducer of ethylene, Ethylene Insensitive 2 (EIN2). Transformed plants showed phenotypic changes that were stably inherited over at least two generations. These changes were very similar to mutant phenotypes of the two genes in diploid model plants. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed a good correlation between decreasing mRNA levels and increasingly severe phenotypes. RNAi silencing had the same quantitative effect on all three homoeologous genes. The most severe phenotypes were observed in homozygous plants that showed the strongest mRNA reduction and, interestingly, produced around 2-fold the amount of small RNAs compared to heterozygous plants. This suggests that the effect of RNAi in hexaploid wheat is gene-dosage dependent. Wheat seedlings with low mRNA levels for EIN2 were ethylene insensitive. Thus, EIN2 is a positive regulator of the ethylene-signaling pathway in wheat, very similar to its homologs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). Our data show that RNAi results in stably inherited phenotypes and therefore represents an efficient tool for functional genomic studies in polyploid wheat."

Genes coding for TFs have been identified in the sequences of model plant genomes. The rice (Oryza sativa spp. japonica) genome contains 2,384 TF gene models, which represent the mRNA transcript of a locus, classed into 63 families."
"20298594","abstracttext_results","We have created an extensive list of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) TF sequences based on sequence homology with rice TFs identified and classified in the Database of Rice Transcription Factors (DRTF).

This number is about three times the number of TFs in rice so proportionally is very similar if allowance is made for the hexaploidy of wheat. Of these sequences 3,820 encode gene products with a DNA-binding domain and thus were confirmed as potential regulators. These 3,820 sequences were classified into 40 families and 84 subfamilies and some members defined orphan families. The results were compiled in the Database of Wheat Transcription Factor (wDBTF), an inventory available on the web http://wwwappli.nantes.inra.fr:8180/wDBFT/.

"26660463","abstracttext_key message","Genetic and mutational analyses of wheat leaf rust resistance gene Lr13 and hybrid necrosis gene Ne2 m indicated that they are the same gene. Hybrid necrosis in wheat characterized by chlorosis and eventual necrosis of plant tissues in certain wheat hybrids is controlled by the interaction of complementary dominant genes Ne1 and Ne2 located on chromosome arms 5BL and 2BS, respectively. Multiple alleles at each locus can be identified by differences in necrotic phenotypes when varieties are crossed with a fixed accession of the other genotype. Some of at least five Ne2 alleles were described as s (strong), m (medium) and w (weak); alleles of Ne1 were similarly described. Ne2m causes moderate necrosis in hybrids with genotypes having Ne1s. Ne2 is located on chromosome arm 2BS in close proximity to Lr13. Most wheat lines with Ne2m carry Lr13, and all wheat lines with Lr13 appear to carry Ne2m. To further dissect the relationship between Lr13 and Ne2m, more than 350 crosses were made between cv. Spica (Triticum aestivum) or Kubanka (T. durum) carrying Ne1s and recombinant inbred lines or doubled haploid lines from three crosses segregating for Lr13. F1 plants from lines carrying Lr13 crossed with Spica (Ne1s) always showed progressive necrosis; those lacking Lr13 did not. Four wheat cultivars/lines carrying Lr13 were treated with the mutagen EMS. Thirty-five susceptible mutants were identified; eight were distinctly less glaucous and late maturing indicative of chromosome 2B or sub-chromosome loss. Hybrids of phenotypically normal Lr13 mutant plants crossed with Spica did not produce symptoms of hybrid necrosis. Thus, Lr13 and one particular Ne2m allele may be the same gene."

"28983311","abstracttext","Recently the TaMYC1 gene encoding bHLH transcription factor has been isolated from the bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) genome and shown to co-locate with the Pp3 gene conferring purple pericarp color. As a functional evidence of TaMYC1 and Pp3 being the same, higher transcriptional activity of the TaMYC1 gene in colored pericarp compared to uncolored one has been demonstrated. In the current study, we present additional strong evidences of TaMYC1 to be a synonym of Pp3 . Furthermore, we have found differences between dominant and recessive Pp3 ( TaMyc1 ) alleles. Light enhancement of TaMYC1 transcription was paralleled with increased AP accumulation only in purple-grain wheat. Coexpression of TaMYC1 and the maize MYB TF gene ZmC1 induced AP accumulation in the coleoptile of white-grain wheat. Suppression of TaMYC1 significantly reduced AP content in purple grains. Two distinct TaMYC1 alleles ( TaMYC1p and TaMYC1w ) were isolated from purple- and white-grained wheat, respectively. A unique, compound cis -acting regulatory element had six copies in the promoter of TaMYC1p , but was present only once in TaMYC1w . Analysis of recombinant inbred lines showed that TaMYC1p was necessary but not sufficient for AP accumulation in the pericarp tissues. Examination of larger sets of germplasm lines indicated that the evolution of purple pericarp in tetraploid wheat was accompanied by the presence of TaMYC1p . Our findings may promote more systematic basic and applied studies of anthocyanins in common wheat and related Triticeae crops."

"28955354","abstracttext","Calreticulin (CRT), an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized Ca 2+ -binding/buffering protein, is highly conserved and extensively expressed in animal and plant cells. To understand the function of CRTs in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), particularly their roles in stress tolerance, we cloned the full-length genomic sequence of the TaCRT-D isoform from D genome of common hexaploid wheat, and characterized its function by transgenic Arabidopsis system. TaCRT-D exhibited different expression patterns in wheat seedling under different abiotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing ORF of TaCRT-D displayed more tolerance to drought, cold, salt, mannitol, and other abiotic stresses at both seed germination and seedling stages, compared with the wild-type controls. Furthermore, DNA polymorphism analysis and gene mapping were employed to develop the functional markers of this gene for marker-assistant selection in wheat breeding program. One SNP, S440 (T→C) was detected at the TaCRT-D locus by genotyping a wheat recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (114 lines) developed from Opata 85 × W7984. The TaCRT-D was then fine mapped between markers Xgwm645 and Xgwm664 on chromosome 3DL, corresponding to genetic distances of 3.5 and 4.4 cM, respectively, using the RIL population and Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines. Finally, the genome-specific and allele-specific markers were developed for the TaCRT-D gene. These findings indicate that TaCRT-D function importantly in plant stress responses, providing a gene target for genetic engineering to increase plant stress tolerance and the functional markers of TaCRT-D for marker-assistant selection in wheat breeding."

Decaploid Thinopyrum ponticum (2n = 10x = 70) serves as an important gene pool for wheat improvement. The wheat-Th. ponticum 4Ag (4D) disomic substitution line Blue 58, derived from a distant hybridization between Th. ponticum and common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), bears blue coloration in the aleurone layer. To map the blue-grained gene, eight wheat-Th. ponticum 4Ag translocation lines with different chromosomal segment sizes were obtained from Blue 58 using 60 Co-γ ray irradiation and were characterized using cytogenetic and molecular marker analysis. A small-segment blue-grained wheat translocation line L13, accounting for one-fifth of 4AgL, was obtained. A physical map of chromosome 4Ag was constructed containing 573 specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) markers, including three bins with 223 markers on 4AgS and eight bins with 350 markers on 4AgL. The blue-grained gene in three blue-grained translocation lines L5, L9, and L13, was located on bin 4AgL-6 with FL 0.75-0.89. Moreover, 89 blue-grain-related molecular markers and one fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probe, pThp12.19, were identified in this bin. The newly developed translocation lines and the molecular markers and FISH probe will facilitate the application of the Th. ponticum-origin blue-grained characteristic in wheat breeding."

"21114819","abstracttext_background","Mutational inactivation of plant genes is an essential tool in gene function studies. Plants with inactivated or deleted genes may also be exploited for crop improvement if such mutations/deletions produce a desirable agronomical and/or quality phenotype. However, the use of mutational gene inactivation/deletion has been impeded in polyploid plant species by genetic redundancy, as polyploids contain multiple copies of the same genes (homologous genes) encoded by each of the ancestral genomes. Similar to many other crop plants, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is polyploid; specifically allohexaploid possessing three progenitor genomes designated as 'A', 'B', and 'D'. Recently modified TILLING protocols have been developed specifically for mutation detection in wheat. Whilst extremely powerful in detecting single nucleotide changes and small deletions, these methods are not suitable for detecting whole gene deletions. Therefore, high-throughput methods for screening of candidate homologous gene deletions are needed for application to wheat populations generated by the use of certain mutagenic agents (e.g. heavy ion irradiation) that frequently generate whole-gene deletions."
"21114819","abstracttext_results","To facilitate the screening for specific homologous gene deletions in hexaploid wheat, we have developed a TaqMan qPCR-based method that allows high-throughput detection of deletions in homologous copies of any gene of interest, provided that sufficient polymorphism (as little as a single nucleotide difference) amongst homologues exists for specific probe design. We used this method to identify deletions of individual TaPFT1 homologues, a wheat orthologue of the disease susceptibility and flowering regulatory gene PFT1 in Arabidopsis. This method was applied to wheat nullisomic-tetrasomic lines as well as other chromosomal deletion lines to locate the TaPFT1 gene to the long arm of chromosome 5. By screening of individual DNA samples from 4500 M2 mutant wheat lines generated by heavy ion irradiation, we detected multiple mutants with deletions of each TaPFT1 homologue, and confirmed these deletions using a CAPS method. We have subsequently designed, optimized, and applied this method for the screening of homologous deletions of three additional wheat genes putatively involved in plant disease resistance."

"15729394","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by species of the fungus Fusarium, is a worldwide disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The Chinese T. aestivum 'Ning7840' is one of few wheat cultivars with resistance to FHB. To identify differentially expressed genes corresponding to FHB resistance, a cDNA library was constructed using pooled mRNA isolated from glumes of 'Ning7840' harvested at 2, 6, 12, 24, 36, 72, and 96 h after inoculation (hai) with a conidia spore suspension of Fusarium graminearum. Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA subtraction was carried out using pooled glume mRNAs from the tester and the control. The cDNA library was differentially screened using the forward subtracted cDNAs and the reverse subtracted cDNAs as probes. Twenty-four clones with significant matches to either plant (16 sequences) or fungal (8 sequences) genes were isolated based on their specific hybridization with forward subtracted cDNA and not reverse subtracted cDNA. Six putative defense-related genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR. Many-fold higher induction of three clones (A3F8, B10H1, and B11H3) in the resistant genotypes compared with susceptible genotypes indicates a putative role in the resistance response to Fusarium graminearum. Transcript accumulations of P450, chitinase (Chi1), and one unknown gene (clone B8Q9) in both resistant and susceptible genotypes suggest an involvement in a generalized resistance response to F. graminearum. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed that cDNA clone A4C6 encodes a cytochrome P450 gene (CYP709C3v2), including 14 N-terminal amino acids that have a membrane-associated helical motif. Other domains characteristic of eukaryotic P450 are also present in CYP709C3v2. The deduced polypeptide of cDNA clone B2H2 encodes an acidic isoform of class I chitinase containing a 960-bp coding region. Southern hybridization using aneuploid lines of T. aestivum 'Chinese Spring' indicated that CYP709C3v2 was located on the short arm of chromosomes 2B and 2D."

"32688702","abstracttext","Advances in DNA sequencing technologies have produced an ever increasing number of sequenced genomes. However, many of the genes identified in these sequencing efforts have unknown functions or functions inferred based upon sequence homology, highlighting the necessity for functional gene analysis. Mutagenesis combined with phenotypic analyses remains a key mechanism for identifying and establishing gene function. Activation tagging is a mutagenic process that uses altered gene expression, usually gene overexpression, to generate mutant phenotypes. We have developed an activation tagging system in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) based upon a maize (Zea mays L.) transposable element that carries two highly expressed cereal promoters. Insertion of this mobile genetic element in the genome can lead to insertional gene inactivation, gene overexpression and gene silencing through the production of antisense transcripts. This transposable element system has also been introduced into both wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize and transposon mobility observed."

"12582641","abstracttext","It is well-established that the enzyme polyphenol oxidase (PPO) is involved in undesirable browning of noodles, chapattis, middle east flat breads and steamed breads. Methods for measuring PPO activity have been developed, and the variation of PPO activity among wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars has been well documented. However, there is no report on the identification and characterization of a wheat PPO gene. PCR performed on wheat genomic DNA with oligonucleotide primers designed from conserved copper binding regions of other PPO genes resulted in amplification of a 444-bp DNA fragment. Sequence analysis identified the conserved amino acids of PPO genes indicating that the PCR product was part of the wheat PPO gene. Screening genomic and cDNA libraries using 444- and 760-bp DNA fragments as probes failed to identify a PPO gene based on conserved sequence, even though there were very strong hybridization signals for some isolates. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique was used as an alternative to obtain the remaining DNA sequences in 5' and 3' directions based on the 444-bp partial wheat PPO gene sequence. With the use of ThermoScript Reverse Transcriptase (which functions at higher temperatures) and Advantage-GC cDNA kit, the complete DNA sequence in the 3' direction was obtained. A similar effort in the 5' direction resulted in amplification of a truncated 414-bp DNA sequence. Overall, 1,509-bp of putative wheat PPO DNA sequence was obtained. Alignment of deduced amino-acid sequences revealed similarity to the other PPO gene sequences, especially in the conserved copper binding regions. Southern-blot analysis performed with four different restriction enzymes revealed two to four DNA fragments, suggesting a limited number of PPO genes in wheat. Wheat genomic DNA restricted with HindIII and hybridized using a 760-bp wheat PPO probe revealed a clear distinction between wheat cultivars with high and low PPO activities. Northern-blot analysis indicated a transcript size of about 2.0-kb. PPO DNA fragment as well as RNA transcript was observed for the durum cultivar Renville which normally has very low PPO activity. Further study is needed to explain the relationship between PPO activity and the presence of PPO gene (s)."

"31623139","abstracttext","The vacuolar H + -ATPase (V-ATPase) plays many important roles in cell growth and in response to stresses in plants. The V-ATPase subunit H (VHA-H) is required to form a stable and active V-ATPase. Genome-wide analyses of VHA-H genes in crops contribute significantly to a systematic understanding of their functions. A total of 22 VHA-H genes were identified from 11 plants representing major crops including cotton, rice, millet, sorghum, rapeseed, maize, wheat, soybean, barley, potato, and beet. All of these VHA-H genes shared exon-intron structures similar to those of Arabidopsis thaliana . The C-terminal domain of VHA-H was shorter and more conserved than the N-terminal domain. The VHA-H gene was effectively used as a genetic marker to infer the phylogenetic relationships among plants, which were congruent with currently accepted taxonomic groupings. The VHA-H genes from six species of crops ( Gossypium raimondii , Brassica napus , Glycine max , Solanum tuberosum , Triticum aestivum , and Zea mays ) showed high gene structural diversity. This resulted from the gains and losses of introns. Seven VHA-H genes in six species of crops ( Gossypium raimondii , Hordeum vulgare , Solanum tuberosum , Setaria italica , Triticum aestivum , and Zea mays ) contained multiple transcript isoforms arising from alternative splicing. The study of cis-acting elements of gene promoters and RNA-seq gene expression patterns confirms the role of VHA-H genes as eco-enzymes. The gene structural diversity and proteomic diversity of VHA-H genes in our crop sampling facilitate understanding of their functional diversity, including stress responses and traits important for crop improvement."

"30626760","abstracttext","We investigated the genetic diversity of the core collection of hexaploid wheat accessions in the Japanese wheat gene bank, NBRP-Wheat, with a focus on grain morphology. We scanned images of grains in the core collection, which consists of 189 accessions of Triticum aestivum, T. spelta, T. compactum, T. sphaerococcum, T. macha and T. vavilovii. From the scanned images, we recorded six metric characters (area size, perimeter length, grain length, grain width, length to width ratio and circularity) using the software package SmartGrain ver. 1.2. Statistical analyses of the collected data along with hundred-grain weight revealed that T. aestivum has the largest diversity in grain morphology. Principal component analysis of these seven characters demonstrated that two principal components (PC core 1 and PC core 2) explain more than 96% of the variation in the core collection accessions. The correlation coefficients between the principal components and characters indicate that PC core 1 is related to grain size and PC core 2 to grain shape. From a genome-wide association study, we found a total of 15 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for grain morphological characters. More interestingly, we found mutually exclusive MTAs for PC core 1 and PC core 2 on 18 and 13 chromosomes, respectively. The results suggest that grain morphology in hexaploid wheat is determined by two factors, grain size and grain shape, which are under the control of multiple genetic loci."

Co-transformation experiments were carried out in parallel using either circular whole plasmid(s) or linear gene cassettes which were purified from the same plasmid by restrictive digestion, each cassette consisting of a promoter, an open reading frame, and a terminator. Six transgenic wheat lines transformed with 1Ax1 plus bar gene cassettes, five lines with gus plus bar gene cassettes, three lines with p1Ax1 plus pAHC20, and two lines with pAHC25 were regenerated with transformation frequencies of 0.6, 0.5, 0.3, and 0.2%, respectively. Southern blotting analysis showed that there were 1-4 hybridizing bands in transgenic lines carrying gene cassettes, of which most lines displayed single-copy transgene insertion. Expression analyses showed that 50.5% of the T1 lines carrying gus plus bar gene cassettes have the expression signals of two genes. SDS-PAGE analysis of the T1 generation revealed that 71% of herbicide-resistant plants carrying 1Ax1 plus bar gene cassettes expressed the high molecular weight subunit 1Ax1 in the endosperm. Gene cassettes were transmitted and segregated in the subsequent generations, in simple Mendelian ratios. In addition, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) results confirmed that 1Ax1 gene cassettes were expressed specifically in the endosperm of the transgenic wheat plant. It is proposed that gene transfer using multiple gene cassettes offers an efficient and rapid method to obtain the single-copy transgenic wheat."

"24824421","abstracttext","In the process (BC3F1 generation) of backcrossing an Avena isolate of Pyricularia oryzae with a Triticum isolate, color mutants with white mycelia were obtained. These white mutants lacked virulence on all (31/31) hexaploid and most (28/32) tetraploid wheat lines tested. In a BC4F1 population, white and black cultures segregated in a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that the mutant phenotype is controlled by a single gene. Furthermore, the mycelial color was perfectly linked with avirulence in the BC4F1 population; white cultures were all avirulent on common wheat (Triticum aestivum) 'Norin 4' (N4) whereas black cultures were all virulent. White cultures in the BC3F1 and BC4F1 generations were also avirulent on tetraploid wheat (T. dicoccoides) accession 'KU109' (Tat4), which was susceptible to all cultures derived from the parental wild isolates through the BC2F1 generation. A cross between Tat4 and a susceptible tetraploid (T. paleocolchicum) accession 'KU196' (Tat14) produced resistant and susceptible F2 seedlings in a 3:1 ratio against the white cultures. In the F3 generation homozygous resistant/segregating/homozygous susceptible lines segregated in a 1:2:1 ratio. These results suggest that the resistance of Tat4 to the white cultures is controlled by a single major gene. This gene, tentatively designated as RmgTd(t), is considered to be a hidden resistance gene because it was not detected with the Br58, F1, BC1F1, or BC2F1 cultures. Cytological analysis revealed that the moderate resistance controlled by RmgTd(t) was associated with a hypersensitive reaction of mesophyll cells."

"24033823","abstracttext","Winter wheat requires a period of low temperatures to accelerate flowering (vernalization). This requirement could make winter wheat more vulnerable to elevated global temperature via insufficient vernalization. All known vernalization genes are cloned according to qualitative variation in vernalization requirement between spring and winter wheat, but the genes controlling quantitative variation for more or less vernalization requirement among winter wheat cultivars remain unknown. We report here that the gene for the vernalization requirement duration in winter wheat was cloned using a BC(1)F(2:3) population that segregated in a 3:1 ratio of early-flowering plants and late-flowering plants after vernalization for 3 weeks. The positional cloning of the gene for vernalization requirement duration demonstrated that this trait is controlled by TaVRN-A1 at the protein level. The Ala(180) in vrn-A1a, encoded by the dominant allele for 3-week vernalization, was mutated to Val(180) in vrn-A1b, encoded by the recessive allele for 6-week vernalization. Further studies with in vitro protein pull-down assays and immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that the mutated Val(180) in vrn-A1b protein decreased the ability to bind with TaHOX1 (the first homeobox protein in Triticum aestivum). The direct binding of TaVRN-A1 and TaHOX1 proteins was confirmed in the nucleus of living plant cells by bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analyses. The TaHOX1 gene was found to be upregulated by low temperatures, and to have a significant genetic effect on heading date, suggesting that TaHOX1 functions in the flowering pathway in winter wheat."

"26237413","abstracttext","Rye (Secale cereale L.) possesses many valuable genes that can be used for improving disease resistance, yield and environment adaptation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, the documented resistance stocks derived from rye is faced severe challenge due to the variation of virulent isolates in the pathogen populations. Therefore, it is necessary to develop desirable germplasm and search for novel resistance gene sources against constantly accumulated variation of the virulent isolates. In the present study, a new wheat-rye line designated as WR49-1 was produced through distant hybridization and chromosome engineering protocols between common wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 and rye cultivar German White. Using sequential GISH (genomic in situ hybridization), mc-FISH (multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization), mc-GISH (multicolor GISH) and EST (expressed sequence tag)-based marker analysis, WR49-1 was proved to be a new wheat-rye 6R disomic addition line. As expected, WR49-1 showed high levels of resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, Bgt) pathogens prevalent in China at the adult growth stage and 19 of 23 Bgt isolates tested at the seedling stage. According to its reaction pattern to different Bgt isolates, WR49-1 may possess new resistance gene(s) for powdery mildew, which differed from the documented powdery mildew gene, including Pm20 on chromosome arm 6RL of rye. Additionally, WR49-1 was cytologically stable, had improved agronomic characteristics and therefore could serve as an important bridge for wheat breeding and chromosome engineering."

"28515146","abstracttext","Early reproductive development in cereals is crucial for final grain number per spike and hence the yield potential of the crop. To date, however, no systematic analyses of gene expression profiles during this important process have been conducted for common wheat ( Triticum aestivum ). Here, we studied the transcriptome profiles at four stages of early wheat reproductive development, from spikelet initiation to floral organ differentiation. K -means clustering and stage-specific transcript identification detected dynamically expressed homeologs of important transcription regulators in spikelet and floral meristems that may be involved in spikelet initiation, floret meristem specification, and floral organ patterning, as inferred from their homologs in model plants. Small RNA transcriptome sequencing discovered key microRNAs that were differentially expressed during wheat inflorescence development alongside their target genes, suggesting that miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms for floral development may be conserved in cereals and Arabidopsis. Our analysis was further substantiated by the functional characterization of the ARGONAUTE1d ( AGO1d ) gene, which was initially expressed in stamen primordia and later in the tapetum during anther maturation. In agreement with its stage-specific expression pattern, the loss of function of the predominantly expressed B homeolog of AGO1d in a tetraploid durum wheat mutant resulted in smaller anthers with more infertile pollens than the wild type and a reduced grain number per spike. Together, our work provides a first glimpse of the gene regulatory networks in wheat inflorescence development that may be pivotal for floral and grain development, highlighting potential targets for genetic manipulation to improve future wheat yields."

"28742823","abstracttext","The MADS-box genes encode transcription factors with key roles in plant growth and development. A comprehensive analysis of the MADS-box gene family in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) has not yet been conducted, and our understanding of their roles in stress is rather limited. Here, we report the identification and characterization of the MADS-box gene family in wheat. A total of 180 MADS-box genes classified as 32 Mα, 5 Mγ, 5 Mδ, and 138 MIKC types were identified. Evolutionary analysis of the orthologs among T. urartu, Aegilops tauschii and wheat as well as homeologous sequences analysis among the three sub-genomes in wheat revealed that gene loss and chromosomal rearrangements occurred during and/or after the origin of bread wheat. Forty wheat MADS-box genes that were expressed throughout the investigated tissues and development stages were identified. The genes that were regulated in response to both abiotic stresses (i.e., phosphorus deficiency, drought, heat, and combined drought and heat) and biotic stresses (i.e., Fusarium graminearum, Septoria tritici, stripe rust and powdery mildew) were detected as well. A few notable MADS-box genes were specifically expressed in a single tissue and those showed relatively higher expression differences between the stress and control treatment. The expression patterns of considerable MADS-box genes differed from those of their orthologs in Brachypodium, rice, and Arabidopsis. Collectively, the present study provides new insights into the possible roles of MADS-box genes in response to stresses and will be valuable for further functional studies of important candidate MADS-box genes."

"29940859","abstracttext_background","The relatively low efficiency of biolistic transformation and subsequent integration of multiple copies of the introduced gene/s significantly complicate the genetic modification of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other plant species. One of the key factors contributing to the reproducibility of this method is the uniformity of the DNA/gold suspension, which is dependent on the coating procedure employed. It was also shown recently that the relative frequency of single copy transgene inserts could be increased through the use of nanogram quantities of the DNA during coating."
"29940859","abstracttext_results","A simplified DNA/gold coating method was developed to produce fertile transgenic plants, via microprojectile bombardment of callus cultures induced from immature embryos. In this method, polyethyleneglycol (PEG) and magnesium salt solutions were utilized in place of the spermidine and calcium chloride of the standard coating method, to precipitate the DNA onto gold microparticles. The prepared microparticles were used to generate transgenics from callus cultures of commercial bread wheat cv. Gladius resulting in an average transformation frequency of 9.9%. To increase the occurrence of low transgene copy number events, nanogram amounts of the minimal expression cassettes containing the gene of interest and the hpt gene were used for co-transformation. A total of 1538 transgenic wheat events were generated from 15,496 embryos across 19 independent experiments. The variation of single copy insert frequencies ranged from 16.1 to 73.5% in the transgenic wheat plants, which compares favourably to published results."

"29884124","articletitle","A PSTOL-like gene, TaPSTOL, controls a number of agronomically important traits in wheat."
"29884124","abstracttext_background","Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth, and is required in large quantities by elite varieties of crops to maintain yields. Approximately 70% of global cultivated land suffers from P deficiency, and it has recently been estimated that worldwide P resources will be exhausted by the end of this century, increasing the demand for crops more efficient in their P usage. A greater understanding of how plants are able to maintain yield with lower P inputs is, therefore, highly desirable to both breeders and farmers. Here, we clone the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) homologue of the rice PSTOL gene (OsPSTOL), and characterize its role in phosphate nutrition plus other agronomically important traits."
"29884124","abstracttext_results","TaPSTOL is a single copy gene located on the short arm of chromosome 5A, encoding a putative kinase protein, and shares a high level of sequence similarity to OsPSTOL. We re-sequenced TaPSTOL from 24 different wheat accessions and (3) three T. durum varieties. No sequence differences were detected in 26 of the accessions, whereas two indels were identified in the promoter region of one of the durum wheats. We characterised the expression of TaPSTOL under different P concentrations and demonstrated that the promoter was induced in root tips and hairs under P limiting conditions. Overexpression and RNAi silencing of TaPSTOL in transgenic wheat lines showed that there was a significant effect upon root biomass, flowering time independent of P treatment, tiller number and seed yield, correlating with the expression of TaPSTOL. However this did not increase PUE as elevated P concentration in the grain did not correspond to increased yields."
"29884124","abstracttext_conclusions","Manipulation of TaPSTOL expression in wheat shows it is responsible for many of the previously described phenotypic advantages as OsPSTOL except yield. Furthermore, we show TaPSTOL contributes to additional agronomically important traits including flowering time and grain size. Analysis of TaPSTOL sequences from a broad selection of wheat varieties, encompassing 91% of the genetic diversity in UK bread wheat, showed that there is very little genetic variation in this gene, which would suggest that this locus may have been under high selection pressure."

Due to the difficulty in Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of wheat, the reported applications in CRISPR/Cas9 system were all based on the biolistic transformation."
"30477421","abstracttext_results","In the present study, we efficiently applied targeted mutagenesis in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) protoplasts and transgenic T0 plants using the CRISPR/Cas9 system delivered via Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Seven target sites in three genes (Pinb, waxy and DA1) were selected to construct individual expression vectors. The activities of the sgRNAs were evaluated by transforming the constructed vectors into wheat protoplasts. Mutations in the targets were detected by Illumina sequencing. Genome editing, including insertions or deletions at the target sites, was found in the wheat protoplast cells. The highest mutation efficiency was 6.8% in the DA1 gene. The CRISPR/Cas9 binary vector targeting the DA1 gene was then transformed into common wheat plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, resulting in efficient target gene editing in the T0 generation. Thirteen mutant lines were generated, and the mutation efficiency was 54.17%. Mutations were found in the A and B genomes of the transgenic plants but not in the D genome. In addition, off-target mutations were not detected in regions that were highly homologous to the sgRNA sequences."

"31646363","abstracttext_key message","Markers, located in Dicer1 and Ara6 genes, which are likely involved in cross-kingdom RNA trafficking, are associated with FHB resistance in GABI wheat population and were validated in biparental population. Association studies are a common approach to detect marker-trait associations for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum), although verification of detected associations is exceptional. In the present study, candidate-gene association mapping (CG) of genes from silencing and secretory pathways, which may be involved in wheat resistance against FHB and cross-kingdom RNA trafficking, was performed. Fourteen markers, located in nine genes, were tested for association with FHB resistance in 356 lines from the GABI (genome analysis of the biological system of plants) wheat population. Three markers located in the genes Dicer1 and Ara6 were shown to be significantly associated with the studied trait. Verification of this finding was performed using the recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population 'Apache × Biscay', segregating for four of our 14 selected markers. We could show association of the Ara6 marker with plant height as well as association with FHB resistance for three markers located in Rab5-like GTPase gene Ara6 and Dicer1. These results confirmed the trait-marker associations detected also in the CG approach. Gene products of the associated genes are involved in response of the plant to pathogens, plant metabolism and may be involved in cross-kingdom RNA trafficking efficiency. The markers detected in the GABI wheat population, which were also validated in the biparental population, can potentially be used in wheat breeding."
"17058103","articletitle","Introgression of an imidazolinone-resistance gene from winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) into jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host)."
"17058103","abstracttext","Imidazolinone-resistant winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is being commercialized in the USA. This technology allows wheat growers to selectively control jointed goatgrass (Aegilops cylindrica Host), a weed that is especially problematic because of its close genetic relationship with wheat. However, the potential movement of the imidazolinone-resistance gene from winter wheat to jointed goatgrass is a concern. Winter wheat and jointed goatgrass have the D genome in common and can hybridize and backcross under natural field conditions. Since the imidazolinone-resistance gene (Imi1) is located on the D genome, it is possible for resistance to be transferred to jointed goatgrass via hybridization and backcrossing. To study the potential for gene movement, BC(2)S(2) plants were produced artificially using imidazolinone-resistant winter wheat (cv. FS-4) as the female parent and a native jointed goatgrass collection as the male recurrent parent. FS-4, the jointed goatgrass collection, and 18 randomly selected BC(2)S(2) populations were treated with imazamox. The percentage of survival was 100% for the FS-4, 0% for the jointed goatgrass collection and 6 BC(2)S(2) populations, 40% or less for 2 BC(2)S(2) populations, and 50% or greater for the remaining 10 BC(2)S(2) populations. Chromosome counts in BC(2)S(3) plants showed a restoration of the chromosome number of jointed goatgrass, with four out of four plants examined having 28 chromosomes. Sequencing of AHASL1D in BC(2)S(3) plants derived from BC(2)S(2)-6 revealed the sexual transmission of Imi1 from FS-4 to jointed goatgrass. Imi1 conferred resistance to the imidazolinone herbicide imazamox, as shown by the in vitro assay for acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) activity."

"19322558","abstracttext","Resistance gene H26, derived from Aegilops tauschii Coss., is one of the most effective R genes against the Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)], an important pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Using a limited number of PCR-based molecular markers a previous study mapped H26 to the wheat chromosomal deletion bin 3DL3-0.81-1.00. The objectives of this study were to saturate the chromosomal region harboring H26 with newly developed PCR-based markers and to investigate the collinearity of this wheat chromosomal region with rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon genome. A population of 96 F(2) individuals segregating at the H26 gene locus was used for saturation mapping. All wheat ESTs assigned to the deletion bin 3DL3-0.81-1.00 were used to design STS (sequence tagged site) primers. The wheat ESTs mapped near H26 were further used to BLAST rice and B. distachyon genomic sequences for comparative mapping. To date, 26 newly developed STS markers have been mapped to the chromosomal region spanning the H26 locus. Two of them were mapped 1.0 cM away from the H26 locus. Comparative analysis identified genomic regions on rice chromosome 1 and Brachypodium Super contig 13 which are collinear with the genomic region spanning the H26 locus within the distal region of 3DL. The newly developed STS markers closely linked to H26 will be useful for mapped-based cloning of H26 and marker-assisted selection of this gene in wheat breeding. The results will also enhance understanding of this chromosomal region which contains several other Hessian fly resistance genes."

"17634915","abstracttext","Ppd-D1 on chromosome 2D is the major photoperiod response locus in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). A semi-dominant mutation widely used in the ""green revolution"" converts wheat from a long day (LD) to a photoperiod insensitive (day neutral) plant, providing adaptation to a broad range of environments. Comparative mapping shows Ppd-D1 to be colinear with the Ppd-H1 gene of barley (Hordeum vulgare) which is a member of the pseudo-response regulator (PRR) gene family. To investigate the relationship between wheat and barley photoperiod genes we isolated homologues of Ppd-H1 from a 'Chinese Spring' wheat BAC library and compared them to sequences from other wheat varieties with known Ppd alleles. Varieties with the photoperiod insensitive Ppd-D1a allele which causes early flowering in short (SD) or LDs had a 2 kb deletion upstream of the coding region. This was associated with misexpression of the 2D PRR gene and expression of the key floral regulator FT in SDs, showing that photoperiod insensitivity is due to activation of a known photoperiod pathway irrespective of day length. Five Ppd-D1 alleles were found but only the 2 kb deletion was associated with photoperiod insensitivity. Photoperiod insensitivity can also be conferred by mutation at a homoeologous locus on chromosome 2B (Ppd-B1). No candidate mutation was found in the 2B PRR gene but polymorphism within the 2B PRR gene cosegregated with the Ppd-B1 locus in a doubled haploid population, suggesting that insensitivity on 2B is due to a mutation outside the sequenced region or to a closely linked gene."

"32486195","abstracttext","Early leaf senescence negatively impacts the grain yield in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Induced mutants provide an important resource for mapping and cloning of genes for early leaf senescence . In our previous study, Els2 , a single incomplete dominance gene, that caused early leaf senescence phenotype in the wheat mutant LF2099, had been mapped on the long arm of chromosome 2B. The objective of this study was to develop molecular markers tightly linked to the Els2 gene and construct a high-resolution map surrounding the Els2 gene. Three tightly linked single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were obtained from the Illumina Wheat 90K iSelect SNP genotyping array and converted to Kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) markers. To saturate the Els2 region, the Axiom® Wheat 660K SNP array was used to screen bulked extreme phenotype DNA pools, and 9 KASP markers were developed. For fine mapping of the Els2 gene, these KASP markers and previously identified polymorphic markers were analyzed in a large F 2 population of the LF2099 × Chinese Spring cross. The Els2 gene was located in a 0.24-cM genetic region flanked by the KASP markers AX-111643885 and AX-111128667, which corresponded to a physical interval of 1.61 Mb in the Chinese Spring chromosome 2BL containing 27 predicted genes with high confidence. The study laid a foundation for a map-based clone of the Els2 gene controlling the mutation phenotype and revealing the molecular regulatory mechanism of wheat leaf senescence."

"15659632","abstracttext","To study genome evolution and diversity in barley (Hordeum vulgare), we have sequenced and compared more than 300 kb of sequence spanning the Rph7 leaf rust disease resistance gene in two barley cultivars. Colinearity was restricted to five genic and two intergenic regions representing <35% of the two sequences. In each interval separating the seven conserved regions, the number and type of repetitive elements were completely different between the two homologous sequences, and a single gene was absent in one cultivar. In both cultivars, the nonconserved regions consisted of approximately 53% repetitive sequences mainly represented by long-terminal repeat retrotransposons that have inserted <1 million years ago. PCR-based analysis of intergenic regions at the Rph7 locus and at three other independent loci in 41 H. vulgare lines indicated large haplotype variability in the cultivated barley gene pool. Together, our data indicate rapid and recent divergence at homologous loci in the genome of H. vulgare, possibly providing the molecular mechanism for the generation of high diversity in the barley gene pool. Finally, comparative analysis of the gene composition in barley, wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) suggested massive gene movements at the Rph7 locus in the Triticeae lineage."

The five genes exhibited clear differences in their accumulation pattern in wheat seed and in response to dehydration, low temperature, salinity and ABA. Td29b, Td16 and Td27e gene transcripts accumulate late in embryogenesis as expected for Lea genes, Td11 gene transcripts were present throughout seed development whereas no Td25a gene transcripts were detected in seeds. Drastic changes in the relative levels of Td29b, Td16, Td27e and Td11 transcripts occurred at the shift between the cell expansion and desiccation phases. All genes except the Td11 gene are more highly induced by dehydration in coleorhizae than in coleoptiles. In contrast, response to low temperature, salinity or ABA is higher in coleoptiles than in coleorhizae. Depending on both the gene and on the type of stress, a wide range of induction levels (8- to 100,000-fold) was observed."

The ability of crops to overcome Al toxicity varies among crop species and cultivars. Rye (Secale cereale L.) is the most Al-tolerant species among the Triticeae.

Based on the DNA sequence of a rice (Oryza sativa L.) BAC clone suspected to be syntenic to the Alt3 gene region, we developed two PCR-based codominant markers flanking the gene. These two markers, a sequence-tagged site (STS) marker and a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker, each flanked the Alt3 gene at an approximate distance of 0.4 cM and can be used to facilitate high-resolution mapping of the gene. The markers might also be used for marker-assisted selection in rye or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs to obtain Al-tolerant lines and (or) cultivars."

"25855206","abstracttext","The gene expression chip of a salt-tolerant wheat mutant under salt stress was used to clone a salt-induced gene with unknown functions. This gene was designated as TaSR (Triticum aestivum salt-response gene) and submitted to GenBank under accession number EF580107. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis showed that gene expression was induced by salt stress. Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa) plants expressing TaSR presented higher salt tolerance than the controls, whereas AtSR mutant and RNA interference rice plants were more sensitive to salt. Under salt stress, TaSR reduced Na(+) concentration and improved cellular K(+) and Ca(2+) concentrations; this gene was also localized on the cell membrane. β-Glucuronidase (GUS) staining and GUS fluorescence quantitative determination were conducted through fragmentation cloning of the TaSR promoter. Salt stress-responsive elements were detected at 588-1074 bp upstream of the start codon. GUS quantitative tests of the full-length promoter in different tissues indicated that promoter activity was highest in the leaf under salt stress. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid screening further showed the correlation of TaSR with TaPRK and TaKPP. In vitro phosphorylation of TaSR and TaPRK2697 showed that TaPRK2697 did not phosphorylate TaSR. This study revealed that the novel TaSR may be used to improve plant tolerance to salt stress."
"1360666","articletitle","Toward a cytogenetically based physical map of the wheat genome."
"1360666","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell) is well suited for cytogenetic analysis because the genome, buffered by polyploidy, can tolerate structurally and numerically engineered chromosomes for analysis over infinite generations. This feature of polyploidy can be used in developing a high-resolution, cytogenetically based physical map of the wheat genome. We show that numerous deletions, observed in the progeny of a monosomic addition of a chromosome from Triticum cylindricum in wheat, result from single breakpoints and a concomitant loss of distal fragments. Breakages occurred in euchromatic and heterochromatic regions. Forty-one deletions for chromosomes 7A, 7B, and 7D, and a set of genetically mapped DNA probes, were used to construct physical maps. Recombination was low in proximal chromosomal regions and very high toward the distal ends. Deletion mapping was more efficient than genetic mapping in resolving the order of proximal loci. Despite variation in size and arm ratio, relative gene position was largely conserved among chromosomes 7A, 7B, and 7D and a consensus group 7 physical map was constructed. Several molecularly tagged chromosome regions (MTCRs) of approximately one to a few million base pairs were identified that may be resolved by long-range mapping of DNA fragments. Thus, a cytogenetically based physical map may be used to integrate chromosome and DNA-based maps. The MTCRs may simplify strategies for cloning of agronomically useful genes despite the genetic complexity and the large genome size of wheat."
"8917311","articletitle","Characterization of the calmodulin gene family in wheat: structure, chromosomal location, and evolutionary aspects."
"8917311","abstracttext","Calmodulin is a ubiquitous transducer of calcium signals in eukaryotes. In diploid plant species, several isoforms of calmodulin have been described. Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of calmodulin cDNAs corresponding to 10 genes from hexaploid (bread) wheat (Triticum aestivum). These genes encode three distinct calmodulin isoforms; one isoform is novel in that it lacks a conserved calcium binding site. Based on their nucleotide sequences, the 10 cDNAs were classified into four subfamilies. Using subfamily-specific DNA probes, calmodulin genes were identified and the chromosomal location of each subfamily was determined by Southern analysis of selected aneuploid lines. The data suggest that hexaploid wheat possesses at least 13 calmodulin-related genes. Subfamilies 1 and 2 were both localized to the short arms of homoeologous-group 3 chromosomes; subfamily 2 is located on all three homoeologous short arms (3AS, 3BS and 3DS), whereas subfamily 1 is located only on 3AS and 3BS but not on 3DS. Further analysis revealed that Aegilops tauschii, the presumed diploid donor of the D-genome of hexaploid wheat, lacks a subfamily-1 calmodulin gene homologue, whereas diploid species related to the progenitors of the A and B genomes do contain such genes. Subfamily 3 was localized to the short arm of homoeologous chromosomes 2A, 2B and 2D, and subfamily 4 was mapped to the proximal regions of 4AS, 4BL and 4DL. These findings suggest that the calmodulin genes within each subfamily in hexaploid wheat represent homoeoallelic loci. Furthermore, they also suggest that calmodulin genes diversified into subfamilies before speciation of Triticum and Aegilops diploid species."

In the present study we hybridized three RbcS subfamily-specific probes (for SF-1, SF-2 and SF-3) to total DNA digested with four restriction enzymes and analyzed the RFLP patterns of these subfamilies in eight diploid species of Aegilops and Triticum, and in two tetraploid and one hexaploid species of wheat (the diploid species are the putative progenitors of the polyploid wheats). The three subfamilies varied in their level of polymorphism, with SF-2 being the most polymorphic in all species. In the diploids, the order of polymorphism was SF-2 > SF-3 > SF-1, and in the polyploids SF-2 > SF-1 > SF-3. The RbcS genes of the conserved SF-1 were previously reported to have the highest expression levels in all the wheat tissues studied, indicating a negative correlation between polymorphism and gene expression. Among the diploids, the species with the D and the S genomes were the most polymorphic and the A-genome species were the least polymorphic. The polyploids were less polymorphic than the diploids. Within the polyploids, the A genome was somewhat more polymorphic than the B genome, while the D genome was the most conserved. Among the diploid species with the A genome, the RFLP pattern of T. urartu was closer to that of the A genome of the common wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) than to that of T. monococcum. The pattern in Ae. tauschii was similar to that of the D genome of CS. Only partial resemblance was found between the RFLP patterns of the species with the S genome and the B genome of CS."
"32559326","articletitle","Bread wheat TaSPO11-1 exhibits evolutionarily conserved function in meiotic recombination across distant plant species."
"32559326","abstracttext","The manipulation of meiotic recombination in crops is essential to develop new plant varieties rapidly, helping to produce more cultivars in a sustainable manner. One option is to control the formation and repair of the meiosis-specific DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) that initiate recombination between the homologous chromosomes and ultimately lead to crossovers. These DSBs are introduced by the evolutionarily conserved topoisomerase-like protein SPO11 and associated proteins. Here, we characterized the homoeologous copies of the SPO11-1 protein in hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). The genome contains three SPO11-1 gene copies that exhibit 93-95% identity at the nucleotide level, and clearly the A and D copies originated from the diploid ancestors Triticum urartu and Aegilops tauschii, respectively. Furthermore, phylogenetic analysis of 105 plant genomes revealed a clear partitioning between monocots and dicots, with the seven main motifs being almost fully conserved, even between clades. The functional similarity of the proteins among monocots was confirmed through complementation analysis of the Oryza sativa (rice) spo11-1 mutant by the wheat TaSPO11-1-5D coding sequence. Also, remarkably, although the wheat and Arabidopsis SPO11-1 proteins share only 55% identity and the partner proteins also differ, the TaSPO11-1-5D cDNA significantly restored the fertility of the Arabidopsis spo11-1 mutant, indicating a robust functional conservation of the SPO11-1 protein activity across distant plants. These successful heterologous complementation assays, using both Arabidopsis and rice hosts, are good surrogates to validate the functionality of candidate genes and cDNA, as well as variant constructs, when the transformation and mutant production in wheat is much longer and more tedious."

"12687621","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is derived from a complex hybridization procedure involving three diploid species carrying the A, B and D genomes. The proteome patterns of diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid wheat were analyzed to explore the genome interaction in protein expression. At least two species from each of the diploid and tetraploid were used to compare their proteome maps with a hexaploid wheat cv. Chinese Spring. The ancestral cultivars were selected based on their history of closeness with the cultivated wheat. Proteins were extracted from seed flour and separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) with isoelectric focusing of pH range from 4-10. 2-DE maps of cultivated and ancestral species were analyzed by computer assisted image analyzer. The region of high molecular weight glutenin subunits of hexaploid wheat showed similarity with those of the diploid donors, BB and DD genomes. The omega gliadin, which is controlled by B genome in common wheat, was assumed to have evolved as a result of interaction between AA and BB genomes. The low molecular weight glutenins and alpha and beta gliadin regions were contributed by the three genomes. This result suggests that the function of donor genomes particularly in the expression of proteins in hexaploid wheat is not totally independent; rather it is the product of interactions among the diploid genomes in the hexaploid nuclear constitutions. The expression of nonstorage proteins was affected substantially due to the removal of the D genome from hexaploid constitution. Location of the structural gene controlling one of the alpha amylase inhibitor proteins in the nonstorage protein region was identified in the short arm of chromosome 3D."

"21951468","abstracttext","Barley (Hordeum vulgare) has a much higher content of bioactive substances than wheat (Triticum aestivum). In order to investigate additive and/or synergistic effect(s) on the phytosterol content of barley chromosomes, we used a series of barley chromosome addition lines of common wheat that were produced by normal crossing. In determining the plant sterol levels in 2-week-old seedlings and dry seeds, we found that the level of stigmasterol in the barley chromosome 3 addition (3H) line in the seedlings was 1.5-fold higher than that in the original wheat line and in the other barley chromosome addition lines, but not in the seeds. Simultaneously, we determined the overall expression pattern of genes related to plant sterol biosynthesis in the seedlings of wheat and each addition line to assess the relative expression of each gene in the sterol pathway. Since we elucidated the CYP710A8 (cytochrome P450 subfamily)-encoding sterol C-22 desaturase as a key characteristic for the higher level of stigmasterol, full-length cDNAs of wheat and barley CYP710A8 genes were isolated. These CYP710A8 genes were mapped on chromosome 3 in barley (3H) and wheat (3A, 3B, and 3D), and the expression of CYP710A8 genes increased in the 3H addition line, indicating that it is responsible for stigmasterol accumulation. Overexpression of the CYP710A8 genes in Arabidopsis increased the stigmasterol content but did not alter the total sterol level.

"21882708","abstracttext","Phytohormones and fatty acids (FAs) play important roles in plant resistance to insects and pathogens. In this study, we investigated the similarities and differences in the accumulations of phytohormones and FAs in the resistant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) 'Molly' and the nonhost rice (Oryza sativa L.) 'Niponbare' in responses to Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), larval attacks. Using chemical ionization-gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry, we analyzed the concentrations of 13 phytohomones and FAs at the attack site of wheat and rice plants at 1, 6, 24, or 48 h after the initial attack. Hessian fly attack resulted in increases of salicylic acid (SA), 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid (OPDA), palmitic acid (FA16:0), but a decrease of abscisic acid in both wheat and rice plants. In addition, the accumulation of jasmonic acid (JA) increased, whereas the accumulation of cinnamic acid (CA) decreased in wheat plants, but no changes were observed in the accumulation of JA, and the accumulation of CA increased in rice plants after Hessian fly attack. However, the accumulations of benzoic acid, strearic acid (FA18:0), and oleic acid (FA18:1) increased in rice plants, but no changes were observed in wheat plants after Hessian fly attack. Hessian fly-induced changes were more rapid in wheat plants in comparison with those in rice plants. Our study suggests that SA and OPDA may be involved in resistance of wheat and rice plants to Hessian fly and that the R gene-mediated resistance responses are more rapid than nonhost resistance responses."
"19130033","articletitle","Genetic loci associated with stem elongation and winter dormancy release in wheat."
"19130033","abstracttext","In winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the stem begins to elongate after the vernalization requirement is satisfied during winter and when favorable temperature and photoperiod conditions are attained in spring. In this study, we precisely measured elongation of the first extended internode on 96 recombinant inbred lines of a population that was generated from a cross between two winter wheat cultivars, Jagger (early stem elongation) and 2174 (late stem elongation). We mapped a major locus for stem elongation to the region where VRN-A1 resides in chromosome 5A. Visible assessment of winter dormancy release was concomitantly associated with this locus. VRN1 was previously cloned based on variation in vernalization requirement between spring wheat carrying a dominant Vrn-1 allele and winter wheat carrying a recessive vrn-1 allele. Both of two winter wheat cultivars in this study carry a recessive vrn-A1 allele; therefore, our results suggest that either VRN-A1 might invoke a new regulatory mechanism or a new gene residing close to VRN-A1 plays a regulatory role in winter wheat development. Phenotypic expression of the vrn-A1a allele of Jagger was more sensitive to the year of measurement of stem elongation than that of the vrn-A1b allele of 2174. In addition to QSte.osu.5A, several loci were also found to have minor effects on initial stem elongation of winter wheat. Seventeen of nineteen locally adapted cultivars in the southern Great Plaints contained the vrn-A1b allele. Hence, breeders in this area have inadvertently selected this allele, contributing to later stem elongation and more conducive developmental patterns for grain production."

"21309248","abstracttext","Genetic resistance in wheat, Triticum aestivum L., is the most efficacious method for control of Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). However, because of the appearance of new genotypes (biotypes) in response to deployment of resistance, field collections of Hessian fly need to be evaluated on a regular basis to provide breeders and producers information on the efficacy of resistance (R) genes with respect to the genotype composition of Hessian fly in regional areas. We report here on the efficacy of 21 R genes in wheat to field collections of Hessian fly from the southeastern United States. Results documented that of the 21 R genes evaluated only five would provide effective protection of wheat from Hessian fly in the southeastern United States. These genes were H12, H18, H24, H25, and H26. Although not all of the 33 identified R genes were evaluated in the current study, these results indicate that identified genetic resistance to protect wheat from Hessian attack in the southeastern United States is a limited resource. Historically, R genes for Hessian fly resistance in wheat have been deployed as single gene releases. Although this strategy has been successful in the past, we recommend that in the future deployment of combinations of highly effective previously undeployed genes, such as H24 and H26, be considered. Our study also highlights the need to identify new and effective sources of resistance in wheat to Hessian fly if genetic resistance is to continue as a viable option for protection of wheat in the southeastern United States."

"24716476","abstracttext_background","Monitoring alien introgressions in crop plants is difficult due to the lack of genetic and molecular mapping information on the wild crop relatives. The tertiary gene pool of wheat is a very important source of genetic variability for wheat improvement against biotic and abiotic stresses. By exploring the 5Mg short arm (5MgS) of Aegilops geniculata, we can apply chromosome genomics for the discovery of SNP markers and their use for monitoring alien introgressions in wheat (Triticum aestivum L)."
"24716476","abstracttext_results","The short arm of chromosome 5Mg of Ae. geniculata Roth (syn. Ae. ovata L.; 2n = 4x = 28, UgUgMgMg) was flow-sorted from a wheat line in which it is maintained as a telocentric chromosome. DNA of the sorted arm was amplified and sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 2000 with ~45x coverage. The sequence data was used for SNP discovery against wheat homoeologous group-5 assemblies. A total of 2,178 unique, 5MgS-specific SNPs were discovered. Randomly selected samples of 59 5MgS-specific SNPs were tested (44 by KASPar assay and 15 by Sanger sequencing) and 84% were validated. Of the selected SNPs, 97% mapped to a chromosome 5Mg addition to wheat (the source of t5MgS), and 94% to 5Mg introgressed from a different accession of Ae. geniculata substituting for chromosome 5D of wheat. The validated SNPs also identified chromosome segments of 5MgS origin in a set of T5D-5Mg translocation lines; eight SNPs (25%) mapped to TA5601 [T5DL · 5DS-5MgS(0.75)] and three (8%) to TA5602 [T5DL · 5DS-5MgS (0.95)]. SNPs (gsnp_5ms83 and gsnp_5ms94), tagging chromosome T5DL · 5DS-5MgS(0.95) with the smallest introgression carrying resistance to leaf rust (Lr57) and stripe rust (Yr40), were validated in two released germplasm lines with Lr57 and Yr40 genes."

"26560113","abstracttext","Enhancing drought tolerance of crops has been a great challenge in crop improvement. Here, we report the maize phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) gene was able to confer drought tolerance and increase grain yield in transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants. The improved of drought tolerance was associated with higher levels of proline, soluble sugar, soluble protein, and higher water use efficiency. The transgenic wheat plants had also a more extensive root system as well as increased photosynthetic capacity during stress treatments. The increased grain yield of the transgenic wheat was contributed by improved biomass, larger spike and grain numbers, and heavier 1000-grain weight under drought-stress conditions. Under non-stressed conditions, there were no significant increases in these of the measured traits except for photosynthetic rate when compared with parental wheat. Proteomic research showed that the expression levels of some proteins, including chlorophyll A-B binding protein and pyruvate, phosphate dikinase, which are related to photosynthesis, PAP fibrillin, which is involved in cytoskeleton synthesis, S-adenosylmethionine synthetase, which catalyzes methionine synthesis, were induced in the transgenic wheat under drought stress. Additionally, the expression of glutamine synthetase, which is involved in ammonia assimilation, was induced by drought stress in the wheat. Our study shows that PEPC can improve both stress tolerance and grain yield in wheat, demonstrating the efficacy of PEPC in crop improvement."
"27862842","articletitle","The wheat NB-LRR gene TaRCR1 is required for host defence response to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia cerealis."
"27862842","abstracttext","The necrotrophic fungus Rhizoctonia cerealis is the major pathogen causing sharp eyespot disease in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins often mediate plant disease resistance to biotrophic pathogens. Little is known about the role of NB-LRR genes involved in wheat response to R. cerealis. In this study, a wheat NB-LRR gene, named TaRCR1, was identified in response to R. cerealis infection using Artificial Neural Network analysis based on comparative transcriptomics and its defence role was characterized. The transcriptional level of TaRCR1 was enhanced after R. cerealis inoculation and associated with the resistance level of wheat. TaRCR1 was located on wheat chromosome 3BS and encoded an NB-LRR protein that was consisting of a coiled-coil domain, an NB-ARC domain and 13 imperfect leucine-rich repeats. TaRCR1 was localized in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Silencing of TaRCR1 impaired wheat resistance to R. cerealis, whereas TaRCR1 overexpression significantly increased the resistance in transgenic wheat. TaRCR1 regulated certain reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging and production, and defence-related genes, and peroxidase activity. Furthermore, H 2 O 2 pretreatment for 12-h elevated expression levels of TaRCR1 and the above defence-related genes, whereas treatment with a peroxidase inhibitor for 12 h reduced the resistance of TaRCR1-overexpressing transgenic plants and expression levels of these defence-related genes. Taken together, TaRCR1 positively contributes to defence response to R. cerealis through maintaining ROS homoeostasis and regulating the expression of defence-related genes."

"29589041","abstracttext_key message","Genome-wide association mapping in conjunction with population sequencing map and Ensembl plants was used to identify markers/candidate genes linked to leaf rust, stripe rust and tan spot resistance in wheat. Leaf rust (LR), stripe rust (YR) and tan spot (TS) are some of the important foliar diseases in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To identify candidate resistance genes for these diseases in CIMMYT's (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) International bread wheat screening nurseries, we used genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in conjunction with information from the population sequencing map and Ensembl plants. Wheat entries were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotyped in replicated trials. Using a mixed linear model, we observed that seedling resistance to LR was associated with 12 markers on chromosomes 1DS, 2AS, 2BL, 3B, 4AL, 6AS and 6AL, and seedling resistance to TS was associated with 14 markers on chromosomes 1AS, 2AL, 2BL, 3AS, 3AL, 3B, 6AS and 6AL. Seedling and adult plant resistance (APR) to YR were associated with several markers at the distal end of chromosome 2AS. In addition, YR APR was also associated with markers on chromosomes 2DL, 3B and 7DS. The potential candidate genes for these diseases included several resistance genes, receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinases and defense-related enzymes. However, extensive LD in wheat that decays at about 5 × 10 7  bps, poses a huge challenge for delineating candidate gene intervals and candidates should be further mapped, functionally characterized and validated. We also explored a segment on chromosome 2AS associated with multiple disease resistance and identified seventeen disease resistance linked genes. We conclude that identifying candidate genes linked to significant markers in GWAS is feasible in wheat, thus creating opportunities for accelerating molecular breeding."

"29879900","abstracttext_background","It is known that hexaploid common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has stronger adaptability to many stressful environments than its tetraploid wheat progenitor. However, the physiological basis and evolutionary course to acquire these enhanced adaptabilities by common wheat remain understudied. Here, we aimed to investigate whether and by what means tolerance to low-nitrogen manifested by common wheat may emerge immediately following allohexaploidization."
"29879900","abstracttext_results","We compared traits related to nitrogen (N) metabolism in a synthetic allohexaploid wheat (neo-6×, BBAADD) mimicking natural common wheat, together with its tetraploid (BBAA, 4×) and diploid (DD, 2×) parents. We found that, under low nitrogen condition, neo-6× maintained largely normal photosynthesis, higher shoot N accumulation, and better N assimilation than its 4× and 2× parents. We showed that multiple mechanisms underlie the enhanced tolerance to N-deficiency in neo-6×. At morphological level, neo-6× has higher root/shoot ratio of biomass than its parents, which might be an adaptive growth strategy as more roots feed less shoots with N, thereby enabling higher N accumulation in the shoots. At electrophysiological level, H + efflux in neo-6× is higher than in its 4× parent. A stronger H + efflux may enable a higher N uptake capacity of neo-6×. At gene expression level, neo-6× displayed markedly higher expression levels of critical genes involved in N uptake than both of its 4× and 2× parents."

The complete genomic DNA (gDNA) sequence of two POD genes ( TaPod-A2 and TaPod-D1 ), and the partial gDNA sequence of two additional POD genes ( TaPod-A3 and TaPod-B1 ) from wheat were characterized using in silico cloning and validated through laboratory experiments. Using a set of 21 nullisomic-tetrasomic (NT) lines, six group-7 ditelosomic (Dt) lines, and 38 group-7 deletion (Del) lines of Chinese Spring (CS), TaPod-A2 and TaPod-D1 were found to be physically located on 0.73-0.83 and on the most distal 0.39 fraction arm length (FL) of 7AS and 7DS in cv. CS, respectively; whereas, TaPod-A3 and TaPod-B1 were assigned to the 0.40-0.49 and 0.40-0.48 FL of 7AL and 7BL, respectively. Based on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of two alleles at the TaPod-D1 locus, two functional markers POD-7D1 and POD-7D6 were developed, amplifying 540- and 640-bp, fragments in varieties with higher and lower POD activities, respectively. A total of 224 wheat varieties were analyzed and showed a significant association between the polymorphic fragments and POD activity using POD-7D1 and POD-7D6 markers. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated the average POD activities of 115 varieties with TaPod - D1a were significantly lower than 109 varieties with TaPod - D1b ( P < 0.01).

"31733093","abstracttext","Kernel size is an important trait determining cereal yields. In this study, we cloned and characterized TaDA1, a conserved negative regulator of kernel size in wheat (Triticum aestivum). The overexpression of TaDA1 decreased the size and weight of wheat kernels, while its down-regulation using RNA interference (RNAi) had the opposite effect. Three TaDA1-A haplotypes were identified in Chinese wheat core collections, and a haplotype association analysis showed that TaDA1-A-HapI was significantly correlated with the production of larger kernels and higher kernel weights in modern Chinese cultivars. The haplotype effect resulted from a difference in TaDA1-A expression levels between genotypes, with TaDA1-A-HapI resulting in lower TaDA1-A expression levels. This favourable haplotype was found having been positively selected during wheat breeding over the last century. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TaDA1-A physically interacts with TaGW2-B. The additive effects of TaDA1-A and TaGW2-B on kernel weight were confirmed not only by the phenotypic enhancement arising from the simultaneous down-regulation of TaDA1 and TaGW2 expression, but also by the combinational haplotype effects estimated from multi-environment field data from 348 wheat cultivars. A comparative proteome analysis of developing transgenic and wild-type grains indicated that TaDA1 and TaGW2 are involved in partially overlapping but relatively independent protein regulatory networks. Thus, we have identified an important gene controlling kernel size in wheat and determined its interaction with other genes regulating kernel weight, which could have beneficial applications in wheat breeding."

"31366159","abstracttext","Salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting crop growth and productivity worldwide. Species of Trichoderma are widely recognized for their bio-control abilities, but little information is regarding to the ability and mechanisms of their promoting plant growth and enhancing plant tolerance to different levels of salt stress. Hence, we determined (i) the role of Trichoderma longibrachiatum T6 (TL-6) in promoting wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) seed germination and seedling growth under different levels of salt stress, and (ii) the mechanisms responsible for the enhanced tolerance of wheat to salt stress by TL-6. Wheat seeds treated with or without TL-6 were grown under different levels of salt stress in controlled environmental conditions. As such, the TL-6 treatments promoted seed germination and increased the shoot and root weights of wheat seedlings under both non-stress and salt-stress conditions. Wheat seedlings with TL-6 treatments under different levels of NaCl stress increased proline content by an average of 11%, ascorbate 15%, and glutathione 28%; and decreased the contents of malondialdehyde (MDA) by an average of 19% and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) 13%. The TL-6 treatments induced the transcriptional level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging enzymes, leading to the increases of glutathione s-transferase (GST) by an average of 17%, glutathione peroxidase (GPX) 16%, ascorbate peroxidase (APX) 17%, glutathione reductase (GR) 18%, dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR) 5%. Our results indicate that the beneficial strain of TL-6 effectively scavenged ROS under NaCl stress through modulating the activity of ROS scavenging enzymes, regulating the transcriptional levels of ROS scavenging enzyme gene expression, and enhancing the nonenzymatic antioxidants in wheat seedling in response to salt stress. Our present study provides a new insight into the mechanisms of TL-6 can activate the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense systems and enhance wheat seedling tolerance to different levels of salt stress at physiological, biochemical and molecular levels."

"23563083","abstracttext_unlabelled","Basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3) is involved in the transcriptional initiation of RNA polymerase II and is also associated with apoptosis. In this study, virus-induced gene silencing of TaBTF3 caused severe viral symptoms in wheat seedlings, which then displayed stunted growth, reduced height, and decreased total fresh and dry weights. A proteomic approach was further used to identify the protein species showing differential abundance between the TaBTF3 virus-induced gene silenced wheat plants and the barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing green fluorescent protein transgenic wheat plants (control) with the objective of exploring its regulatory mechanism in higher plants. Using two-dimensional electrophoresis technologies, 59 protein spots showed significant changes, of which 54 were successfully identified by tandem mass spectrometry with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight spectrometry. Analysis of protein abundance revealed that the differential protein species were associated with signal transduction, stress defense, photosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and protein metabolism, and were mostly localized in both chloroplasts and mitochondria. Furthermore, the BTF3-responsive protein interaction network revealed 20 key protein species, most of which are regulated by abscisic acid, ethane, or oxidative stress. This suggested that changes of these protein species could be critical in the BTF3 pathway."
"23563083","abstracttext_biological significance","Basic transcription factor 3 (BTF3), the β-subunit of NAC, has originally been identified as a basic transcription factor that is both involved in the transcriptional initiation of RNA polymerase II and associated with diverse biological functions. Reports on BTF3 mainly focus in animals, however, there has been limited molecular information about BTF3 in higher plants so far. In previous studies, we first isolated the TaBTF3 gene from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and obtained silenced transgenic wheat seedlings using the VIGS method. In TaBTF3-silenced transgenic wheat plants, the structure of the wheat mesophyll cell was seriously damaged and transcripts of the chloroplast- and mitochondrial-encoded genes were significantly reduced. These results suggested that the TaBTF3 gene may be involved in regulating the growth and development of wheat seedlings. However, the induced or related genes by TaBTF3 have not been identified. The significance of this study is to first identify many protein species with the altered abundance between the TaBTF3 virus-induced silencing wheat plants and the BSMV-VIGS GFP transgenic wheat plants (control) using the proteomic approach. In addition, 20 of these identified protein species which might play critical roles in the BTF3 interaction network are identified using protein interaction network.

Southern blot analysis revealed that repetitive DNA elements containing R10hvcop and related sequences were dispersed within the barley chromosomes. Sequences similar to R10hvcop were also found in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), and oat (Avena sativa L.) with copy numbers of 8 x 10(4), 1.39 x 10(5), and 7.9 x 10(4) per haploid genome, respectively. Sequences similar to R10hvcop were also present in the corn (Zea mays L. ssp. mays) genome, but they were not highly repeated. Barley, wheat, rye, oat, and corn showed species-specific restriction fragment length polymorphisms of R10hvcop and related sequences. Computer-based similarity searches revealed that R10hvcop is closely related to reverse transcriptase genes in retrotransposon-like elements of several plant species and of Drosophila. The highly repetitive nature, interspersed distribution, and high degree of similarity to reverse transcriptase genes suggests that R10hvcop contains the sequence of a diverged reverse transcriptase gene."

We analyzed whether CFBPases from different phylogenetic origin contain a common epitope. To this end a DNA fragment of 1200 base pairs encoding 338 amino acid residues of wheat CFBPase (38 kDa) was cloned in the expression plasmid pGEX-1 in frame with the gene coding for glutathione S-transferase (GT) of Schistosoma japonicun (26.5 kDa). Upon transformation of Escherichia coli and induction with isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside, centrifugation of the lysate partitioned 10% of the fusion protein in the supernatant fraction and the remaining 90% in the precipitate. The expected 65 kDa protein was purified from both the soluble and the particulate fraction by affinity chromatography on columns of glutathione-agarose. This fusion protein was successfully used to produce a monoclonal antibody that specifically recognized the CFBPase region of the fusion protein but not the GT moiety. Moreover, the monoclonal antibody immunoreacted not only with polypeptides (ca. 40 kDa) present in leaf crude extracts of other varieties of wheat (Triticum spelta, T. aestivum and T. durum), but also with homogeneous preparations of the spinach (Spinacia oleracea) and rapeseed (Brassica napus) enzymes. Thus, the cross reaction of this monoclonal antibody with counterparts from different plant species indicates the persistency of a common epitope through biological evolution."

"15352871","abstracttext","We performed a structure-function analysis of the plasma membrane-localized plant-specific barley (Hordeum vulgare) MLO (powdery-mildew-resistance gene o) protein. Invariant cysteine and proline residues, located either in extracellular loops or transmembrane domains that have been conserved in MLO proteins for more than 400 million years, were found to be essential for MLO functionality and/or stability. Similarly to many metazoan G-protein-coupled receptors known to function as homo- and hetero-oligomers, FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) analysis revealed evidence for in planta MLO dimerization/oligomerization. Domain-swap experiments with closely related wheat and rice as well as diverged Arabidopsis MLO isoforms demonstrated that the identity of the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail contributes to MLO activity. Likewise, analysis of a progressive deletion series revealed that integrity of the C-terminus determines both MLO accumulation and functionality. A series of domain swaps of cytoplasmic loops with the wheat (Triticum aestivum) orthologue, TaMLO-B1, provided strong evidence for co-operative loop-loop interplay either within the protein or between MLO molecules. Our data indicate extensive intramolecular co-evolution of cytoplasmic domains in the evolutionary history of the MLO protein family."

"12228521","abstracttext","Repression of photosynthetic genes by increased soluble carbohydrate concentrations may explain acclimation of photosynthesis to elevated CO2 concentration. This hypothesis was examined in a field crop of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown at both ambient (approximately 360 [mu]mol mol-1) and elevated (550 [mu]mol mol-1) atmospheric CO2 concentrations using free-air CO2 enrichment at Maricopa, Arizona. The correspondence of steady-state levels of mRNA transcripts (coding for the 83-kD photosystem I apoprotein, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, phosphoribulokinase, phosphoglycerokinase, and the large and small subunits of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) with leaf carbohydrate concentrations (glucose-6-phosphate, glucose, fructose, sucrose, fructans, and starch) was examined at different stages of crop and leaf development and through the diurnal cycle. Overall only a weak correspondence between increased soluble carbohydrate concentrations and decreased levels for nuclear gene transcripts was found. The difference in soluble carbohydrate concentration between leaves grown at elevated and current ambient CO2 concentrations diminished with crop development, whereas the difference in transcript levels increased. In the flag leaf, soluble carbohydrate concentrations declined markedly with the onset of grain filling; yet transcript levels also declined. The results suggest that, whereas the hypothesis may hold well in model laboratory systems, many other factors modified its significance in this field wheat crop."

"16006242","abstracttext","Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) is responsible for the CoA ester-->aldehyde conversion in monolignol biosynthesis, which can divert phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites into the biosynthesis of lignin. To gain a better understanding of lignin biosynthesis in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a cDNA encoding CCR was isolated and named Ta-CCR2. DNA hybridization analyses demonstrated that the Ta-CCR2 gene exists in three copies in the wheat genome. RNA blot hybridization indicated that Ta-CCR2 was expressed most abundantly in root and stem tissues that were in the process of lignification. The secondary and three-dimensional structures of Ta-CCR2 were analyzed by molecular modeling. Recombinant Ta-CCR2 protein purified from E. coli converted feruloyl CoA, 5-OH-feruloyl CoA, sinapoyl CoA and caffeoyl CoA with almost similar efficiency, suggesting that it is involved in both G and S lignin synthesis. Ta-CCR2 had a very low V max value for 4-coumaroyl CoA, which may serve as a mechanism to control metabolic flux to H lignin in vivo . Furthermore, the reaction mechanism of Ta-CCR2 was analyzed in relation to its possible three-dimensional structure. The activity of Ta-CCR2 in relation to lignin biosynthesis is discussed."

"18419817","abstracttext_background","By definition, amyloplasts are plastids specialized for starch production. However, a proteomic study of amyloplasts isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum Butte 86) endosperm at 10 days after anthesis (DPA) detected enzymes from many other metabolic and biosynthetic pathways. To better understand the role of amyloplasts in food production, the data from that study were evaluated in detail and an amyloplast metabolic map was outlined."
"18419817","abstracttext_results","Analysis of 288 proteins detected in an amyloplast preparation predicted that 178 were amyloplast proteins. Criteria included homology with known plastid proteins, prediction of a plastid transit peptide for the wheat gene product or a close homolog, known plastid location of the pathway, and predicted plastid location for other members of the same pathway. Of these, 135 enzymes were arranged into 18 pathways for carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, nucleic acid and other biosynthetic processes that are critical for grain-fill. Functions of the other proteins are also discussed."
"18419817","abstracttext_conclusion","The pathways outlined in this paper suggest that amyloplasts play a central role in endosperm metabolism. The interacting effects of genetics and environment on starch and protein production may be mediated in part by regulatory mechanisms within this organelle."

"18280007","abstracttext","Ubiquitin (Ub) is present in all eukaryotic species examined. It is a multifunctional protein and one of its main known functions is to tag proteins for selective degradation by the 26S proteasome. In this study, Ta-Ub2, a cDNA sequence containing a single Ub repeat and a 3' non-coding region of a polyubiquitin gene, was isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A PBI sense vector with Ta-Ub2 was constructed and transformed into tobacco plants. Ub expression in wheat leaves, monitored by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, responded to drought stress. In transgenic tobacco, determined by protein gel blot analysis, we found higher amounts of Ub-protein conjugates than in control (tobacco carrying a PBI GUS vector without Ta-Ub2) and wild-type (WT) lines. However, free Ub levels did not significantly differ in the 3 genotypes. Seeds from transgenic, Ub-overexpressing tobacco germinated faster and seedlings grew more vigorously than control and WT samples, both under drought and non-drought conditions. Furthermore, CO(2) assimilation of transgenic plants was significantly higher under drought stress. Our results indicate that Ub may be involved in the response of plants to drought stress and that overexpression of monoubiquitin might be an effective strategy for enhancing drought tolerance."

"16278506","abstracttext","Three low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) genes, designated LMW-Td1, LMW-Td2 and LMW-Td3, were isolated from wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides), which is the tetraploid progenitor of common wheat (T. aestivum). The complete nucleotide sequence lengths of LMW-Td1, LMW-Td2 and LMW-Td3 are 858, 900 and 1062 bp, respectively. LMW-Td1 and LMW-Td3 can encode proteins with 284 and 352 amino acid residues, respectively, whereas LMW-Td2 is a putative pseudogene due to the presence of 3 inframe stop codons in its C-terminal domain. The deduced protein sequences of the 3 genes share the same typical polypeptide structures with known LMW-GS genes containing 8 cysteines in the mature protein domains. LMW-Td1 was clearly distinguished from all known LMW-GS genes, and considered as a novel LMW-GS gene. Two hydrophobic motifs (i.e. PIIIL and PVIIL) were observed in the repetitive domain of LMW-Td3. Sequence comparison indicates that sequences of the 3 LMW-GS genes from this study are strongly similar to known LMW-GS genes. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that LMW-Td1 and LMW-Td2 are homologous with genes on chromosome 1A, and LMW-Td3 is closely related to genes on chromosome 1B."

"16189660","abstracttext","Genetic improvement of aluminum (Al) tolerance is one of the cost-effective solutions to improve wheat (Triticum aestivum) productivity in acidic soils. The objectives of the present study were to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for Al-tolerance and associated PCR-based markers for marker-assisted breeding utilizing cultivar Atlas 66. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross Atlas 66/Century was screened for Al-tolerance by measuring root-growth rate during Al treatment in hydroponics and root response to hematoxylin stain of Al treatment. After 797 pairs of SSR primers were screened for polymorphisms between the parents, 131 pairs were selected for bulk segregant analysis (BSA). A QTL analysis based on SSR markers revealed one QTL on the distal region of chromosome arm 4DL where a malate transporter gene was mapped. This major QTL accounted for nearly 50% of the phenotypic variation for Al-tolerance. The SSR markers Xgdm125 and Xwmc331 were the flanking markers for the QTL and have the potential to be used for high-throughput, marker-assisted selection in wheat-breeding programs."

"16636822","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), primarily caused by Fusarium graminearum Schw., is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Although several genes related to FHB resistance have been reported, global analysis of gene expression in response to FHB infection remains to be explored. The expression patterns of transcriptomes from wheat spikes of FHB-resistant cultivar Ning 7840 and susceptible cultivar Clark were monitored during a period of 72 h after inoculation (hai) with F. graminearum. Microarray analysis, coupled with suppression subtractive hybridization technique, identified 44 significantly differentially expressed genes between cv. Ning 7840 and cv. Clark. More differentially expressed genes were identified from susceptible libraries than from resistance libraries. The up-regulation of defense-related genes in Ning 7840 relative to cultivar Clark occurred during early fungal stress (3-12 hai). Three genes, with unknown function that were up-regulated in cv. Ning 7840 at most time points investigated, might play an important role in enhancing FHB resistance."

"15618430","abstracttext","To examine the role of isoamylase1 (ISA1) in amylopectin biosynthesis in plants, a genomic DNA fragment from Aegilops tauschii was introduced into the ISA1-deficient rice (Oryza sativa) sugary-1 mutant line EM914, in which endosperm starch is completely replaced by phytoglycogen. A. tauschii is the D genome donor of wheat (Triticum aestivum), and the introduced fragment effectively included the gene for ISA1 for wheat (TaISA1) that was encoded on the D genome. In TaISA1-expressing rice endosperm, phytoglycogen synthesis was substantially replaced by starch synthesis, leaving only residual levels of phytoglycogen. The levels of residual phytoglycogen present were inversely proportional to the expression level of the TaISA1 protein, although the level of pullulanase that had been reduced in EM914 was restored to the same level as that in the wild type. Small but significant differences were found in the amylopectin chain-length distribution, gelatinization temperatures, and A-type x-ray diffraction patterns of the starches from lines expressing TaISA1 when compared with wild-type rice starch, although in the first two parameters, the effect was proportional to the expression level of TaISA. The impact of expression levels of ISA1 on starch structure and properties provides support for the view that ISA1 is directly involved in the synthesis of amylopectin."

"19018997","abstracttext","Higher plants possess large multigene families encoding secreted class III peroxidase (Prx) proteins. In barley, two Prx cDNAs encoding HvPrx07 and HvPrx08 have been isolated and characterized to some extent with respect to a resistance-mediating function upon attack by the powdery-mildew fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (Bgh). Here we present evidence for the tissue-specific accumulation of a new Prx mRNA, HvPrx40, in Bgh-attacked epidermis of barley (Hordeum vulgare). The encoded protein is predicted to be secreted into the apoplastic space of epidermal cells due to the absence of a C-terminal extension, which distinguishes it from other Prx proteins reported to accumulate in leaf epidermis. Transient overexpression of HvPrx40 enhanced the resistance of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley against Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (wheat powdery mildew) and Bgh, respectively. These findings were complemented by transient-induced gene silencing showing hypersusceptibility of barley leaf epidermal cells to Bgh. The local accumulation of oxidized 3,3-diaminobenzidine that reflects H2O2 production at sites of attempted fungal penetration was not reduced in HvPrx40-silenced cells, suggesting a role of this peroxidase other than the production of reactive oxygen species."

Multi-pathotype tests on 84 wheat cultivars grown in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden during 1992-2002 and 39 differential testers enabled the postulation of nine known genes for seedling resistance to leaf rust. Genes Lr1, Lr2a, Lr3, Lr10, Lr13, Lr14a, Lr17, Lr23 and Lr26 were found singly or in combination in 47 of the cultivars (55.9%). The most frequently occurring genes in cultivars grown in Sweden were Lr13 (20.4%), Lr14a (14.8%) and Lr26 (14.8%). Lr14a was the most common gene in cultivars grown in Norway (18.7%), Lr13 in Denmark (35.5%) and Lr10 in Finland (20.0%). Although 28 cultivars (33.3%) exhibited a response pattern that could not be assigned to resistance genes or combinations present in the tester lines, several pathotypes carried virulence and hence these genes or combinations are of limited use. Nine cultivars (10.7%) lacked detectable seedling resistance. One cultivar was resistant to all pathotypes used in the study."

"18616582","abstracttext","Seasonal shifts in rhizosphere microbial populations were investigated to follow the influence of plant developmental stage. A field study of indigenous microbial rhizosphere communities was undertaken on pea (Pisum satvium var. quincy), wheat (Triticum aestivum var. pena wawa) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris var. amythyst). Rhizosphere community diversity and substrate utilization patterns were followed throughout a growing season, by culturing, rRNA gene density gradient gel electrophoresis and BIOLOG. Culturable bacterial and fungal rhizosphere community densities were stable in pea and wheat rhizospheres, with dynamic shifts observed in the sugar beet rhizosphere. Successional shifts in bacterial and fungal diversity as plants mature demonstrated that different plants select and define their own functional rhizosphere communities. Assessment of metabolic activity and resource utilization by bacterial community-level physiological profiling demonstrated greater similarities between different plant species rhizosphere communities at the same than at different developmental stages. Marked temporal shifts in diversity and relative activity were observed in rhizosphere bacterial communities with developmental stage for all plant species studied. Shifts in the diversity of fungal and bacterial communities were more pronounced in maturing pea and sugar beet plants. This detailed study demonstrates that plant species select for specialized microbial communities that change in response to plant growth and plant inputs."

"19782956","abstracttext","Plant somatic hybridization has progressed steadily over the past 35 years. Many hybrid plants have been generated from fusion combinations of different phylogenetic species, some of which have been utilized in crop breeding programs. Among them, asymmetric hybrid, which usually contains a fraction of alien genome, has received more attention because of its importance in crop improvement. However, few studies have dealt with the heredity of the genome of somatic hybrid for a long time, which has limited the progress of this approach. Over recent ten years, along with the development of an effective cytogenetical tool ""in situ hybridization (ISH)"", asymmetric fusion of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with different grasses or cereals has been greatly developed. Genetics, genomes, functional genes and agricultural traits of wheat asymmetric hybrids have been subject to systematic investigations using gene cloning, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and molecular makers. The future goal is to fully elucidate the functional relationships among improved agronomic traits, the genes and underlying molecular mechanisms, and the genome dynamics of somatic introgression lines. This will accelerate the development of elite germplasms via somatic hybridization and the application of these materials in the molecular improvement of crop plants."

"23762295","abstracttext","WRKY transcription factors are reported to be involved in defense regulation, stress response and plant growth and development. However, the precise role of WRKY transcription factors in abiotic stress tolerance is not completely understood, especially in crops. In this study, we identified and cloned 10 WRKY genes from genome of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). TaWRKY10, a gene induced by multiple stresses, was selected for further investigation. TaWRKY10 was upregulated by treatment with polyethylene glycol, NaCl, cold and H2O2. Result of Southern blot indicates that the wheat genome contains three copies of TaWRKY10. The TaWRKY10 protein is localized in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional activator. Overexpression of TaWRKY10 in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) resulted in enhanced drought and salt stress tolerance, mainly demonstrated by the transgenic plants exhibiting of increased germination rate, root length, survival rate, and relative water content under these stress conditions. Further investigation showed that transgenic plants also retained higher proline and soluble sugar contents, and lower reactive oxygen species and malonaldehyde contents. Moreover, overexpression of the TaWRKY10 regulated the expression of a series of stress related genes. Taken together, our results indicate that TaWRKY10 functions as a positive factor under drought and salt stresses by regulating the osmotic balance, ROS scavenging and transcription of stress related genes."

Elevated cytokinin level has been maintained only in the presence of EBR, while the hormone removal has led to return of cytokinin concentration to the control level initially in the roots and then in the shoots. EBR-induced accumulation of cytokinins was accompanied by inhibition of both cytokinin oxidase (CKX) (cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase, EC 1.5.99.12) activity and expression of the gene coding for this enzyme, and on the contrary the decline in CKs level resulted in increase in these characteristics up to the control level in roots and then in shoots. Sharp accumulation of cytokinin O-glucosides has been discovered in response to EBR-treatment suggesting fast EBR-induced activation of production of cytokinins, which excessive amounts were transferred into the storage forms. The obtained data provide evidence for the involvement of EBR in regulation of cytokinin level in wheat seedlings."

"21457369","abstracttext","In contrast to animals, the life cycle of higher plants alternates between a gamete-producing (gametophyte) and a spore-producing (sporophyte) generation. The female gametophyte of angiosperms consists of four distinct cell types, including two gametes, the egg and the central cell, which give rise to embryo and endosperm, respectively. Based on a combined subtractive hybridization and virtual subtraction approach in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we have isolated a class of transcription factors not found in animal genomes, the RKD (RWP-RK domain-containing) factors, which share a highly conserved RWP-RK domain. Single-cell RT-PCR revealed that the genes TaRKD1 and TaRKD2 are preferentially expressed in the egg cell of wheat. The Arabidopsis genome contains five RKD genes, at least two of them, AtRKD1 and AtRKD2, are preferentially expressed in the egg cell of Arabidopsis. Ectopic expression of the AtRKD1 and AtRKD2 genes induces cell proliferation and the expression of an egg cell marker. Analyses of RKD-induced proliferating cells exhibit a shift of gene expression towards an egg cell-like transcriptome. Promoters of selected RKD-induced genes were shown to be predominantly active in the egg cell and can be activated by RKD in a transient protoplast expression assay. The data show that egg cell-specific RKD factors control a transcriptional program, which is characteristic for plant egg cells."

"21076511","abstracttext","Aluminium (Al3+) toxicity restricts productivity and profitability of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops grown on acid soils worldwide. Continued gains will be obtained by identifying superior alleles and novel Al3+ resistance loci that can be incorporated into breeding programs. We used association mapping to identify genomic regions associated with Al3+ resistance using 1055 accessions of common wheat from different geographic regions of the world and 178 polymorphic diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers. Bayesian analyses based on genetic distance matrices classified these accessions into 12 subgroups. Genome-wide association analyses detected markers that were significantly associated with Al3+ resistance on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 4A, 4B, 4D, 5B, 6A, 6B, 7A, and 7B. Some of these genomic regions correspond to previously identified loci for Al3+ resistance, whereas others appear to be novel. Among the markers targeting TaALMT1 (the major Al3+-resistance gene located on chromosome 4D), those that detected alleles in the promoter explained most of the phenotypic variance for Al3+ resistance, which is consistent with this region controlling the level of TaALMT1 expression. These results demonstrate that genome-wide association mapping cannot only confirm known Al3+-resistance loci, such as those on chromosomes 4D and 4B, but they also highlight the utility of this technique in identifying novel resistance loci."

"19902245","abstracttext","A symmetric somatic hybridization was performed to combine the protoplasts of tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Fertile regenerants were obtained which were morphologically similar to tall wheatgrass, but which contained some introgression segments from wheat. An SDS-PAGE analysis showed that a number of non-parental high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) were present in the symmetric somatic hybridization derivatives. These sequences were amplified, cloned and sequenced, to deliver 14 distinct HMW-GS coding sequences, eight of which were of the y-type (Hy1-Hy8) and six x-type (Hx1-Hx6). Five of the cloned HMW-GS sequences were successfully expressed in E. coli. The analysis of their deduced peptide sequences showed that they all possessed the typical HMW-GS primary structure. Sequence alignments indicated that Hx5 and Hy1 were probably derived from the tall wheatgrass genes Aex5 and Aey6, while Hy2, Hy3, Hx1 and Hy6 may have resulted from slippage in the replication of a related biparental gene. We found that both symmetric and asymmetric somatic hybridization could promote the emergence of novel alleles. We discussed the origination of allelic variation of HMW-GS genes in somatic hybridization, which might be the result from the response to genomic shock triggered by the merger and interaction of biparent genomes."

WRKY genes have been found to be responsive to abiotic stresses; however, their roles in abiotic stress tolerance are largely unknown especially in crops. Here, we identified stress-responsive WRKY genes from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and studied their functions in stress tolerance. Forty-three putative TaWRKY genes were identified and two multiple stress-induced genes, TaWRKY2 and TaWRKY19, were further characterized. TaWRKY2 and TaWRKY19 are nuclear proteins, and displayed specific binding to typical cis-element W box. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaWRKY2 exhibited salt and drought tolerance compared with controls. Overexpression of TaWRKY19 conferred tolerance to salt, drought and freezing stresses in transgenic plants. TaWRKY2 enhanced expressions of STZ and RD29B, and bound to their promoters. TaWRKY19 activated expressions of DREB2A, RD29A, RD29B and Cor6.6, and bound to DREB2A and Cor6.6 promoters. The two TaWRKY proteins may regulate the downstream genes through direct binding to the gene promoter or via indirect mechanism. Manipulation of TaWRKY2 and TaWRKY19 in wheat or other crops should improve their performance under various abiotic stress conditions."

"22381655","abstracttext","Expansins are proteins that are generally accepted to be key regulators of cell wall extension and plant growth. We examined the expression pattern of TaEXPB23, a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) expansin gene, under exogenous phytohormone and abiotic stress treatments. In addition, we evaluated its function in the tolerance to salt stress and high temperature (HT) by overexpressing it in transgenic tobacco plants. In subcellular localization assays, TaEXPB23 localized to the cell wall. Expression analysis demonstrated that the transcription pattern of TaEXPB23 corresponded to wheat coleoptile growth. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that TaEXPB23 transcript expression was upregulated by exogenous methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salt stress, but downregulated by exogenous gibberellins (GA₃), ethylene (ET), indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and α-naphthlcetic acid (NAA). Overexpression of TaEXPB23 in tobacco (tabacum) conferred tolerance to salt stress by enhancing water retention ability (WRA) and decreasing osmotic potential (OP). However, transgenic plants overexpressing TaEXPB23 did not show any improvement in the tolerance to HT stress. These results suggested that TaEXPB23 is regulated by phytohormones and is involved in the regulation of salt stress tolerance."

"23321418","abstracttext","The 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases (OPRs) are classified into the two subgroups OPRI and OPRII. The latter proteins participate in jasmonic acid synthesis, while the function of the former ones is as yet unclear. We describe here the characterization of the OPRI gene TaOPR1, isolated from the salinity-tolerant bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar SR3. Salinity stress induced a higher level of TaOPR1 expression in the seedling roots of cv SR3 than in its parental cultivar, JN177. This induction was abolished when abscisic acid (ABA) synthesis was inhibited. The overexpression of TaOPR1 in wheat significantly enhanced the level of salinity tolerance, while its heterologous expression in Arabidopsis alleviated root growth restriction in the presence of salinity and oxidants and raised the sensitivity to ABA. In Arabidopsis, TaOPR1 promoted ABA synthesis and the ABA-dependent stress-responsive pathway, partially rescued the sensitivity of the Arabidopsis aba2 mutant defective in ABA synthesis to salinity, and improved the activities of reactive oxygen species scavengers and the transcription of their encoding genes while reducing malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species levels. TaOPR1 did not interact with jasmonate synthesis or the jasmonate signaling pathway. Rather than serving purely as an antioxidant, we believe that TaOPR1 acts during episodes of abiotic stress response as a signaling compound associated with the regulation of the ABA-mediated signaling network."

"23116711","abstracttext","Ta-JA1 is a jacalin-like lectin from wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants. To date, its homologs are only observed in the Gramineae family. Our previous experiments have demonstrated that Ta-JA1 contains a modular structure consisting of an N-terminal dirigent domain and a C-terminal jacalin-related lectin domain (JRL) and this protein exhibits a mannose-specific lectin activity. The over-expression of Ta-JA1 gene provides transgenic plants a broad-spectrum resistance to diseases. Here, we report the differential activities of the dirigent and JRL domains of Ta-JA1. In vitro assay showed that the recombinant JRL domain could effectively agglutinate rabbit erythrocytes and pathogen bacteria Pseudomonas syringe pv tabaci. These hemagglutination activities could be inhibited by mannose but not by galactose. In contrast, the recombinant dirigent domain did not show agglutination activity. Corresponding to these differentiations of activities, similar to full-length of Ta-JA1, the over-expression of JRL domain in transgenic plants also increased resistance to the infection of P. syringe. Unlike JRL, the over-expression of dirigent domain in transgenic plants led to alteration of the seedling sensitivity to salts. In addition, a d(N)/d(S) ratio analysis of Ta-JA1 and its related proteins showed that this protein family functionally limited to a few crop plants, such as maize, rice and wheat."

A stress-inducible type II PI4K gene, named TaPI4KIIγ, was obtained by de novo transcriptome sequencing of drought-treated wheat (Triticum aestivum). TaPI4KIIγ, localized on the plasma membrane, underwent threonine autophosphorylation, but had no detectable lipid kinase activity. Interaction of TaPI4KIIγ with wheat ubiquitin fusion degradation protein (TaUDF1) indicated that it might be hydrolysed by the proteinase system. Overexpression of TaPI4KIIγ revealed that it could enhance drought and salt stress tolerance during seed germination and seedling growth. A ubdkγ7 mutant, identified as an orthologue of TaPI4KIIγ in Arabidopsis, was sensitive to salt, polyethylene glycol (PEG), and abscisic acid (ABA), and overexpression of TaPI4KIIγ in the ubdkγ7 mutant compensated stress sensitivity. TaPI4KIIγ promoted root growth in Arabidopsis, suggesting that TaPI4KIIγ might enhance stress resistance by improving root growth. Overexpression of TaPI4KIIγ led to an altered expression level of stress-related genes and changes in several physiological traits that made the plants more tolerant to stress. The results provided evidence that overexpression of TaPI4KIIγ could improve drought and salt tolerance."

"24728647","abstracttext","Chemical mutagenesis efficiently generates phenotypic variation in otherwise homogeneous genetic backgrounds, enabling functional analysis of genes. Advances in mutation detection have brought the utility of induced mutant populations on par with those produced by insertional mutagenesis, but systematic cataloguing of mutations would further increase their utility. We examined the suitability of multiplexed global exome capture and sequencing coupled with custom-developed bioinformatics tools to identify mutations in well-characterized mutant populations of rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). In rice, we identified ∼18,000 induced mutations from 72 independent M2 individuals. Functional evaluation indicated the recovery of potentially deleterious mutations for >2600 genes. We further observed that specific sequence and cytosine methylation patterns surrounding the targeted guanine residues strongly affect their probability to be alkylated by ethyl methanesulfonate. Application of these methods to six independent M2 lines of tetraploid wheat demonstrated that our bioinformatics pipeline is applicable to polyploids. In conclusion, we provide a method for developing large-scale induced mutation resources with relatively small investments that is applicable to resource-poor organisms. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that large libraries of sequenced mutations can be readily generated, providing enhanced opportunities to study gene function and assess the effect of sequence and chromatin context on mutations."

"24615031","abstracttext","In this study, a new disomic addition line, 12-5-2, with 44 chromosomes that was derived from BC3F2 descendants of the hybridization between Triticum aestivum cv. CN19 and Aegilops biuncialis was created and reported. 12-5-2 was immune to both powdery mildew and stripe rust and has stable fertility. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and C-banding revealed that 12-5-2 was a 1U(b) disomic addition line (ADL1U(b)). The seed storage protein electrophoresis showed that 12-5-2 presented all high molecular weight glutenin subunits (7 + 8 and 2 + 12) of CN19 and 2 new subunits that were designated Ux and Uy. Additionally, the flour quality parameters showed that the protein content, Zeleny sedimentation value, wet gluten content, and grain hardness of 12-5-2 were significantly higher than those of its parent CN19. Moreover, 5 pairs of the chromosome 1U(b)-specific polymerase chain reaction-based landmark unique gene markers, TNAC1021, TNAC1041, TNAC1071, TNAC1-01, and TNAC1-04, were also obtained. The new ADL1U(b) 12-5-2 could be a valuable source for wheat improvement, especially for wheat end-product quality and resistance to disease."

"24278269","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) has a large and highly repetitive genome which poses major technical challenges for its study. To aid map-based cloning and future genome sequencing projects, we constructed a BAC-based physical map of the short arm of wheat chromosome 1A (1AS). From the assembly of 25,918 high information content (HICF) fingerprints from a 1AS-specific BAC library, 715 physical contigs were produced that cover almost 99% of the estimated size of the chromosome arm. The 3,414 BAC clones constituting the minimum tiling path were end-sequenced. Using a gene microarray containing ∼40 K NCBI UniGene EST clusters, PCR marker screening and BAC end sequences, we arranged 160 physical contigs (97 Mb or 35.3% of the chromosome arm) in a virtual order based on synteny with Brachypodium, rice and sorghum. BAC end sequences and information from microarray hybridisation was used to anchor 3.8 Mbp of Illumina sequences from flow-sorted chromosome 1AS to BAC contigs. Comparison of genetic and synteny-based physical maps indicated that ∼50% of all genetic recombination is confined to 14% of the physical length of the chromosome arm in the distal region. The 1AS physical map provides a framework for future genetic mapping projects as well as the basis for complete sequencing of chromosome arm 1AS."

"24306488","abstracttext","Combining ability studies for grain yield and its primary component traits in diallel crosses involving seven diverse wheat cultivars of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) over generations F1-F5 are reported. The general and specific combining ability variances were significant in all generations for all the traits except specific combining ability variance for number of spikes per plant in the F5. The ratio of general to specific combining ability variances was significant for all the traits except grain yield in all the generations. This indicated an equal role of additive and non-additive gene effects in the inheritance of grain yield, and the predominance of the former for its component traits. The presence of significant specific combining ability variances in even the advanced generations may be the result of an additive x additive type of epistasis or evolutionary divergence among progenies in the same parental array. The relative breeding values of the parental varieties, as indicated by their general combining ability effects, did not vary much over the generations. The cheap and reliable procedure observed for making the choice of parents, selecting hybrids and predicting advanced generation (F5) bulk hybrid performance was the determination of breeding values of the parents on the relative performance of their F2 progeny bulks."

"24388522","abstracttext","More than half of spring wheat cultivars have a dominant Vrn-A1a allele that has an insertion of a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) in its promoter. In this study, we found that the MITE present in the Vrn-A1a gene (MITE_VRN) is a nearly perfect palindrome and it can form highly stable hairpin loops when expressed as RNA. MITE_VRN also possessed sequences of a microRNA in Triticum aestivum (TamiR1123). The P(32) labeled TamiR1123 probe detected two RNA molecules on a small RNA gel blot, one expected for MITE_VRN, and the other expected for TamiR1123. These results demonstrated that MITE_VRN was expressed as RNAs and TamiR1123 was originated from the MITE_VRN family. The isogenic line TDD carrying the dominant Vrn-A1a allele with MITE_VRN showed higher TamiR1123 and Vrn-A1a transcript levels than the isogenic line TDE carrying the recessive vrn-A1a allele without MITE_VRN. TamiR1123 were greatly up-regulated by plant age but slightly down-regulated by low temperature and short days. These findings have pointed to alternative regulatory mechanisms for plant development governed by Vrn-A1a in spring wheat."

"24193782","abstracttext","Protoplasts isolated from embryogenic ('Mustang' and 'Chinese Spring') and non-embryogenic ('Mit') calli of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes transiently expressed β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity when electroporated with a plasmid containing the GUS gene and driven by an enhanced 35S promoter and a TMV leader sequence. Conditions for the maximum expression of GUS activity were: electroporation of the freshly isolated protoplasts at 250 Vcm(-1) and 250 μF for 2 s using 50 μg/ml of plasmid DNA; incubation of the protoplasts with the plasmid before the pulse for 2 h; and a 15-min recovery period on ice after the pulse. In general, a higher GUS activity was obtained in protoplasts of non-embryogenic (NE) callus origin than in those of embryogenic (E) callus origin. Only GUS constructs containing a duplicate 35S promoter derivative resulted in a significant level of GUS expression. The presence of the TMV viral leader sequence in the pAGUS1-TN2 plasmid construct resulted in a significant increase of GUS activity in the electroporated protoplasts of both callus types. On the other hand, protoplasts electroporated with the Adh1 promoter and intron showed a threefold less GUS activity than those electroporated with pAGUS1-TN2. Optimized conditions for DNA uptake and expression were very similar for protoplasts of both callus types. The importance of these findings for the successful regeneration of transgenic and fertile wheat plants is discussed."

"24982945","abstracttext","Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) are of great importance in processing quality and participate in the formation of polymers in wheat. In this study, eight new LMW-GS alleles were isolated from Chinese wheat landraces (Triticum aestivum L.) and designated as Glu-A3-1a, Glu-A3-1b, Glu-B3-1a, Glu-B3-1b, Glu-B3-1c, Glu-D3-1a, Glu-D3-1b, and Glu-D3-1c, which were located at the Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3 loci, respectively. Based on the proteins encoded, the number of deduced amino acids of Glu-B3 alleles was approximately 50 more than those of Glu-A3 and Glu-D3 alleles. The first cysteine of Glu-A3 and Glu-D3 alleles was located at the N-terminal domain, while that of Glu-B3 alleles was found in the repetitive domain, which may lead to the different functioning in forming disulfide bonds. All the eight genes were LMW-m types and the new allele of Glu-B3-1a which had nine cysteine residues may be the desirable LMW-GS gene for improving bread-making quality."
"25996785","articletitle","Transcriptional and metabolic alternations rebalance wheat grain storage protein accumulation under variable nitrogen and sulfur supply."
"25996785","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain storage proteins (GSPs) are major determinants of flour end-use value. Biological and molecular mechanisms underlying the developmental and nutritional determination of GSP accumulation in cereals are as yet poorly understood. Here we timed the accumulation of GSPs during wheat grain maturation relative to changes in metabolite and transcript pools in different conditions of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) availability. We found that the N/S supply ratio modulated the duration of accumulation of S-rich GSPs and the rate of accumulation of S-poor GSPs. These changes are likely to be the result of distinct relationships between N and S allocation, depending on the S content of the GSP. Most developmental and nutritional modifications in GSP synthesis correlated with the abundance of structural gene transcripts. Changes in the expression of transport and metabolism genes altered the concentrations of several free amino acids under variable conditions of N and S supply, and these amino acids seem to be essential in determining GSP expression. The comprehensive data set generated and analyzed here provides insights that will be useful in adapting fertilizer use to variable N and S supply, or for breeding new cultivars with balanced and robust GSP composition."
"25798624","articletitle","Post-flowering nitrate uptake in wheat is controlled by N status at flowering, with a putative major role of root nitrate transporter NRT2.1."
"25798624","abstracttext","In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the simultaneous improvement of both yield and grain protein is difficult because of the strong negative relationship between these two traits. However, some genotypes deviate positively from this relationship and this has been linked to their ability to take up nitrogen (N) during the post-flowering period, regardless of their N status at flowering. The physiological and genetic determinants of post-flowering N uptake relating to N satiety are poorly understood. This study uses semi-hydroponic culture of cv. Récital under controlled conditions to explore these controls. The first objective was to record the effects of contrasting N status at flowering on post-flowering nitrate (NO₃⁻) uptake under non-limiting NO₃⁻ conditions, while following the expression of key genes involved in NO₃⁻ uptake and assimilation. We found that post-flowering NO₃⁻ uptake was strongly influenced by plant N status at flowering during the first 300-400 degree-days after flowering, overlapping with a probable regulation of nitrate uptake exerted by N demand for growth. The uptake of NO₃⁻ correlated well with the expression of the gene TaNRT2.1, coding for a root NO₃⁻ transporter, which seems to play a major role in post-flowering NO₃⁻ uptake. These results provide a useful knowledge base for future investigation of genetic variability in post-flowering N uptake and may lead to concomitant gains in both grain yield and grain protein in wheat."

"25740921","abstracttext","Seedling root traits of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) have been shown to be important for efficient establishment and linked to mature plant traits such as height and yield. A root phenotyping pipeline, consisting of a germination paper-based screen combined with image segmentation and analysis software, was developed and used to characterize seedling traits in 94 doubled haploid progeny derived from a cross between the winter wheat cultivars Rialto and Savannah. Field experiments were conducted to measure mature plant height, grain yield, and nitrogen (N) uptake in three sites over 2 years. In total, 29 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seedling root traits were identified. Two QTLs for grain yield and N uptake co-localize with root QTLs on chromosomes 2B and 7D, respectively. Of the 29 root QTLs identified, 11 were found to co-localize on 6D, with four of these achieving highly significant logarithm of odds scores (>20). These results suggest the presence of a major-effect gene regulating seedling root vigour/growth on chromosome 6D."

"26884722","abstracttext","AREB (ABA response element binding) proteins in plants play direct regulatory roles in response to multiple stresses, but their functions in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are not clear. In the present study, TaAREB3, a new member of the AREB transcription factor family, was isolated from wheat. Sequence analysis showed that the TaAREB3 protein is composed of three parts, a conserved N-terminal, a variable M region, and a conserved C-terminal with a bZIP domain. It belongs to the group A subfamily of bZIP transcription factors. TaAREB3 was constitutively expressed in stems, leaves, florets, anthers, pistils, seeds, and most highly, in roots. TaAREB3 gene expression was induced with abscisic acid (ABA) and low temperature stress, and its protein was localized in the nucleus when transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells and stably expressed in transgenic Arabidopsis. TaAREB3 protein has transcriptional activation activity, and can bind to the ABRE cis-element in vitro. Overexpression of TaAREB3 in Arabidopsis not only enhanced ABA sensitivity, but also strengthened drought and freezing tolerances. TaAREB3 also activated RD29A, RD29B, COR15A, and COR47 by binding to their promoter regions in transgenic Arabidopsis. These results demonstrated that TaAREB3 plays an important role in drought and freezing tolerances in Arabidopsis."

"26412936","abstracttext","Twenty elite varieties of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), primarily winter wheat, were grown with low and high supplies of nitrogen (N) in a field experiment at Rothamsted, southern England, in the season 2004-05. The aim was to quantify genetic variation in the uptake, partitioning and remobilisation of N in individual plant organs at extreme rates of N supply. The biggest contibutor to variation in plant and crop performance was 'N-rate' followed by 'growth stage' and then 'genotype'. At both N-rates, there was significant genetic variation in crop performance (grain yield, grain %N, total N-uptake and post-anthesis N-uptake), and in N contents of individual organs at anthesis and maturity, and in N remobilised from individual vegetative organs to the grain during grain-fill. Nitrogen was remobilised from all vegetative organs with very high levels of efficiency by all varieties (80-85%). Stem-N was a major N pool at anthesis probably due to the amounts of soluble N compounds in transit in the vascular system at this time. Despite the genetic variation in N-related plant parameters including stem-N, there were no strong correlations with grain yield and grain %N at a given N-rate. This was probably due to the narrow gene pool employed in this single-season study."

Comparative transcriptome analysis of purple (cv Gy115) and white pericarps was carried out using next-generation sequencing technology. There were 23,642 unigenes significantly differentially expressed in the purple and white pericarps, including 9945 up-regulated and 13,697 down-regulated. The differentially expressed unigenes were mainly involved in encoding components of metabolic pathways, The flavonoid biosynthesis pathway was the most represented in metabolic pathways. In the transcriptome of purple pericarp in Gy115, most structural and regulatory genes biosynthesizing anthocyanin were identified, and had higher expression levels than in white pericarp. The largestunigene of anthocyanin biosynthesis in Gy115 was longer than the reference genes, which implies that high-throughput sequencing could isolate the genes of anthocyanin biosynthesis in tissues or organs with high anthocyanin content. Based on present and previous results, three unigenes of MYB gene on chromosome 7BL and three unigenes of MYC on chromosome 2AL were predicted as candidate genes for the purple grain trait. This article was the first to provide a systematic overview comparing the transcriptomes of purple and white pericarps in common wheat, which should be very valuable for identifying the key genes for the purple pericarp trait."

"29223332","abstracttext","MYB transcription factors are involved in the regulation of plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stress. In this study, TaMyb1D, a novel subgroup 4 gene of the R2R3-MYB subfamily, was cloned from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). TaMyb1D was localized in the nucleus and functioned as a transcriptional repressor. The overexpression of TaMyb1D in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants repressed the expression of genes related to phenylpropanoid metabolism and down-regulated the accumulation of lignin in stems and flavonoids in leaves. These changes affected plant development under normal conditions. The expression of TaMyb1D was ubiquitous and up-regulated by PEG6000 and H 2 O 2 treatments in wheat. TaMyb1D-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants exhibited higher relative water content and lower water loss rate during drought stress, as well as higher chlorophyll content in leaves during oxidative stress. The transgenic plants showed a lower leakage of ions as well as reduced malondialdehyde and H 2 O 2 levels during conditions of drought and oxidative stresses. In addition, TaMyb1D up-regulated the expression levels of ROS- and stress-related genes in response to drought stress. Therefore, the overexpression of TaMyb1D enhanced tolerance to drought and oxidative stresses in tobacco plants. Our study demonstrates that TaMyb1D functions as a negative regulator of phenylpropanoid metabolism and a positive regulator of plant tolerance to drought and oxidative stresses."

"28615669","abstracttext","Heat stress, a major abiotic stressor of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), often results in reduced yield and decreased quality. In this study, a proteomic method, Tags for Relative and Absolute Quantitation Isobaric (iTRAQ), was adopted to analyze the protein expression profile changes among wheat cultivar Jing411 under heat stress. Results indicated that there were 256 different proteins expressed in Jing411 under heat stress. According to the result of gene annotation and functional classification, 239 proteins were annotated by 856 GO function entries, including growth and metabolism proteins, energy metabolism proteins, processing and storage proteins, defense-related proteins, signal transduction, unknown function proteins and hypothetical proteins. GO enrichment analysis suggested that the differentially expressed proteins in Jing411 under heat stress were mainly involved in stimulus response (67), abiotic stress response (26) and stress response (58), kinase activity (12), and transferase activity (12). Among the differentially expressed proteins in Jing411, 115 were attributed to 119 KEGG signaling/metabolic pathways. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis in Jing411 showed that heat stress mainly affected the starch and sucrose metabolism as well as protein synthesis pathway in the endoplasmic reticulum. The protein interaction network indicated that there were 8 differentially expressed proteins that could form an interaction network in Jing411."

"29351891","abstracttext","The basic leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins play important roles against abiotic stress in plants, including cold stress. However, most bZIPs involved in plant freezing tolerance are positive regulators. Only a few bZIPs function negatively in cold stress response. In this study, TabZIP6, a Group C bZIP transcription factor gene from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), was cloned and characterized. The transcript of TabZIP6 was strongly induced by cold treatment (4 °C). TabZIP6 is a nuclear-localized protein with transcriptional activation activity. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TabZIP6 showed decreased tolerance to freezing stress. Microarray as well as quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis showed that CBFs and some key COR genes, including COR47 and COR15B, were down-regulated by cold treatment in TabZIP6-overexpressing Arabidopsis lines. TabZIP6 was capable of binding to the G-box motif and the CBF1 and CBF3 promoters in yeast cells. A yeast two-hybrid assay revealed that TabZIP6, as well as the other two Group S bZIP proteins involved in cold stress tolerance in wheat, Wlip19 and TaOBF1, can form homodimers by themselves and heterodimers with each other. These results suggest that TabZIP6 may function negatively in the cold stress response by binding to the promoters of CBFs, and thereby decreasing the expression of downstream COR genes in TabZIP6-overexpressing Arabidopsis seedlings."

"29538315","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), mainly caused by Fusarium graminearum , is one of the most destructive fungal diseases of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Because of the quantitative nature of FHB resistance, its mechanism is poorly understood. We conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis to identify genes that are differentially expressed in FHB-resistant and FHB-susceptible wheat lines grown under field conditions for various periods after F. graminearum infection and determined the chromosomal distribution of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). For each line, the expression in the spike (which exhibits symptoms in the infected plants) was compared with that in the flag leaves (which do not exhibit symptoms in the infected plants). We identified an island of 53 constitutive DEGs in a 140 kb region with high homology to the FhbL693b region on chromosome 3B. Of these genes, 13 were assigned to specific chloroplast-related pathways. Furthermore, one gene encoded inositol monophosphate (IMPa) and two genes encoded ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). Our findings suggest that the temporary susceptibility in locally infected spikes results from the cross-talk between RuBisCO and IMPa, which blocks secondary signaling pathways mediated by salicylic acid and induces a systemic acquired resistance in the distant leaf tissue."

"29093532","abstracttext","Weed control in wheat is one of the major goals of farmers in their efforts toward obtaining the highest crop yields for human foods. Several studies (dose-response, enzyme activity, absorption-translocation and metabolism) were conducted to characterize the resistance level of two new wheat cultivars called Rafalín (Triticum aestivum) and Antoñín (T. durum) that were obtained by conventional breeding based on Clearfield® technology; they are resistant (R) to imazamox compared to their sensitive (S) counterparts (Gazul and Simeto, respectively). The R-cultivars were 93.7-fold (Rafalín) and 43.7-fold (Antoñín) more resistant than their respective S-cultivars. The acetolactate synthase (ALS) enzyme activity revealed high resistance to imidazolinone (IMI) herbicides in R-cultivars, but no cross-resistance to other ALS herbicides was found. The Ser653Asn mutation that confers resistance to IMI herbicides was identified in the imi1 and imi2 genes of Rafalín and only in the imi1 gene of Antoñín. The 14 C-imazamox absorption did not differ between the R- and S-cultivars. Imazamox was metabolized by Cyt-P450 into imazamox-hydroxyl and imazamox-glucoside in the R-cultivars, altering their translocation patterns. The differential sensitivity to imazamox between R-cultivars was due to the number of resistance genes that carry each genotype. The R-cultivars Rafalín and Antoñín could be excellent weed control tools."

"32652543","abstracttext","Improving salinity tolerance in the most widely cultivated cereal, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), is essential to increase grain yields on saline agricultural lands. A Portuguese landrace, Mocho de Espiga Branca accumulates up to sixfold greater leaf and sheath sodium (Na + ) than two Australian cultivars, Gladius and Scout, under salt stress in hydroponics. Despite high leaf and sheath Na + concentrations, Mocho de Espiga Branca maintained similar salinity tolerance compared to Gladius and Scout. A naturally occurring single nucleotide substitution was identified in the gene encoding a major Na + transporter TaHKT1;5-D in Mocho de Espiga Branca, which resulted in a L190P amino acid residue variation. This variant prevents Mocho de Espiga Branca from retrieving Na + from the root xylem leading to a high shoot Na + concentration. The identification of the tissue-tolerant Mocho de Espiga Branca will accelerate the development of more elite salt-tolerant bread wheat cultivars."

Under drought stress conditions, the transgenic Arabidopsis plants had a lower germination rate, relative water content, and proline contents, with higher water loss, chlorophyll loss, relative electrical conductivity, and malondialdehyde contents compared with the wild type. The antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) activity levels were lower in the transgenic plants. The TaDIS1-overexpressing plants had shorter roots with greater growth inhibition in response to mannitol treatment than the wild type, with increased hypersensitivity to ABA during seed germination and early seedling growth. The expression of stress-related genes in transgenic plants under drought stress suggests that TaDIS1 may function negatively in drought stress by regulating the stress response-related genes."

"30181927","abstracttext","Rice blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae is the most destructive disease affecting the rice production ( Oryza sativa ), with an average global loss of 10-30% per annum. Recent reports have indicated that the fungus also inflicts blast disease on wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) posing a serious threat to the wheat production. Due to its easily detected infectious process and manoeuvrable genetic manipulation, M. oryzae is considered a model organism for exploring the molecular mechanism underlying fungal pathogenicity during the pathogen-host interaction. M. oryzae utilises an infectious structure called appressorium to breach the host surface by generating high turgor pressure. The appressorium development is induced by physical and chemical cues which are coordinated by the highly conserved cAMP/PKA, MAPK and calcium signalling cascades. Genes involved in the appressorium development have been identified and well studied in M. oryzae , a summary of the working gene network linking stimuli sensing and physiological transformation of appressorium is needed. This review provides a comprehensive discussion regarding the regulatory networks underlying appressorium development with particular emphasis on sensing of appressorium inducing stimuli, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation and the corresponding developmental and physiological responses. We also discussed the crosstalk and interaction of various pathways during the appressorium development."

"30184068","abstracttext","We report a fungal pan-genome study involving Parastagonospora spp., including 21 isolates of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum, 10 of the grass-infecting Parastagonospora avenae, and 2 of a closely related undefined sister species. We observed substantial variation in the distribution of polymorphisms across the pan-genome, including repeat-induced point mutations, diversifying selection and gene gains and losses. We also discovered chromosome-scale inter and intraspecific presence/absence variation of some sequences, suggesting the occurrence of one or more accessory chromosomes or regions that may play a role in host-pathogen interactions. The presence of known pathogenicity effector loci SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 varied substantially among isolates. Three P. nodorum isolates lacked functional versions for all three loci, whereas three P. avenae isolates carried one or both of the SnTox1 and SnTox3 genes, indicating previously unrecognized potential for discovering additional effectors in the P. nodorum-wheat pathosystem. We utilized the pan-genomic comparative analysis to improve the prediction of pathogenicity effector candidates, recovering the three confirmed effectors among our top-ranked candidates. We propose applying this pan-genomic approach to identify the effector repertoire involved in other host-microbe interactions involving necrotrophic pathogens in the Pezizomycotina."

"30754399","abstracttext","Identification of resistance genes is important for developing leaf rust resistant wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars. A total of 102 Chinese winter wheat cultivars and advanced lines were inoculated with 24 pathotypes of Puccinia triticina for postulation of leaf rust resistance genes effective at the seedling stage. These genotypes were also planted in the field for characterization of slow rusting responses to leaf rust in the 2006-07 and 2007-08 cropping seasons. Fourteen leaf rust resistance genes-Lr1, Lr2a, Lr3bg, Lr3ka, Lr14a, Lr16, Lr17a, Lr18, Lr20, Lr23, Lr24, Lr26, Lr34, and LrZH84-either singly or in combinations, were postulated in 65 genotypes, whereas known resistance genes were not identified in the other 37 accessions. Resistance gene Lr26 was present in 44 accessions. Genes Lr14a and Lr34 were each detected in seven entries. Lr1 and Lr3ka were each found in six cultivars, and five lines possessed Lr16. Lr17a and Lr18 were each identified in four lines. Three cultivars were postulated to possess Lr3bg. Genes Lr20, Lr24, and LrZH84 were each present in two cultivars. Each of the genes Lr2a and Lr23 may exist in one line. Fourteen genotypes showed slow leaf rusting resistance in two cropping seasons."

"30944981","abstracttext_main conclusion","In wheat, a QTL QTrl.saw-2D.2 associated with the total root length was identified, presumably containing genes closely related to root development. A mapping population of 184 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross SY95-71 × CH7034 was used to map QTL for seedling root characteristics in hydroponic culture (HC) and in soil-filled pot (SP) methods. Four traits, including maximum root length (MRL), root number (RN), total length (TRL), and root diameter (RD) were measured and used in QTL analyses. A total of 33 QTL for the four root traits were detected, 17 QTLs for TRL, six for RN, seven for MRL, and three for RD. Seven QTL were detected in both HC and SP methods, which explained 7-18% phenotypic variation. One QTL QTrl.saw-2D.2 detected in both HC and SP methods was also validated in another population comprised of 215 diverse lines. This QTL is a novel QTL that explained the highest phenotypic variation 18% in all QTL identified in the present study. Based on candidate gene and comparative genomics analyses, the QTL QTrl.saw-2D.2 may contain genes closely related to root development in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The two candidate genes were proposed to explore in future studies."

Löve] is an important rangeland Triticeae grass used for forage, conservation, and restoration. This diploid has the basic St genome that occurs also in many polyploid Triticeae species, which serve as a gene reservoir for wheat improvement. Until now, the St genome in diploid species of Pseudoroegneria has not been mapped. Using a double-cross mapping populations, we mapped 230 expressed sequence tag derived simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR) and 3468 genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) markers to 14 linkage groups (LGs), two each for the seven homologous groups of the St genome. The 227 GBS markers of BBWG that matched those in a previous study helped identify the unclassified seven LGs of the St sub-genome among 21 LGs of Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey. Comparisons of GBS sequences in BBWG to whole-genome sequences in bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) revealed that the St genome shared a homology of 35% and 24%, a synteny of 86% and 84%, and a collinearity of 0.85 and 0.86, with ABD and H , respectively. This first-draft molecular map of the St genome will be useful in breeding cereal and forage crops."

"30696904","abstracttext","Soil microelement deficiency and heavy metal contamination affects plant growth and development, but improving trace element uptake and reducing heavy metal accumulation by genetic breeding can help alleviate this. Cell number regulator 2 (TaCNR2) from common wheat (Triticum aestivum) are similar to plant cadmium resistance proteins, involved with regulating heavy metal translocation. Our aim was to understand the effect of TaCNR2 on heavy metal tolerance and translocation. In this study, real-time quantitative PCR indicated TaCNR2 expression in the wheat seedlings increased under Cd, Zn and Mn treatment. Overexpression of TaCNR2 in Arabidopsis and rice enhanced its stress tolerance to Cd, Zn and Mn, and overexpression in rice improved Cd, Zn and Mn translocation from roots to shoots. The grain husks in overexpressed rice had higher Cd, Zn and Mn concentrations, but the brown rice accumulated less Cd but higher Mn than wild rice. The results showed that TaCNR2 can transport heavy metal ions. Thus, this study provides a novel gene resource for increasing nutrition uptake and reducing toxic metal accumulation in crops."

"31835796","abstracttext","Male sterility is a valuable trait for genetic research and production application of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). NWMS1 , a novel typical genic male sterility mutant, was obtained from Shengnong 1, mutagenized with ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). Microstructure and ultrastructure observations of the anthers and microspores indicated that the pollen abortion of NWMS1 started at the early uninucleate microspore stage. Pollen grain collapse, plasmolysis, and absent starch grains were the three typical characteristics of the abnormal microspores. The anther transcriptomes of NWMS1 and its wild type Shengnong 1 were compared at the early anther development stage, pollen mother cell meiotic stage, and binucleate microspore stage. Several biological pathways clearly involved in abnormal anther development were identified, including protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, starch and sucrose metabolism, lipid metabolism, and plant hormone signal transduction. There were 20 key genes involved in the abnormal anther development, screened out by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), including SKP1B , BIP5 , KCS11 , ADH3 , BGLU6, and TIFY10B . The results indicated that the defect in starch and sucrose metabolism was the most important factor causing male sterility in NWMS1 . Based on the experimental data, a primary molecular regulation model of abnormal anther and pollen developments in mutant NWMS1 was established. These results laid a solid foundation for further research on the molecular mechanism of wheat male sterility."

"31782598","abstracttext","Resistance breeding is crucial for a sustainable control of leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) while directly targeting functional variants is the Holy Grail for efficient marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. We assessed the limits and prospects of exome association analysis for severity of leaf rust in a large hybrid wheat population of 1574 single-crosses plus their 133 parents. After imputation and quality control, exome sequencing revealed 202 875 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) covering 19.7% of the high-confidence annotated gene space. We performed intensive data mining and found significant associations for 2171 SNPs corresponding to 50 different loci. Some of these associations mapped in the proximity of the already known resistance genes Lr21, Lr34-B, Lr1 and Lr10, while other associated genomic regions, such as those on chromosomes 1A and 3D, harboured several annotated genes putatively involved in resistance. Validation with an independent population helped to narrow down the list of putative resistance genes that should be targeted by fine-mapping. We expect that the proposed strategy of intensive data mining coupled with validation will significantly influence research in plant genetics and breeding."

Along with its local production, long-distance transport coordinated by the efflux/influx membrane transporters is instrumental in plant development and architecture. In the present study, we cloned and characterized a wheat (Triticum aestivum) auxin efflux carrier ABCB1. The TaABCB1 was physically localized to the proximal 15% of the short arm of wheat homoeologous group 7 chromosomes. Size of the Chinese spring (CS) homoeologs genomic copies ranged from 5.3-6.2 kb with the 7A copy being the largest due to novel insertions in its third intron. The three homoeologous copies share 95-97% sequence similarity at the nucleotide, 98-99% amino acid, and overall Q-score of 0.98 at 3-D structure level. Though detected in all analyzed tissues, TaABCB1 predominantly expressed in the meristematic tissues likely due to the presence of meristem-specific activation regulatory element identified in the promoter region. RNAi plants of TaABCB1 gene resulted in reduced plant height and increased seed width. Promoter analysis revealed several responsive elements detected in the promoter region including that for different hormones as auxin, gibberellic acid, jasmonic acid and abscisic acid, light, and circadian regulated elements."

While the phytotoxicity of trichothecenes, such as deoxynivalenol (DON), and their role in virulence are well characterized, less is known about the phytotoxicity of CUL and its role in the development of FHB. Herein, we evaluated the phytotoxic effects of purified CUL and CUL-trichothecene mixtures using Chlamydomonas reinhardtii growth and Triticum aestivum (wheat) root elongation assays. By itself, CUL did not affect growth in either system. However, mixtures of CUL with DON, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol, 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, or NX-3, but not with nivalenol, inhibited growth in a synergistic manner. Synergistic phytotoxic effects of CUL and DON were also observed on multiple plant varieties and species. The severity of wheat FHB caused by 15 isolates of Fusarium graminearum was negatively correlated with the CUL/DON ratio, but positively correlated with the sum of both CUL and DON. Additionally, during the first week of infection, CUL biosynthetic genes were more highly expressed than the TRI5 trichothecene biosynthetic gene. Furthermore, genomic analysis of Fusarium species revealed that CUL and trichothecene biosynthetic genes consistently co-occur among species closely related to F. graminearum ."
"32909250","articletitle","Stepwise increases in FT1 expression regulate seasonal progression of flowering in wheat (Triticum aestivum)."
"32909250","abstracttext","Flowering is regulated by genes that respond to changing daylengths and temperature, which have been well studied using controlled conditions; however, the molecular processes underpinning flowering in nature remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the genetic pathways that coordinate flowering and inflorescence development of wheat (Triticum aestivum) as daylengths extend naturally in the field, using lines that contain variant alleles for the key photoperiod gene, Photoperiod-1 (Ppd-1). We found flowering involves a stepwise increase in the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1), which initiates under day-neutral conditions of early spring. The incremental rise in FT1 expression is overridden in plants that contain a photoperiod-insensitive allele of Ppd-1, which hastens the completion of spikelet development and accelerates flowering time. The accelerated inflorescence development of photoperiod-insensitive lines is promoted by advanced seasonal expression of floral meristem identity genes. The completion of spikelet formation is promoted by FLOWERING LOCUS T2, which regulates spikelet number and is activated by Ppd-1. In wheat, flowering under natural photoperiods is regulated by stepwise increases in the expression of FT1, which responds dynamically to extending daylengths to promote early inflorescence development. This research provides a strong foundation to improve yield potential by fine-tuning the photoperiod-dependent control of inflorescence development."

"33057145","abstracttext","SQUAMOSA promoter-binding protein (SBP)-box genes encode a family of plant-specific transcription factors that play roles in plant growth and development. The characteristics of SBP-box genes in rice (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis have been reported, but their potential roles in wheat (Triticum aestivum) are not fully understood. In this study, 48 SBP-box genes (TaSBPs) were identified; they were located in all wheat chromosomes except for 4B and 4D. Six TaSBPs were identified as tandem duplication genes that formed three tandem duplication pairs, while 22 were segmentally duplicated genes that formed 16 segmental duplication pairs. Subcellular localization prediction showed TaSBPs were located in nucleus. Among the 48 TaSBPs, 24 were predicted to be putative targets of TamiR156. Phylogenetic analysis showed that TaSBPs, AtSBPs, and OsSBPs that shared similar functions were clustered into the same subgroups. The phylogenetic relationships between the TaSBPs were supported by the identification of highly conserved motifs and gene structures. Four types of cis-elements--transcription-related, development-related, hormone-related, and abiotic stress-related elements--were found in the TaSBP promoters. Expression profiles indicated most TaSBPs participate in flower development and abiotic stress responses. This study establishes a foundation for further investigation of TaSBP genes and provides novel insights into their biological functions."

"26815857","abstracttext","The Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia, an invasive phytotoxic pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum, and barley, Hordeum vulgare, causes huge economic losses in Africa, South America, and North America. Most acceptable and ecologically beneficial aphid management strategies include selection and breeding of D. noxia-resistant varieties, and numerous D. noxia resistance genes have been identified in T. aestivum and H. vulgare. North American D. noxia biotype 1 is avirulent to T. aestivum varieties possessing Dn4 or Dn7 genes, while biotype 2 is virulent to Dn4 and avirulent to Dn7. The current investigation utilized next-generation RNAseq technology to reveal that biotype 2 over expresses proteins involved in calcium signaling, which activates phosphoinositide (PI) metabolism. Calcium signaling proteins comprised 36% of all transcripts identified in the two D. noxia biotypes. Depending on plant resistance gene-aphid biotype interaction, additional transcript groups included those involved in tissue growth; defense and stress response; zinc ion and related cofactor binding; and apoptosis. Activation of enzymes involved in PI metabolism by D. noxia biotype 2 aphids allows depletion of plant calcium that normally blocks aphid feeding sites in phloem sieve elements and enables successful, continuous feeding on plants resistant to avirulent biotype 1. Inhibition of the key enzyme phospholipase C significantly reduced biotype 2 salivation into phloem and phloem sap ingestion."

"32854622","abstracttext_background","Wheat blast, caused by Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum (MoT) pathotype, is a global threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. Few blast resistance (R) genes have been identified to date, therefore assessing potential sources of resistance in wheat is important. The Brazilian wheat cultivar BR 18-Terena is considered one of the best sources of resistance to blast and has been widely used in Brazilian breeding programmes, however the underlying genetics of this resistance are unknown."
"32854622","abstracttext_results","BR 18-Terena was used as the common parent in the development of two recombinant inbred line (RIL) F 6 populations with the Brazilian cultivars Anahuac 75 and BRS 179. Populations were phenotyped for resistance at the seedling and heading stage using the sequenced MoT isolate BR32, with transgressive segregation being observed. Genetic maps containing 1779 and 1318 markers, were produced for the Anahuac 75 × BR 18-Terena and BR 18-Terena × BRS 179 populations, respectively. Five quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with seedling resistance, on chromosomes 2B, 4B (2 QTL), 5A and 6A, were identified, as were four QTL associated with heading stage resistance (1A, 2B, 4A and 5A). Seedling and heading stage QTL did not co-locate, despite a significant positive correlation between these traits, indicating that resistance at these developmental stages is likely to be controlled by different genes. BR 18-Terena provided the resistant allele for six QTL, at both developmental stages, with the largest phenotypic effect conferred by a QTL being 24.8% suggesting that BR 18-Terena possesses quantitative resistance. Haplotype analysis of 100 Brazilian wheat cultivars indicates that 11.0% of cultivars already possess a BR 18-Terena-like haplotype for more than one of the identified heading stage QTL."
"32854622","abstracttext_conclusions","This study suggests that BR 18-Terena possesses quantitative resistance to wheat blast, with nine QTL associated with resistance at either the seedling or heading stage being detected. Wheat blast resistance is also largely tissue-specific. Identification of durable quantitative resistances which can be combined with race-specific R gene-mediated resistance is critical to effectively control wheat blast. Collectively, this work facilitates marker-assisted selection to develop new varieties for cultivation in regions at risk from this emerging disease."

"19484121","abstracttext","A marker-assisted background selection (MABS)-based gene introgression approach in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was optimized, where 97% or more of a recurrent parent genome (RPG) can be recovered in just two backcross (BC) generations. A four-step MABS method was developed based on 'Plabsim' computer simulations and wheat genome structure information. During empirical optimization of this method, double recombinants around the target gene were selected in a step-wise fashion during the two BC cycles followed by selection for recurrent parent genotype on non-carrier chromosomes. The average spacing between carrier chromosome markers was <4 cM. For non-carrier chromosome markers that flanked each of the 48 wheat gene-rich regions, this distance was approximately 12 cM. Employed to introgress seedling stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) resistance gene Yr15 into the spring wheat cultivar 'Zak', marker analysis of 2,187 backcross-derived progeny resulted in the recovery of a BC(2)F(2ratio3) plant with 97% of the recurrent parent genome. In contrast, only 82% of the recurrent parent genome was recovered in phenotypically selected BC(4)F(7) plants developed without MABS. Field evaluation results from 17 locations indicated that the MABS-derived line was either equal or superior to the recurrent parent for the tested agronomic characteristics. Based on these results, MABS is recommended as a strategy for rapidly introgressing a targeted gene into a wheat genotype in just two backcross generations while recovering 97% or more of the recurrent parent genotype."

Many wheat flour proteins also present dietary problems for consumers with celiac disease or wheat allergies. Despite the importance of these proteins it has been particularly challenging to use MS/MS to distinguish the many proteins in a flour sample and relate them to gene sequences."

The spectra were used to interrogate an improved protein sequence database and results were integrated using the Scaffold program. Inclusion of cultivar specific sequences in the database greatly improved the results, and 233 spots were identified, accounting for 93.1% of normalized spot volume. Identified proteins were assigned to 157 wheat sequences, many for proteins unique to wheat and nearly 40% from Butte 86.

Many genes for wheat flour proteins are not expressed, so this study represents further progress in describing the expressed wheat genome. Use of cultivar-specific contigs helped to overcome the difficulties of matching peptides to gene sequences for members of highly similar, rapidly evolving storage protein families. Prospects for simplifying this process for routine analyses are discussed. The ability to measure expression levels for individual flour protein genes complements information gained from efforts to sequence the wheat genome and is essential for studies of effects of environment on gene expression."

"2545522","abstracttext","We have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequence of a gene encoding alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) from Triticum aestivum cv. Millewa. Southern analysis using cv. Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines established that the cloned gene mapped to the long arm of chromosome 1A and does not correspond to any previously identified wheat Adh locus. Southern analysis also provided evidence for triplicate copies of this Adh gene on the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes, while Northern blots indicated that the homoeologous group 1 Adh genes, like several other plant Adh genes, are transcribed under anaerobic conditions. Sequence analysis indicates that the cloned gene has a structure similar to both monocot and dicot Adh genes with an open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 379 amino acids. Sequences important for eucaryotic gene expression such as the TATA box, polyadenylation signal, and intron splice sites were found in the expected positions. The open reading frame is interrupted by 8 introns which are in identical positions with 8 of the 9 introns in maize and pea Adh genes, suggesting that during evolution there are processes occurring that result in the loss of introns. Sequence analysis also revealed that the cloned wheat Adh gene shared extensive homology with the barley Adh3 gene not only in the coding region but also in the noncoding regions. However, this homology is discontinuous as a result of a 1.8-kbp insertion (TLM), which is present in the cloned wheat Adh gene and absent in the barley Adh3 gene. Sequence analysis of this insertion reveals features characteristic of the short terminal inverted repeat class of eucaryotic transposable elements. We have no evidence for the transposition of the TLM element. However, Southern blots reveal multiple copies of sequences related to TLM in the wheat genome and in other closely related species, suggesting that transposition may once have played an important role in the evolution of the Gramineae family."

The NILs were grown with replications and the effect of marker genes on plant morphology in the genetic background of CS was investigated. These NILs were further crossed with the corresponding monosomics of CS and 13 monosomic lines whose monosome carries a respective marker gene were established and named ""marked monosomics."" Many of the marked monosomics were distinguishable from the disomic NILs because of the different dosage effect of the genes. The NILs are utilized for studies on gene isolation or gene regulation. Marked monosomics are useful not only for monosomic analysis but also for production of homologous chromosome substitution lines because chromosome observation is not required."

"10712528","abstracttext","To examine the biological role of Al-stress-induced genes, nine genes derived from Arabidopsis, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) were expressed in Arabidopsis ecotype Landsberg. Lines containing eight of these genes were phenotypically normal and were tested in root elongation assays for their sensitivity to Al, Cd, Cu, Na, Zn, and to oxidative stresses. An Arabidopsis blue-copper-binding protein gene (AtBCB), a tobacco glutathione S-transferase gene (parB), a tobacco peroxidase gene (NtPox), and a tobacco GDP-dissociation inhibitor gene (NtGDI1) conferred a degree of resistance to Al. Two of these genes, AtBCB and parB, and a peroxidase gene from Arabidopsis (AtPox) also showed increased resistance to oxidative stress induced by diamide, while parB conferred resistance to Cu and Na. Al content of Al-treated root tips was reduced in the four Al-resistant plant lines compared with wild-type Ler-0, as judged by morin staining. All four Al-resistant lines also showed reduced staining of roots with 2',7'-dichloro fluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFDA), an indicator of oxidative stress. We conclude that Al-induced genes can serve to protect against Al toxicity, and also provide genetic evidence for a link between Al stress and oxidative stress in plants."

The Aux/IAA genes are best characterized among the early auxin-responsive genes, which encode short-lived transcriptional repressors. In most plants examined, including Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice, the Aux/IAA genes constitute a large gene family. By screening the available databases, at least 15 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) have been identified from wheat (Triticum aestivum), which exhibit high sequence identity with Aux/IAA homologues in other species. One of these Aux/IAA genes, TaIAA1, harbouring all the four conserved domains characteristic of the Aux/IAA proteins, has been characterized in detail. The expression of TaIAA1 is light-sensitive, tissue-specific, and is induced within 15-30 min of exogenous auxin application. Also, the TaIAA1 transcript levels increase in the presence of a divalent cation, Ca(2+), and this effect is reversed by the calcium-chelating agent, EGTA. The TaIAA1 gene qualifies as the primary response gene because an increase in its transcript levels by auxin is unaffected by cycloheximide. In addition to auxin, the TaIAA1 gene is also induced by brassinosteroid, providing evidence that interplay between hormones is crucial for the regulation of plant growth and development."

"19214392","abstracttext","Powdery mildew resistance from Thinopyrum intermedium was introgressed into common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Genetic analysis of the F(1), F(2), F(3) and BC(1) populations from powdery mildew resistant line CH5025 revealed that resistance was controlled by a single dominant allele. The gene responsible for powdery mildew resistance was mapped by the linkage analysis of a segregating F(2) population. The resistance gene was linked to five co-dominant genomic SSR markers (Xcfd233, Xwmc41, Xbarc11, Xgwm539 and Xwmc175) and their most likely order was Xcfd233-Xwmc41-Pm43-Xbarc11-Xgwm539-Xwmc175 at 2.6, 2.3, 4.2, 3.5 and 7.0 cM, respectively. Using the Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines, the polymorphic markers and the resistance gene were assigned to chromosome 2DL. As no powdery mildew resistance gene was previously assigned to chromosome 2DL, this new resistance gene was designated Pm43. Pm43, together with the identified closely linked markers, could be useful in marker-assisted selection for pyramiding powdery mildew resistance genes."

"25893709","abstracttext","Analysis of gene expression data generated by high-throughput microarray transcript profiling experiments coupled with cis-regulatory elements enrichment study and cluster analysis can be used to define modular gene programs and regulatory networks. Unfortunately, the high molecular weight glutenin subunits of wheat (Triticum aestivum) are more similar than microarray data alone would allow to distinguish between the three homoeologous gene pairs. However, combining complementary DNA (cDNA) expression libraries with microarray data, a co-expressional network was built that highlighted the hidden differences between these highly similar genes. Duplex clusters of cis-regulatory elements were used to focus the co-expressional network of transcription factors to the putative regulatory network of Glu-1 genes. The focused network helped to identify several transcriptional gene programs in the endosperm. Many of these programs demonstrated a conserved temporal pattern across the studied genotypes; however, few others showed variance. Based on this network, transient gene expression assays were performed with mutated promoters to inspect the control of tissue specificity. Results indicated that the interactions of the ABRE│CBF cluster with distal promoter regions may have a dual role in regulation by both recruiting the transcription complex as well as suppressing it in non-endosperm tissue. A putative model of regulation is discussed."

"27327613","abstracttext","The utility of genome assemblies does not only rely on the quality of the assembled genome sequence, but also on the quality of the gene annotations. The Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq technology is a powerful support for accurate eukaryotic gene model annotation as it allows for direct readout of full-length cDNA sequences without the need for noisy short read-based transcript assembly. We propose the implementation of the TeloPrime Full Length cDNA Amplification kit to the Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq technology in order to enrich for genuine full-length transcripts in the cDNA libraries. We provide evidence that TeloPrime outperforms the commonly used SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit in identifying transcription start and end sites in Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we show that TeloPrime-based Pacific Biosciences Iso-Seq can be successfully applied to the polyploid genome of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) not only to efficiently annotate gene models, but also to identify novel transcription sites, gene homeologs, splicing isoforms and previously unidentified gene loci."

"18074114","abstracttext","The Lr34/Yr18 locus has contributed to durable, non-race specific resistance against leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Lr34/Yr18 also cosegregates with resistance to powdery mildew (Pm38) and a leaf tip necrosis phenotype (Ltn1). Using a high resolution mapping family from a cross between near-isogenic lines in the ""Thatcher"" background we demonstrated that Lr34/Yr18 also cosegregated with stem rust resistance in the field. Lr34/Yr18 probably interacts with unlinked genes to provide enhanced stem rust resistance in ""Thatcher"". In view of the relatively low levels of DNA polymorphism reported in the Lr34/Yr18 region, gamma irradiation of the single chromosome substitution line, Lalbahadur(Parula7D) that carries Lr34/Yr18 was used to generate several mutant lines. Characterisation of the mutants revealed a range of highly informative genotypes, which included variable size deletions and an overlapping set of interstitial deletions. The mutants enabled a large number of wheat EST derived markers to be mapped and define a relatively small physical region on chromosome 7DS that carried Lr34/Yr18. Fine scale genetic mapping confirmed the physical mapping and identified a genetic interval of less than 0.5 cM, which contained Lr34/Yr18. Both rice and Brachypodium genome sequences provided useful information for fine mapping of ESTs in wheat. Gene order was more conserved between wheat and Brachypodium than with rice but these smaller grass genomes did not reveal sequence information that could be used to identify a candidate gene for rust resistance in wheat. We predict that Lr34/Yr18 is located within a large insertion in wheat not found at syntenic positions in Brachypodium and rice."

"15197579","abstracttext","Structural and functional relationships between the genomes of hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) (2n=6x=42) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) (2n=2x=24) were evaluated using linkage maps supplemented with simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci obtained from publicly available expressed sequence tags (ESTs). EST-SSR markers were developed using two main strategies to design primers for each gene: (1) primer design for multiple species based on supercluster analysis, and (2) species-specific primer design. Amplification was more consistent using the species-specific primer design for each gene. Forty-four percent of the primers designed specifically for wheat sequences were successful in amplifying DNA from both species. Existing genetic linkage maps were enhanced for the wheat and rice genomes using orthologous loci amplified with 58 EST-SSR markers obtained from both wheat and rice ESTs. The PCR-based anchor loci identified by these EST-SSR markers support previous patterns of conservation between wheat and rice genomes; however, there was a high frequency of interrupted colinearity. In addition, multiple loci amplified by these primers made the comparative analysis more difficult. Enhanced comparative maps of wheat and rice provide a useful tool for interpreting and transferring molecular, genetic, and breeding information between these two important species. These EST-SSR markers are particularly useful for constructing comparative framework maps for different species, because they amplify closely related genes to provide anchor points across species."

"18943790","abstracttext","ABSTRACT A major leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL) (QLrP.sfr-7DS) previously has been described on chromosome 7DS in the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cv. Forno. It was detected in a population of single-seed descent (SSD) lines derived from the cross Arina x Forno. QLrP.sfr-7DS conferred a durable and slow-rusting resistance phenotype, co-segregated with a QTL for leaf tip necrosis (LTN) and was mapped close to Xgwm295 at a very similar location as the adult plant leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 found in some spring wheat lines. Here, we describe the validation of this QTL by mapping it to the same chromosomal region close to Xgwm295 on chromosome 7DS in a population of SSD lines from the winter wheat x spelt (T. spelta) cross Forno x Oberkulmer. In both populations, the log of the likelihood ratio curves for leaf rust resistance and LTN peaked at identical or very similar locations, indicating that both traits are due to the same gene. We have improved the genetic map in the target region of QLrP.sfr-7DS using microsatellite and expressed sequence tag (EST) markers. Two EST loci (Xsfr.BF473324 and Xsfr.BE493812) define a genetic interval of 7.6 centimorgans containing QLrP.sfr-7DS, a considerably more precise genetic location for this QTL than previously described both in spring and winter wheat. The identified genetic interval is physically located in the distal 39% of chromosome 7DS. Single-marker analysis identified Xsfr.BF473324 and Xgwm1220 as the most informative loci for QLrP.sfr-7DS and QLtn.sfr-7DS. In the rice genome, the two ESTs flanking the QLrP.sfr-7DS/QLtn.sfr-7DS chromosomal segment in wheat are conserved on chromosome 6S in a region colinear with wheat chromosome 7DS. There, they define a physical region of three rice bacterial artificial chromosomes spanning approximately 300 kb."
"21994169","articletitle","The quantitative response of wheat vernalization to environmental variables indicates that vernalization is not a response to cold temperature."
"21994169","abstracttext","The initiation of flowering is a crucial trait that allows temperate plants to flower in the favourable conditions of spring. The timing of flowering initiation is governed by two main mechanisms: vernalization that defines a plant's requirement for a prolonged exposure to cold temperatures; and photoperiod sensitivity defining the need for long days to initiate floral transition. Genetic variability in both vernalization and photoperiod sensitivity largely explains the adaptability of cultivated crop plants such as bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to a wide range of climatic conditions. The major genes controlling wheat vernalization (VRN1, VRN2, and VRN3) and photoperiod sensitivity (PPD1) have been identified, and knowledge of their interactions at the molecular level is growing. However, the quantitative effects of temperature and photoperiod on these genes remain poorly understood. Here it is shown that the distinction between the temperature effects on organ appearance rate and on vernalization sensu stricto is crucial for understanding the quantitative effects of the environmental signal on wheat flowering. By submitting near isogenic lines of wheat differing in their allelic composition at the VRN1 locus to various temperature and photoperiod treatments, it is shown that, at the whole-plant level, the vernalization process has a positive response to temperature with complex interactions with photoperiod. In addition, the phenotypic variation associated with the presence of different spring homoeoalleles of VRN1 is not induced by a residual vernalization requirement. The results demonstrate that a precise definition of vernalization is necessary to understand and model temperature and photoperiod effects on wheat flowering. It is suggested that this definition should be used as the basis for gene expression studies and assessment of functioning of the wheat flowering gene network, including an explicit account of the quantitative effect of environmental variables."

Coefficient-of-parentage (COP) values of 248 North American hard spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) cultivars released from 1901 to 1991 were used to estimate the genetic similarity of cultivars. COP values were used: to (1) quantify germ plasm sources and their contributions to the North American hard spring wheat gene pool; (2) measure changes in genetic diversity through time; and (3) identify major groupings of related cultivars. Landraces and local cultivars that contributed to the formation of the gene pool were: spring wheat (64%), winter wheat (16%), T. turgidum var. durum L. (10%), and T. turgidum var. emmer L. (8%). 'Fife', 'Hard Red Calcutta', and 'Turkey Red' accounted for 18%, 13%, and 8%, respectively, of the hard spring wheat origins. 'Era' and 'Butte' in the US, and 'Neepawa' and 'HY 320' in Canada, were the most commonly used named parents of cultivars released from 1981 to 1991. Both Canada and US had the greatest level of similarity among new cultivar releases in the 1930s (Canada: r=0.39, US: r=0.34). Genetic similarity in the US declined to r=0.14 in the 1940s and remained relatively constant thereafter. Similarity among released Canadian cultivars remained relatively high until the 1970s when the introduction of new market classes resulted in a 50% reduction in genetic similarity to approximately the same level of similarity found in the US. Cluster analysis was used to group cultivars released after 1941 into 13 clusters of similar genotypes. The cultivar clusters may have value for the stratified sampling of spring wheat germ plasm or in identifying diverse germ plasm for intermating."

"26332346","articletitle","The wheat transcription factor TaGAMyb recruits histone acetyltransferase and activates the expression of a high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit gene."
"26332346","abstracttext","Glutenin proteins in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour confer unique viscoelastic properties to dough products and, therefore, the concentration and composition of the glutenin proteins determine its end-use value. However, the mechanisms governing the glutenin gene expression remain elusive. In this study, we report that wheat TaGAMyb activates the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit genes (TaGLU) through recruiting the histone acetyltransferase GCN5. By sequencing the promoters of TaGLU-1 genes from 40 modern wheat cultivars, we identified eight types of TaGAMyb binding motifs and verified these by electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The number of TaGAMyb binding motifs in TaGLU-1 genes is correlated with the abundance of glutenin in different cultivars. Chromatin immunoprecipitation plus polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-PCR) analysis reveals that TaGCN5 directly targets the promoters of TaGLU-1 genes in wheat endosperm. We find that TaGAMyb physically interacts with the wheat histone acetyltransferase TaGCN5 and also interacts with Arabidopsis thaliana AtGCN5. TaGAMyb ectopically expressed in Arabidopsis binds to the TaGLU-1Dy promoter on a TaGLU-1Dy transgene and activates its expression. AtGCN5 also targets the TaGLU-1Dy transgene and is involved in the establishment of acetylation at H3K9 and H3K14. These results demonstrate that TaGAMyb plays a dual role in activating expression of glutenin gene by directly binding to the TaGLU promoter and by recruiting GCN5 to modulate histone acetylation during wheat endosperm development."

Higher expression levels were observed for TaMET1 homoeologous group 2 genes compared to group 5 and 7, indicating that group 2 homoeologous genes are predominant at the transcriptional level, while group 5 evolved into pseudogenes. We show the connection between low expression levels, elevated evolution rates and unexpected enrichment in CG-dinucleotides (CG-rich isochores) at putative promoter regions of homoeologous group 5 and 7, but not of group 2 TaMET1 genes.

"25158883","articletitle","The Na(+) transporter, TaHKT1;5-D, limits shoot Na(+) accumulation in bread wheat."
"25158883","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has a major salt tolerance locus, Kna1, responsible for the maintenance of a high cytosolic K(+) /Na(+) ratio in the leaves of salt stressed plants. The Kna1 locus encompasses a large DNA fragment, the distal 14% of chromosome 4DL. Limited recombination has been observed at this locus making it difficult to map genetically and identify the causal gene. Here, we decipher the function of TaHKT1;5-D, a candidate gene underlying the Kna1 locus. Transport studies using the heterologous expression systems Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Xenopus laevis oocytes indicated that TaHKT1;5-D is a Na(+) -selective transporter. Transient expression in Arabidopsis thaliana mesophyll protoplasts and in situ polymerase chain reaction indicated that TaHKT1;5-D is localised on the plasma membrane in the wheat root stele. RNA interference-induced silencing decreased the expression of TaHKT1;5-D in transgenic bread wheat lines which led to an increase in the Na(+) concentration in the leaves. This indicates that TaHKT1;5-D retrieves Na(+) from the xylem vessels in the root and has an important role in restricting the transport of Na(+) from the root to the leaves in bread wheat. Thus, TaHKT1;5-D confers the essential salinity tolerance mechanism in bread wheat associated with the Kna1 locus via shoot Na(+) exclusion and is critical in maintaining a high K(+) /Na(+) ratio in the leaves. These findings show there is potential to increase the salinity tolerance of bread wheat by manipulation of HKT1;5 genes."

"29163559","abstracttext","Mineral concentrations in cereals are important for human health, especially for people who depend mainly on consuming cereal diet. In this study, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of calcium concentrations in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) grains using a European wheat diversity panel of 353 varieties [339 winter wheat (WW) plus 14 of spring wheat (SW)] and phenotypic data based on two field seasons. High genotyping densities of single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were obtained from the application of the 90k iSELECT ILLUMINA chip and a 35k Affymetrix chip. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) was used to measure the calcium concentrations of the wheat grains. Best linear unbiased estimates (BLUEs) for calcium were calculated across the seasons and ranged from 288.20 to 647.50 among the varieties (μg g -1 DW) with a mean equaling 438.102 (μg g -1 DW), and the heritability was 0.73. A total of 485 SNP marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected in data obtained from grains cultivated in both of the two seasons and BLUE values by considering associations with a -log 10 ( P -value) ≥3.0. Among these SNP markers, we detected 276 markers with a positive allele effect and 209 markers with a negative allele effect. These MTAs were found on all chromosomes except chromosomes 3D, 4B, and 4D. The most significant association was located on chromosome 5A (114.5 cM) and was linked to a gene encoding cation/sugar symporter activity as a potential candidate gene. Additionally, a number of candidate genes for the uptake or transport of calcium were located near significantly associated SNPs. This analysis highlights a number of genomic regions and candidate genes for further analysis as well as the challenges faced when mapping environmentally variable traits in genetically highly diverse variety panels. The research demonstrates the feasibility of the GWAS approach for illuminating the genetic architecture of calcium-concentration in wheat grains and for identifying putative candidate genes underlying this trait."

"28624908","abstracttext_key message","Greenbug and Hessian fly are important pests that decrease wheat production worldwide. We developed and validated breeder-friendly KASP markers for marker-assisted breeding to increase selection efficiency. Greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) and Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] are two major destructive insect pests of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) throughout wheat production regions in the USA and worldwide. Greenbug and Hessian fly infestation can significantly reduce grain yield and quality. Breeding for resistance to these two pests using marker-assisted selection (MAS) is the most economical strategy to minimize losses. In this study, doubled haploid lines from the Synthetic W7984 × Opata M85 wheat reference population were used to construct linkage maps for the greenbug resistance gene Gb7 and the Hessian fly resistance gene H32 with genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and 90K array-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker data. Flanking markers were closely linked to Gb7 and H32 and were located on chromosome 7DL and 3DL, respectively. Gb7-linked markers (synopGBS773 and synopGBS1141) and H32-linked markers (synopGBS901 and IWB65911) were converted into Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays for MAS in wheat breeding. In addition, comparative mapping identified syntenic regions in Brachypodium distachyon, rice (Oryza sativa), and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) for Gb7 and H32 that can be used for fine mapping and map-based cloning of the genes. The KASP markers developed in this study are the first set of SNPs tightly linked to Gb7 and H32 and will be very useful for MAS in wheat breeding programs and future genetic studies of greenbug and Hessian fly resistance."

"29526810","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a staple food for a significant part of the world's population. The growing demand on its production can be satisfied by improving yield and resistance to biotic and abiotic stress. Knowledge of the genome sequence would aid in discovering genes and QTLs underlying these traits and provide a basis for genomics-assisted breeding. Physical maps and BAC clones associated with them have been valuable resources from which to generate a reference genome of bread wheat and to assist map-based gene cloning. As a part of a joint effort coordinated by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium, we have constructed a BAC-based physical map of bread wheat chromosome arm 7DS consisting of 895 contigs and covering 94% of its estimated length. By anchoring BAC contigs to one radiation hybrid map and three high resolution genetic maps, we assigned 73% of the assembly to a distinct genomic position. This map integration, interconnecting a total of 1713 markers with ordered and sequenced BAC clones from a minimal tiling path, provides a tool to speed up gene cloning in wheat. The process of physical map assembly included the integration of the 7DS physical map with a whole-genome physical map of Aegilops tauschii and a 7DS Bionano genome map, which together enabled efficient scaffolding of physical-map contigs, even in the non-recombining region of the genetic centromere. Moreover, this approach facilitated a comparison of bread wheat and its ancestor at BAC-contig level and revealed a reconstructed region in the 7DS pericentromere."

CL-1 and biochar + CL-1 increased putrescine contents by 93% and 150% and bacterial aguA gene copy numbers by 30% and 44%, respectively, in the rhizosphere soils compared to the controls based on qPCR analysis. Furthermore, biochar + CL-1 reduced the Cd and Pb bioconcentration and translocation factors by 23-33% compared to the controls. CL-1 significantly increased the pH and reduced water-soluble Cd and Pb concentrations (18-44%) in the metal-contaminated soil solution compared to the controls. The results showed a synergistic effect of biochar and CL-1 on the reduction of Cd and Pb accumulation in wheat grains. These findings suggested that biochar plus CL-1 reduced wheat grain metal uptake by reducing metal availability and translocation from the roots to grains and increasing pH levels, putrescine production, and aguA gene abundance, and they highlight the possibility of developing an effective technique for reducing the metal uptake of wheat grains using biochar plus metal-immobilizing bacteria in metal-contaminated soils."

"32479613","abstracttext","Salt and drought-induced RING finger1 (SDIR1) is a RING-type E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a key role in ABA-mediated responses to salinity and drought stress via the ubiquitination pathway in some plant species. However, its function in wheat (Triticum aestivum) is unknown. Here, we isolated a SDIR1 member in wheat, TaSDIR1-4A, and characterized its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. DNA polymorphism assays showed the presence of two nucleotide variation sites in the promoter region of TaSDIR1-4A, leading to the detection of the haplotypes Hap-4A-1 and Hap-4A-2 in wheat populations. Association analysis showed that TaSDIR1-4A haplotypes were associated with 1000-grain weight (TGW) across a variety of different environments, including well-watered and heat-stress conditions. Genotypes with Hap-4A-2 had higher TGW than those with Hap-4A-1. Phenotypes in both gene-silenced wheat and transgenic Arabidopsis showed that TaSDIR1-4A was a negative regulator of grain size. Gene expression assays indicated that TaSDIR1-4A was most highly expressed in flag leaves, and expression was higher in Hap-4A-1 accessions than in Hap-4A-2 accessions. The difference might be attributable to the fact that TaERF3 (ethylene response factor) can act as a transcriptional repressor of TaSDIR1-4A in Hap-4A-2 but not in Hap-4A-1. Examination of modern wheat varieties shows that the favorable haplotype has been positively selected in breeding programs in China. The functional marker for TaSDIR1-4A developed in this study should be helpful for future wheat breeding."

"31671113","abstracttext","Common wheat (Triticum aestivum) is the most widely grown cereal crop and is cultivated extensively in dry regions. Water shortage, resulting from either drought or salinity, leads to slow growth and loss of wheat yield. In order to predict new genes responsive to the drought and salt stresses in wheat, 6,717 expressed sequence tags (ESTs), expressed in drought and salinity stress conditions were collected from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). The downloaded ESTs were clustered and assembled into 354 contigs; 14 transcription factor families in 29 contigs were identified. In addition, 119 contigs were organized in five enzyme classes. Biological functions were obtained for only 324 of the 354 contigs using gene ontology. In addition, using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, 191 metabolic pathways were identified. The remaining contigs were used for further analysis and the search for new genes responsive to drought and salt stresses. These contigs were mapped on the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium RefSeq v1.0 assembly, the most complete version of the reference sequence of the bread wheat variety Chinese Spring. They were found to have from one to three locations on the subgenomes A, B, and D. Full-length gene sequences were designed for these contigs, which were further validated using promoter analysis. These predicted genes may have applications in molecular breeding programs and wheat drought and salinity research."

"33030628","abstracttext_main conclusion","Early cytokinin activity and late abscisic acid dynamics during wheat kernel development correspond to cultivars with higher yield potential. Cytokinins represent prime targets for marker development for wheat breeding programs. Two major phytohormone groups, abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinins (CKs), are of crucial importance for seed development. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield is, to a high degree, determined during the milk and dough stages of kernel development. Therefore, understanding the hormonal regulation of these early growth stages is fundamental for crop-improvement programs of this important cereal. Here, we profiled ABA and 25 CK metabolites (including active forms, precursors and inactive conjugates) during kernel development in five field-grown wheat cultivars. The levels of ABA and profiles of CK forms varied greatly among the tested cultivars and kernel stages suggesting that several types of CK metabolites are involved in spatiotemporal regulation of kernel development. The seed yield potential was associated with the elevated levels of active CK levels (tZ, cZ). Interestingly, the increased kernel cZ levels were followed by higher ABA production, suggesting there is an interaction between these two phytohormones. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression patterns of representatives of the four main CK metabolic gene families. The unique transcriptional patterns of the IPT (biosynthesis) and ZOG (reversible inactivation) gene family members (GFMs) in the high and low yield cultivars additionally indicate that there is a significant association between CK metabolism and yield potential in wheat. Based on these results, we suggest that both CK metabolites and their associated genes, can serve as important, early markers of yield performance in modern wheat breeding programs."

The effectiveness of the constructs was first compared in cell suspension cultures by counting blue expression units (b.e.u.). The expression of construct pAHC25 ranged from 3 to 50 fold greater than pBARGUS in different species. In addition, the two plasmids were quantitatively compared in Triticum aestivum and Zea mays by using the more sensitive GUS fluorometric assay to determine the amount of methylumbellyferride (MU) produced. There was more than a 30 fold increase in MU production with pAHC25 than with pBARGUS in the wheat suspension, while the maize suspension showed only a 2.5 fold increase with the pAHC25 construct. Transient GUS expression was also visualized in immature embryos of Pennisetum glaucum following bombardment with pBARGUS and pAHC25 DNA. Expression of plasmid pAHC25 was twice as high as pBARGUS. A comparison of two DNA/gold preparation methods, as well as repeated sonications of the DNA/gold mixture, had no effect on the number of b.e.u."

"27208148","articletitle","Inheritance and Molecular Mapping of an All-Stage Stripe Rust Resistance Gene Derived from the Chinese Common Wheat Landrace ""Yilongtuomai""."
"27208148","abstracttext","Yellow or stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating foliar disease that affects common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) around the world. In China, common wheat landraces are potential sources of disease and abiotic stress resistance genes for wheat improvement. Yilongtuomai (YL), a wheat landrace from Yilong County, Sichuan Province, shows high levels of resistance against most Chinese Pst races. In this study, the resistance of YL to stripe rust disease was examined in detail. Parent strains, YL and Taichung 29, a variety susceptible to Pst race CYR32, and their F1, F2, and F2:3 offspring, were inoculated with CYR32 during the seedling stage in the field or adult-plant stage in the greenhouse. Results indicated that resistance to CYR32 in YL is conferred by a single dominant gene, designated YrYL The segregating F2 population (352 plants), was analyzed in terms of its resistance locus using simple sequence repeats (SSRs), resistance gene analog polymorphisms (RGAPs), and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP). A linkage group of 6 SSRs, 2 RGAPs, and 1 SRAP was constructed for the YrYL gene. Using the identified SSRs associated with physical mapping of RGAP using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic stocks, the YrYL gene was localized to the short arm of chromosome 7D. The gene was flanked by 1 SSR marker, Xbarc92, and 1 RGAP marker, CLRRfor/Ptokin4, at genetic distances of 5.35 and 9.86 cM, respectively. The YrYL gene was compared to other stripe rust resistance genes reported on chromosome 7D by evaluating its reaction patterns to CYR32 and its pedigree relationship. Our results suggest that the YrYL gene is a new stripe rust resistance gene."
"18270436","articletitle","Chromosome arm location of the genes for the biosynthesis of hordatines in barley."
"18270436","abstracttext","Hordatines A and B, the strong antifungal compounds in barley (Hordeum vulgare), are biosynthesized from p-coumaroyl- and feruloyl-CoA and agmatine by two successive reactions catalyzed by agmatine coumaroyltransferase (ACT) and peroxidase. ACT catalyzes the formation of agmatine conjugates (p-coumaroylagmatine and feruloylagmatine) from precursor CoAs and agmatine, and peroxidase catalyzes the oxidative coupling of agmatine conjugates to form hordatines. Our previous study demonstrated that the short arm of barley chromosome 2H (2HS) is responsible for the biosynthesis of hordatines. In the present study, however, barley genes encoding the ACT (HvACT) and a peroxidase (HvPrx7) were found to be located on the long arm of 2H (2HL). The amounts of hordatines and precursor agmatine conjugates were analyzed in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and wheat lines carrying a whole 2H chromosome, 2HS or 2HL. The addition of 2H and 2HL elevated the levels of agmatine conjugates in wheat. This could be attributed to the HvACT on 2HL. However, the content of agmatine conjugates increased also in the 2HS addition line, suggesting the presence of another unidentified ACT gene on 2HS. Hordatines were detected in wheat, but their content was by far lower than those in barley. The 2H and 2HS addition lines accumulated substantial amounts of hordatines, while the 2HL addition line accumulated them as little as wheat did in spite of the substantial transcription of the HvPrx7 gene on 2HL and of the increased accumulation of the precursor agmatine conjugates. These facts suggest that the HvPrx7 gene on 2HL is not involved in the hordatine biosynthesis and that unidentified peroxidase gene responsible for the hordatine biosynthesis is located on 2HS in barley."
"16183849","articletitle","Allelic series of four powdery mildew resistance genes at the Pm3 locus in hexaploid bread wheat."
"16183849","abstracttext","At the Pm3 locus in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), 10 alleles conferring race-specific resistance to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) are known. A cluster of genes encoding coiled-coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat proteins spans the Pm3 locus on wheat chromosome 1A, and one member of this gene family has recently been identified as the Pm3b resistance gene. Using molecular markers closely linked to Pm3b, we performed haplotype analysis of 10 lines carrying different Pm3 alleles. All these lines have a conserved genomic region delimited by markers cosegregating with Pm3b and including a structurally conserved Pm3b-like gene. A polymerase chain reaction-based strategy allowed the amplification of one Pm3b-like sequence from lines carrying Pm3a, Pm3d, and Pm3f alleles. These candidate genes for Pm3a, Pm3d, and Pm3f conferred AvrPm3a-, AvrPm3d-, and AvrPm3f-dependent resistance, respectively, to wheat powdery mildew in a single cell transient transformation assay. A high level of amino acid similarity (97.8%) was found between the PM3A, PM3B, PM3D, and PM3F proteins. The coiled-coil domain was 100% conserved, whereas, in the nucleotide binding site region, sequence exchange was detected, indicating intragenic recombination or gene conversion between alleles. All these results indicate that Pm3a, Pm3b, Pm3d, and Pm3f form a true allelic series. The low level of sequence divergence between the four characterized alleles as well as the finding of a conserved Pm3 haplotype are in agreement with the hypothesis of a recent evolution of Pm3-based resistance, suggesting that some or most of the diversity found at the Pm3 locus in modern wheat has evolved after wheat domestication."

"16222089","abstracttext","To investigate if there is an EDR1 pathway in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a pair of degenerate primers was designed according to the cDNAs of Arabidopsis thaliana EDR1 gene and its homologs were used to isolate EDR1 gene homologs from wheat. RT-PCR was conducted on the cDNA template synthesized with RNA of wheat leaves. A 627-bp cDNA fragment representing an EDR1 gene (named as TaEDR1) was isolated (GenBank accession number: AY743662). Subsequently, the 3050-bp full-length cDNA sequence of TaEDR1, which encodes a polypeptide consisting of 959 amino acid residues, was obtained by RACE technique. The amino acid sequence of TaEDR1 and that of barley (Hordeum vulgare) EDR1 (signed as HvEDR1) show 92% identity. There is a highly conserved catalytic domain of serine/threonine protein kinases in the C-terminus of TaEDR1. Because this protein has a putative nuclear localization motif, it probably functions in the nucleus. This study provides the first molecular biological evidence of the presence of an EDR1 homolog in common wheat. The transcription pattern of TaEDR1 was investigated in leaves after inoculation with Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici Em. Marchal (Bgt) through semi-quantitative RT-PCR (semi-QRT-PCR). The result showed that the transcribing of TaEDR1 was enhanced by Bgt. The expression pattern of the TaEDR1 gene in different tissues showed that it expressed in leaves, stems, spikes and roots. This study suggests that the TaEDR1, a MAP kinase kinase kinase, may function in wheat defense responses."

"16937702","abstracttext","The Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is a major pest of bread wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (em Thell), in most wheat-growing areas worldwide. Aphid-resistant cultivars are used to combat this pest, but very little is known about the molecular basis of resistance. In this study, differential gene expression in D. noxia biotype 1-resistant wheat plants containing the Dnx gene and D. noxia biotype 1 feeding on Dnx plants was investigated using suppressive subtraction hybridization. The derived subtracted cDNA library includes sequences similar to Pto and Pti1, genes involved in gene-for-gene recognition of and resistance to bacterial speck disease in tomato, Lycopersicon esculentum (L.). Pto- and Pti1-like sequences contain an activation domain with conserved amino acid residues crucial for avr protein recognition and binding by Pto, and avr-Pto phosphorylation of Pti1. Wheat defense signaling is represented by sequences putatively involved in producing sterols, jasmonates, Ca2+, and abscisic and gibberellic acids. We suggest that reductions in populations of D. noxia fed Dnx plants are related to the expression of sequences involved in defensive chemical production, cellular transport, and exocytosis. Dnx plant tolerance of D. noxia feeding is proposed to be based on the expression of sequences putatively involved in self-defense against reactive oxygen species and toxins, and proteolysis; DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis; chloroplast and mitochondrial function; carbohydrate metabolism; and maintenance of cell homeostasis. D. noxia unsuccessfully counter Dnx by expressing sequences putatively involved in detoxification; proteolysis; DNA, RNA, protein, and lipid synthesis; carbohydrate metabolism; and mitochondrial function."
"21502188","articletitle","Control of abscisic acid catabolism and abscisic acid homeostasis is important for reproductive stage stress tolerance in cereals."
"21502188","abstracttext","Drought stress at the reproductive stage causes pollen sterility and grain loss in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Drought stress induces abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis genes in anthers and ABA accumulation in spikes of drought-sensitive wheat varieties. In contrast, drought-tolerant wheat accumulates lower ABA levels, which correlates with lower ABA biosynthesis and higher ABA catabolic gene expression (ABA 8'-hydroxylase). Wheat TaABA8'OH1 deletion lines accumulate higher spike ABA levels and are more drought sensitive. ABA treatment of the spike mimics the effect of drought, causing high levels of sterility. ABA treatment represses the anther cell wall invertase gene TaIVR1, and drought-tolerant lines appeared to be more sensitive to the effect of ABA. Drought-induced sterility shows similarity to cold-induced sterility in rice (Oryza sativa). In cold-stressed rice, the rate of ABA accumulation was similar in cold-sensitive and cold-tolerant lines during the first 8 h of cold treatment, but in the tolerant line, ABA catabolism reduced ABA levels between 8 and 16 h of cold treatment. The ABA biosynthesis gene encoding 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase in anthers is mainly expressed in parenchyma cells surrounding the vascular bundle of the anther. Transgenic rice lines expressing the wheat TaABA8'OH1 gene under the control of the OsG6B tapetum-specific promoter resulted in reduced anther ABA levels under cold conditions. The transgenic lines showed that anther sink strength (OsINV4) was maintained under cold conditions and that this correlated with improved cold stress tolerance. Our data indicate that ABA and ABA 8'-hydroxylase play an important role in controlling anther ABA homeostasis and reproductive stage abiotic stress tolerance in cereals."

"28698232","abstracttext","Many important genes in agriculture correspond to transcription factors (TFs) that regulate a wide range of pathways from flowering to responses to disease and abiotic stresses. In this study, we identified 5776 TFs in hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and classified them into gene families. We further investigated the NAC family exploring the phylogeny, C-terminal domain (CTD) conservation, and expression profiles across 308 RNA-seq samples. Phylogenetic trees of NAC domains indicated that wheat NACs divided into eight groups similar to rice ( Oryza sativa ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ). CTD motifs were frequently conserved between wheat, rice, and barley within phylogenetic groups; however, this conservation was not maintained across phylogenetic groups. Three homeologous copies were present for 58% of NACs, whereas evidence of single homeolog gene loss was found for 33% of NACs. We explored gene expression patterns across a wide range of developmental stages, tissues, and abiotic stresses. We found that more phylogenetically related NACs shared more similar expression patterns compared to more distant NACs. However, within each phylogenetic group there were clades with diverse expression profiles. We carried out a coexpression analysis on all wheat genes and identified 37 modules of coexpressed genes of which 23 contained NACs. Using gene ontology (GO) term enrichment, we obtained putative functions for NACs within coexpressed modules including responses to heat and abiotic stress and responses to water: these NACs may represent targets for breeding or biotechnological applications.

"32765555","articletitle","Diverse Wheat-Alien Introgression Lines as a Basis for Durable Resistance and Quality Characteristics in Bread Wheat."
"32765555","abstracttext","Wheat productivity has been significantly improved worldwide through the incorporation of novel genes from various gene pools, not least from wild relatives of wheat, into the commonly cultivated bread and durum wheat. Here, we present and summarize results obtained from a diverse set of wheat-alien introgression lines with mainly introgressions of rye, but also of Leymus spp. and Thinopyrum junceiforme into bread-wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). From this material, lines carrying 2RL were found with good agronomic performance and multiple resistance not least towards several races of powdery mildew. A novel resistance gene, one of few showing resistance towards all today identified stem rust races, designated Sr59 , was also found originating from 2RL. Lines with multiple introgressions from 4R, 5R, and 6R were found resistant towards the majority of the stripe rust races known today. Due to lack of agricultural adaptation in these lines, transfer of useful genes into more adapted wheat material is a necessity, work which is also in progress through crosses with the CS ph1b mutant, to be able to only transfer small chromosome segments that carry the target gene. Furthermore, resistance towards Russian wheat aphid was found in lines having a substitution of 1R (1D) and translocations of 3DL.3RS and 5AL.5RS. The rye chromosomes 1R, 2R, and 6R were found responsible for resistance towards the Syrian Hessian fly. High levels of especially zinc was found in several lines obtained from crosses with Leymus racemosus and Leymus mollis , while also some lines with 1R, 2R, or 5R showed increased levels of minerals and in particular of iron and zinc. Moreover, lines with 1R, 2R, 3R, and Leymus spp. introgressions were also found to have a combination of high iron and zinc and low cadmium concentrations. High variation was found both in grain protein concentration and gluten strength, measured as %UPP, within the lines, indicating large variation in bread-making quality. Thus, our study emphasizes the impact that wheat-alien introgression lines can contribute to current wheat lines and shows large opportunities both to improve production, resistance, and quality. To obtain such improvements, novel plant breeding tools, as discussed in this paper, opens unique opportunities, to transfer suitable genes into the modern and adapted wheat cultivars."

We assessed the presence of mariner transposase-like sequences in M. destructor by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay designed to detect conserved regions of the mariner transposase gene. DNA sequence analysis of PCR products revealed sequences with similarities to putative mariner transposase gene subfamilies from Drosophila mauritiana and horn fly, Haematobia irritans. DNA gel blot analyses indicated sequences hybridizing to the mariner transposase-like PCR clones occur at a moderate to low copy number in M. destructor. Results suggest the presence of an endogenous mobile-element system in M. destructor, which might be developed into a gene transfer system or serve in mapping genes."

"9952464","abstracttext","We report the expression of the barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) COR (cold-regulated) gene cor14b (formerly pt59) and the accumulation of its chloroplast-localized protein product. A polyclonal antibody raised against the cor14b-encoded protein detected two chloroplast COR proteins: COR14a and COR14b. N-terminal sequencing of COR14a and expression of cor14b in Arabidopsis plants showed that COR14a is not encoded by the cor14b sequence, but it shared homology with the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) WCS19 COR protein. The expression of cor14b was strongly impaired in the barley albino mutant an, suggesting the involvement of a plastidial factor in the control of gene expression. Low-level accumulation of COR14b was induced by cold treatment in etiolated plants, although cor14b expression and protein accumulation were enhanced after a short light pulse. Light quality was a determining factor in regulating gene expression: red or blue but not far-red or green light pulses were able to promote COR14b accumulation in etiolated plants, suggesting that phytochrome and blue light photoreceptors may be involved in the control of cor14b gene expression. Maximum accumulation of COR14b was reached only when plants were grown and/or hardened under the standard photoperiod. The effect of light on the COR14b stability was demonstrated by using transgenic Arabidopsis. These plants constitutively expressed cor14b mRNAs regardless of temperature and light conditions; nevertheless, green plants accumulated about twice as much COR14b protein as etiolated plants."

"19005086","abstracttext","Plants have evolved complex regulatory mechanisms to control the defense response against microbial attack. Both temporal and spatial gene expression are tightly regulated in response to pathogen ingress, modulating both positive and negative control of defense. BLUFENSIN1 (BLN1), a small peptide belonging to a novel family of proteins in barley (Hordeum vulgare), is highly induced by attack from the obligate biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), casual agent of powdery mildew disease. Computational interrogation of the Bln1 gene family determined that members reside solely in the BEP clade of the Poaceae family, specifically, barley, rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). Barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing of Bln1 enhanced plant resistance in compatible interactions, regardless of the presence or absence of functional Mla coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site, Leu-rich repeat alleles, indicating that BLN1 can function in an R-gene-independent manner. Likewise, transient overexpression of Bln1 significantly increased accessibility toward virulent Bgh. Moreover, silencing in plants harboring the Mlo susceptibility factor decreased accessibility to Bgh, suggesting that BLN1 functions in parallel with or upstream of MLO to modulate penetration resistance. Collectively, these data suggest that the grass-specific Bln1 negatively impacts basal defense against Bgh."

Here, we show that the accumulation in barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) of double-stranded or antisense RNA targeting fungal transcripts affects the development of the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis. Proof of concept for host-induced gene silencing was obtained by silencing the effector gene Avra10, which resulted in reduced fungal development in the absence, but not in the presence, of the matching resistance gene Mla10. The fungus could be rescued from the silencing of Avra10 by the transient expression of a synthetic gene that was resistant to RNA interference (RNAi) due to silent point mutations. The results suggest traffic of RNA molecules from host plants into B. graminis and may lead to an RNAi-based crop protection strategy against fungal pathogens."

"32480822","abstracttext","TaNHX2, a vacuolar Na+-H+ antiport gene from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), was transformed into alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to evaluate the role of vacuolar energy providers in plant salt stress responses. PCR and Southern blotting analysis showed that the target gene was integrated into the Medicago genome. Reverse transcription-PCR indicated that gene TaNHX2 was expressed at the transcriptional level. The relative electrical conductivity in the T2 transgenic plants was lower and the osmotic potential was higher compared to the wild-type plants under salt stress conditions. The tonoplast H+-ATPase, H+-pyrophosphatase (PPase) hydrolysis activities and ATP-dependent proton pump activities in transgenic plants were all higher than those of wild-type plants, and the enzyme activities could be induced by salt stress. The PPi-dependent proton pump activities decreased when NaCl concentrations increased from 100mM to 200mM, especially in transgenic plants. The vacuolar Na+-H+ antiport activities of transgenic plants were 2-3 times higher than those of the wild -type plants under 0mM and 100mM NaCl stress. Na+-H+ antiport activity was not detectable for wild-type plants under 200mM NaCl, but for transgenic plants, it was further increased with an increment in salt stress intensity. These results demonstrated that expression of the foreign TaNHX2 gene enhanced salt tolerance in transgenic alfalfa."

"33199756","abstracttext","Evidence for ancestral gene transfer between Epichloë fungal endophyte ancestors and their host grass species is described. From genomes of cool-season grasses (the Poeae tribe), two Epichloë-originated genes were identified through DNA sequence similarity analysis. The two genes showed 96% and 85% DNA sequence identities between the corresponding Epichloë genes. One of the genes was specific to the Loliinae sub-tribe. The other gene was more widely conserved in the Poeae and Triticeae tribes, including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The genes were independently transferred during the last 39 million years. The transferred genes were expressed in plant tissues, presumably retaining molecular functions. Multiple gene transfer events between the specific plant and fungal lineages are unique. A range of cereal crops is included in the Poeae and Triticeae tribes, and the Loliinae sub-tribe is consisted of economically important pasture and forage crops. Identification and characterisation of the 'natural' adaptation transgenes in the genomes of cereals, and pasture and forage grasses, that worldwide underpin the production of major foods, such as bread, meat, and milk, may change the 'unnatural' perception status of transgenic and gene-edited plants."

"19760389","abstracttext","Wheat powdery mildew is an economically important disease in cool and humid environments. Powdery mildew causes yield losses as high as 48% through a reduction in tiller survival, kernels per head, and kernel size. Race-specific host resistance is the most consistent, environmentally friendly and, economical method of control. The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm line NC06BGTAG12 possesses genetic resistance to powdery mildew introgressed from the AAGG tetraploid genome Triticum timopheevii subsp. armeniacum. Phenotypic evaluation of F(3) families derived from the cross NC06BGTAG12/'Jagger' and phenotypic evaluation of an F(2) population from the cross NC06BGTAG12/'Saluda' indicated that resistance to the 'Yuma' isolate of powdery mildew was controlled by a single dominant gene in NC06BGTAG12. Bulk segregant analysis (BSA) revealed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers specific for chromosome 7AL segregating with the resistance gene. The SSR markers Xwmc273 and Xwmc346 mapped 8.3 cM distal and 6.6 cM proximal, respectively, in NC06BGTAG12/Jagger. The multiallelic Pm1 locus maps to this region of chromosome 7AL. No susceptible phenotypes were observed in an evaluation of 967 F(2) individuals in the cross NC06BGTAG12/'Axminster' (Pm1a) which indicated that the NC06BGTAG12 resistance gene was allelic or in close linkage with the Pm1 locus. A detached leaf test with ten differential powdery mildew isolates indicated the resistance in NC06BGTAG12 was different from all designated alleles at the Pm1 locus. Further linkage and allelism tests with five other temporarily designated genes in this very complex region will be required before giving a permanent designation to this gene. At this time the gene is given the temporary gene designation MlAG12."

"32849677","abstracttext","Polyploidies produce a large number of duplicated regions and genes in genomes, which have a long-term impact and stimulate genetic innovation. The high similarity between homeologous chromosomes, forming different subgenomes, or homologous regions after genome repatterning, may permit illegitimate DNA recombination. Here, based on gene colinearity, we aligned the (sub)genomes of common wheat ( Triticum aestivum , AABBDD genotype) and its relatives, including Triticum urartu (AA), Aegilops tauschii (DD), and T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (AABB) to detect the homeologous (paralogous or orthologous) colinear genes within and between (sub)genomes. Besides, we inferred more ancient paralogous regions produced by a much ancient grass-common tetraploidization. By comparing the sequence similarity between paralogous and orthologous genes, we assumed abnormality in the topology of constructed gene trees, which could be explained by gene conversion as a result of illegitimate recombination. We found large numbers of inferred converted genes (>2,000 gene pairs) suggested long-lasting genome instability of the hexaploid plant, and preferential donor roles by DD genes. Though illegitimate recombination was much restricted, duplicated genes produced by an ancient whole-genome duplication, which occurred millions of years ago, also showed evidence of likely gene conversion. As to biological function, we found that ~40% catalytic genes in colinearity, including those involved in starch biosynthesis, were likely affected by gene conversion. The present study will contribute to understanding the functional and structural innovation of the common wheat genome."

"12554717","abstracttext","A DNA fragment corresponding to part of an SNF1 (sucrose non-fermenting-1)-related protein kinase (SnRK1) transcript was amplified by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a wheat (Triticum aestivum) endosperm cDNA library. It was used to construct a chimaeric gene, pUasSnRKN, comprising a ubiquitin promoter, the SnRK1 PCR product in the antisense orientation and the nopaline synthase (Nos) gene terminator. This construct was used in transient gene expression experiments in cultured wheat embryos together with a series of reporter gene constructs. These included the wheat alpha amylase gene alpha-Amy2 promoter with UidA (Gus) coding region (palpha2GT), rice actin promoter with Gus (pActIDGus), ubiquitin promoter with Gus (pAHC25) and actin promoter with green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (pAct1Is-GFP1). All of the reporter genes were found to be active when bombarded into scutellae isolated from immature grains at 25 d post-anthesis and incubated on MS medium for 24 h prior to bombardment. However, co-bombardment of palpha2GT with equimolar amounts of pUasSnRKN resulted in no detectable Gus activity, indicating that the antisense SnRK1 construct repressed the alpha-Amy2 promoter. Co-bombardment with pUasSnRKN had no effect on the activity of the other promoters used in the study. A triple bombardment with palpha2GT, pAct1Is-GFP-1 and pUasSnRKN resulted in clear green fluorescence, indicating that the bombarded cells were still viable, but no Gus activity. RT-PCR analysis showed clearly that the antisense SnRK1 gene was expressing. Northern and RT-PCR analyses confirmed that SnRK1 and both alpha-amylase genes, alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2, are expressed in cultured wheat embryos harvested from grain 25 d post-anthesis. Expression of alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2 was up-regulated by sugar starvation."

The leaf rust resistance gene in WX93D246-R-1 was located on wheat chromosome 2D by monosomic analysis. Molecular marker analysis of F(2) plants from non-critical crosses determined that this gene is 11.2 cM distal to marker Xgwm210 on the short arm of 2D. No susceptible plants were detected in a population of 300 F(2) plants from a cross between WX93D246-R-1 and TA 4186 ( Lr39), suggesting that the gene in WX93D246-R-1 is the same as, or closely linked to, Lr39. In addition, no susceptible plants were detected in a population of 180 F(2) plants from the cross between KS90WGRC10 and WX93D246-R-1. The resistance gene in KS90WGRC10, Lr41, was previously reported to be located on wheat chromosome 1D. In this study, no genetic association was found between Lr41 and 51 markers located on chromosome 1D. A population of 110 F(3 )lines from a cross between KS90WGRC10 and TAM 107 was evaluated with polymorphic SSR markers from chromosome 2D and marker Xgdm35 was found to be 1.9 cM proximal to Lr41. When evaluated with diverse isolates of Puccinia triticina, similar reactions were observed on WX93D246-R-1, KS90WGRC10, and TA 4186. The results of mapping, allelism, and race specificity test indicate that these germplasms likely have the same gene for resistance to leaf rust."

Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a destructive disease affecting the production of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Powdery mildew resistance was putatively transferred from Thinopyrum intermedium to the common wheat line L962, which conferred resistance to multiple Chinese Bgt isolates. Genetic analysis of the powdery mildew response was conducted by crossing the resistant line L962 with the susceptible line L983. Disease assessments of the F1, F2, and F2:3 populations from the cross L983/L962 indicated that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. A total of 373 F2:3 lines and 781 pairs of genomic simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were employed to determine the chromosomal location of the resistance gene. The gene was linked to four publicly available and recently developed wheat genomic SSR markers and seven EST-STS markers. The resistance gene was mapped to chromosome arm 2BS based on the locations of the linked markers. Pedigree, molecular marker and resistance response data indicated that the powdery mildew resistance gene in L962 is novel. It was temporarily designated PmL962. It is flanked by Xwmc314 and BE443737at genetic distances of 2.09 and 3.74 cM, respectively, and located in a 20.77 cM interval that is co-linear with a 269.4 kb genomic region on chromosome 5 in Brachypodium distachyon and a 223.5 kb genomic region on rice (Oryza sativa) chromosome 4. The markers that are closely linked to this gene have potential applications in marker-assisted breeding."

"26476691","abstracttext","Earliness per se (Eps) genes account for the variation in flowering time when vernalization and photoperiod requirements are satisfied. Genomics and bioinformatics approaches were used to describe allelic variation for 40 Triticum aestivum genes predicted, by synteny with Brachypodium distachyon, to be in the 1DL Eps region. Re-sequencing 1DL genes revealed that varieties carrying early heading alleles at this locus, Spark and Cadenza, carry a subtelomeric deletion including several genes. The equivalent region in Rialto and Avalon is intact. A bimodal distribution in the segregating Spark X Rialto single seed descent (SSD) populations enabled the 1DL QTL to be defined as a discrete Mendelian factor, which we named Eps-D1. Near isogenic lines (NILs) and NIL derived key recombinants between markers flanking Eps-D1 suggest that the 1DL deletion contains the gene(s) underlying Eps-D1. The deletion spans the equivalent of the Triticum monoccocum Eps-A (m) 1 locus, and hence includes MODIFIER OF TRANSCRIPTION 1 (MOT1) and FTSH PROTEASE 4 (FTSH4), the candidates for Eps-A (m) 1. The deletion also contains T. aestivum EARLY FLOWERING 3-D1 (TaELF3-D1) a homologue of the Arabidopsis thaliana circadian clock gene EARLY FLOWERING 3. Eps-D1 is possibly a homologue of Eps-B1 on chromosome 1BL. NILs carrying the Eps-D1 deletion have significantly reduced total TaELF3 expression and altered TaGIGANTEA (TaGI) expression compared with wild type. Altered TaGI expression is consistent with an ELF3 mutant, hence we propose TaELF3-D1 as the more likely candidate for Eps-D1. This is the first direct fine mapping of Eps effect in bread wheat."

"9079883","abstracttext","Low-temperature (LT) induced genes of the Wcs120 family in wheat (Triticum aestivum) were mapped to specific chromosome arms using Western and Southern blot analysis on the ditelocentric series in the cultivar Chinese Spring (CS). Identified genes were located on the long arms of the homoeologous group 6 chromosomes of all 3 genomes (A, B, and D) of hexaploid wheat. Related species carrying either the A, D, or AB genomes were also examined using Southern and Western analysis with the Wcs120 probe and the WCS120 antibody. All closely related species carrying one or more of the genomes of hexaploid wheat produced a 50 kDa protein that was identified by the antibody, and a Wcs120 homoeologue was detected by Southern analysis in all species. In the absence of chromosome arm 6DL in hexaploid CS wheat no 50 kDa protein was produced and the high-intensity Wcs120 band was missing, indicating 6DL as the location of Wcs120 but suggesting silencing of the Wcs120 homoeologue in the A genome. Levels of proteins that cross-reacted with the Wcs120 antibody and degrees of cold tolerance were also investigated in the Chinese Spring/Cheyenne (CS/CNN) chromosome substitution series. CNN chromosome 5A increased the cold tolerance of CS wheat. Densitometry scanning of Western blots to determine protein levels showed that the group 5 chromosome 5A had a regulatory effect on the expression of the Wcs120 gene family located on the group 6 chromosomes of all three hexaploid wheat genomes."

Higher density comparative maps using PCR-based anchor markers are necessary to better estimate the conservation of colinearity among cereal genomes.

"17849220","articletitle","Flavonoid profiling among wild type and related GM wheat varieties."
"17849220","abstracttext","Pleiotropic effects are one of the main concerns regarding genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This includes unintended side effects of the transgene or its genome insertion site on the regulation of other endogenous genes, which could potentially cause the accumulation of different secondary metabolites that may have not only an impact on diet as repeatedly worried by the public but also on the environment. Regarding amount and possible environmental effects, flavonoids represent the most prominent group of secondary metabolites in wheat. Many flavonoids function as signalling or defence molecules. We used a robust and reproducible analytical method to compare the flavonoid content of genetically modified (GM) wheat (Triticum aestivum L., Gramineae) expressing genes that confer increased fungal resistance with their non-GM siblings. The transgenes provide either a broad-spectrum fungal defence (chitinase/glucanase from barley) or bunt-specific resistance by a viral gene (KP4). Significant differences in flavonoid composition were found between different wheat varieties whereas different lines of GM wheat with increased antifungal resistance showed only minor differences in their flavonoid composition relative to their non-GM siblings. In a field test, no significant differences were detectable between infected and non-infected wheat of the same variety regardless of the presence of the transgene. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis that the transgenes we used to increase wheat defence to fungal pathogens do not interfere with the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway. More significantly, the genetic background resulting from conventional breeding has a direct impact on the biological composition of flavonoids, and thus possibly on the environment."

"16911585","abstracttext","Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42) is a polyploid species possessing one of the largest genomes among the cultivated crops (1C is approximately 17 000 Mb). The presence of three homoeologous genomes (A, B and D), and the prevalence of repetitive DNA make sequencing the wheat genome a daunting task. We have developed a novel 'chromosome arm-based' strategy for wheat genome sequencing to simplify this task; this relies on sub-genomic libraries of large DNA inserts. In this paper, we used a di-telosomic line of wheat to isolate six million copies of the short arm of chromosome 1B (1BS) by flow sorting. Chromosomal DNA was partially digested with HindIII and used to construct an arm-specific BAC library. The library consists of 65 280 clones with an average insert size of 82 kb. Almost half of the library (45%) has inserts larger than 100 kb, while 18% of the inserts range in size between 75 and 100 kb, and 37% are shorter than 75 kb. We estimated the chromosome arm coverage to be 14.5-fold, giving a 99.9% probability of identifying a clone corresponding to any sequence on the short arm of 1B. Each chromosome arm in wheat can be flow sorted from an appropriate cytogenetic stock, and we envisage that the availability of chromosome arm-specific BAC resources in wheat will greatly facilitate the development of ready-to-sequence physical maps and map-based gene cloning."

"19480702","abstracttext_background","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a staple food crop worldwide. The wheat genome has not yet been sequenced due to its huge genome size (approximately 17,000 Mb) and high levels of repetitive sequences; the whole genome sequence may not be expected in the near future. Available linkage maps have low marker density due to limitation in available markers; therefore new technologies that detect genome-wide polymorphisms are still needed to discover a large number of new markers for construction of high-resolution maps. A high-resolution map is a critical tool for gene isolation, molecular breeding and genomic research. Single feature polymorphism (SFP) is a new microarray-based type of marker that is detected by hybridization of DNA or cRNA to oligonucleotide probes.

Microarray analysis of 71 recombinant inbred lines from the cross Ning 7840/Clark identified 955 SFPs and 877 of them were mapped together with 269 simple sequence repeat markers. The SFPs were randomly distributed within a chromosome but were unevenly distributed among different genomes. The B genome had the most SFPs, and the D genome had the least.

"21710462","abstracttext","Resistance gene analog-expressed sequence tag (RGA-EST)-based markers have been used for variety discrimination and studies of genetic diversity in wheat. Our aim is to increase the competitiveness of public wheat breeding programs through intensive use of modern selection technologies, mainly marker-assisted selection. The genetic diversity of 77 wheat nucleotide binding site (NBS)-containing RGA-ESTs was assessed. Resistant and susceptible bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes were used as sources of DNA for PCR amplifications. In our previous studies, the F₂ individuals derived from the combinations PI178383 x Harmankaya99, Izgi2001 x ES14, and Sonmez2001 x Aytin98 were evaluated for yellow rust resistance at both seedling and adult stages to identify DNA markers. We have now examined the genetic variability among the resistant and susceptible Turkish wheat cultivars for yellow rust disease and the mean genetic distance between the cultivars. The highest similarity was 0.500 between Harmankaya99 and Sonmez2001. The lowest similarity was 0.286 between Aytin98, PI178383 and Aytin98, ES14. A relatively high level (49.5%) of polymorphism was observed with 77 RGA-EST primers across the six wheat genotypes, despite the fact that all of them were local cultivars from geographically close locations. RGA-EST sequences were compared by BlastX algorithms for amino acid sequences to determine the polymorphic categories among the combinations. BlastX analyses of six RGA-ESTs that gave polymorphic patterns for all combinations were NBS-LRR class RGA, NB-ARC domain containing protein, NBS-type resistance protein RGC5, NBS-LRR-S/ TPK stem rust resistance protein, and putative MLA1 proteins, while 38 RGA-EST gave a monomorphic pattern."

"22257084","abstracttext","The effect of light on gene expression and hormonal status during the development of freezing tolerance was studied in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Mv Emese) and in the spring wheat variety Nadro. Ten-day-old plants (3-leaf stage) were cold hardened at 5°C for 12 days under either normal (250 µmol m(-2) s(-1) ) or low (20 µmol m(-2) s(-1) ) light conditions. Comprehensive analysis was carried out to explore the background of frost tolerance and the differences between these wheat varieties. Global genome analysis was performed, enquiring about the details of the cold signaling pathways. The expression level of a large number of genes is affected by light, and this effect may differ in different wheat genotypes. Photosynthesis-related processes probably play a key role in the enhancement of freezing tolerance; however, there are several other genes whose induction is light-dependent, so either there is cross-talk between signaling of chloroplast originating and other protective mechanisms or there are other light sensors that transduce signals to the components responsible for stress tolerance. Changes in the level of both plant hormones (indole-3-acetic acid, cytokinins, nitric oxide and ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid) and other stress-related protective substances (proline, phenolics) were investigated during the phases of the hardening period. Hormonal levels were also affected by light and their dynamics indicate that wheat plants try to keep growing during the cold-hardening period. The data from this experiment may provide a new insight into the cross talk between cold and light signaling in wheat."

"23745731","abstracttext","Wheat seeds can be released from a dormant state by after-ripening; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still mostly unknown. We previously identified transcriptional programmes involved in the regulation of after-ripening-mediated seed dormancy decay in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Here, we show that seed dormancy maintenance and its release by dry after-ripening in wheat is associated with oxidative modification of distinct seed-stored mRNAs that mainly correspond to oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome biogenesis, nutrient reservoir and α-amylase inhibitor activities, suggesting the significance of post-transcriptional repression of these biological processes in regulating seed dormancy. We further show that after-ripening induced seed dormancy release in wheat is mediated by differential expression of specific proteins in both dry and hydrated states, including those involved in proteolysis, cellular signalling, translation and energy metabolism. Among the genes corresponding to these proteins, the expression of those encoding α-amylase/trypsin inhibitor and starch synthase appears to be regulated by mRNA oxidation. Co-expression analysis of the probesets differentially expressed and oxidized during dry after-ripening along with those corresponding to proteins differentially regulated between dormant and after-ripened seeds produced three co-expressed gene clusters containing more candidate genes potentially involved in the regulation of seed dormancy in wheat. Two of the three clusters are enriched with elements that are either abscisic acid (ABA) responsive or recognized by ABA-regulated transcription factors, indicating the association between wheat seed dormancy and ABA sensitivity."

"22844501","abstracttext","Mutagenesis is an important tool in crop improvement. However, the hexaploid genome of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) presents problems in identifying desirable genetic changes based on phenotypic screening due to gene redundancy. TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes), a powerful reverse genetic strategy that allows the detection of induced point mutations in individuals of the mutagenized populations, can address the major challenge of linking sequence information to the biological function of genes and can also identify novel variation for crop breeding. Wheat is especially well-suited for TILLING due to the high mutation densities tolerated by polyploids. However, only a few wheat TILLING populations are currently available in the world, which is far from satisfying the requirement of researchers and breeders in different growing environments. In addition, current TILLING screening protocols require costly fluorescence detection systems, limiting their use, especially in developing countries. We developed a new TILLING resource comprising 2610 M(2) mutants in a common wheat cultivar 'Jinmai 47'. Numerous phenotypes with altered morphological and agronomic traits were observed from the M(2) and M(3) lines in the field. To simplify the procedure and decrease costs, we use unlabeled primers and either non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels or agarose gels for mutation detection. The value of this new resource was tested using PCR with RAPD and Intron-spliced junction (ISJ) primers, and also TILLING in three selected candidate genes, in 300 and 512 mutant lines, revealing high mutation densities of 1/34 kb by RAPD/ISJ analysis and 1/47 kb by TILLING. In total, 31 novel alleles were identified in the 3 targeted genes and confirmed by sequencing. The results indicate that this mutant population represents a useful resource for the wheat research community. We hope that the use of this reverse genetics resource will provide novel allelic diversity for wheat improvement and functional genomics."
"24964057","articletitle","Virus-induced gene silencing suggests (1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase is a susceptibility factor in the compatible russian wheat aphid-wheat interaction."
"24964057","abstracttext","The Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), is a significant insect pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and has a major economic impact worldwide, especially on winter wheat in the western United States. The continuing emergence of new RWA biotypes virulent to existing resistance genes reinforces the need for more durable resistance. Studies have indicated that resistance in previously susceptible plants can be produced by knock-down of susceptibility genes or other genes involved in host plant susceptibility. Therefore, investigation into genes involved in compatible RWA-wheat interactions could be a feasible approach to achieving durable RWA resistance. The objective of this study was to test whether silencing (1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase, previously observed to be highly induced in susceptible compared with resistant wheat during aphid infestation, would confer resistance to a susceptible wheat genotype. Barley stripe mosaic virus-mediated virus-induced gene silencing was employed to test whether (1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase is involved in the susceptible reaction of 'Gamtoos-S' (GS). Controlled infestation with U.S. biotype RWA2 was done to assess aphid reproduction and host symptom development. Aphids on (1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase-silenced plants reproduced less per day and had longer prenymphipositional periods than those on control GS plants. Furthermore, the (1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase-silenced plants exhibited less chlorosis and greater dry weight compared with GS. Aphid reproduction and host plant symptom development showed linear relationships with (1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase transcript levels. Our results suggest that (1,3;1,4)-β-glucanase is required for successful infestation by the RWA and may be a susceptibility factor that could be exploited as a potential target for RWA resistance breeding."

"24561479","abstracttext","The Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) can cause cell death in wheat (Triticum aestivum), but can also reduce the level of cell death caused by heat shock in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cell cultures. We show that 10 μg mL(-1) DON does not cause cell death in Arabidopsis cell cultures, and its ability to retard heat-induced cell death is light dependent. Under dark conditions, it actually promoted heat-induced cell death. Wheat cultivars differ in their ability to resist this toxin, and we investigated if the ability of wheat to mount defense responses was light dependent. We found no evidence that light affected the transcription of defense genes in DON-treated roots of seedlings of two wheat cultivars, namely cultivar CM82036 that is resistant to DON-induced bleaching of spikelet tissue and cultivar Remus that is not. However, DON treatment of roots led to genotype-dependent and light-enhanced defense transcript accumulation in coleoptiles. Wheat transcripts encoding a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene (previously associated with Fusarium resistance), non-expressor of pathogenesis-related genes-1 (NPR1) and a class III plant peroxidase (POX) were DON-upregulated in coleoptiles of wheat cultivar CM82036 but not of cultivar Remus, and DON-upregulation of these transcripts in cultivar CM82036 was light enhanced. Light and genotype-dependent differences in the DON/DON derivative content of coleoptiles were also observed. These results, coupled with previous findings regarding the effect of DON on plants, show that light either directly or indirectly influences the plant defense responses to DON."
"25047236","articletitle","Gluten quality of bread wheat is associated with activity of RabD GTPases."
"25047236","abstracttext","In the developing endosperm of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), seed storage proteins are produced on the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to protein bodies, specialized vacuoles for the storage of protein. The functionally important gluten proteins of wheat are transported by two distinct routes to the protein bodies where they are stored: vesicles that bud directly off the ER and transport through the Golgi. However, little is known about the processing of glutenin and gliadin proteins during these steps or the possible impact on their properties. In plants, the RabD GTPases mediate ER-to-Golgi vesicle transport. Available sequence information for Rab GTPases in Arabidopsis, rice, Brachypodium and bread wheat was compiled and compared to identify wheat RabD orthologs. Partial genetic sequences were assembled using the first draft of the Chinese Spring wheat genome. A suitable candidate gene from the RabD clade (TaRabD2a) was chosen for down-regulation by RNA interference (RNAi), and an RNAi construct was used to transform wheat plants. All four available RabD genes were shown by qRT-PCR to be down-regulated in the transgenic developing endosperm. The transgenic grain was found to produce flour with significantly altered processing properties when measured by farinograph and extensograph. SE-HPLC found that a smaller proportion of HMW-GS and large proportion of LMW-GS are incorporated into the glutenin macropolymer in the transgenic dough. Lower protein content but a similar protein profile on SDS-PAGE was seen in the transgenic grain."

"26220905","abstracttext","Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very long chain (VLC) fatty acids and their derivatives in which primary alcohols are the most abundant components in the leaf surface of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). However, the genes involved in primary alcohol biosynthesis in wheat are still largely unknown. Here we identified, via a homology-based approach, the TaFAR1 gene belonging to the fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs) from wheat. Heterologous expression of TaFAR1 in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cer4-3 mutant afforded production of C22 primary alcohol and C22-C24 primary alcohols, respectively, and transgenic expression of TaFAR1 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cv MicroTom leaves and fruits resulted in the accumulation of C26-C30 primary alcohols and C30-C34 primary alcohols, respectively. The TaFAR1 protein was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in rice (Oryza sativa L.) leaf protoplasts. Moreover, the TaFAR1 expression pattern across various organs correlated with the levels of primary alcohols accumulating in corresponding waxes, and with the presence of platelet-shaped epicuticular wax crystals formed by primary alcohols. A nullisomic-tetrasomic wheat line lacking TaFAR1 had significantly reduced levels of primary alcohols in its leaf blade and anther wax. TaFAR1 was located on chromosome 4AL and appeared to be highly conserved, with only one haplotype among 32 wheat cultivars. Finally, TaFAR1 expression was induced by drought and cold stress in an ABA-dependent manner. Taken together, our results show that TaFAR1 is an active enzyme forming primary alcohols destined for the wheat cuticle."

"25983132","abstracttext","The study evaluates the effect of rhizobacteria having 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCd) on the development of wheat seedlings. This enzyme has been proposed to play a key role in microbe-plant association. Three fluorescent pseudomonads containing this deaminase were selected from 70 strains of pseudomonads isolated from rhizosphere of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rape (Brassica napus L.). These bacteria, varied significantly in the ability to both biosynthesize auxins and hydrolyze ACC. Among them, Pseudomonas brassicacearum subsp. brassicacearum strain RZ310 presented the highest activities of ACC deaminase during 96h of growth in liquid Dworkin and Foster (DF) salt medium. Additionally, this rape rhizosphere strain did not produce indoles. Two other isolates, Pseudomonas sp. PO283 and Pseudomonas sp. PO366, secreted auxins only in the presence of their precursor. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and four other protein-encoding genes indicated that these wheat rhizosphere isolates belonged to the fluorescent Pseudomonas group. Moreover, the effects of these strains on wheat seedling growth under in vitro conditions were markedly dependent on both their cell suspensions used to grain inoculation and nutrient conditions. Strains tested had beneficial influence on wheat seedlings mainly at low cell densities. In addition, access to nutrients markedly changed bacteria action on cereal growth. Their presence generally favored the positive effects of pseudomonads on length and the estimated biomasses of wheat coleoptiles. Despite these general rules, impacts of each isolate on the growth parameters of cereal seedlings were unique."

"26839581","abstracttext_background","Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) has become an emerging technology for the rapid, efficient functional genomic screening of monocot and dicot species. The barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) has been described as an effective VIGS vehicle for the evaluation of genes involved in wheat and barley phytopathogenesis; however, these studies have been obscured by BSMV-induced phenotypes and defense responses. The utility of BSMV VIGS may be improved using a BSMV genetic background which is more tolerable to the host plant especially upon secondary infection of highly aggressive, necrotrophic pathogens such as Fusarium graminearum."
"26839581","abstracttext_results","BSMV-induced VIGS in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) cv. 'Fielder' was assessed for the study of wheat genes putatively related to Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), the necrotrophism of wheat and other cereals by F. graminearum. Due to the lack of 'Fielder' spike viability and increased accumulation of Fusarium-derived deoxynivalenol contamination upon co-infection of BSMV and FHB, an attenuated BSMV construct was generated by the addition of a glycine-rich, C-terminal peptide to the BSMV γ b protein. This attenuated BSMV effectively silenced target wheat genes while limiting disease severity, deoxynivalenol contamination, and yield loss upon Fusarium co-infection compared to the original BSMV construct. The attenuated BSMV-infected tissue exhibited reduced abscisic, jasmonic, and salicylic acid defense phytohormone accumulation upon secondary Fusarium infection. Finally, the attenuated BSMV was used to investigate the role of the salicylic acid-responsive pathogenesis-related 1 in response to FHB."
"26839581","abstracttext_conclusions","The use of an attenuated BSMV may be advantageous in characterizing wheat genes involved in phytopathogenesis, including Fusarium necrotrophism, where minimal viral background effects on defense are required. Additionally, the attenuated BSMV elicits reduced defense hormone accumulation, suggesting that this genotype may have applications for the investigation of phytohormone-related signaling, developmental responses, and pathogen defense."

"32457385","abstracttext","Natural tolerance in hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to synthetic auxin herbicides is primarily due to rapid metabolic detoxification, but genes encoding these herbicide-detoxifying enzymes have yet to be identified. Herbicide safeners are commonly applied in wheat to achieve herbicide tolerance by inducing the expression and activity of herbicide-detoxifying enzymes. While safeners have been utilized for decades, knowledge of mechanisms that induce gene expression is limited. Our objective was to identify wheat chromosomes possessing genes that endow natural or safener-induced tolerance to halauxifen-methyl (HM), a postemergence (POST) wheat-selective synthetic auxin herbicide, using alien substitution (the S genome of Aegilops searsii) and aneuploid lines. Two POST rates of HM were applied to seedlings with 1-2 leaves (Zadoks stages 11-12), and the highest HM rate was also applied with the safener cloquintocet-mexyl (CM). Wheat chromosomes possessing genes associated only with natural HM tolerance were identified because Ae. searsii is HM-sensitive but CM-responsive. Lines with substitutions for 5A and 5B displayed sensitivity to HM, and experiments with nullisomic-tetrasomic (NT) lines further indicated major genes associated with HM tolerance are present on 5A and 5B chromosomes. However, the genes on 5A appear to play a larger role because lines lacking 5A chromosomes displayed more sensitivity than lines lacking 5B. Overall, these results can be utilized to guide future transcriptome analyses to identify candidate genes that confer HM tolerance in wheat."

"32480776","abstracttext","Various genetic-based approaches including mutant population screens, microarray analyses, cloning and transgenesis have broadened our knowledge of gene function during meiosis in plants. Nonetheless, these genetic tools are not without inherent limitations. One alternative approach to studying plant meiosis, especially in polyploids such as Triticum aestivum L. (bread wheat), is proteomics. However, protein-based approaches using proteomics have seldom been described, with only two attempts at studying early plant meiosis reported. Here, we report the investigation of early bread wheat meiosis using proteomics. Five differentially expressed protein spots were identified using 2D gel electrophoresis (2DGE) on protein extracts from four pooled stages of meiosis and three genotypes (Chinese Spring wild-type, ph1b and ph2a wheat mutant lines). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) identification of peptides from these protein spots led to the isolation and characterisation of the full-length clones of a wheat Speckle-type POZ protein, an SF21-like protein and HSP70, and a partial coding sequence of a hexose transporter. Significantly, the putative functions of the Speckle-type POZ protein and HSP70 were confirmed using in vitro DNA binding assays. Through the use of a 2DGE proteomics approach, we show that proteomics is a viable alternative to genetic-based approaches when studying meiosis in wheat. More significantly, we report a potential role for a Speckle-type POZ protein and a HSP70 in chromosome pairing during the early stages of meiosis in bread wheat."
"30044519","articletitle","TaWRKY51 promotes lateral root formation through negative regulation of ethylene biosynthesis in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"30044519","abstracttext","Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important staple food crop worldwide. Lateral roots (LRs), as the major component of root architecture, affect water and nutrient uptake in wheat. The phytohormone ethylene is known to affect LR formation; however, the factor(s) modulating ethylene during this process have not yet been elucidated in wheat. Here we identified wheat TaWRKY51 as a key factor that functions in LR formation by modulating ethylene biosynthesis. Wheat TaWRKY51RNA interference lines (TaWRKY51-RNAi) and the homozygous mutants tawrky51-2a and tawrky51-2b all produced fewer LRs than the wild type and negative transgenic plants, whereas the TaWRKY51 overexpression lines (TaWRKY51-OE) had the opposite phenotype. Transcription analysis revealed that 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) genes (TaACS2, TaACS7 and TaACS8) involved in ethylene biosynthesis were downregulated in TaWRKY51-OE lines but upregulated in TaWRKY51-RNAi lines. The rate of ethylene production also decreased in TaWRKY51-OE lines but increased in TaWRKY51-RNAi lines compared with their respective negative transgenic controls. Electrophoretic mobility shift and transient expression assays revealed that TaWRKY51 inhibits the expression of ACS genes by binding to the W-box cis-element present in their promoter region. Moreover, overexpression of ACS2 or exogenous application of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid reversed the phenotype of enhanced LR number in TaWRKY51-OE Arabidopsis lines, and overexpression of TaWRKY51 in the ethylene-overproducing mutant eto1-1 rescued its LR defect phenotype. In addition, genetic evidence demonstrates that TaWRKY51-regulated LR formation is also dependent on ethylene and auxin signaling pathways. Our findings reveal a molecular genetic mechanism by which a WRKY gene coordinates ethylene production and LR formation in wheat."

"30081829","abstracttext_background","Synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW) is a reconstitution of hexaploid wheat from its progenitors (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum L.; AABB x Aegilops tauschii Coss.; DD) and has novel sources of genetic diversity for broadening the genetic base of elite bread wheat (BW) germplasm (T. aestivum L). Understanding the diversity and population structure of SHWs will facilitate their use in wheat breeding programs. Our objectives were to understand the genetic diversity and population structure of SHWs and compare the genetic diversity of SHWs with elite BW cultivars and demonstrate the potential of SHWs to broaden the genetic base of modern wheat germplasm."
"30081829","abstracttext_results","The genotyping-by-sequencing of SHW provided 35,939 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were distributed across the A (33%), B (36%), and D (31%) genomes. The percentage of SNPs on the D genome was nearly same as the other two genomes, unlike in BW cultivars where the D genome polymorphism is generally much lower than the A and B genomes. This indicates the presence of high variation in the D genome in the SHWs. The D genome gene diversity of SHWs was 88.2% higher than that found in a sample of elite BW cultivars. Population structure analysis revealed that SHWs could be separated into two subgroups, mainly differentiated by geographical location of durum parents and growth habit of the crop (spring and winter type). Further population structure analysis of durum and Ae. parents separately identified two subgroups, mainly based on type of parents used. Although Ae. tauschii parents were divided into two sub-species: Ae. tauschii ssp. tauschii and ssp. strangulate, they were not clearly distinguished in the diversity analysis outcome. Population differentiation between SHWs (Spring_SHW and Winter_SHW) samples using analysis of molecular variance indicated 17.43% of genetic variance between populations and the remainder within populations."
"30081829","abstracttext_conclusions","SHWs were diverse and had a clearly distinguished population structure identified through GBS-derived SNPs.

"30707418","abstracttext","Wheat is the most widely grown staple food crop in the world and accounts for dietary needs of more than 35% of the human population. Current status of transgenic wheat development is slow all over the world due to the lack of a suitable transformation system. In the present study, an efficient and reproducible Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is established. The mature and immature embryos of six recently released high yielding spring bread wheat genotypes were used to standardize various parameters using Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 harbouring binary vector pCAMBIA3301 having gus and bar as marker genes. The optimum duration for embryo pre-culture, inoculation time and co-cultivation were 2 days, 30 min and 48 h, respectively. The bacterial inoculum concentration of OD of 1 at 600 nm showed 67.25% transient GUS expression in the histochemical GUS assay. The filter paper based co-cultivation limits the Agrobacterium overgrowth and had 82.3% explants survival rate whereas medium based strategy had 22.7% explants survival only. The medium having picloram 4 mg/l along with antibiotics (cefotaxime 500 mg/l and timentin 300 mg/l) was found best suitable for initial week callus induction. The standardized procedure gave overall 14.9% transformation efficiency in immature embryos and 9.8% in mature embryos and confirmed by gene-specific and promoter-specific PCR and southern analysis. These results indicate that the developed Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system is suitable for diverse wheat genotypes. The major obstacle for the implication of the CRISPR-based genome editing techniques is the non-availability of a suitable transformation system. Thus, the present system can be exploited to deliver the T-DNA into the wheat genome for CRISPR-based target modifications and transgene insertions."

"33224986","abstracttext","OVATE family proteins (OFPs) are plant-specific transcription factors that play important roles in plant development. Although common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is a major staple food worldwide, OFPs have not been systematically analyzed in this important crop. Here, we performed a genome-wide survey of OFP genes in wheat and identified 100 genes belonging to 34 homoeologous groups. Arabidopsis thaliana , rice ( Oryza sativa ), and wheat OFP genes were divided into four subgroups based on their phylogenetic relationships. Structural analysis indicated that only four TaOFPs contain introns. We mapped the TaOFP genes onto the wheat chromosomes and determined that TaOFP17 was duplicated in this crop. A survey of cis-acting elements along the promoter regions of TaOFP genes suggested that subfunctionalization of homoeologous genes might have occurred during evolution. The TaOFPs were highly expressed in wheat, with tissue- or organ-specific expression patterns. In addition, these genes were induced by various hormone and stress treatments. For instance, TaOPF29a-A was highly expressed in roots in response to drought stress. Wheat plants overexpressing TaOPF29a-A had longer roots and higher dry weights than nontransgenic plants under drought conditions, suggesting that this gene improves drought tolerance. Our findings provide a starting point for further functional analysis of this important transcription factor family and highlight the potential of using TaOPF29a-A to genetically engineer drought-tolerant crops."

"23397275","abstracttext_key message","The wheat eIF2 homolog, TaIF2, is induced by the stripe rust pathogen CYR 32 at an early stage of inoculation and is related to the innate immunity resistance level in wheat. The initiation of translation represents a critical control point in the regulation of gene expression in all organisms. We previously identified an upregulated EST S186 (EL773056) from an SSH-cDNA library of the Shaanmai 139 strain of wheat (Triticum aestivum) infected with Puccinia striiformis (Pst). In the present work, we isolated a cDNA clone and identified it as a wheat IF2 homolog. This cDNA consisted of 1,314 nucleotides and contained an open reading frame of 795 nucleotides encoding a polypeptide of 254 amino acids. The amino acids represent a conserved domain in EF-Tu, mtIF2-II, and mtIF2-Ivc. The alignment result showed that it maybe a partial cDNA of the initiation factor 2/eukaryotic initiation factor 5B (IF2/eIF5B) superfamily gene. Paradoxically, results of a Swiss-model analysis suggesting a low QMEAN Z-score implied that it was a membrane protein. Quantitative RT-PCR studies confirmed that the wheat eIF2 (TaIF2) homolog was differentially expressed in three near-isogenic lines. Critical time points for the induction of resistance by inoculation with Pst CYR32 in YrSM139-1B + YrSM139-2D immune resistance genotype occurred at 1 and 3 dpi (days post-infection). RNAi test showed that the inoculated BSMV-IF2 leaves of Shaanmai 139 showed obvious cell death after 15 days of inoculation with CYR 32. qRT-PCR analysis of the target gene in cDNA samples isolated from BSMV-IF2-Pst, BSMV-0-Pst and Pst infected leaves confirmed that the expression of TaIF2 is suppressed by BSMV-IF2 at 3 dpi. This suggested that TaIF2/eIF5B plays an important role in the mechanism of innate immunity to stripe rust pathogen."

"24904613","abstracttext","A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for heading date (HD) was performed with a panel of 358 European winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties and 14 spring wheat varieties through the phenotypic evaluation of HD in field tests in eight environments. Genotyping data consisted of 770 mapped microsatellite loci and 7934 mapped SNP markers derived from the 90K iSelect wheat chip. Best linear unbiased estimations (BLUEs) were calculated across all trials and ranged from 142.5 to 159.6 days after the 1st of January with an average value of 151.4 days. Considering only associations with a -log10 (P-value) ≥ 3.0, a total of 340 SSR and 2983 SNP marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected. After Bonferroni correction for multiple testing, a total of 72 SSR and 438 SNP marker-trait associations remained significant. Highly significant MTAs were detected for the photoperiodism gene Ppd-D1, which was genotyped in all varieties. Consistent associations were found on all chromosomes with the highest number of MTAs on chromosome 5B. Linear regression showed a clear dependence of the HD score BLUEs on the number of favorable alleles (decreasing HD) and unfavorable alleles (increasing HD) per variety meaning that genotypes with a higher number of favorable or a low number of unfavorable alleles showed lower HD and therefore flowered earlier. For the vernalization gene Vrn-A2 co-locating MTAs on chromosome 5A, as well as for the photoperiodism genes Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1 on chromosomes 2A and 2B were detected. After the construction of an integrated map of the SSR and SNP markers and by exploiting the synteny to sequenced species, such as rice and Brachypodium distachyon, we were able to demonstrate that a marker locus on wheat chromosome 5BL with homology to the rice photoperiodism gene Hd6 played a significant role in the determination of the heading date in wheat."

"24121568","abstracttext_key message","Identified SSR markers ( Xcfd49 and Xbarc183 ) linked with stem rust resistance for efficient use in marker-assisted selection and stacking of resistance genes in wheat breeding programs. More than 80 % of the worldwide wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) area is currently sown with varieties susceptible to the Ug99 race group of stem rust fungus. However, wheat lines Niini, Tinkio, Coni, Pfunye, Blouk, and Ripper have demonstrated Ug99 resistance at the seedling and adult plant stages. We mapped stem rust resistance in populations derived from crosses of a susceptible parent with each of the resistant lines. The segregation of resistance in each population indicated the presence of a single gene. The resistance gene in Niini mapped to short arm of chromosome 6D and was flanked by SSR markers Xcfd49 at distances of 3.9 cM proximal and Xbarc183 8.4 cM distal, respectively. The chromosome location of this resistance was validated in three other populations: PBW343/Coni, PBW343/Tinkio, and Cacuke/Pfunye. Resistance initially postulated to be conferred by the SrTmp gene in Blouk and Ripper was also linked to Xcfd49 and Xbarc183 on 6DS, but it was mapped proximal to Xbarc183 at a similar position to previously mapped genes Sr42 and SrCad. Based on the variation in diagnostic marker alleles, it is possible that Niini and Pfunye may carry different resistance genes/alleles. Further studies are needed to determine the allelic relationships between various genes located on chromosome arm 6DS.

"30861827","abstracttext","The Lr41 gene for resistance to leaf rust, caused by Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici, was transferred from Triticum tauschii accession TA2460 to bread wheat (T. aestivum) at the Wheat Genetics Resource Center, Kansas State University (1). Due to the high degree of resistance (primary leaf infection types [ITs] 0; to ;1 = [0 to 4 scale]) conferred to South African pathotypes of leaf rust, the gene was considered potentially valuable in local programs directed at wheat germ plasm improvement. During routine glasshouse tests for seedling resistance to the South African leaf rust pathotype UVPrt16, several sporulating pustules (IT 4) were observed among flecks on wheat line KS90WGRC10 (TAM107*3/TA2460). Rust cultures multiplied from these pustules were tested on seedlings of 31 wheat lines with different Lr genes in a growth cabinet at 20°C. Their avirulence/virulence characteristics suggested a single-step mutation for virulence to Lr41. According to North American nomenclature (2), the Lr41-virulent isolate is classified as race FDC-14b,20,23,25,33,41. Low ITs were recorded on additional testers with Lr3bg, 14a, 15, 18, 19, 27+31, 28, and 29, and intermediate ITs on lines with Lr2b, 10, 21, 32, and 36. Infection studies on adult plants showed that KS90WGRC10 and its recurrent parent TAM107 produced similar susceptible reactions (Its 3 ++ C) to the mutant. T. tauschii accession TA2460, however, was moderately susceptible (IT 2 + ) to this culture. Virulence to Lr41 has not been recorded in field populations of the pathogen in South Africa. The occurrence of virulence to Lr41 emphasized the nondurability of monogenic resistance and thus the importance of conserving genetic diversity for leaf rust resistance. To protect Lr41 from becoming obsolete, it should be used only in combination with other effective resistance gene(s). References: (1) T. S. Cox et al. Crop Sci. 32:506, 1992. (2) D. L. Long and J.

"31141279","abstracttext","Development of marker-free and transgene insertion site-defined (MFTID) transgenic plants is essential for safe application of transgenic crops. However, MFTID plants have not been reported for wheat (Triticum aestivum). Here, we prepared a RNAi cassette for suppressing lipoxygenase (LOX) gene expression in wheat grains using a double right border T-DNA vector. The resultant construct was introduced into wheat genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, with four homozygous marker-free transgenic lines (namely GLRW-1, -3, -5 and -8) developed. Aided by the newly published wheat genome sequence, the T-DNA insertion sites in GLRW-3 and GLRW-8 were elucidated at base-pair resolution. While the T-DNA in GLRW-3 inserted in an intergenic region, that of GLRW-8 inactivated an endogenous gene, which was thus excluded from further analysis. Compared to wild -type (WT) control, GLRW-1, -3 and -5 showed decreased LOX gene expression, lower LOX activity and less lipid peroxidation in the grains; they also exhibited significantly higher germination rates and better seedling growth after artificial ageing treatment. Interestingly, the three GLRW lines also had substantially increased contents of several fatty acids (e.g., linoleic acid and linolenic acid) in their grain and flour samples than WT control. Collectively, our data suggest that suppression of grain LOX activity can be employed to improve the storability and fatty acid content of wheat seeds and that the MFTID line GLRW-3 is likely of commercial value. Our approach may also be useful for developing the MFTID transgenic lines of other crops with enhanced grain storability and fatty acid content."

"31681420","abstracttext","Seed dormancy and germination are important agronomic traits in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) because they determine pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) resistance and thus affect grain production. These processes are regulated by Gibberellic Acid-Stimulated Regulator ( GASR ) genes. In this study, we identified 37 GASR genes in common wheat, which were designated TaGASR1-37 . Moreover, we identified 40 pairs of paralogous genes, of which only one had a Ka/Ks value greater than 1, indicating that most TaGASR genes have undergone negative selection. Chromosomal location and duplication analysis revealed 25 pairs of segmentally duplicated genes and seven pairs of tandemly duplicated genes, suggesting that large-scale duplication events may have contributed to the expansion of TaGASR gene family. Microarray analysis of the expression of 18 TaGASR genes indicated that these genes play diverse roles in different biological processes. Using wheat varieties with contrasting seed dormancy phenotypes, we investigated the expression patterns of TaGASR genes and the corresponding seed germination index phenotypes in response to water imbibition, exogenous ABA and GA treatment, and low- and high-temperature treatment. Based on these data, we identified the TaGASR34 gene as potentially associated with seed dormancy and germination. Further, we used a SNP mutation of the TaGASR34 promoter (-16) to develop the CAPS marker GS34-7B, which was then used to validate the association of TaGASR34 with seed dormancy and germination by evaluating two natural populations across environments. Notably, the frequency of the high-dormancy GS34-7Bb allele was significantly lower than that of the low-dormancy GS34-7Ba allele, implying that the favorable GS34-7Bb allele has not previously been used in wheat breeding. These results provide valuable information for further functional analysis of TaGASR genes and present a useful gene and marker combination for future improvement of PHS resistance in wheat."
"12913142","articletitle","TaVRT-1, a putative transcription factor associated with vegetative to reproductive transition in cereals."
"12913142","abstracttext","The molecular genetics of vernalization, defined as the promotion of flowering by cold treatment, is still poorly understood in cereals. To better understand this mechanism, we cloned and characterized a gene that we named TaVRT-1 (wheat [Triticum aestivum] vegetative to reproductive transition-1). Molecular and sequence analyses indicated that this gene encodes a protein homologous to the MADS-box family of transcription factors that comprises certain flowering control proteins in Arabidopsis. Mapping studies have localized this gene to the Vrn-1 regions on the long arms of homeologous group 5 chromosomes, regions that are associated with vernalization and freezing tolerance (FT) in wheat. The level of expression of TaVRT-1 is positively associated with the vernalization response and transition from vegetative to reproductive phase and is negatively associated with the accumulation of COR genes and degree of FT. Comparisons among different wheat genotypes, near-isogenic lines, and cereal species, which differ in their vernalization response and FT, indicated that the gene is inducible only in those species that require vernalization, whereas it is constitutively expressed in spring habit genotypes. In addition, experiments using both the photoperiod-sensitive barley (Hordeum vulgare cv Dicktoo) and short or long day de-acclimated wheat revealed that the expression of TaVRT-1 is also regulated by photoperiod. These expression studies indicate that photoperiod and vernalization may regulate this gene through separate pathways. We suggest that TaVRT-1 is a key developmental gene in the regulatory pathway that controls the transition from the vegetative to reproductive phase in cereals."

"25415194","abstracttext","Powdery mildew (PM) is a very destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat-Thinopyrum ponticum introgression line CH7086 was shown to possess powdery mildew resistance possibly originating from Th. ponticum. Genomic in situ hybridization and molecular characterization of the alien introgression failed to identify alien chromatin. To study the genetics of resistance, CH7086 was crossed with susceptible genotypes. Segregation in F2 populations and F2:3 lines tested with Chinese Bgt race E09 under controlled conditions indicated that CH7086 carries a single dominant gene for powdery mildew resistance. Fourteen SSR and EST-PCR markers linked with the locus were identified. The genetic distances between the locus and the two flanking markers were 1.5 and 3.2 cM, respectively. Based on the locations of the markers by nullisomic-tetrasomic and deletion lines of 'Chinese Spring', the resistance gene was located in deletion bin 2BL-0.89-1.00. Conserved orthologous marker analysis indicated that the genomic region flanking the resistance gene has a high level of collinearity to that of rice chromosome 4 and Brachypodium chromosome 5. Both resistance specificities and tests of allelism suggested the resistance gene in CH7086 was different from previously reported powdery mildew resistance genes on 2BL, and the gene was provisionally designated PmCH86. Molecular analysis of PmCH86 compared with other genes for resistance to Bgt in the 2BL-0.89-1.00 region suggested that PmCH86 may be a new PM resistance gene, and it was therefore designated as Pm51. The closely linked flanking markers could be useful in exploiting this putative wheat-Thinopyrum translocation line for rapid transfer of Pm51 to wheat breeding programs."

"28202046","abstracttext_background","Lr16 is a widely deployed leaf rust resistance gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that is highly effective against the North American Puccinia triticina population when pyramided with the gene Lr34. Lr16 is a seedling leaf rust resistance gene conditioning an incompatible interaction with a distinct necrotic ring surrounding the uredinium. Lr16 was previously mapped to the telomeric region of the short arm of wheat chromosome 2B. The goals of this study were to develop numerous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for the Lr16 region and identify diagnostic gene-specific SNP marker assays for marker-assisted selection (MAS)."
"28202046","abstracttext_results","Forty-three SNP markers were developed and mapped on chromosome 2BS tightly linked with the resistance gene Lr16 across four mapping populations representing a total of 1528 gametes. Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) assays were designed for all identified SNPs. Resistance gene analogs (RGAs) linked with the Lr16 locus were identified and RGA-based SNP markers were developed. The diagnostic potential of the SNPs co-segregating with Lr16 was evaluated in a diverse set of 133 cultivars and breeding lines. Six SNP markers were consistent with the Lr16 phenotype and are accurately predictive of Lr16 for all wheat lines/cultivars in the panel."

"24317598","articletitle","Genetic variability and improvement of seed proteins in wheat."
"24317598","abstracttext","Albumins, globulins, gliadins and glutenins presumably comprising 100 percent of the wheat seed proteins were sequentially extracted and electrophoresed on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The SDS-electrophoretic patterns within each of the four fractions from T. boeotiaum, T. urartu, T. turgidum, T. timopheevii, T. aestivum, Ae. speltoides and Ae. squawosa were similar. They differed from one species to another only in a few minor components or density of certain components. Similarity in MW's of components, as indicated by the SDS-electrophoretic patterns, suggests that the wheats and Aegilops exhibit no variability for structural genes coding seed proteins. A minimum of 60 to 70 and a maximum of 360 to 420 structural genes with major or minor effects control the total seed protein in T. aestivum. Presumably, only one or the other homoeoallele was expressed in the polyploids. Different components of albumins and globulins presumably had distinct MW's and amino acid composition, while the components of gliadins and glutenins could be classified into a few groups each containing one or more components with the same MW and nearly identical amino acid composition. The genes for components with similar MW's and amino acid composition arose through multiplication of a single original gene and perhaps share the same regulatory mechanism. Seed protein content and quality in wheat might be improved through the incorporation of structural genes, coding for polypeptides with distinct MW's, from distantly related species, rather than by manipulation of the structural genes within the Triticum-Aegilops group. Regulatory mutants similar to opaque-2 of corn could be used to alter the proportion of gliadins in relation to albumins and globulins, to improve amino acid composition of wheat proteins."
"15514041","articletitle","Group 3 chromosome bin maps of wheat and their relationship to rice chromosome 1."
"15514041","abstracttext","The focus of this study was to analyze the content, distribution, and comparative genome relationships of 996 chromosome bin-mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs) accounting for 2266 restriction fragments (loci) on the homoeologous group 3 chromosomes of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Of these loci, 634, 884, and 748 were mapped on chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D, respectively. The individual chromosome bin maps revealed bins with a high density of mapped ESTs in the distal region and bins of low density in the proximal region of the chromosome arms, with the exception of 3DS and 3DL. These distributions were more localized on the higher-resolution group 3 consensus map with intermediate regions of high-mapped-EST density on both chromosome arms. Gene ontology (GO) classification of mapped ESTs was not significantly different for homoeologous group 3 chromosomes compared to the other groups. A combined analysis of the individual bin maps using 537 of the mapped ESTs revealed rearrangements between the group 3 chromosomes. Approximately 232 (44%) of the consensus mapped ESTs matched sequences on rice chromosome 1 and revealed large- and small-scale differences in gene order. Of the group 3 mapped EST unigenes approximately 21 and 32% matched the Arabidopsis coding regions and proteins, respectively, but no chromosome-level gene order conservation was detected."
"15208399","articletitle","Widespread paleopolyploidy in model plant species inferred from age distributions of duplicate genes."
"15208399","abstracttext","It is often anticipated that many of today's diploid plant species are in fact paleopolyploids. Given that an ancient large-scale duplication will result in an excess of relatively old duplicated genes with similar ages, we analyzed the timing of duplication of pairs of paralogous genes in 14 model plant species. Using EST contigs (unigenes), we identified pairs of paralogous genes in each species and used the level of synonymous nucleotide substitution to estimate the relative ages of gene duplication. For nine of the investigated species (wheat [Triticum aestivum], maize [Zea mays], tetraploid cotton [Gossypium hirsutum], diploid cotton [G. arboretum], tomato [Lycopersicon esculentum], potato [Solanum tuberosum], soybean [Glycine max], barrel medic [Medicago truncatula], and Arabidopsis thaliana), the age distributions of duplicated genes contain peaks corresponding to short evolutionary periods during which large numbers of duplicated genes were accumulated. Large-scale duplications (polyploidy or aneuploidy) are strongly suspected to be the cause of these temporal peaks of gene duplication. However, the unusual age profile of tandem gene duplications in Arabidopsis indicates that other scenarios, such as variation in the rate at which duplicated genes are deleted, must also be considered."
"17110994","articletitle","The Sbm1 locus conferring resistance to Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus maps to a gene-rich region on 5DL in wheat."
"17110994","abstracttext","A mosaic disease caused by Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (SBCMV) is becoming increasingly important, particularly in winter wheat in Europe. As there are currently no effective cultural practices or practical environmentally friendly chemicals for disease control, host plant resistance is an important objective in breeding programs. However, development of resistant cultivars is slow owing to difficulties in germplasm screening for resistance. Therefore, there is a need to identify molecular markers linked to SBCMV-resistance gene(s), so that quick and accurate laboratory-based marker-assisted selection rather than prolonged field-based screens for resistance can be used in developing resistant cultivars. We previously demonstrated that resistance to SBCMV in Triticum aestivum 'Cadenza' is controlled by a single locus. In this work, we used AFLP and microsatellite technology to map this resistance locus, with the proposed name Sbm1, to the distal end of chromosome 5DL. Interestingly, several expressed disease-resistance gene analogues also map to this gene-rich region on 5DL. Closely linked (approximately 17 cM interval) markers, BARC110 and WMC765, RRES01 and BARC144, that flank Sbm1 will be very useful in breeding for selection of germplasm carrying Sbm1."
"17981986","articletitle","A set of modular binary vectors for transformation of cereals."
"17981986","abstracttext","Genetic transformation of crop plants offers the possibility of testing hypotheses about the function of individual genes as well as the exploitation of transgenes for targeted trait improvement. However, in most cereals, this option has long been compromised by tedious and low-efficiency transformation protocols, as well as by the lack of versatile vector systems. After having adopted and further improved the protocols for Agrobacterium-mediated stable transformation of barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), we now present a versatile set of binary vectors for transgene overexpression, as well as for gene silencing by double-stranded RNA interference. The vector set is offered with a series of functionally validated promoters and allows for rapid integration of the desired genes or gene fragments by GATEWAY-based recombination. Additional in-built flexibility lies in the choice of plant selectable markers, cassette orientation, and simple integration of further promoters to drive specific expression of genes of interest. Functionality of the cereal vector set has been demonstrated by transient as well as stable transformation experiments for transgene overexpression, as well as for targeted gene silencing in barley."

"18651124","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the most widespread diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. With the objective of identifying and mapping new genes for resistance to leaf rust, F(1), F(2) plants and F(3) lines from a cross between resistant line Zhou 8425B and susceptible line Chinese Spring were inoculated with Chinese P. triticina races THTT and MBHP in the greenhouse. A total of 793 pairs of SSR primers were used to test the parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. Seven polymorphic chromosome 1B markers were used for genotyping the F(2) and F(3) populations. Zhou 8425B carried a single dominant resistance gene, temporarily designated LrZH84, linked to SSR markers gwm582 and barc8 with genetic distances of 3.9 and 5.2 cM, respectively. The Xbarc8 allele co-segregated with Lr26 in the F(3) population. The Xgwm582 allele associated with LrZH84 was identified as a leaf rust resistance gene and shown to be present in the Predgornaia 2 parent of Zhou 8425B. The seedling reaction pattern of LrZH84 was different from those of lines with Lr26, Lr33, Lr44 and Lr46, all of which are located in chromosome 1B. It was concluded that LrZH84 is likely to be a new leaf rust resistance gene."
"19671879","articletitle","The mediator complex subunit PFT1 is a key regulator of jasmonate-dependent defense in Arabidopsis."
"19671879","abstracttext","Jasmonate signaling plays an important role in both plant defense and development. Here, we have identified a subunit of the Mediator complex as a regulator of the jasmonate signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. The Mediator complex is a conserved multiprotein complex that acts as a universal adaptor between transcription factors and the RNA polymerase II transcriptional machinery. We report that the PHYTOCHROME AND FLOWERING TIME1 (PFT1) gene, which encodes the MEDIATOR25 subunit of Mediator, is required for jasmonate-dependent defense gene expression and resistance to leaf-infecting necrotrophic fungal pathogens. Conversely, PFT1 appears to confer susceptibility to Fusarium oxysporum, a root-infecting hemibiotrophic fungal pathogen known to hijack jasmonate responses for disease development. Consistent with this, jasmonate gene expression was suppressed in the pft1 mutant during infection with F. oxysporum. In addition, a wheat (Triticum aestivum) homolog of PFT1 complemented the defense and the developmental phenotypes of the pft1 mutant, suggesting that the jasmonate signaling functions of PFT1 may be conserved in higher plants. Overall, our results identify an important control point in the regulation of the jasmonate signaling pathway within the transcriptional machinery."

"23386294","abstracttext","While in dicotyledonous plants virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is well established to study plant-pathogen interaction, in monocots only few examples of efficient VIGS have been reported so far. One of the available systems is based on the brome mosaic virus (BMV) which allows gene silencing in different cereals including barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays).Infection of maize plants by the corn smut fungus Ustilago maydis leads to the formation of large tumors on stem, leaves, and inflorescences. During this biotrophic interaction, plant defense responses are actively suppressed by the pathogen, and previous transcriptome analyses of infected maize plants showed comprehensive and stage-specific changes in host gene expression during disease progression.To identify maize genes that are functionally involved in the interaction with U. maydis, we adapted a VIGS system based on the Brome mosaic virus (BMV) to maize at conditions that allow successful U. maydis infection of BMV pre-infected maize plants. This setup enables quantification of VIGS and its impact on U. maydis infection using a quantitative real-time PCR (q(RT)-PCR)-based readout."
"23400831","articletitle","Function of the wheat TaSIP gene in enhancing drought and salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis and rice."
"23400831","abstracttext","Microarray analysis of a salt-tolerant wheat mutant identified a gene of unknown function that was induced by exposure to high levels of salt and subsequently denoted TaSIP (Triticum aestivum salt-induced protein). Quantitative PCR analysis revealed that TaSIP expression was induced not only by salt, but also by drought, abscisic acid (ABA), and other environmental stress factors. Transgenic rice plants that expressed an RNA interference construct specific for a rice gene homologous to TaSIP was more susceptible to salt stress than wild-type rice plants. Subcellular localization studies showed that the TaSIP localized to the cell membrane. Under conditions of salt and drought stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpressed TaSIP showed superior physiological properties compared with control plants, including lower Na(+) content and upregulation of several stress resistance genes. Staining of transgenic tissues with β-glucuronidase (GUS) failed to indicate tissue-specific activity of the full-length TaSIP promoter. Quantitative analysis of GUS fluorescence in transgenic plants treated with ABA or salt stress revealed that the region 1,176-1,410 bp from the start codon contained an ABA-responsive element and that the region 579-1,176 bp from the start codon upstream of the exon contained a salt-stress-responsive element. Based on these results, we conclude that the key part of the TaSIP gene is the region of its promoter involved in salt tolerance."
