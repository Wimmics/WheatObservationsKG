"17020806","abstracttext","A 5586 bp sequence (accession no. DQ278491), which includes the RNA polymerase II gene (RPB2) encoding the second largest protein subunit (RPB2), was obtained from the wheat biotype Phaeosphaeria nodorum (PN-w) by PCR amplification. The 3841 bp full length RPB2 gene contains two exons and a 52 bp intron, and encodes a complete 1262 amino acid protein. Similar to the C-terminals of the beta subunits of prokaryotes and yeast RNA polymerases, the deduced RPB2 protein contained many structural features needed for gene transcription. Based on the phylogenetic analysis with the deduced RPB2 polypeptide sequences, the PN-w was closely related to the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus. Size differences were found in the full length RPB2 gene of cereal Phaeosphaeria species, mainly due to differences in intron size. No nucleotide substitutions were found in homothallic P. avenaria f.sp. triticea (Pat1) and barley biotype P. nodorum (PN-b) isolates used in this study. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the RPB2 gene in Pat1 were closely related to that in PN-w."

"20507502","abstracttext","SUMMARY The host-specific toxin ToxA produced by the wheat pathogens Pyrenophora tritici-repentis and Phaeosphaeria nodorum interacts with the product of the dominant plant gene Tsn1 to induce necrosis. The ToxA gene is thought to have been acquired by Py. tritici-repentis from Ph. nodorum through a recent horizontal gene transfer event. PCR and sequence analysis indicate that the level of ToxA variation, including gene deletion, in Ph. nodorum (SnToxA) is significantly higher than in Py. tritici-repentis (PtrToxA). We PCR-screened 788 isolates of Ph. nodorum originating from eight geographical regions to infer the pattern of SnToxA deletions. The frequency of deletions differed significantly among populations, ranging from 0% (Australia) to 98% (China). Sequence analysis of the SnToxA gene in 123 Ph. nodorum isolates revealed 13 distinct haplotypes. The distribution and diversity of haplotypes varied significantly among populations. The majority of SnToxA mutations were non-synonymous resulting in changes at the protein level. We applied different models of selection to infer the mode of evolution operating at the ToxA locus. Evidence for positive diversifying selection supports the hypothesis that evolution of the ToxA locus is driven by selection imposed by the host. The distribution of SnToxA alleles and deletions may reflect the distribution of different Tsn1 alleles in the corresponding host populations."
"20521959","articletitle","Validation of a candidate deoxynivalenol-inactivating UDP-glucosyltransferase from barley by heterologous expression in yeast."
"20521959","abstracttext","Resistance to the virulence factor deoxynivalenol (DON) due to formation of DON-3-O-glucoside (D3G) is considered to be an important component of resistance against Fusarium spp. which produce this toxin. Multiple candidate UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) genes from different crop plants that are either induced by Fusarium spp. or differentially expressed in cultivars varying in Fusarium disease resistance have been described. However, UGT are encoded by a very large gene family in plants. The study of candidate plant UGT is highly warranted because of the potential relevance for developing Fusarium-spp.-resistant crops. We tested Arabidopsis thaliana genes closely related to a previously identified DON-glucosyltransferase gene by heterologous expression in yeast and showed that gene products with very high sequence similarity can have pronounced differences in detoxification capabilities. We also tested four candidate barley glucosyltransferases, which are highly DON inducible. Upon heterologous expression of full-length cDNAs, only one gene, HvUGT13248, conferred DON resistance. The conjugate D3G accumulated in the supernatant of DON-treated yeast transformants. We also present evidence that the product of the TaUGT3 gene recently proposed to encode a DON-detoxification enzyme of wheat does not protect yeast against DON."
"20495056","articletitle","The transcription factor StuA regulates central carbon metabolism, mycotoxin production, and effector gene expression in the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum."
"20495056","abstracttext","The Stagonospora nodorum StuA transcription factor gene SnStuA was identified by homology searching in the genome of the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum. Gene expression analysis revealed that SnStuA transcript abundance increased throughout infection and in vitro growth to peak during sporulation. To investigate its role, the gene was deleted by homologous recombination. The growth of the resulting mutants was retarded on glucose compared to the wild-type growth, and the mutants also failed to sporulate. Glutamate as a sole carbon source restored the growth rate defect observed on glucose, although sporulation remained impaired. The SnstuA strains were essentially nonpathogenic, with only minor growth observed around the point of inoculation. The role of SnstuA was investigated using metabolomics, which revealed that this gene's product played a key role in regulating central carbon metabolism, with glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and amino acid synthesis all affected in the mutants. SnStuA was also found to positively regulate the synthesis of the mycotoxin alternariol. Gene expression studies on the recently identified effectors in Stagonospora nodorum found that SnStuA was a positive regulator of SnTox3 but was not required for the expression of ToxA. This study has uncovered a multitude of novel regulatory targets of SnStuA and has highlighted the critical role of this gene product in the pathogenicity of Stagonospora nodorum."
"22614636","articletitle","Gene technology regulation in Australia: a decade of a federal implementation of a statutory legal code in a context of constituent states taking divergent positions."
"22614636","abstracttext","Gene technology is regulated in Australia by the Office of the Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR), a federal government agency with responsibility for managing health and environmental risks of GM organisms under the Gene Technology Act 2000. The OGTR liaises with other national agencies, governments of States and Territories of Australia and local councils. Current national risk management regulation is the result of three decades of experience with oversight of gene technology. A major operational feature of Australian regulation is reliance on Institutional Biosafety Committees (IBCs) located within the regulated institutions. In 2009-2010 the OGTR managed 45 licenses relating to GM crop field trials, and inspected crop trials that included canola, wheat, barley, banana, sugarcane, cotton, Indian mustard and grapevines. States and Territories of Australia make decisions on market related (non-safety) issues, and adopt different political stances with respect to commercialization of GM crops. Some Australian states support environmental release of licensed GM crops (e.g., Queensland), others ban them (Tasmania), while some have re-positioned themselves, after initially opposing commercialization, to currently allowing regulated commercial use (Victoria, Western Australia). Flexibility exhibited by the Australian regulatory system is facilitated by separation of political decision-making in the Gene Technology Ministerial Council away from the OGTR."
"22207334","articletitle","A new BSMV-based vector with modified β molecule allows simultaneous and stable silencing of two genes."
"22207334","abstracttext","Virus-induced gene silencing is an important tool for functional gene analysis and the vector based on Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) is widely used for the purpose in monocots. Of the tripartite BSMV genome, currently the BSMV:γMCS molecule is used to clone a fragment of a target gene. As an alternative, the BSMV:β molecule was engineered with a unique BamHI site between the open reading frame of βc (ORF βc) and poly(A). The mixture of RNA particles α, βBamHI and γMCS was fully infectious. Barley phytoene desaturase and wheat phospholipase Dα fragments were cloned to βBamHI and γMCS. Delivery of the target gene fragment in γMCS induced stronger silencing, while delivery in βBamHI yielded more stable transcript reduction. A quantitative analysis (qRT-PCR) of the transcripts showed that the silencing induced with a fragment carried in both particles was stronger and more stable than that from a fragment placed in one particle. The modification of β enables simultaneous silencing of two genes. Quantifying the β and γ particles in virus-inoculated plants revealed a 2.5-fold higher level of γ than β, while the stability of the insert was higher in β compared with γ. The possible influence of the relative quantity of β and γ particles in virus-inoculated plants on insert stability and gene silencing efficiency is discussed."
"24130698","articletitle","Large-scale collection and analysis of full-length cDNAs from Brachypodium distachyon and integration with Pooideae sequence resources."
"24130698","abstracttext","A comprehensive collection of full-length cDNAs is essential for correct structural gene annotation and functional analyses of genes. We constructed a mixed full-length cDNA library from 21 different tissues of Brachypodium distachyon Bd21, and obtained 78,163 high quality expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from both ends of ca. 40,000 clones (including 16,079 contigs). We updated gene structure annotations of Brachypodium genes based on full-length cDNA sequences in comparison with the latest publicly available annotations. About 10,000 non-redundant gene models were supported by full-length cDNAs; ca. 6,000 showed some transcription unit modifications. We also found ca. 580 novel gene models, including 362 newly identified in Bd21. Using the updated transcription start sites, we searched a total of 580 plant cis-motifs in the -3 kb promoter regions and determined a genome-wide Brachypodium promoter architecture. Furthermore, we integrated the Brachypodium full-length cDNAs and updated gene structures with available sequence resources in wheat and barley in a web-accessible database, the RIKEN Brachypodium FL cDNA database. The database represents a ""one-stop"" information resource for all genomic information in the Pooideae, facilitating functional analysis of genes in this model grass plant and seamless knowledge transfer to the Triticeae crops."
"24166542","articletitle","Seven members of the (1→3)-β-glucanase gene family in barley (Hordeum vulgare) are clustered on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3HL)."
"24166542","abstracttext","Members of the (1→3)-β-glucan glucanohydrolase (EC 3.2.1.39) gene family have been mapped on the barley genome using three doubled haploid populations and seven wheat-barley addition lines. Specific probes or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were generated for the seven barley (1→3)-β-glucanase genes for which cDNA or genomic clones are currently available. The seven genes are all located on the long arm of chromosome 3 (3HL), and genes encoding isoenzymes GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV and GVII (ABG2) are clustered in a region less than 20 cM in length. The region is flanked by the RFLP marker MWG2099 on the proximal side and the Barley Yellow Mosaic Virus (BYMV) resistance gene ym4 at the distal end. The gene encoding isoenzyme GVI lies approximately 50 cM outside this cluster, towards the centromere. With the exception of the gene encoding isoenzyme GIV, all of the (1→3)-β-glucanase genes are represented by single copies on the barley genome. The probe for the isoenzyme GIV gene hybridized with four DNA bands during Southern blot analysis, only one of which could be incorporated into the consensus linkage map."
"24953133","articletitle","Reliable reference gene selection for Cordyceps militaris gene expression studies under different developmental stages and media."
"24953133","abstracttext","Cordyceps militaris is considered a model organism for the study of Cordyceps species, which are highly prized in traditional Chinese medicine. Gene expression analysis has become more popular and important in studies of this fungus. Reference gene validation under different experimental conditions is crucial for RT-qPCR analysis. In this study, eight candidate reference genes, actin, cox5, gpd, rpb1, tef1, try, tub, and ubi, were selected and their expression stability was evaluated in C. militaris samples using four algorithms, genorm, normfinder, bestkeeper, and the comparative ∆Ct method. Three sets of samples, five different developmental stages cultured in wheat medium and pupae, and all the samples pool were included. The results showed that rpb1 was the best reference gene during all developmental stages examined, while the most common reference genes, actin and tub, were not suitable internal controls. Cox5 also performed poorly and was less stable in our analysis. The ranks of ubi and gpd were inconsistent in different sample sets by different methods. Our results provide guidelines for reference gene selection at different developmental stages and also represent a foundation for more accurate and widespread use of RT-qPCR in C. militaris gene expression analysis."
"28725946","articletitle","Validation and characterization of a QTL for adult plant resistance to stripe rust on wheat chromosome arm 6BS (Yr78)."
"28725946","abstracttext_key message","This study validated one QTL for adult plant resistance to stripe rust, identified donor lines of the resistance allele, and demonstrated that it is different from previously named Yr genes. The spread of more virulent and aggressive races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst, causal pathogen of stripe rust) after the year 2000 has caused substantial yield losses worldwide. To find new sources of resistance, we previously performed a genome-wide association study and identified a strong QTL for adult plant resistance on the short arm of chromosome 6B (QYr.ucw-6B). In this study, we validated QYr.ucw-6B in ten biparental populations, and mapped it 0.6 cM proximal to IWA7257 and 3.9 cM distal to IWA4408. We showed that QYr.ucw-6B is located approximately 15 cM proximal to the all-stage resistance gene Yr35 and that none of the resistant lines carries the previously cloned Yr36 gene. Based on these results, QYr.ucw-6B was assigned the name Yr78. This gene was not effective against Pst at the seedling stage, suggesting that it is an adult plant resistance gene. Yr78 has been effective against Pst races present in field experiments performed in the Western USA between 2011 and 2016. Since this gene is predicted to be present at low frequency in wheat germplasm from this region, it can provide a useful tool to diversify the sources of resistance against this devastating pathogen."
"27550207","articletitle","Comparative Analysis of Deoxynivalenol Biosynthesis Related Gene Expression among Different Chemotypes of Fusarium graminearum in Spring Wheat."
"27550207","abstracttext","Fusarium mycotoxins, deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV) act as virulence factors and are essential for symptom development after initial infection in wheat. To date, 16 genes have been identified in the DON biosynthesis pathway. However, a comparative gene expression analysis in different chemotypes of Fusarium graminearum in response to Fusarium head blight infection remains to be explored. Therefore, in this study, nine genes that involved in trichothecene biosynthesis were analyzed among 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) and nivalenol producing F. graminearum strains in a time course study. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction revealed that the expression of all examined TRI gene transcripts initiated at 2 days post-inoculation (dpi), peaked at three to four dpi and gradually decreased at seven dpi. The early induction of TRI genes indicates that presence of high levels of TRI gene transcripts at early stages is important to initiate the biosynthetic pathway of DON and NIV. Comparison of gene expression among the three chemotypes showed that relative expression of TRI genes was higher in 3-ADON producing strains compared with 15-ADON and NIV strains. Comparatively higher levels of gene expression may contribute to the higher levels of DON produced by 3-ADON strains in infected grains."
"29453934","articletitle","Distinct domains of the AVRPM3 A2/F2 avirulence protein from wheat powdery mildew are involved in immune receptor recognition and putative effector function."
"29453934","abstracttext","Recognition of the AVRPM3 A2/F2 avirulence protein from powdery mildew by the wheat PM3A/F immune receptor induces a hypersensitive response after co-expression in Nicotiana benthamiana. The molecular determinants of this interaction and how they shape natural AvrPm3 a2/f2 allelic diversity are unknown. We sequenced the AvrPm3 a2/f2 gene in a worldwide collection of 272 mildew isolates. Using the natural polymorphisms of AvrPm3 a2/f2 as well as sequence information from related gene family members, we tested 85 single-residue-altered AVRPM3 A2/F2 variants with PM3A, PM3F and PM3F L 456P/Y458H (modified for improved signaling) in Nicotiana benthamiana for effects on recognition. An intact AvrPm3 a2/f2 gene was found in all analyzed isolates and the protein variant recognized by PM3A/F occurred globally at high frequencies. Single-residue alterations in AVRPM3 A2/F2 mostly disrupted, but occasionally enhanced, the recognition response by PM3A, PM3F and PM3F L 456P/Y458H . Residues enhancing hypersensitive responses constituted a protein domain separate from both naturally occurring polymorphisms and positively selected residues of the gene family. These results demonstrate the utility of using gene family sequence diversity to screen residues for their role in recognition. This approach identified a putative interaction surface in AVRPM3 A2/F2 not polymorphic in natural alleles. We conclude that molecular mechanisms besides recognition drive AvrPm3 a2/f2 diversification."
"32172770","articletitle","Promoter of the wheat lipid transfer protein, TdLTP4, drives leaf-preferential expression in transgenic Arabidopsis plants."
"32172770","abstracttext","In a previous report, a gene encoding a durum wheat lipid transfer protein, TdLTP4, was characterised as induced by abiotic and biotic stresses. In the present work, we investigated the regulation of the gene TdLTP4. A TdLTP4 promoter (PrTdLTP4) region of around 868-bp was isolated and sequenced. Its analysis revealed the presence of several DNA boxes known to be important mainly in the regulation of genes expressed under abiotic stress (salt and dehydration), abscisic acid (ABA) and pathogen responsiveness. The whole PrTdLTP4 fragment was fused to the reporter gene β-glucuronidase (gusA) and analysed in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Histochemical assays of transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed that the 868-bp fragment of TdLTP4 gene promoter was found to be sufficient for both spatial and temporal patterns of its expression. Under control conditions, GUS histochemical staining was observed significantly only in young leaves of 8- and 12-day-old plants. Whereas after stress challenge especially with NaCl and mannitol, GUS transcripts expression increased substantially in leaves of 30-day-old transgenic seedlings. Real-time qPCR expression analysis of the gusA gene, confirmed the results of histochemical assays. Taken together these data provide evidence that PrTdLTP4 functions as abiotic-stress-inducible promoter in a heterologous dicot system and could be an excellent tool for future crop improvement."
"32654288","articletitle","High mass resolution, spatial metabolite mapping enhances the current plant gene and pathway discovery toolbox."
"32654288","abstracttext","Understanding when and where metabolites accumulate provides important cues to the gene function. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables in situ temporal and spatial measurement of a large assortment of metabolites, providing mapping information regarding their cellular distribution. To describe the current state and technical advances using MSI in plant sciences, we employed MSI to demonstrate its significant contribution to the study of plant specialised metabolism. We show that coupling MSI with: (1) RNA interference (RNAi), (2) virus induced gene silencing (VIGS), (3) agroinfiltration or (4) samples derived from plant natural variation provides great opportunities to understand the accurate gene-metabolite relationship and discover novel gene-associated metabolites. This was exemplified in three plant species (i.e. tomato, tobacco and wheat) by mapping the distribution of metabolites possessing a range of polarities. In particular, we demonstrated that MSI is able to spatially map an entire metabolic pathway, including intermediates and final products, in the intricate biosynthetic route to tomato fruit steroidal glycoalkaloids. We therefore envisage MSI as a key component of the metabolome analysis arsenal employed in plant gene discovery strategies."
"30648548","articletitle","Enhanced protoplast assay by transfecting PCR-assembled gene expression cassettes with telomeric repeats and thiophosphate modifications."
"30648548","abstracttext","Transient expression assays are invaluable complements to the stable transgenic assay for studying gene functions by providing desirable time and labor efficiencies and high-throughput potential or circumventing technical difficulties of stable transgenic expression. The protoplast transient expression system is one of the mainstream transient expression assays used in plant research. Here, we developed a PCR amplicon-mediated protoplast transient (PROMPT) assay by using overlapping PCR assembled gene expression cassettes for Arabidopsis protoplast transfection without the need for time- and labor-consuming plasmid construction. When 200 μl of Arabidopsis protoplasts were transfected with 1 μg of PCR amplicons or plasmid DNA, we detected substantially higher gene expression in the former. Moreover, we found that adding telomeric repeats and thiophosphate modifications to the 5' end of the nonsense strand through the reverse primer could further increase the PCR amplicon-mediated gene expression in protoplasts. Importantly, these improvements could also be applied to the protoplast assays in other dicot and monocot species including tobacco, rice and wheat. In addition, the subcellular localization of immune receptor FLS2 could be analyzed by PROMPT method. The PROMPT assay allows an accelerated and robust transient gene expression in protoplasts from diverse plant species."
"11550898","articletitle","Candidate-gene cloning and targeted marker enrichment of wheat chromosomal regions using RNA fingerprinting-differential display."
"11550898","abstracttext","The usefulness of the RNA fingerprinting-differential display technique in gene cloning and targeted marker enrichment in wheat is demonstrated. A small region of chromosome 5BL was targeted that contains Ph1, a chromosome-pairing regulator gene. The cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) and mutant ph1b are almost identical except for chromosome 5BL, which, in the mutant line, carries an interstitial deletion encompassing the Ph1 gene. Poly(A)+ RNA of the two lines from anthers at developmental stages ranging from pre-meiotic mitosis to anaphase II was PCR-amplified using 38 pairwise combinations of 19 primers. The 35S-labeled amplified products were size-separated on denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gels. A total of 3154 fragment bands were observed, of which 43 were present in CS but absent in the ph1b mutant. These 43 fragment bands were eluted, re-amplified, and used as probes in gel-blot DNA analyses of wheat group 5 nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and the ph1b mutant. Twenty-four of these 43 probes were single- or few-copy sequences. Eight of the 24 probes mapped to wheat group 5 and five mapped to the deletion of the ph1b mutant. Three of these five probes were further localized to the submicroscopic region containing the Ph1 gene, by using two deletion lines flanking the region. Northern-blot analysis revealed that the gene corresponding to one of these three probes expresses mainly during meiosis and is from the B genome."
"15668223","articletitle","Regulation by Vrn-1/Fr-1 chromosomal intervals of CBF-mediated Cor/Lea gene expression and freezing tolerance in common wheat."
"15668223","abstracttext","Vrn-1/Fr-1 chromosomal regions of common wheat possess major QTLs for both winter hardiness (Fr) and vernalization requirement (Vrn). The Vrn-1/Fr-1 intervals are assigned to long arms of the homologous group 5 chromosomes. To investigate the role of the Vrn-1/Fr-1 intervals on the low-temperature (LT) inducibility of wheat Cor/Lea genes and its putative transcription factor gene Wcbf2, LT response of these genes was monitored using near-isogenic lines (NILs) for the Vrn-1 loci. The Wcbf2 transcript accumulated rapidly after LT treatment and remained at a high level in lines without any dominant Vrn-1 alleles. By contrast, the Wcbf2 transcript level was greatly reduced in lines carrying the Vrn-1 alleles. The Vrn-1 NILs accumulated much lower amounts of Cor/Lea transcripts and COR/LEA proteins than the non-carrier line. The observed patterns and levels of gene expression, particularly in the Vrn-A1 NIL, agreed with the higher sensitivity to freezing damage in this line than in the non-carrier line. Up-regulation of the expression of the WAP1 gene, a candidate of the Vrn-1 loci, was much delayed in the non-carrier line than all the NILs carrying the Vrn-1 loci. Neither positive nor negative relationships were found between the WAP1 expression and the Cbf2/Cor/Lea expression. These results support the intimate relationship between the Cbf2/Cor/Lea expression and the level of freezing tolerance, and suggest that a functional Fr-A1 allele linked to the vrn-A1 allele, instead of the vernalization gene itself, plays a major role in regulating the CBF-mediated Cor/lea gene expression in wheat."
"12734655","articletitle","Mapping genes affecting flowering time and frost resistance on chromosome 5B of wheat."
"12734655","abstracttext","Two populations of single chromosome recombinant lines were used to map genes controlling flowering time on chromosome 5B of wheat, and one of the populations was also used to map a new frost resistance gene. Genetic maps were developed, mainly using microsatellite markers, and QTL analysis was applied to phenotypic data on the performance of each population collected from growth-room tests of flowering time and frost tolerance. Using a recombinant substitution-line mapping population derived from a cross between the substitution-line 'Chinese Spring' ('Cheyenne' 5B) and 'Chinese Spring' (CS), the gene Vrn-B1, affecting vernalization response, an earliness per se locus, Eps-5BL1, and a gene, Fr-B1, affecting frost resistance, were mapped. Using a 'Hobbit Sib' ('Chinese Spring' 5BL) x 'Hobbit Sib' recombinant substitution line mapping population, an earliness per se locus, Eps-5BL2 was mapped. The Vrn-B1 locus was mapped on the distal portion of the long arm of chromosome 5B, to a region syntenous with the segments of chromosomes 5A and 5D containing Vrn-A1 and Vrn-D1 loci, respectively. The two Eps-5BL loci were mapped close to the centromere with a 16-cM distance from each other, one in agreement with the position of a homoeologous locus previously mapped on chromosome 5H of barley, and suggested by the response of 'Chinese Spring' deletion lines. The Fr-B1 gene was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5B, 40 cM from the centromeric marker. Previous comparative mapping data with rice chromosome 9 would suggest that this gene could be orthologous to the other Fr genes mapped previously by us on chromosomes 5A or 5D of wheat, although in a more proximal position. This study completes the mapping of these homoeoallelic series of vernalization requirement genes and frost resistance genes on the chromosomes of the homoeologous group 5 in wheat."
"15741662","articletitle","Resistance of cultivars and breeding lines of spring wheat to Fusarium culmorum and powdery mildew."
"15741662","abstracttext","Twelve Polish spring wheat cultivars and 18 spring wheat accessions from CIMMYT, Mexico, were examined for resistance to a highly pathogenic Fusarium culmorum strain KF846 and powdery mildew in 5-year field experiments. Resistant wheat cultivars (Sumai 3 and Frontana) served as controls. The mean percentage of Fusarium-damaged kernels (% FDK) for 5 years was lower in CIMMYT accessions (16.7%) than in Polish spring cultivars (28.3%). In all Polish spring cultivars, % FDK was higher than in the control cultivars Sumai 3 and Frontana (12-20%). The mean disease score (on a scale of 1-9) for powdery mildew (natural infection) for all examined cultivars and lines ranged from 0 to 7 and in the Polish spring cultivars was significantly lower (0-5). Cultivars Eta, Henika, Ismena, Jasna and Olimpia were found to be the least susceptible to powdery mildew in field experiments. The laboratory host-pathogen tests with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates showed that only two cultivars were characterized by identical resistance patterns as the standard differential lines with documented resistance genes. Cultivar Alkora had the gene Pm3d, and Henika had Pm5. The gene Pm3d was identified in cultivars Jasna and Eta in combination with another unknown gene/genes. Cultivars Santa and Torka had the gene Pm5 in combination with another unknown gene/genes. Four cultivars: Banti, Ismena, Olimpia and Sigma, showed resistance to all mildew isolates employed in a laboratory test. The accession IPG-SW-14 was the least susceptible to both pathogens (F. culmorum and powdery mildew) in all 5 years of experiments. This line is the best candidate for deriving new cultivars with improved resistance to fungal diseases."
"16972061","articletitle","H22, a major resistance gene to the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), is mapped to the distal region of wheat chromosome 1DS."
"16972061","abstracttext","H22 is a major resistance gene conferring high-level of antibiosis to Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] larvae. It was previously assigned to wheat chromosome 1D through monosomic analysis (Raupp et al. in J Hered 84:142-145, 1993). The objective of this study was to identify molecular markers that can be used for marker-assisted selection for wheat breeding, and to further map this gene toward map-based cloning. Forty-five simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers specific to chromosome 1D were evaluated for linkage to H22 using a segregating population consisting of 192 F(2:3) families, which were derived from the cross Tugela-Dn1 x KS85WGRC01(H22). The STS Xhor2kv and SSR Xgdm33 are two flanking markers that are tightly linked to H22 at genetic distances of 0.3 and 1.0 cM, respectively. Five other SSR markers including Xgpw7082, Xwmc147, Xcfd15, Xwmc432 and Xwmc336 were also linked to H22 at the distance from 0.8 to 20.8 cM. Analysis of Chinese Spring (CS) deletion lines revealed that all the H22-linked markers are located distal to the breakpoint of del 1DS-5, indicating that the H22 gene is located at the distal 30% region on the short arm of wheat chromosome 1D. Genomic comparison suggested that the H22 gene is located in the same or similar chromosomal region as the leaf rust resistance genes Lr21 and Lr40 on 1DS, and orthologous to the H9 gene cluster of 1AS."
"17437064","articletitle","Regulatory gene candidates and gene expression analysis of cold acclimation in winter and spring wheat."
"17437064","abstracttext","Freezing tolerance in plants develops through acclimation to cold by growth at low, above-freezing temperatures. Wheat is one of the most freezing-tolerant plants among major crop species and the wide range of freezing tolerance among wheat cultivars makes it an excellent model for investigation of the genetic basis of cold tolerance. Large numbers of genes are known to have altered levels of expression during the period of cold acclimation and there is keen interest in deciphering the signaling and regulatory pathways that control the changes in gene expression associated with acquired freezing tolerance. A 5740 feature cDNA amplicon microarray that was enriched for signal transduction and regulatory genes was constructed to compare changes in gene expression in a highly cold-tolerant winter wheat cultivar CDC Clair and a less tolerant spring cultivar, Quantum. Changes in gene expression over a time course of 14 days detected over 450 genes that were regulated by cold treatment and were differentially regulated between spring and winter cultivars, of these 130 are signaling or regulatory gene candidates, including: transcription factors, protein kinases, ubiquitin ligases and GTP, RNA and calcium binding proteins. Dynamic changes in transcript levels were seen at all periods of cold acclimation in both cultivars. There was an initial burst of gene activity detectable during the first day of CA, during which 90% of all genes with increases in transcript levels became clearly detectable and early expression differential between the two cultivars became more disparate with each successive period of cold acclimation."
"18503501","articletitle","Comparison of promoters in transgenic rice."
"18503501","abstracttext_summary","Reports of the use of rice storage protein gene promoters to express transgenes in rice grain have demonstrated that rice grain can be used as a production platform for end-use quality or seed-based edible vaccines. The generation of transgenic rice with multitraits (gene stacking), which requires the use of multiple transgenes under the control of different promoters, necessitates the use of promoters from rice and other cereals, as this is highly advantageous in reducing homology-based transcriptional gene silencing. Using the green fluorescent protein gene (gfp) as a reporter gene and a transgenic rice platform, promoters of storage protein and non-storage protein genes from barley, wheat and rice were compared with regard to their spatial and temporal control of expression. Storage protein promoters from barley (549-bp B-hordein and 433-bp D-hordein) and wheat (425-bp high-molecular-weight glutenin) directed the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in endosperm but not embryo; however, expression was leaky, as it was also observed in seed maternal tissues, leaf and root tissues. As expected, the rice promoters (1350-bp alpha-glutelin B-1 and 1007-bp alpha-globulin) directed the endosperm-specific expression of GFP in transgenic rice. Our results indicate that seed-specific promoters from barley and wheat, although containing endosperm and GCN4 motifs, which are important for endosperm-specific expression in rice, may not be spatially regulated in the same manner as they are in their native species. The analysis of GFP expression under the control of various promoters in rice grain indicates that promoters from other cereals can drive high levels of endosperm-specific expression in rice, but their utility for seed-specific expression may depend on their tissue specificity."

"20012664","abstracttext","Wheat seed storage protein gene loci (Glu-3) and powdery mildew resistance gene loci (Pm3 and Pm3-like) are closely linked on the short arms of homoeologous group 1 chromosomes. To study the structural organization of the Glu-3/Pm3 loci, three bacterial artificial chromosome clones were sequenced from the A, B, and D genomes of hexaploid wheat. The A and B genome clones contained a Glu-3 adjacent to a Pm3-like gene organized in a conserved Glu-3/SFR159/Pm3-like structure. The D genome clone contained clusters of resistance gene analogs but no Pm3. Its similarity to the A and B genome was limited to the Glu-3/SFR159 region. Comparison of the B genome PM3-like deduced amino acid sequence with known PM3 functional isotypes reinforced the hypothesis of allelic evolution via block exchange by gene conversion/recombination. The advent of glutenin genes and the formation of the Glu-3/SFR159/Pm3 locus occurred after divergence of wheat from rice and Brachypodium. Comparison of the A genome homologous sequences permitted an estimate of time of divergence of approximately 0.3 million years ago. The B genome sequences were not colinear indicating that they could either be paralogs or represent different B genome progenitors. Analysis of the 11 complete retrotransposons indicated a time of divergence ranging from 0.29 to 5.62 million years ago, consistent with their complex nested structure."

"20055652","abstracttext","ABSTRACT One plant genotype displays a resistance phenotype at one development stage but a susceptible reaction to the same pathogen at another stage, which is referred to here as resistance inversion. In wheat, Fusarium head blight (FHB)-resistant cv. Sumai3 showed a Fusarium seedling blight (FSB)-susceptible reaction whereas FHB-susceptible cv. Annong8455 exhibited FSB resistance when challenged with a Fusarium asiaticum strain that produces deoxynivalenol (DON). The resistance to FHB and FSB in wheat was closely associated with expression of a plant cytochrome P450 gene in response to FHB pathogens and mycotoxins. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that expression of nine defense-related genes in spikes and seedlings was induced by the fungal infection, in which a massive accumulation of a plant cytochrome P450 gene, CYP709C1, was clearly associated with the resistance reaction in both seedling and spike. The FHB-resistant Sumai3 accumulated 7-fold more P450 transcripts than did the FHB-susceptible Annong8455, while 84-fold more P450 transcripts were accumulated in the FSB-resistant Annong8455 than the FSB-susceptible Sumai3. A Fusarium strain with a disrupted Tri5 gene, which is not able to produce the first enzyme essential for trichothecene mycotoxin biosynthesis, also induced more P450 transcripts in FHB- and FSB-resistant cultivars. The fungal activation of the P450 gene was more profound in the FSB-resistant reaction than the FHB-resistant reaction relative to their susceptible counterparts. DON triggered a differential expression of the P450 gene with comparable patterns in spikes and seedlings in a resistance-dependent manner. These results may provide a basis for dissecting mechanisms underlying FHB and FSB resistance reactions in wheat and revealing functions of the cytochrome P450 in plant detoxification and defense."

"23564033","abstracttext","The complete set of unique γ-gliadin genes is described for the wheat cultivar Chinese Spring using a combination of expressed sequence tag (EST) and Roche 454 DNA sequences. Assemblies of Chinese Spring ESTs yielded 11 different γ-gliadin gene sequences. Two of the sequences encode identical polypeptides and are assumed to be the result of a recent gene duplication. One gene has a 3' coding mutation that changes the reading frame in the final eight codons. A second assembly of Chinese Spring γ-gliadin sequences was generated using Roche 454 total genomic DNA sequences. The 454 assembly confirmed the same 11 active genes as the EST assembly plus two pseudogenes not represented by ESTs. These 13 γ-gliadin sequences represent the complete unique set of γ-gliadin genes for cv Chinese Spring, although not ruled out are additional genes that are exact duplications of these 13 genes. A comparison with the ESTs of two other hexaploid cultivars (Butte 86 and Recital) finds that the most active genes are present in all three cultivars, with exceptions likely due to too few ESTs for detection in Butte 86 and Recital. A comparison of the numbers of ESTs per gene indicates differential levels of expression within the γ-gliadin gene family. Genome assignments were made for 6 of the 13 Chinese Spring γ-gliadin genes, i.e., one assignment from a match to two γ-gliadin genes found within a tetraploid wheat A genome BAC and four genes that match four distinct γ-gliadin sequences assembled from Roche 454 sequences from Aegilops tauschii, the hexaploid wheat D-genome ancestor."

"22145589","abstracttext","The wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum, causal organism of the wheat disease Stagonospora nodorum blotch, has emerged as a model for the Dothideomycetes, a large fungal taxon that includes many important plant pathogens. The initial annotation of the genome assembly included 16,586 nuclear gene models. These gene models were used to design a microarray that has been interrogated with labelled transcripts from six cDNA samples: four from infected wheat plants at time points spanning early infection to sporulation, and two time points taken from growth in artificial media. Positive signals of expression were obtained for 12,281 genes. This represents strong corroborative evidence of the validity of these gene models. Significantly differential expression between the various time points was observed. When infected samples were compared with axenic cultures, 2882 genes were expressed at a higher level in planta and 3630 were expressed more highly in vitro. Similar numbers were differentially expressed between different developmental stages. The earliest time points in planta were particularly enriched in differentially expressed genes. A disproportionate number of the early expressed gene products were predicted to be secreted, but otherwise had no obvious sequence homology to functionally characterized genes. These genes are candidate necrotrophic effectors. We have focused attention on genes for carbohydrate metabolism and the specific biosynthetic pathways active during growth in planta. The analysis points to a very dynamic adjustment of metabolism during infection. Functional analysis of a gene in the coenzyme A biosynthetic pathway showed that the enzyme was dispensable for growth, indicating that a precursor is supplied by the plant."

"24416331","abstracttext","In comparison to dicot-infecting bacteria, only limited numbers of genome sequences are available for monocot-infecting and in particular cereal-infecting bacteria. Herein we report the characterisation and genome sequence of Xanthomonas translucens isolate DAR61454 pathogenic on wheat and barley. Based on phylogenetic analysis of the ATP synthase beta subunit (atpD) gene, DAR61454 is most closely related to other X. translucens strains and the sugarcane- and banana- infecting Xanthomonas strains, but shares a type III secretion system (T3SS) with X. translucens pv. graminis and more distantly related xanthomonads. Assays with an adenylate cyclase reporter protein demonstrate that DAR61454's T3SS is functional in delivering proteins to wheat cells. X. translucens DAR61454 also encodes two type VI secretion systems with one most closely related to those found in some strains of the rice infecting strain X. oryzae pv. oryzae but not other xanthomonads. Comparative analysis of 18 different Xanthomonas isolates revealed 84 proteins unique to cereal (i.e. rice) infecting isolates and the wheat/barley infecting DAR61454. Genes encoding 60 of these proteins are found in gene clusters in the X. translucens DAR61454 genome, suggesting cereal-specific pathogenicity islands. However, none of the cereal pathogen specific proteins were homologous to known Xanthomonas spp. effectors. Comparative analysis outside of the bacterial kingdom revealed a nucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase encoding gene in DAR61454 also present in other bacteria as well as a number of pathogenic Fusarium species, suggesting that this gene may have been transmitted horizontally from bacteria to the Fusarium lineage of pathogenic fungi. This example further highlights the importance of horizontal gene acquisition from bacteria in the evolution of fungi."
"27222818","articletitle","Nucleotide polymorphisms and protein structure changes in the Fg16 gene of Fusarium graminearum sensu stricto."
"27222818","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is one of the most important causes of wheat scab in different parts of the world. This fungus is able to produce widespread trichothecene mycotoxins such as nivalenol (NIV) and deoxynivalenol (DON) which are harmful for both human and animals. The Fg16 target is located in chromosome 1 of the F. graminearum genome coding for a hypothetical protein whose function is not yet known. The Fg16 gene is involved in lipid biosynthesis and leads to sexual development during colonization in wheat stalks. This gene is used to detect F. graminearum and determine the lineage of F. graminearum complex species. In the present study, polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) and DNA sequencing methods were employed in screening for genetic variation in 172 F. graminearum s.s. isolates. The PCR reaction forced the amplification of 410-bp fragments of Fg16. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (T82C and A352T) and one amino acid exchange (C65S) with three patterns (TA/TA, CT/CT and TA/CT genotypes) were found in the Fg16 gene fragment. Two haplotypes, 1A and 1B, were identified within F. graminearum s.s. populations in northern and western regions of Iran. Two different secondary structures of protein were predicted for CT/CT and TA/CT genotypes of Fg16 gene. The average diversity levels detected were relatively high (He: 0.3238; Heu: 0.334; Ho: 0.2894; mean PIC: 0.514; mean Shannon's information index: 0.4132; mean number of alleles per locus: 1.473). On the basis of the obtained results, it was revealed that the Fg16 gene had a high degree of polymorphism that can be considered for future control programming strategies and thus the associations between the SSCP patterns with different traits of F. graminearum such as wheat colonization, perithecium formation on stalk tissues and lineage discrimination should be investigated."

"28876207","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the wheat stripe rust pathogen, is a dikaryotic, biotrophic, and macrocyclic fungus. Genetic study of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici virulence was not possible until the recent discovery of Berberis spp. and Mahonia spp. as alternate hosts. To determine inheritance of virulence and map virulence genes, a segregating population of 119 isolates was developed by self-fertilizing P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolate 08-220 (race PSTv-11) on barberry leaves under controlled greenhouse conditions. The progeny isolates were phenotyped on a set of 29 wheat lines with single genes for race-specific resistance and genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from secreted protein genes, and SNP markers from genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). Using the GBS technique, 10,163 polymorphic GBS-SNP markers were identified. Clustering and principal component analysis grouped these markers into six genetic groups, and a genetic map, consisting of six linkage groups, was constructed with 805 markers. The six clusters or linkage groups resulting from these analyses indicated a haploid chromosome number of six in P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. Through virulence testing of the progeny isolates, the parental isolate was found to be homozygous for the avirulence loci corresponding to resistance genes Yr5, Yr10, Yr15, Yr24, Yr32, YrSP, YrTr1, Yr45, and Yr53 and homozygous for the virulence locus corresponding to resistance gene Yr41. Segregation was observed for virulence phenotypes in response to the remaining 19 single-gene lines. A single dominant gene or two dominant genes with different nonallelic gene interactions were identified for each of the segregating virulence phenotypes. Of 27 dominant virulence genes identified, 17 were mapped to two chromosomes. Markers tightly linked to some of the virulence loci may facilitate further studies to clone these genes. The virulence genes and their inheritance information are useful for understanding the host-pathogen interactions and for selecting effective resistance genes or gene combinations for developing stripe rust resistant wheat cultivars."

"32617615","abstracttext_key message","The recessive Hessian fly resistance gene h4 and flanking SNP markers were located to a 642 kb region in chromosome 1A of the wheat cultivar 'Java.' Hessian fly (HF), Mayetiola destructor, is one of the most destructive insect pests in wheat worldwide. The wheat cultivar 'Java' was reported to carry a recessive gene (h4) for HF resistance; however, its chromosome location has not been determined. To map the HF resistance gene in Java, two populations of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from 'Bobwhite' × Java and 'Overley' × Java, respectively, and were phenotyped for responses to infestation of HF Great Plains biotype. Analysis of phenotypic data from the F 1 and the RIL populations confirmed that one recessive gene conditioned HF resistance in Java. Two linkage maps were constructed using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers generated by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS). The h4 gene was mapped to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 1A, which explained 60.4 to 70.5% of the phenotypic variation for HF resistance in the two populations. The GBS-SNPs in the h4 candidate interval were converted into Kompetitive Allele-Specific Polymerase Chain Reaction (KASP) markers to eliminate the missing data points in GBS-SNPs. Using the revised maps with KASP markers, h4 was further located to a 642 kb interval (6,635,984-7,277,935 bp). The two flanking KASP markers, KASP3299 and KASP1871, as well as four other closely linked KASP markers, may be useful for pyramiding h4 with other HF resistance genes in breeding."

"1718614","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequences of the tRNASer (trnS), pseudo-tRNA, NADH dehydrogenase subunit 3 (nad3), and ribosomal protein S12 (rps12) genes from rice mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) were determined. Both trnS and nad3 were confirmed to be single copy genes by Southern blot analysis. The nad3 and rps12 genes were arranged in tandem, and the two were co-transcribed. The order of the above four genes in rice mtDNA differed from the linear order observed for the wheat and maize genes. In rice mitochondria, the trnS and pseudo-tRNA genes were found upstream of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, instead of the nad3 and rps12 genes as observed in maize and wheat. Additionally, while the rice nad3 and rps12 genes remain paired, they too are in a different sequence environment from the wheat and maize genes. The apparent split of the two pairs of genes indicates the occurrence of a mitochondrial intramolecular recombinational event. Another peculiarity is that the sequence upstream of the translational initiation codon of the rice nad3 gene is different from that of the wheat and maize versions. The ATG initiation codon of wheat and maize nad3 is replaced by TTG in the rice nad3. A subsequent deduction of the amino acid sequence, accompanied by a primer extension analysis, indicates that the predicted rice NAD3 protein has an additional 37 amino acid residues at its N-terminus compared to the wheat and maize NAD3 proteins. cDNA sequence analysis showed no introns or the occurrence of RNA editing at the newly replaced TTG codon."

"12627384","abstracttext","To explore the relationship between fine chromosome deletion and protein expression in common wheat, the changes in protein composition of wheat seed proteome were investigated by using chromosome 1B. A momosomic alien chromosome addition line of common wheat was used to produce the fine deletion lines. Endosperm and embryo proteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and visualized by staining with Commassie Brilliant Blue, and gel images were analyzed with a computer assisted image analyzer. For the first time, fine gene locations of a few endosperm and embryo proteins were identified on the chromosome 1B. These proteins with their specific gene location on the chromosome can be used as protein markers in breeding programs for quality of wheat proteins. To identify wheat seed proteins and to understand their expression in relation to chromosome deletion, the feasibility of a new analytical approach based on isotope coded affinity tag labeling (ICAT) of peptides in tryptic digests followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry has been described. Simplification of the complex tryptic digest prior to mass spectral analysis was performed by treating the samples with light and heavy ICAT labeling reagents. A clear separation of peptide fragment containing the light and heavy reagents was achieved in mass spectral analysis. Out of the 14 peptides detected by mass fragment analysis of the euploid, four were down-regulated, nine up-regulated and one did not show any change due to the terminal deletion of chromosome 1B. Selected peptide fragments were subjected to tandem mass spectrometry analysis for sequence information and the resulting sequence information was submitted to databases for protein identification. Of the five proteins submitted, four were identified as alpha-amylase inhibitor, alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor precursor, proteasome subunit alpha-type 7 and 1,4 alpha-glucan-D-maltohydrolase. With this approach it is possible to identify wheat seed proteins and to understand their expression, which have been reported to be difficult by 2-DE due to cosynthesis of proteins by genes from three genomes, A, B and D."

"15907686","abstracttext","Sodium at high millimolar levels in the cytoplasm is toxic to plant and yeast cells. Sequestration of Na+ ions into the vacuole through the action of tonoplast proton pumps (an H+ -ATPase in the case of yeast, and either a H+ -pyrophosphatase (H+ -PPase) or H+ -ATPase in the case of plants) and a Na+/H+ antiporter is one mechanism that confers salt tolerance to these organisms. The cloning and characterization of genes encoding these tonoplast transport proteins from crop plants may contribute to our understanding of how to enhance crop plant response to saline stress. We cloned wheat orthologs of the Arabidopsis genes AtNHX1 and AVP1 using the polymerase chain reaction and primers corresponding to conserved regions of the respective coding sequences, and a wheat cDNA library as template. The wheat NHX cDNA cloned by this approach was a variant of the previously reported TNHX1 gene. The vacuolar H+ -PPase pump we cloned (TVP1) is the first member of this gene family cloned from wheat; it is deduced translation product is homologous to proteins encoded by genes in barley, rice, and Arabidopsis. Function of TNHX1 as a cation/proton antiporter was demonstrated using the nhx1 yeast mutant. TNHX1 was capable of suppressing the hyg sensitivity of nhx1. Functional characterization of the wheat H+ -PPase TVP1 was demonstrated using the yeast ena1 (plasma membrane Na+ -efflux transporter) mutant. Expression of TVP1 in ena1 suppressed its Na+ hypersensitivity. Expression analysis of salt-stressed wheat plants showed substantial up-regulation of TNHX1 transcript levels as compared to control plants, while transcript accumulation for TVP1 was not greatly affected by exposure of plants to salt stress."

Gby is a new greenbug resistance gene in the wheat line 'Sando's selection 4040'. A mapping population used in this study was derived from a cross of Sando's 4040 and PI220127, a greenbug susceptible wheat land race from Afghanistan. A progeny test indicated that Gby is inherited as a single semi-dominant gene. A genetic linkage map consisting of Gby, Xgwm322 (a wheat microsatellite marker), XksuD2 (an STS marker) and 18 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci was constructed. We used DNA from Chinese Spring 7A deletion lines to show that the gwm332 and ksuD2 amplified fragments mapped in this study are located on along arm of chromosome 7A. This suggests that Gby is located on wheat chromosome 7A. Gby was mapped to the area in the middle of the 'island' of putative defense response genes that are represented by RFLP markers(Xpsr l9, XZnfp, Xbcd98 and Prl b) previously mapped to the distal part of the short arm of wheat chromosome group 7. This region of chromosome 7A is characterized by a high recombination rate and a high physical density of markers which makes Gby a very good candidate for map-based cloning. The selection accuracy when theRFLP markers Xbcd98, Xpsrll9 or XZnfp and Prlb flanking Gby are used together to tag Gby is 99.78%,suggesting that they can be successfully used in marker assisted selection."

During the years 1998-2001, wheat fields in Sistan province were surveyed and powdery mildew infected samples were collected from various areas and transferred to the laboratory. In the greenhouse, fungal spores were purified and inoculated onto susceptible wheat cultivars using single pustule and single spore procedures. Selected pure isolates were inoculated onto the first leaves of eight differential wheat varieties for identifying physiological races. The results showed the existence of Bgt races 5, 11, 14, 19, 21, 24, 27, 28, 31, 32, 44, 50, 53, 58, 66, 73 and 84 in Sistan. These races were new to Sistan province and Iran as a whole. Among 17 races studied, races 11, 53 and 73 were important dominant races thus constituting 40% of total population. Race 53 constituted 16% of all isolates and was the dominant race in the area with 62.5% pathogenicity. Therefore, this race was introduced as the most virulent race during the period of this study. This study showed that Bgt isolates were compatible with host plant genes pm8, pm3 and pm3b but incompatible with gene pm4b. Powdery mildew resistance was evaluated using race 11 on 70 wheat cultivars during seedling stage as well as adult plant under both greenhouse and field conditions between 1999 and 2001. Among wheat lines tested for resistance against powdery mildew, cultivar Hirmand resembled the differential line Weihenst M1 in that both may possess gene pm4b and showed no symptoms under the greenhouse and field conditions. Cultivar Chamran was found to be highly resistant whereas Sorkhtokhm was susceptible. Other cutivars showed partial and gradual resistance against the powdery mildew disease."

"19123069","abstracttext","Nitrogen is a crucial macronutrient needed in the greatest amount of all mineral elements required by plants. Development of crop varieties with high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) is imperative for sustainable agriculture. Understanding how plant genes respond to different nitrogen conditions is essential for formulating approaches, for manipulating genes, for improving NUE. In the present study we analyzed the activity of three different enzymes involved in nitrogen assimilation viz., GS, GOGAT and GDH along with physiological parameters like chlorophyll variable yield (Fv/Fmax), photosynthesis rate and total chlorophyll content at four different growth stages of wheat plant development under different nitrogen treatments. For this study two different wheat varieties UP-2644 and Raj-4097 having high and low protein content, respectively in the grains were chosen. Gene expression profile of a Dof transcription factor (TaDof1 of wheat) was also included in the study to assess its role in nitrogen metabolism. Densitometry analysis at S(2) and S(3) stage of wheat spikes of both the wheat varieties grown at different nitrogen treatments showed that TaDof1 expression was up-regulated in low nitrogen treatment. In S(3) stage, in high protein content wheat variety UP-2644, TaDof1 expression was elevated in low and normal nitrogen treatment as compared to high nitrogen treatment. The gene expression profile of Dof 1 was found to coincide with the enzyme activities of GS, GOGAT at the S(3) stage. The activities of these enzymes were prolonged in the high protein content variety. Since, Dof transcription factor(s) have been previously reported to control the expression of genes involved nitrogen assimilation i.e., GS and GOGAT and may be the elevated expression of Dof 1 at the grain filling stage over expresses the GS and GOGAT genes thereby prolonging their activities."

"17712543","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat reduces the quality of wheat grain, and improving PHS tolerance is a priority in certain wheat growing regions where conditions favorable for PHS exist. Two new Viviparous-1 allelic variants related to PHS tolerance were investigated on B genome of bread wheat, and designated as Vp-1Bb and Vp-1Bc, respectively. Sequence analysis showed that Vp-1Bb and Vp-1Bc had an insertion of 193-bp and a deletion of 83-bp fragment, respectively, located in the third intron region of the Vp-1B gene. The insertion and deletion affected the expression level of the Vp1 at mature seed stage, more correctly spliced transcripts were observed from the genotypes with either insertion or deletion than that of the wild type. Based on these insertions and deletions, a co-dominant STS marker of Vp-1B gene was developed and designated as Vp1B3, which in most cases could amplify either 845 or 569-bp fragment from the tolerant cultivars, and 652-bp from the susceptible ones. This Vp1B3 marker was mapped to chromosome 3BL using a set of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines. A total of 89 white-grained Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines, were used to validate the relationship between the polymorphic fragments of Vp1B3 and PHS tolerance. Statistical analysis indicated that Vp1B3 was strongly associated with PHS tolerance in this set of Chinese germplasm, suggesting that Vp1B3 could be used as an efficient and reliable co-dominant marker in the evaluation of wheat germplasm for PHS tolerance and marker-assisted breeding for PHS tolerant cultivars."

"18787805","abstracttext","Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major constraint for wheat production in acidic soils. Wheat producers now routinely use Al-resistant cultivars as one cost-effective means to reduce risks associated with acidic soils. To date, diverse Al-resistant materials have been identified, but their genetic relationship has not been well characterized. A total of 57 wheat accessions, including the majority of the parents of Al-resistant accessions we identified in a previous study, were evaluated for Al resistance and analyzed with 49 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and 4 markers for Al-activated malate transporter (ALMT1). Pedigree and principle coordinate analysis (PCA) both separated Al-resistant accessions into four groups labeled according to common ancestry or geographical origin: US-Fultz, Polyssu, Mexican and Chinese. Al resistance in the four groups may have three independent origins given their distinct geographic origins and gene pools. Fultz originated in the USA as a major ancestor to soft red winter wheat, Polyssu originated in Brazil as a major source of Al resistance used in most genetic studies worldwide, and the Chinese group originated in China. Based on ALMT1 marker haplotypes, the Al resistance in the Polyssu and Mexico groups was likely derived from Polyssu, while most Al-resistant cultivars developed in the USA most likely inherited most of Al resistance from Fultz. Fultz was released about 50 years earlier than Polyssu. Norin 10 likely played a pivotal role in passing Al-resistant gene(s) from Fultz to better adapted, semi-dwarf wheat cultivars developed in the USA.

"18712343","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance was identified in the alien species Leymus racemosus, and wheat-Leymus introgression lines with FHB resistance were reported previously. Detailed molecular cytogenetic analysis of alien introgressions T01, T09, and T14 and the mapping of Fhb3, a new gene for FHB resistance, are reported here. The introgression line T09 had an unknown wheat-Leymus translocation chromosome. A total of 36 RFLP markers selected from the seven homoeologous groups of wheat were used to characterize T09 and determine the homoeologous relationship of the introgressed Leymus chromosome with wheat. Only short arm markers for group 7 detected Leymus-specific fragments in T09, whereas 7AS-specific RFLP fragments were missing. C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization results indicated that T09 has a compensating Robertsonian translocation T7AL.7Lr#1S involving the long arm of wheat chromosome 7A and the short arm of Leymus chromosome 7Lr#1 substituting for chromosome arm 7AS of wheat. Introgression lines T01 (2n = 44) and T14 (2n = 44) each had two pairs of independent translocation chromosomes. T01 had T4BS.4BL-7Lr#1S + T4BL-7Lr#1S.5Lr#1S. T14 had T6BS.6BL-7Lr#1S + T6BL.5Lr#1S. These translocations were recovered in the progeny of the irradiated line Lr#1 (T5Lr#1S.7Lr#1S). The three translocation lines, T01, T09, and T14, and the disomic addition 7Lr#1 were consistently resistant to FHB in greenhouse point-inoculation experiments, whereas the disomic addition 5Lr#1 was susceptible. The data indicated that at least one novel FHB resistance gene from Leymus, designated Fhb3, resides in the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 7Lr#1, because the resistant translocation lines share a common distal segment of 7Lr#1S. Three PCR-based markers, BE586744-STS, BE404728-STS, and BE586111-STS, specific for 7Lr#1S were developed to expedite marker-assisted selection in breeding programs."

"21778183","abstracttext","Wheat is undoubtedly one of the world's major food sources since the dawn of Near Eastern agriculture and up to the present day. Morphological, physiological, and genetic modifications involved in domestication and subsequent evolution under domestication were investigated in a tetraploid recombinant inbred line population, derived from a cross between durum wheat and its immediate progenitor wild emmer wheat. Experimental data were used to test previous assumptions regarding a protracted domestication process. The brittle rachis (Br) spike, thought to be a primary characteristic of domestication, was mapped to chromosome 2A as a single gene, suggesting, in light of previously reported Br loci (homoeologous group 3), a complex genetic model involved in spike brittleness. Twenty-seven quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring threshability and yield components (kernel size and number of kernels per spike) were mapped. The large number of QTLs detected in this and other studies suggests that following domestication, wheat evolutionary processes involved many genomic changes. The Br gene did not show either genetic (co-localization with QTLs) or phenotypic association with threshability or yield components, suggesting independence of the respective loci. It is argued here that changes in spike threshability and agronomic traits (e.g. yield and its components) are the outcome of plant evolution under domestication, rather than the result of a protracted domestication process. Revealing the genomic basis of wheat domestication and evolution under domestication, and clarifying their inter-relationships, will improve our understanding of wheat biology and contribute to further crop improvement."
"21442411","articletitle","Functional relationships of phytoene synthase 1 alleles on chromosome 7A controlling flour colour variation in selected Australian wheat genotypes."
"21442411","abstracttext","Flour colour measured as a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) b* value is an important wheat quality attribute for a range of end-products, with genes and enzymes of the xanthophyll biosynthesis pathway providing potential sources of trait variation. In particular, the phytoene synthase 1 (Psy1) gene has been associated with quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flour b* colour variation. Several Psy1 alleles on chromosome 7A (Psy-A1) have been described, along with proposed mechanisms for influencing flour b* colour. This study sought to identify evolutionary relationships among known Psy-A1 alleles, to establish which Psy-A1 alleles are present in selected Australian wheat genotypes and establish their role in controlling variation for flour b* colour via QTL analysis. Phylogenetic analyses showed seven of eight known Psy-A1 alleles clustered with sequences from T. urartu, indicating the majority of alleles in Australian germplasm share a common evolutionary lineage. In this regard, Psy-A1a, Psy-A1c, Psy-A1e and Psy-A1p were common in Australian genotypes with flour b* colour ranging from white to yellow. In contrast Psy-A1s was found to be related to A. speltoides, indicating a possible A-B genome translocation during wheat polyploidisation. A new allele Psy-A1t (similar to Psy-A1s) was discovered in genotypes with yellow flour, with QTL analyses indicating Psy-A1t strongly influences flour b* colour in Australian germplasm. QTL LOD value maxima did not coincide with Psy-A1 gene locus in two of three populations and, therefore, Psy-A1a and Psy-A1p may not be involved in flour colour. Instead two other QTL were identified, one proximal and one distal to Psy-A1 in Australian wheat lines. Comparison of Psy-A1t and Psy-A1p predicted protein sequences suggests differences in putative sites for post-translational modification may influence enzyme activity and subsequent xanthophyll accumulation in the wheat endosperm. Psy-A1a and Psy-A1p were not involved in flour b* colour variation, indicating other genes control variation on chromosome 7A in some wheat genotypes."

"23261263","abstracttext","GIBBERELLIN-INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) functions as a gibberellin (GA) receptor and is a key component in the GA signaling pathway. In this paper, three TaGID1 genes, orthologous to rice OsGID1 (the first identified GA receptor GID1 gene), were isolated from hexaploid wheat using homology cloning. Like OsGID1, the three homologous TaGID1 genes consisted of two exons and one intron. Physical location analyses using nullisomic-tetrasomic and deletion lines derived from the wheat cultivar Chinese Spring revealed that the three homologous TaGID1 genes reside in the chromosome bins 1AL3-0.61-1, 1BL1-0.47-0.69, and 1DL2-0.41-1. Accordingly, they were named TaGID1-A1, TaGID1-B1, and TaGID1-D1, respectively. The expression patterns of the three TaGID1 genes were determined by real-time PCR in various wheat tissues at the heading stage, including flag leaves, young spikes, peduncles, and the third and fourth internodes. The three TaGID1 genes had similar transcript patterns, and all exhibited greater expression in flag leaves than in the other tissues. Moreover, they were all down-regulated after treatment with exogenous gibberellic acid (GA(3)) in young seedlings, suggesting a feedback regulation of TaGID1 in wheat. Yeast two-hybrid assays demonstrated strong interactions between each putative TaGID1 and the wheat DELLA proteins RHT-A1, RHT-B1, and RHT-D1 in the presence of GA(3), and weak interactions in the absence of GA(3) in yeast cells. Furthermore, over-expression of each TaGID1 gene in the Arabidopsis double mutant gid1a/1c partially rescued the dwarf phenotype. These results suggest that the three TaGID1 homologous genes are all functional GA receptor genes in wheat."
"23711079","articletitle","The wheat Lr34 gene provides resistance against multiple fungal pathogens in barley."
"23711079","abstracttext","The Lr34 gene encodes an ABC transporter and has provided wheat with durable, broad-spectrum resistance against multiple fungal pathogens for over 100 years. Because barley does not have an Lr34 ortholog, we expressed Lr34 in barley to investigate its potential as a broad-spectrum resistance resource in another grass species. We found that introduction of the genomic Lr34 sequence confers resistance against barley leaf rust and barley powdery mildew, two pathogens specific for barley but not virulent on wheat. In addition, the barley lines showed enhanced resistance against wheat stem rust. Transformation with the Lr34 cDNA or the genomic susceptible Lr34 allele did not result in increased resistance. Unlike wheat, where Lr34-conferred resistance is associated with adult plants, the genomic Lr34 transgenic barley lines exhibited multipathogen resistance in seedlings. These transgenic barley lines also developed leaf tip necrosis (LTN) in young seedlings, which correlated with an up-regulation of senescence marker genes and several pathogenesis-related (PR) genes. In wheat, transcriptional expression of Lr34 is highest in adult plants and correlates with increased resistance and LTN affecting the last emerging leaf. The severe phenotype of transgenic Lr34 barley resulted in reduced plant growth and total grain weight. These results demonstrate that Lr34 provides enhanced multipathogen resistance early in barley plant development and implies the conservation of the substrate and mechanism of the LR34 transporter and its molecular action between wheat and barley. With controlled gene expression, the use of Lr34 may be valuable for many cereal breeding programmes, particularly given its proven durability."
"23832668","articletitle","Chromosomal location of wheat genes of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and evidence for a catalase gene on chromosome 7A functionally associated with flour b* colour variation."
"23832668","abstracttext","Knowledge of molecular and genetic mechanisms controlling wheat grain quality characteristics is significant for improving flour for end-product functionality. Flour b* colour is an important quality trait for breeding wheat varieties to produce grain for specific market requirements. The degree of flour yellowness is due to the accumulation of carotenoids in grain, particularly lutein. Flour b* is under polygenic control and quantitative trait loci (QTL) have frequently been reported on chromosome 7AL. Analysis of carotenoid genes showed that phytoene synthase (PSY) co-located to the QTL on 7AL but other genes at this locus are also thought to contribute flour b* colour variation. This study used the wheat genome survey sequence and identified the chromosomal location of all wheat carotenoid genes, but none other than PSY were located on 7AL and, therefore, other genes may control flour b* colour variation including oxidative genes that degrade carotenoids. An investigation of EST bin mapped to 7AL identified a gene encoding a catalase enzyme (Cat3-A1) that was phylogenetically related to other plant class III enzymes, co-located to the QTL for flour b* colour variation on 7AL in three mapping populations and expressed during seed development. Therefore, Cat3-A1 was functionally associated with flour b* colour variation. Catalase acts upon hydrogen peroxide as a substrate and it was postulated that Cat3-A1 alleles control varying degrees of bleaching action on lutein in developing wheat grain. Markers for Cat3-A1 developed in this study can be used in conjunction with other candidate gene markers including phytoene synthase and lycopene-ε-cylase to develop a molecular signature for selecting lines with specific flour b* colour values in wheat breeding."

"24190269","abstracttext","Transfer of resistance toHeterodera avenae, the cereal cyst nematode (CCN), by a ""stepping-stone"" procedure from the wild grassAegilops ventricosa to hexaploid wheat has been demonstrated. The number of nematodes per plant was lower, and reached a plateau much earlier, in the resistant introgression line H93-8 (1-2 nematodes per plant) than in the recipient H10-15 wheat (14-16 nematodes per plant). Necrosis (hypersensitive reaction) near the nematode, little cell fusion, and few, often degraded syncytia were observed in infested H93-8 roots, while abundant, well-formed syncytia were present in the susceptible H10-15 wheat. Line H93-8 was highly resistant to the two Spanish populations tested, as well as the four French races (Fr1-Fr4), and the British pathotype Hall, but was susceptible to the Swedish pathotypes HgI and HgIII. Resistance was inherited as though determined by a single quasi-dominant factor in the F2 generations resulting from crosses of H93-8 with H10-15 and with Loros, a resistant wheat carrying the geneCre1 (syn.Ccn1). The resistance gene in H93-8 (Cre2 orCcn2) is not allelic with respect to that in Loros. RFLPs and other markers, together with the cytogenetical evidence, indicate that theCre2 gene has been integrated into a wheat chromosome without affecting its meiotic pairing ability. Introduction ofCre2 by backcrossing into a commercial wheat backgroud increases grain yield when under challenge by the nematode and is not detrimental in the absence of infestation."
"24124925","articletitle","Rye Pm8 and wheat Pm3 are orthologous genes and show evolutionary conservation of resistance function against powdery mildew."
"24124925","abstracttext","The improvement of wheat through breeding has relied strongly on the use of genetic material from related wild and domesticated grass species. The 1RS chromosome arm from rye was introgressed into wheat and crossed into many wheat lines, as it improves yield and fungal disease resistance. Pm8 is a powdery mildew resistance gene on 1RS which, after widespread agricultural cultivation, is now widely overcome by adapted mildew races. Here we show by homology-based cloning and subsequent physical and genetic mapping that Pm8 is the rye orthologue of the Pm3 allelic series of mildew resistance genes in wheat. The cloned gene was functionally validated as Pm8 by transient, single-cell expression analysis and stable transformation. Sequence analysis revealed a complex mosaic of ancient haplotypes among Pm3- and Pm8-like genes from different members of the Triticeae. These results show that the two genes have evolved independently after the divergence of the species 7.5 million years ago and kept their function in mildew resistance. During this long time span the co-evolving pathogens have not overcome these genes, which is in strong contrast to the breakdown of Pm8 resistance since its introduction into commercial wheat 70 years ago. Sequence comparison revealed that evolutionary pressure acted on the same subdomains and sequence features of the two orthologous genes. This suggests that they recognize directly or indirectly the same pathogen effectors that have been conserved in the powdery mildews of wheat and rye."

"26372220","abstracttext","Wheat is one of the main food sources worldwide; large amount studies have been conducted to improve wheat production. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) with about 20-30 nucleotide are a class of regulatory small RNAs (sRNAs), which could regulate gene expression through sequence-specific base pairing with target mRNAs, playing important roles in plant growth. An ideal plant architecture (IPA) is crucial to enhance yield in bread wheat. In this study, the high-yield wheat strain Yunong 3114 was EMS-mutagenesis from the wild-type strain Yunong 201, exhibiting a preferable plant structure compared with the wild-type strain. We constructed small RNA and degradome libraries from Yunong 201 and Yunong 3114, and performed small RNA sequencing of these libraries in order identify miRNAs and their targets related to IPA in wheat. Totally, we identified 488 known and 837 novel miRNAs from Yunong 3114 and 391 known and 533 novel miRNAs from Yunong 201. The number of miRNAs in the mutant increased. A total of 37 known and 432 putative novel miRNAs were specifically expressed in the mutant strain; furthermore, 23 known and 159 putative novel miRNAs were specifically expressed in the wild-type strain. A total of 150 known and 100 novel miRNAs were differentially expressed between mutant and wild-type strains. Among these differentially expressed novel miRNAs, 4 and 8 predict novel miRNAs were evidenced by degradome sequencing and showed up-regulated and down-regulated expressions in the mutant strain Yunong 3114, respectively. Targeted gene annotation and previous results indicated that this set of miRNAs is related to plant structure. Our results further suggested that miRNAs may be necessary to obtain an optimal wheat structure."

"25273129","abstracttext_key message","We show the application of association mapping and genomic selection for key breeding targets using a large panel of elite winter wheat varieties and a large volume of agronomic data. The heightening urgency to increase wheat production in line with the needs of a growing population, and in the face of climatic uncertainty, mean new approaches, including association mapping (AM) and genomic selection (GS) need to be validated and applied in wheat breeding. Key adaptive responses are the cornerstone of regional breeding. There is evidence that new ideotypes for long-standing traits such as flowering time may be required. In order to detect targets for future marker-assisted improvement and validate the practical application of GS for wheat breeding we genotyped 376 elite wheat varieties with 3,046 DArT, single nucleotide polymorphism and gene markers and measured seven traits in replicated yield trials over 2 years in France, Germany and the UK. The scale of the phenotyping exceeds the breadth of previous AM and GS studies in these key economic wheat production regions of Northern Europe. Mixed-linear modelling (MLM) detected significant marker-trait associations across and within regions. Genomic prediction using elastic net gave low to high prediction accuracies depending on the trait, and could be experimentally increased by modifying the constituents of the training population (TP). We also tested the use of differentially penalised regression to integrate candidate gene and genome-wide markers to predict traits, demonstrating the validity and simplicity of this approach. Overall, our results suggest that whilst AM offers potential for application in both research and breeding, GS represents an exciting opportunity to select key traits, and that optimisation of the TP is crucial to its successful implementation."

"26043144","abstracttext","Several studies have described quantitative trait loci (QTL) for seed size in wheat, but the relevant genes and molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here we report the functional characterization of the wheat TaCYP78A3 gene and its effect on seed size. TaCYP78A3 encoded wheat cytochrome P450 CYP78A3, and was specifically expressed in wheat reproductive organs. TaCYP78A3 activity was positively correlated with the final seed size. Its silencing caused a reduction of cell number in the seed coat, resulting in an 11% decrease in wheat seed size, whereas TaCYP78A3 over-expression induced production of more cells in the seed coat, leading to an 11-48% increase in Arabidopsis seed size. In addition, the cell number in the final seed coat was determined by the TaCYP78A3 expression level, which affected the extent of integument cell proliferation in the developing ovule and seed. Unfortunately, TaCYP78A3 over-expression in Arabidopsis caused a reduced seed set due to an ovule developmental defect. Moreover, TaCYP78A3 over-expression affected embryo development by promoting embryo integument cell proliferation during seed development, which also ultimately affected the final seed size in Arabidopsis. In summary, our results indicated that TaCYP78A3 plays critical roles in influencing seed size by affecting the extent of integument cell proliferation. The present study provides direct evidence that TaCYP78A3 affects seed size in wheat, and contributes to an understanding of the cellular basis of the gene influencing seed development."

"27091129","abstracttext_key message","New SNP markers that can be used for marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning saturate the chromosome region carrying SrCad , a wheat gene that confers resistance to Ug99 stem rust. Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. Development of cultivars with effective resistance has been the primary means to control this disease, but the appearance of new virulent strains such as Ug99 has rendered most wheat varieties vulnerable. The stem rust resistance gene SrCad located on chromosome arm 6DS has provided excellent resistance to various strains of Ug99 in field nurseries conducted in Njoro, Kenya since 2005. Three genetic populations were used to identify SNP markers closely linked to the SrCad locus. Of 220 SNP markers evaluated, 27 were found to be located within a 2 cM region surrounding SrCad. The diagnostic potential of these SNPs was evaluated in a diverse set of 50 wheat lines that were primarily of Canadian origin with known presence or absence of SrCad. Three SNP markers tightly linked proximally to SrCad and one SNP that co-segregated with SrCad were completely predictive of the presence or absence of SrCad. These markers also differentiated SrCad from Sr42 and SrTmp which are also located in the same region of chromosome arm 6DS. These markers should be useful in marker-assisted breeding to develop new wheat varieties containing SrCad-based resistance to Ug99 stem rust."

"27148348","abstracttext","N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs) are involved in plant resistance; however, the role of SYP71 in the regulation of plant-pathogen interactions is not well known. In this study, we characterized a plant-specific SNARE in wheat, TaSYP71, which contains a Qc-SNARE domain. Three homologs are localized on chromosome 1AL, 1BL, and 1DL. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression, TaSYP71 was localized to the plasma membrane in Nicotiana benthamiana. Quantitative real-time PCR assays revealed that TaSYP71 homologs was induced by NaCl, H2O2 stress and infection by virulent and avirulent Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) isolates. Heterologous expression of TaSYP71 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe elevated tolerance to H2O2. Meanwhile, H2O2 scavenging gene (TaCAT) was downregulated in TaSYP71 silenced plants treated by H2O2 compared to that in control, which indicated that TaSYP71 enhanced tolerance to H2O2 stress possibly by influencing the expression of TaCAT to remove the excessive H2O2 accumulation. When TaSYP71 homologs were all silenced in wheat by the virus-induced gene silencing system, wheat plants were more susceptible to Pst, with larger infection area and more haustoria number, but the necrotic area of wheat mesophyll cells were larger, one possible explanation that minor contribution of resistance to Pst was insufficient to hinder pathogen extension when TaSYP71 were silenced, and the necrotic area was enlarged accompanied with the pathogen growth. Of course, later cell death could not be excluded. In addition, the expression of pathogenesis-related genes were down-regulated in TaSYP71 silenced wheat plants. These results together suggest that TaSYP71 play a positive role in wheat defense against Pst."

"28710914","abstracttext","Improving photosynthetic capability is one of the most important factors for increasing wheat yield potential. The photosynthetic capability of wheat germplasm with different alien chromosomes was investigated and compared with bread wheat cultivars (BC) in this study, including wheat addition lines (CA), hexaploid triticale (HT), octoploid triticale (OT), and synthetic hexaploid wheat lines (SHW). Results indicated that HT, OT, and SHW produced significantly higher biomass plant -1 (BMPP), with HT displaying the highest grain yield plant -1 (GYPP). Distinct superiority of net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and carboxylation activities of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) was observed in HT and OT. Meanwhile, OT showed the highest expression of the Rubisco large subunit gene (rbcL) in the flag leaves at heading and grain-filling stages, though the coding region of rbcL was highly conserved in all investigated materials. Further analysis indicated that OT and Chinese Spring-rye disomic addition lines displayed higher expression of Rubisco small subunit gene (rbcS). Correlation analysis revealed significant and positive correlations between Pn and the expressions of rbcL (at both heading and grain-filling stages), the expression of rbcS (at heading stage), and the carboxylation activity of Rubisco (at grain-filling stage). Anatomical structure analysis of the chloroplasts showed SHW with longer chloroplasts and more chloroplast grana and grana lamella. In the present study, HT, OT, and Chinese Spring-rye disomic addition lines with rye chromosomes displayed greater photosynthetic capability than BC and SHW, and could be applied in breeding programs to improve the photosynthetic efficiency of wheat."

"28463975","abstracttext","Triploid wheat hybrids between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii sometimes show abnormal growth phenotypes, and the growth abnormalities inhibit generation of wheat synthetic hexaploids. In type II necrosis, one of the growth abnormalities, necrotic cell death accompanied by marked growth repression occurs only under low temperature conditions. At normal temperature, the type II necrosis lines show grass-clump dwarfism with no necrotic symptoms, excess tillers, severe dwarfism and delayed flowering. Here, we report comparative expression analyses to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity in the triploid wheat hybrids. We compared gene and small RNA expression profiles in crown tissues to characterize the temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity. No up-regulation of defense-related genes was observed under the normal temperature, and down-regulation of wheat APETALA1-like MADS-box genes, considered to act as flowering promoters, was found in the grass-clump dwarf lines. Some microRNAs, including miR156, were up-regulated, whereas the levels of transcripts of the miR156 target genes SPLs, known to inhibit tiller and branch number, were reduced in crown tissues of the grass-clump dwarf lines at the normal temperature. Unusual expression of the miR156/SPLs module could explain the grass-clump dwarf phenotype. Dramatic alteration of gene expression profiles, including miRNA levels, in crown tissues is associated with the temperature-dependent phenotypic plasticity in type II necrosis/grass-clump dwarf wheat hybrids."

"27607023","abstracttext","Drought stress adversely affects the growth and yield of wheat. The present study was planned to investigate the effect of inoculation of plant-growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains IG 3 (Klebsiella sp.), IG 10 (Enterobacter ludwigii) and IG 15 (Flavobacterium sp.) in improving drought tolerance in wheat. These PGPR strains were screened for drought tolerance in nutrient broth supplemented with different concentrations (0-25%) of polyethylene glycol (PEG6000). Effect of PGPR inoculation on various physiological, biochemical parameters and gene expression of stress responsive genes were studied under drought stress. Root colonization at the surface and interiors of roots was demonstrated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and tetrazolium staining, respectively. Drought stress significantly affected various growth parameters, water status, membrane integrity, osmolyte accumulation and stress-responsive gene expressions, which were positively altered by PGPR-inoculation in wheat. Quantitative real-time (qRT)-PCR analysis revealed the up regulation of some stress-related genes (DREB2A and CAT1) in un-inoculated wheat plants exposed to drought stress. PGPR-inoculated plants showed attenuated transcript levels suggesting improved drought tolerance due to interaction of PGPRs. The PGPR strain IG 3 was found to be the best in terms of influencing biochemical and physiological status of the seedlings under drought stress. Our report demonstrates the role of PGPRs Enterobacter ludwigii and Flavobacterium sp. in plant growth promotion of wheat plants under drought stress. The study reports the potential of PGPR in alleviating drought stress in wheat which could be used as potent biofertilizers."

Using the marker Tamyb10D , 1629- and 1178-bp PCR fragments were amplified from the tolerant varieties, whereas a 1178-bp fragment was from the susceptible ones. Of the Chinese bread wheat varieties and advanced lines, 103 were used to validate the relationship between the polymorphic fragments of Tamyb10D and PHS tolerance. Statistical analysis indicated that Tamyb10D was significantly ( P  < 0.001) associated with depth of seed dormancy in these germplasms. To further confirm the association between allelic variants of Tamyb10-D1 and PHS tolerance, 200 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross between Zhongyou 9507 (1178-bp fragment) and Yangxiaomai (1178- and 1629-bp fragments) were genotyped using the marker Tamyb10D . General linear model analysis indicated that variation in Tamyb10-D1 had a significant ( P  < 0.001) association with the germination index (GI) values, explaining 13.7, 4.7, and 9.8 % of the phenotypic variation in GI in Shijiazhuang, Beijing, and the averaged data from those environments, respectively.

"27422445","abstracttext_key message","Powdery mildew resistance gene Pm55 was physically mapped to chromosome arm 5VS FL 0.60-0.80 of Dasypyrum villosum . Pm55 is present in T5VS·5AL and T5VS·5DL translocations, which should be valuable resources for wheat improvement. Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is a major wheat disease worldwide. Exploiting novel genes effective against powdery mildew from wild relatives of wheat is a promising strategy for controlling this disease. To identify novel resistance genes for powdery mildew from Dasypyrum villosum, a wild wheat relative, we evaluated a set of Chinese Spring-D. villosum disomic addition and whole-arm translocation lines for reactions to powdery mildew. Based on the evaluation data, we concluded that the D. villosum chromosome 5V controls post-seedling resistance to powdery mildew. Subsequently, three introgression lines were developed and confirmed by molecular and cytogenetic analysis following ionizing radiation of the pollen of a Chinese Spring-D. villosum 5V disomic addition line. A homozygous T5VS·5AL translocation line (NAU421) with good plant vigor and full fertility was further characterized using sequential genomic in situ hybridization, C-banding, and EST-STS marker analysis. A dominant gene permanently named Pm55 was located in chromosome bin 5VS 0.60-0.80 based on the responses to powdery mildew of all wheat-D. villosum 5V introgression lines evaluated at both seeding and adult stages. This study demonstrated that Pm55 conferred growth-stage and tissue-specific dependent resistance; therefore, it provides a novel resistance type for powdery mildew. The T5VS·5AL translocation line with additional softness loci Dina/Dinb of D. villosum provides a possibility of extending the range of grain textures to a super-soft category. Accordingly, this stock is a new source of resistance to powdery mildew and may be useful in both resistance mechanism studies and soft wheat improvement."

"28238022","abstracttext_key message","The Bt9 resistance locus was mapped and shown to be distinct from the Bt10 locus. New markers linked to Bt9 have been identified and may be used to breed for resistance towards the seed-borne disease. Increasing organic wheat production in Denmark, and in other wheat-producing areas, in conjunction with legal requirements for organic seed production, may potentially lead to a rise in common bunt occurrence. As systemic pesticides are not used in organic farming, organic wheat production systems may benefit from genetic resistances. However, little is known about the underlying genetic mechanisms and locations of the resistance factors for common bunt resistance in wheat. A double haploid (DH) population segregating for common bunt resistance was used to identify the chromosomal location of common bunt resistance gene Bt9. DH lines were phenotyped in three environments and genotyped with DArTseq and SSR markers. The total length of the resulting linkage map was 2882 cM distributed across all 21 wheat chromosomes. Bt9 was mapped to the distal end of chromosome 6DL. Since wheat common bunt resistance gene Bt10 is also located on chromosome 6D, the possibility of their co-location was investigated. A comparison of marker sequences linked to Bt9 and Bt10 on physical maps of chromosome 6D confirmed that Bt9 and Bt10 are two distinct resistance factors located at the distal (6DL) and proximal (6DS) end, respectively, of chromosome 6D. Five new SSR markers Xgpw4005-1, Xgpw7433, Xwmc773, Xgpw7303 and Xgpw362 and many SNP and PAV markers flanking the Bt9 resistance locus were identified and they may be used in the future for marker-assisted selection."

"29090430","abstracttext_key message","Hybrid abnormalities, severe growth abortion and grass-clump dwarfism, were found in the tetraploid wheat/Aegilops umbellulata hybrids, and the gene expression changes were conserved in the hybrids with those in other wheat synthetic hexaploids. Aegilops umbellulata Zhuk., a diploid goatgrass species with a UU genome, has been utilized as a genetic resource for wheat breeding. Here, we examine the reproductive barriers between tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon (Ldn) and various Ae. umbellulata accessions by conducting interspecific crossings. Through systematic cross experiments, three types of hybrid incompatibilities were found: seed production failure in crosses, hybrid growth abnormalities and sterility in the ABU hybrids. Hybrid incompatibilities were widely distributed over the entire range of the natural species, and in about 50% of the cross combinations between tetraploid Ldn and Ae. umbellulata accessions, ABU F 1 hybrids showed one of two abnormal growth phenotypes: severe growth abortion (SGA) or grass-clump dwarfism. Expression of the shoot meristem maintenance-related and cell cycle-related genes was markedly repressed in crown tissues of hybrids showing SGA, suggesting dysfunction of mitotic cell division in the shoot apices. The grass-clump dwarf phenotype may be explained by down-regulation of wheat APETALA1-like MADS box genes, which act as flowering promoters, and altered expression in crown tissues of the miR156/SPLs module, which controls tiller number and branching. These gene expression changes in growth abnormalities were well conserved between the Ldn/Ae. umbellulata plants and interspecific hybrids from crosses of Ldn and wheat D-genome progenitor Ae. tauschii."

The composition of the wheat grain determines the functional properties of wheat including milling efficiency, bread making, and nutritional value. Transcriptome analysis of the developing wheat grain provides key insights into the molecular basis for grain development and quality."
"29020946","abstracttext_results","The transcriptome of 35 genotypes was analysed by RNA-Seq at two development stages (14 and 30 days-post-anthesis, dpa) corresponding to the mid stage of development (stage Z75) and the almost mature seed (stage Z85). At 14dpa, most of the transcripts were associated with the synthesis of the major seed components including storage proteins and starch. At 30dpa, a diverse range of genes were expressed at low levels with a predominance of genes associated with seed defence and stress tolerance. RNA-Seq analysis of changes in expression between 14dpa and 30dpa stages revealed 26,477 transcripts that were significantly differentially expressed at a FDR corrected p-value cut-off at ≤0.01. Functional annotation and gene ontology mapping was performed and KEGG pathway mapping allowed grouping based upon biochemical linkages. This analysis demonstrated that photosynthesis associated with the pericarp was very active at 14dpa but had ceased by 30dpa. Recently reported genes for flour yield in milling and bread quality were found to influence wheat quality largely due to expression patterns at the earlier seed development stage."

"29746879","abstracttext","Heat stress has an adverse effect on the quality and quantity of agriculturally important crops, especially wheat. The tolerance mechanism has not been explored much in wheat and very few genes/ TFs responsive to heat stress is available on public domain. Here, we identified, cloned and characterized a putative TaHSFA6e TF gene of 1.3 kb from wheat cv. HD2985. We observed an ORF of 368 aa with Hsf DNA binding signature domain in the amino acid sequence. Single copy number of TaHSFA6e was observed integrated in the genome of wheat. Expression analysis of TaHSFA6e under differential HS showed maximum transcripts in wheat cv. Halna (thermotolerant) in response to 38 °C for 2 h during pollination and grain-filling stages, as compared to PBW343, HD2329 and HD2985. Putative target genes of TaHSFA6e (HSP17, HSP70 and HSP90) showed upregulation in response to differential HS (30 & 38 °C, 2 h) during pollination and grain-filling stages. Small HSP17 was observed most triggered in Halna under HS. We observed increase in the catalase, guaiacol peroxidase, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and decrease in the lipid peroxidation in thermotolerant cvs. (Halna, HD2985), as compared to thermosusceptible (PBW343, HD2329) under differential HS. Multiple stresses (heat - 38 °C, 2 h, and drought - 100 mL of 20% polyethylene Glycol 6000) during seedling stage of wheat showed positive correlation between the expression of TaHSFA6e, putative targets (HSP70, HSP90, HSP17) and TAC. Halna (thermotolerant) performed better, as compared to other contrasting cvs. TaHSFA6e TF can be used as promising candidate gene for manipulating the heat stress-tolerance network."

Wild relatives are rich gene resources for cultivated wheat. The development of alien addition chromosome lines not only greatly broadens the genetic diversity, but also provides genetic stocks for comparative genomics studies. Roegneria ciliaris (genome S c S c Y c Y c ), a tetraploid wild relative of wheat, is tolerant or resistant to many abiotic and biotic stresses. To develop a complete set of wheat-R. ciliaris disomic addition lines (DALs), we undertook a euplasmic backcrossing program to overcome allocytoplasmic effects and preferential chromosome transmission. To improve the efficiency of identifying chromosomes from S c and Y c , we established techniques including sequential genomic in situ hybridization/fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and molecular marker analysis. Fourteen DALs of wheat, each containing one pair of R. ciliaris chromosomes pairs, were characterized by FISH using four repetitive sequences [pTa794, pTa71, RcAfa and (GAA) 10 ] as probes. One hundred and sixty-two R. ciliaris-specific markers were developed. FISH and marker analysis enabled us to assign the homoeologous groups and genome affinities of R. ciliaris chromosomes. FHB resistance evaluation in successive five growth seasons showed that the amphiploid, DA2Y c , DA5Y c and DA6S c had improved FHB resistance, indicating their potential value in wheat improvement. The 14 DALs are likely new gene resources and will be phenotyped for more agronomic performances traits."

"32208259","abstracttext","Produced water (PW) is a major waste-product of oil and gas production that some consider a viable agricultural irrigation water source. However, the presence of petroleum hydrocarbons, toxic metals and potentially high salinity of PW may be deleterious for soil health. Thus, we irrigated wheat with minimally treated PW to investigate effects on soil health, wheat growth, and the soil microbiome. Irrigation treatments included control irrigation water (IW), 1% and 5% PW dilutions (1% PW, 5% PW), and a saltwater solution with salinity equivalent to the 5% PW dilution (SW). Wheat was irrigated three times a week, for a total of 2.1 L per pot by harvest. During wheat growth, we measured plant physiological parameters, soil electrical conductivity, as well as profiled soil microbial diversity by performing 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene analysis. Soil health parameters were measured after harvest, including chemical, biological, physical, and nutrient properties that were used to calculate an overall soil health index (SQI). SQI analysis revealed that the SW and 5% PW treatments had significantly reduced soil health as compared to the control. Furthermore, the 16S rRNA gene analysis showed that the microbial community membership and structure was significantly different between irrigation treatments, highlighting shifts in the soil microbiome which may impact soil biochemical cycling. Both the SW- and 5% PW-treated wheat had reduced yields as compared to the control. Our results indicate that irrigating wheat with minimally treated PW may result in yield decreases, as well as reducing both overall soil health and soil microbial community diversity. Future large-scale field studies are needed to determine the long-term soil health effects of PW on different soil types and crops."

"30183124","abstracttext","Plant height is among the most important agronomic traits that influence crop yield. However, in addition to the Rht-1 alleles, the molecular basis of plant height in bread wheat remains largely unclear. Based on wheat gene expression profiling analysis, we identify a light-regulated gene from bread wheat, designated as TaCOLD1, whose encoding protein is homologous to cold sensor COLD1 in rice. We show that TaCOLD1 protein is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and plasma membrane. Phenotypic analyses show that overexpression of a mutated form of TaCOLD1 (M187K) in bread wheat cultivar Kenong199 (Rht-B1b) background resulted in an obvious reduction in plant height. Further, we demonstrate that the hydrophilic loop of TaCOLD1 (residues 178-296) can interact with TaGα-7A (the α subunit of heterotrimeric G protein) protein but not TaGα-1B, and the mutation (M187K) in TaCOLD1 remarkably enhances its interaction with TaGα-7A. Physical interaction analyses show that the C-terminal region of TaGα-7A, which is lacking in the TaGα-1B protein, is necessary for its interaction with TaCOLD1. Intriguingly, the C-terminal region of TaGα-7A is also physically associated with the TaDEP1 protein (an atypical Gγ subunit). Significantly, we discover that TaCOLD1 and mTaCOLD1 (M187K) can interfere with the physical association between TaGα-7A and TaDEP1. Together, this study reveals that TaCOLD1 acts as a novel regulator of plant height through interfering with the formation of heterotrimeric G protein complex in bread wheat and is a valuable target for the engineering of wheat plant architecture."

"30327843","abstracttext_key message","A set of molecular markers was developed for Sr26 from comparative genomic analysis. The comparative genomic approach also enabled the identification of a previously uncharacterised wheat chromosome that carried Sr26. Stem rust of wheat, a biotic stress caused by a fungal pathogen, continues to pose significant threats to wheat production. Considerable effort has been directed at surveillance and breeding approaches to minimize the impact of the widely virulent race of the stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Pgt) commonly known as Ug99 (TTKSK) and other races in its lineage. The stem rust resistance gene Sr26, derived from Thinopyrum ponticum, is an excellent example of the successful utilization of a gene from a wild relative of a crop plant and remains one of the few durable sources of resistance currently effective against all known field isolates of Pgt. We explored comparative genomic analysis of the nucleotide binding leucine rich repeat (NLR) genes of the diploid D genome and bread wheat genomes to target the Sr26 region from the non-sequenced Th. ponticum genome. A chromosomal interval harboring NLR genes in the distal end of homoeologous group 6 chromosomes was used to demarcate the Sr26 locus. A set of closely linked PCR-based molecular markers was developed for Sr26. Furthermore, the comparative analysis approach enabled the unambiguous identification of a previously uncharacterised wheat chromosome that carried Sr26 in an introgressed Th. ponticum segment and was validated by fluorescent and genomic in situ hybridisation (FISH/GISH) experiments. The genetic information generated from the target interval based on this study will benefit future related studies on group 6 chromosomes of wheat, including 6D t from Aegilops tauschii, and chromosome 6Ae#1 from Th. ponticum."

"31370789","abstracttext_background","Wheat grains contain gluten proteins, which harbour immunogenic epitopes that trigger Coeliac disease in 1-2% of the human population. Wheat varieties or accessions containing only safe gluten have not been identified and conventional breeding alone struggles to achieve such a goal, as the epitopes occur in gluten proteins encoded by five multigene families, these genes are partly located in tandem arrays, and bread wheat is allohexaploid. Gluten immunogenicity can be reduced by modification or deletion of epitopes. Mutagenesis technologies, including CRISPR/Cas9, provide a route to obtain bread wheat containing gluten proteins with fewer immunogenic epitopes."

We compared the results with those obtained with random mutagenesis in cultivar Paragon by γ-irradiation. For this, Acid-PAGE was used to identify T1 grains with altered gliadin protein profiles compared to the wild-type endosperm. We first optimised the interpretation of Acid-PAGE gels using Chinese Spring deletion lines. We then analysed the changes generated in 360 Paragon γ-irradiated lines and in 117 Fielder CRISPR/Cas9 lines.

"31250230","abstracttext","Although the economic value of wheat flour is determined by the complement of gluten proteins, these proteins have been challenging to study because of the complexity of the major protein groups and the tremendous sequence diversity among wheat cultivars. The completion of a high-quality wheat genome sequence from the reference wheat Chinese Spring recently facilitated the assembly and annotation of a complete set of gluten protein genes from a single cultivar, making it possible to link individual proteins in the flour to specific gene sequences. In a proteomic analysis of total wheat flour protein from Chinese Spring using quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis combined with tandem mass spectrometry, gliadins or low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits were identified as the predominant proteins in 72 protein spots. Individual spots were associated with 40 of 56 Chinese Spring gene sequences, including 16 of 26 alpha gliadins, 10 of 11 gamma gliadins, six of seven omega gliadins, one of two delta gliadins, and nine of ten LMW-GS. Most genes that were not associated with protein spots were either expressed at low levels in endosperm or encoded proteins with high similarity to other proteins. A wide range of protein accumulation levels were observed and discrepancies between transcript levels and protein levels were noted. This work together with similar studies using other commercial cultivars should provide new insight into the molecular basis of wheat flour quality and allergenic potential."

"32912491","abstracttext","SRO (SIMILAR TO RCD ONE), a type of plant-specific small protein family, play important roles in plant growth and development, as well as in response to biotic/abiotic stresses. Although characterization of SROs have been performed in model plants, little is known about their function in wheat, especially under stress conditions. In this study, 30 SRO genes were identified from the wheat genome (TaSRO). They were phylogenetically separated into two groups with distinct structures. The cis-regulatory elements in the promoter region of TaSROs were analyzed and numerous elements functionally associated with stress responding and hormones were interpreted, implying the reason for induction expression patterns of TaSROs during abiotic and biotic stresses in wheat. Whole-genome replication events in the SRO gene family of wheat and seven other species (Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, maize, barley, soybean, upland cotton, and cucumber) were analyzed, resulting in 1, 12, 9, 23, 6, 5, and 3 of gene pairs, respectively. The tissue-specific expression pattern profiling revealed that most TaSROs are highly expressed in one or more tissues and may play an important role in wheat growth and development. In addition, qRT-PCR results further confirmed that these TaSRO genes are involved in wheat stress response. In summary, our study laid a theoretical basis for molecular function deciphering of TaSROs, especially in plant hormones and biotic/abiotic stress responses."

"17270010","abstracttext","Brachypodium sylvaticum and Brachypodium distachyon were recently proposed as new model plants because of their small genomes and their phylogenetic position between rice and Triticeae crops. We sequenced a 371-kb region in B. sylvaticum, the largest genomic sequence available so far from this species, providing quantitative data on gene conservation, collinearity and phylogeny. We compared it with orthologous regions from rice and wheat. Brachypodium and wheat show perfect macro-collinearity of genetic markers, whereas rice contains an approximately 220-kb inversion. Rice contains almost twice as many genes as Brachypodium in the region studied, whereas wheat has about 40% more. Through comparative annotation, we identified alternative transcripts and improved the annotation for several rice genes, indicating that approximately 15% of rice genes might require re-annotation. Surprisingly, our data suggest that 10-15% of functional sequences in small grass genomes may not encode any proteins. From available genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences, we estimated Brachypodium to have diverged from wheat about 35-40 Mya, significantly more recently than the divergence of rice and wheat. However, our data also indicate that orthologous regions from Brachypodium and wheat differ considerably in gene content, thus the Brachypodium genome sequence probably cannot replace genomic studies in the large Triticeae genomes."
"17158798","articletitle","The wheat and barley vernalization gene VRN3 is an orthologue of FT."
"17158798","abstracttext","Winter wheat and barley varieties require an extended exposure to low temperatures to accelerate flowering (vernalization), whereas spring varieties do not have this requirement. In this study, we show that in these species, the vernalization gene VRN3 is linked completely to a gene similar to Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). FT induction in the leaves results in a transmissible signal that promotes flowering. Transcript levels of the barley and wheat orthologues, designated as HvFT and TaFT, respectively, are significantly higher in plants homozygous for the dominant Vrn3 alleles (early flowering) than in plants homozygous for the recessive vrn3 alleles (late flowering). In wheat, the dominant Vrn3 allele is associated with the insertion of a retroelement in the TaFT promoter, whereas in barley, mutations in the HvFT first intron differentiate plants with dominant and recessive VRN3 alleles. Winter wheat plants transformed with the TaFT allele carrying the promoter retroelement insertion flowered significantly earlier than nontransgenic plants, supporting the identity between TaFT and VRN-B3. Statistical analyses of flowering times confirmed the presence of significant interactions between vernalization and FT allelic classes in both wheat and barley (P < 0.0001). These interactions were supported further by the observed up-regulation of HvFT transcript levels by vernalization in barley winter plants (P = 0.002). These results confirmed that the wheat and barley FT genes are responsible for natural allelic variation in vernalization requirement, providing additional sources of adaptive diversity to these economically important crops."

"19370089","abstracttext","The allotetraploid species Aegilops variabilis Eig (2n = 28, UUSvSv) belongs to the tribe Triticeae and is closely related to wheat. One accession, Ae. variabilis No. 1, was found to be resistant to the cereal cyst nematode (CCN) and the root-knot nematode (RKN). As the genetic variability for resistance to those two pests is limited within wheat, this accession was crossed to bread wheat. Previous work enabled the development of two addition lines and two translocation lines carrying resistance. Here, we demonstrate, using genomic in situ hybridization, that there is no U-Sv interchange in the parental accession of Ae. variabilis. However, there are multiple rearrangements in the Sv chromosomes. The Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying the CreX gene for resistance to CCN combined segments with homoeology to wheat groups 1, 2, 4, and 6. The CreX gene belongs to the group 1 part and it was likely to have been introduced into chromosome 1BL at a similar location as the previously found QTL QCre.srd-1B for CCN resistance. The second Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying CreY and Rkn2 combined segments with homoeology to wheat groups 2, 4, and 7 on its short arm and group 3 on its long arm. It was designated as 3Sv. The two genes for resistance are carried by its long arm and have been transferred to wheat chromosome 3BL through homoeologous and genetically balanced recombination. Different SSR markers present in the introgressed segments could be used in marker-assisted selection."

"31998329","abstracttext","MicroRNAs are small RNAs that regulate gene expression in eukaryotes. In this study, we analyzed the small RNA profiles of two cultivars that exhibit different reactions to stripe rust infection: one susceptible, the other partially resistant. Using small RNA libraries prepared from the two wheat cultivars infected with stripe rust fungus ( Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ), we identified 182 previously known miRNAs, 91 variants of known miRNAs, and 163 candidate novel wheat miRNAs. Known miRNA loci were usually copied in all three wheat sub-genomes, whereas novel miRNA loci were often specific to a single sub-genome. DESeq2 analysis of differentially expressed microRNAs revealed 23 miRNAs that exhibit cultivar-specific differences. TA078/miR399b showed cultivar-specific differential regulation in response to infection. Using different target prediction algorithms, 145 miRNAs were predicted to target wheat genes, while 69 miRNAs were predicted to target fungal genes. We also confirmed reciprocal expression of TA078/miR399b and tae-miR9664 and their target genes in different treatments, providing evidence for miRNA-mediated regulation during infection. Both known and novel miRNAs were predicted to target fungal genes, suggesting trans-kingdom regulation of gene expression. Overall, this study contributes to the current repository of wheat miRNAs and provides novel information on the yet-uncharacterized roles for miRNAs in the wheat-stripe rust pathosystem."

"28550063","abstracttext","In our endeavor to improve the nitrogen fixation efficiency of a soil diazotroph that would be unaffected by synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers, we have deleted a part of the negative regulatory gene nifL and constitutively expressed the positive regulatory gene nifA in the chromosome of Azotobacter chroococcum CBD15, a strain isolated from the local field soil. No antibiotic resistance gene or other foreign gene was present in the chromosome of the engineered strain. Wheat seeds inoculated with this engineered strain, which we have named Azotobacter chroococcum HKD15, were tested for 3 years in pots and 1 year in the field. The yield of wheat was enhanced by ∼60% due to inoculation of seeds by A. chroococcum HKD15 in the absence of any urea application. Ammonium only marginally affected acetylene reduction by the engineered Azotobacter strain. When urea was also applied, the same wheat yield could be sustained by using seeds inoculated with A. chroococcum HKD15 and using ∼85 kg less urea (∼40 kg less nitrogen) than the usual ∼257 kg urea (∼120 kg nitrogen) per hectare. Wheat plants arising from the seeds inoculated with the engineered Azotobacter strain exhibited far superior overall performance, had much higher dry weight and nitrogen content, and assimilated molecular 15 N much better. A nitrogen balance experiment also revealed much higher total nitrogen content. Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production by the wild type and that by the engineered strain were about the same. Inoculation of the wheat seeds with A. chroococcum HKD15 did not adversely affect the microbial population in the field rhizosphere soil. IMPORTANCE Application of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers is a standard agricultural practice to augment crop yield. Plants, however, utilize only a fraction of the applied fertilizers, while the unutilized fertilizers cause grave environmental problems. Wild-type soil diazotrophic microorganisms cannot replace synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers, as these reduce atmospheric nitrogen very inefficiently and almost none at all in the presence of added nitrogenous fertilizers. If the nitrogen-fixing ability of soil diazotrophs could be improved and sustained even in the presence of synthetic nitrogenous fertilizers, then a mixture of the bacteria and a reduced quantity of chemical nitrogenous fertilizers could be employed to obtain the same grain yield but at a much-reduced environmental cost. The engineered Azotobacter strain that we have reported here has considerably enhanced nitrogen fixation and excretion abilities and can replace ∼85 kg of urea per hectare but sustain the same wheat yield, if the seeds are inoculated with it before sowing."

The uidA and neo genes were supplied on two separate plasmids (co-transformation) and 88% of the transgenic plants recovered expressed both genes. Southern analysis confirmed the results of histochemical GUS and NPT II assays. Transgenic plants were grown to maturity and flowered and set seed. Pollen from four T0 GUS+ plants analysed showed GUS activity and T1 seedlings derived from one of the transgenic plants showed a segregation of 2.75:1 (GUS+:GUS-) for uidA gene activity."

"15499400","abstracttext","The genomic content of the subtelomeric repeated sequences Spelt1 and Spelt52 was studied by dot, Southern, and in situ hybridization in 11 newly synthesized amphiploids of Aegilops and Triticum, and data were compared with the parental plants. Spelt1 had reduced copy numbers in the first generation of three synthetic amphiploids, but two others did not change; Spelt52 was amplified in nine amphiploids and did not change in two. In the second allopolyploid generation, Spelt1 copy number did not change, whereas there was amplification of Spelt52 in some allopolyploids and decreases in others. Neither allopolyploidy level nor the direction of the cross affected the patterns of change in the newly synthesized amphiploids. Changes did not result from intergenomic recombination because similar alterations were noticed in allopolyploids with and without Ph1, a gene that suppresses homoeologous pairing. No differences in Spelt1 and Spelt52 tandem organization were found by Southern hybridization. The significance of these data are discussed in relation to the establishment of newly formed allopolyploids."

Here we report the construction and characterization of arrayed large-insert libraries in a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) vector, one for each of these diploid species. The libraries are equivalent to 3.7, 5.4 and 4.1 of the T. urartu, Ae. speltoides, Ae. tauschii genomes, respectively. The predicted levels of genome coverage were confirmed by library hybridization with single-copy genes. The libraries were used to estimate the proportion of known repeated nucleotide sequences and gene content in each genome by BAC-end sequencing. Repeated sequence families previously detected in Triticeae accounted for 57, 61 and 57% of the T. urartu, Ae. speltoides and Ae. tauschii genomes, and coding regions accounted for 5.8, 4.5 and 4.8%, respectively."

"20237753","abstracttext","Long terminal repeat retrotransposons are the most abundant mobile elements in the plant genome and play an important role in the genome reorganization induced by environmental challenges. Their success depends on the ability of their promoters to respond to different signaling pathways that regulate plant adaptation to biotic and abiotic stresses. We have isolated a new Ty1-copia-like retrotransposon, named Ttd1a from the Triticum durum L. genome. To get insight into stress activation pathways in Ttd1a, we investigated the effect of salt and light stresses by RT-PCR and S-SAP profiling. We screened for Ttd1a insertion polymorphisms in plants grown to stress and showed that one new insertion was located near the resistance gene. Our analysis showed that the activation and mobilization of Ttd1a was controlled by salt and light stresses, which strengthened the hypothesis that stress mobilization of this element might play a role in the defense response to environmental stresses."

"22706402","abstracttext","Capillary electrophoresis (CE) is a powerful analytical tool that is widely applied to the analysis of biological samples. Proteins, peptides, nonprotein amino acids, phenolic compounds, and ions can be analysed using this electrophoretic methodology. This review summarises some applications of CE to the evaluation and characterisation of plant genetic resources of both Triticum and legume species, as carried out at the Istituto di Genetica Vegetale, National Research Council (IGV-CNR) in Bari (Italy). Different protein fractions as well as nonprotein amino acids were investigated by capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE), the most user-friendly mode of CE application. The described case studies show that CZE can be applied to some institutional activities of gene banks such as the evaluation of genetic diversity within stored collections, the acquisition of new samples, the differentiation of species belonging to the same genus, the identification of misclassified accessions, and the measurement of compounds relevant to nutrition or health."

"24170051","abstracttext","The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) organization of primary hexaploid cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) triticale regenerants containing Triticum timopheevi cytoplasm was analysed by hybridization experiments and compared with the mitochondrial genome organization of the corresponding regenerants with maintainer cytoplasm. Callus cultures had been derived from immature embryos, and 623 triticale plants were regenerated via somatic embryogenesis after three to four subcultures. The chondriome of 159 regenerants was investigated with regard to somaclonal variation. Six different mitochondrial gene probes and four different restriction enzymes were used for Southern blot analyses by the non-radioactive digoxigenin labeling technique. Alloplasmic regenerants showed a gain or loss of hybridization signals up to a high percentage, while euplasmic ones revealed only minor variability with respect to band stoichiometries. In 24 cases rearrangements in the mtDNA were proved. We suppose that recombination processes and selective amplification events are responsible for these findings."

"24264821","abstracttext","The chromosomes of the tetraploid wheats Triticum timopheevi (Genome AAGG) and T. araraticum (Genome AAGG) were C-banded at mitosis. The identity of the banded and unbanded chromosomes was then established by firstly making comparisons with the hexaploid species T. zhukovskyi which has the genome formula AAAAGG. Secondly, the meiotic pairing in F1 hybrids between T. timopheevi and diploid wheats was examined by means of C-banding. The results showed that the banded chromosomes belonged to the G genome, while the unbanded chromosomes belonged to the A genome. Only one of the two pairs of satellited chromosomes had strong heterochromatic bands. The relationship between the genomes of T. timopheevi and T. dicoccum (Genome AABB) was then assessed at meiosis in hybrids between these species, using the techniques of C-banding and in situ hybridisation of a cloned ribosomal RNA gene probe. It was concluded that there were differences both in the amount and distribution of heterochromatin and also translocation differences between the species."

"2152160","abstracttext","Genes encoding high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin, a wheat seed storage protein, are expressed only in the developing endosperm. It was previously demonstrated that sequences essential for endosperm-specific transcription reside within 436 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon for HMW glutenin translation. We have further analyzed this region by testing the ability of a series of truncated HMW glutenin promoter fragments to enhance transcription from an adjacent heterologous promoter. The activity of these hybrid promoters was determined by measuring the expression of a linked beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in transgenic tobacco plants. An HMW glutenin promoter fragment spanning nucleotides -375 to -45 relative to the transcription start site was found to stimulate GUS expression in tobacco seeds when inserted in either orientation upstream of the heterologous promoter. Furthermore, this fragment could also potentiate transcription when located 3' to the GUS reporter gene. Stimulation of GUS gene expression in transgenic tobacco seeds did not occur until 9 days to 12 days after anthesis, coincident with the onset of storage protein synthesis in the developing tobacco and wheat seed, and was confined to the endosperm tissue. By testing progressively shorter promoter fragments, the enhancer element responsible for this pattern of expression was localized to a 40-base pair region some 170 base pairs upstream of the start site for HMW glutenin transcription."
"1822995","articletitle","Maize rbcS promoter activity depends on sequence elements not found in dicot rbcS promoters."
"1822995","abstracttext","Although the molecular mechanisms of dicot photosynthetic gene regulation have been pursued actively, comparable studies of monocot regulation have been slow to come forth. We show here that monocot (maize and wheat) but not dicot (pea, tobacco, and Arabidopsis) ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit (rbcS) gene promoters are active in maize mesophyll protoplasts. The evolutionarily conserved GT and G boxes of dicot rbcS promoters are not essential for light-responsive expression in monocot leaf cells. Instead, at least six constitutive and light-sensitive regulatory elements are likely important for maize rbcS expression. Synergism between upstream and downstream promoter elements is required. Whereas in dicots, light triggers coupled leaf development and photosynthetic gene expression, in monocots, light regulation of rbcS is uncoupled from leaf development. Light regulation of maize rbcS may be divided into direct and indirect contributions mediated by different regulatory elements. Because wheat and maize rbcS promoters show sequence homologies and similar expression patterns in monocot and dicot leaf cells, it appears likely that monocots share conserved regulatory elements irrespective of whether they utilize the C3 or C4 pathway for carbon fixation."

"1712098","abstracttext","The wheat mitochondrial (mt) NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene (nad4) has been localized and sequenced. This gene, about 8 kb long, is composed of four exons separated by three class II introns. The nad4 gene exists as a single copy in the wheat mitochondrial genome and it is transcribed into one abundant mRNA of 1.8 kb, whose extremities have been mapped. The complete cDNA sequence corresponding to the nad4 transcript has been determined by combining the direct sequencing of uncloned cDNA and a method involving cDNA synthesis and PCR amplification using specific oligonucleotides as primers, followed by cloning and sequencing of the amplification product. Comparison of the genomic sequence with that of the cDNA shows that all nad4 transcripts are fully edited at 23 positions, with an uneven distribution of the editing sites between the different exons: While exon 1 and exon 4 are extensively edited (with a change of 11% of the amino acid sequence), exon 2 is not edited at all and exon 3 is 0.5% edited. This uneven distribution is discussed."

"3311887","abstracttext","A vector was constructed that directs the expression of foreign genes in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This vector contains an expression site that was constructed by in vitro modification of the iso-1-cytochrome c (CYC1) gene of S. cerevisiae. The expression of heterologous sequences can be experimentally controlled by catabolite control sequences, promoter and transcription initiation sequences and termination sequence derived from the CYC1 gene. A portion of a genomic wheat alpha-gliadin gene consisting of the entire 861 bp of protein-coding sequence, 18 bp of 5' leader sequence and 54 bp of 3'-noncoding sequence was inserted into the expression site. A CYC1::alpha-gliadin transcript of approx. 1050 nucleotides was synthesized in transformed yeast under the control of the CYC1 regulatory region. The transcripts terminated within the alpha-gliadin 3'-noncoding region, near a nucleotide sequence similar to the yeast transcription termination consensus sequence. The alpha-gliadin was immunochemically detected in total protein extracts from transformed cells and accounted for approx. 0.1% of the total cellular protein. The size of alpha-gliadin synthesized in yeast is the same as that of mature wheat alpha-gliadin. This is consistent with recognition and cleavage of the signal peptide by yeast. Due to the amino acid composition of alpha-gliadin, the availability of glutamine tRNA is a potential translational limitation to high-level synthesis in yeast."
"8589414","articletitle","Reduced virulence of Gibberella zeae caused by disruption of a trichothecene toxin biosynthetic gene."
"8589414","abstracttext","The production of trichothecene mycotoxins by some plant pathogenic species of Fusarium is thought to contribute to their virulence. Gibberella zeae (F. graminearum) is an important cereal pathogen that produces the trichothecene deoxynivalenol. To determine if trichothecene production contributes to the virulence of G. zeae, we generated trichothecene-deficient mutants of the fungus by gene disruption. The disrupted gene, Tri5, encodes the enzyme trichodiene synthase, which catalyzes the first step in trichothecene biosynthesis. To disrupt Tri5, G. zeae was transformed with a plasmid carrying a doubly truncated copy of the Tri5 coding region interrupted by a hygromycin B resistance gene. Tri5- transformants were selected by screening for the inability to produce trichothecenes and by Southern blot analysis. Tri5- strains exhibited reduced virulence on seedlings of Wheaton wheat and common winter rye, but wild-type virulence on seedlings of Golden Bantam maize. On Caldwell and Marshall wheat and Porter oat seedlings, Tri5- strains were inconsistent in causing less disease than their wild-type progenitor strain. Head blight developed more slowly on Wheaton when inoculated with Tri5- mutants than when inoculated with wild-type strains. These results suggest that trichothecene production contributes to the virulence of G. zeae on some hosts."

"8190077","abstracttext","The mitochondrial gene coding for subunit 4 of the NADH dehydrogenase complex I (nad4) has been isolated and characterized from lettuce, Lactuca sativa. Analysis of nad4 genes in a number of plants by Southern hybridization had previously suggested that the intron content varied between species. Characterization of the lettuce gene confirms this observation. Lettuce nad4 contains two exons and one group IIA intron, whereas previously sequenced nad4 genes from turnip and wheat contain three group IIA introns. Northern analysis identified a transcript of 1600 nucleotides, which represents the mature nad4 mRNA and a primary transcript of 3200 nucleotides. Sequence analysis of lettuce and turnip nad4 cDNAs was used to confirm the intron/exon border sequences and to examine RNA editing patterns. Editing is observed at the 5' and 3' ends of the lettuce transcript, but is absent from sequences that correspond to exons two, three and the 5' end of exon four in turnip and wheat. In contrast, turnip transcripts are highly edited in this region, suggesting that homologous recombination of an edited and spliced cDNA intermediate was involved in the loss of introns two and three from an ancestral lettuce nad4 gene."

"9276939","abstracttext","A full length cDNA clone encoding the 447 amino acid long barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Bomi) endosperm elongation factor 1 alpha (eF-1 alpha) was isolated by a differential screening procedure. RFLP mapping of eF-1 alpha showed that the barley genome contains a small eF-1 alpha gene family of 4 copies, with 1 copy of the gene being located on each of chromosomes 2, 4, 6, and 7. Analysis of barley endosperm total proteins by Western blot with antibodies directed towards wheat eF-1 alpha and the sea urchin 51 kDa proteins gave a single band of the expected molecular weight. Amino acid sequence comparison with other plant eF-1 alpha sequences showed that the isolated barley endosperm eF-1 alpha is more similar to the published wheat eF-1 alpha sequence than to eF-1 alpha sequences previously published for the barley cultivars Igri and Dicktoo. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the barley eF-1 alpha gene family can be divided into two subfamilies and that two ancestral genes existed before the divergence of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants."
"9799271","articletitle","Effect of the pairing gene Ph1 and premeiotic colchicine treatment on intra- and interchromosome pairing of isochromosomes in common wheat."
"9799271","abstracttext","The analysis of the pattern of isochromosome pairing allows one to distinguish factors affecting presynaptic alignment of homologous chromosomes from those affecting synapsis and crossing-over. Because the two homologous arms in an isochromosome are invariably associated by a common centromere, the suppression of pairing between these arms (intrachromosome pairing) would indicate that synaptic or postsynaptic events were impaired. In contrast, the suppression of pairing between an isochromosome and its homologous chromosome (interchromosome pairing), without affecting intrachromosome pairing, would suggest that homologous presynaptic alignment was impaired. We used such an isochromosome system to determine which of the processes associated with chromosome pairing was affected by the Ph1 gene of common wheat-the main gene that restricts pairing to homologues. Ph1 reduced the frequency of interchromosome pairing without affecting intrachromosome pairing. In contrast, intrachromosome pairing was strongly reduced in the absence of the synaptic gene Syn-B1. Premeiotic colchicine treatment, which drastically decreased pairing of conventional chromosomes, reduced interchromosome but not intrachromosome pairing. The results support the hypothesis that premeiotic alignment is a necessary stage for the regularity of meiotic pairing and that Ph1 relaxes this alignment. We suggest that Ph1 acts on premeiotic alignment of homologues and homeologues as a means of ensuring diploid-like meiotic behavior in polyploid wheat."

"9548987","abstracttext","Expression of the acidic dehydrin gene wcor410 was found to be associated with the development of freezing tolerance in several Gramineae species. This gene is part of a family of three homologous members, wcor410, wcor410b, and wcor410c, that have been mapped to the long arms of the homologous group 6 chromosomes of hexaploid wheat. To gain insight into the function of this gene family, antibodies were raised against the WCOR410 protein and affinity purified to eliminate cross-reactivity with the WCS120 dehydrin-like protein of wheat. Protein gel blot analyses showed that the accumulation of WCOR410 proteins correlates well with the capacity of each cultivar to cold acclimate and develop freezing tolerance. Immunoelectron microscope analyses revealed that these proteins accumulate in the vicinity of the plasma membrane of cells in the sensitive vascular transition area where freeze-induced dehydration is likely to be more severe. Biochemical fractionation experiments indicated that WCOR410 is a peripheral protein and not an integral membrane protein. These results provide direct evidence that a subtype of the dehydrin family accumulates near the plasma membrane. The properties, abundance, and localization of these proteins suggest that they are involved in the cryoprotection of the plasma membrane against freezing or dehydration stress. We propose that WCOR410 plays a role in preventing the destabilization of the plasma membrane that occurs during dehydrative conditions."

"11204778","abstracttext","A Mycosphaerella graminicola strain transformed with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) downstream of either a carbon source-repressed promoter or a constitutive promoter was used to investigate in situ carbohydrate uptake during penetration of the fungus in wheat leaves. The promoter region of the acu-3 gene from Neurospora crassa encoding isocitrate lyase was used as a carbon source-repressed promoter. The promoter region of the Aspergillus nidulans gpdA gene encoding glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a constitutive promoter. Fluorometric measurement of GFP gene expression in liquid cultures of acu-3-regulated transformants indicated that the N. crassa acu-3 promoter functions in M. graminicola as it does in N. crassa, i.e., acetate induced and carbon source repressed. Glucose, fructose, and saccharose triggered the repression, whereas mannitol, xylose, and cell wall polysaccharides did not. Monitoring the GFP level during fungal infection of wheat leaves revealed that acu-3 promoter repression occurred after penetration until sporulation, when newly differentiated pycnidiospores fluoresced. The use of GFP transformants also allowed clear visualization of M. graminicola pathogenesis. No appressoria were formed, but penetration at cell junctions was observed. These results give new insight into the biotrophic status of M. graminicola."

"10598101","abstracttext","In addition to the bZIP protein Opaque2 (O2), there are other maize endosperm nuclear proteins that recognize the O2 box in 22 kDa zein gene promoters. In an effort to understand the effect of these factors on 22 kDa zein expression, we have cloned one of these and identified it as the putative maize (Zea mays L.) orthologue of the wheat bZIP protein EmBP-1 (mEmBP-1). The mEmBP-1 protein exhibits 52% sequence identity and 68% similarity with the wheat protein and recognizes a similar spectrum of DNA sequences, albeit with slightly altered specificity. The mEmBP-1 gene exists as duplicate loci in maize on chromosomes 7S (mEmBP-1a) and 2L (mEmBP-1b). The mEmBP-1 genes are expressed in endosperm, embryo, immature ears, tassel, roots, and seedling shoots at low levels. Although mEmBP-1 binds to the O2 box from the 22 kDa zein gene promoter as a homodimer, it is unable to heterodimerize with O2. The mEmBP-1 protein can activate transcription from a truncated promoter containing a pentamer of the O2 site in yeast cells; however, it inhibited regulated transcription of a 22 kDa zein promoter in a transient expression assay using cultured maize endosperm cells."

"12471446","abstracttext","Genes from the SNF2 family play important roles in transcriptional regulation, maintenance of chromosome integrity and DNA repair. This study describes the molecular cloning and characterization of cereal genes from this family. The predicted proteins exhibit a novel C-terminal domain that defines a new subfamily designated SNF2P that includes human and mouse proteins. Comparison between genomic and cDNA sequences showed that cereal Snf2P genes consisted of 17 exons, including one only 8 bp long. Two barley alleles differed by the presence of a 7.7-kb non-LTR retrotransposon in intron 6. An alternative annotation of the orthologous Arabidopsis gene would improve its similarity with the other members of the subfamily. Intron 2 was not spliced out in approximately half of the rice Snf2P mRNAs present in leaves, resulting in a premature stop codon. Transcripts from the barley and wheat Snf2P genes were found in apexes, leaves, sheaths, roots and spikes. The Snf2P genes exist as single copies on wheat chromosome arm 5A(m)L and in the colinear regions on barley chromosome arm 4HL and rice chromosome 3. High-density genetic mapping and RT-PCR suggest that Snf2P is not a candidate gene for the tightly linked vernalization gene Vrn2."

"12423017","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is an important pathogen of small grains and maize in many areas of the world. Infected grains are often contaminated with mycotoxins harmful to humans and animals. During the past decade, F. graminearum has caused several severe epidemics of head scab in wheat and barley. In order to understand molecular mechanisms regulating fungal development and pathogenicity in this pathogen, we isolated and characterized a MAP kinase gene, MGV1, which is highly homologous to the MPS1 gene in Magnaporthe grisea. The MGV1 gene was dispensable for conidiation in F. graminearum but essential for female fertility during sexual reproduction. Vegetative growth of mgv1 deletion mutants was normal in liquid media but reduced on solid media. Mycelia of the mgv1 mutants had weak cell walls and were hypersensitive to cell wall degrading enzymes. Interestingly, the mgv1 mutants were self-incompatible when tested for heterokaryon formation, and their virulence was substantially reduced. The ability of the mutants to accumulate trichothecene mycotoxins on inoculated wheat was also greatly reduced. Our data suggest that MGV1 in F. graminearum is involved in multiple developmental processes related to sexual reproduction, plant infection, and cell wall integrity."

"11962634","abstracttext","Extended flanking DNA sequences were characterized for five members of the wheat high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin gene family to understand more of the structure, control, and evolution of these genes. Analysis revealed more sequence conservation among orthologous regions than between paralogous regions, with differences mainly owing to transposition events involving putative retrotransposons and several miniature inverted transposable elements (MITEs). Both gyspy-like long terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposon sequences are represented in the flanking DNAs. One of the MITEs is a novel class, but another MITE is related to the maize Stowaway family and is widely represented in Triticeae express sequence tags (ESTs). Flanking DNA of the longest sequence, a 20 425-bp fragment including and surrounding the HMW-glutenin Bx7 gene, showed additional cereal gene-like sequences both immediately 5' and 3' to the HMW-glutenin coding region. The transcriptional activities of sequences related to these flanking putative genes and the retrotransposon-related regions were indicated by matches to wheat and other Triticeae ESTs. Predictive analysis of matrix-attachment regions (MARs) of the HMW glutenin and several alpha-, gamma-, and omega-gliadin flanking DNAs indicate potential MARs immediately flanking each of the genes. Matrix binding activity in the predicted regions was confirmed for two of the HMW-glutenin genes."
"12684018","articletitle","The global genetic structure of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola is characterized by high nuclear diversity, low mitochondrial diversity, regular recombination, and gene flow."
"12684018","abstracttext","A total of 1673 Mycosphaerella graminicola strains were assayed for DNA fingerprints and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers in the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes. The isolates were collected from 17 wheat fields located in 11 countries on five continents over a six year period (1989-1995). Our results indicate that genetic diversity in the nuclear genome of this fungus was high for all but three of the field populations surveyed and that populations sampled from different continents had similar frequencies for the most common RFLP alleles. Hierarchical analysis revealed that more than 90% of global gene diversity was distributed within a wheat field, while approximately 5% of gene diversity was distributed among fields within regions and approximately 3% was distributed among regions on different continents. These findings suggest that gene flow has occurred on a global scale. On average, each leaf was colonized by a different nuclear genotype. In contrast, only seven mtDNA haplotypes were detected among the 1673 isolates and the two most common mtDNA haplotypes represented approximately 93% of the world population, consistent with a selective sweep. Analysis of multilocus associations indicated that all field populations were in gametic equilibrium, suggesting that sexual recombination is a regular occurrence globally."
"18058177","articletitle","Gene expression of different wheat genotypes during attack by virulent and avirulent Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) larvae."
"18058177","abstracttext","Wheat and its relatives possess a number of resistance (R) genes specific for the Hessian fly (HF) [Mayetiola destructor (Say)]. HF populations overcome R gene resistance by evolving virulence. Virulent HF larvae manipulate the plant to produce a nutritionally enhanced feeding tissue and, probably, also suppress plant defense responses. Using two wheat R genes, H9 and H13, and three HF strains (biotypes) differing in virulence for H9 and H13, we conducted a genome-wide transcriptional analysis of gene expression during compatible interactions with virulent larvae and incompatible interactions with avirulent larvae. During both types of interactions, a large number of genes (>1,000) showed alterations in gene expression. Analysis of genes with known functions revealed that major targets for differential regulation were genes that encoded defense proteins or enzymes involved in the phenylpropanoid, cell wall, and lipid metabolism pathways. A combination of the enhancement of antibiosis defense, the evasion of nutrient metabolism induction, and the fortification and expansion of the cell wall are likely the collective mechanism for host-plant resistance observed during incompatible interactions. To overcome this resistance, virulent larvae appeared to suppress antibiosis defense while inducing nutrient metabolism, weakening cell wall, and inhibiting plant growth."

"18470167","abstracttext","Gametocidal (Gc) genes in Aegilops species are known to cause gamete abortion and chromosome breakage when they are introduced into the wheat genetic background. Interactions of five Gc genes so far identified were investigated by analysis of wheat hybrids among lines carrying different gametocidal genes. As a result, the genes were classified into three functional groups. The first group includes two Gc genes of Ae. speltoides (Gc1a and Gc1b) and one gene (Gc-Sl3) on chromosome 2S1 of Ae. sharonensis. These genes were hypostatic to the genes (Gc-Sl1, Gc-Sl2) on chromosome 4S1 of Ae. longissima and Ae. sharonensis, which constitute the second group. In addition, plants carrying Gc genes of both the first and the second group produced progeny with higher frequencies of chromosome breakage than those found in the progeny of single gene carriers. It was concluded that there were specific interactions between these genes to enhance chromosome breakage. On the other hand, there was no interaction between the Gc gene (Gc-C) of Ae. triuncialis, the third group, and Gc genes belonging to the former two groups. These functional groups might be a reflection of the mechanisms by which Gc genes induce gamete abortion and chromosome breakage. Based on functional and local relationships, the symbols of the Gc genes were systematically redesignated."

"15292990","abstracttext","Tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), is an economically important foliar disease in the major wheat growing areas of the world. Multiple races of the pathogen have been characterized based on their ability to cause necrosis and/or chlorosis in differential wheat lines. Isolates of race 5 cause chlorosis only, and they produce a host-selective toxin designated Ptr ToxB that induces chlorosis when infiltrated into sensitive genotypes. The international Triticeae mapping initiative (ITMI) mapping population was used to identify genomic regions harboring QTLs for resistance to fungal inoculations of Ptr race 5 and to determine the chromosomal location of the gene conditioning sensitivity to Ptr ToxB. The toxin-insensitivity gene, which we are designating tsc2, mapped to the distal tip of the short arm of chromosome 2B. This gene was responsible for the effects of a major QTL associated with resistance to the race 5 fungus and accounted for 69% of the phenotypic variation. Additional minor QTLs were identified on the short arm of 2A, the long arm of 4A, and on the long arm of chromosome 2B. Together, the major QTL on 2BS identified by tsc2 and the QTL on 4AL explained 73% of the total phenotypic variation for resistance to Ptr race 5. The results of this research indicate that Ptr ToxB is a major virulence factor, and the markers closely linked to tsc2 and the 4A QTL should be useful for introgression of resistance into adapted germplasm."

In at least one case, a single transformation event gave rise to T(1) plants with different degrees of dwarfism, the phenotypes being stably inherited over at least four generations. The dwarf phenotype, which included dark-green leaves, increased tillering and, in severe cases, a prostrate growth habit, was replicated by the application of a GA biosynthesis inhibitor to the wild type. Ear rachis length, grain set, and grain size were also decreased in the wheat transformants, compared with an azygous (null) line. The extent of post-germination alpha-amylase production in grains reflected the severity of the shoot phenotype of the transformants and both developmental processes were restored to normal by the application of gibberellic acid (GA(3)). Expression of two GA biosynthesis genes (TaGA20ox1 and TaGA3ox2) was up-regulated, and that of two alpha-amylase gene families (alpha-Amy1 and alpha-Amy2) down regulated, in scutella of semi-dwarf lines, compared with controls. The marked decline in transcript abundance of both alpha-amylase gene families in aleurone was associated with a decreased content of bioactive GAs in grains of the semi-dwarf lines."
"17623742","articletitle","Overexpression of TaVRN1 in Arabidopsis promotes early flowering and alters development."
"17623742","abstracttext","TaVRN1, a member of the APETALA1 (AP1) subfamily of MADS-box transcription factors, is a key gene that controls transition from vegetative to reproductive phase in wheat. The accumulation of TaVRN1 transcripts in winter wheat probably requires the down-regulation of TaVRT2, a MADS-box factor that binds and represses the TaVRN1 promoter, and of the flowering repressor TaVRN2. However, the molecular mechanisms by which TaVRN1 functions as an activator of phase transition is unknown. To address this, a combination of gene expression and functional studies was used. RNA in situ hybridization studies showed that TaVRN1 transcripts accumulate in all meristems and primordia associated with flower development. An interaction screen in yeast revealed that TaVRN1 interacts with several proteins involved in different processes of plant development such as transcription factors, kinases and a cyclophilin. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaVRN1 flower early and show various levels of modified plant architecture. The ectopic expression causes an overexpression of the AP1 and MAX4 genes, which are associated with flowering and auxin regulation, respectively. The induction of gene expression probably results from the binding of TaVRN1 to CArG motifs present on the AP1 and MAX4 promoters. In contrast, Arabidopsis plants that overexpress TaVRT2, which encodes a putative flowering repressor, show an opposite late flowering phenotype. Together, the data provide molecular evidence that TaVRN1 may have pleiotropic effects in various processes such as control of axillary bud growth, transition to flowering and development of floral organs."

"19953127","abstracttext","A high-throughput two-step PCR strategy for the identification of selected genes from a BAC library derived from hexaploid wheat (16,974 Mbp) is described. The screen is based on the pooling of DNA from BAC clones into 675 ""superpools"" arrayed in a three-dimensional configuration. Each BAC clone is represented in three superpools to allow the identification of candidate 384-well plates of clones after the first round of PCR; identification is facilitated by an associated Perl script. A second round of PCR detects the specific BAC clone within the candidate plate that corresponds to the gene of interest. Thus, a single copy of the target gene can be identified from the library of over 700,000 clones (approximately 5 genome equivalents) by assaying only three 384-well plates. The pooling strategy was validated by screening the library with primers specific for the reduced height (Rht-1a) gene. Using relatively stringent selection criteria, 13 Rht-containing clones were identified from 17 candidate plates, and sequence analysis of the amplified products showed that all three Rht homoeologues were represented. Furthermore, the method confirmed the estimated coverage of the BAC library. Thus, this methodology allows the rapid and cost-effective identification of genes, and their homoeologues, from large-insert libraries of complex genomes such as hexaploid wheat."

"20360266","abstracttext","Gene expression after leaf rust infection was compared in near-isogenic wheat lines differing in the Lr10 leaf rust resistance gene. RNA from susceptible and resistant plants was used for cDNA library construction. In total, 55 008 ESTs were sequenced from the two libraries, then combined and assembled into 14 268 unigenes for further analysis. Of these ESTs, 89% encoded proteins similar to (E value of < or =10(-5)) characterized or annotated proteins from the NCBI non-redundant database representing diverse molecular functions, cellular localization and biological processes based on gene ontology classification. Further, the unigenes were classified into susceptible and resistant classes based on the EST members assembled from the respective libraries. Several genes from the resistant sample (14-3-3 protein, wali5 protein, actin-depolymerization factor and ADP-ribosylation factor) and the susceptible sample (brown plant hopper resistance protein, caffeic acid O-methyltransferase, pathogenesis-related protein and senescence-associated protein) were selected and their differential expression in the resistant and susceptible samples collected at different time points after leaf rust infection was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. The molecular pathogenicity of leaf rust in wheat was studied and the EST data generated made a foundation for future studies."

"22736109","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina, is the most devastating disease of wheat worldwide, which sometimes becomes epidemic. The pathogen evolves into new strains, making its control difficult. Though more than 60 leaf rust resistant genes are now known, only limited insight is available into the molecular mechanism involved in this host pathogen interaction. In the present study, quantitative real-time PCR based differential gene expression profiling was examined for five target genes encoding for chitinase3, β-1,3/1,4 glucanase, thaumatin-like protein, peroxidase2 and mitogen activated protein kinase1 to unravel their coordinated action during compatible and incompatible interaction, to inhibit the pathogen progression and to identify the time-period of maximum defense activity. Spatio-temporal expression profiling suggested that the maximum defense activity occurred at 12-24 hours post inoculation, whereas the state of infection and degree of resistance was predicted using coordinated unique expression signatures of target genes. The significant differences of targeted gene expression between resistant mock inoculated, resistant infected and susceptible infected plants were evaluated using t test at significance level of p < 0.01. The differences occurred can be attributed to the presence of seedling leaf rust resistance Lr28 gene, which facilitated prevention of leaf rust infection in resistant wheat plants."

"23527011","abstracttext","Expression of the wheat dehydrin gene Cor410b is induced several fold above its non-stressed levels upon exposure to stresses such as cold, drought and wounding. Deletion analysis of the TdCor410b promoter revealed a single functional C-repeat (CRT) element. Seven transcription factors (TFs) were shown to bind to this CRT element using yeast one-hybrid screens of wheat and barley cDNA libraries, of which only one belonged to the DREB class of TFs. The remaining six encoded ethylene response factors (ERFs) belong to three separate subfamilies. Analysis of binding selectivity of these TFs indicated that all seven could bind to the CRT element (GCCGAC), and that three of the six ERFs could bind both to the CRT element and the ethylene-responsive GCC-box (GCCGCC). The TaERF4 subfamily members specifically bound the CRT element, and did not bind either the GCC-box or DRE element (ACCGAC). Molecular modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified a single residue Pro42 in the Apetala2 (AP2) domain of TaERF4-like proteins that is conserved in monocotyledonous plants and is responsible for the recognition selectivity of this subfamily. We suggest that both DREB and ERF proteins regulate expression of the Cor410b gene through a single, critical CRT element. Members of the TaERF4 subfamily are specific, positive regulators of Cor410b gene expression."

"22967144","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a serious yield-limiting factor for wheat production worldwide. The objective of this study was to identify and map a stripe rust resistance gene in wheat line Shaannong 104 using SSR markers. F(1), F(2) and F(3) populations from Shaannong 104/Mingxian 169 were inoculated with Chinese Pst race CYR32 in a greenhouse. Shaannong 104 carried a single dominant gene, YrSN104. Six potential polymorphic SSR markers identified in bulk segregant analysis were used to genotype F(2) and F(3) families. YrSN104 was closely linked with all six SSR markers on chromosome 1BS with genetic distances of 2.0 cM (Xgwm18, Xgwm273, Xbarc187), 2.6 cM (Xgwm11, Xbarc137) and 5.9 cM (Xbarc240). Pedigree analysis, pathogenicity tests using 26 Pst races, haplotyping of associated markers on isogenic lines carrying known stripe rust resistance genes, and associations with markers suggested that YrSN104 was a new resistance gene or an allele at the Yr24/Yr26 locus on chromosome 1BS. Deployment of YrSN104 singly or in combination to elite genotypes could play an effective role to lessen yield losses caused by stripe rust."

"21623954","abstracttext","The ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola is the causal agent of Septoria Tritici Blotch disease of wheat and can grow as yeast-like cells or as hyphae depending on environmental conditions. Hyphal growth is however essential for successful leaf infection. A T-DNA mutagenesis screen performed on haploid spores identified a mutant, which can undergo yeast-like growth but cannot switch to hyphal growth. For this reason the mutant was non-pathogenic towards wheat leaves. The gene affected, MgAlg2, encoded a homologue of Saccharomyces cerevisiae ScAlg2, an alpha-1,2-mannosyltransferase, which functions in the early stages of asparagine-linked protein (N-) glycosylation. Targeted gene deletion and complementation experiments confirmed that loss of MgAlg2 function prevented the developmental growth switch. MgAlg2 was able to functionally complement the S. cerevisiae ScAlg2-1 temperature sensitive growth phenotype. Spores of ΔMgAlg2 mutants were hypersensitive to the cell wall disrupting agent Calcofluor white and produced abnormally hypo-N-glycosylated proteins. Gene expression, proteome and glycoproteome analysis revealed that ΔMgAlg2 mutant spores show responses typically associated with the accumulation of mis-folded proteins. The data presented highlight key roles for protein N-glycosylation in regulating the switch to hyphal growth, possibly as a consequence of maintaining correct folding and localization of key proteins involved in this process."

"21645000","abstracttext","The RNA binding protein, flowering control locus A, (FCA) regulates flowering in rice and Arabidopsis. FCA interacts with FY to auto-regulate its own transcripts as well as to control flowering by downregulating flowering locus C (FLC). We report the cloning and characterization of the gamma (γ) isoform of FCA from barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. McLeod). The deduced protein contained two RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), a glycine-rich region at the N-terminal end, a polyglutamine region immediately downstream of a WW domain. Barley FCA had greater protein sequence homology to wheat and rice FCA than to its Arabidopsis homolog. In developing barley embryos, FCA transcripts could be detected from 2 days after pollination (DAP) up to 40 DAP. FCA transcript levels in mature barley embryo were more abundant in non-germinated than in germinated seeds, with the levels declining as germination progressed. ABA inhibition of germination inhibited the decline of barley embryo FCA. Transient co-expression of FCA or a truncated FCA (lacking RRM) with maize VP1 promoter or wheat Em gene promoter in barley aleurone protoplasts led to increased VP1 and Em gene promoter activity. Barley FCA or truncated FCA localized in the nucleus suggested its role in gene regulation."

"22140571","abstracttext","The velvet protein, VeA, is involved in the regulation of diverse cellular processes. In this study, we explored functions of FgVeA in the wheat head blight pathogen, Fusarium graminearum,using a gene replacement strategy. The FgVEA deletion mutant exhibited a reduction in aerial hyphae formation, hydrophobicity, and deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis. Deletion of FgVEA gene led to an increase in conidial production, but a delay in conidial germination. Pathogencity assays showed that the mutant was impaired in virulence on flowering wheat head. Sensitivity tests to various stresses exhibited that the FgVEA deletion mutant showed increased resistance to osmotic stress and cell wall-damaging agents, but increased sensitivity to iprodione and fludioxonil fungicides. Ultrastructural and histochemical analyses revealed that conidia of FgVeA deletion mutant contained an unusually high number of large lipid droplets, which is in agreement with the observation that the mutant accumulated a higher basal level of glycerol than the wild-type progenitor. Serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) in the FgVEA mutant confirmed that FgVeA was involved in various cellular processes. Additionally, six proteins interacting with FgVeA were identified by yeast two hybrid assays in current study. These results indicate that FgVeA plays a critical role in a variety of cellular processes in F. graminearum."

"23048128","abstracttext","The MYB-type proteins are involved in various processes of plant growth, development, and stress response. In a previous work, a polyethylene glycol (PEG) stress-induced gene, TaMYB30, which encodes a R2R3-type MYB protein was identified in wheat. In this study, the isolation and functional characterization of the TaMYB30 gene are reported. Three homologous sequences of TaMYB30 were isolated from hexaploid wheat and designated as TaMYB30-A, TaMYB30-B, and TaMYB30-D genes based on the localizations of these three sequences to chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D, respectively. The expression levels of these three genes were similar under PEG stress conditions, and TaMYB30-B was selected for further analysis. The TaMYB30-B protein was localized to the nucleus where it activated transcription. The detailed characterization of Arabidopsis transgenic plants that overexpress the TaMYB30-B gene revealed that the TaMYB30-B protein can improve drought stress tolerance during the germination and the seedling stages. It was also found that overexpression of TaMYB30-B resulted in altered expression levels of some drought stress-responsive genes and changes in several physiological indices, which allow plants to overcome adverse conditions. These results indicate that the TaMYB30-B protein plays important roles in plant stress tolerance, and modification of its expression may improve drought stress tolerance in crop plants."

"23028337","abstracttext","Comparative analyses of pathogen genomes provide new insights into how pathogens have evolved common and divergent virulence strategies to invade related plant species. Fusarium crown and root rots are important diseases of wheat and barley world-wide. In Australia, these diseases are primarily caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum. Comparative genomic analyses showed that the F. pseudograminearum genome encodes proteins that are present in other fungal pathogens of cereals but absent in non-cereal pathogens. In some cases, these cereal pathogen specific genes were also found in bacteria associated with plants. Phylogenetic analysis of selected F. pseudograminearum genes supported the hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer into diverse cereal pathogens. Two horizontally acquired genes with no previously known role in fungal pathogenesis were studied functionally via gene knockout methods and shown to significantly affect virulence of F. pseudograminearum on the cereal hosts wheat and barley. Our results indicate using comparative genomics to identify genes specific to pathogens of related hosts reveals novel virulence genes and illustrates the importance of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of plant infecting fungal pathogens."

"24166321","abstracttext","Comparative genetic mapping of rice and barley, both major crop species with extensive genetic resources, offers the possibility of uniting two well-established and characterized genetic systems. In the present study, we screened 229 molecular markers and utilized 110 polymorphic orthologous loci to construct comparative maps of the rice and barley genomes. While extensive chromosomal rearrangements, including inversions and intrachromosomal translocations, differentiate the rice and barley genomes, several syntenous chromosomes are evident. Indeed, several chromosomes and chromosome arms appear to share nearly identical gene content and gene order. Seventeen regions of conserved organization were detected, spanning 287 cM (24%) and 321 cM (31%) of the rice and barley genomes, respectively. The results also indicate that most (72%) of the single-copy sequences in barley are also single copy in rice, suggesting that the large barley genome arose by unequal crossing over and amplification of repetitive DNA sequences and not by the duplication of single-copy sequences. Combining these results with those previously reported for comparative analyses of rice and wheat identified nine putatively syntenous chromosomes among barley, wheat and rice. The high degree of gene-order conservation as detected by comparative mapping has astonishing implications for interpreting genetic information among species and for elucidating chromosome evolution and speciation."

The availability of R locus mutants which lack anthocyanin production in all tissues offers the possibility of studying cell lineage by introducing a chimeric Lc gene into defined cells and following cell autonomous anthocyanin production. For this purpose integrative and self-replicating Lc vectors were constructed. Integrative expression vectors contained the 2.4 kbp Lc cDNA with the entire 5' leader fused to the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter with and without the maize alcohol dehydrogenase 1 intron 1 or to the mesophyll specific phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase promoter of maize. To enhance expression and to circumvent the necessity of stable integration, extrachromosomally replicating and expressing wheat dwarf virus-Lc constructions were also designed. Both categories of expression vectors were tested in embryogenic callus-derived protoplasts of maize and were found to transactivate anthocyanin biosynthesis. Southern blot analysis indicated that the wheat dwarf virus-Lc constructions were replicating."

"24272633","abstracttext","In the course of isolating tRNA genes from wheat mtDNA, we have found the same tRNA(Pro) gene in two different Hind III restriction fragments, H-P1 (0.7 kbp) and H-P2 (1.7 kbp). Sequences immediately flanking these duplicate genes are closely related, although not identical; sequence comparisons suggest that multiple rearrangements have occurred in the vicinity of the H-P2 tRNA(Pro) gene, relative to the H-P1 version. The chimeric nature of H-P2 is emphasized by the presence of sequences that are also found upstream of the wheat mitochondrial 26S rRNA gene, as well as sequences derived from chloroplast DNA. Comparison of H-P2 with H-P1 plus upstream sequences provides some insight into possible molecular events that might have generated H-P2. In particular, such comparisons suggest a model in which the homologous sequences in H-P2 are seen to be derived from H-P1 plus upstream sequences as a result of an intragenomic, site-specific rearrangement event, followed by amplification of the product, its fixation in the mitochondrial genome, and subsequent sequence divergence (single base changes as well as insertions/deletions of up to 50 nucleotides). The results reported here implicate particular primary sequence motifs in certain of the rearrangements that characterize H-P2."

The allelic series of the wheat Pm3 gene conferring race-specific resistance against powdery mildew has been well characterized functionally, and recently the corresponding avirulence gene AvrPm3a/f triggering the specific recognition by Pm3a and Pm3f alleles was cloned. Here, we describe the genetic and molecular analysis of two additional Blumeria loci involved in the resistance mediated by the Pm3c and Pm3f alleles. We genetically identified the two loci and mapped at high resolution one locus involved in the avirulence towards both Pm3c and Pm3f. The single candidate gene Bcg1 was identified in a physical target interval of 26kb defined by flanking genetic markers. Bcg1 encodes a small secreted protein sharing structural homology with ribonucleases and belongs to a family of clustered putative effector genes under diversifying selection. We found a very good, but not complete, correlation of Bcg1 haplotypes with the phenotypes of natural isolates. Two mutants were generated that were affected in their phenotypes towards Pm3a and Pm3f but did not show any sequence polymorphism in Bcg1. Our results suggest that avirulence to Pm3 in Blumeria is determined by a complex network of genes, in which Bcg1 might have a central role as a modifier of the Pm3/AvrPm3 interactions."

"26108150","abstracttext","Insect pheromones offer potential for managing pests of crop plants. Volatility and instability are problems for deployment in agriculture but could be solved by expressing genes for the biosynthesis of pheromones in the crop plants. This has now been achieved by genetically engineering a hexaploid variety of wheat to release (E)-β-farnesene (Eβf), the alarm pheromone for many pest aphids, using a synthetic gene based on a sequence from peppermint with a plastid targeting amino acid sequence, with or without a gene for biosynthesis of the precursor farnesyl diphosphate. Pure Eβf was produced in stably transformed wheat lines with no other detectable phenotype but requiring targeting of the gene produced to the plastid. In laboratory behavioural assays, three species of cereal aphids were repelled and foraging was increased for a parasitic natural enemy. Although these studies show considerable potential for aphid control, field trials employing the single and double constructs showed no reduction in aphids or increase in parasitism. Insect numbers were low and climatic conditions erratic suggesting the need for further trials or a closer imitation, in the plant, of alarm pheromone release."

In this report, we demonstrate that this native strain secretes bacteriocins that inhibit growth of phytopathogenic strains of the genera Pseudomonas and Xanthomonas. An S-type pyocin gene was detected in the genome of strain SF39a and named pys. A non-polar pys::Km mutant was constructed. The bacteriocin production was impaired in this mutant. To identify genes involved in bacteriocin regulation, random transposon mutagenesis was carried out. A miniTn5Km1 mutant, called P. fluorescens SF39a-451, showed strongly reduced bacteriocin production. This phenotype was caused by inactivation of the ptsP gene which encodes a phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase (EI(Ntr)) of the nitrogen-related phosphotransferase system (PTS(Ntr)). In addition, this mutant showed a decrease in biofilm formation and protease production, and an increase in surface motility and pyoverdine production compared with the wild-type strain. Moreover, we investigated the ability of strain SF39a-451 to colonize the wheat rhizosphere under greenhouse conditions. Interestingly, the mutant was less competitive than the wild-type strain in the rhizosphere. To our knowledge, this study provides the first evidence of both the relevance of the ptsP gene in bacteriocin production and functional characterization of a pyocin S in P. fluorescens."

In this study, we employed multiple phenotypic and genetic approaches to investigate the nature and consequences of allotetraploidization between A- and S-subgenome of tetraploid wheat. Results showed that karyotype of the nascent allopolyploid plants (AT2) is stable but they showed clear novelty in multiple morphological traits which might have positively contributed to the initial establishment of the tetraploids. Further microarray-based transcriptome profiling and gene-specific cDNA-pyrosequencing have documented that transcriptome shock was exceptionally strong in AT2, but a substantial proportion of the induced expression changes was rapidly stabilized in early generations. Meanwhile, both additive and nonadditive expression genes showed extensive homeolog expression remodeling and which have led to the subgenome expression dominance in leaf and young inflorescence of AT2. Through comparing the homeolog-expressing patterns between synthetic and natural tetraploid wheats, it appears that the shock-induced expression changes at both the total expression level and subgenome homeolog partitioning are evolutionarily persistent. Together, our study shed new light on how gene expression changes have rapidly occurred at the initial stage following allotetraploidization, as well as their evolutionary relevance, which may have implications for wheat improvements."

"27488925","abstracttext","Cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) catalyzes a key reaction in glycolysis and encoded by a multi-gene family which showed instability expression under abiotic stress. DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification that plays an important role in gene regulation in response to abiotic stress. The comprehension of DNA methylation at promoter region of TaGAPC1 can provide insights into the transcription regulation mechanisms of plant genes under abiotic stress. In this study, we cloned TaGAPC1 genes and its promoters from two wheat genomes, then investigated the expression patterns of TaGAPC1 under osmotic and salinity stress, and analyzed the promoter sequences. Moreover, the methylation patterns of promoters under stress were confirmed. Expression analysis indicated that TaGAPC1 was induced inordinately by stresses in two wheat genotypes with contrasting drought tolerance. Several stress-related cis-acting elements (MBS, DRE, GT1 and LTR et al.) were located in its promoters. Furthermore, the osmotic and salinity stress induced the demethylation of CG and CHG nucleotide in the promoter region of Changwu134. The methylation level of CHG and CHH in promoter of Zhengyin1 was always increased under stresses, and the CG contexts remained unchanged. The cytosine loci of stress-related cis-acting elements also showed different methylation changes in this process. These results provide insights into the relationship between promoter methylation and gene expression, promoting the function investigation of GAPC."

We used synteny between Brachypodium distachyon and wheat to identify potential candidates for both QTL. The 1BL QTL peak coincided with TaFT3-B1, a homologue of the barley gene HvFT3, the most likely candidate gene. The 1BS QTL peak coincided with homologues of Arabidopsis thaliana SENSITIVITY TO RED LIGHT REDUCED 1, WUSCHEL-like and RAP2.7, which is also known as Zea mays TARGET OF EAT1, named TaSRR1-B1, TaWUSCHELL-B1 and TaTOE1-B1, respectively. Gene expression assays suggest that TaTOE1-B1 and TaFT3-B1 are expressed more during short days. We identified four alleles of TaFT3-B1 and three alleles of TaTOE1-B1. We studied the effect of these alleles in the Watkins and GEDIFLUX diversity panels by using 936 and 431 accessions, respectively. Loss of TaFT3-B1 by deletion was associated with late flowering. Increased TaFT3-B1 copy number was associated with early flowering, suggesting that TaFT3-B1 promotes flowering.

"27776114","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a devastating disease of wheat and barley that leads to reduced yield and mycotoxin contamination of grain, making it unfit for human consumption. FHB is a global problem, with outbreaks in the United States, Canada, Europe, Asia and South America. In the United States alone, total direct and secondary economic losses from 1993 to 2001 owing to FHB were estimated at $7.67 billion. Fhb1 is the most consistently reported quantitative trait locus (QTL) for FHB resistance breeding. Here we report the map-based cloning of Fhb1 from a Chinese wheat cultivar Sumai 3. By mutation analysis, gene silencing and transgenic overexpression, we show that a pore-forming toxin-like (PFT) gene at Fhb1 confers FHB resistance. PFT is predicted to encode a chimeric lectin with two agglutinin domains and an ETX/MTX2 toxin domain. Our discovery identifies a new type of durable plant resistance gene conferring quantitative disease resistance to plants against Fusarium species."

"28117833","abstracttext","Fungal pathogens can rapidly evolve virulence towards resistant crops in agricultural ecosystems. Gains in virulence are often mediated by the mutation or deletion of a gene encoding a protein recognized by the plant immune system. However, the loci and the mechanisms of genome evolution enabling rapid virulence evolution are poorly understood. We performed genome-wide association mapping on a global collection of 106 strains of Zymoseptoria tritici, the most damaging pathogen of wheat in Europe, to identify polymorphisms linked to virulence on two wheat varieties. We found 25 distinct genomic loci associated with reproductive success of the pathogen. However, no locus was shared between the host genotypes, suggesting host specialization. The main locus associated with virulence encoded a highly expressed, small secreted protein. Population genomic analyses showed that the gain in virulence was explained by a segregating gene deletion polymorphism. The deletion was likely adaptive by preventing detection of the encoded protein. Comparative genomics of closely related species showed that the locus emerged de novo since speciation. A large cluster of transposable elements in direct proximity to the locus generated extensive rearrangements leading to multiple independent gene losses. Our study demonstrates that rapid turnover in the chromosomal structure of a pathogen can drive host specialization."

"28330552","abstracttext","Abiotic stresses, such as heat and drought, are major environmental factors restricting crop productivity and quality worldwide. A plastid outer envelope protein gene, TaOEP16-2, was identified from our previous transcriptome analysis [1,2]. In this study, the isolation and functional characterization of the TaOEP16-2 gene was reported. Three homoeologous sequences of TaOEP16-2 were isolated from hexaploid wheat, which were localized on the chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D, respectively. These three homoeologues exhibited different expression patterns under heat stress conditions, TaOEP16-2-5B was the dominant one, and TaOEP16-2-5B was selected for further analysis. Compared with wild type (WT) plants, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the TaOEP16-2-5B gene exhibited enhanced tolerance to heat stress, which was supported by improved survival rate, strengthened cell membrane stability and increased sucrose content. It was also found that TaOEP16-2 was induced by drought stress and involved in drought stress tolerance. TaOEP16-2-5B has the same function in ABA-controlled seed germination as AtOEP16-2. Our results suggest that TaOEP16-2-5B plays an important role in heat and drought stress tolerance, and could be utilized in transgenic breeding of wheat and other crop plants."

"28301718","abstracttext","The ability of the wheat Lr34 multipathogen resistance gene (Lr34res) to function across a wide taxonomic boundary was investigated in transgenic Sorghum bicolor. Increased resistance to sorghum rust and anthracnose disease symptoms following infection with the biotrophic pathogen Puccinia purpurea and the hemibiotroph Colletotrichum sublineolum, respectively, occurred in transgenic plants expressing the Lr34res ABC transporter. Transgenic sorghum lines that highly expressed the wheat Lr34res gene exhibited immunity to sorghum rust compared to the low-expressing single copy Lr34res genotype that conferred partial resistance. Pathogen-induced pigmentation mediated by flavonoid phytoalexins was evident on transgenic sorghum leaves following P. purpurea infection within 24-72 h, which paralleled Lr34res gene expression. Elevated expression of flavone synthase II, flavanone 4-reductase and dihydroflavonol reductase genes which control the biosynthesis of flavonoid phytoalexins characterized the highly expressing Lr34res transgenic lines 24-h post-inoculation with P. purpurea. Metabolite analysis of mesocotyls infected with C. sublineolum showed increased levels of 3-deoxyanthocyanidin metabolites were associated with Lr34res expression, concomitant with reduced symptoms of anthracnose."

"28744865","abstracttext","An increased invertase activity in infected plant tissue has been observed in many plant-pathogen interactions. However, the origin of this increased invertase activity (plant and/or pathogen) is still under debate. In addition, the role of pathogen invertases in the infection process is also unclear. We identified and cloned a gene with homology to invertases from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Transcript levels of PsINV were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR in both compatible and incompatible Pst-wheat interactions . Function of the gene product was confirmed by heterologous expression, and its function in Pst infection was analyzed by host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). Pst abundantly secretes invertase during its invasion attempts whether in a compatible or incompatible interaction with wheat. Further research into the different domains of this protein indicated that the rust-specific sequence contributes to a higher efficiency of sucrose hydrolysis. With PsINV silenced by HIGS during the infection process, growth of Pst is inhibited and conidial fructification incomplete. Finally, pathogenicity of Pst is impaired and spore yield significantly reduced. Our results clearly demonstrate that this Pst invertase plays a pivotal role in this plant-pathogen interaction probably by boosting sucrose hydrolysis to secure the pathogen's sugar absorption."

"29449594","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat. Resistant cultivars are the preferred strategy to control the disease. Space-induced wheat mutant R39 has adult-plant resistance (APR) to Pst. Genetic analysis indicated that a single recessive gene, designated YrR39, was responsible for the APR of R39 to Pst. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) combined with a SLAF sequencing (SLAF-seq) strategy was used to fine-map YrR39 to a 17.39 Mb segment on chromosome 4B. The region was confirmed by analysis with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A total of 126 genes were annotated in the region and 21 genes with annotations associated with disease response were selected for further qRT-PCR analysis. The candidate gene Traes_4BS_C868349E1 (annotated as an F-box/LRR-repeat protein) was up-regulated after 12, 24, 48, and 96 hours post inoculation with Pst, suggesting it is likely involved in the resistance. The current study demonstrated that BSA combined with SLAF-seq for SNP discovery is an efficient approach for mapping and identifying candidate functional gene."

"29695804","abstracttext","CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is a transformative technology that will facilitate the development of crops to meet future demands. However, application of gene editing is hindered by the long life cycle of many crop species and because desired genotypes generally require multiple generations to achieve. Single-celled microspores are haploid cells that can develop into double haploid plants and have been widely used as a breeding tool to generate homozygous plants within a generation. In this study, we combined the CRISPR/Cas9 system with microspore technology and developed an optimized haploid mutagenesis system to induce genetic modifications in the wheat genome. We investigated a number of factors that may affect the delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 reagents into microspores and found that electroporation of a minimum of 75,000 cells using 10-20 µg DNA and a pulsing voltage of 500 V is optimal for microspore transfection using the Neon transfection system. Using multiple Cas9 and sgRNA constructs, we present evidence for the seamless introduction of targeted modifications in an exogenous DsRed gene and two endogenous wheat genes, including TaLox2 and TaUbiL1. This study demonstrates the value and feasibility of combining microspore technology and CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing for trait discovery and improvement in plants."

"31059135","abstracttext","Kernel row number is a fundamental component of maize (Zea mays) yield and an important target for maize breeding. The revolutionary transition from the two-rowed teosinte to maize with increased kernel row numbers dramatically enhanced yields during domestication. Kernel row number is controlled by many quantitative trait loci (QTLs), however most genes responsible for these QTLs remain uncharacterised and the molecular genetic mechanisms are unknown. Here, we combined map-based cloning and association mapping to identify a major QTL for kernel row number, krn1, which is likely to correspond to an existing gene (ids1/Ts6) encoding an AP2 domain protein homologous to the product of the wheat key domestication gene Q. The increased expression of ids1/Ts6 in two maize mutants increased spikelet pair meristem numbers and then enhanced kernel row numbers. Nucleotide diversity analysis further revealed that ids1/Ts6 and Q were under strong parallel selection in maize and wheat that increased their yields during domestication or improvement. RNA-seq revealed that ids1/Ts6 is involved in multiple pathways regulating spikelet pair meristem development, involving several key genes such as fea3, fea4 and ra3. The cloning of the krn1 gene will pave a new way to efficiently improve maize yield in the near future."

"32117347","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina , threatens global wheat production due to the constant evolution of virulent pathotypes that defeat commercially deployed all stage-resistance (ASR) genes in modern cultivars. Hence, the deployment of combinations of adult plant resistance (APR) and ASR genes in new wheat cultivars is desirable. Adult plant resistance gene Lr49 was previously mapped on the long arm of chromosome 4B of cultivar VL404 and flanked by microsatellite markers barc163 (8.1 cM) and wmc349 (10.1 cM), neither of which was sufficiently closely linked for efficient marker assisted selection. This study used high-density SNP genotyping and flow sorted chromosome sequencing to fine-map the Lr49 locus as a starting point to develop a diagnostic marker for use in breeding and to clone this gene. Marker sunKASP_21 was mapped 0.4 cM proximal to Lr49 , whereas a group of markers including sunKASP_24 were placed 0.6 cM distal to this gene. Testing of the linked markers on 75 Australian and 90 European cultivars with diverse genetic backgrounds showed that sunKASP _ 21 was most strongly associated with Lr49 . Our results also show that the Lr49 genomic region contains structural variation relative to the reference stock Chinese Spring, possibly an inverted genomic duplication, which introduces a new set of challenges for the Lr49 cloning."

"32255940","abstracttext","The aim of this study was to investigate soil lead pollution on biochemical properties and gene expression pattern of antioxidant enzymes in three wheat cultivars (Morvarid, Gonbad and Tirgan) at flag leaf sheath swollen stage. Lead (Pb(NO 3 ) 2 ) was used at four different concentrations (0, 15, 30 and 45 mg/kg of soil). The leaf and roots samples were taken at late-booting stage (Zadoks code, GS: 45). The results showed that lead heavy metal toxicity increased the expression of some genes and the activity of key enzymes of the antioxidant defense system in wheat. Moreover, the cell oxidation levels (MDA, LOX) enhanced under lead stress conditions. The relative gene expression and activity of antioxidant enzymes ( CAT, SOD, GPX and APX ) increased significantly in the both leaves and root tissues under lead stress conditions. The level of gene expression and enzymatic activity were higher in the root than the leaf tissue. There was no significant difference among cultivars in each of lead concentrations but Morvarid and Tirgan cultivars had more tolerance to toxic concentrations of lead when compared to Gonbad cultivar."

"32284138","abstracttext","Three putative resistant (R1, R2, R3) and one susceptible (S) Lolium rigidum populations originating from Greece were studied for resistance to ALS and ACCase inhibiting herbicides, using whole plant, sequencing of als and accase gene, and in vitro ALS activity assays. The S and two R (R1, R2) populations were also evaluated for fitness in competition with wheat. The whole plant assay indicated unsatisfactory control of the R populations with mesosulfuron-methyl + iodosulfuron-methyl or pinoxaden application, whereas sequencing of the als gene revealed that all ALS-resistant individuals had a Pro-197 substitution by Leu, Glu, Ser, Ala, Thr, or Gln. In addition, the accase gene of all pinoxaden resistant individuals had an Ile-2041 substitution by Asn or Thr. Furthermore, sequencing of the individuals surviving mesosulfuron-methyl + iodosulfuron-methyl or pinoxaden treatment revealed co-existence of point mutations in the accase or als genes, respectively, demonstrating multiple resistance. The in vitro activity of the ALS enzyme confirmed that resistance to mesosulfuron-methyl + iodosulfuron-methyl was due altered target-site. The recorded higher vigor and greater competitive ability of S population against wheat as compared with that of the R populations suggests an associated fitness cost with multiple resistance."

This study identified 29 ASR genes in wheat. 23 pairs of tandem duplication genes and six pairs of segmental duplication genes were found in wheat ASR (TaASR) gene family, respectively. It is speculated that gene duplication event is the main driving force of TaASR genes evolution. Using published RNA-seq data and the qRT-PCR results of 12 TaASR genes, we analyzed the expression profiles for TaASR genes under abiotic stresses. It found that most of the genes mainly responded to salt and low temperature stress. Finally, subcellular localization and self-activation experiments showed that the proteins encoded by 12 TaASR genes were all located in the nucleus and cell membrane, and the full-length proteins had self-activation activity, which supported their role as transcription factors. This study provides a scientific basis for a comprehensive understanding of the TaASR gene family."

"32354160","abstracttext","Abiotic stresses are major constraints limiting crop growth and production. Heat shock factors (Hsfs) play significant roles in mediating plant resistance to various environmental stresses, including heat, drought and salinity. In this study, we explored the biological functions and underlying mechanisms of wheat TaHsfA6f in plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses. Gene expression profiles showed that TaHsfA6f has relatively high expression levels in wheat leaves at the reproductive stage. Transcript levels of TaHsfA6f were substantially up-regulated by heat, dehydration, salinity, low temperature, and multiple phytohormones, but was not induced by brassinosteroids (BR). Subcellular localization analyses revealed that TaHsfA6f is localized to the nucleus. Overexpression of the TaHsfA6f gene in Arabidopsis results in improved tolerance to heat, drought and salt stresses, enhanced sensitivity to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), and increased accumulation of ABA. Furthermore, RNA-sequencing data demonstrated that TaHsfA6f functions through up-regulation of a number of genes involved in ABA metabolism and signaling, and other stress-associated genes. Collectively, these results provide evidence that TaHsfA6f participates in the regulation of multiple abiotic stresses, and that TaHsfA6f could serve as a valuable gene for genetic modification of crop abiotic stress tolerance."

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to speckled snow mold were identified in a doubled haploid population derived from a cross between Münstertaler and susceptible variety Ibis, both under field conditions and controlled environment tests. Composite interval mapping analysis revealed a major QTL on chromosome 5D from Münstertaler, and on chromosome 6B from Ibis. Flanking microsatellite marker cfd 29 for the QTL on chromosome 5D was about 5 cM distant from vernalization requirement gene Vrn-D1 , suggesting that the QTL on chromosome 5D is located on a cold-stress-related gene cluster along with Vrn-D1 and freezing tolerance gene Fr-D1 . The QTL on chromosome 6B from Ibis was located on the centromere region flanking QTn.mst-6B , which is reported to increase plant tiller number."

"32447006","abstracttext","Resistant starch (RS) also known as healthy starch has shown several health benefits. Enhancing the RS through genetic modification approaches has huge commercial importance. Regulatory RNA like long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) plays an important role in gene regulation. In this study, we mined 63 transcriptome datasets of wheat belonging to 35 genotypes representing two seed developmental stages. Contrasting expression of a subset of lncRNAs in RS mutant lines compared to parent wheat variety 'C 306' signifies their probable role in RS biosynthesis. Further, lncRNA- TCONS_00130663 showed strong positive correlation (r 2  = 1) with LYPL gene and strong negative correlation with SBEIIb (r 2  = -0.94). We found TCONS_00130663 as positive regulator of LYPL gene through interaction with miR1128. Based on relative expression, in silico interaction and DSC analysis we hypothesize the dual role of TCONS_00130663 in RS type 2 and type 5. The study provides a useful resource for functional mechanism of lncRNAs."

"30395927","abstracttext","The rhizosphere bacterium Bacillus cereus 905 is capable of promoting plant growth through effective colonization on plant roots. The sodA2-encoding manganese-containing superoxide dismutase (MnSOD2) is important for survival of B. cereus 905 in the wheat rhizosphere. However, the genes involved in regulating sodA2 expression and the mechanisms of rhizosphere colonization of B. cereus 905 are not well elucidated. In this study, we found that the deletion of the ptsH gene, which encodes the histidine-phosphorylatable protein (HPr), a component of the phosphotransferase system (PTS), causes a decrease of about 60% in the MnSOD2 expression. Evidences indicate that the ptsH dramatically influences resistance to oxidative stress, glucose uptake, as well as biofilm formation and swarming motility of B. cereus 905. Root colonization assay demonstrated that ΔptsH is defective in colonizing wheat roots, while complementation of the sodA2 gene could partially restore the ability in utilization of arabinose, a non-PTS sugar, and root colonization caused by the loss of the ptsH gene. In toto, based on the current findings, we propose that PtsH contributes to root colonization of B. cereus 905 through multiple indistinct mechanisms, involving PTS and uptake of PTS-sugars, up-regulation of MnSOD2 production, and promotion of biofilm formation and swarming motility."

Three races of P. striiformis and a β-glucuronidase-transformed strain of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides were used to inoculate plants and evaluate disease reactions. Of the 115 D. villosum accessions tested, 33 (28.6%) were resistant to one or more races of Puccinia striiformis and 8 accessions were resistant to all races. All 219 accessions of D. villosum tested were resistant to Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides and 158 (72%) of the accessions had lower β-glucuronidase activity than the resistant wheat line VPM-1. Most of the accessions of D. villosum resistant to the stripe rust pathogen originated from Greece; however, there was no distinction among origins for resistance to the eyespot pathogen. Chromosome 4V was confirmed to carry the gene for resistance to P. herpotrichoides. At least one gene for resistance to Puccinia striiformis was located on the short arm of chromosome 6V of D. villosum in the 6VS/6AL-translocation line; this gene was named Yr26."

"30689125","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is an obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen causing stripe rust, one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. Mutation is considered as one of the major mechanisms causing virulence changes in the pathogen population, but experimental evidence is limited. To study the effect of mutation on pathogen variation, we developed 33 mutant isolates by treating urediniospores of Pst race PSTv-18, avirulent to all of the 18 Yr single-gene lines used to differentiate Pst races, with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). These isolates were characterized as 24 races, including 19 new races, through virulence testing on the set of 18 wheat Yr single-gene differential lines; and as 21 multi-locus genotypes with 19 simple sequence repeat and 48 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers. Most of the mutant isolates had more than one avirulence gene and more than one marker locus changed compared to the wild type isolate, indicating that EMS is able to cause mutations at multiple genome sites. The results showed that mutation can cause substantial changes in both avirulence and other genomic regions. The different frequencies of virulence among the mutant isolates suggested homozygous or heterozygous avirulence loci in the parental isolate, or relative ease of mutation at some avirulence loci. The results are useful for understanding evolutionary mechanisms of the important fungal pathogen."

"31804903","abstracttext","Pseudomonas fuscovaginae, first reported from Japan in 1976, is now present in many agroecological regions around the world; it causes sheath brown rot of rice and is reported as a pathogen of a broad range of hosts. The pathogen can infect rice plants at all stages of growth and is known to cause significant losses due to grain discoloration, poor spike emergence and panicle sterility. Limited information is available on the virulence and mechanisms of pathogenicity for P. fuscovaginae . To address this, an analysis of genomes was conducted, which identified the presence of a gene showing homology to one of the genes contributing to syringopeptin synthetase ( sypA ) of P. syringae pv. syringae . To study the potential role of this gene in the virulence and pathogenicity of P. fuscovaginae , a site-specific mutation was created. Following inoculation of seeds and plantlets of rice and wheat with P. fuscovaginae wild types and their respective mutants, we demonstrated that the mutation significantly reduced virulence. This was evident on rice and wheat inoculated with mutants causing a significantly higher number of roots, length of roots and seedling height compared with their respective wild types. Characteristic disease symptoms of necrotic lesions were significantly less in rice seedlings infected with bacterial suspensions of mutants indicating a reduction in virulence. Chromatography analysis of bacterial exudates showed suppression of synthesis of metabolites analogous to syringopeptin in the mutants. These data demonstrate that the protein encoded by this sypA homolog gene is a major virulence determinant of P. fuscovaginae ."

"31165748","abstracttext","DUOII is a multi-ovary wheat line with two or three pistils and three stamens in each floret. The multi-ovary trait of DUOII is controlled by a dominant gene, whose expression can be suppressed by the heterogeneous cytoplasm of TeZhiI (TZI), a line with the nucleus of common wheat and the cytoplasm of Aegilops. DUOII (♀) × TZI (♂) shows multi-ovary trait, while TZI (♀) × DUOII (♂) shows mono-ovary. Observing the developmental process, we found that the critical stage of additional pistil primordium development was when the young spikes were 2-6 mm long. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for the heterogeneous cytoplasmic suppression of the multi-ovary gene, we RNA-sequenced the entire transcriptome of 2-6 mm long young spikes obtained from the reciprocal crosses between DUOII and TZI. A total of 600 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was identified. Functional annotation of these DEGs showed that the heterogeneous cytoplasmic suppression of additional pistil development mainly involved four pathways, i.e., chloroplast metabolism, DNA replication and repair, hormone signal transduction, and trehalose-6-phosphate in the primordium development stage, which cooperated to modulate the multi-ovary gene expression under heterogeneous cytoplasmic suppression."

Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) and competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analysis were further performed for differentially expressed noncoding RNAs and target genes. At last, the candidate genes were silenced by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) to prove their function. The sterile genes were mapped on chromosomes 1B and 6B based on chip mix pool analysis, and one major effect QTL (27.3190% variation) was found based on SSR primers. The WGCNA analysis revealed that the dark turquoise and steel blue modules were highly correlated with anther development and fertility conversion, respectively. The ceRNA analysis showed that a total of 184 RNAs interacted with each other, including 115 mRNAs, 55 microRNAs (miRNAs), eight circRNAs, and six lncRNAs.

A contiguous portion of the Gli-B3 locus is shown to contain two apparently active omega-gliadin genes, two pseudogenes, and four fragments of the 3' portion of omega-gliadin sequences. Comparison of omega-gliadin sequences allows a phylogenetic picture of their relationships and genomes of origin. Results show three groupings of omega-gliadin active gene sequences assigned to each of the three hexaploid wheat genomes, and a fourth group thus far consisting of pseudogenes assigned to the A-genome. Analysis of omega-gliadin ESTs allows reconstruction of two full-length model sequences encoding the AREL- and ARQL-type proteins from the Gli-A3 and Gli-D3 loci, respectively. There is no DNA evidence of multiple active genes from these two loci. In contrast, ESTs allow identification of at least three to four distinct active genes at the Gli-B3 locus of some cultivars.

A class of ice binding proteins that inhibit ice re-crystallisation, specific to the Pooideae subfamily lineage, have been identified in perennial ryegrass and wheat, and these proteins are thought to have evolved from a leucine-rich repeat phytosulfokine receptor kinase (LRR-PSR)-like ancestor gene. Even though the ice re-crystallisation inhibition function of these proteins has been studied extensively in vitro, little is known about the evolution of these genes on the molecular level."
"18775065","abstracttext_results","We identified 15 putative novel ice re-crystallisation inhibition (IRI)-like protein coding genes in perennial ryegrass, barley, and wheat.

We also explored the hypothesis that the IRI-domain has evolved through repeated motif expansion and investigated the evolutionary relationship between a LRR-domain containing IRI coding gene in carrot and the Pooideae IRI-like genes. Our analysis showed that the main expansion of the IRI-gene family happened ~36 million years ago (Mya). In addition to IRI-like paralogs, wheat contained several sequences that likely were products of polyploidisation events (homoeologs). Through sequence analysis we identified two short motifs in the rice LRR-PSR gene highly similar to the repeat motifs of the IRI-domain in cold tolerant grasses. Finally we show that the LRR-domain of carrot and grass IRI proteins both share homology to an Arabidopsis thaliana LRR-trans membrane protein kinase (LRR-TPK)."

From our sequence analysis we provide evidence for IRI-domain evolution probably occurring through increased copy number of a repeated motif. Finally, we discuss the possibility of parallel evolution of LRR domain containing IRI proteins in carrot and grasses through two completely different molecular adaptations."

"16209134","abstracttext","Guidelines to ensure the efficient coexistence of genetically modified (GM) and conventional crops are currently being considered across the European Union. The purpose of this strategy is to describe the measures a farmer must adopt to minimize the admixture of GM and non-GM crops. Minimizing pollen/seed-mediated gene flow between GM and non-GM crops is central to successful coexistence. However no system is currently available to permit the numeric quantification of a crop's propensity for pollen/seed-mediated gene flow. The provision of such a system could permit a background level of gene flow, specific for a particular conventional crop, to be calculated. Here we present a gene flow index model implemented using the principal arable crops in Ireland as a model dataset. The objective of this research was to establish a baseline gene flow data set for Ireland's primary conventional crops through the provision of a simple numerical index. This Gene Flow Index (GFI) incorporates four strands of crop-mediated gene flow (crop pollen-to-crop, crop pollen-to-wild, crop seed-to-volunteer and crop seed-to-feral) into a format that permits the calculation of a crop's gene flow potential. Responsive to regional parameters, we have applied the model to sugar beet, oilseed rape, potato, ryegrass, maize, wheat and barley. We propose that the attained indices will highlight those crops that require additional measures in order to minimize gene flow in accordance with anticipated coexistence guidelines."

Contrary to the classical case, in which selection acts on a single, newly arisen beneficial mutation, we considered selection from standing variation (soft selective sweeps) on a gene (Rht-B1) with a major effect on plant height, a selected trait in an experimental wheat population grown for 17 generations, and we documented the evolution of gene diversity and linkage disequilibrium near this gene. As expected, Rht-B1 was found to be under strong selection (s = 0.15) and its variation in frequency accounted for 15% of the total trait evolution. This led to a smaller genetic effective population size at Rht-B1 (N(eg) = 18) compared to the whole genome estimation (N(eg) = 167). When compared with expectations under genetic drift only, no significant decrease in gene diversity was found at the closest loci. We computed expected di-locus frequencies for any linked marker-Rht-B1 pair due to hitch-hiking effects. We found that hitch-hiking was expected to affect the two most closely linked loci, but expected reduction in gene diversity was not greater than that due to genetic drift, which was consistent with the observations. Such limited effect was attributed to the low level of linkage disequilibrium (0.16) estimated after parental intercrosses, together with a relatively high initial frequency of the gene. This situation is favourable to candidate gene approaches where small linkage disequilibrium around selected genes is expected."

"17632581","abstracttext","Phaeosphaeria species are important causal agents of Stagonospora leaf blotch diseases in cereals. In this study, the nucleotide sequence and deduced polypeptide of the trifunctional histidine biosynthesis gene (his) are used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships and provide molecular identification among cereal Phaeosphaeria species. The full-length sequences of the his gene were obtained by PCR amplification and compared among cereal Phaeosphaeria species. The coding sequence of the his gene in wheat-biotype P. nodorum (PN-w) was 2697 bp. The his genes in barley-biotype P. nodorum (PN-b), two P. avenaria f. sp. triticea isolates (homothallic Pat1 and Pat3), and Phaeosphaeria species from Polish rye and dallis grass were 2694 bp. The his gene in heterothallic isolate Pat2, however, was 2693 bp because the intron had one fewer base. In P. avenaria f. sp. avenaria (Paa), the his gene was only 2670 bp long. The differences in the size of the his gene contributed to the variation in amino acid sequences in the gap region located between the phosphoribosyl-ATP pyrophosphohydrolase and histidinol dehydrogenase sub-domains. Based on nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the his gene, Pat1 was not closely related to either PN-w or the Paa clade. It appears that rates of evolution of the his gene were fast in cereal Phaeosphaeria species. The possible involvement of meiotic recombination in genetic diversity of the his gene in P. nodorum is discussed."
"23326580","articletitle","Insular organization of gene space in grass genomes."
"23326580","abstracttext","Wheat and maize genes were hypothesized to be clustered into islands but the hypothesis was not statistically tested. The hypothesis is statistically tested here in four grass species differing in genome size, Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor, and Aegilops tauschii. Density functions obtained under a model where gene locations follow a homogeneous Poisson process and thus are not clustered are compared with a model-free situation quantified through a non-parametric density estimate. A simple homogeneous Poisson model for gene locations is not rejected for the small O. sativa and B. distachyon genomes, indicating that genes are distributed largely uniformly in those species, but is rejected for the larger S. bicolor and Ae. tauschii genomes, providing evidence for clustering of genes into islands. It is proposed to call the gene islands ""gene insulae"" to distinguish them from other types of gene clustering that have been proposed. An average S. bicolor and Ae. tauschii insula is estimated to contain 3.7 and 3.9 genes with an average intergenic distance within an insula of 2.1 and 16.5 kb, respectively. Inter-insular distances are greater than 8 and 81 kb and average 15.1 and 205 kb, in S. bicolor and Ae. tauschii, respectively. A greater gene density observed in the distal regions of the Ae. tauschii chromosomes is shown to be primarily caused by shortening of inter-insular distances. The comparison of the four grass genomes suggests that gene locations are largely a function of a homogeneous Poisson process in small genomes. Nonrandom insertions of LTR retroelements during genome expansion creates gene insulae, which become less dense and further apart with the increase in genome size. High concordance in relative lengths of orthologous intergenic distances among the investigated genomes including the maize genome suggests functional constraints on gene distribution in the grass genomes."

"28694803","abstracttext","Xanthomonas translucens is the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak, the most common bacterial disease of wheat and barley. To cause disease, most xanthomonads depend on a highly conserved type III secretion system, which translocates type III effectors into host plant cells. Mutagenesis of the conserved type III secretion gene hrcT confirmed that the X. translucens type III secretion system is required to cause disease on the host plant barley and to trigger a non-host hypersensitive response (HR) in pepper leaves. Type III effectors are delivered to the host cell by a surface appendage, the Hrp pilus, and a translocon protein complex that inserts into the plant cell plasma membrane. Homologs of the Xanthomonas HrpF protein, including PopF from Ralstonia solanacearum and NolX from rhizobia, are thought to act as a translocon protein. Comparative genomics revealed that X. translucens strains harbor a noncanonical hrp gene cluster, which rather shares features with type III secretion systems from Ralstonia solanacearum , Paraburkholderia andropogonis , Collimonas fungivorans , and Uliginosibacterium gangwonense than other Xanthomonas spp. Surprisingly, none of these bacteria, except R. solanacearum , encode a homolog of the HrpF translocon. Here, we aimed at identifying a candidate translocon from X. translucens . Notably, genomes from strains that lacked hrpF / popF / nolX instead encode another gene, called hpaT , adjacent to and co-regulated with the type III secretion system gene cluster. An insertional mutant in the X. translucens hpaT gene, which is the first gene of a two-gene operon, hpaT - hpaH , was non-pathogenic on barley and did not cause the HR or programmed cell death in non-host pepper similar to the hrcT mutant. The hpaT mutant phenotypes were partially complemented by either hpaT or the downstream gene, hpaH , which has been described as a facilitator of translocation in Xanthomonas oryzae . Interestingly, the hpaT mutant was also complemented by the hrpF gene from Xanthomonas euvesicatoria . These findings reveal that both HpaT and HpaH contribute to the injection of type III effectors into plant cells."

"1339324","abstracttext","Total genomic DNA was isolated from three cereal stem rusts, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, f. sp. secalis, f. sp. avenae, and two cereal leaf rusts, P. recondita f. sp. tritici and P. coronata f. sp. avenae, and analyzed for the presence of heterogeneity in the intergenic region of the ribosomal DNA repeat unit. A 1 kb region of the repeat unit between the 26s and the 5s rRNA genes (IGR-1) was amplified by PCR and was found to be heterogeneous within each isolate and variable in size between races and species. The PCR results were confirmed by Southern blot analysis of native DNA. In an isolate of race C36(48), heterogeneity appeared to be due to variable numbers of 0.1 kb subrepeats in IGR-1. Nine wheat stem rust strains representing nine different races produced a unique pattern of heterogeneity while two different isolates of one race were identical, as were five of another. This may provide a rapid method for race identification in wheat stem rust. Heterogeneity and polymorphism in rye stem rust, oat stem rust, wheat leaf rust, and oat crown rust, was less pronounced than in wheat stem rust. In the course of this work, the 5s rRNA gene was located and its position and orientation within the ribosomal repeat unit was established."

Indeed, the compositional distribution of nuclear DNA molecules (in the 50-100 Kb size range) from three dicots (pea, sunflower and tobacco) and three monocots (maize, rice and wheat) were found to be centered around lower (41%) and higher (45% for rice, 48% for maize and wheat) GC levels, respectively (and to trail towards even higher GC values in maize and wheat). Experiments on gene localization in density gradient fractions showed a remarkable compositional homogeneity in vast (greater than 100-200 Kb) regions surrounding the genes. On the other hand, the compositional distribution of coding sequences (GenBank and literature data) from dicots (several orders) was found to be narrow, symmetrical and centered around 46% GC, that from monocots (essentially barley, maize and wheat) to be broad, asymmetrical and characterized by an upward trend towards high GC values, with the majority of sequences between 60 and 70% GC. Introns exhibited a similar compositional distribution, but lower GC levels, compared to exons from the same genes."

No such hybridization was observed with DNA from photosynthetic bacteria. 2. A fragment amplified from Phormidium laminosum DNA has been characterized and shown to be 73% similar to the corresponding wheat sequence. At the protein level the similarity is 91%. When used as a probe for Southern blotting the Phormidium DNA fragment confirmed the authenticity of some of the original signals obtained with the wheat probe. 3. Peptides of molecular mass 36, 30 and 60 kDa are immunodetected by a wheat reductase antibody during Western blotting of Phormidium preparations. These are purported to correspond to the cyanobacterial mature reductase protein, a stable proteolytic fragment and soluble dimeric forms of the latter respectively. 4. Adaptation of Phormidium to growth in red light (delta > 670 nm) or darkness led to no significant changes in the total level of immunodetected peptides or protochlorophyllide within the cells. 5. The specific activity of the reductase in Phormidium membranes has been tentatively estimated as 0.5 unit/mg of protein, a value comparable with that found in preparations from mature chloroplasts of higher plants."

"9016571","abstracttext","The most highly conserved structures of group II introns are the helical domains V and VI near the 3'splice site. Within this region of each of the four introns in the wheat mitochondrial nad7 gene encoding NADH dehydrogenase subunit 7, there are A-C mispairs. To determine whether C-to-U type RNA editing restores conventional A-U pairing, we sequenced RT-PCR products from partially-spliced nad7 template RNA and gel-fractionated, excised intron RNA. We examined transcripts from germinating wheat embryos and seedlings because these two stages of development show pronounced differences in steady state levels of nad7 intronic RNAs. We observed editing at only two of the six predicted sites, and they were located at homologous positions within domain V of the third and fourth introns. A third site was found to be edited within the unmodelled domain VI loop of the fourth intron. Similar patterns of RNA editing were seen in wheat embryos and seedlings. These observations, and the presence of other non-conventional base pairs particularly within domain V of plant mitochondrial introns, indicate weaker helical core structure than in ribozymic group II introns. Moreover, the incompleteness or absence of editing in wheat nad7 excised intron RNA suggests that, although editing may contribute to splicing efficiency, it is not essential for splicing."

"11062037","abstracttext","The 19-kDa capsid protein (CP) of Soil-borne wheat mosaic furovirus (SBWMV) is encoded in the 5'-terminal region of RNA2. In addition to CP, two CP-related proteins are translated from SBWMV RNA2: (1) a 24-kDa protein (N-CP) with an N-terminal 40-amino-acid extension initiated at an upstream in-frame CUG codon; and (2) an 83-kDa protein (CP-RT) with an about 580-amino-acid, C-terminal extension by partial translational readthrough at the UGA termination codon at the end of the CP gene. We examined requirements for N-CP and CP-RT on virion formation and systemic infection in wheat plants using full-length cDNA clones, from which infectious RNA can be transcribed in vitro. RNA2 mutants, which could not synthesize N-CP, CP-RT, or either infected wheat plants systemically in combination with the wild-type RNA1 transcripts, produced rod-shaped virus particles in uninoculated upper leaves. Original mutations which abolished translation of N-CP and CP-RT were confirmed on RNA2 extracted from purified virus from the upper leaves by nucleotide sequence analysis. These results indicate that neither N-terminal nor C-terminal extensions to the CP are required for virion formation and systemic infection of SBWMV in wheat plants."

"11768217","abstracttext","The wheat--Thinopyrum intermedium addition lines Z1 and Z2 carry 21 pairs of wheat chromosomes and one pair of Th. intermedium chromosomes (2Ai-2) conferring resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). GISH results using the genomic DNA of Pseudoroegneria strigosa (S genome) as the probe indicated that the 2Ai-2 chromosome in Z1 and Z2 is an S-J intercalary translocation. Most of the 2Ai-2 chromosome belongs to the S genome, except for about one third in the middle region of the long arm that belongs to the J genome. The results of detailed RFLP analyses confirmed that the 2Ai-2 chromosome is extensively homoeologous to wheat group 2 chromosomes. Some new RFLP markers specific to the 2Ai-2 chromosome were identified. A RAPD marker, OP-R16(340), specific to the 2Ai-2 chromosome, was screened. We converted the RAPD marker into a sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker (designated SC-R16). The study establishes the basis for selecting translocation lines with small segments of the 2Ai-2 chromosome and localizing the BYDV resistance gene when introgressed into a wheat background."

"12595991","abstracttext","Analysis of a cDNA library from wheat cv Wyuna endosperm, indicated a significant size and sequence variation among seed-endosperm protein genes. In this study, a family of low-molecular-weight seed protein genes are analysed that are related to the gliadins and the low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. Sequence analysis and comparison of these proteins showed that they are closely related to a 17-kDa protein from barley, epsilon hordein, which plays a role in beer foam stability in the brewing industry. Mapping of these genes in wheat shows that they are located on group 7 and 4 chromosomes, as opposed to a group 1 and 6 location for the glutenins and gliadins. It is possible that this family of proteins forms a new class of seed-endosperm proteins important in defining the quality characteristics of wheat flour. Therefore, a representative gene from this family was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified protein was supplemented into a base wheat flour. Rheological analysis showed that the protein effected dough strength and resistance break down during mixing of the dough, and provided a 20% increase in loaf height after baking."

"12835934","abstracttext","This work reports the molecular characterisation of new alleles of the previously reported Glu-R1 locus. Wheat lines carrying the chromosome substitution 1R(1D), rye cultivars and related wild species were analysed. Five new x-type and four y-type Glu-R1 glutenin subunits were isolated and characterised. The coding region of the sequences shows the typical structure of the HMW glutenin genes previously described in wheat, with the N and C-terminal domains flanking the central repetitive region. Tri-, hexa- and nona-peptides found in the central repetitive region of wheat glutenin genes were also present in the rye genes. Duplications and deletions of these motifs are responsible for allelic variation at the Glu-R1 locus. Orthologous genes (from different genomes) were more closely related than paralogous genes (x- and y-type), supporting the hypothesis of gene duplication before Triticeae speciation. Differences in the number and position of cysteine residues identified alleles which in wheat are associated with good dough quality. SDS proteins encoded by some characterised alleles were presumptively identified."

"15946751","abstracttext","DNA methylation of cytosine residues, catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases, is suggested to play important roles in regulating gene expression and plant development. In this study, we isolated four wheat cDNA fragments and one cDNA with open reading frame encoding putative DNA methyltransferase and designated TaMET1, TaMET2a, TaMET2b, TaCMT, TaMET3, respectively. BLASTX searches and phylogenetic analysis suggested that five cDNAs belonged to four classes (Dnmt1, Dnmt2, CMT and Dnmt3) of DNA methyltransferase genes. TaMET2a encoded a protein of 376 aa and contained eight of ten conserved motifs characteristic of DNA methyltransferase. Genomic sequence of TaMET2a was obtained and found to contain ten introns and eleven exons. The expression analysis of the five genes revealed that they were expressed in developing seed, during germination and various vegetative tissues, but in quite different abundance. It was interesting to note that TaMET1 and TaMET3 mRNAs were clearly detected in dry seeds. Moreover, the differential expression patterns of five genes were observed between wheat hybrid and its parents in leaf, stem and root of jointing stage, some were up-regulated while some others were down-regulated in the hybrid. We concluded that multiple wheat DNA methyltransferase genes were present and might play important roles in wheat growth and development."

Full genomic sequences of three DFRs were isolated in hexaploid wheat. Loci of TaDFRs were found in a more proximal region of the long arm of chromosomes of homoeologous group 3 than the R gene for red grain colour of wheat. These DFRs were designated TaDFR-A, TaDFR-B, and TaDFR-D on chromosome 3A, 3B, and 3D, respectively. In the 5' upstream region of DFR genes, two or three combinations of a G box core element and a putative binding site for a Myb-type transcription factor, P, of maize were found. Expression of DFR reached a maximal level in red grain of wheat cv. Chinese Spring (CS) at 5 d post-anthesis (DPA) and decreased gradually in the grain coat tissue from 10 to 20 DPA, in contrast to a very low expression level of DFR in white wheat grain during the same period. These DFRs differed in their expression. TaDFR-B and -D were expressed predominantly in grains. In developing leaves, DFR expression was light-responsive, and TaDFR-B was more up-regulated in leaves and roots than the other two."

"14558696","abstracttext","Plants possess an efficient nonself surveillance system triggering induced disease resistance mechanisms upon molecular recognition of microbial invaders. Successful pathogens have evolved strategies to evade or counteract these mechanisms, e.g., by the generation of suppressors. Pectic fragments produced during host cell wall degradation can act as endogenous suppressors of the hypersensitive response in wheat leaves. We have isolated and characterized homogalacturonans from cell walls of two wheat cultivars susceptible to the stem rust fungus, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, namely cvs. Prelude and Marquis, and from near-isogenic lines of both cultivars containing the Sr5-gene for hypersensitive rust resistance. Two independent approaches were used to compare their methyl esterification: i) immunochemistry using the monoclonal antibodies JIM5, JIM7, PAM1, and LM7 and ii) chromatography of oligogalacturonides representing stretches of contiguous nonmethyl-esterified GalA residues. The results clearly indicate a significant difference in the homogalacturonans from susceptible and resistant wheat lines. The difference can best be explained by assuming a nonrandom and more blockwise distribution of the methyl esters in the homogalacturonans of susceptible wheat cultivars as compared with a presumably more random distribution in the near-isogenic resistant lines. Possible consequences of this difference for the enzymatic generation of endogenous suppressors are discussed."

"18464860","abstracttext","Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance in soft red winter wheat (SRWW) cultivars has been achieved by substituting a group 7 chromosome from Thinopyrum intermedium for chromosome 7D. To localize BYDV resistance, a detailed molecular genetic analysis was done on the alien group 7 Th. intermedium chromosome to determine its structural organization. Triticeae group 7 RFLP markers and rye specific repetitive sequences used in the analysis showed that the alien chromosome in the P29 substitution line has distinguishing features. The 350-480 bp rye telomeric sequence family was present on the long arm as determined by Southern and fluorescence in situ hybridization. However, further analysis using a rye dispersed repetitive sequence indicated that this alien chromosome does not contain introgressed segments from the rye genome. The alien chromosome is homoeologous to wheat chromosomes 7A and 7D as determined by RFLP analysis. Presence of the waxy gene on chromosomes 7A, 7B, and 7D but its absence on the alien chromosome in P29 suggests some internal structural differences on the short arm between Th. intermedium and wheat group 7 chromosomes. The identification of rye telomeric sequences on the alien Thinopyrum chromosome and the homoeology to wheat chromosomes 7A and 7D provide the necessary information and tools to analyze smaller segments of the Thinopyrum chromosome and to localize BYDV resistance in SRWW cultivars."

"16310366","abstracttext","Marama bean, Tylosema esculentum, is a tuberous legume native to the Kalahari region of Southern Africa where it grows under high temperatures (typical daily max 37 degrees C during growing season) and radiation (frequently in excess of 2000 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) in sandy soils with low rainfall. These conditions might be expected to select for increased water-use efficiency of photosynthesis. However, marama was found to give similar leaf photosynthetic rates to other C3 plants for a given internal leaf CO2 concentration and Rubisco content. Under conditions of increasing drought, no increase in water-use efficiency of photosynthesis was observed, but stomata closed early and preceded any change in leaf water potential. The possibility of subtle adaptations of photosynthetic characteristics to its natural environment were investigated at the level of Rubisco kinetics. The specificity factor of marama Rubisco was slightly lower than that of wheat, but the apparent Km for CO2 in air (Km') was about 20% lower than that of wheat. This is consistent with better adaptation for efficient photosynthesis at high temperatures in marama compared to wheat, although the net benefit is predicted to be very small (<0.5% at 35 degrees C). The sequence of marama rbcL gene shows 27 deduced amino acid residue differences from that for wheat, and the possibility that one or more of these cause the difference in Rubisco Km' is discussed."

"19120463","abstracttext","Organically bound sulfur makes up about 90% of the total sulfur in soils, with sulfonates often the dominant fraction. Actinobacteria affiliated to the genus Rhodococcus were able to desulfonate arylsulfonates in wheat rhizospheres from the Broadbalk long-term field wheat experiment, which includes plots treated with inorganic fertilizer with and without sulfate, with farmyard manure, and unfertilized plots. Direct isolation of desulfonating rhizobacteria yielded Rhodococcus strains which grew well with a range of sulfonates, and contained the asfAB genes, known to be involved in sulfonate desulfurization by bacteria. Expression of asfA in vitro increased >100-fold during growth of the Rhodococcus isolates with toluenesulfonate as sulfur source, compared with growth with sulfate. By contrast, the closely related Rhodococcus erythropolis and Rhodococcus opacus type strains had no desulfonating activity and did not contain asfA homologues. The overall actinobacterial community structure in wheat rhizospheres was influenced by the sulfur fertilization regime, as shown by specific denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of PCR amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments, and asfAB clone library analysis identified nine different asfAB genotypes closely affiliated to the Rhodococcus isolates. However, asfAB-based multiplex restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP)/terminal-RFLP analysis of wheat rhizosphere communities revealed only slight differences between the fertilization regimes, suggesting that the desulfonating Rhodococcus community does not specifically respond to changes in sulfate supply."

"18943069","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Wheat (Thinopyrum ponticum line SS767; PI 611939) with 42 chromosomes previously was identified as a new source of eyespot resistance. Individual plants of SS767 were tested for reaction to Tapesia yallundae, the major pathogen of eyespot in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Resistance of this line was similar to the resistant winter wheat cv. Madsen (carrying gene Pch1 for eyespot resistance). Polymerase chain reaction analysis with primers specific for the J or E genomes revealed that SS767 contains Thinopyrum chromatin. Cytological and Cbanding analyses demonstrated that SS767 is a chromosome substitution line in which wheat chromosome 4D is replaced by a homoeologous group 4 chromosome of Thinopyrum ponticum. Genomic in situ hybridization using St genomic DNA from Pseudoroegneria strigosa as a probe, which can differentiate chromosomes from different genomes of Thinopyrum, indicated that this chromosome belongs to the J genome. Molecular analysis of an F(2) population segregating for chromosome 4J and resistance to eyespot confirmed that eyespot resistance in line SS767 is associated with chromosome 4J of Thinopyrum ponticum. This is the first report of genetic control of resistance to eyespot derived from Thinopyrum ponticum. This source of resistance provides a new opportunity to improve wheat resistance to eyespot by adding to the diversity of resistance sources available."

"19054353","abstracttext","A deeper understanding of the drought response and genetic improvement of the cultivated crops for better tolerance requires attention because of the complexity of the drought response syndrome and the loss of genetic diversity during domestication. We initially screened about 200 wild emmer wheat genotypes and then focused on 26 of these lines, which led to the selection of two genotypes with contrasting responses to water deficiency. Six subtractive cDNA libraries were constructed, and over 13 000 expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were sequenced using leaf and root tissues of wild emmer wheat genotypes TR39477 (tolerant) and TTD-22 (sensitive), and modern wheat variety Kiziltan drought stressed for 7 d. Clustering and assembly of ESTs resulted in 2376 unique sequences (1159 without hypothetical proteins and no hits), 75% of which were represented only once. At this level of EST sampling, each tissue shared a very low percentage of transcripts (13-26%). The data obtained indicated that the genotypes shared common elements of drought stress as well as distinctly differential expression patterns that might be illustrative of their contrasting ability to tolerate water deficiencies. The new EST data generated here provide a highly diverse and rich source for gene discovery in wheat and other grasses."

The genome relationship dendrogram shows that D. breviaristatum and D. villosum could not be grouped together, indicating that D. breviaristatum was unlikely to be directly derived from D. villosum, while D. breviaristatum was closest to Thinopyrum intermedium, which implied that they might have similar breeding behaviors when introducing their chromatins into wheat. A D. breviaristatum genome specific RAPD product of 1182bp, was cloned and designated as pDb12H. Sequence analysis revealed that pDb12H was strongly homologuos to a long terminal repeat (LTR) Sabrina retrotransposon newly reported in Hordeum. The pDb12H was converted into a PCR based marker, which allows effectively monitoring the D. breviaristatum chromatin introgression into wheat. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) suggested that pDb12H was specifically hybridized throughout all D. breviaristatum chromosomes arms except for the terminal and centromeric regions, which can be used to characterize wheat -D. breviaristatum chromosome translocation. The genomes repetitive element will also be useful to study gene interactions between the wheat and alien genomes after the polyploidization."

"17522822","abstracttext","The viral gene for the killer protein 4 (KP4) has been explored for its antifungal effect in genetically modified wheat to defeat specifically the seed-transmitted smut and bunt diseases. In vitro both important seed-transmitted diseases of wheat, loose smut (Ustilago tritici) and stinking smut (Tilletia caries), are susceptible to KP4, whereas all other organisms tested so far proved to be not susceptible to KP4. For studies in planta we used stinking smut as a model fungus. In greenhouse experiments, two KP4-transgenic wheat lines showed up to 30% lower symptom development as compared to the nontransgenic control. As the last step in the proof of concept, field-testing has shown for the first time increased fungal resistance of a transgene in wheat. Due to its specificity against smuts and bunts, KP4 presents a very low risk to humans and the environment. Field-testing in Switzerland is regulated by a strong law, which for research is acceptable if legally and scientifically correctly applied."

"17496969","abstracttext","The present work was undertaken to formulate an effective bioformulation using Burkholderia sp. strain MSSP, a known plant-growth-promoting rhizobacterium. MSSP was tagged with the reporter gene of green fluorescent protein (gfp) to monitor its population in cost-effective solid carriers, including sugarcane-bagasse, sawdust, cocoa peat, rice husk, wheat bran, charcoal, and rock phosphate, and paneer-whey as liquid carrier. Physical and chemical properties of different low-cost carrier materials were studied. The viability of the green fluorescent tagged variant of MSSP was estimated in different sterile carrier materials. Whey and wheat bran proved to be efficient carrier materials for the bioformulation. Sawdust, rock phosphate, rice husk, and cocoa peat were average, while charcoal and sugarcane-bagasse proved to be inferior carriers. The viability of strain MSSP was also assessed in wheat bran and whey-based consortium, having three other bacterial strains, namely Sinorhizobium meliloti PP3, Rhizobium leguminosarum Pcc, and Bacillus sp. strain B1. Presence of other plant-growth-promoting bacteria did not have any detrimental effect on the viability of MSSP. Efficiency of the wheat-bran-based multispecies consortium was studied on the growth of pigeonpea in field conditions. A considerable increase in plant biomass, nodule number and weight, and number of pods was recorded as compared with individual trials and with the control."

"16699565","abstracttext","The production of quorum-sensing-related signal molecules (QSRMs) among culturable bacteria comprising the community on wheat heads was investigated. The taxonomic position of 186 bacterial isolates obtained from ten heads was inferred based on 16S rRNA gene sequences, and their QSRM production was determined using two bioreporter strains of N-acylhomoserine lactones. Approximately 33% of isolates produced QSRMs, though the proportion of QSRM-producing isolates on a wheat head was significantly negatively correlated with population size. Most of the producing isolates were Pantoea species, most commonly Pantoea ananatis. Furthermore, the proportion of Pantoea ananatis that produced QSRMs was significantly negatively correlated with the number of bacterial genera (community richness) on each head. Finally, community richness was positively correlated with population size. Qualitative analysis using thin-layer-chromatography revealed that the QSRMs of Pantoea isolates were composed of at least two compounds. This is the first report indicating that Pantoea ananatis isolates inhabiting wheat heads are capable of producing QSRMs. QSRM production by Pantoea spp. may contribute to the predominance of this genus on wheat heads, particularly at relatively low population densities and community diversity."
"17934784","articletitle","Large scale transcriptome analysis of the effects of nitrogen nutrition on accumulation of stem carbohydrate reserves in reproductive stage wheat."
"17934784","abstracttext","We investigated the molecular basis of the long-term adaptation to nitrogen (N) limitation of wheat plants grown in a simulated crop canopy, with a focus on the stage when carbon (C) reserves are accumulated in stems for later remobilization to grain. A cDNA microarray representing approximately 36,000 unique sequences was used to compare gene expression in a number of above-ground organs at anthesis. Fructan accumulation in stems was accompanied by elevated transcripts for a suite of fructosyltransferases (FTs) and for a fructan 6-exohydrolase (6-FEH) in the low N compared to high N stems. Clustering analysis identified a grouping that included several FTs and a number of genes thought to be involved in regulation of storage C metabolism or senescence in other systems. Transcripts for three FTs and for 6-FEH increased, while transcripts for 1-FEH decreased, in sucrose-fed wheat stems compared to controls. The opposite trends were seen for these transcripts in wheat stems fed ABA. Of the putative regulators, only transcripts for the WPK4 kinase increased in response to sucrose, suggesting a role for this kinase in C storage metabolism in the reproductive wheat stems grown in low N. This work represents the first large-scale transcriptome study of responses to the most common nutrient limitation in one of the world's most economically important crops."

"20186453","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. To isolate defense-related genes against the pathogen, a suppression subtractive hybridization library was constructed for an incompatible interaction. From the library, 652 sequences were determined to be unigenes, of which 31 were determined as genes involved in signal transduction and 77 were predicted to encode defense-related proteins. Expression patterns of 12 selected signal transduction and defense-related genes were determined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Signal transduction genes started increasing their expression at 12 h post inoculation (hpi), and expressions of the most of the transport and resistance-related genes were induced at 18 hpi. The gene expression results indicate specific molecular and cellular activities during the incompatible interaction between wheat and the stripe rust pathogen. In general, the expression increase of wheat signal transduction genes soon after inoculation with the pathogen inducing various defense-related genes, including reactive oxygen species, ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, pathogenesis-related proteins, and genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. The activities of these defense genes work in a sequential and concerted manner to result in a hypersensitive response."

"19911160","abstracttext","Puroindoline a and b proteins soften the endosperm of wheat kernels. When the underlying puroindoline genes are altered by mutation or are deleted, kernels become harder. Thus, puroindoline a and b (Pina and Pinb) play an important role in wheat quality and utilization. Recently, additional Pinb genes have been reported. In the present report, we provide corroborating coding and additional 5' and 3' flanking sequence for three Pinb variants: Pinb-2v1, Pinb-2v2, and Pinb-2v3. Additionally, a new Pinb variant, Pinb-2v4, is reported. All four variants were physically mapped using Chinese Spring (CS) diteolosomics, nullisomic-tetrasomics, and CS-Cheyenne disomic substitution lines. Results place Pinb-2v1 on 7DL, Pinb-2v2 on 7BL, Pinb-2v3 on 7B, and Pinb-2v4 on 7AL. Pinb-2v1 and Pinb-2v4 were present in all cvs. examined: CS, Cheyenne, Recital, Wichita and Winsome. Pinb-2v2 was present in CS and Recital; Pinb-2v3 was present in Cheyenne, Wichita, and Winsome. These results are not wholly consistent with prior research and additional studies will be required to reconcile discrepancies. The discovery of Pinb-2v4 and the mapping of all four variants will contribute to a better understanding of gene duplication events in wheat and their bearing on wheat kernel texture and grain utilization."

"20589616","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression by translational repression or transcript degradation. A large number of miRNAs have been identified from model plant species; however, the character of conserved miRNAs is poorly understood. We studied 42 miRNA families that are conserved within the plant kingdom, using the miRBase database. Some conserved miRNA families were found to be preferentially expressed in dicots relative to monocots, especially miR403, miR472 and miR479. Using an improved homology search-based approach and the conserved miRNAs as the query set, 34 conserved miRNAs and the miR482 family were identified in wheat. Forty-six wheat mRNAs were predicted as their putative target genes. Most conserved wheat miRNAs were found to retain homologous target interactions and have analogous molecular functions. The miR172 displayed a wheat-specific function and was found to have an additional target interaction with succinyl-CoA ligase. We concluded that although miRNAs are conserved, the expression and function of some have drifted during long periods of plant evolution."

"20483187","abstracttext","A Fusarium graminearum clade 7 specific real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay was developed in this study based on unique polymorphisms in sequences of the mating type protein (MAT) gene. PCR amplification was not observed in eight phylogenetic lineages of the F. graminearum complex and four other closely related Fusarium species. Accuracy of the quantification of the real-time PCR assay was verified with wheat DNA spiked with F. graminearum clade 7 DNA. Wheat samples representing two Canadian wheat classes, CWRS (Canadian Western Red Spring) and CWRW (Canadian Western Red Winter) were used to determine the relationships among F. graminearum DNA, deoxynivalenol (DON) and Fusarium damaged kernel (FDK). The amount of DON and F. graminearum DNA remaining after removal of FDK varied among samples, but was sometimes substantial. Positive correlations were observed between F. graminearum clade 7 DNA (in picograms) and DON as well as FDK. There was also a strong correlation between FDK and DON in CWRS and CWRW wheat composite samples, but the inherent variability in individual producer samples precluded a definitive correlation. For barley, a positive correlation was observed between Fusarium DNA and DON values. Real-time PCR assays can be a valuable tool for barley as there are no reliable symptoms to visually assess the level of Fusarium head blight in this crop."

The molecular mechanism underlying this difference was previously unexplored. This study employs a comparative genomics approach to identify analogous and contrasting gene expression patterns between rice and barley."
"19706179","abstracttext_results","A hierarchical clustering approach identified several interesting expression trajectories among rice and barley genotypes. There were no major conserved expression patterns between the two species in response to salt stress. A wheat salt-stress dataset was queried for comparison with rice and barley. Roughly one-third of the salt-stress responses of barley were conserved with wheat while overlap between wheat and rice was minimal. These results demonstrate that, at transcriptome level, rice is strikingly different compared to the more closely related barley and wheat. This apparent lack of analogous transcriptional programs in response to salt stress is further highlighted through close examination of genes associated with root growth and development."

"21946233","abstracttext","Gliadins are seed storage proteins which are characterized by high intervarietal polymorphism and can be used as genetic markers. As a result of our work, a considerably extended catalogue of allelic variants of gliadin component blocks was compiled for durum wheat; 74 allelic variants for four gliadin-coding loci were identified for the first time. The extended catalogue includes a total of 131 allelic variants: 16 for locus Gli-A1(d), 19 for locus Gli-B1(d), 41 for locus Gli-A2(d), and 55 for locus Gli-B2(d). The electrophoretic pattern of the standard cultivar and a diagram are provided for every block identified. The number of alleles per family is quite small for loci Gli-A1(d) and Gli-B1(d) of durum wheat, as contrasted to loci Gli-A2(d) and Gli-B2(d) that are characterized by large families including many alleles. The presence of large block families determines a higher diversity of durum wheat for loci Gli-A2(d) and Gli-B2(d) as compared to Gli-A1(d) and Gli-B1(d). The catalogue of allelic variants of gliadin component blocks can be used by seed farmers to identify durum wheat cultivars and evaluate their purity; by breeders, to obtain homogenous cultivars and control the initial stages of selection; by gene bank experts, to preserve native varieties and the original biotypic composition of cultivars."

"21585270","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum causes head blight disease in wheat and barley. To help understand the infection process on wheat, we studied global gene expression of F. graminearum in a time series from 24 to 196 h after inoculation, compared with a noninoculated control. The infection was rapid and, after 48 h, over 4,000 fungal genes were expressed. The number of genes expressed increased over time up to 96 h (>8,000 genes), and then declined at the 144- and 192-h post-inoculation time points. After subtraction of genes found expressed on complete medium, during carbon or nitrogen starvation, and on barley, only 355 were found exclusively expressed in wheat, mostly genes with unknown function (72.6%). These genes were mainly found in single-nucleotide polymorphism-enriched islands on the chromosomes, suggesting a higher evolutionary selection pressure. The annotated genes were enriched in functional groups predicted to be involved in allantoin and allantoate transport, detoxification, nitrogen, sulfur and selenium metabolism, secondary metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and degradation of polysaccharides and ester compounds. Several putative secreted virulence factors were also found expressed in wheat."

"21980935","abstracttext","The fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis causes tan spot, a wheat leaf disease of worldwide importance. The pathogen produces three host-selective toxins, including Ptr ToxB, which causes chlorophyll degradation and foliar chlorosis on toxin-sensitive wheat genotypes. The ToxB gene, which codes for Ptr ToxB, was silenced in a wild-type race 5 isolate of the fungus thorough a sense- and antisense-mediated silencing mechanism. Toxin production by the silenced strains was evaluated in culture filtrates of the fungus via Western blotting analysis, and plant bioassays were conducted to test the virulence of the transformants in planta. The chlorosis-inducing ability of the silenced strains was correlated with the quantity of Ptr ToxB, and transformants in which toxin production was strongly decreased also caused very little disease on toxin-sensitive wheat genotypes. Cytological analysis of the infection process revealed that, in addition to a reduced capacity to induce chlorosis, the silenced strains with the greatest decrease in the levels of Ptr ToxB produced significantly fewer appressoria than the wild-type isolate, 12 and 24 h after inoculation onto wheat leaves. The results provide strong support for the suggestion that the amount of Ptr ToxB protein produced by fungal isolates plays a significant role in the quantitative variation in the virulence of P. tritici-repentis."

"19513813","abstracttext","Methylglyoxal is a kind of poisonous metabolite that can react with RNA, DNA and protein, which generally results in a number of side advert effects to cell. Glyoxalase I is a member of glyoxalase system that can detoxify methylglyoxal. An EST encoding a glyoxalase I was isolated from a SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization)-cDNA library of wheat spike inoculated by Fusarium graminearum. The corresponding full length gene, named TaGly I, was cloned, sequenced and characterized. Its genomic sequence consists of 2,719 bp, including seven exons and six introns, and its coding sequence is 929 bp with an open reading frame encoding 291 amino acids. Sequence alignment showed that there were two glyoxalase I domains in the deduced protein sequence. By using specific primers, TaGly I was mapped to chromosome 7D of wheat via a set of durum wheat 'Langdon' D-genome disomic-substitution lines. The result of Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that TaGly I was induced by the inoculation of Fusarium graminearum in wheat spikes. Additionally, it was also induced by high concentration of NaCl and ZnCl2. When TaGly I was overexpressed in tobacco leaves via Agrobacterium tumefaciens infection, the transgenic tobacco showed stronger tolerance to ZnCl2 stress relative to transgenic control with GFP. The above facts indicated that TaGly I might play a role in response to diverse stresses in plants."

"19499258","abstracttext","The small RNA transcriptomes of bread wheat and its emerging model Brachypodium distachyon were obtained by using deep sequencing technology. Small RNA compositions were analyzed in these two species. In addition to 70 conserved microRNAs (miRNAs) from 25 families, 23 novel wheat miRNAs were identified. For Brachypodium, 12 putative miRNAs were predicted from a limited number of expressed sequence tags, of which one was a potential novel miRNA. Also, 94 conserved miRNAs from 28 families were identified in this species. Expression validation was performed for several novel wheat miRNAs. RNA ligase-mediated 5' rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends experiments demonstrated their capability to cleave predicted target genes including three disease-resistant gene analogs. Differential expression of miRNAs was observed between Brachypodium vegetative and reproductive tissues, suggesting their different roles at the two growth stages. Our work significantly increases the novel miRNA numbers in wheat and provides the first set of small RNAs in B. distachyon."

"20691208","abstracttext","Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) is a newly emerging pathogen affecting wheat production in China. A real-time PCR method using the TaqMan probe is described for quantitative detection of WDV in wheat tissues and in leafhopper (Psammotettix alienus Dahlb.). Primers and probes for specific detection of WDV were designed within the conserved region of the coat protein (CP) gene sequence. A sensitivity assay showed the detection limit of the assay was 30 copies, and the standard curve was linear over range 30-3 × 10(6) copies, with good reproducibility. Simultaneously, this real-time PCR assay could be used to detect WDV CP genes in viruliferous leafhoppers. As determined by an end-point dilution comparison, real-time PCR was close to 10(4)-fold more sensitive than the indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for WDV detection. Field samples of wheat and leafhopper collected from different regions of China were detected by both real-time PCR and gel-based PCR. The results showed more positive samples could be identified by real-time PCR than by gel-based PCR. This quantitative detection assay provides a valuable tool for diagnosis and molecular studies of WDV biology."

"21732241","abstracttext","A novel promoter from a hemolysin-like protein encoding the gene, hlyA, was characterized for protein overexpression in Aspergillus oryzae grown in solid-state culture. Using endo-1,4-β-glucanase from A. oryzae (CelA) as the reporter, promoter activity was found to be higher than that of the α-amylase (amyA) and manganese superoxide dismutase (sodM) genes not only in wheat bran solid-state culture but also in liquid culture. Expression of the A. oryzae endoglucanase CelB and two heterologous endoglucanases (TrEglI and TrEglIII from Trichoderma reesei) under the control of the hlyA promoter were also found to be stronger than under the control of the amyA promoter in A. oryzae grown in wheat bran solid-state culture, suggesting that the hlyA promoter may be useful for the overproduction of other proteins as well. In wheat bran solid-state culture, the productivity of the hlyA promoter in terms of protein produced was high when the cultivation temperature was 30°C or 37°C, when the water content was 0.6 or 0.8 ml/g wheat bran, and from 48 to 72 h after inoculation. Because A. oryzae sporulated actively under these conditions and because hemolysin has been reported to play a role in fungal fruiting body formation, high-level expression of hlyA may be related to sporulation."

"22311372","abstracttext","Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) enzymatic activity is a major cause in time-dependent discoloration in wheat dough products. The PPO-A1 and PPO-D1 genes have been shown to contribute to wheat kernel PPO activity. Recently a novel PPO gene family consisting of the PPO-A2, PPO-B2, and PPO-D2 genes has been identified and shown to be expressed in wheat kernels. In this study, the sequences of these five kernel PPO genes were determined for the spring wheat cultivars Louise and Penawawa. The two cultivars were found to be polymorphic at each of the PPO loci. Three novel alleles were isolated from Louise. The Louise X Penawawa mapping population was used to genetically map all five PPO genes. All map to the long arm of homeologous group 2 chromosomes. PPO-A2 was found to be located 8.9 cM proximal to PPO-A1 on the long arm of chromosome 2A. Similarly, PPO-D1 and PPO-D2 were separated by 10.7 cM on the long arm of chromosome 2D. PPO-B2 mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2B and was the site of a novel QTL for polyphenol oxidase activity. Five other PPO QTL were identified in this study. One QTL corresponds to the previously described PPO-D1 locus, one QTL corresponds to the PPO-D2 locus, whereas the remaining three are located on chromosome 2B."

"22326479","abstracttext","Rolling Circle Amplification (RCA) of DNA is a sensitive and cost effective method for the rapid identification of pathogenic fungi without the need for sequencing. Amplification products can be visualized on 1% agarose gel to verify the specificity of probe-template binding or directly by adding fluorescent dyes. Fusarium Head Blight (FHB) is currently the world's largest threat to the production of cereal crops with the production of a range of mycotoxins as an additional risk. We designed sets of RCA padlock probes based on polymorphisms in the elongation factor 1-α (EF-1α) gene to detect the dominant FHB species, comprising lineages of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC). The method also enabled the identification of species of the Fusarium oxysporum (FOSC), the Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti (FIESC), and the Fusarium tricinctum (FTSC) species complexes, and used strains from the CBS culture collection as reference. Subsequently probes were applied to characterize isolates from wheat and wild grasses, and inoculated wheat kernels. The RCA assays successfully amplified DNA of the target fungi, both in environmental samples and in the contaminated wheat samples, while no cross reactivity was observed with uncontaminated wheat or related Fusarium species. As RCA does not require expensive instrumentation, the technique has a good potential for local and point of care screening for toxigenic Fusarium species in cereals."

"23212773","abstracttext","As a strategy to increase the seed dormancy of soft white wheat, mutants with increased sensitivity to the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) were identified in mutagenized grain of soft white spring wheat ""Zak"". Lack of seed dormancy is correlated with increased susceptibility to preharvest sprouting in wheat, especially those cultivars with white kernels. ABA induces seed dormancy during embryo maturation and inhibits the germination of mature grain. Three mutant lines called Zak ERA8, Zak ERA19A, and Zak ERA19B (Zak ENHANCED RESPONSE to ABA) were recovered based on failure to germinate on 5 μM ABA. All three mutants resulted in increased ABA sensitivity over a wide range of concentrations such that a phenotype can be detected at very low ABA concentrations. Wheat loses sensitivity to ABA inhibition of germination with extended periods of dry after-ripening. All three mutants recovered required more time to after-ripen sufficiently to germinate in the absence of ABA and to lose sensitivity to 5 μM ABA. However, an increase in ABA sensitivity could be detected after as long as 3 years of after-ripening using high ABA concentrations. The Zak ERA8 line showed the strongest phenotype and segregated as a single semi-dominant mutation. This mutation resulted in no obvious decrease in yield and is a good candidate gene for breeding preharvest sprouting tolerance."

Using direct crossing, two genes for resistance to the African stem rust fungus race TTKSK (Ug99), were transferred from the Ae. tauschii accessions TA10187 and TA10171 to an elite hard winter wheat line, KS05HW14. BC2 mapping populations were created concurrently with developing advanced backcross lines carrying rust resistance. Bulked segregant analysis on the BC2 populations identified marker loci on 6DS and 7DS linked to stem rust resistance genes transferred from TA10187 and TA10171, respectively. Linkage maps were developed for both genes and closely linked markers reported in this study will be useful for selection and pyramiding with other Ug99-effective stem rust resistance genes.

"23877092","abstracttext","The present study focused on the elemental distribution in the developing wheat grain by using the laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) imaging technique. Our studies show that the embryo accumulated high concentrations of nutrient elements, such as Fe, K, Cu, and Zn, while Ca was accumulated in the bran of the wheat grain which might be attributed to its function of structural maintenance. In the endosperm the majority of the nutrients were located in the aleurone layer. Within the grain, the embryo could be considered as a nutrient pool for macro- and micro-elements essential for the development of the seedling. Elemental images showed that considerable amounts of nutrients were stored in the scutellum of the embryo, which might be related to the high gene expression of element transporters in the scutellum. Root primordia and leaf primordia were enriched in particular elements, such as Mn and Zn respectively. In total 34 cross sections were analyzed and used for generation of a sequence of elemental distribution images to demonstrate elemental changes along the perpendicular axis of the wheat grain embryo. Further development of three-dimensional modeling will be combined with physiological studies to better understand the mechanisms of elemental distribution and storage in the wheat grain. These studies will provide fundamental knowledge on improving the nutritional value and agronomic practices."

Blood glucose response areas after an oral glucose tolerance test were significantly lower after AX (mean ± SEM; 2117 ± 170 mmol/L·180 min), RM (1978 ± 206 mmol/L·180 min), and RK (2234 ± 262 mmol/L·180 min) breads than after WB (3586 ± 100 mmol/L·180 min; p < 0.0001). AX, RK, and RM changed expressions of adipose GAPDH, AMPK, FAS, SREBP-1c, and hepatic PCG-1α, whereas BG had similar effects as WB. Thus, arabinoxylan added to wheat bread had beneficial effects on glycemic control as whole grain rye bread in this animal model."

"24750250","abstracttext","Natural resistance of wheat plants to wheat sharp eyespot is inadequate, and new strategies for controlling the disease are required. Biological control is an alternative and attractive way of reducing the use of chemicals in agriculture. In this study, we investigated the biocontrol properties of endophytic bacterium Bacillus cereus strain 0-9, which was isolated from the root systems of healthy wheat varieties. The phosphotransferase system is a major regulator of carbohydrate metabolism in bacteria. Enzyme I is one of the protein components of this system. Specific disruption and complementation of the enzyme I-coding gene ptsI from B. cereus was achieved through homologous recombination. Disruption of ptsI in B. cereus caused a 70% reduction in biofilm formation, a 30.4% decrease in biocontrol efficacy, and a 1000-fold reduction in colonization. The growth of ΔptsI mutant strain on G-tris synthetic medium containing glucose as the exclusive carbon source was also reduced. Wild-type properties could be restored to the ΔptsI mutant strain by ptsI complementation. These results suggested that ptsI may be one of the key genes involved in biofilm formation, colonization, and biocontrol of B. cereus and that B. cereus wild-type strain 0-9 may be an ideal biocontrol agent for controlling wheat sharp eyespot."

"24624956","abstracttext","Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) is a major disease of wheat. We tested aqueous leaf extracts of Jacaranda mimosifolia (Bignoniaceae), Thevetia peruviana (Apocynaceae), and Calotropis procera (Apocynaceae) for their ability to protect wheat from leaf rust. Extracts from all three species inhibited P. triticina urediniospore germination in vitro. Plants sprayed with extracts before inoculation developed significantly lower levels of disease incidence (number of plants infected) than unsprayed, inoculated controls. Sprays combining 0.6% leaf extracts and 2 mM salicylic acid with the fungicide Amistar Xtra at 0.05% (azoxystrobin at 10 μg/liter + cyproconazole at 4 μg/liter) reduced disease incidence significantly more effectively than sprays of fungicide at 0.1% alone. Extracts of J. mimosifolia were most active, either alone (1.2%) or in lower doses (0.6%) in combination with 0.05% Amistar Xtra. Leaf extracts combined with fungicide strongly stimulated defense-related gene expression and the subsequent accumulation of pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins in the apoplast of inoculated wheat leaves. The level of protection afforded was significantly correlated with the ability of extracts to increase PR protein expression. We conclude that pretreatment of wheat leaves with spray formulations containing previously untested plant leaf extracts enhances protection against leaf rust provided by fungicide sprays, offering an alternative disease management strategy."

"24130825","abstracttext","Resistance to pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) is an important objective for the genetic improvement of many cereal crops, including wheat. Resistance, or susceptibility, to PHS is mainly influenced by seed dormancy, a complex trait. Reduced seed dormancy is the most important aspect of seed germination on a spike prior to harvesting, but it is influenced by various environmental factors including light, temperature and abiotic stresses. The basic genetic framework of seed dormancy depends on the antagonistic action of abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellic acid (GA) to promote dormancy and germination. Recent studies have revealed a role for epigenetic changes, predominantly histone modifications, in controlling seed dormancy. To investigate the role of DNA methylation in seed dormancy, we explored the role of ARGONAUTE4_9 class genes in seed development and dormancy in wheat. Our results indicate that the two wheat AGO4_9 class genes i.e. AGO802 and AGO804 map to chromosomes 3L and 1L are preferentially expressed in the embryos of developing seeds [corrected]. Differential expressions of AGO802-B in the embryos of PHS resistant and susceptible varieties also relates with DNA polymorphism in various wheat varieties due to an insertion of a SINE-like element into this gene. DNA methylation patterns of the embryonic tissue from six PHS resistant and susceptible varieties demonstrate a correlation with this polymorphism. These results suggest a possible role for AGO802-B in seed dormancy and PHS resistance through the modulation of DNA methylation."

"24213661","abstracttext","Transient expression of β-glucuronidase (GUS) in different cellular compartments following biolistic delivery of chloroplast or nuclear expression vectors into wheat leaves or calli, derived from anther culture or immature embryos, is reported here. When pB1121, the nuclear GUS vector, was used to bombard wheat cells, the β-glucuronidase product, an insoluble indigo dye, was observed evenly throughout the cytosol. But, when the chloroplast expression vector pHD203-GUS was used for bombardments, the indigo dye (GUS product) was subcellularly localized within the chloroplasts of wheat cells. The observation of GUS expression in albino plastids, when anther culture derived albino leaves were bombarded with the chloroplast expression vector pHD203-GUS, suggests the presence of a functional protein synthetic machinery in these organelles. GUS expression was also observed in regenerable calli derived from wheat immature embryos bombarded with pHD203-GUS. Leaves or calli bombarded with pUC19, as negative controls, did not show any GUS expression. These results constitute the first demonstration of foreign gene expression in chloroplasts of a monocot and that a dicot chloroplast promoter functions in a monocot chloroplast."

"24497330","abstracttext_background","Quality is an important determinant in wheat breeding since its genetic background is less affected by the environment and sufficiently influences the commercial value of a cultivar. Thus, if a certain cultivar possesses some specific allele combination at crucial loci, then it appears quite possible to exhibit valuable qualitative traits in terms of end-product quality. This is also true if either durum or bread wheat germplasm is involved."
"24497330","abstracttext_results","Biochemical investigation of the wheat germplasm gives important information on the allele constitution of a cultivar, with reference to either the quality or its resistance to stressing factors. The last is crucial since it affects the safe use of this cultivar. The Hellenic wheat germplasm possesses valuable allele combination or chromosome constitution (presence of the 1BL.1RS translocation, which is verified by the presence of a certain allele) with reference to quality. Genotypes having the aforementioned translocation exhibit excellent resistance to various stressing factors, but have a serious handicap, i.e. inferior bread-making quality. This negative effect on quality, although influenced by the genotype, can be overcome if some other alleles are present in a cultivar."
"24497330","abstracttext_conclusion","The Hellenic cultivar Acheron is a good example since, despite the presence of the translocation, it also has very good bread-making quality and high yielding ability. It must be also mentioned that most of the Hellenic durum germplasm carries the gene locus Gli-B1 component, similar to γ45, which can be considered as an index of good end-product quality."

"24193381","abstracttext","Three lines derived from wheat (6x) x Agropyron elongatum (10x) that are resistant to wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) were analyzed by chromosome pairing, banding, and in situ hybridization. Line CI15321 was identified as a disomic substitution line where wheat chromosome 1D is replaced by Ag. elongatum chromosome 1Ae-1. Line 87-94-1 is a wheat-Ag. elongatum ditelosomic addition 1Ae-1L. Line CI15322 contains an Ag. elongatum chromosome, 1Ae-2, that substitutes for chromosome 1D. The short arm of 1Ae-2 paired with the short arm of 1Ae-1 at metaphase I (MI) in 82% of the pollen mother cells (PMCs). However, the long arms of these two chromosomes did not pair with each other. In CI15322, the long arm of chromosome 4D has an Agropyron chromosome segment which was derived from the distal part of 1Ae-1L. This translocation chromosome is designated as T4DS·4DL-1L. T4DS·4DL-1Ae-1L has a 0.73 μm distal part of the long arm of 4D replaced by a 1.31 μm distal segment from 1Ae-1L. The major WSMV resistance gene(s) in these lines is located on the distal part of 1Ae-1L."

"24196051","articletitle","Comparative RFLP maps of the homoeologous group-2 chromosomes of wheat, rye and barley."
"24196051","abstracttext","Genetic maps of the homoeologous group-2 chromosomes were constructed, comprising 114 loci in wheat and 34 loci in rye. These include the genes coding for sucrose synthase, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase, a bZIP protein (EmBP-1), a peroxidase and an abscisic acid-induced protein (#7). Overall, gene orders are highly conserved in the genomes of wheat, barley and rye, except for the distal ends of chromosome arms 2BS and 2RS, which are involved in interchromosomal, probably evolutionary, translocations. Clustering of loci in the centromeric regions of the maps, resulting from the concentration of recombination events in the distal chromosomal regions, is observed in wheat and rye, but not in barley. Furthermore, loci for which homoeoloci can be detected in rye and barley tend to lie in the centromeric regions of the maps, while non-homoeologous and wheat-specific loci tend to be more evenly distributed over the genetic maps. Mapping of the group-2 chromosomes in the intervarietal 'Timgalen' x 'RL4137' cross revealed that the T. timopheevi chromosome segment introgressed into chromosome 2B in 'Timgalen' is preferentially transmitted. Recombination is also greatly reduced in that segment."

In this study, fifty-four wheat DHN unigenes were identified in the expressed sequence tags database. These genes encode seven types of dehydrins (KS, SK3, YSK2, Y2SK2, Kn, Y2SK3, and YSK3) and separate in 32 homologous clusters. The gene amplification differed among the dehydrin types, and members of the YSK2- and Kn-type DHNs are more numerous in wheat than in other cereals. The relative expression of all of these DHN clusters was analyzed using an in silico method in seven tissue types (i.e. normal growing shoots, roots, and reproductive tissues; developing and germinating seeds; drought- and cold-stressed shoots) as well as semi-quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in seedling leaves and roots treated by dehydration, cold, and salt, respectively. The role of the ABA pathway in wheat DHN expression regulation was analyzed. Transcripts of certain types of DHNs accumulated specifically according to tissue type and treatment, which suggests their differentiated roles in wheat abiotic stress tolerance."

Protein-based nanoparticles are preferred for therapeutic drug and gene delivery owing to their biocompatibility and ability to load various types of drugs. However, proteins such as a collagen and albumin are unstable in aqueous environments and are not ideal for drug delivery applications. Wheat glutenin has been demonstrated to be biocompatible and have good stability under aqueous conditions. Films and fibers have been made from wheat glutenin for medical applications but there are no reports on developing micro- or nanoparticles. In this research, wheat glutenin nanoparticles (70-140 nm) were prepared and the stability of the nanoparticles under various physiological conditions was investigated. Nanoparticles were fluorescently labeled and later injected into mice and the ability of the nanoparticles to penetrate into the cells in various organs was studied. Strong acidic or alkaline conditions provided glutenin nanoparticles with low diameters and the particles were more stable under the pH 7 rather than pH of 4. Glutenin nanoparticles were predominantly found in the liver in mice. Our in vivo and in vitro studies suggest that glutenin nanoparticles are suitable for drug delivery applications."

"25603169","abstracttext","Wheat bran offers health benefits as a baking ingredient, but is detrimental to bread textural quality. Dextran production by microbial fermentation improves sourdough bread volume and freshness, but extensive acid production during fermentation may negate this effect. Enzymatic production of dextran in wheat bran was tested to determine if dextran-containing bran could be used in baking without disrupting bread texture. The Weissella confusa VTT E-90392 dextransucrase gene was sequenced and His-tagged dextransucrase Wc392-rDSR was produced in Lactococcus lactis. Purified enzyme was characterized using (14)C-sucrose radioisotope and reducing value-based assays, the former yielding K(m) and V(max) values of 14.7 mM and 8.2 μmol/(mg ∙ min), respectively, at the pH optimum of 5.4. The structure and size of in vitro dextran product was similar to dextran produced in vivo. Dextran (8.1% dry weight) was produced in wheat bran in 6 h using Wc392-rDSR. Bran with and without dextran was used in wheat baking at 20% supplementation level. Dextran presence improved bread softness and neutralized bran-induced volume loss, clearly demonstrating the potential of using dextransucrases in bran bioprocessing for use in baking."

"25344442","abstracttext","The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) plays crucial roles in adaptive responses of plants to abiotic stresses. ABA-responsive element binding proteins (AREBs) are basic leucine zipper transcription factors that regulate the expression of downstream genes containing ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) in promoter regions. A novel ABI-like (ABA-insensitive) transcription factor gene, named TaABL1, containing a conserved basic leucine zipper (bZIP) domain was cloned from wheat. Southern blotting showed that three copies were present in the wheat genome. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that TaABL1 belonged to the AREB subfamily of the bZIP transcription factor family and was most closely related to ZmABI5 in maize and OsAREB2 in rice. Expression of TaABL1 was highly induced in wheat roots, stems, and leaves by ABA, drought, high salt, and low temperature stresses. TaABL1 was localized inside the nuclei of transformed wheat mesophyll protoplast. Overexpression of TaABL1 enhanced responses of transgenic plants to ABA and hastened stomatal closure under stress, thereby improving tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. Furthermore, overexpression of TaABL1 upregulated or downregulated the expression of some stress-related genes controlling stomatal closure in transgenic plants under ABA and drought stress conditions, suggesting that TaABL1 might be a valuable genetic resource for transgenic molecular breeding."

"25346745","abstracttext","Flowering time is an important trait in wheat breeding as it affects adaptation and yield potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic architecture of flowering time in European winter bread wheat cultivars. To this end a population of 410 winter wheat varieties was evaluated in multi-location field trials and genotyped by a genotyping-by-sequencing approach and candidate gene markers. Our analyses revealed that the photoperiod regulator Ppd-D1 is the major factor affecting flowering time in this germplasm set, explaining 58% of the genotypic variance. Copy number variation at the Ppd-B1 locus was present but explains only 3.2% and thus a comparably small proportion of genotypic variance. By contrast, the plant height loci Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 had no effect on flowering time. The genome-wide scan identified six QTL which each explain only a small proportion of genotypic variance and in addition we identified a number of epistatic QTL, also with small effects. Taken together, our results show that flowering time in European winter bread wheat cultivars is mainly controlled by Ppd-D1 while the fine tuning to local climatic conditions is achieved through Ppd-B1 copy number variation and a larger number of QTL with small effects."

"25750648","abstracttext","Wheat kernels contain fructans, fructose based oligosaccharides with prebiotic properties, in levels between 2 and 35 weight % depending on the developmental stage of the kernel. To improve knowledge on the metabolic pathways leading to fructan storage and degradation, carbohydrate fluxes occurring during durum wheat kernel development were analyzed. Kernels were collected at various developmental stages and quali-quantitative analysis of carbohydrates (mono- and di-saccharides, fructans, starch) was performed, alongside analysis of the activities and gene expression of the enzymes involved in their biosynthesis and hydrolysis. High resolution HPAEC-PAD of fructan contained in durum wheat kernels revealed that fructan content is higher at the beginning of kernel development, when fructans with higher DP, such as bifurcose and 1,1-nystose, were mainly found. The changes in fructan pool observed during kernel maturation might be part of the signaling pathways influencing carbohydrate metabolism and storage in wheat kernels during development. During the first developmental stages fructan accumulation may contribute to make kernels more effective Suc sinks and to participate in osmotic regulation while the observed decrease in their content may mark the transition to later developmental stages, transition that is also orchestrated by changes in redox balance."

"26636660","abstracttext","Cereal fibres such as wheat bran are considered to offer human health benefits via their impact on the intestinal microbiota. We show here by 16S rRNA gene-based community analysis that providing amylase-pretreated wheat bran as the sole added energy source to human intestinal microbial communities in anaerobic fermentors leads to the selective and progressive enrichment of a small number of bacterial species. In particular, OTUs corresponding to uncultured Lachnospiraceae (Firmicutes) related to Eubacterium xylanophilum and Butyrivibrio spp. were strongly enriched (by five to 160 fold) over 48 h in four independent experiments performed with different faecal inocula, while nine other Firmicutes OTUs showed > 5-fold enrichment in at least one experiment. Ferulic acid was released from the wheat bran during degradation but was rapidly converted to phenylpropionic acid derivatives via hydrogenation, demethylation and dehydroxylation to give metabolites that are detected in human faecal samples. Pure culture work using bacterial isolates related to the enriched OTUs, including several butyrate-producers, demonstrated that the strains caused substrate weight loss and released ferulic acid, but with limited further conversion. We conclude that breakdown of wheat bran involves specialist primary degraders while the conversion of released ferulic acid is likely to involve a multi-species pathway."

Three resistance factors, QSng.sfr-3BS, Fhb1 and Sr2, conferring resistance, respectively, to SNB, FHB and SR, each from a unique donor line, were mapped previously to the short arm of wheat chromosome 3B. Based on published reports, our hypothesis was that Sr2 is the most distal, Fhb1 the most proximal and QSng.sfr-3BS is in between Sr2 and Fhb1 on wheat chromosome arm 3BS."

"27246757","abstracttext","The domestication of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice and barley has included the modification of inflorescence architecture to improve grain yield and ease harvesting(1). Yield increases have often been achieved through modifying the number and arrangement of spikelets, which are specialized reproductive branches that form part of the inflorescence. Multiple genes that control spikelet development have been identified in maize, rice and barley(2-5). However, little is known about the genetic underpinnings of this process in wheat. Here, we describe a modified spikelet arrangement in wheat, termed paired spikelets. Combining comprehensive QTL and mutant analyses, we show that Photoperiod-1 (Ppd-1), a pseudo-response regulator gene that controls photoperiod-dependent floral induction, has a major inhibitory effect on paired spikelet formation by regulating the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)(6,7). These findings show that modulated expression of the two important flowering genes, Ppd-1 and FT, can be used to form a wheat inflorescence with a more elaborate arrangement and increased number of grain producing spikelets."

We designed two sgRNAs to target a conserved region adjacent to the coding sequence for the 33-mer in the α-gliadin genes. Twenty-one mutant lines were generated, all showing strong reduction in α-gliadins. Up to 35 different genes were mutated in one of the lines of the 45 different genes identified in the wild type, while immunoreactivity was reduced by 85%. Transgene-free lines were identified, and no off-target mutations have been detected in any of the potential targets. The low-gluten, transgene-free wheat lines described here could be used to produce low-gluten foodstuff and serve as source material to introgress this trait into elite wheat varieties."

Using a wheat-based medium, the effects of abiotic factors, temperature and water activity (a W ), on growth, fumonisin biosynthesis, and expression of FUM genes were compared for three F. proliferatum strains isolated from durum wheat in Argentina. Although all isolates showed similar profiles of growth, the fumonisin production profiles were slightly different. Regarding FUM gene transcriptional control, both FUM8 and FUM19 expression showed similar behavior in all tested conditions. For both genes, expression at 25°C correlated with fumonisin production, regardless of the a w conditions. However, at 15°C, these two genes were as highly expressed as at 25°C although the amounts of toxin were very weak, suggesting that the kinetics of fumonisin production was slowed at 15°C. This study provides useful baseline data on conditions representing a low or a high risk for contamination of wheat kernels with fumonisins."

"28515732","abstracttext","Although, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) has been widely studied in mammalian cells because of its role in inhibiting apoptosis, its effects on plants remain almost unknown, especially in the case of crops such as wheat. In this study, we conducted a series of experiments to explore the effects and mechanisms of action of TUDCA on wheat growth and cell death induced by osmotic stress. Our results show that TUDCA: (1) ameliorates the impact of osmotic stress on wheat height, fresh weight, and water content; (2) alleviates the decrease in chlorophyll content as well as membrane damage caused by osmotic stress; (3) decreases the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes under osmotic stress; and (4) to some extent alleviates osmotic stress-induced cell death probably by regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related gene expression, for example expression of the basic leucine zipper genes bZIP60B and bZIP60D , the binding proteins BiP1 and BiP2 , the protein disulfide isomerase PDIL8-1 , and the glucose-regulated protein GRP94 . We also propose a model that illustrates how TUDCA alleviates osmotic stress-related wheat cell death, which provides an important theoretical basis for improving plant stress adaptation and elucidates the mechanisms of ER stress-related plant osmotic stress resistance."

"29312279","abstracttext","Termites are xylophages, being able to digest a wide variety of lignocellulosic biomass including wood with high lignin content. This ability to feed on recalcitrant plant material is the result of complex symbiotic relationships, which involve termite-specific gut microbiomes. Therefore, these represent a potential source of microorganisms for the bioconversion of lignocellulose in bioprocesses targeting the production of carboxylates. In this study, gut microbiomes of four termite species were studied for their capacity to degrade wheat straw and produce carboxylates in controlled bioreactors. All of the gut microbiomes successfully degraded lignocellulose and up to 45% w/w of wheat straw degradation was observed, with the Nasutitermes ephratae gut-microbiome displaying the highest levels of wheat straw degradation, carboxylate production and enzymatic activity. Comparing the 16S rRNA gene diversity of the initial gut inocula to the bacterial communities in lignocellulose degradation bioreactors revealed important changes in community diversity. In particular, taxa such as Spirochaetes and Fibrobacteres that were highly abundant in the initial gut inocula were replaced by Firmicutes and Proteobacteria at the end of incubation in wheat straw bioreactors. Overall, this study demonstrates that termite-gut microbiomes constitute a reservoir of lignocellulose-degrading bacteria that can be harnessed in artificial conditions for biomass conversion processes that lead to the production of useful molecules."

"29225611","abstracttext","As a superfamily of transcription factors, the tryptophan-arginine-lysine-tyrosine (WRKY) transcription factors have been found to be essential for abiotic and biotic stress responses in plants. Currently, only 76 WRKY transcription factors in wheat could be identified in the NCBI database, among which only a few have been functionally analyzed. Herein, a total of 188 WRKY transcription factors were identified from the wheat genome database, which included 123 full-length coding sequences, and all of them were used for detailed evolution studies. By bioinformatics analysis, a WRKY transcription factor, named TaWRKY146 , was found to be the homologous gene of AtWRKY46 , overexpression of which leads to hypersensitivity to drought and salt stress in Arabidopsis . Consequently, the full length of TaWRKY146 was cloned, and the expression levels of TaWRKY146 were found significantly up-regulated in the leaves and roots of wheat seedlings, which were subjected to osmotic stress. Overexpression of TaWRKY146 in Arabidopsis was shown to enhance drought tolerance by the induction of stomatal closure that reduced the transpiration rate. All these results provide a firm foundation for further identification of WRKY transcription factors with important functions in wheat."

In this study, an endophytic bacterium, Bacillus velezensis CC09, labeled with green fluorescent protein, was tested for its colonization, migration, and expression of genes encoding iturin A synthetase within wheat tissues and organs as well as for protective effects against wheat take-all and spot blotch diseases. The results showed that strain CC09 not only formed biofilm on the root surface but was also widely distributed in almost every tissue, including the epidermis, cortex, and xylem vessels, and even migrated to stems and leaves, resulting in 66.67% disease-control efficacy (DCE) of take-all and 21.64% DCE of spot blotch. Moreover, the gene cluster encoding iturin A synthase under the control of the p itu promoter is expressed in B. velezensis CC09 in wheat tissues, which indicates that iturin A might contribute to the in-vivo antifungal activity and leads to the disease control.

Differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were analyzed based on Gene Ontology classifications, metabolic pathways and transcriptional regulation networks using Blast2GO. We identified 5570 proteins based on 23,277 peptides, which matched with 73,688 spectra, including proteins in key pathways such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase and 6-phosphofructokinase 1 in the glycolysis pathway, isocitrate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-dehydrogenase and adenosine-triphosphate (ATP) synthases in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. These proteins may comprise a network that regulates male sterility in wheat. Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis, ATP assays and total sugar assays validated the iTRAQ results. These DAPs could be associated with abnormal pollen grain formation and male sterility. Our findings provide insights into the molecular mechanism related to male sterility in wheat."

"29319512","abstracttext","Halophyte microbiome contributes significantly to plant performance and can provide information regarding complex ecological processes involved in osmoregulation of these plants. The objective of this study is to investigate the microbiomes associated with belowground (rhizosphere), internal (endosphere) and aboveground (phyllosphere) tissues of halophyte (Salsola stocksii) through metagenomics approach. Plant samples were collected from Khewra Salt Mines. The metagenomic DNA from soil, root and shoot samples was isolated with the help of FastDNA spin kit. Through PCR, the 16S rRNA gene from four different Salsola plants and wheat plants was amplified and cloned in InsTAclone PCR cloning kit. Metagenomic analyses from rhizosphere, endosphere and phyllosphere of Salsola showed that approximately 29% bacteria were uncultured and unclassified. Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria were the most abundant phyla in Salsola and wheat. However, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Planctomycetes, Cyanobacteria, Thermotogae, Verrucomicrobia, Choroflexi and Euryarchaeota were predominant groups from halophyte whereas Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteriodetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia were predominant phyla of wheat samples. Diversity and differences of microbial flora of Salsola and wheat suggested that functional interactions between plants and microorganisms contribute to salt stress tolerance."

"28231452","abstracttext","Bread wheat is one of the major staple foods of worldwide population and iron plays a significant role in growth and development of the plant. In this report, we are presenting the genome wide identification of iron-binding proteins in bread wheat. The wheat genome derived putative proteome was screened for identification of iron-binding sequence motifs. Out of 602 putative iron-binding proteins, 130 were able to produce reliable structural models by homology techniques and further analyzed for the presence of iron-binding structural motifs. The computationally identified proteins appear to bind to ferrous and ferric ions and showed diverse coordination geometries. Glu, His, Asp and Cys amino acid residues were found to be mostly involved in iron binding. We have classified these proteins on the basis of their localization in the different cellular compartments. The identified proteins were further classified into their protein folds, families and functional classes ranging from structure maintenance of cellular components, regulation of gene expression, post translational modification, membrane proteins, enzymes, signaling and storage proteins. This comprehensive report regarding structural iron binding proteome provides useful insights into the diversity of iron binding proteins of wheat plants and further utilized to study their roles in plant growth, development and physiology."

"28159864","abstracttext","Soil-borne pathogens of the Pacific Northwest decrease yields in both spring and winter wheat. Pathogens of economic importance include Fusarium culmorum , Pratylenchus neglectus , P. thornei , and Rhizoctonia solani AG8. Few options are available to growers to manage these pathogens and reduce yield loss, therefore the focus for breeding programs is on developing resistant wheat cultivars. A recombinant inbred line population, LouAu (MP-7, NSL 511036), was developed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with resistance to P. neglectus and P. thornei This same population was later suspected to be resistant to F. culmorum and R. solani AG8. This study confirms partial resistance to F. culmorum and R. solani AG8 is present in this population. Six major and 16 speculative QTL were identified across seven measured traits. Four of the six major QTL were found within the same genomic region of the 5A wheat chromosome suggesting shared gene(s) contribute to the resistance. These QTL will be useful in breeding programs looking to incorporate resistance to soil-borne pathogens in wheat cultivars."

"28759728","abstracttext","Thinopyrum ponticum (Th. ponticum) (2n = 10x = 70) is an important breeding material with excellent resistance and stress tolerance. In this study, we characterized the derivative line CH1113-B13-1-1-2-1 (CH1113-B13) through cytological, morphological, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), expressed sequence tag (EST), and PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) marker analysis. The GISH analysis revealed that CH1113-B13 contained 20 pairs of common wheat chromosomes and one pair of J St genomic chromosomes. Linkage analysis of Th. ponticum using seven EST and seven PLUG markers indicated that the pair of alien chromosomes belonged to the seventh homeologous group. Nulli-tetrasomic and FISH analysis revealed that wheat 7B chromosomes were absent in CH1113-B13; thus, CH1113-B13 was identified as a 7J St (7B) substitution line. Finally, adult-stage CH1113-B13 exhibited immunity to wheat stripe rust. This substitution line is therefore a promising germplasm resource for wheat breeding."

Association analysis indicated thatTaAAP6-3B-I is significantly correlated with higher GPC than that of TaAAP6-3B-II for 115 wheat lines in all five environments. TaAAP6-3B-I, the favored allele of TaAAP6-3B, was preferentially expressed in preliminary developing grain stage. Two functional markers were developed to discriminate 197F 2 populations and the result showed that TaAAP6-3B-I (high-protein content) was completely dominant. Two cis-regulatory elements appear to be associated with high GPC were found in the 5'UTR of TaAAP6-3B-I.The change of the TaAAP6-3B locus types indicated that the gene was subjected to selection pressures during long process of artificial selection."

"28913796","abstracttext","Agriculture biotechnology is a promising tool for developing varieties with enhanced quality and quantity. Transgenic proteins expressed by genetically modified (GM) food crops improve crop characteristics like nutritional value, taste, and texture, and endow plants with resistance against fungus, pests, and insects. Despite such potential benefits, there are concerns regarding possible adverse effects of GM crops on human health, animals and the environment. Among the proposed guidelines for GM food safety testing-the weight-of-evidence approach proposed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission (ALINORM 03/34A) is the most recent. Till date, several transgenic wheat lines have been developed and research is underway for further improvement. However, GM wheat is not being grown or consumed in any part of the world. In the present study, in silico tools were employed for safety testing of eight transgenes used for the development of transgenic wheat lines. Among the genes studied, none of them shared sequence homology with the reported allergens and may be safe for use in genetic engineering. In conclusion, gene selection for developing transgenic wheat lines should be done with utmost care to ensure its safety for feed and fodder."

"29193733","abstracttext","Characterization of the function of stress-related genes helps to understand the mechanisms of plant responses to environmental conditions. The findings of this work defined the role of the wheat TaHDZipI-5 gene, encoding a stress-responsive homeodomain-leucine zipper class I (HD-Zip I) transcription factor, during the development of plant tolerance to frost and drought. Strong induction of TaHDZipI-5 expression by low temperatures, and the elevated TaHDZipI-5 levels of expression in flowers and early developing grains in the absence of stress, suggests that TaHDZipI-5 is involved in the regulation of frost tolerance at flowering. The TaHDZipI-5 protein behaved as an activator in a yeast transactivation assay, and the TaHDZipI-5 activation domain was localized to its C-terminus. The TaHDZipI-5 protein homo- and hetero-dimerizes with related TaHDZipI-3, and differences between DNA interactions in both dimers were specified at 3D molecular levels. The constitutive overexpression of TaHDZipI-5 in bread wheat significantly enhanced frost and drought tolerance of transgenic wheat lines with the appearance of undesired phenotypic features, which included a reduced plant size and biomass, delayed flowering and a grain yield decrease. An attempt to improve the phenotype of transgenic wheat by the application of stress-inducible promoters with contrasting properties did not lead to the elimination of undesired phenotype, apparently due to strict spatial requirements for TaHDZipI-5 overexpression."

"29291153","abstracttext","WRKY, a plant-specific transcription factor family, plays vital roles in pathogen defense, abiotic stress, and phytohormone signalling. Little is known about the roles and function of WRKY transcription factors in response to rust diseases in wheat. In the present study, three TaWRKY genes encoding complete protein sequences were cloned. They belonged to class II and III WRKY based on the number of WRKY domains and the pattern of zinc finger structures. Twenty-two DNA-protein binding docking complexes predicted stable interactions of WRKY domain with W-box. Quantitative real-time-PCR using wheat near-isogenic lines with or without Lr28 gene revealed differential up- or down-regulation in response to biotic and abiotic stress treatments which could be responsible for their functional divergence in wheat. TaWRKY62 was found to be induced upon treatment with JA, MJ, and SA and reduced after ABA treatments. Maximum induction of six out of seven genes occurred at 48 h post inoculation due to pathogen inoculation. Hence, TaWRKY (49, 50 , 52 , 55 , 57, and 62 ) can be considered as potential candidate genes for further functional validation as well as for crop improvement programs for stress resistance. The results of the present study will enhance knowledge towards understanding the molecular basis of mode of action of WRKY transcription factor genes in wheat and their role during leaf rust pathogenesis in particular."

The influence of strains Q2-8 and Q3-11 on water-soluble Cd and As and NH 4 + concentration and pH in the soil filtrate were also analyzed. Inoculation with these strains significantly reduced wheat plant Cd (12-32%) and As (9-29%) uptake and available Cd (15-28%) and As (22-38%) contents in rhizosphere soils compared to the controls. Furthermore, these strains significantly increased the relative abundances of the arsM bacterial As metabolism gene and of Fe- and Mn-oxidizing Leptothrix species in rhizosphere soils. Notably, these strains significantly reduced water-soluble Cd and As concentrations and increased pH and NH 4 + concentration in the soil filtrate. These results suggest that these strains increased soil pH and the abundance of genes possibly involved in metal(loid) unavailability, resulting in reduced wheat Cd and As accumulation and highlight the possibility of using bacteria for in situ remediation and safe production of wheat or other food crops in metal(loid)-polluted soils."

Together with the earlier identified AVRPM3 A2/F2 , the recognized AVRs of PM3B/C, (AVRPM3 B2/C2 ), and PM3D (AVRPM3 D3 ) belong to a large group of proteins with low sequence homology but predicted structural similarities. AvrPm3 b2/c2 and AvrPm3 d3 are conserved in all tested isolates of wheat and rye mildew, and non-host infection assays demonstrate that Pm3b, Pm3c, and Pm3d are also restricting the growth of rye mildew on wheat. Furthermore, divergent AVR homologues from non-adapted rye and Dactylis mildews are recognized by PM3B, PM3C, or PM3D, demonstrating their involvement in host specificity."

"32622997","abstracttext","The hexaploid species Echinochloa crus-galli is one of the most detrimental weeds in crop fields, especially in rice paddies. Its evolutionary history is similar to that of bread wheat, arising through polyploidization after hybridization between a tetraploid and a diploid species. In this study, we generated and analyzed high-quality genome sequences of diploid (E. haploclada), tetraploid (E. oryzicola), and hexaploid (E. crus-galli) Echinochloa species. Gene family analysis showed a significant loss of disease-resistance genes such as those encoding NB-ARC domain-containing proteins during Echinochloa polyploidization, contrary to their significant expansionduring wheat polyploidization, suggesting that natural selection might favor reduced investment in resistance in this weed to maximize its growth and reproduction. In contrast to the asymmetric patterns of genome evolution observed in wheat and other crops, no significant differences in selection pressure were detected between the subgenomes in E. oryzicola and E. crus-galli. In addition, distinctive differences in subgenome transcriptome dynamics during hexaploidization were observed between E. crus-galli and bread wheat. Collectively, our study documents genomic mechanisms underlying the adaptation of a major agricultural weed during polyploidization. The genomic and transcriptomic resources of three Echinochloa species and new insights into the polyploidization-driven adaptive evolution would be useful for future breeding cereal crops."

Host resistance is well known to be the most efficient method to control this disease. However, the molecular mechanism of wheat powdery mildew resistance ( Pm ) is still unclear. To analyze the molecular mechanism of Pm , we used the resistant wheat cultivar Jimai 23 to investigate its potential resistance components and profiled its expression in response to powdery mildew infection using bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq). We showed that the Pm of Jimai 23 was provided by a single dominant gene, tentatively designated PmJM23 , and assigned it to the documented Pm2 region of chromosome 5DS. 3,816 consistently different SNPs were called between resistant and susceptible parents and the bulked pools derived from the combinations between the resistant parent Jimai23 and the susceptible parent Tainong18. 58 of the SNPs were assigned to the candidate region of PmJM23 . Subsequently, 3,803 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between parents and bulks were analyzed by GO, COG and KEGG pathway enrichment. The temporal expression patterns of associated genes following Bgt inoculation were further determined by RT-qPCR.

"32440671","abstracttext","There is little understanding about how soil water stress history and host genotype influence the response of wheat-associated microbiome under short-term decreases in soil moisture. To address this, we investigated how plant breeding history (four wheat genotypes; two with recognized drought resistance and two without) and soil water stress history (same wheat field soil from Saskatchewan with contrasting long-term irrigation) independently or interactively influenced the response of the rhizosphere, root and leaf bacterial and fungal microbiota to short-term decreases in soil water content (SWC). We used amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA gene for bacteria and ITS region for fungi) to characterize the wheat microbiome. Fungal and bacterial communities responses to short-term decreases in SWC were mainly constrained by soil water stress history, with some smaller, but significant influence of plant genotype. One exception was the leaf-associated fungal communities, for which the largest constraint was genotype, resulting in a clear differentiation of the communities based on the genotype's sensitivity to water stress. Our results clearly indicate that soil legacy does not only affect the response to water stress of the microbes inhabiting the soil, but also of the microorganisms more closely associated with the plant tissues, and even of the plant itself."

Wheat Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease in wheat and barley worldwide. Growing FHB-resistant cultivars is an effective strategy to minimize FHB damage in wheat production. Fhb1 is a quantitative trait locus for FHB resistance with the largest effect on disease severity identified to date. With this study, we developed diagnostic DNA markers for Fhb1 by comparing the genomic sequences in Fhb1 region between near-isogenic lines contrasting in Fhb1 alleles and phenotypic effects of the markers. Two markers were developed based on a deletion mutation in an gene encoding a putative histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (TaHRC) and validated in different types of populations. Haplotype or sequence analyses of the two markers in the three sets of diversity panels demonstrated that they are diagnostic for Fhb1, and superior to all previously used markers in selection accuracy. They also have the advantages of low cost, easy assay, and are suitable for breeding programs with either high- or low-throughput marker laboratories."

"30103374","abstracttext","ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters hydrolyze ATP to transport a wide range of substrates. Fusarium graminearum is a major causal agent of Fusarium head blight, which is a severe disease in wheat worldwide. FgABCC9 ( FG05_07325 ) encodes an ABC-C (ABC transporter family C) transporter in F. graminearum , which was highly expressed during the infection in wheat and was up-regulated by the plant defense hormone salicylic acid (SA) and the fungicide tebuconazole. The predicted tertiary structure of the FgABCC9 protein was consistent with the schematic of the ABC exporter. Deletion of FgABCC9 resulted in decreased mycelial growth, increased sensitivity to SA and tebuconazole, reduced accumulation of deoxynivalenol (DON), and less pathogenicity towards wheat. Re-introduction of a functional FgABCC9 gene into Δ FgABCC9 recovered the phenotypes of the wild type strain. Transgenic expression of FgABCC9 in Arabidopsis thaliana increased the accumulation of SA in its leaves without activating SA signaling, which suggests that FgABCC9 functions as an SA exporter. Taken together, FgABCC9 encodes an ABC exporter, which is critical for fungal exportation of SA, response to tebuconazole, mycelial growth, and pathogenicity towards wheat."

"30083172","abstracttext","As the key producers of reactive oxygen species (ROS), NADPH oxidases (NOXs), also known as respiratory burst oxidase homologs (RBOHs), play crucial roles in various biological processes in plants with considerable evolutionary selection and functional diversity in the entire terrestrial plant kingdom. However, only limited resources are available on the phylogenesis and functions of this gene family in wheat. Here, a total of 46 NOX family genes were identified in the wheat genome, and these NOXs could be classified into three subgroups: typical TaNOXs, TaNOX-likes, and ferric reduction oxidases (TaFROs). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the typical TaNOXs might originate from TaFROs during evolution, and the TaFROs located on Chr 2 might be the most ancient forms of TaNOXs. TaNOXs are highly expressed in wheat with distinct tissue or organ-specificity and stress-inducible diversity. A large-scale expression and/or coexpression analysis demonstrated that TaNOXs can be divided into four functional groups with different expression patterns under a broad range of environmental stresses. Different TaNOXs are coexpressed with different sets of other genes, which widely participate in several important intracellular processes such as cell wall biosynthesis, defence response, and signal transduction, suggesting their vital but diversity of roles in plant growth regulation and stress responses of wheat."

Compared with its wild-type parent, YZ4110, m605 was at least 7 days late in heading when sown in autumn. This late heading trait was controlled by a single recessive gene named TaHdm605 . Genetic mapping located the TaHdm605 locus between the molecular markers cfd152 and barc42 on chromosome 3DL using publicly available markers and then further mapped this locus to a 1.86 Mb physical genomic region containing 26 predicted genes. This fine genetic and physical mapping will be helpful for the future map-based cloning of TaHdm605 and for breeders seeking to engineer changes in the wheat heading date trait."

The results indicated that total phenolic content (TPC) of the 4-day germinated wheat under UV-B radiation with CaCl 2 (UV-B+Ca) treatment significantly increased by 10.3% as compared to the UV-B treatment. Gene expression levels of p-coumarate 3-hydroxylase, cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase and caffeic acid O-methyltransferase were positively correlated with the content of ferulic and p-coumaric acids, respectively. Exogenous Ca 2+ could significantly alleviate the membrane lipid peroxidation, activate the antioxidant enzymes and regulate the phytohormone level under UV-B radiation.

"30295847","abstracttext","FLOWERING LOCUS T2 (FT2) is the closest paralog of the FT1 flowering gene in the temperate grasses. Here we show that overexpression of FT2 in Brachypodium distachyon and barley results in precocious flowering and reduced spikelet number, while down-regulation by RNA interference results in delayed flowering and a reduced percentage of filled florets. Similarly, truncation mutations of FT2 homeologs in tetraploid wheat delayed flowering (2-4 d) and reduced fertility. The wheat ft2 mutants also showed a significant increase in the number of spikelets per spike, with a longer spike development period potentially contributing to the delayed heading time. In the wheat leaves, FT2 was expressed later than FT1, suggesting a relatively smaller role for FT2 in the initiation of the reproductive phase. FT2 transcripts were detected in the shoot apical meristem and increased during early spike development. Transversal sections of the developing spike showed the highest FT2 transcript levels in the distal part, where new spikelets are formed. Our results suggest that, in wheat, FT2 plays an important role in spike development and fertility and a limited role in the timing of the transition between the vegetative and reproductive shoot apical meristem."

"30708731","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, one of devastating diseases of wheat worldwide, is caused by Erysiphe graminis f. sp. tritici, a fungal species with constant population changes, which often poses challenges in disease management with host resistance. Transgenic approaches that utilize broad-spectrum resistance may limit changes of pathogen populations and contribute to effective control of the disease. The harpin protein Hpa1, produced by the rice bacterial blight pathogen, can induce resistance to bacterial blight and blast in rice. The fragment comprising residues 10 through 42 of Hpa1, Hpa1 10-42 , is reportedly three- to eightfold more effective than the full-length protein. This study evaluated the transgenic expression of the Hpa1 10-42 gene for resistance to powdery mildew in wheat caused by E. graminis f. sp. tritici. Nine Hpa1 10-42 transgenic wheat lines were generated. The genomic integration of Hpa1 10-42 was confirmed, and expression of the transgene was detected at different levels in the individual transgenic lines. Following inoculation with the E. graminis f. sp. tritici isolate Egt15 in the greenhouse, five transgenic lines had significantly higher levels of resistance to powdery mildew compared with nontransformed plants. Thus, transgenic expression of Hpa1 10-42 conferred resistance to one isolate of E. graminis f. sp. tritici in wheat in the greenhouse."

This study evaluated the effect of selenate application on Se biofortification, macro- and micronutrient content, and the expression of genes involved in Se uptake and assimilation in 12 Brazilian wheat ( L.) cultivars. This nutrient-solution experiment was performed in a greenhouse and consisted of a complete 12 × 2 factorial randomized design, with 12 wheat cultivars in the absence or presence of Se in solution (13 μmol), with three replicates. The presence of Se in solution did not affect growth and yield of wheat cultivars. Selenium content and accumulation in the grain varied significantly among the different cultivars. The presence of Se affected macronutrient content more than micronutrient content, and selenate application increased S content in the shoots of eight cultivars and in the grains of five cultivars. Examination of gene expression did not allow identification of responses within the two groups of cultivars-with high or low Se contents-after selenate application.

"30441835","abstracttext","Wheat, the main source of carbohydrates worldwide, can be attacked by a wide number of phytopathogenic fungi, included Alternaria species. Alternaria species commonly occur on wheat worldwide and produce several mycotoxins such as tenuazonic acid (TA), alternariol (AOH), alternariol-monomethyl ether (AME), and altenuene (ALT), provided of haemato-toxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic activities. The contamination by Alternaria species of wheat kernels, collected in Tuscany, Italy, from 2013 to 2016, was evaluated. Alternaria contamination was detected in 93 out of 100 field samples, with values ranging between 1 and 73% (mean of 18%). Selected strains were genetically characterized by multi-locus gene sequencing approach through combined sequences of allergen alt1a, glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and translation elongation factor 1α genes. Two well defined groups were generated; namely sections Alternaria and Infectoriae . Representative strains were analyzed for mycotoxin production. A different mycotoxin profile between the sections was shown. Of the 54 strains analyzed for mycotoxins, all strains included in Section Alternaria produced AOH and AME, 40 strains (99%) produced TA, and 26 strains (63%) produced ALT. On the other hand, only a very low capability to produce both AOH and AME was recorded among the Section Infectoriae strains. These data show that a potential mycotoxin risk related to the consumption of Alternaria contaminated wheat is high."

"30353669","abstracttext_results","Compared to the control, biocahr amendments decreased aphid lifetime fertility by 9.09% and 20.23% for amending levels at 3% and 5%, respectively; it reduced aphid population by 18.68%, 21.69%, and 28.70% for the levels at 1.5%, 3%, and 5%, respectively. Biochar applications increased silicon content more than 40% in wheat plants. Furthermore, biochar additions increased the expression of four defense-related genes (AOS, LOX, PAL and PR) in wheat plants with extension of feeding time by aphids."

"30706082","abstracttext_key message","Novel rust resistance genes LrP and YrP from Ae. peregrina identified on chromosome 5D and the linked markers will aid deployment of these genes in combination with other major/minor genes. Aegilops peregrina, a wild tetraploid relative of wheat with genome constitution UUSS, displays genetic variation for resistance to leaf and stripe (yellow) rust. The wheat Ae. peregrina introgression line, IL pau16058, harbouring leaf and stripe rust resistance, was crossed with wheat cv. WL711 to generate an F 2:3 mapping population. Inheritance studies on this population indicated the transfer of dominant co-segregating resistance to leaf and stripe rust. Ethyl methane sulphonate mutagenesis of IL pau16058 identified independent loss-of-function mutants for leaf and stripe rust resistance, indicating that the leaf and stripe rust resistance is controlled by independent genes, herein designated LrP and YrP, respectively. A high-resolution genetic map of LrP and YrP was constructed using the Illumina Infinium iSelect 90K wheat array and resistance gene enrichment sequencing (RenSeq) markers. The map spans 4.19 cM on the distal-most region of the short arm of chromosome 5D, consisting of eight SNP markers and one microsatellite marker. LrP and YrP co-segregated with markers BS00163889 and 5DS44573_snp and was flanked distally by the SNP marker BS00129707 and proximally by 5DS149010, defining a 15.71 Mb region in the RefSeq v1.0 genome assembly."
"31664150","articletitle","Yeast two-hybrid screening for proteins that interact with PFT in wheat."
"31664150","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. Fhb1 is the most consistently reported quantitative trait locus (QTL) for FHB resistance breeding. A pore-forming toxin-like (PFT) gene at Fhb1 was first cloned by map-based cloning and found to confer FHB resistance in wheat. Proteins often interact with each other to execute their functions. Characterization of the proteins interacting with PFT might therefore provide information on the molecular mechanisms of PFT functions. In this study, a high-quality yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) library using RNA extracted from Fusarium graminearum (Fg)-infected wheat spikes of Sumai 3 was constructed. The agglutinin domains of PFT exhibited no self-activation and toxicity to yeast cells and were used as bait to screen the Y2H library. Twenty-three proteins that interact with PFT were obtained, which were mainly involved in the ubiquitination process, clathrin coat assembly, the oxidation-reduction process, and protein phosphorylation. The expression pattern of these interacting genes was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. This study clarifies the protein interactions of PFT and raises a regulatory network for PFT regarding FHB resistance in wheat."

"31968554","abstracttext","Our previous study indicated that glycerol application induced resistance to powdery mildew ( Bgt ) in wheat by regulating two important signal molecules, glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) and oleic acid (OA18:1). Transcriptome analysis of wheat leaves treated by glycerol and inoculated with Bgt was performed to identify the activated immune response pathways. We identified a set of differentially expressed transcripts (e.g., TaGLI1 , TaACT1 , and TaSSI2 ) involved in glycerol and fatty acid metabolism that were upregulated in response to Bgt infection and might contribute to G3P and OA18:1 accumulation. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis revealed GO terms induced by glycerol, such as response to jasmonic acid (JA), defense response to bacterium, lipid oxidation, and growth. In addition, glycerol application induced genes (e.g., LOX , AOS , and OPRs ) involved in the metabolism pathway of linolenic and alpha-linolenic acid, which are precursor molecules of JA biosynthesis. Glycerol induced JA and salicylic acid (SA) levels, while glycerol reduced the auxin (IAA) level in wheat. Glycerol treatment also induced pathogenesis related ( PR ) genes, including PR-1 , PR-3 , PR-10 , callose synthase , PRMS , RPM1 , peroxidase , HSP70 , HSP90 , etc. These results indicate that glycerol treatment regulates fatty acid metabolism and hormones cross-talk and induces the expression of PR genes that together contribute to Bgt resistance in wheat."

"32048094","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA) response element (ABRE)-binding factors (ABFs) are basic region/leucine zipper motif (bZIP) transcription factors that regulate the expression of ABA-induced genes containing ABRE in their promoters. The amino acid sequence of the wheat bZIP protein, TaABI5, showed high homology to that of Arabidopsis ABA insensitive 5 (ABI5). TaABI5 was classified into the clade of ABI5s in Arabidopsis and rice, unlike TRAB1 of rice, Wabi5 of wheat, and HvABI5 of barley in the bZIP Group A family, by a phylogenetic analysis. TaABI5 was strongly expressed in seeds during the late ripening and maturing stages; however, its expression level markedly decreased after germination. An in situ hybridization analysis showed that TaABI5 mRNA accumulated in seed embryos, particularly the scutellum. In a transient assay using wheat aleurone cells, TaABI5 activated the promoter of Em containing ABRE, which is an embryogenesis abundant protein gene, indicating that TaABI5 acts as a transcription factor in wheat seeds. Furthermore, the seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis lines introduced with 35S:TaABI5 exhibited high sensitivity to ABA and the inhibition of germination. The seed dormancy of the transgenic Arabidopsis lines was stronger than that of Col. These results support TaABI5 playing an important role in mature seeds, particularly before seed germination, and acting as a functional ortholog to Arabidopsis ABI5."
"31878210","articletitle","Overexpression of ThMYC4E Enhances Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Common Wheat."
"31878210","abstracttext","The basic helix-loop helix (bHLH) transcription factor has been inferred to play an important role in blue and purple grain traits in common wheat, but to date, its overexpression has not been reported. In this study, the bHLH transcription factor ThMYC4E , the candidate gene controlling the blue grain trait from Th. Ponticum , was transferred to the common wheat JW1. The positive transgenic lines displayed higher levels of purple anthocyanin pigments in their grains, leaves and glumes. Stripping the glumes (light treatment) caused white grains to become purple in transgenic lines. RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the transcript levels of structural genes associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis were higher in transgenic wheat than the wild-type (WT), which indicated that ThMYC4E activated anthocyanin biosynthesis in the transgenic lines. Correspondingly, the anthocyanin contents in grains, roots, stems, leaves and glumes of transgenic lines were higher than those in the WT. Metabolome analysis demonstrated that the anthocyanins were composed of cyanidin and delphinidin in the grains of the transgenic lines. Moreover, the transgenic lines showed higher antioxidant activity, in terms of scavenging DPPH radicals, in the ethanol extracts of their grains. The overexpression of ThMYC4E sheds light on the traits related to anthocyanin biosynthesis in common wheat and provide a new way to improve anthocyanin content."
"31290927","articletitle","Genome-Wide Identification and Characterization of the Wheat Remorin ( Ta REM) Family during Cold Acclimation."
"31290927","abstracttext","Remorins (REMs) are plant-specific proteins that play an essential role in plant-microbe interactions. However, their roles in vernalization and abiotic stress responses remain speculative. Most remorins have a variable proline-rich -half and a more conserved -half that is predicted to form coils. A search of the wheat ( L.) database revealed the existence of 20 different genes, which we classified into six groups on the basis of whether they shared a common phylogenetic and structural origin. Analysis of the physical genomic distributions demonstrated that genes are dispersed in the wheat genome and have one to seven introns. Promoter analysis of genes revealed the presence of putative -elements related to diverse functions like development, hormonal regulation, and biotic and abiotic stress responsiveness. Expression levels of genes were measured in plants grown under field and controlled conditions and in response to hormone treatment. Our analyses revealed that 12 members of the REM family are regulated during cold acclimation in wheat in four different tissues (roots, crowns, stems, and leaves), with the highest expression in roots. Differential gene expression was found between wheat cultivars with contrasting degrees of cold tolerance, suggesting the implication of genes in cold response and tolerance. Additionally, eight genes were induced in response to abscisic acid and methyl jasmonate treatment. This genome-wide analysis of genes provides valuable resources for functional analysis aimed at understanding their role in stress adaptation."

"31606466","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), a biotrophic plant pathogen, secretes numerous effectors to modulate host defense systems. Understanding the molecular mechanisms by which Pst effectors regulate wheat immunity is of great importance for the development of novel strategies for durable control of stripe rust. In this study, we identified a glycine-serine-rich effector gene, PstGSRE1, which is highly induced during early infection. Transgenic expression of PstGSRE1 RNAi constructs in wheat significantly reduced virulence of Pst and increased H 2 O 2 accumulation in wheat. PstGSRE1 was shown to target the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated transcription factor TaLOL2, a positive regulator of wheat immunity. PstGSRE1 disrupted nuclear localization of TaLOL2 and suppressed ROS-mediated cell death induced by TaLOL2, thus compromising host immunity. This work reveals a previously unrecognized strategy whereby rust fungi exploit the PstGSRE1 effector to defeat ROS-associated plant defense by modulating the subcellular compartment of a host immune regulator and facilitate pathogen infection."

"31623257","abstracttext","Wheat germ is rich in quinones that exist as glycosides. In this study, we used Celluclast 1.5L to release the hydroxyquinones, which turn into benzoquinone, and prepared the water extract from enzyme-treated wheat germ (EWG). We investigated whether enzyme treatment altered the anti-inflammatory activity compared to the water extract of untreated wheat germ (UWG). UWG inhibited the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and interleukin (IL)-12 and induced the production of IL-10 and heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated macrophages. Enzyme treatment resulted in greater inhibition of iNOS and IL-10 and induction of HO-1 compared to UWG, possibly involving the modulation of nuclear factor (NF)-κB, activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor (Nrf2). Mice fed UWG or EWG had decreased serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and increased serum IL-10 levels after intraperitoneal injection of LPS, with UWG being more effective for IL-10 and EWG more effective for TNF-α. Hepatic HO-1 gene was only expressed in mice fed EWG. We provide evidence that enzyme treatment is a useful biotechnology tool for extracting active compounds from wheat germ."

"31624874","abstracttext_key message","An original RNA-seq mapping strategy, validated with chromosome engineering and physical mapping, identifies candidate genes for fertility restoration in the 6H ch S chromosome of Hordeum chilense in the wheat msH1 system. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is a valuable trait for hybrid seed production. The msH1 CMS system in common wheat results from the incompatibility between the nuclear genome of wheat and the cytoplasm of the wild barley Hordeum chilense. This work aims to identify H. chilense candidate genes for fertility restoration in the msH1 system with a multidisciplinary strategy based on chromosome engineering, differential expression analysis and genome mapping. Alloplasmic isogenic wheat lines differing for fertility, associated with the presence of an acrocentric chromosome H ch ac resulting from the rearrangement of the short arms of H. chilense chromosomes 1H ch and 6H ch , were used for transcriptome sequencing. Two novel RNA-seq mapping approaches were designed and compared to identify differentially expressed genes of H. chilense associated with male fertility restoration. Minichromosomes (H ch mi), new smaller reorganizations of the H ch ac also restoring fertility, were obtained and used to validate the candidate genes. This strategy was successful identifying a putative restorer-of-fertility region on 6H ch S, with six candidate genes, including the ortholog of the barley restorer gene Rfm1. Additionally, transcriptomics gave preliminary insights on sterility and restoration networks showing the importance of energy supply, stress, protein metabolism and RNA processing."

"31571297","abstracttext","Dissection of the genetic basis of wheat ionome is crucial for understanding the physiological and biochemical processes underlying mineral accumulation in seeds, as well as for efficient crop breeding. Most of the elements essential for plants are metals stored in seeds as chelate complexes with phytic acid or sulfur-containing compounds. We assume that the involvement of phosphorus and sulfur in metal chelation is the reason for strong phenotypic correlations within ionome. Adjustment of element concentrations for the effect of variation in phosphorus and sulfur seed content resulted in drastic change of phenotypic correlations between the elements. The genetic architecture of wheat grain ionome was characterized by quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using a cross between durum and wild emmer wheat. QTL analysis of the adjusted traits and two-trait analysis of the initial traits paired with either P or S considerably improved QTL detection power and accuracy, resulting in the identification of 105 QTLs and 617 QTL effects for 11 elements. Candidate gene search revealed some potential functional associations between QTLs and corresponding genes within their intervals. Thus, we have shown that accounting for variation in P and S is crucial for understanding of the physiological and genetic regulation of mineral composition of wheat grain ionome and can be implemented for other plants."
"33277705","articletitle","PR1-mediated defence via C-terminal peptide release is targeted by a fungal pathogen effector."
"33277705","abstracttext","The effector SnTox3 from Parastagonospora nodorum elicits a strong necrotic response in susceptible wheat and also interacts with wheat pathogenesis-related protein 1 (TaPR-1), although the function of this interaction in disease is unclear. Here, we dissect TaPR1 function by studying SnTox3-TaPR1 interaction and demonstrate the dual functionality of SnTox3. We utilised site-directed mutagenesis to identify a SnTox3 variant, SnTox3 P173S , that was unable to interact with TaPR1 in yeast-two-hybrid assays. Additionally, using recombinant proteins we established a novel protein-mediated phenotyping assay allowing functional studies to be undertaken in wheat. Wheat leaves infiltrated with TaPR1 proteins showed significantly less disease compared to control leaves, correlating with a strong increase in defence gene expression. This activity was dependent on release of the TaCAPE1 peptide embedded within TaPR1 by an unidentified serine protease. The priming activity of TaPR1 was compromised by SnTox3 but not the non-interacting variant SnTox3 P173S , and we demonstrate that SnTox3 prevents TaCAPE1 release from TaPR1 in vitro. SnTox3 independently functions to induce necrosis through recognition by Snn3 and also suppress host defence through a direct interaction with TaPR1 proteins. Importantly, this study also advances our understanding of the role of PR1 proteins in host-microbe interactions as inducers of host defence signalling."

"19076692","abstracttext","The objectives of this study were to clarify the relationship between LMW-GS Glu-D3 gene of Ae. tauschii registered in GenBank and the six Glu-D3 genes including 12 allelic variants of common wheat characterized in our previous studies, and identify novel Glu-D3 genes and haplotypes from Ae. tauschii using gene specific PCR amplification. By searching the NCBI database, 13 LMW-GS genes/pseudogenes of Ae. tauschii were retrieved and classified into five gene families based on their nucleotide similarity with the six Glu-D3 genes of common wheat. Of them, four Ae. tauschii genes, AY585350, AY585354, AY585355 and AY585356 matched GluD3-4, GluD3-5, GluD3-1 and GluD3-2 of common wheat, respectively, and one pseudogene AY585351 matched to GluD3-6, but none of them matched to GluD3-3. In order to identify the Glu-D3 genes from Ae. tauschii corresponding to GluD3-3 and GluD3-6 of common wheat, gene specific primers were developed to amplify 8-18 Ae. tauschii entries. As a result, two novel Glu-D3 genes, designated as GluDt3-3 and GluDt3-6, were identified. GluDt3-3 showed seven allelic variants or haplotypes at the DNA level in eight Ae. tauschii entries, designated as GluDt3-31, GluDt3-32, GluDt3-33, GluDt3-34, GluDt3-35, GluDt3-36 and GluDt3-37, respectively. Two to eight SNPs were found among the seven haplotypes and 1-4 amino acid substitutions among the deduced peptides. Multiple sequence alignments showed that the DNA similarity was 99.6-99.9% among the seven GluDt3-3 haplotypes, and 99.4-99.7% between these haplotypes and those of common wheat GluD3-3 gene. GluDt3-6 presented seven haplotypes in 18 Ae. tauschii entries, designated as GluDt3-61, GluDt3-62, GluDt3-63, GluDt3-64, GluDt3-65, GluDt3-66 and GluDt3-67, respectively. GluDt3-61 from Ae. tauschii entry Ae38 was the only one haplotype with complete coding sequence, and the other six were all pseudogenes. Compared with GluD3-6 gene of common wheat, GluDt3-61 exhibited a 3-bp insertion, a 42-bp deletion and 11 base substitutions, leading to a glutamine insertion in position 52, 14 amino acid deletion in position 84-97 and 10 amino acid mutations in its deduced peptide; GluDt3-62 and GluDt3-63 showed a 6-bp insertion, a 24-bp deletion and 15-21 base substitutions in coding region, of which a nonsense mutation from C to T at position 622 resulted in pseudogenes; GluDt3-64 had five base substitution, including a nonsense mutation at the position 742. GluDt3-65, GluDt3-66 and GluDt3-67 all had a base deletion at position 247, as well as 7-8 base substitutions, which resulted in frameshift mutations in the three haplotypes. The results indicated that Ae. tauschii also contains six Glu-D3 genes and their allelic variants are even richer than those in common wheat."

"30786500","abstracttext","A new Phaeosphaeria sp. biotype was isolated from winter ryes in Poland during 1995. Two isolates, Sn23-1 and Sn48-1, were obtained from diseased leaves of cvs. Motto and Dańkowskie, respectively. The rye Phaeosphaeria sp. represented by isolate Sn48-1 has similar pycnidiospore morphology and induces disease symptoms in cereals similar to Phaeosphaeria nodorum, the causal agent of Stagonospora nodorum blotch disease (4). The pathogen (Sn48-1) produces hyaline, cylindrical pycnidiospores that are mostly three-septate and measure 12.8 to 23.7 × 2.1 to 3.2 μm (average size = 16 × 2.6 μm) on water agar. A molecular comparison of several genes in isolates Sn23-1 and Sn48-1 revealed that the rye Phaeosphaeria sp. was different from P. nodorum. In the conserved alpha-box sequence (1,93 bp) of the MAT1-1 gene, a four nucleotide difference occurred between the wheat-biotype P. nodorum and isolates Sn23-1 and Sn48-1 (GenBank Accession Nos. AY072933 and AF322008). In addition, the length of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the nuclear rDNA was the same for the wheat-biotype P. nodorum and the two rye Phaeosphaeria sp. isolates. However, a six nucleotide discrepancy was found in the ITS region (GenBank Accession Nos. U77362 and AF321323). The beta-glucosidase (bgl1) and beta-tubulin (tubA) genes differ in length between the wheat-biotype P. nodorum and two rye Phaeosphaeria sp. isolates (2,3). The main difference was due to the intron sizes of these two genes. One extra nucleotide was found in the intron2 of the bgl1 gene (GenBank Accession Nos. AY683619 and AY683620) and the intron1 of the tubA gene (GenBank Accession Nos. AY786337 and AY786331), respectively, in these two rye Phaeosphaeria sp. isolates. Disease severity on the fifth leaf (GS15) of Polish wheat (Alba, Begra, and Liwilla), triticale (Bogo and Pinokio), and rye (Zduno) cultivars was assessed with one (resistant) to nine (susceptible) scales 14 days after inoculation. Aggressiveness of wheat-biotype P. nodorum isolate Sn26-1 and rye Phaeosphaeria sp. isolate Sn48-1 was significant (P < 0.01) in five cultivars except in the moderately resistant wheat cv. Liwilla. The rye Phaeosphaeria sp. isolate Sn48-1 severely affected Polish rye Zduno (8.3) and two triticale cultivars (6.5), while the infection by isolate Sn26-1 was moderate (3-4). On the contrary, the wheat-biotype P. nodorum isolate Sn26-1 was more aggressive on wheat (4.1 on moderately resistant Alba and 6.2 on highly susceptible Begra) than the rye Phaeosphaeria sp. isolate Sn48-1, which had a scale of 2.2 and 4.3, respectively. Under laboratory conditions, the rye isolate Sn48-1 was able to cross with the wheat-biotype P. nodorum isolate Sn26-1 that has an opposite mating-type (MAT1-2) gene, but few viable ascospores were produced (1).

The genes contained six exons and five introns, and the sequences of exons were more conserved compared with those of introns. The Psy1-A1 genes encoded a polypeptide of 428 aminoacid residues, with one residue longer than those encoded by Psy1-D1 genes. The Psy1-B1/Psy1-S1 genes encoded four types of polypeptides, with 421 (Psy1-B1h through Psy1-B1j, Psy1-B1l), 427 (Psy1-B1k, Psy1-S1a and Psy1-S1c), 428 (Psy1-B1m), and 429 (Psy1-S1b) aminoacid residues, respectively. Neighbor joining tree was generated based on the gene sequences of the 27 novel alleles and those of the 13 alleles reported previously in common wheat and its relatives. The phylogenetic tree consisted of two subtrees. The subtree I comprised 11 of 14 alleles at Psy1-A1 locus, nine of 16 alleles at Psy1-B1/Psy1-S1 locus, and ten novel alleles at Psy1-D1 locus, while the subtree II included the other three alleles at Psy1-A1 locus, the remaining four Psy1-B1 alleles and three Psy1-S1 alleles. The alleles from different clusters showed high sequence divergences, indicated by various SNPs and InDels (insertion/deletion). The phylogenetic relationships of these allelic variants at the three loci in common wheat and its relatives also supported the hypothesis that common wheat was originated by recurrent hexaploidization events. In addition, 193 Chinese wheat cultivars with different yellow pigment contents were genotyped with two novel STS markers YP7D-1 and YP7D-2. The results indicated that 191 cultivars contained the allele Psy1-D1a, and two had Psy1-D1g."

"3897835","abstracttext","A genomic clone for a major chlorophyll a/b-binding polypeptide of the light-harvesting complex has been sequenced from wheat. This gene, whAB1.6, encodes a 70-nucleotide 5'-nontranslated spacer, a 34-amino-acid NH2-terminal extension, i.e., the transit peptide, and a mature coding protein of 232 amino acid residues. The exact molecular weight of the precursor polypeptide is 28,560. The transit peptide is basic and is rich in serines. No intervening sequences are found in this gene. The transcription start site of the whAB1.6 gene occurs at AAAC as determined by S1 nuclease analysis. Putative regulatory sequences occur upstream of the gene at -25 (TTTAAATA) and at -72 (CCAACCA). Northern blots show a single RNA species estimated to be 1,100 nucleotides. Heterogeneity of the RNA population is demonstrated in S1 nuclease analyses with a 5'-end-labeled fragment that extends 191 nucleotides into the mature protein coding sequence. At least seven different transcripts can be recognized. The highest levels of RNA transcribed from the whAB1.6 gene are found in the basal segments of the wheat leaf, whereas other chlorophyll a/b-binding transcripts in the cell show a different pattern of abundance. As a control, we show that roots do not contain chlorophyll a/b-binding RNA. The most abundant RNA species shows an interrupted homology with the whAB1.6 gene at the start of the mature protein coding sequence; another species shows homology beginning at the start of the transit peptide and does not include the nontranslated region. Chlorophyll a/b-binding polypeptides accumulate toward the tip of the leaf as shown by Western blot analysis of total thylakoid proteins."

To elucidate the genetics of resistance in this line, we evaluated the Q21861/SM89010 (Q/SM) doubled-haploid population for reaction to race TTKSK at the seedling stage. Segregation for resistance:susceptibility in Q/SM doubled-haploid lines fit a 1:1 ratio (58:71 with chi2=1.31 and P=0.25), indicating that a single gene in Q21861 confers resistance to race TTKSK. In previous studies, a recessive gene (rpg4) and a partially dominant gene (Rpg5) were reported to control resistance to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race QCCJ and P. graminis f. sp. secalis isolate 92-MN-90, respectively, in Q21861. These resistance genes co-segregate with each other in the Q/SM population and were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 5H. Resistance to race TTKSK also co-segregated with resistance to both rusts, indicating that the gene conferring resistance to race TTKSK also lies at the rpg4/Rpg5 locus. This result was confirmed through the molecular analysis of recombinants previously used to characterize loci conferring resistance to race QCCJ and isolate 92-MN-90. The 70-kb region contains Rpg5 (a nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat serine/threonine-protein kinase gene), rpg4 (an actin depolymerizing factor-like gene), and two other genes of unidentified function. Research is underway to resolve which of the genes are required for conferring resistance to race TTKSK. Regardless, the simple inheritance should make Q21861 a valuable source of TTKSK resistance in barley breeding programs."

"23443578","abstracttext","Wall-associated receptor-like kinases (WAKs) are important candidates for directly linking the extracellular matrix with intracellular compartments and are involved in developmental processes and stress response. WAK gene family has been identified in plants such as Arabidopsis and rice. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the WAK1 gene from barley cv. Golden Promise, mapped to chromosome 5H. Three BAC clones corresponding to the WAK fragment were sequenced and the full-length WAK1 gene was characterized. The gene has three exons and two short introns with a coding region of 2,178 bp encoding a protein of 725 amino acids. A regulatory region was analyzed in -1,000 bp sequence upstream to start codon. Using conserved domains database and SMART, various conserved domains such as GUB WAK Bind, epidermal growth factor CA, and protein kinase C as well as other regions like signal peptides, active sites, and transmembrane domains were identified. The gene organization of HvWAK1 was compared with wheat (TaWAK1) and Arabidopsis (AtWAK1), suggesting that the WAK1 gene organization has remained highly conserved. Nonetheless, WAK1 was found to be highly divergent when compared with sequences available from barley cv. Haruna Nijo (50 %), rice (46 %), wheat (21 %), Arabidopsis (25 %), and maize (19 %). This divergence may have facilitated a better adaptation to surrounding environments due to its role in communication between the extracellular matrix, cell, and outer environment. Semiquantitative RT-PCR-based expression analysis indicates HvWAK1 expression is specific to roots. Significant differences in root growth between GP wild type and GP-Ds mutant seedlings were observed under control and salt stress conditions."

"21115702","abstracttext","The ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola is an important pathogen of wheat that causes Septoria tritici blotch. Despite the serious impact of M. graminicola on wheat production worldwide, knowledge about its molecular biology is limited. The velvet gene, veA, is one of the key regulators of diverse cellular processes, including development and secondary metabolism in many fungi. However, the species analyzed to date are not related to the Dothideomycetes, the largest class of plant-pathogenic fungi, and the function of veA in this group is not known. To test the hypothesis that the velvet gene has similar functions in the Dothideomycetes, a veA-homologous gene, MVE1, was identified and gene deletion mutations (Δmve1) were generated in M. graminicola. All of the MVE1 mutants exhibited consistent pleiotropic phenotypes, indicating the involvement of MVE1 in multiple signaling pathways. Δmve1 strains displayed albino phenotypes with significant reductions in melanin biosynthesis and less production of aerial mycelia on agar plates. In liquid culture, Δmve1 strains showed abnormal hyphal swelling, which was suppressed completely by osmotic stress or lower temperature. In addition, MVE1 gene deletion led to hypersensitivity to shaking, reduced hydrophobicity, and blindness to light-dependent stimulation of aerial mycelium production. However, pathogenicity was not altered in Δmve1 strains. Therefore, the light-signaling pathway associated with MVE1 does not appear to be important for Septoria tritici blotch disease. Our data suggest that the MVE1 gene plays crucial roles in multiple key signaling pathways and is associated with light signaling in M. graminicola."

"23940768","abstracttext_background","Many insects enter a developmental arrest (diapause) that allows them to survive harsh seasonal conditions. Despite the well-established ecological significance of diapause, the molecular basis of this crucial adaptation remains largely unresolved. Sitodiplosis mosellana (Gehin), the orange wheat blossom midge (OWBM), causes serious damage to wheat throughout the northern hemisphere, and sporadic outbreaks occur in the world. Traits related to diapause appear to be important factors contributing to their rapid spread and outbreak. To better understand the diapause mechanisms of OWBM, we sequenced the transcriptome and determined the gene expression profile of this species."

These unigenes were annotated by Blastx alignment against the NCBI non-redundant (nr), Clusters of orthologous groups (COG), gene orthology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases. 20,802 unigenes (45.5% of the total) matched with protein in the NCBI nr database. Two digital gene expression (DGE) libraries were constructed to determine differences in gene expression profiles during diapause and non-diapause developmental stages.

"25761471","abstracttext","Ca plays an essential role in bone development; however, little is known about its effect on intestinal gene expression in juvenile animals. In the present study, thirty-two weaned pigs (9·5 (SEM 0·11) kg) were assigned to four diets that differed in Ca concentration (adequate v. high) and cereal composition (wheat-barley v. maize) to assess the jejunal and colonic gene expression of nutrient transporters, tight junction proteins, cytokines and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, nutrient digestibility, Ca balance and serum acute-phase response. To estimate the impact of mucosal bacteria on colonic gene expression, Spearman's correlations between colonic gene expression and bacterial abundance were computed. Faecal Ca excretion indicated that more Ca was available along the intestinal tract of the pigs fed high Ca diets as compared to the pigs fed adequate Ca diets (P> 0.05). High Ca diets decreased jejunal zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) and occludin (OCLN) expression, up-regulated jejunal expression of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and down-regulated colonic GLUT2 expression as compared to the adequate Ca diets (P< 0.05). Dietary cereal composition up-regulated jejunal TLR2 expression and interacted (P= 0.021) with dietary Ca on colonic IL1B expression; high Ca concentration up-regulated IL1B expression with wheat-barley diets and down-regulated it with maize diets. Spearman's correlations (r> 0·35; P< 0·05) indicated an association between operational taxonomic units assigned to the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria and bacterial metabolites and mucosal gene expression in the colon. The present results indicate that high Ca diets have the potential to modify the jejunal and colonic mucosal gene expression response which, in turn, interacts with the composition of the basal diet and mucosa-associated bacteria in weaned pigs."

"31815421","abstracttext","The etiology of fungal pathogenesis of grains is critical to global food security. The large number of orphan biosynthetic gene clusters uncovered in fungal plant pathogen genome sequencing projects suggests that we have a significant knowledge gap about the secondary metabolite repertoires of these pathogens and their roles in plant pathogenesis. Cytochalasans are a family of natural products of significant interest due to their ability to bind to actin and interfere with cellular processes that involved actin polymerization; however, our understanding of their biosynthesis and biological roles remains incomplete. Here, we identified a putative polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase (PKS-NRPS) gene cluster ( phm ) that was upregulated in the pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum during its infection on wheat. Overexpression of the transcription factor gene phmR encoded in the phm gene cluster resulted in the production of two leucine-derived cytochalasans, phomacins D and E ( 1 and 2 , respectively), and an acetonyl adduct phomacin F. Heterologous expression of the PKS-NRPS gene phmA and the trans -enoyl reductase (ER) gene phmE in Aspergillus nidulans resulted in the production of a novel 2-pyrrolidone precursor prephomacin. Reverse genetics and wheat seedling infection assays showed that Δ phmA mutants exhibited significantly reduced virulence compared to the wild type. We further demonstrated that both 1 and 2 showed potent actin polymerization-inhibitory activities and exhibited potentially monocot-specific antigerminative activities. The findings from this study have advanced our knowledge based on the biosynthesis and biological roles of cytochalasans, the latter of which could have significant implications for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of fungus-plant interactions."

"26467989","abstracttext_background","The recently identified Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) race TTKSK (Ug99) poses a severe threat to global wheat production because of its broad virulence on several widely deployed resistance genes. Additional virulences have been detected in the Ug99 group of races, and the spread of this race group has been documented across wheat growing regions in Africa, the Middle East (Yemen), and West Asia (Iran). Other broadly virulent Pgt races, such as TRTTF and TKTTF, present further difficulties in maintaining abundant genetic resistance for their effective use in wheat breeding against this destructive fungal disease of wheat. In an effort to identify loci conferring resistance to these races, a genome-wide association study was carried out on a panel of 250 spring wheat breeding lines from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), six wheat breeding programs in the United States and three wheat breeding programs in Canada."
"26467989","abstracttext_results","The lines included in this study were grouped into two major clusters, based on the results of principal component analysis using 23,976 SNP markers. Upon screening for adult plant resistance (APR) to Ug99 during 2013 and 2014 in artificial stem rust screening nurseries at Njoro, Kenya and at Debre Zeit, Ethiopia, several wheat lines were found to exhibit APR. The lines were also screened for resistance at the seedling stage against races TTKSK, TRTTF, and TKTTF at USDA-ARS Cereal Disease Laboratory in St. Paul, Minnesota; and only 9 of the 250 lines displayed seedling resistance to all the races. Using a mixed linear model, 27 SNP markers associated with APR against Ug99 were detected, including markers linked with the known APR gene Sr2. Using the same model, 23, 86, and 111 SNP markers associated with seedling resistance against races TTKSK, TRTTF, and TKTTF were identified, respectively. These included markers linked to the genes Sr8a and Sr11 providing seedling resistance to races TRTTF and TKTTF, respectively.

"30593453","abstracttext","Unraveling and exploiting mechanisms of disease resistance in cereal crops is currently limited by their large repeat-rich genomes and the lack of genetic recombination or cultivar (cv)-specific sequence information. We cloned the first leaf rust resistance gene Rph1 ( Rph1 a ) from cultivated barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) using ""MutChromSeq,"" a recently developed molecular genomics tool for the rapid cloning of genes in plants. Marker-trait association in the CI 9214/Stirling doubled haploid population mapped Rph1 to the short arm of chromosome 2H in a physical region of 1.3 megabases relative to the barley cv Morex reference assembly. A sodium azide mutant population in cv Sudan was generated and 10 mutants were confirmed by progeny-testing. Flow-sorted 2H chromosomes from Sudan (wild type) and six of the mutants were sequenced and compared to identify candidate genes for the Rph1 locus. MutChromSeq identified a single gene candidate encoding a coiled-coil nucleotide binding site Leucine-rich repeat (NLR) receptor protein that was altered in three different mutants. Further Sanger sequencing confirmed all three mutations and identified an additional two independent mutations within the same candidate gene. Phylogenetic analysis determined that Rph1 clustered separately from all previously cloned NLRs from the Triticeae and displayed highest sequence similarity (89%) with a homolog of the Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) disease resistance protein 1 protein in Triticum urartu In this study we determined the molecular basis for Rph1 -mediated resistance in cultivated barley enabling varietal improvement through diagnostic marker design, gene editing, and gene stacking technologies."

"15834696","abstracttext","Recently, electrophoretic analyses of waxy proteins in several hexaploid and tetraploid wheat accessions from worldwide collections have permitted the identification of new variants at the waxy loci, including allelic forms with different mobilities and partial null types. In this paper, the molecular characterization of mutated waxy loci in four bread wheat cultivars (two lacking the Wx-B1 and two lacking the Wx-D1 protein, respectively) and in four durum wheat cultivars (one lacking Wx-A1 and the remainder with Wx-B1 proteins showing different electrophoretic mobilities) was conducted by means of PCR, Southern and DNA sequence analyses. Three primer pairs were developed that identified six of the above-mentioned mutations and allowed their molecular description, providing a useful tool for further germplasm screening or marker assisted progeny selection in breeding programs involving the newly identified material. We have found that a complete gene deletion is responsible for a null allele at the Wx-B1 locus in one bread wheat line, whereas sequencing of the corresponding fragments showed a 724 bp deletion in the Wx-D1 locus in one line of bread wheat and an insertion of 89 bp in the Wx-A1 locus in one line of durum wheat, respectively. In addition, nucleotide substitutions and various insertions/deletions ranging from 3 to 30 bp were detected in the PCR fragments of one durum wheat line with a Wx-B1 protein with a different electrophoretic mobility. A fourth primer set, specific for this mutation, was consequently derived."

"14641473","abstracttext","Stripe rust is one of the most destructive diseases for wheat crops in China. Two stripe rust physiological strains, i.e. CYR30 (intern. name: 175E191) and CYR31 (intern. name: 293E175) have been the dominant and epidemic physiological strains since 1994. One Aegilops tauschii accession (SQ-214) from CIMMYT was found immune from or highly resistant to Chinese new stripe rust races CYR30 and CYR31 at adult stage. SQ-214 was crossed with a highly susceptible Ae. tauschii accession As-80. Analysis of data from F1-F2 populations of SQ-214/As-80 revealed that the resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. To exploit the resistance for wheat breeding, SQ-214 was crossed with Chinese Spring (CS) and backcrossed by two Chinese commercial wheat varieties MY26 and SW3243. The resistance from SQ-214 was suppressed in the F1 hybrids (CS/SQ-214) and the F2 population of CS/SQ-214//MY26. However, the resistance of SQ-214 was expressed in several F2 individuals of CS/SQ-214//SW3243. Eleven advanced lines with high level of resistance to the Chinese stripe rust CYR30 and CYR31 have been developed. This result suggested that SW3243 does not suppress the expression of the Chinese stripe rust and should be used as wheat germplasm for exploiting resistance of Ae. tauschii in wheat breeding. The gliadin electrophoretic pattern of the eleven advanced lines with high stripe rust resistances was compared with their parents SQ-214, CS and SW3243 by acid polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The omega-gliadin bands of Gli-Dt1 in Ae. tauschii SQ-214 were transferred to some advanced lines and freely expressed in common wheat genetic background. One of advanced lines possesses a null Gli-D1 allele, where the omega-gliadin bands encoding by the Gli-D1 allele were absent. The potential utilization of this advanced line for wheat quality and stripe rust resistance breeding is also discussed in this paper."

"18289500","abstracttext","Development of transgenic triticale as a platform for novel bio-industrial products is predicated on an environmental biosafety assessment that quantifies the potential risks associated with its release. Pollen-mediated gene flow to related species and conventional triticale varieties is one pathway for transgene movement. A tier 1 quantification of triticale hybridization was conducted by emasculating and hand pollinating flowers under greenhouse conditions. Approximately 2000 manual pollinations were conducted for each cross and its reciprocal between two triticale genotypes: a modern triticale cultivar (AC Alta) and primary triticale (89TT108), and common wheat, durum wheat and rye. The frequency of outcrossing, hybrid seed appearance and weight, and F(1) emergence and fertility were recorded. Outcrossing, F(1) emergence and fertility rates were high from crosses between triticale genotypes. Outcrossing in inter-specific crosses was influenced by the species, and the genotype and gender of the triticale parent. In crosses to common and durum wheat where triticale was the male parent, outcrossing was > or =73.0% and > or =69.5%, respectively, but < or =23.9% and < or =3.0% when triticale was the female parent. Overall, outcrossing with rye was lower than with common and durum wheat. F(1) hybrid emergence was greater when triticale was the female parent. With the exception of a single seed, all wheat-triticale F(1) hybrid seeds were non-viable when triticale was the male parent in the cross. Only seven durum wheat-triticale F(1) hybrids emerged from 163 seeds sown, and all were produced with triticale 89TT108 as female parent. With rye, 8 F(1) hybrids emerged from 38 seeds sown, and all were produced from crosses to AC Alta; five with AC Alta as the female parent and three as the male. Interspecific F(1) hybrids were self-sterile, with the exception of those produced in crosses between common wheat and triticale where triticale was the female parent. Tier 2 hybridization quantification will be conducted under field conditions."

"16391695","abstracttext","'Lindström' wheat (AABBDD+rye B chromosomes) was used to study the effects of alien chromatin introgressed into a wheat genetic background, subjecting the wheat genome to a new and transient allopolyploidisation episode. Using this experimental material, we have previously demonstrated that no large-scale chromosomal translocations occurred as a result of the genomic constitution of the addition line. However, we have shown that the presence of a number of rye B chromosomes is associated with changes in the interphase organization and expression patterns of wheat rDNA loci. We have now extended our studies to focus on a further characterization of 'Lindström' 5S rDNA loci and also on high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) patterns. In the process, we have uncovered an unusually large variant of the 5S rDNA locus on wheat chromosome 1B (not to be confused with rye B chromosomes) and 2 novel HMW glutenin y-type alleles. These changes are not directly related to variation in rye B chromosome number in the present material, but the fact that a new, and still segregating, 1Dy HMW-GS gene was identified indicates a recent timescale for its origin. Strikingly, the 'Lindström' 5S rDNA 1B locus integrates a unit sharing 94% homology with a rye 5S rDNA sequence, suggesting the possibility that the wheat locus was colonized by highly homologous rye sequences during the breeding of 'Lindström', when the rye and wheat genomes were together, albeit briefly, in the same nucleus."

These proteins contain a number of important celiac disease (CD)-immunogenic domains. The alpha-gliadins expressed from the Gli-B2 locus harbour fewer conserved CD-epitopes than those from Gli-A2, whereas the Gli-D2 gliadins have the highest CD-immunogenic potential. In order to detect differences in the highly CD-immunogenic alpha-gliadin fraction we determined the relative expression level from the homoeologous Gli-2 loci in various tetraploid and hexaploid wheat genotypes by using a quantitative pyrosequencing method and by analyzing expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences."

The relative Gli-A2 expression level in a tetraploid durum wheat cultivar ('Probstdorfer Pandur') was 41%. In genotypes derived from landraces, the Gli-A2 frequency varied between 12% and 58%. In some advanced hexaploid bread wheat cultivars the genes from locus Gli-B2 were hardly expressed (e.g., less than 5% in 'Lavett') but in others they made up more than 40% (e.g., in 'Baldus')."
"19171027","abstracttext_conclusion","Here, we have shown that large differences exist in relative expression levels of alpha-gliadins from the homoeologous Gli-2 loci among wheat genotypes. Since the homoelogous genes differ in the amount of conserved CD-epitopes, screening for differential expression from the homoeologous Gli-2 loci can be employed for the pre-selection of wheat varieties in the search for varieties with very low CD-immunogenic potential. Pyrosequencing is a method that can be employed for such a 'gene family-specific quantitative transcriptome profiling'."

"20495873","abstracttext","The fungus Fusarium globosum was first isolated from maize in South Africa and subsequently from wheat in Japan. Here, multiple analyses revealed that, despite morphological similarities, South African maize and Japanese wheat isolates of the fungus exhibit multiple differences. An amplified fragment length polymorphism-based similarity index for the two groups of isolates was only 45%. Most maize isolates produced relatively high levels of fumonisins, whereas wheat isolates produced little or no fumonisins. The fumonisin biosynthetic gene FUM1 was detected in maize isolates by Southern blot analysis but not in the wheat isolates. In addition, most of the maize isolates produced sclerotia, and all of them produced large orange to dark purple sporodochia in carrot agar culture, whereas wheat isolates did not produce either structure. In contrast, individual isolates from both maize and wheat carried markers for both mating type idiomorphs, which indicates that the fungus may be homothallic. However, a sexual stage of F. globosum was not formed under standard self-fertilization conditions developed for other homothallic species of Fusarium. The inability to produce the sexual stage is consistent with the high similarity of 87-100% and G (ST) index of 1.72 for the maize isolates, which suggests that these isolates are undergoing asexual but not sexual reproduction. Together, the results suggest that the South African maize and Japanese wheat isolates of F. globosum are distinct populations and could be different species."

However, the specific VOCs responsible for R. padi responses are unknown. It is unclear also if R. padi responses to BYDV-infected wheat are caused by arrestment or attraction. Additionally, the responses of viruliferous apterae and nonviruliferous alate to BYDV-infected wheat have not been examined. R. padi responses were studied through emigration, immigration, and settling laboratory bioassays using BYDV-infected and noninfected wheat plants. Two wheat genotypes, virus-susceptible Lambert and virus-resistant Lambert-derived transgenic 103.1J expressing the BYDV-PAV coat protein gene, were evaluated. In a settling bioassay, alates preferentially settled on noninfected 103.1J. Responses of viruliferous and nonviruliferous R. padi to virus-infected, noninfected, and sham-inoculated (exposed to nonviruliferous aphids) Lambert and 103.1J were examined in separate bioassays. A paper leaf model served as a control. Immigration by viruliferous apterae was significantly lower toward the paper leaf model, but no significant differences were observed among plant treatments. Nonviruliferous apterae exhibited no significant differences in emigration among treatments, suggesting no arrestment occurred. Nonviruliferous apterae significantly preferred to immigrate toward BYDV-infected Lambert. Immigration toward the paper leaf model was significantly lower compared with plant treatments. Responses of R. padi to VOCs were tested by applying compounds to paper leaf models at concentrations designed to mimic those present in headspace of wheat plants. Nonviruliferous apterae immigrated in significantly greater numbers toward paper leaf models individually treated with nonanal, (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, decanal, caryophyllene, and undecane than toward paper leaf models that served as controls and toward leaf models treated with synthetic blends made to mimic headspace of BYDV-infected compared with blends made to mimic headspace of noninfected wheat plants. Results suggest responses of R. padi to BYDV-infected plants are caused by attraction rather than arrestment."

"21760909","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust is a destructive disease in the cool and humid wheat-growing areas of the world. Finding diverse sources of stripe rust resistance is critical for increasing genetic diversity of resistance for wheat breeding programs. Stripe rust resistance was identified in the alien species Psathyrostachys huashanica, and a wheat-P. huashanica amphiploid line (PHW-SA) with stripe rust resistance was reported previously. In this study, a P. huashanica 3Ns monosomic addition line (PW11) with superior resistance to stripe rust was developed, which was derived from the cross between PHW-SA and wheat J-11. We evaluated the alien introgressions PW11-2, PW11-5 and PW11-8 which were derived from line PW11 for reaction to new Pst race CYR32, and used molecular and cytogenetic tools to characterize these lines. The introgressions were remarkably resistant to CYR32, suggesting that the resistance to stripe rust of the introgressions thus was controlled by gene(s) located on P. huashanica chromosome 3Ns. All derived lines were cytologically stable in term of meiotic chromosome behavior. Two 3Ns chromosomes of P. huashanica were detected in the disomic addition line PW11-2. Chromosomes 1B of substitution line PW11-5 had been replaced by a pair of P. huashanica 3Ns chromosomes. In PW11-8, a small terminal segment from P. huashanica chromosome arm 3NsS was translocated to the terminal region of wheat chromosomes 3BL. Thus, this translocated chromosome is designated T3BL-3NsS. These conclusions were further confirmed by SSR analyses. Two 3Ns-specific markers Xgwm181 and Xgwm161 will be useful to rapidly identify and trace the translocated fragments. These introgressions, which had significant characteristics of resistance to stripe rust, could be utilized as novel germplasms for wheat breeding."

"23015203","abstracttext","Carotenoid β-hydroxylases attach hydroxyl groups to the β-ionone rings (β-rings) of carotenoid substrates, resulting in modified structures and functions of carotenoid molecules. We cloned and characterized two genes (each with three homeologs), HYD1 and HYD2, which encode β-hydroxylases in wheat. The results from bioinformatic and nested degenerate PCR analyses collectively suggest that HYD1 and HYD2 may represent the entire complement of non-heme di-iron β-hydroxylases in wheat. The homeologs of wheat HYDs exhibited major β-ring and minor ε-ring hydroxylation activities in carotenoid-accumulating E. coli strains. Distinct expression patterns were observed for different HYD genes and homeologs in vegetative tissues and developing grains of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, suggesting their functional divergence and differential regulatory control in tissue-, grain development-, and ploidy-specific manners. An intriguing observation was that the expression of HYD1, particularly HYD-B1, reached highest levels at the last stage of tetraploid and hexaploid grain development, suggesting that carotenoids (at least xanthophylls) were still actively synthesized in mature grains. This result challenges the common perception that carotenoids are simply being turned over during wheat grain development after their initial biosynthesis at the early grain development stages. Overall, this improved understanding of carotenoid biosynthetic gene expression and carotenoid metabolism in wheat grains will contribute to the improvement of the nutritional value of wheat grains for human consumption."

"22970701","abstracttext","Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), the cause of wheat streak mosaic, is a widespread and damaging pathogen of wheat. WSMV is not a chronic problem of annual wheat in the United States Pacific Northwest but could negatively affect the establishment of perennial wheat, which is being developed as an alternative to annual wheat to prevent soil erosion. Fifty local isolates of WSMV were collected from 2008 to 2010 near Lewiston, ID, Pullman, WA, and the United States Department of Agriculture Central Ferry Research Station, near Pomeroy, WA to determine the amount of genetic variation present in the region. The coat protein gene from each isolate was sequenced and the data subjected to four different methods of phylogenetic analyses. Two well-supported clades of WSMV were identified. Isolates in clade I share sequence similarity with isolates from Central Europe; this is the first report of isolates from Central Europe being reported in the United States. Isolates in clade II are similar to isolates originating from Australia, Argentina, and the American Pacific Northwest. Nine isolates showed evidence of recombination and the same two well-supported clades were observed when recombinant isolates were omitted from the analysis. More polymorphic sites, parsimony informative sites, and increased diversity were observed in clade II than clade I, suggesting more recent establishment of the virus in the latter. The observed diversity within both clades could make breeding for durable disease resistance in perennial wheat difficult if there is a differential response of WSMV resistance genes to isolates from different clades."

"24794619","abstracttext","This study aimed at investigating the addition of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours to wheat flour bread. Type I sourdough containing legumes or wheat-legume flours were prepared and propagated (back slopped) in laboratory, according to traditional protocols that are routinely used for making typical Italian breads. Based on kinetic of acidification and culture-dependent data, the wheat-legume sourdough was further characterized and selected for bread making. As determined by RAPD-PCR and partial sequencing of 16S rDNA gene analyses, lactic acid bacteria in wheat-legume sourdough included Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus fermentum, Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus pentosus, Lactobacillus coryneformis, Lactobacillus rossiae, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus parabuchneri and Lactobacillus paraplantarum. Two breads containing 15% (w/w) of legume (chickpea, lentil and bean) flours were produced using selected wheat-legume sourdough (WLSB) and traditional wheat sourdough (WSB). Compared to wheat yeasted bread (WYB), the level of total free amino acids (FAA) was higher in WSB and WLSB. Phytase and antioxidant activities were the highest in WLSB. Compared to bread WYB, the addition of legume flours decreased the in vitro protein digestibility (IVPD) (WYB versus WSB). However, the dough fermentation with WSLB favored an increase of IVPD. According to the levels of carbohydrates, dietary fibers and resistant starch, WSB and WLSB showed lower values of hydrolysis index (HI) compared to WYB. As showed by texture and image analyses and sensory evaluation of breads, a good acceptability was found for WSB and, especially, WLSB breads."

"24086561","abstracttext","Hexaploid bread wheat contains A, B, and D three subgenomes with its well-characterized ancestral genomes existed at diploid and tetraploid levels, making the wheat act as a good model species for studying evolutionary genomic dynamics. Here, we performed intra- and inter-species comparative analyses of wheat and related grass genomes to examine the dynamics of homologous regions surrounding Rht-1, a well-known ""green revolution"" gene. Our results showed that the divergence of the two A genomes in the Rht-1 region from the diploid and tetraploid species is greater than that from the tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. The divergence of D genome between diploid and hexaploid is lower than those of A genome, suggesting that D genome diverged latter than others. The divergence among the A, B and D subgenomes was larger than that among different ploidy levels for each subgenome which mainly resulted from genomic structural variation of insertions and, perhaps deletions, of the repetitive sequences. Meanwhile, the repetitive sequences caused genome expansion further after the divergence of the three subgenomes. However, several conserved non-coding sequences were identified to be shared among the three subgenomes of wheat, suggesting that they may have played an important role to maintain the homolog of three subgenomes. This is a pilot study on evolutionary dynamics across the wheat ploids, subgenomes and differently related grasses. Our results gained new insights into evolutionary dynamics of Rht-1 region at sequence level as well as the evolution of wheat during the plolyploidization process."
"24162414","articletitle","STS-PCR markers appropriate for wheat-barley introgression."
"24162414","abstracttext","Introgression of chromosomal segments across large taxonomic distances has long been an objective of scientists interested in understanding the relationships between genes and their effect on phenotype. Barley and wheat represent cultivated members of the Triticeae with different zones of adaptation, different responses to pathogens, and different end-use characteristics. Introduction of small, well-characterized chromosomal segments among grass relatives presents an opportunity to both better understand how genes perform in novel genomic environments and to learn more about the evolutionary novelties which differentiate related species. Since the distribution of the wheat-barley addition lines, the potential power and value of a comprehensive series of wheat/barley translocation lines has been widely appreciated. A scarcity of easy-touse markers which unambiguously distinguish barley loci from their wheat homologues has limited the ability of scientists to identify the relatively rare inter-chromosomal recombination events which are the necessary antecedents of these lines. Since the single most critical pathogen affecting U.S. wheat producers is Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica) and since barley carries a gene conferring immunity, molecular markers may prove practically and immediately important. In this report we describe a series of 135 barley-specific markers amplified by 115 primer sets developed from sequences from previously mapped restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers. These easily distinguish the cognate barley products from their wheat counterparts and should find ready use in the identification of lines which contain wheat/barley translocation events."

"24250219","abstracttext","Major facilitators of water movement through plant cell membranes include aquaporin proteins. Wheat is among the largest and most important cereal crops worldwide; however, unlike other model plants such as rice, maize and Arabidopsis, little has been reported on wheat major intrinsic proteins (MIPs). This study presents a comprehensive computational identification of 349 new wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs), encoding 13 wheat aquaporin genes. Identified aquaporins consist of 6 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins (PIP) and 1 TIP showing high sequence similarity with rice aquaporins. We also identified 4 NOD26-like intrinsic proteins (NIP) and 2 SIP members that showed more divergence. Further, expression analysis of the aquaporin genes using the available EST information in UniGene revealed their transcripts were differentially regulated in various stress- and tissue-specific libraries. Allele specific Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers based on single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were designed using PIP as the target gene and validated on a core set of Indian wheat genotypes. A 3D theoretical model of the wheat aquaporin protein was built by homology modeling and could prove to be useful in the further functional characterization of this protein. Collectively with expression and bioinformatics analysis, our results support the idea that the genes identified in this study signify an important genetic resource providing potential targets to modify the water use properties of wheat."

"26191068","abstracttext","The ABCC multidrug resistance associated proteins (ABCC-MRP), a subclass of ABC transporters are involved in multiple physiological processes that include cellular homeostasis, metal detoxification, and transport of glutathione-conjugates. Although they are well-studied in humans, yeast, and Arabidopsis, limited efforts have been made to address their possible role in crop like wheat. In the present work, 18 wheat ABCC-MRP proteins were identified that showed the uniform distribution with sub-families from rice and Arabidopsis. Organ-specific quantitative expression analysis of wheat ABCC genes indicated significantly higher accumulation in roots (TaABCC2, TaABCC3, and TaABCC11 and TaABCC12), stem (TaABCC1), leaves (TaABCC16 and TaABCC17), flag leaf (TaABCC14 and TaABCC15), and seeds (TaABCC6, TaABCC8, TaABCC12, TaABCC13, and TaABCC17) implicating their role in the respective tissues. Differential transcript expression patterns were observed for TaABCC genes during grain maturation speculating their role during seed development. Hormone treatment experiments indicated that some of the ABCC genes could be transcriptionally regulated during seed development. In the presence of Cd or hydrogen peroxide, distinct molecular expression of wheat ABCC genes was observed in the wheat seedlings, suggesting their possible role during heavy metal generated oxidative stress. Functional characterization of the wheat transporter, TaABCC13 a homolog of maize LPA1 confirms its role in glutathione-mediated detoxification pathway and is able to utilize adenine biosynthetic intermediates as a substrate. This is the first comprehensive inventory of wheat ABCC-MRP gene subfamily."

"25366770","abstracttext","The 1BL.1RS wheat-rye translocation contained in the Russian cultivar Aurora has been the most widespread alien translocation in wheat-breeding programs all over the world. However, following the prevalence of new biotypes of the pathogens, disease-resistance genes in this translocation chromosome have been overcome and consequently they have been eliminated in modern wheat-breeding programs. In this paper, we report on 12 new primary 1BL.1RS translocation lines derived from the crosses of a Chinese high yield wheat cv. Mianyang 11 with three rye cultivars collected from China. GISH, C-banding and PCR techniques using the specific primers for 1BS, 1RS and centromeres of wheat and rye were applied to identify the constitution of chromosomes. The results confirmed that all 1BL.1RS chromosomes in the 12 primary translocation lines contained integrated 1RS chromosome arms. In the resistance analysis using five kinds of Pst pathotypes, the 12 primary translocation lines showed diversity resistance to stripe rust, which contained at least five different new genes (alleles), significantly different from the Yr9 gene coming from Russian wheat cultivar Aurora. The results indicated that the chromosome arm 1RS in the rye population carries abundant yet untapped genes (alleles) for resistance to wheat stripe rust, which would originate from the neutral diversity in the natural population of rye. It is suggested that creating more primary translocation lines in genome modification will be extremely important to use the diversity of alien R-genes, which was generated by long-term neutral mutation and maintained in the population of alien species."

"25503087","abstracttext","Small heat shock proteins (sHSPs) are chaperones that play an important role in various developmental, biotic and abiotic stresses. The sHSP family possess a conserved domain of approximately 80 to 100 amino acids called alpha-crystalline domain (ACD), flanked by N- and C-terminal regions. Search for complete proteomes and expressed sequenced tag (EST) database of wheat and barley using Hidden Markov Model and BLAST algorithm was conducted. Here, we report genome-wide identification and characterization of 27 newly TaHSP20 candidate genes in wheat and 13 HvHSP20 in barley, describing structures, phylogenetic relationships, conserved protein motifs, and expression patterns. The structural analysis highlights that this gene family possesses a conserved ACD region at the C-terminal. Detailed pattern analysis of HSP20 revealed presence of P-G doublet and I/V/L-X-I/V/L motif that helps in oligomerization. Identification of conserved motif sequences of wheat and barley HSP20 strongly supported their identity as sHSP families. This study illustrates for the first time 3D model prediction of full-length wheat HSP20 (TaHSP20) protein and ACD region. Digital expression analysis was also carried out in order to reveal a widespread distribution of the sHSP family genes at various developmental stages of wheat and barley. In addition, five selected transcripts of both wheat and barley were validated for their expression profile under 35 °C and 42 °C heat stress conditions. Results indicate up-regulation of all the transcripts under heat stress condition except TaCBM38894 candidate, which showed down-regulation in wheat."

"25247402","abstracttext","The introduction of genetic variation from wild and cultivated Triticeae species has been a long-standing approach for wheat improvement. Dasypyrum breviaristatum species harbor novel and agronomically important genes for resistance against multi-fungal diseases. The development of new wheat-D. breviaristatum introgression lines offers chances for the identification of stripe rust resistance gene(s). A wheat line, D11-5, was selected from a cross between wheat line MY11 and wheat-D. breviaristatum partial amphiploid TDH-2. It was characterized by FISH and PCR-based molecular markers. Chromosome counting revealed that the D11-5 line shows a hexaploid set of 2n = 6x = 42 chromosomes. FISH analysis using the Dasypyrum repetitive sequence pDb12H as a probe demonstrated that D11-5 contained a pair of D. breviaristatum chromosomes, while FISH with wheat D-genomic repetitive sequences revealed that the chromosome 2D was absent in D11-5. The functional molecular markers confirmed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosomes belong to the homoeologous group 2, indicating that D11-5 was a 2V(b) (2D) disomic substitution line. Field resistance showed that the introduced D. breviaristatum chromosomes 2V(b) were responsible for the stripe rust resistance at the adult plant stage. FISH, C-banding, and PCR-based molecular marker analysis indicated that the chromosome 2V(b) of D. breviaristatum was completely different from the chromosome 2V of D. villosum. The identified wheat-D. breviaristatum chromosome substitution line D11-5 may be applied to produce agronomically desirable stripe rust resistance germplasm."

"25260759","abstracttext_background","Crown rust, caused by Puccinia coronata f. sp. avenae, is the most important disease of oat worldwide. Adult plant resistance (APR), based upon partial resistance, has proven to be a durable rust management strategy in other cereal rust pathosystems. The crown rust APR in the oat line MN841801 has been effective for more than 30 years. The genetic basis of this APR was studied under field conditions in three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations: 1) AC Assiniboia/MN841801, 2) AC Medallion/MN841801, and 3) Makuru/MN841801. The populations were evaluated for crown rust resistance with the crown rust isolate CR251 (race BRBB) in multiple environments. The 6 K oat and 90 K wheat Illumina Infinium single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays were used for genotyping the AC Assiniboia/MN841801 population. KASP assays were designed for selected SNPs and genotyped on the other two populations."
"25260759","abstracttext_results","This study reports a high density genetic linkage map constructed with oat and wheat SNP markers in the AC Assiniboia/MN841801 RIL population. Most wheat SNPs were monomorphic in the oat population. However the polymorphic wheat SNPs could be scored accurately and integrated well into the linkage map. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) on oat chromosome 14D, designated QPc.crc-14D, explained up to 76% of the APR phenotypic variance. This QTL is flanked by two SNP markers, GMI_GBS_90753 and GMI_ES14_c1439_83. QPc.crc-14D was validated in the populations AC Medallion/MN841801 and Makuru/MN841801."

QPc.crc-14D was statistically significant in all environments tested in each of the three oat populations. QPc.crc-14D is a suitable candidate for use in marker-assisted breeding and also an excellent target for map-based cloning. This is also the first study to use the 90 K wheat Infinium SNP array on oat for marker development and comparative mapping. The Infinium SNP array is a useful tool for saturating oat maps with markers. Synteny with wheat suggests that QPc.crc-14D is orthologous with the stripe rust APR gene Yr16 in wheat."

"27115051","abstracttext","The jasmonic acid (JA) signaling pathway plays key roles in a diverse array of plant development, reproduction, and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Most of our understanding of the JA signaling pathway derives from the dicot model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, while corresponding knowledge in wheat is somewhat limited. In this study, the expression of 41 genes implicated in the JA signaling pathway has been assessed on 10 day-old bread wheat seedlings, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h after methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) treatment using quantitative real-time PCR. The examined genes have been previously reported to be involved in JA biosynthesis and catabolism, JA perception and signaling, and pathogen defense in wheat shoots and roots. This study provides evidence to suggest that the effect of MeJA treatment is more prominent in shoots than roots of wheat seedlings, and substantial regulation of the JA pathway-dependent defense genes occurs at 72 h after MeJA treatment. Results show that the expression of 22 genes was significantly affected by MeJA treatment in wheat shoots. However, only PR1.1 and PR3 were significantly differentially expressed in wheat roots, both at 24 h post-MeJA treatment, with other genes showing large variation in their gene expression in roots. While providing marker genes on JA signaling in wheat, future work may focus on elucidating the regulatory function of JA-modulated transcription factors, some of which have well-studied potential orthologs in Arabidopsis."

"27329140","abstracttext_background","In cereal crops such as wheat, an optimal timing of developmental transitions is required to maximize grain yield. Many of these developmental changes are precisely regulated by changes in the duration, intensity or quality of light. Phytochromes are dimeric photoreceptors that absorb light maximally in the red and far-red wavelengths and induce large-scale transcriptional changes in response to variation in light quality. In wheat, PHYC is required for early flowering under long days. However, it is currently unknown whether this function requires the presence of PHYB. In this study, we characterized the role of PHYB in wheat development and used RNA-seq to analyze and compare the transcriptomes of phyB-null and phyC-null TILLING mutants."
"27329140","abstracttext_results","Under long-day photoperiods, phyB-null plants exhibit a severe delay in flowering comparable to the delay observed in phyC-null plants. These results demonstrate that both genes are required for the induction of wheat flowering under long days. Using replicated RNA-seq studies we identified 82 genes that are significantly up or down regulated in both the phyB-null and phyC-null mutant relative to their respective wild-type controls. Among these genes are several well-characterized positive regulators of flowering, including PPD1, FT1 and VRN1. Eight-fold more genes were differentially regulated only in the phyB-null mutant (2202) than only in the phyC-null mutant (261). The PHYB-regulated genes were enriched in components of the auxin, gibberellin and brassinosteroid biosynthesis and signaling pathways, and in transcription factors with putative roles in regulating vegetative development and shade-avoidance responses. Several genes involved in abiotic stress tolerance pathways were also found to be regulated by PHYB."
"27329140","abstracttext_conclusions","PHYB and PHYC are both required for the photoperiodic induction of wheat flowering, whereas PHYB alone regulates a large number of genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and signaling, shade-avoidance response, and abiotic stress tolerance. Our analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the PHYB- and PHYC-mediated transcriptional changes during light signaling, and an initial step towards the dissection of this regulatory gene network in wheat. This further dissection will be required to explore the individual phytochrome-mediated developmental responses and to evaluate their potential to improve wheat adaptation to changing environments."

"28656363","abstracttext_key message","A major locus for resistance to different Fusarium diseases was mapped to the most distal end of Th. elongatum 7EL and pyramided with Th. ponticum beneficial genes onto wheat 7DL. Perennial Triticeae species of the Thinopyrum genus are among the richest sources of valuable genes/QTL for wheat improvement. One notable and yet unexploited attribute is the exceptionally effective resistance to a major wheat disease worldwide, Fusarium head blight, associated with the long arm of Thinopyrum elongatum chromosome 7E (7EL). We targeted the transfer of the temporarily designated Fhb-7EL locus into bread wheat, pyramiding it with a Th. ponticum 7el 1 L segment stably inserted into the 7DL arm of wheat line T4. Desirable genes/QTL mapped along the T4 7el 1 L segment determine resistance to wheat rusts (Lr19, Sr25) and enhancement of yield-related traits. Mapping of the Fhb-7EL QTL, prerequisite for successful pyramiding, was established here on the basis of a bioassay with Fusarium graminearum of different 7EL-7el 1 L bread wheat recombinant lines. These were obtained without resorting to any genetic pairing promotion, but relying on the close 7EL-7el 1 L homoeology, resulting in 20% pairing frequency between the two arms. Fhb-7EL resided in the telomeric portion and resistant recombinants could be isolated with useful combinations of more proximally located 7el 1 L genes/QTL. The transferred Fhb-7EL locus was shown to reduce disease severity and fungal biomass in grains of infected recombinants by over 95%. The same Fhb-7EL was, for the first time, proved to be effective also against F. culmorum and F. pseudograminearum, predominant agents of crown rot. Prebreeding lines possessing a suitable 7EL-7el 1 L gene/QTL assembly showed very promising yield performance in preliminary field tests."

"29333241","abstracttext","In this article, we present a joint effort of the wheat research community, along with data and ontology experts, to develop wheat data interoperability guidelines. Interoperability is the ability of two or more systems and devices to cooperate and exchange data, and interpret that shared information. Interoperability is a growing concern to the wheat scientific community, and agriculture in general, as the need to interpret the deluge of data obtained through high-throughput technologies grows. Agreeing on common data formats, metadata, and vocabulary standards is an important step to obtain the required data interoperability level in order to add value by encouraging data sharing, and subsequently facilitate the extraction of new information from existing and new datasets. During a period of more than 18 months, the RDA Wheat Data Interoperability Working Group (WDI-WG) surveyed the wheat research community about the use of data standards, then discussed and selected a set of recommendations based on consensual criteria. The recommendations promote standards for data types identified by the wheat research community as the most important for the coming years: nucleotide sequence variants, genome annotations, phenotypes, germplasm data, gene expression experiments, and physical maps. For each of these data types, the guidelines recommend best practices in terms of use of data formats, metadata standards and ontologies. In addition to the best practices, the guidelines provide examples of tools and implementations that are likely to facilitate the adoption of the recommendations. To maximize the adoption of the recommendations, the WDI-WG used a community-driven approach that involved the wheat research community from the start, took into account their needs and practices, and provided them with a framework to keep the recommendations up to date. We also report this approach's potential to be generalizable to other (agricultural) domains."
"29326749","articletitle","Introgression of the Aegilops speltoides Su1-Ph1 Suppressor into Wheat."
"29326749","abstracttext","Meiotic pairing between homoeologous chromosomes in polyploid wheat is inhibited by the Ph1 locus on the long arm of chromosome 5 in the B genome. Aegilops speltoides (genomes SS), the closest relative of the progenitor of the wheat B genome, is polymorphic for genetic suppression of Ph1. Using this polymorphism, two major suppressor loci, Su1-Ph1 and Su2-Ph1 , have been mapped in Ae. speltoides. Su1-Ph1 is located in the distal, high-recombination region of the long arm of the Ae. speltoides chromosome 3S. Its location and tight linkage to marker Xpsr1205-3S makes Su1-Ph1 a suitable target for introgression into wheat. Here, Xpsr1205-3S was introgressed into hexaploid bread wheat cv. Chinese Spring (CS) and from there into tetraploid durum wheat cv. Langdon (LDN). Sequential fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic in situ hybridization showed that an Ae. speltoides segment with Xpsr1205-3S replaced the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 3A. In the CS genetic background, the chromosome induced homoeologous chromosome pairing in interspecific hybrids with Ae. peregrina but not in progenies from crosses involving alien disomic substitution lines. In the LDN genetic background, the chromosome induced homoeologous chromosome pairing in both interspecific hybrids and progenies from crosses involving alien disomic substitution lines. We conclude that the recombined chromosome harbors Su1-Ph1 but its expression requires expression of complementary gene that is present in LDN but absent in CS. We suggest that it is unlikely that Su1-Ph1 and ZIP4-1 , a paralog of Ph1 located on wheat chromosomes 3A and 3B and Ae. tauschii chromosome 3D, are equivalent. The utility of Su1-Ph1 for induction of recombination between homoeologous chromosomes in wheat is illustrated."

"28241006","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn.) is one of the most destructive diseases world-wide. Races belonging to Ug99 (or TTKSK) continue to cause crop losses in East Africa and threaten global wheat production. Developing and deploying wheat varieties with multiple race-specific genes or complex adult plant resistance is necessary to achieve durability. In the present study, we applied genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for identifying loci associated with the Ug99 stem rust resistance (SR) in a panel of wheat lines developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT). Genotyping was carried out using the wheat 9K iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip. Phenotyping was done in the field in Kenya by infection of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKST, the Sr24-virulent variant of Ug99. Marker-trait association identified 12 SNP markers significantly associated with resistance. Among them, 7 were mapped on five chromosomes. Markers located on chromosomes 4A and 4B overlapped with the location of the Ug99 resistance genes SrND643 and Sr37, respectively. Markers identified on 7DL were collocated with Sr25. Additional significant markers were located in the regions where no Sr gene has been reported. The chromosome location for five of the SNP markers was unknown. A BLASTN search of the NCBI database using the flanking sequences of the SNPs associated with Ug99 resistance revealed that several markers were linked to plant disease resistance analogues, while others were linked to regulatory factors or metabolic enzymes. A KASP (Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR) assay was used for validating six marker loci linked to genes with resistance to Ug99. Of those, four co-segregated with the Sr25-pathotypes while the rest identified unknown resistance genes. With further investigation, these markers can be used for marker-assisted selection in breeding for Ug99 stem rust resistance in wheat."

"29731763","abstracttext","Wild relatives provide an important source of useful traits in wheat breeding. Wheat and wild relative hybrids have been widely used in breeding programs to introduce such traits into wheat. However, successful introgression is limited by the low frequency of homoeologous crossover (CO) between wheat and wild relative chromosomes. Hybrids between wheat carrying a 70 Mb deletion on chromosome 5B ( ph1b ) and wild relatives, have been exploited to increase the level of homoeologous CO, allowing chromosome exchange between their chromosomes. In ph1b -rye hybrids, CO number increases from a mean of 1 CO to 7 COs per cell. CO number can be further increased up to a mean of 12 COs per cell in these ph1b hybrids by treating the plants with Hoagland solution. More recently, it was shown that the major meiotic crossover gene ZIP4 on chromosome 5B ( TaZIP4-B2 ) within the 70 Mb deletion, was responsible for the restriction of homoeologous COs in wheat-wild relative hybrids, confirming the ph1b phenotype as a complete Tazip4-B2 deletion mutant ( Tazip4-B2 ph1b) . In this study, we have identified the particular Hoagland solution constituent responsible for the increased chiasma frequency in Tazip4-B2 ph1b mutant-rye hybrids and extended the analysis to Tazip4-B2 TILLING and CRISPR mutant- Ae variabilis hybrids. Chiasma frequency at meiotic metaphase I, in the absence of each Hoagland solution macronutrient (NH 4 H 2 PO 4 , KNO 3 , Ca (NO 3 )2·4H 2 O or Mg SO 4 ·7H 2 O) was analyzed. A significant decrease in homoeologous CO frequency was observed when the Mg 2+ ion was absent. A significant increase of homoeologous CO frequency was observed in all analyzed hybrids, when plants were irrigated with a 1 mM Mg 2+ solution.

"29582247","abstracttext_key message","Three EDS1 genes were cloned from common wheat and were demonstrated to positively regulate resistance to powdery mildew in wheat. The EDS1 proteins play important roles in plant basal resistance and TIR-NB-LRR protein-triggered resistance in dicots. Until now, there have been very few studies on EDS1 in monocots, and none in wheat. Here, we report on three common wheat orthologous genes of EDS1 family (TaEDS1-5A, 5B and 5D) and their function in powdery mildew resistance. Comparisons of these genes with their orthologs in diploid ancestors revealed that EDS1 is a conserved gene family in Triticeae. The cDNA sequence similarity among the three TaEDS1 genes was greater than 96.5%, and they shared sequence similarities of more than 99.6% with the respective orthologs from diploid ancestors. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the EDS1 family originated prior to the differentiation of monocots and dicots, and EDS1 members have since undergone clear structural differentiation. The transcriptional levels of TaEDS1 genes in the leaves were obviously higher than those of the other organs, and they were induced by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) infection and salicylic acid (SA) treatment. The BSMV-VIGS experiments indicated that knock-down the transcriptional levels of the TaEDS1 genes in a powdery mildew-resistant variety of common wheat compromised resistance. Contrarily, transient overexpression of TaEDS1 genes in a susceptible common wheat variety significantly reduced the haustorium index and attenuated the growth of Bgt. Furthermore, the expression of TaEDS1 genes in the Arabidopsis mutant eds1-1 complemented its susceptible phenotype to powdery mildew. The above evidences strongly suggest that TaEDS1 acts as a positive regulator and confers resistance against powdery mildew in common wheat."

"29587653","abstracttext_background","The tertiary gene pool of bread wheat, to which Leymus racemosus belongs, has remained underutilized due to the current limited genomic resources of the species that constitute it. Continuous enrichment of public databases with useful information regarding these species is, therefore, needed to provide insights on their genome structures and aid successful utilization of their genes to develop improved wheat cultivars for effective management of environmental stresses."
"29587653","abstracttext_results","We generated de novo DNA and mRNA sequence information of L. racemosus and developed 110 polymorphic PCR-based markers from the data, and to complement the PCR markers, DArT-seq genotyping was applied to develop additional 9990 SNP markers. Approximately 52% of all the markers enabled us to clearly genotype 22 wheat-L. racemosus chromosome introgression lines, and L. racemosus chromosome-specific markers were highly efficient in detailed characterization of the translocation and recombination lines analyzed. A further analysis revealed remarkable transferability of the PCR markers to three other important Triticeae perennial species: L. mollis, Psathyrostachys huashanica and Elymus ciliaris, indicating their suitability for characterizing wheat-alien chromosome introgressions carrying chromosomes of these genomes."
"29587653","abstracttext_conclusion","The efficiency of the markers in characterizing wheat-L. racemosus chromosome introgression lines proves their reliability, and their high transferability further broadens their scope of application. This is the first report on sequencing and development of markers from L. racemosus genome and the application of DArT-seq to develop markers from a perennial wild relative of wheat, marking a paradigm shift from the seeming concentration of the technology on cultivated species. Integration of these markers with appropriate cytogenetic methods would accelerate development and characterization of wheat-alien chromosome introgression lines."

"31057594","abstracttext","Low spring temperatures often occur during the winter wheat booting stage, when the young ears are very sensitive to cold. In this study, we used two wheat varieties differing in cold sensitivity (sensitive variety Yangmai 18 and tolerant variety Yannong 19) to examine the effect of low temperature on wheat grain number at booting stage. Low temperature stress was simulated in an artificial climate chamber at 4°C for 60 h in 2016 and at 2, 0, or -2°C for 24 h in morphological assays, showing that the development of wheat spikelets was inhibited and floret growth was delayed following low temperature stress. However, an increase in the sucrose content of young panicles was also observed, and the activity of enzymes involved in sucrose metabolism was dynamically altered. Sucrose phosphate synthase activity was enhanced, and sucrose synthase activity significantly increased after treatment at 4 and 2°C, respectively. However, activities of sucrose synthase and invertase decreased with a reduction in temperature. Gene expression assays further revealed downregulation of TaSuS1 expression and upregulation of TaSuS2 , while expression of CWINV was inhibited. Moreover, phytohormone content assays showed an increase in the content of abscisic acid in young wheat ears, but a decrease in the content of auxin and gibberellins. The grain number per spike and 1000-grain weight also showed a downward trend following low temperature stress. Overall, these findings suggest that low temperature at booting induces abscisic acid accumulation in winter wheat, altering the activity of the enzymes involved in sucrose metabolism, which leads to an accumulation of sucrose in the young ears, thereby having a negative effect on wheat production."

"31160891","abstracttext_background","Bread wheat is one of the most important crops in the world. Its domestication coincides with the beginning of agriculture and since then, it has been constantly under selection by humans. Its breeding has followed millennia of cultivation, sometimes with unintended selection on adaptive traits, and later by applying intentional but empirical selective pressures. For more than one century, wheat breeding has been based on science, and has been constantly evolving due to on farm agronomy and breeding program improvements. The aim of this work is to briefly review wheat breeding, with emphasis on the current advances."
"31160891","abstracttext_discussion","Improving yield potential, resistance/tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and baking quality, have been priorities for breeding this cereal, however, new objectives are arising, such as biofortification enhancement. The narrow genetic diversity and complexity of its genome have hampered the breeding progress and the application of biotechnology. Old approaches, such as the introgression from relative species, mutagenesis, and hybrid breeding are strongly reappearing, motivated by an accumulation of knowledge and new technologies. A revolution has taken place regarding the use of molecular markers whereby thousands of plants can be routinely genotyped for thousands of loci. After 13 years, the wheat reference genome sequence and annotation has finally been completed, and is currently available to the scientific community. Transgenics, an unusual approach for wheat improvement, still represents a potential tool, however it is being replaced by gene editing, whose technology along with genomic selection, speed breeding, and high-throughput phenotyping make up the most recent frontiers for future wheat improvement."

"31125282","abstracttext","Tritrophic interactions involving a biocontrol agent, a pathogen, and a plant have been analyzed predominantly from the perspective of the biocontrol agent. To explore the adaptive strategies of wheat in response to beneficial, pathogenic, and combined microorganisms, we performed the first comprehensive transcriptomic, proteomic, and biochemical analysis in wheat roots after exposure to Bacillus velezensis CC09, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici , and their combined colonization, respectively. The transcriptional or translational programming of wheat roots inoculated with beneficial B. velezensis showed mild alterations compared with that of pathogenic G. graminis var. tritici . However, the combination of B. velezensis and G. graminis var. tritici activated a larger transcriptional or translational program than for each single microorganism, although the gene expression pattern was similar to that of individual infection by G. graminis var. tritici , suggesting a prioritization of defense against G. graminis var. tritici infection. Surprisingly, pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity and effector-triggered immunity made wheat pretreated with B. velezensis more sensitive to subsequent G. graminis var. tritici infection. Additionally, B. velezensis triggered a salicylic acid (SA)-dependent mode of induced systemic resistance that resembles pathogen-induced systemic acquired resistance. Wheat plants mainly depend on SA-mediated resistance, and not that mediated by jasmonic acid (JA), against the necrotrophic pathogen G. graminis var. tritici. Moreover, SA-JA interactions resulted in antagonistic effects regardless of the type of microorganisms in wheat. Further enhancement of SA-dependent defense responses such as lignification to the combined infection was shown to reduce the level of induced JA-dependent defense against subsequent infection with G. graminis var. tritici . Altogether, our results demonstrate how the hexaploid monocot wheat responds to beneficial or pathogenic microorganisms and prolongs the onset of take-all disease through modulation of cell reprogramming and signaling events."
"32469925","articletitle","Modeling Aceria tosichella biotype distribution over geographic space and time."
"32469925","abstracttext","The wheat curl mite, Aceria tosichella Keifer, one of the most destructive arthropod pests of bread wheat worldwide, inflicts significant annual reductions in grain yields. Moreover, A. tosichella is the only vector for several economically important wheat viruses in the Americas, Australia and Europe. To date, mite-resistant wheat genotypes have proven to be one of the most effective methods of controlling the A. tosichella-virus complex. Thus, it is important to elucidate A. tosichella population genetic structure, in order to better predict improved mite and virus management. Two genetically distinct A. tosichella lineages occur as pests of wheat in Australia, Europe, North America, South America and the Middle East. These lineages are known as type 1 and type 2 in Australia and North America and in Europe and South America as MT-8 and MT-1, respectively. Type 1 and type 2 mites in Australia and North America are delineated by internal transcribed spacer 1 region (ITS1) and cytochrome oxidase I region (COI) sequence differences. In North America, two A. tosichella genotypes known as biotypes are recognized by their response to the Cmc3 mite resistance gene in wheat. Aceria tosichella biotype 1 is susceptible to Cmc3 and biotype 2 is virulent to Cmc3. In this study, ITS1 and COI sequence differences in 25 different populations of A. tosichella of known biotype 1 or biotype 2 composition were characterized for ITS1 and COI sequence differences and used to model spatio-temporal dynamics based on biotype prevalence. Results showed that the proportion of biotype 1 and 2 varies both spatially and temporally. Greater ranges of cropland and grassland within 5000m of the sample site, as well as higher mean monthly precipitation during the month prior to sampling appear to reduce the probability of occurrence of biotype 1 and increase the probability of occurrence of biotype 2. The results suggest that spatio-temporal modeling can effectively improve A. tosichella management. Continual integration of additional current and future precipitation and ground cover data into the existing model will further improve the accuracy of predicting the occurrence of A. tosichella in annual wheat crops, allowing producers to make informed decisions about the selection of varieties with different A. tosichella resistance genes."

"30109563","abstracttext_key message","The current review provides an updated, new insights into the regulation of transcription mediated underlying mechanisms of wheat plants to osmotic stress perturbations. Osmotic stress tolerance mechanisms being complex are governed by multiple factors at physiological, biochemical and at the molecular level, hence approaches like ""OMICS"" that can underpin mechanisms behind osmotic tolerance in wheat is of paramount importance. The transcription factors (TFs) are a class of molecular proteins, which are involved in regulation, modulation and orchestrating the responses of plants to a variety of environmental stresses. Recent reports have provided novel insights on the role of TFs in osmotic stress tolerance via direct molecular links. However, our knowledge on the regulatory role TFs during osmotic stress tolerance in wheat remains limited. The present review in its first part sheds light on the importance of studying the role of osmotic stress tolerance in wheat plants and second aims to decipher molecular mechanisms of TFs belonging to several classes, including DREB, NAC, MYB, WRKY and bHLH, which have been reported to engage in osmotic stress mediated gene expression in wheat and third part covers the systems biology approaches to understand the transcriptional regulation of osmotic stress and the role of long non-coding RNAs in response to osmotic stress with special emphasis on wheat. The current concept may lead to an understanding in molecular regulation and signalling interaction of TFs under osmotic stress to clarify challenges and problems for devising potential strategies to improve complex regulatory events involved in plant tolerance to osmotic stress adaptive pathways in wheat."

"30153643","abstracttext","Drought stress is considered a critical environmental factor that negatively affects wheat growth and development, which causes considerable losses in wheat yields worldwide. More recently, numerous microRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to be involved in wheat responses to drought stresses. However, there is little information regarding the effects of He-Ne laser irradiation on the expression traits of miRNAs and their targets in wheat seedlings exposed to drought stress. In the current study, therefore, a combination of physiological and molecular approaches was used to assess the effect of He-Ne laser irradiation on the expression of miRNAs and their targets in wheat seedlings exposed to drought stress. Our results demonstrated that drought stress significantly reduced plant height, root length, shoot and root fresh weight, relative water content, the expression level and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), enhanced malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration in the wheat seedlings. However, He-Ne laser irradiation significantly enhanced the activities of SOD, ascorbate peroxidase (APX), peroxidase (POD) and relative water content, and reduced MDA concentration of seedlings by regulating gene expression for SOD, POD, APX. In addition, in comparison with drought stress alone, miR160, miR164 and miR398 transcripts were down-regulated, and expression levels of its targets auxin response factor (ARF22), NAC domain transcription factor and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutases (CSD) were up-regulated in He-Ne laser irradiated seedlings exposed to drought stress. These results suggested that He-Ne laser irradiation could possible protection of drought stress, at least partially, by increasing the transcript levels and activities of SOD, POD and APX, and decreasing the transcript levels of miR160, miR164 and miR398. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to present biochemical and molecular evidence supporting the effect of He-Ne laser irradiation on the alleviation of drought stress in wheat seedlings mediated by miRNA expression."

"30754517","abstracttext","The race Ug99 of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici causing stem rust disease of wheat was initially identified in Uganda in 1998. It was designated as TTKSK based on the North American nomenclature and has caused periodic losses to wheat crops in East Africa. Ug99 has recently moved out of Africa to Yemen and West Asia. The most effective approach to prevent losses from stem rust is through the deployment of resistant cultivars. More effective sources of resistance need to be identified and incorporated in the existing commercial cultivars. The first Stem Rust Resistance Screening Nursery (1stSRRSN) assembled by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) consisted of elite and advanced CIMMYT bread wheat lines and was evaluated for resistance to Ug99 in Njoro, Kenya for four consecutive seasons (2005 to 2007). Seedling reactions were determined in the greenhouse at the Cereal Disease Laboratory, St. Paul, MN. Two race-specific genes, Sr24 and Sr25, were found to confer resistance to Ug99, although Sr24 became ineffective to a mutant race of Ug99, TTKST, in 2007. Three previously uncharacterized genes, one each from synthetic wheat, Chinese germplasm, and other genetic backgrounds, were detected. Although 30% of the screened lines were susceptible in the seedling stage, these lines displayed various levels of adult plant resistance (APR) in the field tests. Presence of the APR gene Sr2, identified based on the pseudo-black chaff phenotype on glumes and darkened internode, was common in wheat lines with APR. The information on the resistance identified in the 1stSRRSN constitutes an important source for breeding wheat for durable resistance."

"30780999","abstracttext","Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) was found for the first time in Australia in 2002. It subsequently was found widely dispersed around the continent and was shown to be seedborne in wheat. The coat protein (CP) gene sequences of nine WSMV isolates from eastern and southwestern Australia are reported, one obtained directly from infected wheat seed, three from seedlings grown from infected wheat seed, and five from infected wheat plant samples. These sequences were compared with those of 66 WSMV CP sequences, including eight previously sequenced Australian isolates. All 17 Australian sequences formed a closely knit monophyletic cluster as part of the D1 subclade of WSMV previously only reported from the Pacific Northwest of the United States. The close phylogenetic relationships of these sequences indicate that the Australian outbreak arose from a single incursion, the source of which appears to be the Pacific Northwest. Three Australian CP sequences were identical, one from the location of the post-entry quarantine facility at Tamworth, New South Wales, and two from seed that had originally been propagated at that facility. These three sequences were closest to the Pacific Northwest sequences and differed from them by as little as eight nucleotides (0.76%). The sequence of a third seedborne isolate originally from the same source differed from the other two seedborne isolates by two nucleotides, indicating that the immigrant WSMV population may have been variable. The other Australian sequences differed from the three identical ones by only one to four nucleotides. The phylogenetic pattern and small number of nucleotide differences between individual isolates from different geographic locations fit the scenario that the virus was introduced once in seed of wheat breeding material, multiplied where it was introduced, and then was dispersed over long distances around the Australian continent along standard distribution routes for wheat breeding lines, germ plasm, and crop seed. These conclusions provide a cautionary tale indicating the importance of effective monitoring of imported plant materials for exotic virus diseases during post-entry quarantine."

"30253117","abstracttext","The blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is comprised of lineages that exhibit varying degrees of specificity on about 50 grass hosts, including rice, wheat, and barley. Reliable diagnostic tools are essential given that the pathogen has a propensity to jump to new hosts and spread to new geographic regions. Of particular concern is wheat blast, which has suddenly appeared in Bangladesh in 2016 before spreading to neighboring India. In these Asian countries, wheat blast strains are now co-occurring with the destructive rice blast pathogen raising the possibility of genetic exchange between these destructive pathogens. We assessed the recently described MoT3 diagnostic assay and found that it did not distinguish between wheat and rice blast isolates from Bangladesh. The assay is based on primers matching the WB12 sequence corresponding to a fragment of the M. oryzae MGG_02337 gene annotated as a short chain dehydrogenase. These primers could not reliably distinguish between wheat and rice blast isolates from Bangladesh based on DNA amplification experiments performed in separate laboratories in Bangladesh and in the United Kingdom. Specifically, all eight rice blast isolates tested in this study produced the WB12 amplicon. In addition, comparative genomics of the WB12 nucleotide sequence revealed a complex underlying genetic structure with related sequences across M. oryzae strains and in both rice and wheat blast isolates. We, therefore, caution against the indiscriminate use of this assay to identify wheat blast and encourage further development of the assay to ensure its value in diagnosis."

In Egypt, high powdery mildew severity has been observed in the past few years on many commercial cultivars of both bread and durum wheat. Little information is available about virulence characteristics of the Egyptian B. graminis f. sp. tritici population in Egypt or the resistance of Egyptian wheat cultivars to powdery mildew. Virulence frequencies of a representative sample of the Egyptian B. graminis f. sp. tritici population were studied. Seven provinces were chosen to represent the country: two in Upper Egypt (Qena and Sohag), one in Middle Egypt (El Minia), and four in the north (Alexandria, Kafr Elsheikh, Dakahlia, and Sharqia). Ten isolates from each province (70 isolates total) were derived from single ascospores and used for this study. They were inoculated individually on 21 powdery mildew differential lines, each bearing a single resistance (Pm) gene. Also, the responses of 14 Egyptian bread wheat cultivars and 6 durum cultivars to each of the 70 isolates were evaluated individually. Among all tested Pm genes, only seven (Pm1b, Pm2, Pm21, Pm34, Pm36, Pm37, and Pm53) were effective against B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates from all provinces. Several other genes were effective against most or all isolates from a majority of provinces. All tested bread wheat cultivars showed full susceptibility to all isolates, whereas two durum wheat cultivars, Beni-Suef-5 and Beni-Suef-6, had intermediate responses to a large percentage of the isolates, likely indicating partial resistance. To enhance mildew resistance in Egyptian wheat cultivars, it is recommended to use combinations of genes that are nationally effective or effective against multiple provincial B. graminis f. sp. tritici populations."

A total of 65 virulence phenotypes were identified among the 469 single uredinial isolates that were tested on 20 near-isogenic lines of Thatcher wheat that differ for leaf rust resistance genes. Virulence phenotypes MBTNB at 11.3% of the overall population, and MCTNB at 7.0%, were the first and third most common phenotypes. Both phenotypes were found mostly in the southeastern states and Ohio Valley region. Phenotype TFTSB at 10.9% was the second most common phenotype and was found mostly in southern Texas. Virulence to leaf rust resistance gene Lr39 , which is present in hard red winter wheat cultivars, was highest in the Great Plains region. Virulence to Lr11 and Lr18 , which are present in soft red winter wheat cultivars, was highest in the southeastern states and Ohio Valley region. Virulence to Lr21 , which is present in hard red spring wheat cultivars, was highest in the northern Great Plains region.

"31379901","abstracttext","Uncovering the genetic basis of key agronomic traits, and particularly of drought tolerance, addresses an important priority for durum wheat improvement. Here, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 493 durum wheat accessions representing a worldwide collection was employed to address the genetic basis of 17 agronomically important traits and a drought wilting score. Using a linear mixed model with 4 inferred subpopulations and a kinship matrix, we identified 90 marker-trait-associations (MTAs) defined by 78 markers. These markers could be merged into 44 genomic loci by linkage disequilibrium ( r 2 > 0.2). Based on sequence alignment of the markers to the reference genome of bread wheat, we identified 14 putative candidate genes involved in enzymes, hormone-response, and transcription factors. The GWAS in durum wheat and a previous quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis in bread wheat identified a consensus QTL locus.4B.1 conferring drought tolerance, which was further scanned for the presence of potential candidate genes. A haplotype analysis of this region revealed that two minor haplotypes were associated with both drought tolerance and reduced plant stature, thought to be the effect of linkage with the semi-dwarfing gene Rht-B1 . Haplotype variants in the key chromosome 4B region were informative regarding evolutionary divergence among durum, emmer and bread wheat. Over all, the data are relevant in the context of durum wheat improvement and the isolation of genes underlying variation in some important quantitative traits."
"31585498","articletitle","Towards coeliac-safe bread."
"31585498","abstracttext","Gluten-free foods cannot substitute for products made from wheat flour. When wheat products are digested, the remaining peptides can trigger an autoimmune disease in 1% of the North American and European population, called coeliac disease. Because wheat proteins are encoded by a large gene family, it has been impossible to use conventional breeding to select wheat varieties that are coeliac-safe. However, one can test the properties of protein variants by expressing single genes in coeliac-safe cereals like maize. One source of protein that can be considered as coeliac-safe and has bread-making properties is teff (Eragrostis tef), a grain consumed in Ethiopia. Here, we show that teff α-globulin3 (Etglo3) forms storage vacuoles in maize that are morphologically similar to those of wheat. Using transmission electron microscopy, immunogold labelling shows that Etglo3 is almost exclusively deposited in the storage vacuole as electron-dense aggregates. Of maize seed storage proteins, 27-kDa γ-zein is co-deposited with Etglo3. Etglo3 polymerizes via intermolecular disulphide bonds in maize, similar to wheat HMW glutenins under non-reducing conditions. Crossing maize Etglo3 transgenic lines with α-, β- and γ-zein RNA interference (RNAi) lines reveals that Etglo3 accumulation is only dramatically reduced in γ-zein RNAi background. This suggests that Etglo3 and 27-kDa γ-zein together cause storage vacuole formation and behave similar to the interactions of glutenins and gliadins in wheat. Therefore, expression of teff α-globulins in maize presents a major step in the development of a coeliac-safe grain with bread-making properties."

Biofortification of wheat cultivars for micronutrients is a priority research area for wheat geneticists and breeders. It is known that during breeding of wheat cultivars for productivity and quality, a loss of grain micronutrient contents occurred, leading to decline in nutritional quality of wheat grain. Keeping this in view, major efforts have been made during the last two decades for achieving biofortification and bioavailability of wheat grain for micronutrients including Zn, Fe and Se. The studies conducted so far included evaluation of gene pools for contents of not only grain micronutrients as above, but also for phytic acid (PA) or phytate and phytase, so that, while breeding for the micronutrients, bioavailability is also improved. For this purpose, QTL interval mapping and GWAS were carried out to identify QTLs/genes and associated markers that were subsequently used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) during breeding for biofortification. Studies have also been conducted to understand the physiology and molecular basis of biofortification, which also allowed identification of genes for uptake, transport and storage of micronutrients. Transgenics using transgenes have also been produced. The breeding efforts led to the development of at least a dozen cultivars with improved contents of grain micronutrients, although land area occupied by these biofortified cultivars is still marginal. In this review, the available information on different aspects of biofortification and bioavailability of micronutrients including Zn, Fe and Se in wheat has been reviewed for the benefit of those, who plan to start work or already conducting research in this area."

Well over 4130 of the total 4276 differentially expressed lncRNAs were already specifically expressed at 12 h postinoculation (hpi), but only 89 of these were specifically expressed at 24 hpi, indicating that the initial stage was the crucial stage for lncRNA-mediated gene regulation of wheat defense against F. graminearum . Target analysis showed the lncRNAs participated in various biological stress processes and had exclusive regulation models at different infection stages. Further H 2 O 2 accumulation and protein ubiquitination assays supported this idea. Moreover, two lncRNAs (XLOC_302848 and XLOC_321638) were identified as Fusarium seedling blight resistance candidates by lncRNA-target expression pattern validation, and two lncRNAs (XLOC_113815, XLOC_123624) were Fusarium head blight resistance potential regulators by cross-validating the RNAseq data with the refined meta-QTL of wheat FHB resistance. These findings extend our knowledge on wheat lncRNAs response to F. graminearum attack and provide new insights for the functional and molecular research of future interactions between wheat and Fusarium ."

"33050873","abstracttext_background","Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks.) is one of the most dangerous diseases of common wheat worldwide. Three approaches: genome-wide association study (GWAS), marker-assisted selection (MAS) and phytopathological evaluation in field, were used for assessment of the genetic diversity of Russian spring wheat varieties on leaf rust resistance loci and for identification of associated molecular markers."
"33050873","abstracttext_results","The collection, consisting of 100 Russian varieties of spring wheat, was evaluated over three seasons for resistance to the native population of leaf rust specific to the West Siberian region of Russia. The results indicated that most cultivars showed high susceptibility to P. triticina, with severity ratings (SR) of 60S-90S, however some cultivars showed a high level of leaf rust resistance (SR < 20MR-R). Based on the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) performed using the wheat 15 K genotyping array, 20 SNPs located on chromosomes 6D, 6A, 6B, 5A, 1B, 2A, 2B and 7A were revealed to be associated with leaf rust resistance. Genotyping with markers developed for known leaf rust resistance genes showed that most of the varieties contain genes Lr1, Lr3a, Lr9, Lr10, Lr17a, Lr20, Lr26 and Lr34, which are not currently effective against the pathogen. In the genome of three wheat varieties, gene Lr6Ai = 2 inherited from Th. intermedium was detected, which provides complete protection against the rust pathogen. It has been suggested that the QTL mapped to the chromosome 5AS of wheat cultivar Tulaikovskaya-zolotistaya, Tulaikovskaya-10, Samsar, and Volgouralskaya may be a new, previously undescribed locus conferring resistance to leaf rust. Obtained results also indicate that chromosome 1BL of the varieties Sonata, Otrada-Sibiri, Tertsiya, Omskaya-23, Tulaikovskaya-1, Obskaya-14, and Sirena may contain an unknown locus that provides a resistance response to local population."
"33050873","abstracttext_conclusions","This study provides new insights into the genetic basis of resistance to leaf rust in Russian spring wheat varieties. The SNPs significantly associated with leaf rust resistance can be used for the development and application of diagnostic markers in marker-assisted selection schemes."

"33167859","abstracttext_backgrounds","Fatty acid desaturases (FADs) introduce a double bond into the fatty acids acyl chain resulting in unsaturated fatty acids that have essential roles in plant development and response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Wheat germ oil, one of the important by-products of wheat, can be a good alternative for edible oils with clinical advantages due to the high amount of unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, we performed a genome-wide analysis of the wheat FAD gene family (TaFADs)."
"33167859","abstracttext_results","68 FAD genes were identified from the wheat genome. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, wheat FADs clustered into five subfamilies, including FAB2, FAD2/FAD6, FAD4, DES/SLD, and FAD3/FAD7/FAD8. The TaFADs were distributed on chromosomes 2A-7B with 0 to 10 introns. The Ka/Ks ratio was less than one for most of the duplicated pair genes revealed that the function of the genes had been maintained during the evolution. Several cis-acting elements related to hormones and stresses in the TaFADs promoters indicated the role of these genes in plant development and responses to environmental stresses. Likewise, 72 SSRs and 91 miRNAs in 36 and 47 TaFADs have been identified. According to RNA-seq data analysis, the highest expression in all developmental stages and tissues was related to TaFAB2.5, TaFAB2.12, TaFAB2.15, TaFAB2.17, TaFAB2.20, TaFAD2.1, TaFAD2.6, and TaFAD2.8 genes while the highest expression in response to temperature stress was related to TaFAD2.6, TaFAD2.8, TaFAB2.15, TaFAB2.17, and TaFAB2.20. Furthermore, docking simulations revealed several residues in the active site of TaFAD2.6 and TaFAD2.8 in close contact with the docked oleic acid that could be useful in future site-directed mutagenesis studies to increase the catalytic efficiency of them and subsequently improve agronomic quality and tolerance of wheat against environmental stresses."

"10076003","articletitle","Plant cell-directed control of virion sense gene expression in wheat dwarf virus."
"10076003","abstracttext","We have used particle bombardment (biolistics) to deliver replication-competent wheat dwarf virus (WDV)-based constructs, carrying reporter gene sequences fused to the virion sense promoter (Pv) or the CaMV 35S promoter, to suspension culture cells and immature zygotic embryos of wheat. While the replication of WDV double-stranded DNA forms (replicons) was equivalent between wheat suspension culture cells and embryos, GUS reporter gene activity was 20-40 times higher in the embryo cultures. Maximum expression of WDV replicons occurred in the embryonic axis tissue of wheat embryos but their expression in suspension cells was compromised, compared with transiently maintained input plasmid DNA containing the same sequences. From these studies, we propose that WDV replicons are subject to a host cell-controlled competency for virion sense transcription. The term competency is used to distinguish between the phenomenon described here and control of gene expression by specific transcription factors. Control of competency is independent of Pv, the replacement 35S promoter and of the complementary sense control of virion sense expression involving specific sequences in Pv. We propose that factors controlling the competency for replicon expression may be present in cells which, as well as maintaining high rates of DNA synthesis, are totipotent. Cell type control of active chromatin, methylation of specific sequences in WDV minichromosomes and/or interaction of virus-encoded proteins with specific host factors are considered as possible mechanisms."

"10323226","abstracttext","To date, few mutations in wheat have been characterized at the molecular level. In this study, the mutations in the three waxy alleles in waxy wheat (Wx-A1h, Wx-B1b and Wx-D1b) were characterized, and waxy gene expression was compared in several wheat lines, including hexaploid and tetraploid waxy lines of wheat. Southern analysis showed that the Wx-B1b allele had sustained a deletion which included the entire coding region of the Wx-B1 gene. DNA homologous to waxy gene sequences was still present in the Wx-A1b and Wx-D1b alleles of the hexaploid waxy mutant. Transcripts of waxy alleles were also detected in both hexaploid and tetraploid mutants at 10 days post-anthesis, but the transcript level was dramatically reduced compared to that found in non-waxy lines. Isolation of cDNAs showed that transcripts were produced by both the Wx-A1b and Wx-D1b alleles. A 23-bp deletion sustained by the Wx-A1b allele at an exon-intron junction results in the use of a cryptic splice site during mRNA processing. The deduced translation product encoded by the Wx-A1b cDNA lacks 39 amino acids, including the putative ADP-glucose binding site and a portion of the transit peptide. The C-terminal region of the deduced protein encoded by the Wx-D1b cDNA lacks the last 30 amino acids. Comparison of the genomic sequences of the null and wild-type Wx-D1 alleles indicated that 588 bp were deleted in the Wx-D1b mutation, and that the last 261 bp of the Wx-D1b cDNA originated from the normally non-transcribed 3' flanking region. Like several deletion mutations characterized in other plant species, both Wx-A1b and Wx-D1b alleles contain small DNA insertions, or filler DNA, between the deletion end-points."

"12598580","abstracttext","Genes encoding pathogenesis-related (PR-) proteins isolated from a cDNA library of Fusarium graminearum-infected wheat spikes of scab-resistant cultivar 'Sumai-3' were transformed into susceptible spring wheat, 'Bobwhite' using a biolistic transformation protocol, with the goal of enhancing levels of resistance against scab. Twenty-four putative transgenic lines expressing either a single PR-protein gene or combinations thereof were regenerated. Transgene expression in a majority of these lines (20) was completely silenced in the T(1) or T(2) generations. Four transgenic wheat lines showed stable inheritance and expression of either a single transgene or transgene combinations up to four generations. One line co-expressing a chitinase and beta-1,3-glucanase gene combination, when bioassayed against scab showed a delay in the spread of the infection (type II resistance) under greenhouse conditions. This line and a second transgenic line expressing a rice thaumatin-like protein gene (tlp) which had moderate resistance to scab in previous greenhouse trials, along with susceptible and resistance checks were evaluated for resistance to scab under field conditions. None of the transgenic lines had resistance to scab in the field under conditions of strong pathogen, suggesting these plants lacked effective resistance to initial infection (type I resistance) under these conditions. As far as is known, this is the first report of field evaluation of transgenic wheat expressing genes for PR-proteins against disease resistance."
"15753584","articletitle","Allopolyploidy--a shaping force in the evolution of wheat genomes."
"15753584","abstracttext","Recent studies have shown that allopolyploidy accelerates genome evolution in wheat in two ways: (1) allopolyploidization triggers rapid genome changes (revolutionary changes) through the instantaneous generation of a variety of cardinal genetic and epigenetic alterations, and (2) the allopolyploid condition facilitates sporadic genomic changes during the life of the species (evolutionary changes) that are not attainable at the diploid level. The revolutionary changes comprise (1) non-random elimination of coding and non-coding DNA sequences, (2) epigenetic changes such as DNA methylation of coding and non-coding DNA leading, among others, to gene silencing, (3) activation of genes and retroelements which in turn alters the expression of adjacent genes. These highly reproducible changes occur in the F1 hybrids or in the first generation(s) of the nascent allopolyploids and were similar to those that occurred twice in nature: first in the formation of allotetraploid wheat (approximately 0.5 million years ago) and second in the formation of hexaploid wheat (approximately 10,000 years ago). Elimination of non-coding sequences from one of the two homoeologous pairs in tetraploids and from two homoeologous pairs in hexaploids, augments the differentiation of homoeologous chromosomes at the polyploid level, thus providing the physical basis for the diploid-like meiotic behavior of allopolyploid wheat. Regulation of gene expression may lead to improved inter-genomic interactions. Gene inactivation brings about rapid diploidization while activation of genes through demethylation or through transcriptional activation of retroelements altering the expression of adjacent genes, leads to novel expression patterns. The evolutionary changes comprise (1) horizontal inter-genomic transfer of chromosome segments between the constituent genomes, (2) production of recombinant genomes through hybridization and introgression between different allopolyploid species or, more seldom, between allopolyploids and diploids, and (3) mutations. These phenomena, emphasizing the plasticity of the genome with regards to both structure and function, might improve the adaptability of the newly formed allopolyploids and facilitate their rapid and successful establishment in nature."
"16468023","articletitle","A hAT superfamily transposase recruited by the cereal grass genome."
"16468023","abstracttext","Transposable elements are ubiquitous genomic parasites with an ancient history of coexistence with their hosts. A few cases have emerged recently where these genetic elements have been recruited for normal function in the host organism. We have identified an expressed hobo/Ac/Tam (hAT) family transposase-like gene in cereal grasses which appears to represent such a case. This gene, which we have called gary, is found in one or two copies in barley, two diverged copies in rice and two very similar copies in hexaploid wheat. No gary homologues are found in Arabidopsis. In all three cereal species, an apparently complete 2.5 kb transposase-like open reading frame is present and nucleotide substitution data show evidence for positive selection, yet the predicted gary protein is probably not an active transposase, as judged by the absence of key amino acids required for transposase function. Gary is expressed in wheat and barley spikes and gary cDNA sequences are also found in rice, oat, rye, maize, sorghum and sugarcane. The short inverted terminal repeats, flanked by an eight-nucleotide host sequence duplication, which are characteristic of a hAT transposon are absent. Genetic mapping in barley shows that gary is located on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 2H. Wheat homologues of gary map to the same approximate location on the wheat group 2 chromosomes by physical bin-mapping and the more closely related of the two rice garys maps to the syntenic location near the bottom of rice chromosome 4. These data suggest that gary has resided in a single genomic location for at least 60 Myr and has lost the ability to transpose, yet expresses a transposase-related protein that is being conserved under host selection. We propose that the gary transposase-like gene has been recruited by the cereal grasses for an unknown function."

"17479240","abstracttext","Lr1 is a dominant leaf rust resistance gene located on chromosome 5DL of bread wheat and the wild species Aegilops tauschii. In this study, three polymorphic markers (WR001, WR002, and WR003) were developed from resistance gene analogs (RGAs) clustering around the Lr1 locus. Using these and other markers, Lr1 was mapped to a genetic interval of 0.79 cM in Ae. tauschii and 0.075 cM in wheat. The CAPS marker WR003, derived from LR1RGA1, co-segregated with Lr1 in both mapping populations of wheat and Ae. tauschii. For isolation of Lr1, two genomic BAC libraries (from Ae. tauschii and hexaploid wheat) were screened using the tightly flanking marker PSR567F and a set of nested primers derived from the conserved region of the RGA sequences. Approximately 400 kb BAC contig spanning the Lr1 locus was constructed. The LR1RGA1 encoding a CC-NBS-leucine-rich repeat (LRR) type of protein was the only one of the four RGAs at the Lr1 locus, which co-segregated with leaf rust resistance. Therefore, it represents a very good candidate for Lr1. The allelic sequences of LR1RGA1 from resistant and susceptible lines revealed a divergent DNA sequence block of approximately 605 bp encoding the LRR repeats 9-15, whereas the rest of the sequences were mostly identical. Within this sequence block, the 48 non-synonymous changes resulted in 44 amino acid differences. This indicates that LR1RGA1 likely evolved through one or more recombination or gene conversion events with unknown genes."

"20624958","articletitle","A unique wheat disease resistance-like gene governs effector-triggered susceptibility to necrotrophic pathogens."
"20624958","abstracttext","Plant disease resistance is often conferred by genes with nucleotide binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) or serine/threonine protein kinase (S/TPK) domains. Much less is known about mechanisms of susceptibility, particularly to necrotrophic fungal pathogens. The pathogens that cause the diseases tan spot and Stagonospora nodorum blotch on wheat produce effectors (host-selective toxins) that induce susceptibility in wheat lines harboring corresponding toxin sensitivity genes. The effector ToxA is produced by both pathogens, and sensitivity to ToxA is governed by the Tsn1 gene on wheat chromosome arm 5BL. Here, we report the cloning of Tsn1, which was found to have disease resistance gene-like features, including S/TPK and NBS-LRR domains. Mutagenesis revealed that all three domains are required for ToxA sensitivity, and hence disease susceptibility. Tsn1 is unique to ToxA-sensitive genotypes, and insensitive genotypes are null. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis indicated that Tsn1 arose in the B-genome diploid progenitor of polyploid wheat through a gene-fusion event that gave rise to its unique structure. Although Tsn1 is necessary to mediate ToxA recognition, yeast two-hybrid experiments suggested that the Tsn1 protein does not interact directly with ToxA. Tsn1 transcription is tightly regulated by the circadian clock and light, providing further evidence that Tsn1-ToxA interactions are associated with photosynthesis pathways. This work suggests that these necrotrophic pathogens may thrive by subverting the resistance mechanisms acquired by plants to combat other pathogens."

"19184460","abstracttext","Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) has been recently recognized as an emerging model system for both comparative and functional genomics in grass species. In this study, 55,221 repeat masked Brachypodium BAC end sequences (BES) were used for comparative analysis against the 12 rice pseudomolecules. The analysis revealed that approximately 26.4% of BES have significant matches with the rice genome and 82.4% of the matches were homologous to known genes. Further analysis of paired-end BES and approximately 1.0 Mb sequences from nine selected BACs proved to be useful in revealing conserved regions and regions that have undergone considerable genomic changes. Differential gene amplification, insertions/deletions and inversions appeared to be the common evolutionary events that caused variations of microcolinearity at different orthologous genomic regions. It was found that approximately 17% of genes in the two genomes are not colinear in the orthologous regions. Analysis of BAC sequences also revealed higher gene density (approximately 9 kb/gene) and lower repeat DNA content (approximately 13.1%) in Brachypodium when compared to the orthologous rice regions, consistent with the smaller size of the Brachypodium genome. The 119 annotated Brachypodium genes were BLASTN compared against the wheat EST database and deletion bin mapped wheat ESTs. About 77% of the genes retrieved significant matches in the EST database, while 9.2% matched to the bin mapped ESTs. In some cases, genes in single Brachypodium BACs matched to multiple ESTs that were mapped to the same deletion bins, suggesting that the Brachypodium genome will be useful for ordering wheat ESTs within the deletion bins and developing specific markers at targeted regions in the wheat genome."

Both vectors carried selection cassettes with bar or nptII driven by different promoters. Two cultivars of wheat, Kontesa and Torka, and one cultivar of triticale, Wanad, were tested. The transformation rates for the wheat cultivars ranged from 0.00 to 3.58% and from 0.00 to 6.79% for triticale. The best values for wheat were 3.58% for Kontesa and 3.14% for Torka, and these were obtained after transformation with the pGreen vector carrying the nptII selection gene under the control of 35S promoter. In the case of the bar selection system, the best transformation rates were, respectively, 1.46 and 1.79%. Such rates were obtained when the 35S::bar cassette was carried by the pCAMBIA vector; they were significantly lower with the pGreen vector. The triticale cultivar Wanad had its highest transformation rate after transformation with nptII driven by 35S in pCAMBIA. The bar selection system for the same triticale cultivar was better when the gene was driven by nos and the selection cassette was carried by pGreen. The integration of the transgenes was confirmed with at least three pairs of specific starters amplifying the fragments of nptII, bar, or gus. The expression of selection genes, measured by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in relation to the actin gene, was low, ranging from 0.00 to 0.63 for nptII and from 0.00 to 0.33 for bar. The highest relative transcript accumulation was observed for nptII driven by 35S and expressed in Kontesa that had been transformed with pGreen."

"21849815","abstracttext","Two wheat varieties HD-29 (resistant, R) and WH-542 (susceptible, S) were pretreated with jasmonic acid (JA) or jasmonate and then artificially inoculated with sporidial suspension of Tilletia indica to study its influence in reducing Karnal bunt (KB) infection by regulating cystatin gene expression. JA was found to improve the plant defense against KB as its exogenous application resulted in decrease in coefficient of infection (CI) in both susceptible and resistant varieties following pathogen inoculation. Transcript profiling of wheat cystatin genes at different days after inoculation (DAI) showed that JA pretreatment positively induced cystatin gene expression in both varieties with greater induction of expression in resistant variety than the susceptible one (P< 0.05). Different temporal expression of three wheat cystatin genes, WC2, WC3 and WCMD was observed with their increased expression at 1DAI in the boot emergence stage which is most susceptible to KB and then slowly declined gradually at 3, 7 and 15 DAI in both the varieties. Except WC2, higher expression of other two cystatins viz. WC3 and WCMD at 1DAI showed higher response (P< 0.05) to KB pathogenesis at the disease-prone boot emergence stage as also evident by decrease of CI in both varieties. The results of determination of specific activity of cystatin by inhibitor assay were found to be consistent with those of transcript profiling. These findings suggest that jasmonic acid (JA) may act as a potential activator of induced resistance against Karnal bunt of wheat by upregulating cystatin gene expression."

"22031834","abstracttext","Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) is a single-stranded RNA virus with three genome components designated alpha, beta, and gamma. BSMV vectors have previously been shown to be efficient virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) vehicles in barley and wheat and have provided important information about host genes functioning during pathogenesis as well as various aspects of genes functioning in development. To permit more effective use of BSMV VIGS for functional genomics experiments, we have developed an Agrobacterium delivery system for BSMV and have coupled this with a ligation independent cloning (LIC) strategy to mediate efficient cloning of host genes. Infiltrated Nicotiana benthamiana leaves provided excellent sources of virus for secondary BSMV infections and VIGS in cereals. The Agro/LIC BSMV VIGS vectors were able to function in high efficiency down regulation of phytoene desaturase (PDS), magnesium chelatase subunit H (ChlH), and plastid transketolase (TK) gene silencing in N. benthamiana and in the monocots, wheat, barley, and the model grass, Brachypodium distachyon. Suppression of an Arabidopsis orthologue cloned from wheat (TaPMR5) also interfered with wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) infections in a manner similar to that of the A. thaliana PMR5 loss-of-function allele. These results imply that the PMR5 gene has maintained similar functions across monocot and dicot families. Our BSMV VIGS system provides substantial advantages in expense, cloning efficiency, ease of manipulation and ability to apply VIGS for high throughput genomics studies."
"22483046","articletitle","The feruloyl esterase gene family of Fusarium graminearum is differentially regulated by aromatic compounds and hosts."
"22483046","abstracttext","Feruloyl esterases can liberate ferulic acid (FA) from plant cell wall polymers. They are expressed by plant pathogenic fungi and could play a role in pathogenicity, although this question has not been addressed yet. The fungus Fusarium graminearum is the principal causal agent of fusarium head blight (FHB) and gibberella ear rot (GER), major diseases of wheat, barley, and maize in all temperate regions of the world. The F. graminearum genome contains seven genes with strong homology to feruloyl esterase (FAE) sequences. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these included three type B, three type C, and one type D FAE genes. Expression profiling of the seven FAE genes showed complex regulation patterns unique to each gene. In F. graminearum-infected plant tissues, the FAE genes exhibited host-specific gene expression. On wheat, FAEB1 and FAED1 were strongly expressed while FAEB2, FAEB3, and FAEC1 were expressed at more modest levels. On maize, only FAEB3, FAEC1, and FAED1 were expressed and at low levels. When growing F. graminearum in liquid culture, only FAEB1 and FAEC1 were expressed. Both genes were induced by a small group of related aromatic compounds including FA, caffeic acid, and p-coumaric acid. FAEB1 was induced by xylose, while repressed by glucose and galactose. FAEC1 was constitutively expressed at low levels in the presence of those sugars. Expression of the other five FAE genes was not detected in the culture conditions used. To determine if FAE genes were important for pathogenicity of F. graminearum, mutant strains inactivated for faeB1∆, faeD1∆ or both genes were constructed and tested on wheat plants. No statistically significant change in pathogenicity and no compensatory expression of the other FAE genes were observed in the fae gene mutants. Our results show that FAEB1 and FAED1 are not required for pathogenicity of F. graminearum on wheat."

"20725713","abstracttext","Stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & E. Henn.) has re-emerged as a threat to wheat production with the evolution of new pathogen races, namely TTKSK (Ug99) and its variants, in Africa. Deployment of resistant wheat cultivars has provided long-term control of stem rust. Identification of new resistance genes will contribute to future cultivars with broad resistance to stem rust. The related Canadian cultivars Peace and AC Cadillac show resistance to Ug99 at the seedling stage and in the field. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the inheritance and genetically map resistance to Ug99 in these two cultivars. Two populations were produced, an F(2:3) population from LMPG/AC Cadillac and a doubled haploid (DH) population from RL6071/Peace. Both populations showed segregation at the seedling stage for a single stem rust resistance (Sr) gene, temporarily named SrCad. SrCad was mapped to chromosome 6DS in both populations with microsatellite markers and a marker (FSD_RSA) that is tightly linked to the common bunt resistance gene Bt10. FSD_RSA was the closest marker to SrCad (≈ 1.6 cM). Evaluation of the RL6071/Peace DH population and a second DH population, AC Karma/87E03-S2B1, in Kenya showed that the combination of SrCad and leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 provided a high level of resistance to Ug99-type races in the field, whereas in the absence of Lr34 SrCad conferred moderate resistance. A survey confirmed that SrCad is the basis for all of the seedling resistance to Ug99 in Canadian wheat cultivars. While further study is needed to determine the relationship between SrCad and other Sr genes on chromosome 6DS, SrCad represents a valuable genetic resource for producing stem rust resistant wheat cultivars."
"22176579","articletitle","Transgenic Pm3 multilines of wheat show increased powdery mildew resistance in the field."
"22176579","abstracttext","Resistance (R) genes protect plants very effectively from disease, but many of them are rapidly overcome when present in widely grown cultivars. To overcome this lack of durability, strategies that increase host resistance diversity have been proposed. Among them is the use of multilines composed of near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing different disease resistance genes. In contrast to classical R-gene introgression by recurrent backcrossing, a transgenic approach allows the development of lines with identical genetic background, differing only in a single R gene. We have used alleles of the resistance locus Pm3 in wheat, conferring race-specific resistance to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici), to develop transgenic wheat lines overexpressing Pm3a, Pm3c, Pm3d, Pm3f or Pm3g. In field experiments, all tested transgenic lines were significantly more resistant than their respective nontransformed sister lines. The resistance level of the transgenic Pm3 lines was determined mainly by the frequency of virulence to the particular Pm3 allele in the powdery mildew population, Pm3 expression levels and most likely also allele-specific properties. We created six two-way multilines by mixing seeds of the parental line Bobwhite and transgenic Pm3a, Pm3b and Pm3d lines. The Pm3 multilines were more resistant than their components when tested in the field. This demonstrates that the difference in a single R gene is sufficient to cause host-diversity effects and that multilines of transgenic Pm3 wheat lines represent a promising strategy for an effective and sustainable use of Pm3 alleles."

"23292293","abstracttext","Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks. & Henn.) is a major disease affecting durum wheat production. The Lr14a-resistant gene present in the durum wheat cv. Creso and its derivative cv. Colosseo is one of the best characterized leaf-rust resistance sources deployed in durum wheat breeding. Lr14a has been mapped close to the simple sequence repeat markers gwm146, gwm344 and wmc10 in the distal portion of the chromosome arm 7BL, a gene-dense region. The objectives of this study were: (1) to enrich the Lr14a region with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and high-resolution melting (HRM)-based markers developed from conserved ortholog set (COS) genes and from sequenced Diversity Array Technology (DArT(®)) markers; (2) to further investigate the gene content and colinearity of this region with the Brachypodium and rice genomes. Ten new COS-SNP and five HRM markers were mapped within an 8.0 cM interval spanning Lr14a. Two HRM markers pinpointed the locus in an interval of <1.0 cM and eight COS-SNPs were mapped 2.1-4.1 cM distal to Lr14a. Each marker was tested for its capacity to predict the state of Lr14a alleles (in particular, Lr14-Creso associated to resistance) in a panel of durum wheat elite germplasm including 164 accessions. Two of the most informative markers were converted into KASPar(®) markers. Single assay markers ubw14 and wPt-4038-HRM designed for agarose gel electrophoresis/KASPar(®) assays and high-resolution melting analysis, respectively, as well as the double-marker combinations ubw14/ubw18, ubw14/ubw35 and wPt-4038-HRM-ubw35 will be useful for germplasm haplotyping and for molecular-assisted breeding."

"23177204","abstracttext","The aim of the investigation is to determine the effect of He-Ne laser pretreatment of wheat seeds on the resistance of seedlings to cadmium stress. Changes in physiological, biochemical and molecular characters were measured. Our results showed that 150 μM Cd treatment significantly reduced plant height, root length, shoot fresh weight, shoot dry weight, root fresh weight, root dry weight, ascorbate acid (AsA) and glutathione (GSH) concentration, the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and gene expression levels of SOD, APX, enhanced the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and the rate of superoxide radical (O(2)(•-)) generation in the wheat seedlings when compared with the control. However, seeds with He-Ne laser pretreatment 5 min conferred tolerance to cadmium stress in wheat seedlings by decreasing the concentration of MDA and H(2)O(2), the rate of O(2)(•-) generation and increasing the gene expression levels of SOD, POD, APX, the activities of SOD, POD, CAT, APX and AsA and GSH concentration. These results suggest that those changes in MDA, O(2)(•-), H(2)O(2), anti-oxidative enzymes, gene expression level and anti-oxidative compounds are responsible for the increase in cadmium stress resistance observed in the experiments. The results also showed that the laser had a positive physiological effect on the growth of cadmium stressed seedlings. This is the first investigation reporting the use of He-Ne laser pretreatment to enhance of wheat seedlings tolerance to cadmium stress."

"23881396","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most serious diseases of wheat; therefore, exploring effective resistance-related genes is critical for breeding and studying resistance mechanisms. However, only a few stripe rust resistance genes and defence-related genes have been cloned. Moreover, transgenic wheat with enhanced stripe rust resistance has rarely been reported. Receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are known to be involved in defence and developmental pathways. In this research, a novel RLP gene TaRLP1.1 was characterized as an important stripe rust defence gene. TaRLP1.1 was screened by GeneChip and was found to be induced by Pst specifically in the resistant variety. Knock down of TaRLP1.1 in the stripe rust-resistant plants resulted in increased susceptibility to Pst, and phenolic autofluorogen accumulation at the pathogen-host interaction sites, usually correlated with the hypersensitive response, was decreased dramatically. However, when the TaRLP1.1 gene was transformed into the susceptible wheat variety Yangmai158, the transgenic plants showed highly increased resistance to Pst, and the hypersensitive response was enhanced at the infection sites. Meanwhile, the expression of pathogenesis-related genes decreased in the TaRLP1.1-silenced plants and increased in the TaRLP1.1-overexpressing plants. Thus, it was proposed that TaRLP1.1 greatly contributed to the hypersensitive response during the pathogen-host interaction. Along with the functional analysis, an evolutionary study of the TaRLP1 family was performed. Characterization of TaRLP1.1 may facilitate breeding for stripe rust resistance and better understanding of the evolution of the RLP genes in wheat."

"24081822","abstracttext","Wheat-Dasypyrum villosum translocated chromosomes T6V#2S•6AL and T6V#4S•6DL are known to confer excellent resistance to wheat powdery mildew (PM). However, it is difficult to distinguish the two sources of PM resistance genes through multi-pathotype testing because to date no virulence for them has been found. To reveal the relationship between the PM resistance genes from the two translocations, the sequence of the Stpk-V gene, a key member of powdery mildew resistance locus Pm21, was used as a reference to isolate homologous genes from a D. villosum accession No.1026 and its derivatives 6V#4(6D) disomic substitution (DS) line RW15 and T6V#4S•6DL translocation line Pm97033. Two genes Stpk-V2 and Stpk-V3 were cloned from No.1026. Sequence alignment showed that Stpk-V2 and Stpk-V3 shared 98.2 % and 96.2 % of their DNA and 99.3 % and 100 % of their amino acids in identity with Stpk-V. Compared with Stpk-V, a 22-bp direct sequence repeat and a miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) were found in the intron 4 of Stpk-V2 and Stpk-V3, respectively. However, Stpk-V2 was not present in DS line RW15 and translocation line Pm97033 based on the PCR result, indicating that Stpk-V2 did not contribute to the PM resistance of RW15 and Pm97033. In the promoter region, a 78-bp insertion was found not only in Stpk-V2 and Stpk-V3, but also in its orthologous gene Stpk-A of wheat. In addition, there was a 17 bp/8 bp deletion/insertion in the putative promoter of Stpk-V3 in comparison with that of Stpk-V/Stpk-V2. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that the expression levels of Stpk-V and Stpk-V3 genes in the translocation lines were induced by the pathogen, but Stpk-V had a higher expression level than Stpk-V3 at 12 h after inoculation with Bgt. The diversity of Stpk-V gene will help to explore new resistance genes to PM in D. villosum for wheat breeding."

"26150199","abstracttext","Plants respond to abiotic stresses by changes in gene regulation, including stress-inducible expression of transcriptional activators and repressors. One of the best characterized families of drought-related transcription factors are dehydration-responsive element binding (DREB) proteins, known as C-repeat binding factors (CBF). The wheat DREB/CBF gene TaRAP2.1L was isolated from drought-affected tissues using a dehydration-responsive element (DRE) as bait in a yeast one-hybrid screen. TaRAP2.1L is induced by elevated abscisic acid, drought and cold. A C-terminal ethylene responsive factor-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif, known to be responsible for active repression of target genes, was identified in the TaRAP2.1L protein. It was found that TaRAP2.1L has a unique selectivity of DNA-binding, which differs from that of DREB activators. This binding selectivity remains unchanged in a TaRAP2.1L variant with an inactivated EAR motif (TaRAP2.1Lmut). To study the role of the TaRAP2.1L repressor activity associated with the EAR motif in planta, transgenic wheat overexpressing native or mutated TaRAP2.1L was generated. Overexpression of TaRAP2.1L under constitutive and stress-inducible promoters in transgenic wheat and barley led to dwarfism and decreased frost tolerance. By contrast, constitutive overexpression of the TaRAP2.1Lmut gene had little or no negative influence on wheat development or grain yield. Transgenic lines with the TaRAP2.1Lmut transgene had an enhanced ability to survive frost and drought. The improved stress tolerance is attributed to up-regulation of several stress-related genes known to be downstream genes of DREB/CBF activators."

"26010918","abstracttext","LHY (late elongated hypocotyl) is an important gene that regulates and controls biological rhythms in plants. Additionally, LHY is highly expressed in the SSH (suppression subtractive hybridization) cDNA library-induced stripe rust pathogen (CYR32) in our previous research. To identify the function of the LHY gene in disease resistance against stripe rust, we used RACE-PCR technology to clone TaLHY in the wheat variety Chuannong19. The cDNA of TaLHY is 3085 bp long with an open reading frame of 1947 bp. TaLHY is speculated to encode a 70.3 kDa protein of 648 amino acids , which has one typical plant MYB-DNA binding domain; additionally, phylogenetic tree shows that TaLHY has the highest homology with LHY of Brachypodium distachyon(BdLHY-like). Quantitative fluorescence PCR indicates that TaLHY has higher expression in the leaf, ear and stem of wheat but lower expression in the root. Infestation of CYR32 can result in up-regulated expression of TaLHY, peaking at 72 h. Using VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing) technology to disease-resistant wheat in the fourth leaf stage, plants with silenced TaLHY cannot complete their heading stage. Through the compatible interaction with the stripe rust physiological race CYR32, Chuannong 19 loses its immune capability toward the stripe rust pathogen, indicating that TaLHY may regulate and participate in the heading of wheat, as well as the defense responses against stripe rust infection."

"25819570","abstracttext","Rhizoremediation, the use of the plant rhizosphere and associated microorganisms represents a promising method for the clean up of soils contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) including phenanthrene and pyrene, two model PAHs. Although numerous studies have been published reporting the degradation of phenanthrene and pyrene, very few evaluate the microbial basis of the rhizoremediation process through the application of molecular tools. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of wheat on the degradation of two model PAHs (alone or in combination) and also on soil bacterial, fungal and nidA gene (i.e. a key gene in the degradation of pyrene) communities. The addition of wheat plants led to a significant enhancement in the degradation of both phenanthrene and pyrene. In pyrene-contaminated soils, the degradation rate increased from 15% (65 mg/kg) and 18% (90 mg/kg) in unplanted soils to 65% (280 mg/kg) and 70% (350 mg/kg) in planted treatments while phenanthrene reduction was enhanced from 97% (394 mg/kg) and 87% (392 mg/kg) for unplanted soils to 100% (406 mg/kg) and 98% (441 mg/kg) in the presence of wheat. PCR-DGGE results showed that the plant root let to some changes in the bacterial and fungal communities; these variations did not reflect any change in hydrocarbon-degrading communities. However, plate counting, traditional MPN and MPN-qPCR of nidA gene revealed that the wheat rhizosphere led to an increase in the total microbial abundance including PAH degrading organisms and these increased activities resulted in enhanced degradation of phenanthrene and pyrene. This clearer insight into the mechanisms underpinning PAH degradation will enable better application of this environmentally friendly technique."

"26796533","abstracttext_key message","We identified a major QTL conferring race-nonspecific resistance and revealed its relationships with race-specific interactions in the wheat- Pyrenophora tritici-repentis pathosystem. Tan spot, caused by the fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), is a destructive disease of wheat worldwide. The disease system is known to include inverse gene-for-gene, race-specific interactions involving the recognition of fungal-produced necrotrophic effectors (NEs) by corresponding host sensitivity genes. However, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring race-nonspecific resistance have also been identified. In this work, we identified a major race-nonspecific resistance QTL and characterized its genetic relationships with the NE-host gene interactions Ptr ToxA-Tsn1 and Ptr ToxC-Tsc1 in a recombinant inbred wheat population derived from the cross between 'Louise' and 'Penawawa.' Both parental lines were sensitive to Ptr ToxA, but Penawawa and Louise were highly resistant and susceptible, respectively, to conidial inoculations of all races. Resistance was predominantly governed by a major race-nonspecific QTL on chromosome arm 3BL for resistance to all races. Another significant QTL was detected at the distal end of chromosome arm 1AS for resistance to the Ptr ToxC-producing isolates, which corresponded to the known location of the Tsc1 locus. The effects of the 3B and 1A QTLs were largely additive, and the 3B resistance QTL was epistatic to the Ptr ToxA-Tsn1 interaction. Resistance to race 2 in F1 plants was completely dominant; however, race 3-inoculated F1 plants were only moderately resistant because they developed chlorosis presumably due to the Ptr ToxC-Tsc1 interaction. This work provides further understanding of genetic resistance in the wheat-tan spot system as well as important guidance for tan spot resistance breeding."

"27539013","abstracttext_key message","Many deletions of the wheat Della ( Rht - B1 ) gene and its flanking regions were isolated in a simple phenotypic screen, and characterised by modified analysis of SNP hybridisation data and cytogenetics. In a dwarf wheat suppressor screen, many tall 'revertants' were isolated following mutagenesis of a severely dwarfed (Rht-B1c) hexaploid wheat. About 150 lines were identified as putative deletions of Rht-B1c, based on the PCR analysis. Southern blot hybridisation established that most of them lacked the Rht-B1 gene, but retained the homoeologues Rht-A1 and Rht-D1. PCR assays were developed for orthologues of two genes that flank Rht-1/Della in the genomes of the model species Brachypodium and rice. Deletion of the B-genome-specific homoeologues of these two genes was confirmed in the Rht-B1 deletion lines, indicating loss of more than a single gene. SNP chip hybridisation analysis established the extents of deletion in these lines. Based on the synteny with Brachypodium chromosomes 1 and 4 g, and rice chromosomes 3g and 11g, notional deletion maps were established. The deletions ranged from interstitial deletions of 4BS through to loss of all 4BS markers. There were also instances, where all 4BS and 4BL markers were lost, and these lines had poor fertility and narrow stems and leaves. Cytogenetic studies on selected lines confirmed the loss of portions of 4BS in lines that lacked most or all 4BS markers. They also confirmed that lines lacking both 4BS and 4BL markers were nullisomics for 4B. These nested deletion lines share a common genetic background and will have applications in assigning markers to regions of 4BS as well as to 4BL. The potential for this type of analysis in other regions of the wheat genome is discussed."

"27544524","abstracttext_key message","A gene for Ug99 resistance from wheat landrace CItr 4311 was detected on the long arm of chromosome 2B. Wheat landrace CItr 4311 has seedling resistance to stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK and field resistance to the Ug99 race group. Parents, F 1 seedlings, 121 doubled haploid (DH) lines, and 124 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from a cross between CItr 4311 and the susceptible line LMPG-6 were evaluated for seedling resistance to race TTKSK. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that a single dominant gene in CItr 4311 conditioned the TTKSK resistance. The 90 K wheat iSelect SNP platform was used to genotype parents and the DH population. The seedling resistance locus was mapped to the chromosome arm 2BL. Parents and the DH population were evaluated for field resistance in Kenya. One major QTL for the field resistance was consistently detected in the same region on 2BL as the seedling resistance. Using KASP assays, five linked SNP markers were used to verify the result in the 124 RIL, 35 wheat accessions, 46 DH lines from the LMPG-6/PI 165194 cross and F 1 seedlings, and susceptible bulks derived from crosses between six resistant landraces with LMPG-6. Race specificity, mapping results, and haplotype similarity with lines with Sr9h (Gabo 56, Timstein, and PI 670015), support the hypothesis that the Sr gene in CItr 4311 and the landraces is Sr9h. The KASP assays developed in this study will be useful for pyramiding the TTKSK resistance from CItr 4311 with other Sr genes effective against Ug99."

"29434615","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by the fungus Fusarium graminearum , represents one of the major wheat diseases worldwide, determining severe yield losses and reduction of grain quality due to the accumulation of mycotoxins. The molecular response associated with the wheat 2DL FHB resistance QTL was mined through a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of the early response to F. graminearum infection, at 3 days post-inoculation, in spikelets and rachis. The analyses were conducted on two near isogenic lines (NILs) differing for the presence of the 2DL QTL (2-2618, resistant 2DL+ and 2-2890, susceptible null). The general response to fungal infection in terms of mRNAs accumulation trend was similar in both NILs, even though involving an higher number of DEGs in the susceptible NIL, and included down-regulation of the primary and energy metabolism, up-regulation of enzymes implicated in lignin and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, activation of hormons biosynthesis and signal transduction pathways and genes involved in redox homeostasis and transcriptional regulation. The search for candidate genes with expression profiles associated with the 2DL QTL for FHB resistance led to the discovery of processes differentially modulated in the R and S NILs related to cell wall metabolism, sugar and JA signaling, signal reception and transduction, regulation of the redox status and transcription factors. Wheat FHB response-related miRNAs differentially regulated were also identified as putatively implicated in the superoxide dismutase activities and affecting genes regulating responses to biotic/abiotic stresses and auxin signaling. Altered gene expression was also observed for fungal non-codingRNAs. The putative targets of two of these were represented by the wheat gene WIR1A , involved in resistance response, and a gene encoding a jacalin-related lectin protein, which participate in biotic and abiotic stress response, supporting the presence of a cross-talk between the plant and the fungus."

"29560515","abstracttext_key message","A new adult plant stripe rust resistance gene, Yr80, was identified in a common wheat landrace Aus27284. Linked markers were developed and validated for their utility in marker-assisted selection. Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is among the most important constraints to global wheat production. The identification and characterisation of new sources of host plant resistance enrich the gene pool and underpin deployment of resistance gene pyramids in new cultivars. Aus27284 exhibited resistance at the adult plant stage against predominant Pst pathotypes and was crossed with a susceptible genotype Avocet S. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population comprising 121 lines was developed and tested in the field at three locations in 2016 and two in 2017 crop seasons. Monogenic segregation for adult plant stripe rust response was observed among the Aus27284/Avocet S RIL population and the underlying locus was temporarily designated YrAW11. Bulked-segregant analysis using the Infinium iSelect 90K SNP wheat array placed YrAW11 in chromosome 3B. Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) primers were designed for the linked SNPs and YrAW11 was flanked by KASP_65624 and KASP_53292 (3 cM) proximally and KASP_53113 (4.9 cM) distally. A partial linkage map of the genomic region carrying YrAW11 comprised nine KASP and two SSR markers. The physical position of KASP markers in the pseudomolecule of chromosome 3B placed YrAW11 in the long arm and the location of markers gwm108 and gwm376 in the deletion bin 3BL2-0.22 supported this conclusion. As no other stripe rust resistance locus has been reported in chromosome 3BL, YrAW11 was formally designated Yr80.

To map quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying the high-level, durable resistance, 156 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from cross Avocet S × Madsen were phenotyped with selected races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici in the greenhouse seedling tests, and in naturally infected fields during 2015-2017. The RILs were genotyped by SSR and SNP markers from genotyping by sequencing and the 90 K wheat SNP chip. Three QTL for all-stage resistance were mapped on chromosomes 1AS, 1BS and 2AS, and two QTL for high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance were mapped on 3BS and 6BS. The most effective QTL on 2AS, explaining 8.97-23.10% of the phenotypic variation in seedling tests and 8.60-71.23% in field tests, contained Yr17 for all-stage resistance and an additional gene for HTAP resistance. The 6BS QTL, detected in all field tests, was identified as Yr78. The 1AS QTL, conferring all-stage resistance, was identified as a new gene, which explained 20.45 and 30.23% of variation in resistance to races PSTv-37 and PSTv-40, respectively, and contributed significantly to field resistance at Pullman in 2015-2017, but was not detected at Mount Vernon. The interactions among QTL were mostly additive, and RILs with all five QTL had the highest level of resistance in the field, similar to Madsen. Genotyping 148 US Pacific Northwest wheat cultivars with markers for the 1AS, 2AS and 6BS QTL validated the genes and markers, and indicated their usefulness for marker-assisted selection."

"31079164","abstracttext_key message","Wild emmer allele of GNI-A1 ease competition among developing grains through the suppression of floret fertility and increase grain weight in tetraploid wheat. Grain yield is a highly polygenic trait determined by the number of grains per unit area, as well as by grain weight. In wheat, grain number and grain weight are usually negatively correlated. Yet, the genetic basis underlying trade-off between the two is mostly unknown. Here, we fine-mapped a grain weight QTL using wild emmer introgressions in a durum wheat background and showed that grain weight is associated with the GNI-A1 gene, a regulator of floret fertility. In-depth characterization of grain number and grain weight indicated that suppression of distal florets by the wild emmer GNI-A1 allele increases weight of proximal grains in basal and central spikelets due to alteration in assimilate distribution. Re-sequencing of GNI-A1 in tetraploid wheat demonstrated the rich allelic repertoire of the wild emmer gene pool, including a rare allele which was present in two gene copies and contained a nonsynonymous mutation in the C-terminus of the protein. Using an F 2 population generated from a cross between wild emmer accessions Zavitan, which carries the rare allele, and TTD140, we demonstrated that this unique polymorphism is associated with grain weight, independent of grain number. Moreover, we showed, for the first time, that GNI-A1 proteins are transcriptional activators and that selection targeted compromised activity of the protein. Our findings expand the knowledge of the genetic basis underlying trade-off between key yield components and may contribute to breeding efforts for enhanced grain yield."

"32380773","abstracttext","Wheat grain development after anthesis is an important biological process, in which major components of seeds are synthesised, and these components are further required for germination and seed vigour. We have made a comparative RNA-Seq analysis between hexaploid wheat and its individual diploid progenitors to know the major differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved during grain development. Two libraries from each species were generated with an average of 55.63, 55.23, 68.13, and 103.81 million reads, resulting in 79.3K, 113.7K, 90.6K, and 121.3K numbers of transcripts in AA, BB, DD, and AABBDD genome species respectively. Number of expressed genes in hexaploid wheat was not proportional to its genome size, but marginally higher than that of its diploid progenitors. However, to capture all the transcripts in hexaploid wheat, sufficiently higher number of reads was required. Functional analysis of DEGs, in all the three comparisons, showed their predominance in three major classes of genes during grain development, i.e., nutrient reservoirs, carbohydrate metabolism, and defence proteins; some of them were subsequently validated through real time quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Further, developmental stage-specific gene expression showed most of the defence protein genes expressed during initial developmental stages in hexaploid contrary to the diploids at later stages. Genes related to carbohydrates anabolism expressed during early stages, whereas catabolism genes expressed at later stages in all the species. However, no trend was observed in case of different nutrient reservoirs gene expression. This data could be used to study the comparative gene expression among the three diploid species and homeologue-specific expression in hexaploid."

Line W3757 is a 6Ae#3 (6D) substitution line in which the Thinopyrum ponticum chromosomes carry SrB. Crosses were made between W3757 and a T6AS·6AL-6Ae#1 recombinant line named WA-5 carrying the stem rust resistance gene Sr26 on a chromosome segment from another accession of Th. ponticum. The 6Ae#1 and 6Ae#3 chromosomes had previously been shown to pair at meiosis and were polymorphic for the distally located RFLP probes BCD001 and MWG798. A recombinant plant (Type A) was identified carrying a distal chromosome segment from the 6Ae#3 chromosome and a sub-terminal segment from the 6Ae#1 chromosome. Rust tests on the recombinant Type A showed the infection type for SrB. Segregation and linkage data combined with genomic in situ hybridization studies demonstrated that SrB had been transferred to wheat chromosome arm 6AL by recombination between the Thinopyrum chromosome segments. A recombinant positive for the 6Ae#1-6Ae#3 chromosome showed enhanced stem rust resistance compared to the 6Ae#3 addition line in repeated rust tests. A diagnostic PCR-based marker was developed for the 6Ae#3 chromosome segment on the Type A recombinant carrying SrB that distinguishes it from the Sr26-containing segment. A stem rust resistant line which combines SrB with Sr26 would be a great addition to the pool of resistant germplasm for wheat breeders to achieve more durable and effective control of stem rust because virulence has not been found for either of these two genes."

"32361896","abstracttext","Auxin affects many aspects of plant growth and development by regulating the expression of auxin-responsive genes. As one of the three major auxin-responsive families the Gretchen Hagen3 (GH3) gene family maintains hormonal homeostasis by conjugating excess indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), salicylic acid (SA), and jasmonic acid (JA) to amino acids during hormone and stress-related signaling. Although some work has been carried out the functions of wheat GH3 (TaGH3) family genes in response to abiotic stresses (including salt stress and osmotic stress) are largely unknown. Access to the complete wheat genome sequence permits genome-wide studies on TaGH3s. We performed a systematic identification of the TaGH3 gene family at the genome level and detected 36 members on 14 wheat chromosomes. Many of the genes were segmentally duplicated and Ka/Ks and inter-species synthetic analyses indicated that polyploidization was the contributor to the increased number of TaGH3 members. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that TaGH3 proteins could divided into three major categories (TaGH3-I, TaGH3-II, and TaGH3-III). Diversified cis-elements in the promoters of TaGH3 genes were predicted as essential players in regulating TaGH3 expression patterns. Gene structure and motif analyses indicated that most TaGH3 genes have relatively conserved exon/intron arrangements and motif compositions. Analysis of multiple transcriptome data sets indicated that many TaGH3 genes are responsive to biological and abiotic stresses and possibly have important functions in stress response. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that TaGH3s were induced by salt and osmotic stresses. Customized annotation results revealed that TaGH3s were widely involved in phytohormone response, defense, growth and development, and metabolism. Overall, our work provides a comprehensive insight into the TaGH3 family members, and a basis for the further study of their biological functions in wheat."
"30673523","articletitle","Genetic Relationship of Stripe Rust Resistance Genes Yr34 and Yr48 in Wheat and Identification of Linked KASP Markers."
"30673523","abstracttext","The Australian continent was free from wheat stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici until exotic incursions occurred in 1979 and 2002. The 2002 incursion enabled the identification of a new stripe rust resistance gene (Yr34) in the advanced breeding line WAWHT2046. In this study, we developed and validated markers closely linked with Yr34, which is located in the distal region in the long arm of chromosome 5A. Four kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) and three sequence-tagged site (STS) markers derived from the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium RefSeq v1.0 scaffold-77836 cosegregated with Yr34. Markers sun711, sun712, sun725, sunKASP_109, and sunKASP_112 were shown to be suitable for marker-assisted selection in a validation panel of 71 Australian spring wheat genotypes, with the exception of cultivar Orion that carried the Yr34-linked alleles for sunKASP_109 and sunKASP_112. Markers previously reported to be linked with adult plant stripe rust resistance gene Yr48 also cosegregated with Yr34. Wheat genotypes carrying Yr34 and Yr48 produced identical haplotypes for the Yr34-linked markers identified in this study and those previously reported to be linked with Yr48. Phenotypic testing of genotypes carrying Yr34 and Yr48 showed that both genes conferred similar seedling responses to pre-2002 and post-2002 P. striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotypes. Further testing of 600 F 2 plants from a cross between WAWHT2046 and RIL143 (Yr48) with P. striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotype 134 E16A+Yr17+Yr27+ failed to reveal any susceptible segregants. Our results strongly suggest that Yr34 and Yr48 are the same gene, and that Yr48 should be considered a synonym of Yr34."

However, gene transfer rates are low for this species and relatively few species-specific molecular markers are available."
"31823771","abstracttext_results","The wheat-tetraploid Th. elongatum line K17-841-1 derived from a cross between a hexaploid Trititrigia and Sichuan wheat cultivars was characterized based on sequential genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridizations and simple sequence repeat markers. We revealed that K17-841-1 is a 1E (1D) chromosomal substitution line that is highly resistant to stripe rust pathogen strains prevalent in China. By comparing the sequences generated during genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), we obtained 597 specific fragments on the 1E chromosome of tetraploid Th. elongatum. A total of 235 primers were designed and 165 new Th. elongatum-specific markers were developed, with an efficiency of up to 70%. Marker validation analyses indicated that 25 specific markers can discriminate between the tetraploid Th. elongatum chromosomes and the chromosomes of other wheat-related species. An evaluation of the utility of these markers in a F 2 breeding population suggested these markers are linked to the stripe rust resistance gene on chromosome 1E. Furthermore, 28 markers are unique to diploid Th. elongatum, tetraploid Th. elongatum, or decaploid Thinopyrum ponticum, which carry the E genome. Finally, 48 and 74 markers revealed polymorphisms between Thinopyrum E-genome- containing species and Thinopyrum bessarabicum (E b ) and Pseudoroegneria libanotica (St), respectively."

"31732753","abstracttext_key message","An expressed HMW glutenin subunit Glu-Ay showed positive impacts on a range of wheat processing quality and yield traits. The grain protein compositions are significantly optimised for baking, resulting in a better breadmaking quality. The unique breadmaking properties of wheat flour are related to the quality and quantity of high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) present in the grain. In the current study, the silent 1Ay HMW-GS allele, present in most bread wheat cultivars, was replaced by the expressed 1Ay21* allele, which was introgressed into Australian bread wheat cultivar Lincoln by a backcrossing and selfing scheme. Stability of gene expression and the effect of the introgressed 1Ay21* subunit on protein composition, agronomic traits, flour functionality, and breadmaking quality were studied using BC4F5 grain grown in glasshouse and field. Field phenotyping and grain quality testing showed that the 1Ay21* gene conferred significant improvements to a range of traits, including an increase in grain protein content by up to 9%, UPP% by up to 24%, bread volume by up to 28%. The glasshouse experiment and one of the field trials showed positive 1Ay21* effects on yield, while one field trial showed one significant effects. This indicates that expression of the 1Ay21* gene has the potential of simultaneously increasing protein content and grain yield under certain environment. The qualitative improvements of the grain also led to a reduction of the energy required during the baking process in addition to the significant positive effects on bread quality."

"31494680","abstracttext_key message","Two stem rust resistance genes identified on chromosome arms 2BL and 6AL of the cultivated emmer wheat accession PI 193883 can be used for protecting modern varieties against Ug99 strains. The wheat research community consistently strives to identify new genes that confer resistance to stem rust caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks & E. Henn (Pgt). In the current study, our objective was to identify and genetically characterize the stem rust resistance derived from the cultivated emmer accession PI 193883. A recombinant inbred line population developed from a cross between the susceptible durum wheat line Rusty and PI 193883 was genotyped and evaluated for reaction to Pgt races TTKSK, TRTTF, and TMLKC. Two QTLs conferring resistance were identified on chromosome arms 2BL (QSr.fcu-2B) and 6AL (QSr.fcu-6A). The stem rust resistance gene (Sr883-2B) underlying QSr.fcu-2B was recessive, and based on its physical location it is located proximal to the Sr9 region. QSr.fcu-6A was located in the Sr13 region, but PI 193883 is known to carry the susceptible haplotype S4 for Sr13, indicating that the gene underlying QSr.fcu-6A (Sr883-6A) is likely a new allele of Sr13 or a gene residing close to Sr13. Three IWGSC scaffold-based simple sequence repeat (SSR) and two SNP-based semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR (STARP) markers were developed for the Sr883-2B region, and one STARP marker was developed for Sr883-6A. Sr883-2B was epistatic to Sr883-6A for reaction to TTKSK and TRTTF, and the two genes had additive effects for TMLKC. These two genes and the markers developed in this research provide additional resources and tools for the improvement in stem rust resistance in durum and common wheat breeding programs."

"31240345","abstracttext_key message","Two major dwarf bunt resistance QTLs were mapped to a known Bt9 locus and a novel locus. The associated KASP markers were developed and validated in other two populations. Dwarf bunt (DB), caused by Tilletia controversa J.G. Kühn, and common bunt (CB), caused by T. caries and T. foetida, are two destructive diseases that reduce grain yield and quality in wheat. Breeding for bunt-resistant cultivars is important in many wheat production areas, especially where organic wheat is grown. However, few molecular markers have been used in selection of bunt resistance. In the present study, a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from the bunt-resistant line 'IDO835' and the susceptible cultivar 'Moreland' was evaluated for DB resistance in a field nursery in Logan, Utah, for four growing seasons. The population was genotyped with the Illumina 90 K SNP iSelect marker platform. Two major QTLs were consistently identified on chromosomes 6DL (Q.DB.ui-6DL) and 7AL (Q.DB.ui-7AL), explaining up to 53% and 38% of the phenotypic variation, respectively. Comparative study suggested that Q.DB.ui-6DL was located in the same region as the CB resistance gene Bt9, and Q.DB.ui-7AL was located at a novel locus for bunt resistance. Based on Chinese Spring reference sequence and annotations (IWGSC RefSeq v1.1), both resistance QTLs were mapped to disease resistance gene-rich (NBS-LRR and kinase genes) regions. To validate the identified QTL and design user-friendly markers for MAS, five SNPs were converted to Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) markers and used to genotype two validation panels, including a DH population and a diverse winter wheat population from USDA-ARS National Small Grain Collection, as well as a Bt gene investigation panel, consisting of 15 bunt differential lines and 11 resistant lines."

"31172227","abstracttext","Allohexaploid (2n = 6x = 42) intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium), abbreviated IWG, is an outcrossing perennial grass belonging to the tertiary gene pool of wheat. Perenniality would be valuable option for grain production, but attempts to introgress this complex trait from wheat-Thinopyrum hybrids have not been commercially successful. Efforts to breed IWG itself as a dual-purpose forage and grain crop have demonstrated useful progress and applications, but grain yields are significantly less than wheat. Therefore, genetic and physical maps have been developed to accelerate domestication of IWG. Herein, these maps were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and candidate genes associated with IWG grain production traits in a family of 266 full-sib progenies derived from two heterozygous parents, M26 and M35. Transgressive segregation was observed for 17 traits related to seed size, shattering, threshing, inflorescence capacity, fertility, stem size, and flowering time. A total of 111 QTLs were detected in 36 different regions using 3826 genotype-by-sequence markers in 21 linkage groups. The most prominent QTL had a LOD score of 15 with synergistic effects of 29% and 22% over the family means for seed retention and percentage of naked seeds, respectively. Many QTLs aligned with one or more IWG gene models corresponding to 42 possible domestication orthogenes including the wheat Q and RHT genes. A cluster of seed-size and fertility QTLs showed possible alignment to a putative Z self-incompatibility gene, which could have detrimental grain-yield effects when genetic variability is low. These findings elucidate pathways and possible hurdles in the domestication of IWG."

"31357930","abstracttext_background","Good establishment is important for rapid leaf area development in wheat crops. Poor establishment results in fewer, later-emerging plants, reduced leaf area and tiller number. In addition, poorly established crops suffer from increased soil moisture loss through evaporation and greater competition from weeds while fewer spikes are produced which can reduce grain yield. By protecting the emerging first leaf, the coleoptile is critical for achieving good establishment, and its length and interaction with soil physical properties determine the ability of a cultivar to emerge from depth."
"31357930","abstracttext_results","Here we characterise a locus on chromosome 1AS, that increases coleoptile length in wheat, which we designate as Lcol-A1. We identified Lcol-A1 by bulked-segregant analysis and used a Halberd-derived population to fine map the gene to a 2 cM region, equivalent to 7 Mb on the IWGSC genome reference sequence of Chinese Spring (RefSeqv1.0). By sowing recently released cultivars and near-isogenic lines in the field at both conventional and deep sowing depths, we confirmed that Locl-A1 was associated with increased emergence from depth in the presence and absence of conventional dwarfing genes.

"33081330","abstracttext","Senescence is the final stage of leaf development which is accompanied by highly coordinated and complicated reprogramming of gene expression. Genetic manipulation of leaf senescence in major crops including wheat has been shown to be able to increase stress tolerance and grain yield. NAC(No apical meristem (NAM), ATAF1/2, and cup-shaped cotyledon (CUC)) transcription factors (TFs) play important roles in regulating gene expression changes during leaf senescence and in response to abiotic stresses. Here, we report the characterization of TaSNAC11-4B (Uniprot: A0A1D5XI64), a wheat NAC family member that acts as a functional homolog of AtNAP, a key regulator of leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. The expression of TaSNAC11-4B was up-regulated with the progression of leaf senescence, in response to abscisic acid (ABA) and drought treatments in wheat. Ectopic expression of TaSNAC11-4B in Arabidopsis promoted ROS accumulation and significantly accelerated age-dependent as well as drought- and ABA-induced leaf senescence. Results from transcriptional activity assays indicated that the TaSNAC11-4B protein displayed transcriptional activation activities that are dependent on its C terminus. Furthermore, qRT-PCR and dual-Luciferase assay results suggested that TaSNAC11-4B could positively regulate the expression of AtrbohD and AtrbohF , which encode catalytic subunits of the ROS-producing NADPH oxidase. Further analysis of TaSNAC11-4B in wheat senescence and the potential application of this gene in manipulating leaf senescence with the purpose of yield increase and stress tolerance is discussed."

"33244313","abstracttext","LuxR solos are common in plant-associated bacteria and increasingly recognized for playing important roles in plant-microbe interkingdom signaling. Unlike the LuxR-type transcriptional regulators of prototype LuxR/LuxI quorum sensing systems, luxR solos do not have a LuxI-type autoinducer synthase gene associated with them. LuxR solos in plant-pathogenic bacteria are important for virulence and in plant endosymbionts contribute to symbiosis. In the present study, we characterized an atypical LuxR solo, PcsR2, in the biological control species Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84 that is highly conserved among sequenced P. chlororaphi s strains. Unlike most LuxR solos in the plant-associated bacteria characterized to date, pcsR2 is not associated with a proline iminopeptidase gene and the protein has an atypical N-terminal binding domain. We created a pcsR2 deletion mutant and used quantitative RT-PCR to show that the expression of pcsR2 and genes in the operon immediately downstream was upregulated ∼10-fold when the wild type strain was grown on wheat roots compared to planktonic culture. PcsR2 was involved in upregulation. Using a GFP transcriptional reporter, we found that expression of pcsR2 responded specifically to root-derived substrates as compared to leaf-derived substrates but not to endogenous AHLs. Compared to the wild type, the mutant was impaired in the ability to utilize root carbon and nitrogen sources in wheat root macerate and to colonize wheat roots. Phenazine production and most biofilm traits previously shown to be correlated with phenazine production also were diminished in the mutant. Gene expression of several of the proteins in the phenazine regulatory network including PhzR, Pip (phenazine inducing protein) and RpeA/RpeB were reduced in the mutant, and overexpression of these genes in trans restored phenazine production in the mutant to wild-type levels, indicating PcsR2 affects the activity of the these regulatory genes upstream of RpeA/RpeB via an undetermined mechanism. Our results indicate PcsR2 upregulates the expression of the adjacent operon in response to unknown wheat root-derived signals and belongs to a novel subfamily of LuxR-type transcriptional regulators found in sequenced P. chlororaphis strains."

Puroindolines represent the molecular-genetic basis of grain texture. In addition, the puroindoline gene products have antimicrobial properties with potential role in plant defense. We document the complete coding sequences from the Triticum/Aegilops taxa, rye and barley including the A, D, C, H, M, N, R, S, and U genomes of the Triticeae. Maximum likelihood analyses performed on Bayesian phylogenetic trees showed distinct evolutionary patterns among Pina, Pinb, and Gsp-1. Positive diversifying selection appeared to drive the evolution of at least one of the three genes examined, suggesting that adaptive forces have operated at this locus. Results evidenced positive selection (omega > 4) at Pina and detected amino acid residues along the mature PIN-a protein with a high probability (>95%) of having evolved under adaptation. We hypothesized that positive selection at the Pina region is congruent with its role as a plant defense gene."

Recovery and viability of protoplasts after electroporation decreased with increasing voltages and capacitance while CAT activity increased up to a critical combination of voltage and capacitance beyond which the activity dramatically decreased. The optimal compromise between DNA uptake and expression versus cell survival was determined for D. carota and applied successfully to the other species. Maximum transient expression occurred 36 hours after electroporation of D. carota. The potential for using this procedure to rapidly assay gene function in dicot and monocot cells and application of this technique to obtain transformed cereals is discussed."

"21435244","abstracttext_results","To support gene discovery and gene model verification in the genome of the wheat leaf rust fungus, Puccinia triticina (Pt), we have generated Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) by sampling several life cycle stages. We focused on several spore stages and isolated haustorial structures from infected wheat, generating 17,684 ESTs. We produced sequences from both the sexual (pycniospores, aeciospores and teliospores) and asexual (germinated urediniospores) stages of the life cycle. From pycniospores and aeciospores, produced by infecting the alternate host, meadow rue (Thalictrum speciosissimum), 4,869 and 1,292 reads were generated, respectively. We generated 3,703 ESTs from teliospores produced on the senescent primary wheat host. Finally, we generated 6,817 reads from haustoria isolated from infected wheat as well as 1,003 sequences from germinated urediniospores. Along with 25,558 previously generated ESTs, we compiled a database of 13,328 non-redundant sequences (4,506 singlets and 8,822 contigs). Fungal genes were predicted using the EST version of the self-training GeneMarkS algorithm. To refine the EST database, we compared EST sequences by BLASTN to a set of 454 pyrosequencing-generated contigs and Sanger BAC-end sequences derived both from the Pt genome, and to ESTs and genome reads from wheat. A collection of 6,308 fungal genes was identified and compared to sequences of the cereal rusts, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) and stripe rust, P. striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), and poplar leaf rust Melampsora species, and the corn smut fungus, Ustilago maydis (Um). While extensive homologies were found, many genes appeared novel and species-specific; over 40% of genes did not match any known sequence in existing databases. Focusing on spore stages, direct comparison to Um identified potential functional homologs, possibly allowing heterologous functional analysis in that model fungus.

"11117259","abstracttext","Intron-containing tRNA genes are exceptional within nuclear plant genomes. It appears that merely two tRNA gene families coding for tRNA(GpsiA(Tyr)) and elongator tRNA(CmAU(Met)) contain intervening sequences. We have previously investigated the features required by wheat germ splicing endonuclease for efficient and accurate intron excision from Arabidopsis pre-tRNA(Tyr). Here we have studied the expression of an Arabidopsis elongator tRNA(Met) gene in two plant extracts of different origin. This gene was first transcribed either in HeLa or in tobacco cell nuclear extract and splicing of intron-containing tRNA(Met) precursors was then examined in wheat germ S23 extract and in the tobacco system. The results show that conversion of pre-tRNA(Met) to mature tRNA proceeds very efficiently in both plant extracts. In order to elucidate the potential role of specific nucleotides at the 3' and 5' splice sites and of a structured intron for pre-tRNA(Met) splicing in either extract, we have performed a systematic survey by mutational analyses. The results show that cytidine residues at intron-exon boundaries impair pre-tRNA(Met) splicing and that a highly structured intron is indispensable for pre-tRNA(Met) splicing. tRNA precursors with an extended anticodon stem of three to four base pairs are readily accepted as substrates by wheat and tobacco splicing endonuclease, whereas pre-tRNA molecules that can form an extended anticodon stem of only two putative base pairs are not spliced at all. An amber suppressor, generated from the intron-containing elongator tRNA(Met) gene, is efficiently processed and spliced in both plant extracts."

"11793221","abstracttext","This paper describes the construction and characterisation of a cDNA library from wheat endosperm tissue during the early stages of grain filling. Developing wheat endosperm tissue was characterised with respect to standard measures including dry weight, cytological appearance and timing of expression of major sources of mRNA such as the seed storage protein genes. In addition, the full complement of proteins present at mid-endosperm development was examined using 2D-electrophoretic techniques. Based on this characterisation, endosperm from the developing grain 8-12 days post-anthesis was chosen for isolating mRNA and preparing cDNA. At this stage in development the mRNA population is not yet dominated by the accumulation of mRNA from seed storage protein genes. A cDNA library, not normalised, containing a high percentage of full length cDNA clones was constructed and 4,319 clones sequenced (""single-pass""). Partitioning of the cDNA sequences into gene families and singletons provided the basis for quantifying the accumulation of sequence classes relative to the total number of sequences determined. The accumulation of gene families/singletons was not linear. However, mathematical modeling of the data suggested that the maximum number of different genes expressed is within the range of 4,500-8,000 (detailed in the Appendix). If an average is taken of these extremes, approximately 27% of the gene products were visible as proteins in the 2D-electrophoretic analysis. Analysis of a functional class of genes relevant to wheat grain end-use, namely the glutenin/gliadin seed storage protein class of genes, revealed a new category of gene characterised by a distinctive N-terminal domain and a reduced central repetitive domain."

The system uses 4-day precultured immature embryos as explants. A total of 30 vectors containing the 5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase gene from Agrobacterium strain CP4 (aroA:CP4), which confers resistance to glyphosate, were introduced into wheat using this system. The aroA:CP4 gene served two roles in this study-selectable marker and gene of interest. More than 3,000 transgenic events were produced with an average transformation efficiency of 4.4%. The entire process from isolation of immature embryos to production of transgenic plantlets was 50-80 days. Transgenic events were evaluated over several generations based on genetic, agronomic and molecular criteria. Forty-six percent of the transgenic events fit a 3:1 segregation ratio. Molecular analysis confirmed that four of six lead transgenic events selected from Agrobacterium transformation contained a single insert and a single copy of the transgene. Stable expression of theAROA:CP4 gene was confirmed by ELISA through nine generations. A comparison of Agrobacterium-mediated transformation to a particle bombardment system demonstrated that the Agrobacterium system is reproducible, has a higher transformation efficiency with glyphosate selection and produces higher quality transgenic events in wheat. One of the lead events from this study, no. 33391, has been identified as a Roundup Ready wheat commercial candidate."

A clear understanding of the genetics of resistance and the identification of linked PCR-based markers will facilitate the recovery of wheat lines carrying multiple septoria tritici blotch resistance genes. The resistance gene in ST6 to isolate MG2 of M. graminicola was mapped with microsatellite markers in two populations, ST6/Erik and ST6/Katepwa. Bulk segregant analysis identified a marker on chromosome 4AL putatively linked to the resistance gene. A large linkage group was identified in each population using additional microsatellite markers mapping to chromosome 4AL. The resistance gene in ST6 mapped to the distal end of chromosome 4AL in each mapping population and was designated Stb7. Three of the microsatellite loci, Xwmc313, Xwmc219 and Xgwm160, mapped within 3.5 cM of Stb7; however, none flanked Stb7. Xwmc313 was the closest and mapped 0.3 and 0.5 cM from Stb7 in the crosses ST6/Katepwa and ST6/Erik, respectively. WMC313 will be very useful for marker-assisted selection of Stb7 in Canadian breeding programs because the ST6 allele of Xwmc313 was not identified in any of the Canadian common wheat cultivars tested."

"16932880","abstracttext","Some allelic forms of low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) can greatly influence the end-use of wheat flours, understanding the function of each allele of LMW-GS is important to wheat quality breeding. A LMW-GS gene XYGluD3-LMWGS 1(AY263369) has been cloned from bread wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6. The deduced protein contained nine cystine residues, one more than that in all other LMW-GSs reported previously, indicating that it is either a new gene or a new allele of a known LMW-GS gene. In this study, the gene was expressed in E. coil in large scale for the testing of its functional property. Reactive Red 120-Agarose resin was used efficiently to purify the expressed LMW-GS proteins from bacteria, with the lactic acid-sodium lactate buffer (pH 4.5) which contained low concentration SDS as elution solution. The purified protein (belonging to the LMW-m family, MW about 35 KDa) was supplemented into a base flour, the results of 10 g dough mixing test indicated that incorporation of the LMW-GS increased the strength of the dough, with significant increases in mixing time (MT) and peak width (PW), and decrease in breakdown in resistance (RBD) compared with the control. In addition, the dough with incorporation of the LMW-GS had more glutenin macropolyeric protein than the control, suggesting that the LMW-GS participated in forming larger glutenin polymers, and greatly contributed to dough strength. The changes in mixing parameters and the amount of glutenin macropolyeric protein were related to the quantity of incorporating subunits."

"18092148","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is an important foliar disease in wheat, especially in areas with a cool or maritime climate. A dominant powdery mildew resistance gene transferred to the hexaploid germplasm line NC99BGTAG11 from T. timopheevii subsp. armeniacum was mapped distally on the long arm of chromosome 7A. Differential reactions were observed between the resistance gene in NC99BGTAG11 and the alleles of the Pm1 locus that is also located on chromosome arm 7AL. Observed segregation in F2:3 lines from the cross NC99BGTAG11xAxminster (Pm1a) demonstrate that germplasm line NC99BGTAG11 carries a novel powdery mildew resistance gene, which is now designated as Pm37. This new gene is highly effective against all powdery mildew isolates tested so far. Analyses of the population with molecular markers indicate that Pm37 is located 16 cM proximal to the Pm1 complex. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers Xgwm332 and Xwmc790 were located 0.5 cM proximal and distal, respectively, to Pm37. In order to identify new markers in the region, wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) located in the distal 10% of 7AL that were orthologous to sequences from chromosome 6 of rice were targeted. The two new EST-derived STS markers were located distal to Pm37 and one marker was closely linked to the Pm1a region. These new markers can be used in marker-assisted selection schemes to develop wheat cultivars with pyramids of powdery mildew resistance genes, including combinations of Pm37 in coupling linkage with alleles of the Pm1 locus."

"20352181","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks, is one of the most common and persistent wheat diseases in the US Great Plains. We report that the Lr34 gene was mapped in the center of a QTL for leaf rust reaction and explained 18-35% of the total phenotypic variation in disease severity of adult plants in a Jagger x 2174 population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) field-tested for 3 years. The sequence of the complete Lr34 gene was determined for the susceptible Jagger allele and for the resistant 2174 allele. The two alleles had exactly the same sequence as the resistant allele reported previously in Chinese Spring at three polymorphic sites in intron 4, exon 11, and exon 12. A G/T polymorphism was found in exon 22, where a premature stop codon was found in the susceptible Jagger allele (Lr34E22s), confirming a previous report, due to a point mutation compared with the resistant 2174 allele (Lr34E22r). We have experimentally demonstrated a tight association between the point mutation at exon 22 of Lr34 and leaf rust susceptibility in a segregating biparental population. A PCR marker was developed to distinguish between the Lr34E22r and Lr34E22s alleles. A survey of 33 local hard winter wheat cultivars indicated that 7 cultivars carry the Lr34E22s allele and 26 cultivars carry the Lr34E22r allele. This study significantly improves our genetic understanding of allelic variation in the Lr34 gene and provides a functional molecular tool to improve leaf rust resistance in a major US wheat gene pool."

"19522561","abstracttext","Analysis of the fully sequenced genome of the wheat leaf-specific fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola identified only a single gene encoding a member of the necrosis- and ethylene-inducing peptide 1 (Nep1)-like protein family (NLP). NLP proteins have frequently been shown to trigger cell death and the activation of defense signaling reactions in dicotyledonous plants. However, complete loss-of-function reverse genetics analyses for their importance in the virulence of eukaryotic plant pathogens are generally lacking. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction on MgNLP demonstrated the gene to be specifically expressed in planta. Peak expression was observed during the immediate presymptomatic phase of colonization of a susceptible host genotype. This was followed by a dramatic decrease during disease lesion formation which, in this system, exhibits characteristics of host programmed cell death (PCD). No comparable peak in transcript levels was seen during an incompatible interaction with a host genotype exhibiting gene-for-gene-based disease resistance. Heterologously expressed MgNLP protein induced necrotic cell death and the activation of defense-related genes when infiltrated into Arabidopsis leaves but not in leaves of a susceptible wheat genotype. MgNLP infiltration also failed to stimulate wheat mitogen-activated protein kinase activities. Finally, targeted deletion of M. graminicola MgNLP caused no detectable reduction in plant pathogenicity or virulence, suggesting that this protein is not a major virulence determinant during fungal infection of its host plant. To our knowledge, this represents the first complete loss-of-function analysis of NLP in a eukaryotic plant pathogen and we discuss our findings in the context of possible functions for NLP in pathogens which only infect monocotyledonous plants."

"23417582","abstracttext","Rust fungi are devastating plant pathogens and several Puccinia species have a large economic impact on wheat production worldwide. Disease protection, mostly offered by introgressed host-resistance genes, is often race-specific and rapidly overcome by newly-emerging virulent strains. Extensive new genomic resources have identified vital pathogenicity genes but their study is hampered because of the biotrophic life styles of rust fungi. In cereals, Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-induced RNAi has emerged as a useful tool to study loss-of-function phenotypes of candidate genes. Expression of pathogen-derived gene fragments in this system can be used to obtain in planta-generated silencing of corresponding genes inside biotrophic pathogens, a technique termed host-induced gene silencing (HIGS). Here we test the effectiveness of BSMV-mediated HIGS in the wheat leaf rust fungus Puccinia triticina (Pt) by targeting three predicted pathogenicity genes, a MAPK, a cyclophilin, and a calcineurin regulatory subunit. Inoculation of BSMV RNAi constructs generated fungal gene-specific siRNA molecules in systemic leaves of wheat plant. Subsequent Pt inoculation resulted in a suppressed disease phenotype and a reduction in endogenous transcript levels of the targeted fungal genes indicating translocation of siRNA molecules from host to fungal cells. Efficiency of this host-generated trans-specific RNAi was enhanced by using BSMV silencing vectors defective in coat protein coupled with introducing fungal gene sequences simultaneously in sense and antisense orientation. The disease suppression indicated the likely involvement of these fungal genes in pathogenicity. This study demonstrates that BSMV-mediated in planta-generated RNAi is an effective strategy for functional genomics in rust fungi."

"23880093","abstracttext","Heptanoyl salicylic acid (HSA) is a salicylic acid (SA) derivative obtained by esterification of 2-OH benzoic acid with heptanoic acid. In wheat, the protection levels obtained against Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) increased from 50% with SA to 95% with HSA. Using molecular, biochemical and cytological approaches, we investigated here how wheat lipid metabolism is differentially activated by SA and HSA in both infectious and non-infectious conditions, and how Bgt infectious process is altered by both inducers. First, in the absence of Bgt, continuous lipoxygenase (LOX)-encoding gene expression and corresponding activity were specifically induced by HSA. Moreover, compared to SA, HSA treatment resulted in earlier up-regulations of the phospholipase C2-encoding gene expression and it specifically affected the expression of a lipid transfer protein-encoding gene. In infectious context, both HSA and SA sprayings impaired penetration events and therefore haustorium formation, leading to less frequent fungal colonies. While this alteration only slowed down the evolution of Bgt infectious process in SA-sprayed leaves, it completely impaired the establishment of successful infectious events in HSA-sprayed leaves. In addition, HSA induced continuous increases of a LOX-encoding gene expression and of the corresponding LOX activity when compared to SA-sprayed leaves. Lipid metabolism is therefore overall highly responsive to HSA spraying and could represent effective defence mechanism triggered during the induction of resistance in wheat toward Bgt. The concepts of priming and energy costs of the defences induced by SA and HSA are also discussed."

"24469473","abstracttext_key message","Fine mapping of the Ug99 effective stem rust resistance gene Sr45 introgressed into common wheat from the D -genome goatgrass Aegilops tauschii. Stem rust resistance gene Sr45, discovered in Aegilops tauschii, the progenitor of the D -genome of wheat, is effective against commercially important Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici races prevalent in Australia, South Africa and the Ug99 race group. A synthetic hexaploid wheat (RL5406) generated by crossing Ae. tauschii accession RL5289 (carrying Sr45 and the leaf rust resistance gene Lr21) with a tetraploid experimental line 'TetraCanthatch' was previously used as the source in the transfer of these rust resistance genes to other hexaploid cultivars. Previous genetic studies on hexaploid wheats mapped Sr45 on the short arm of chromosome 1D with the following gene order: centromere-Sr45-Sr33-Lr21-telomere. To identify closely linked markers, we fine mapped the Sr45 region in a large mapping population generated by crossing CS1D5406 (disomic substitution line with chromosome 1D of RL5406 substituted for Chinese Spring 1D) with Chinese Spring. Closely linked markers based on 1DS-specific microsatellites, expressed sequence tags and AFLP were useful in the delineation of the Sr45 region. Sequences from an AFLP marker amplified a fragment that was linked with Sr45 at a distance of 0.39 cM. The fragment was located in a bacterial artificial chromosome clone of contig (ctg)2981 of the Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78 physical map. A PCR marker derived from clone MI221O11 of ctg2981 amplified 1DS-specific sequence that harboured an 18-bp indel polymorphism that specifically tagged the Sr45 carrying haplotype. This new Sr45 marker can be combined with a previously reported marker for Lr21, which will facilitate selecting Sr45 and Lr21 in breeding populations."

"24301053","abstracttext","Two histone H3 and two histone H4 genes have been cloned from a λgtWESλ·B Arabidopsis thaliana gene library. From their nucleotide sequences and from studies on their genomic organization, the following conclusions can be drawn: : 1) The nucleotide sequences of the two H3 coding regions show only 85% homology, but encode the same proteins. The Arabidopsis H3 has the same amino acid sequence as its counterpart in corn, but differs from that of pea and wheat by replacement in position 90 of a serine by an alanine. The two H4 coding regions have 97% sequence homology and encode the same protein, identical to the sequence of their counterpart in pea, corn and one H4 variant in wheat. 2) The 5'-flanking regions of the 4 genes contain the classical histone-gene-specific consensus sequences, except H3A725 which lacks the GATCC-like pentamer. The conserved octanucleotide 5'-CGCGGATC-3' which was previously found in the 5'-flanking sequences of corn and wheat H3 and H4 genes is also present in all four genes described here approximately 200 to 250 nucleotides upstream from the initiation ATG. The 5'-flanking regions of the H4 genes display extensive sequence homology, whereas those of the H3 genes do not. 3) The 3'-flanking regions do not possess the classical histone-gene-specific T hyphenated dyad symmetry motif. 4) Each H3 and H4 gene exists as 5 to 7 copies per haploid genome."

To control this disease, breeders have incorporated seedling resistance genes from a variety of sources outside the primary wheat gene pool. The wheat line C51, introduced from the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), Syria, confers resistance to all races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST) in China. To map the resistant gene(s) against stripe rust in wheat line C51, 212 F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross X440 x C51 were inoculated with Chinese PST race CYR33 (Chinese yellow rust, CYR) in the greenhouse. The result showed that C51 carried a single dominant gene for resistance (designated YrC51) to CYR33. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and resistance gene-analogue polymorphism (RGAP) markers that were polymorphic between the parents were used for genotyping the 212 F8 RILs. YrC51 was closely linked to two SSR loci on chromosome 2BS with genetic distances of 5.1 cM (Xgwm429) and 7.2 cM (Xwmc770), and to three RGAP markers C51R1 (XLRR For / NLRR For), C51R2 (CLRR Rev / Cre3LR-F) and C51R3 (Pto kin4 / NLRRINV2) with genetic distances of 5.6, 1.6 and 9.2 cM, respectively. These RGAP-linked markers were then converted into STS markers.Among them, one STS marker, C51STS-4, was located at a genetic distance of 1.4 cM to YrC51 and was closely associated with resistance when validated in several populations derived from crosses between C51 and Sichuan cultivars. The results indicated that C51STS-4 can be used for marker assisted selection (MAS) and would facilitate the pyramiding of YrC51 with other genes for stripe rust resistance."

It is important to find the genes that correspond to individual LMW-GS proteins in order to understand the functions of specific proteins. The objective of this study was to link LMW-GS genes and haplotypes characterized using well known Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3 gene-specific primers to their protein products in a single wheat variety. A total of 36 LMW-GS genes and pseudogenes were amplified from the Korean cultivar Keumkang. These include 11 Glu-3 gene haplotypes, two from the Glu-A3 locus, two from the Glu-B3 locus, and seven from the Glu-D3 locus. To establish relationships between gene haplotypes and their protein products, a glutenin protein fraction was separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) and 17 protein spots were analyzed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). LMW-GS proteins were identified that corresponded to all Glu-3 gene haplotypes except the pseudogenes. This is the first report of the comprehensive characterization of LMW-GS genes and their corresponding proteins in a single wheat cultivar.

"28935260","abstracttext","Leaf rust is a fungal disease that causes severe yield losses in wheat. Resistant varieties with major and quantitative resistance genes are the most effective method to control the disease. However, the main problem is inadequate information for understanding resistance mechanism and its usefulness. This paper presents Lr28 mediated genome-wide response of known and unknown genes during wheat-Puccinia triticina interaction. In this study, we prepared Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) libraries using seedling wheat mRNA for infected and mock conditions. The libraries were sequenced on Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection (SOLiD) system generating 37-48 million reads. After mapping and gene expression analysis of ~6-12 million trimmed reads/library, we revealed five major categories comprised of Lr28 controlled transcripts in resistant (+Lr28) isoline (39), transcripts specific to susceptible (-Lr28) isoline (785), transcripts specific to hypersensitive-response (HR) (375), transcripts specific for basal-defense (153) and transcripts for establishment of pathogen (1616). We estimated the impact of specific genes and pathways through mapping on plant resistant gene database (PRGdb), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phytohormone database. Functional annotation results revealed, receptor binding, homeostatic processes and cytoskeletal components as the major discriminating factors between susceptibility and resistance. We validated 28 key genes using qRT-PCR and found positive results. These findings were projected on hypothetical interaction model to demonstrate interaction mechanism. The study might have significant impact on future rust-resistance breeding through knowledge based smart genetic selection of quantitative resistance genes besides major effect R-gene."

"27541276","abstracttext_key message","Wheat bHLH family gene TabHLH1 is responsive to drought and salt stresses, and it acts as one crucial regulator in mediating tolerance to aforementioned stresses largely through an ABA-associated pathway. Osmotic stresses are adverse factors for plant growth and crop productivity. In this study, we characterized TabHLH1, a gene encoding wheat bHLH-type transcription factor (TF) protein, in mediating plant adaptation to osmotic stresses. TabHLH1 protein contains a conserved basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) domain shared by its plant counterparts. Upon PEG-simulated drought stress, salt stress, and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), the TabHLH1 transcripts in roots and leaves were induced. Under PEG-simulated drought stress and salt stress treatments, the tobacco seedlings with TabHLH1 overexpression exhibited improved growth and osmotic stress-associated traits, showing increased biomass and reduced leaf water loss rate (WLR) relative to wild type (WT). The transgenic lines also possessed promoted stomata closure under drought stress, salt stress, and exogenous ABA and increased proline and soluble sugar contents and reduced hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) amount under osmotic stress conditions, indicating that TabHLH1-mediated osmolyte accumulation and cellular ROS homeostasis contributed to the drought stress and salt stress tolerance. NtPYL12 and NtSAPK2;1, the genes encoding ABA receptor and SnRK2 family kinase, respectively, showed up-regulated expression in lines overexpressing TabHLH1 under osmotic stress and exogenous ABA conditions; overexpression of them conferred plants modified stomata movement, leaf WLR, and growth feature under drought and high salinity, suggesting that these ABA-signaling genes are mediated by wheat TabHLH1 gene and involved in regulating plant responses to simulated drought and salt stresses. Our investigation indicates that the TabHLH1 gene plays critical roles in plant tolerance to osmotic stresses largely through an ABA-dependent pathway."

The genomes of Pt and Pst were sequenced and compared to that of Pgt to identify common and distinguishing gene content, to determine gene variation among wheat rust pathogens, other rust fungi, and basidiomycetes, and to identify genes of significance for infection. Pt had the largest genome of the three, estimated at 135 Mb with expansion due to mobile elements and repeats encompassing 50.9% of contig bases; in comparison, repeats occupy 31.5% for Pst and 36.5% for Pgt We find all three genomes are highly heterozygous, with Pst [5.97 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)/kb] nearly twice the level detected in Pt (2.57 SNPs/kb) and that previously reported for Pgt Of 1358 predicted effectors in Pt , 784 were found expressed across diverse life cycle stages including the sexual stage. Comparison to related fungi highlighted the expansion of gene families involved in transcriptional regulation and nucleotide binding, protein modification, and carbohydrate degradation enzymes. Two allelic homeodomain pairs, HD1 and HD2, were identified in each dikaryotic Puccinia species along with three pheromone receptor ( STE3 ) mating-type genes, two of which are likely representing allelic specificities.

In the Great Plains of the USA, Bgt isolates virulent to widely used powdery mildew resistance genes, such as Pm3a, were previously identified. The objectives of this study were to characterize the powdery mildew resistance gene in Afghanistan landrace PI 181356, which exhibited high resistance to Bgt isolates collected in southern Great Plains, and identify molecular markers for marker-assisted selection. An F 2 population and F 2:3 lines derived from a cross between PI 181356 and OK1059060-126135-3 were used in this study. Genetic analysis indicated that PI 181356 carries a single dominant gene, designated Pm59, in the terminal region of the long arm of chromosome 7A. Pm59 was mapped to an interval between sequence tag site (STS) markers Xmag1759 and Xmag1714 with genetic distances of 0.4 cM distal to Xmag1759 and 5.7 cM proximal to Xmag1714. Physical mapping suggested that Pm59 is in the distal bin 7AL 0.99-1.00. Pm59 is a novel powdery mildew resistance gene, and confers resistance to Bgt isolates collected from the Great Plains and the state of Montana. Therefore, Pm59 can be used to breed powdery mildew-resistant cultivars in these regions. Xmag1759 is ideal for marker-assisted selection of Pm59 in wheat breeding."

Identifying and combining specific genes controlling distinct biological processes holds the potential to enhance crop yields. Transcriptomics is a powerful tool to gain insights into the complex gene regulatory networks that underlie such traits, but relies on the availability of a high-quality reference sequence and accurate gene models. Previously, we identified a grain weight QTL on wheat chromosome 5A (5A QTL) which acts during early grain development to increase grain length through cell expansion in the pericarp. In this study, we performed RNA-sequencing on near isogenic lines (NILs) segregating for the 5A QTL and used the latest gene models to identify differentially regulated genes and pathways that potentially influence pericarp cell size and grain weight in wheat."

The 112 DE transcripts had functional annotations including non-coding RNA, transposon-associated, cell-cycle control, ubiquitin-related, heat-shock, transcription and histone-related. Many of the genes identified belong to families that have been previously associated with seed/grain development in other species. Notably, we identified DE transcripts at almost all steps of the pathway associated with ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

We found differences both in the number and the position of selective sweeps across the genome between populations. Using a XtX-based outlier detection approach, we identified 51 extremely divergent genomic regions between the allopatric populations, suggesting that divergent selection led to locally adapted pathogen populations. We performed an outlier detection analysis between two sympatric populations infecting two different wheat cultivars to identify evidence for host-driven selection. Selective sweep regions harboured genes that are likely to play a role in successfully establishing host infections. We also identified secondary metabolite gene clusters and an enrichment in genes encoding transporter and protein localization functions. The latter gene functions mediate responses to environmental stress, including interactions with the host. The distinct gene functions under selection indicate that both local host genotypes and abiotic factors contributed to local adaptation."

"28857322","abstracttext","Among the wheat prolamins important for its end-use traits, α-gliadins are the most abundant, and are also a major cause of food-related allergies and intolerances. Previous studies of various wheat species estimated that between 25 and 150 α-gliadin genes reside in the Gli-2 locus regions. To better understand the evolution of this complex gene family, the DNA sequence of a 1.75-Mb genomic region spanning the Gli-2 locus was analyzed in the diploid grass, Aegilops tauschii, the ancestral source of D genome in hexaploid bread wheat. Comparison with orthologous regions from rice, sorghum, and Brachypodium revealed rapid and dynamic changes only occurring to the Ae. tauschii Gli-2 region, including insertions of high numbers of non-syntenic genes and a high rate of tandem gene duplications, the latter of which have given rise to 12 copies of α-gliadin genes clustered within a 550-kb region. Among them, five copies have undergone pseudogenization by various mutation events. Insights into the evolutionary relationship of the duplicated α-gliadin genes were obtained from their genomic organization, transcription patterns, transposable element insertions and phylogenetic analyses. An ancestral glutamate-like receptor (GLR) gene encoding putative amino acid sensor in all four grass species has duplicated only in Ae. tauschii and generated three more copies that are interspersed with the α-gliadin genes. Phylogenetic inference and different gene expression patterns support functional divergence of the Ae. tauschii GLR copies after duplication. Our results suggest that the duplicates of α-gliadin and GLR genes have likely taken different evolutionary paths; conservation for the former and neofunctionalization for the latter."

"32677132","abstracttext","The incorporation of resistance genes into wheat commercial varieties is the ideal strategy to combat stripe or yellow rust (YR). In a search for novel resistance genes, we performed a large-scale genomic association analysis with high-density 660K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays to determine the genetic components of YR resistance in 411 spring wheat lines. Following quality control, 371 972 SNPs were screened, covering over 50% of the high-confidence annotated gene space. Nineteen stable genomic regions harbouring 292 significant SNPs were associated with adult-plant YR resistance across nine environments. Of these, 14 SNPs were localized in the proximity of known loci widely used in breeding. Obvious candidate SNP variants were identified in certain confidence intervals, such as the cloned gene Yr18 and the major locus on chromosome 2BL, despite a large extent of linkage disequilibrium. The number of causal SNP variants was refined using an independent validation panel and consideration of the estimated functional importance of each nucleotide polymorphism. Interestingly, four natural polymorphisms causing amino acid changes in the gene TraesCS2B01G513100 that encodes a serine/threonine protein kinase (STPK) were significantly involved in YR responses. Gene expression and mutation analysis confirmed that STPK played an important role in YR resistance. PCR markers were developed to identify the favourable TraesCS2B01G513100 haplotype for marker-assisted breeding. These results demonstrate that high-resolution SNP-based GWAS enables the rapid identification of putative resistance genes and can be used to improve the efficiency of marker-assisted selection in wheat disease resistance breeding."

Using a differential nuclease sensitivity assay, we investigate the chromatin states of the coding and repetitive regions of the allopolyploid wheat genome."
"32684157","abstracttext_results","Although open chromatin is found to be significantly enriched around genes, the majority of MNase-sensitive regions are located within transposable elements (TEs). Chromatin of the smaller D genome is more accessible than that of the larger A and B genomes. Chromatin states of different TEs vary among families and are influenced by the TEs' chromosomal position and proximity to genes. While the chromatin accessibility of genes is influenced by proximity to TEs, and not by their position on the chromosomes, we observe a negative chromatin accessibility gradient along the telomere-centromere axis in the intergenic regions, positively correlated with the distance between genes. Both gene expression levels and homoeologous gene expression bias are correlated with chromatin accessibility in promoter regions. The differential nuclease sensitivity assay accurately predicts previously detected centromere locations. SNPs located within more accessible chromatin explain a higher proportion of genetic variance for a number of agronomic traits than SNPs located within more closed chromatin."

"30327847","abstracttext_key message","A new recessive powdery mildew resistance gene, Pm223899, was identified in Afghanistan wheat landrace PI 223899 and mapped to an interval of about 831 Kb in the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 1A. Wheat powdery mildew, a globally important disease caused by the biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt), has occurred with increased frequency and severity in recent years, and some widely deployed resistance genes have lost effectiveness. PI 223899 is an Afghanistan landrace exhibiting high resistance to Bgt isolates collected from the Great Plains. An F 2 population and F 2:3 lines derived from a cross between PI 223899 and OK1059060-126135-3 were evaluated for response to Bgt isolate OKS(14)-B-3-1, and the bulked segregant analysis (BSA) approach was used to map the powdery mildew resistance gene. Genetic analysis indicated that a recessive gene, designated Pm223899, conferred powdery mildew resistance in PI 223899. Linkage analysis placed Pm223899 to an interval of about 831 Kb in the terminal region of chromosome 1AS, spanning 4,504,697-5,336,062 bp of the Chinese Spring reference sequence. Eight genes were predicted in this genomic region, including TraesCS1AG008300 encoding a putative disease resistance protein RGA4. Pm223899 was flanked proximally by a SSR marker STARS333 (1.4 cM) and distally by the Pm3 locus (0.3 cM). One F 2 recombinant was identified between Pm3 and Pm223899 using a Pm3b-specific marker, indicating that Pm223899 is most likely a new gene, rather than an allele of the Pm3 locus. Pm223389 confers a high level of resistance to Bgt isolates collected from Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Nebraska, and Montana. Therefore, Pm223389 can be used to enhance powdery mildew resistance in these states. Pm3b-1 and STARS333 have the potential to tag Pm223389 in wheat breeding."

"32076614","abstracttext","In semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems, drought and salinity are the main abiotic stresses hampering wheat productivity and yield instability. Abscisic acid, stress, and ripening (ASR) are small plant proteins and play important roles in different biological processes. In the present study, the Tt ASR1 gene was isolated and characterized for the first time from durum wheat ( Tritucum turgidum L. subsp. durum ). Tt ASR1 is a small gene, about 684 bp long, located on chromosome 4AL, encoding a protein of 136 amino acid residues consisting of a histidine-rich N terminus and C-terminal conserved ABA-WDS domain (Pfam PF02496). Our results showed that Tt ASR1 protein could function as a chaperone-like protein and improve the viability of E. coli under heat and cold stress and increase the Saccharomyces cerevisiae tolerance under salt and osmotic stress. Transcript expression patterns of Tt ASR1 revealed that ASRs play important roles in abiotic stress responses in diverse organs. Indeed, Tt ASR1 was upregulated in leaves by different developmental (ABA) and environmental signals (PEG, salt). In cv . Mahmoudi (salt-tolerant Tunisian durum landraces) roots, Tt ASR1 was upregulated by salt stress, while it was downregulated in cv. Azizi (salt-sensitive Tunisian durum landraces), supporting the implication of this gene in the salt tolerance mechanism. Taken together and after validation in the plant system, the Tt ASR1 gene may provide a potential functional marker for marker-assisted selection in a durum wheat breeding program for salt tolerance."

"33228321","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks., is one of the most widespread diseases of wheat and breeding for resistance is one of the most effective methods of control. Lr16 is a wheat leaf rust resistance gene (R-gene) that provides resistance at both the seedling and adult stages. Simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been used to map Lr16 to the distal end of chromosome 2B. The objectives of this study were to use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and in silico subtraction to identify new R-gene analogs (RGAs) and use them as Lr16 markers. RNA was isolated from the susceptible wheat cultivar Thatcher (Tc) and the resistant Tc isolines TcLr10, TcLr16, TcLr21, and sequenced using Illumina technology. Using in silico subtraction, sequences from the resistant Tc isolines were aligned to a Tc reference expressed sequence tag (EST) set. Sequences not aligning to the Tc reference were assembled into contigs and analyzed using BLASTx to determine putative gene functions. Primer pairs were designed for 181 RGA sequences, of which, 137 amplified in at least one of the parents. A mapping population was developed with 165 F 2 lines from a cross between the rust-susceptible cultivar Chinese Spring (CS) and TcLr16. Two RGA markers XTaLr16_RGA266585 and XTaLr16_RGA22128 were identified that mapped proximally 1.2 and 23.8 cM from Lr16, respectively. Three SSR markers Xwmc764, Xwmc661, and Xbarc35 mapped between these two RGA markers at distances of 5.0, 10.9, and 16.1 cM from Lr16, respectively. In silico subtraction is an effective technique for isolating RGAs linked to R-genes of interest."
"321457","articletitle","Effect of estrogen on gene expression in the chick oviduct."
"321457","abstracttext","Mercurated UTP was used as a substrate for RNA polymerases in the in vitro transcription of chromatin so that newly synthesized RNA could be efficiently separated from endogenous chromatin RNA by means of sulfhydryl-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Utilizing this technique, it was possible to examine the effect of varying enzyme to DNA ratios on the transcription of specific genes from chromatin. For both Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and wheat germ RNA polymerase II, lowering the enzyme to DNA ration resulted in an increase in the percentage of ovalbumin mRNA sequences transcribed from chick oviduct chromatin. Similar results were also obtained for the transcription of the globin gene from chick reticulocyte chromatin. On the other hand, transcription of the globin gene from oviduct chromatin or the ovalbumin gene from reticulocyte chromatin or deproteinized chick DNA was not significantly affected by varying enzyme to DNA ratios. These results indicate that preferential transcription of certain chromatin genes relative to total RNA synthesis can occur and that this process is dependent on the presence of chromosomal proteins. Utilizing a cDNA probe complementary to the anticoding strand of the ovalbumin gene, the degree of asymmetry of the in vitro transcription of this gene was also examined. The percentage of ovalbumin RNA sequences homologous to the anticoding strand was not significantly affected when the enzyme to DNA ratio was lowered 16-fold. Since the percentage of coding ovalbumin mRNA sequences increased more than 6-fold over the same range, the percentage of asymmetric transcription of this gene increased. At the lowest enzyme to DNA ratio tested, the transcription of the ovalbumin gene from oviduct chromatin was almost totally asymmetric and, thus, closely resembled the pattern of gene transcription characteristic of the in vivo state."

"1849629","abstracttext","A maize (Zea mays L.) endosperm cell culture has been shown to efficiently replicate DNA sequences derived from wheat dwarf virus (WDV), a monopartite monocot geminivirus. To analyze sequences necessary for viral replication and to verify their application for a plant gene expression vector, we have developed a 3.7 kilobase pairs Escherichia coli--plant cell shuttle vector, pWI-11. The p15A origin of replication, functional in E. coli, was introduced into the viral sequences. We have replaced the coding region of the coat protein gene by that of bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase II (NPT II) gene. The resulting NPT II gene fusion can serve as a selectable marker in both plant and E. coli systems. Into a unique cloning site in this pWI-11 vector, we introduced a gene fusion carrying the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) coding region under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) gene promoter and terminator. By transferring these viral sequences into protoplasts derived from maize endosperm cell cultures, we have demonstrated that the plasmid pWI-11 can replicate in maize endosperm cells, that the GUS reporter gene introduced into pWI-11 can be expressed at high level in the transformed cells, and that the replicating viral DNA can be rescued from endosperm cells by transforming E. coli in the presence of kanamycin. The level of GUS gene expression increased progressively in transformed endosperm cells during a prolonged culture period, coinciding with replication of the viral sequences in these cells."

"18944233","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Production of the polyketide antimicrobial metabolite 2,4-diacetyl-phloroglucinol (DAPG) is a key factor in the biocontrol activity of Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0. Strain CHA0 carrying a translational phlA'-'lacZ fusion was used to monitor expression of the phl biosynthetic genes in vitro and in the rhizosphere. Expression of the reporter gene accurately reflected actual production of DAPG in vitro and in planta as determined by direct extraction of the antimicrobial compound. In a gnotobiotic system containing a clay and sand-based artificial soil, reporter gene expression was significantly greater in the rhizospheres of two monocots (maize and wheat) compared with gene expression in the rhizospheres of two dicots (bean and cucumber). We observed this host genotype effect on bacterial gene expression also at the level of cultivars. Significant differences were found among six additional maize cultivars tested under gnotobiotic conditions. There was no difference between transgenic maize expressing the Bacillus thuringiensis insecticidal gene cry1Ab and the near-isogenic parent line. Plant age had a significant impact on gene expression. Using maize as a model, expression of the phlA'-'lacZ reporter gene peaked at 24 h after planting of pregerminated seedlings, and dropped to a fourth of that value within 48 h, remaining at that level throughout 22 days of plant growth. Root infection by Pythium ultimum stimulated bacterial gene expression on both cucumber and maize, and this was independent of differences in rhizosphere colonization on these host plants. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive evaluation of how biotic factors that commonly confront bacterial inoculants in agricultural systems (host genotype, host age, and pathogen infection) modulate the expression of key biocontrol genes for disease suppression."

"29547534","abstracttext","In this report, we described the genome of a novel baculovirus isolated from the monocot insect pest Mocis latipes , the striped grass looper. The genome has 134,272 bp in length with a G + C content of 38.3%. Based on the concatenated sequence of the 38 baculovirus core genes, we found that the virus is a betabaculovirus closely related to the noctuid-infecting betabaculoviruses including Pseudaletia unipuncta granulovirus (PsunGV), Trichoplusia ni granulovirus (TnGV), Helicoverpa armigera granulovirus (HearGV), and Xestia c-nigrum granulovirus (XecnGV). The virus may constitute a new Betabaculovirus species tentatively named Mocis latipes granulovirus (MolaGV). After gene content analysis, five open reading frames (ORFs) were found to be unique to MolaGV and several auxiliary genes were found including iap-3 , iap-5 , bro-a , bro-b , and three enhancins . The virus genome lacked both chitinase and cathepsin . We then looked at the evolutionary history of the enhancin gene and found that betabaculovirus acquired this gene from an alphabaculovirus followed by several duplication events. Gene duplication also happened to an endonuclease -like gene. Genomic and gene content analyses revealed both a strict collinearity and gene expansion into the genome of the MolaGV-related species. We also characterized the granulin gene using a recombinant Autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) and found that occlusion bodies were produced into the nucleus of infected cells and presented a polyhedral shape and no occluded virions within. Overall, betabaculovirus genome sequencing is of importance to the field as few genomes are publicly accessible. Mocis latipes is a secondary pest of maize, rice, and wheat crops in Brazil. Certainly, both the discovery and description of novel baculoviruses may lead to development of greener and safer pesticides in order to counteract and effectively control crop damage-causing insect populations."

"29968001","abstracttext","Particularly PIN1, PIN protein-mediated rate-limiting auxin distribution plays a critical role in plant differentiation. Although well-characterized in Arabidopsis, little is known about the structural and functional relationship of the PIN1 gene among other plants. Here, we report that the gene structure remained conserved among bryophytes and angiosperms while the gene size varied by ~ 17%. Although the positions were conserved, highly variable intron phase suggests preference for specific regions in the gene sequence for independent events of intron insertion. Significant variation was observed across gene length for insertions and deletions that were mainly localized to the exonic regions flanking intron 1, possibly demarcating the sequences prone to deletions/duplications. The N and C-terminals showed a higher protein sequence similarity (~ 80%) compared to the central hydrophilic loop (~ 26%). In addition to the signature domains and motifs, we identified four novel uncharacterized motifs in the central divergent loop of PIN1 protein. Three different homo-loci, one each on chromosome groups 4, 6, and 7, were identified in wheat each showing dramatically different expression patterns during different plant developmental stages. Virus-induced gene silencing of the TaPIN1 gene resulted up to 26% reduction in plant height. Because of its direct role in controlling plant height along with a higher expression during stem elongation, the TaPIN1 gene can be manipulated to regulate plant height."

To develop molecular markers for Yr9, a Yr9 near-isogenic line, near-isogenic lines with nine other Yr genes, and the recurrent wheat parent 'Avocet Susceptible' were evaluated for resistance in the seedling stage to North American P s. tritici races under controlled temperature in the greenhouse. The resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique was used to identify molecular markers for Yr9. The BC7:F, and BC7:F3 progeny, which were developed by backcrossing the Yr9 donor wheat cultivar Clement with 'Avocet Susceptible', were evaluated for resistance to stripe rust races. Genomic DNA was extracted from 203 BC7:F2 plants and used for cosegregation analysis. Of 16 RGAP markers confirmed by cosegregation analysis, 4 were coincident with Yr9 and 12 were closely linked to Yr9 with a genetic distance ranging from 1 to 18 cM. Analyses of nullitetrasomic 'Chinese Spring' lines with the codominant RGAP marker Xwgp13 confirmed that the markers and Yr9 were located on chromosome 1B. Six wheat cultivars reported to have 1B/1R wheat-rye translocations and, presumably, Yr9, and two rye cultivars were inoculated with four races of P. s. tritici and tested with 9 of the 16 RGAP markers. Results of these tests indicate that 'Clement', 'Aurora', 'Lovrin 10', 'Lovrin 13', and 'Riebesel 47/51' have Yr9 and that 'Weique' does not have Yr9. The genetic information and molecular markers obtained from this study should be useful in cloning Yr9, in identifying germplasm that may have Yr9, and in using marker-assisted selection for combining Yr9 with other stripe rust resistance genes."

"18433415","abstracttext","ABA-responsive element binding protein (AREB) and ABA-responsive element binding factor (ABF), members of the basic region/leucine zipper (bZIP)-type protein family, act as major transcription factors in ABA-responsive gene expression under abiotic stress conditions in Arabidopsis. Barley HvABI5 and rice transcription factor responsible for ABA regulation 1 (TRAB1) are homologues of AREB/ABF and are expressed in drought- and ABA-treated seedlings. However, no direct evidence has shown an association of an AREB/ABF-type transcription factor with stress tolerance in cereals. To understand the molecular basis of abiotic stress tolerance through a cereal AREB/ABF-type transcription factor, a wheat HvABI5 ortholog, Wabi5, was isolated and characterized. Wabi5 expression was activated by low temperature, drought and exogenous ABA treatment, and its expression pattern differed between two wheat accessions with distinct levels of stress tolerance and ABA sensitivity. Wabi5-expressing transgenic tobacco plants showed a significant increase in tolerance to abiotic stresses such as freezing, osmotic and salt stresses and a hypersensitivity to exogenous ABA in the seedling stage compared with wild-type plants. Expression of a GUS reporter gene under the control of promoters of three wheat cold-responsive/late embryogenesis abundant (Cor/Lea) genes, Wdhn13, Wrab18 and Wrab19, was enhanced by ectopic Wabi5 expression in wheat callus and tobacco plants. These results clearly indicated that WABI5 functions as a transcriptional regulator of the Cor/Lea genes in multiple abiotic stress responses in common wheat."

"15010608","abstracttext","Mycosphaerella graminicola, incitant of septoria tritici blotch, is a widespread and significant pathogen of wheat that is not closely related to other fungi being developed as genetic models for host-pathogen interactions. Several resistance genes in wheat have been identified, yet the molecular mechanisms of resistance are unknown. To identify host genes involved in the resistance response, expression profiles of the wheat line Tadinia (containing the Stb4 gene for resistance) and the susceptible line Yecora Rojo, non-inoculated or inoculated with M. graminicola, were compared by differential-display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR). Among the differentially expressed genes was a protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is well known as a molecular chaperone and component of signal-transduction pathways in animal systems but had not been implicated previously in plant defense response. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and northern analysis revealed that PDI was induced within 3 h of inoculation with highest induction in the pathogen-treated resistant lines. These responses of PDI were similar to the early and strong resistance-related responses displayed by the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, PR-1, PR-2 and PR-5. In contrast, a wheat lipoxygenase was down-regulated in the resistant lines at time points corresponding with peak induction of the PR genes. Thus, part of the resistance mechanism may involve repression of a gene that could otherwise aid fungal growth. Wheat responds much more rapidly than believed previously to signals produced by M.graminicola. These early responses begin prior to penetration of the host and appear to determine the outcome of the host-pathogen interaction."

"16847628","abstracttext","Antifreeze proteins (AFPs) adsorb to ice crystals and inhibit their growth, leading to non-colligative freezing point depression. Crops like spring wheat, that are highly susceptible to frost damage, can potentially be made frost tolerant by expressing AFPs in the cytoplasm and apoplast where ice recrystallisation leads to cellular damage. The protein sequence for HPLC-6 alpha-helical antifreeze protein from winter flounder was rationally redesigned after removing the prosequences in the native protein. Wheat nuclear gene preferred amino acid codons were used to synthesize a recombinant antifreeze gene, rAFPI. Antifreeze protein was targeted to the apoplast using a Murine leader peptide sequence from the mAb24 light chain or retained in the endoplasmic reticulum using C-terminus KDEL sequence. The coding sequences were placed downstream of the rice Actin promoter and Actin-1 intron and upstream of the nopaline synthase terminator in the plant expression vectors. Transgenic wheat lines were generated through micro projectile bombardment of immature embryos of spring wheat cultivar Seri 82. Levels of antifreeze protein in the transgenic lines without any targeting peptide were low (0.06-0.07%). The apoplast-targeted protein reached a level of 1.61% of total soluble protein, 90% of which was present in the apoplast. ER-retained protein accumulated in the cells at levels up to 0.65% of total soluble proteins. Transgenic wheat line T-8 with apoplast-targeted antifreeze protein exhibited the highest levels of antifreeze activity and provided significant freezing protection even at temperatures as low as -7 degrees C."

Here, we report the identification and validation of molecular markers linked to Sr6 that can be used for the detection of this gene in wheat breeding programs. A mapping population of 136 F2 plants and their F2:3 families derived from a cross between near-isogenic lines, 'Chinese Spring' and ISr6-Ra, were screened for stem rust reaction in the seedling stage. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) based on seedling tests was used to screen 418 SSR markers that covered the entire genome of wheat. Four markers, Xwmc453, Xcfd43, Xcfd77, and Xgwm484, were mapped within a chromosome region that spanned 9.7 cM from Sr6. The closest markers, Xwmc453 and Xcfd43, were linked to Sr6 at a distance of 1.1 and 1.5 cM, respectively. The markers Xwmc453 and Xcfd43 amplified Sr6-specific marker alleles that were diagnostic for Sr6 in a diverse set of 46 wheat accessions and breeding lines developed and/or collected in Australia, Canada, China, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mexico, South Africa, and USA. These markers can now be used for marker-assisted selection of Sr6 and for pyramiding it with other stem rust resistance genes."

"18855109","abstracttext","Stem rust is a serious disease of wheat that has caused historical epidemics, but it has not been a threat in recent decades in North America owing to the eradication of the alternative host and deployment of resistant cultivars. However, the recent emergence of Ug99 (or race TTKS) poses a threat to global wheat production because most currently grown wheat varieties are susceptible. In this study, we evaluated a durum wheat-Aegilops speltoides chromosome translocation line (DAS15) for reaction to Ug99 and six other races of stem rust, and used molecular and cytogenetic tools to characterize the translocation. DAS15 was resistant to all seven races of stem rust. Two durum-Ae. speltoides translocated chromosomes were detected in DAS15. One translocation involved the short arm, centromere, and a major portion of the long arm of Ae. speltoides chromosome 2S and a small terminal segment from durum chromosome arm 2BL. Thus, this translocated chromosome is designated T2BL-2SL*2SS. Cytogenetic mapping assigned the resistance gene(s) in DAS15 to the Ae. speltoides segment in T2BL-2SL*2SS. The Ae. speltoides segment in the other translocated chromosome did not harbour stem rust resistance. A comparison of DAS15 and the wheat stocks carrying the Ae. speltoides-derived resistance genes Sr32 and Sr39 indicated that stem rust resistance gene present in DAS15 is likely novel and will be useful for developing germplasm with resistance to Ug99. Efforts to reduce Ae. speltoides chromatin in T2BL-2SL*2SS are currently in progress."
"17952400","articletitle","Identification of a candidate gene for the wheat endopeptidase Ep-D1 locus and two other STS markers linked to the eyespot resistance gene Pch1."
"17952400","abstracttext","Wheat is prone to strawbreaker foot rot (eyespot), a fungal disease caused by Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis. The most effective source of genetic resistance is Pch1, a gene derived from Aegilops ventricosa. The endopeptidase isozyme marker allele Ep-D1b, linked to Pch1, has been shown to be more effective for tracking resistance than DNA-based markers developed to date. Therefore, we sought to identify a candidate gene for Ep-D1 as a basis for a DNA-based marker. Comparative mapping suggested that the endopeptidase loci Ep-D1 (wheat), enp1 (maize), and Enp (rice) were orthologous. Since the product of the maize endopeptidase locus enp1 has been shown to exhibit biochemical properties similar to oligopeptidase B purified from E. coli, we reasoned that Ep-D1 may also encode an oligopeptidase B. Consistent with this hypothesis, a sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker, Xorw1, derived from an oligopeptidase B-encoding wheat expressed-sequence-tag (EST) showed complete linkage with Ep-D1 and Pch1 in a population of 254 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between wheat cultivars Coda and Brundage. Two other STS markers, Xorw5 and Xorw6, and three microsatellite markers (Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175) were also completely linked to Pch1. On the other hand, Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175 showed recombination in the W7984 x Opata85 RIL population suggesting that recombination near Pch1 is reduced in the Coda/Brundage population. In a panel of 44 wheat varieties with known eyespot reactions, Xorw1, Xorw5, and Xorw6 were 100% accurate in predicting the presence or absence of Pch1 whereas Xwmc14, Xbarc97, and Xcfd175 were less effective. Thus, linkage mapping and a germplasm survey suggest that the STS markers identified here should be useful for indirect selection of Pch1."

"20349142","abstracttext","Members of the family of 70-kD heat shock proteins (HSP70 s) play various stress-protective roles in plants. In this study, a wheat HSP70 gene was isolated from a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library of wheat leaves infected by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. The gene, that was designated as TaHSC70, was predicted to encode a protein of 690 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 73.54 KDa and a pI of 5.01. Further analysis revealed the presence of a conserved signature that is characteristic for HSP70s and phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that TaHSC70 is a homolog of chloroplast HSP70s. TaHSC70 mRNA was present in leaves of both green and etiolated wheat seedlings and in stems and roots. The transcript level in roots was approximately threefold less than in leaves but light-dark treatment did not charge TaHSC70 expression. Following heat shock of wheat seedlings at 40°C, TaHSC70 expression increased in leaves of etiolated seedlings but remained stable at the same level in green seedlings. In addition, TaHSC70 was differentially expressed during an incompatible and compatible interaction with wheat-stripe rust, and there was a transient increase in expression upon treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Salicylic acid (SA), ethylene (ET) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments had no influence on TaHSC70 expression. These results suggest that TaHSC70 plays a role in stress-related responses, and in defense responses elicited by infection with stripe rust fungus and does so via a JA-dependent signal transduction pathway."

"21917144","abstracttext_background","The ability of grass species to adapt to various habitats is attributed to the dynamic nature of their genomes, which have been shaped by multiple rounds of ancient and recent polyploidization. To gain a better understanding of the nature and extent of variation in functionally relevant regions of a polyploid genome, we developed a sequence capture assay to compare exonic sequences of allotetraploid wheat accessions."
"21917144","abstracttext_results","A sequence capture assay was designed for the targeted re-sequencing of 3.5 Mb exon regions that surveyed a total of 3,497 genes from allotetraploid wheat. These data were used to describe SNPs, copy number variation and homoeologous sequence divergence in coding regions. A procedure for variant discovery in the polyploid genome was developed and experimentally validated. About 1% and 24% of discovered SNPs were loss-of-function and non-synonymous mutations, respectively. Under-representation of replacement mutations was identified in several groups of genes involved in translation and metabolism. Gene duplications were predominant in a cultivated wheat accession, while more gene deletions than duplications were identified in wild wheat."
"21917144","abstracttext_conclusions","We demonstrate that, even though the level of sequence similarity between targeted polyploid genomes and capture baits can bias enrichment efficiency, exon capture is a powerful approach for variant discovery in polyploids. Our results suggest that allopolyploid wheat can accumulate new variation in coding regions at a high rate. This process has the potential to broaden functional diversity and generate new phenotypic variation that eventually can play a critical role in the origin of new adaptations and important agronomic traits."

"22672647","abstracttext_background","As the global population continues to expand, increasing yield in bread wheat is of critical importance as 20% of the world's food supply is sourced from this cereal. Several recent studies of the molecular basis of grain yield indicate that the cytokinins are a key factor in determining grain yield. In this study, cytokinin gene family members in bread wheat were isolated from four multigene families which regulate cytokinin synthesis and metabolism, the isopentenyl transferases (IPT), cytokinin oxidases (CKX), zeatin O-glucosyltransferases (ZOG), and β-glucosidases (GLU). As bread wheat is hexaploid, each gene family is also likely to be represented on the A, B and D genomes. By using a novel strategy of qRT-PCR with locus-specific primers shared among the three homoeologues of each family member, detailed expression profiles are provided of family members of these multigene families expressed during leaf, spike and seed development."
"22672647","abstracttext_results","The expression patterns of individual members of the IPT, CKX, ZOG, and GLU multigene families in wheat are shown to be tissue- and developmentally-specific. For instance, TaIPT2 and TaCKX1 were the most highly expressed family members during early seed development, with relative expression levels of up to 90- and 900-fold higher, respectively, than those in the lowest expressed samples. The expression of two cis-ZOG genes was sharply increased in older leaves, while an extremely high mRNA level of TaGLU1-1 was detected in young leaves."

"23007977","articletitle","Monosomic and molecular mapping of adult plant leaf rust resistance genes in the Brazilian wheat cultivar Toropi."
"23007977","abstracttext","Leaf rust is one of the most destructive diseases affecting wheat worldwide. The most effective way to control it is to use resistant cultivars. Resistance based on slow-rusting adult plant resistance (APR) genes has proven to be the best method for developing cultivars with durable resistance. A source of slow-rusting APR for leaf rust is the Brazilian wheat cultivar Toropi. The Toropi/IAC 13 F₂ and F₇ recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed in previous studies. Phenotypic analysis of the F₂ and F₇ RILs showed that 2 recessive genes that were temporarily named trp-1 and trp-2 conferred APR in Toropi. In the present study, we used monosomic families and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), sequence-tagged site, and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to map trp-1 and trp-2 on wheat chromosomes. Analysis of the F₂ monosomic RIL showed that trp- 1 and trp-2 were located on chromosomes 1A and 4D, respectively. AFLP analysis of the F₇ RIL identified 2 independent AFLP markers, XPacgMcac3 and XPacgMcac6, which were associated with Toropi APR. These markers explained 71.5% of the variation in the phenotypic data in a multiple linear regression model. The AFLP markers XPacg/ Mcac3 and XPacg/Mcac6 were anchored by SSR markers previously mapped on the short arms of chromosomes 1A (1AS) and 4D (4DS), respectively. The trp-2 gene is the first leaf rust resistance gene mapped on wheat chromosome 4DS. The mapping of trp-1 and trp-2 provides novel and valuable information that could be used in future studies involving the fine mapping of these genes, as well as in the identification of molecular markers that are closely related to these genes for marker-assisted selection of this important trait in wheat."

"22864927","abstracttext","Fructans are soluble carbohydrates with health benefits and possible roles in plant adaptation. Fructan biosynthetic genes were isolated using comparative genomics and physical mapping followed by BAC sequencing in barley. Genes encoding sucrose:sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST), fructan:fructan 1-fructosyltransferase (1-FFT) and sucrose:fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) were clustered together with multiple copies of vacuolar invertase genes and a transposable element on two barley BAC. Intron-exon structures of the genes were similar. Phylogenetic analysis of the fructosyltransferases and invertases in the Poaceae showed that the fructan biosynthetic genes may have evolved from vacuolar invertases. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed using leaf RNA extracted from three wheat cultivars grown under different conditions. The 1-SST, 1-FFT and 6-SFT genes had correlated expression patterns in our wheat experiment and in existing barley transcriptome database. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were developed and successfully mapped to a major QTL region affecting wheat grain fructan accumulation in two independent wheat populations. The alleles controlling high- and low- fructan in parental lines were also found to be associated in fructan production in a diverse set of 128 wheat lines. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on the mapping and sequencing of a fructan biosynthetic gene cluster and in particular, the isolation of a novel 1-FFT gene from barley."

"22067038","abstracttext","Over two billion people, depending largely on staple foods, suffer from deficiencies in protein and some micronutrients such as iron and zinc. Among various approaches to overcome protein and micronutrient deficiencies, biofortification through a combination of conventional and molecular breeding methods is the most feasible, cheapest, and sustainable approach. An interspecific cross was made between the wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring' and Aegilops kotschyi Boiss. accession 396, which has a threefold higher grain iron and zinc concentrations and about 33% higher protein concentration than wheat cultivars. Recurrent backcrossing and selection for the micronutrient content was performed at each generation. Thirteen derivatives with high grain iron and zinc concentrations and contents, ash and ash micronutrients, and protein were analyzed for alien introgression. Morphological markers, high molecular weight glutenin subunit profiles, anchored wheat microsatellite markers, and GISH showed that addition and substitution of homoeologous groups 1, 2, and 7 chromosomes of Ae. kotschyi possess gene(s) for high grain micronutrients. The addition of 1U/1S had high molecular weight glutenin subunits with higher molecular weight than those of wheat, and the addition of 2S in most of the derivatives also enhanced grain protein content by over 20%. Low grain protein content in a derivative with a 2S-wheat translocation, waxy leaves, and absence of the gdm148 marker strongly suggests that the gene for higher grain protein content on chromosome 2S is orthologous to the grain protein QTL on the short arm of group 2 chromosomes."

"21242535","abstracttext","Chromosome engineering is a useful strategy for transfer of alien genes from wild relatives into modern crops. However, this strategy has not been extensively used for alien gene introgression in most crops due to low efficiency of conventional cytogenetic techniques. Here, we report an improved scheme of chromosome engineering for efficient elimination of a large amount of goatgrass (Aegilops speltoides) chromatin surrounding Sr39, a gene that provides resistance to multiple stem rust races, including Ug99 (TTKSK) in wheat. The wheat ph1b mutation, which promotes meiotic pairing between homoeologous chromosomes, was employed to induce recombination between wheat chromosome 2B and goatgrass 2S chromatin using a backcross scheme favorable for inducing and detecting the homoeologous recombinants with small goatgrass chromosome segments. Forty recombinants with Sr39 with reduced surrounding goatgrass chromatin were quickly identified from 1048 backcross progenies through disease screening and molecular marker analysis. Four of the recombinants carrying Sr39 with a minimal amount of goatgrass chromatin (2.87-9.15% of the translocated chromosomes) were verified using genomic in situ hybridization. Approximately 97% of the goatgrass chromatin was eliminated in one of the recombinants, in which a tiny goatgrass chromosome segment containing Sr39 was retained in the wheat genome. Localization of the goatgrass chromatin in the recombinants led to rapid development of three molecular markers tightly linked to Sr39. The new wheat lines and markers provide useful resources for the ongoing global effort to combat Ug99. This study has demonstrated great potential of chromosome engineering in genome manipulation for plant improvement."
"21344181","articletitle","Development of a new marker system for identifying the complex members of the low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit gene family in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"21344181","abstracttext","Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GSs) play an important role in determining the bread-making quality of bread wheat. However, LMW-GSs display high polymorphic protein complexes encoded by multiple genes, and elucidating the complex LMW-GS gene family in bread wheat remains challenging. In the present study, using conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with conserved primers and high-resolution capillary electrophoresis, we developed a new molecular marker system for identifying LMW-GS gene family members. Based on sequence alignment of 13 LMW-GS genes previously identified in the Chinese bread wheat variety Xiaoyan 54 and other genes available in GenBank, PCR primers were developed and assigned to conserved sequences spanning the length polymorphism regions of LMW-GS genes. After PCR amplification, 17 DNA fragments in Xiaoyan 54 were detected using capillary electrophoresis. In total, 13 fragments were identical to previously identified LMW-GS genes, and the other 4 were derived from unique LMW-GS genes by sequencing. This marker system was also used to identify LMW-GS genes in Chinese Spring and its group 1 nulli-tetrasomic lines. Among the 17 detected DNA fragments, 4 were located on chromosome 1A, 5 on 1B, and 8 on 1D. The results suggest that this marker system is useful for large-scale identification of LMW-GS genes in bread wheat varieties, and for the selection of desirable LMW-GS genes to improve the bread-making quality in wheat molecular breeding programmes."

"23160639","abstracttext","KEY MESSAGE : Wheat genes differentially expressed in the egg cell before and after fertilization were identified. The data support zygotic gene activation before the first cell division in wheat. To have an insight into fertilization-induced gene expression, cDNA libraries have been prepared from isolated wheat egg cells and one-celled zygotes. Two-hundred and twenty-six egg cell and 253 zygote-expressed EST sequences were determined. Most of the represented transcripts were detected in the wheat egg cell or zygote transcriptome at the first time. Expression analysis of fourteen of the identified genes and three controls was carried out by real-time quantitative PCR. The preferential expression of all investigated genes in the female gametophyte-derived samples (egg cells, zygotes, two-celled proembryos, and basal ovule parts with synergids) in comparison to the anthers, and the leaves were verified. Three genes with putative signaling/regulatory functions were expressed at a low level in the egg cell but exhibited increased (2-to-33-fold) relative expression in the zygote and the proembryo. Genes with high EST abundance in cDNA libraries exhibited strong expression in the egg cell and the zygote, while the ones coding for unknown or hypothetical proteins exhibited differential expression patterns with preferential transcript accumulation in egg cells and/or zygotes. The obtained data support the activation of the zygotic genome before the first cell division in wheat."

"23107922","abstracttext","Worldwide germplasm collections contain about 7.4 million accessions of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture. One of the 10 largest ex situ genebanks of our globe is located at the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research in Gatersleben, Germany. Molecular tools have been used for various gene bank management practices including characterization and utilization of the germplasm. The results on genetic integrity of longterm- stored gene bank accessions of wheat (self-pollinating) and rye (open-pollinating) cereal crops revealed a high degree of identity for wheat. In contrast, the out-pollinating accessions of rye exhibited shifts in allele frequencies. The genetic diversity of wheat and barley germplasm collected at intervals of 40 to 50 years in comparable geographical regions showed qualitative rather than a quantitative change in diversity. The inter- and intraspecific variation of seed longevity was analysed and differences were detected. Genetic studies in barley, wheat and oilseed rape revealed numerous QTL, indicating the complex and quantitative nature of seed longevity. Some of the loci identified were in genomic regions that co-localize with genes determining agronomic traits such as spike architecture or biotic and abiotic stress response. Finally, a genome-wide association mapping analysis of a core collection of wheat for flowering time was performed using diversity array technology (DArT) markers. Maker trait associations were detected in genomic regions where major genes or QTL have been described earlier. In addition, new loci were also detected, providing opportunities to monitor genetic variation for crop improvement."

"23117416","abstracttext","To identify novel components of basal resistance against the Tellitia indica of wheat, breeding for disease resistance was carried out on resistant and susceptible genotype of Karnal Bunt. The different members of wheat cystatin gene families were cloned, and their role in triggering differential resistance through co-expression was analyzed in our lab. The multidomain wheat cystatin (WCM) is a proteinase inhibitor characterized by cloning the gene from susceptible (WH542) and resistant genotype (HD 29). A WCM cDNA was isolated from both genotypes and sequenced. The WCM had a highly conserved N-terminal cystatin domain and a long C-terminal extension containing a second region, which exhibited similarity to the cystatin domain. The expression level was significantly (P > 0.001) higher in resistant compared to susceptible genotype at all the physiological stages of wheat spikes. In order to characterize the biochemical properties of WCM, the coding sequence was expressed in Escherichia coli using pET expression vector. The recombinant WCM was purified from soluble fraction of the cell extract by using affinity chromatography. WCM, with 23 KDa molecular mass, showed cysteine proteinase inhibitory activity against papain (Ki 3.039 × 10(-7) M) as determined by using BAPNA as substrate. Furthermore, it was able to arrest the fungal mycelial growth of T. indica. Hyphae growth was inhibited, and morphological changes such as swelling and fragmentation of the fungus were observed. Overall, these observations suggest an endogenous high expression of cystatin, possibly associated with the resistance of wheat against Karnal bunt."

"23630259","abstracttext","Domesticated crops experience strong human-mediated selection aimed at developing high-yielding varieties adapted to local conditions. To detect regions of the wheat genome subject to selection during improvement, we developed a high-throughput array to interrogate 9,000 gene-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in a worldwide sample of 2,994 accessions of hexaploid wheat including landraces and modern cultivars. Using a SNP-based diversity map we characterized the impact of crop improvement on genomic and geographic patterns of genetic diversity. We found evidence of a small population bottleneck and extensive use of ancestral variation often traceable to founders of cultivars from diverse geographic regions. Analyzing genetic differentiation among populations and the extent of haplotype sharing, we identified allelic variants subjected to selection during improvement. Selective sweeps were found around genes involved in the regulation of flowering time and phenology. An introgression of a wild relative-derived gene conferring resistance to a fungal pathogen was detected by haplotype-based analysis. Comparing selective sweeps identified in different populations, we show that selection likely acts on distinct targets or multiple functionally equivalent alleles in different portions of the geographic range of wheat. The majority of the selected alleles were present at low frequency in local populations, suggesting either weak selection pressure or temporal variation in the targets of directional selection during breeding probably associated with changing agricultural practices or environmental conditions. The developed SNP chip and map of genetic variation provide a resource for advancing wheat breeding and supporting future population genomic and genome-wide association studies in wheat."

"23665893","abstracttext","Plants live in a complex environment, exposed to stresses, such as unsuitable climates, pests and pathogenic microorganisms. Pathogens are one of the most serious factors that threaten plant growth. Wheat stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive diseases worldwide. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a popular tool for the functional analysis of wheat genes, generating abundant small RNAs (sRNAs). sRNAs are key components in gene regulatory networks, silencing corresponding genes at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we transduced pri-tae-miR159a into plant tissues using the barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) system, and demonstrated that vsiRNAs were generated from the same miRNAs generating sites of pri-tae-miR159a, with the function of Dicer RNase III-like classes of endonucleases (DCL4). In addition, the accumulation of vsiRNAs in wheat leaves challenged with Pst Chinese yellow rust 23 (CYR23), resulted in a resistant phenotype, and in the compatible interaction, the sporation of Pst was limited. Whereas, infection with a control construct had no effect on the resistance or susceptibility. The results of the histological observation also supported these phenotype changes. Interestingly, vsiRNAs were also involved in the interactions between wheat and Pst through the tae-miR159-mediated regulation of taMyb3 expression. Moreover, these results also supported the speculation that vsiRNAs were generated from the same sites of pri-tae-miR159a. These studies indicated that vsiRNAs from miRNAs generating sites of pri-tae-miR159a based on the BSMV system play positive roles in the wheat response to Pst through the regulation of taMyb3 expression."

"23918959","abstracttext","Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CPKs) are important Ca2+ signalling components involved in complex immune and stress signalling networks; but the knowledge of CPK gene functions in the hexaploid wheat is limited. Previously, TaCPK2 was shown to be inducible by powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis tritici, Bgt) infection in wheat. Here, its functions in disease resistance are characterized further. This study shows the presence of defence-response and cold-response cis-elements on the promoters of the A subgenome homoeologue (TaCPK2-A) and D subgenome homoeologue (TaCPK2-D), respectively. Their expression patterns were then confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) using genome-specific primers, where TaCPK2-A was induced by Bgt treatment while TaCPK2-D mainly responded to cold treatment. Downregulation of TaCPK2-A by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) causes loss of resistance to Bgt in resistant wheat lines, indicating that TaCPK2-A is required for powdery mildew resistance. Furthermore, overexpression of TaCPK2-A in rice enhanced bacterial blight (Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae, Xoo) resistance. qRT-PCR analysis showed that overexpression of TaCPK2-A in rice promoted the expression of OsWRKY45-1, a transcription factor involved in both fungal and bacterial resistance by regulating jasmonic acid and salicylic acid signalling genes. The opposite effect was found in wheat TaCPK2-A VIGS plants, where the homologue of OsWRKY45-1 was significantly repressed. These data suggest that modulation of WRKY45-1 and associated defence-response genes by CPK2 genes may be the common mechanism for multiple disease resistance in grass species, which may have undergone subfunctionalization in promoters before the formation of hexaploid wheat."

"24202523","abstracttext","Three different 3' noncoding sequences of wheat rubisco small subunit (SSU) genes (RbcS) were used as probes to identify the gene members of different RbcS subfamilies in the common wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS). All genes of the wheat RbcS multigene family were previously assigned to the long arm of homoeologous group 5 and to the short arm of homoeologous group 2 chromosomes of cv CS. Extracted DNA from various aneuploids of these homoeologous groups was digested with four restriction enzymes and hybridized with three different 3' noncoding sequences of wheat SSU clones. All RbcS genes located on the long arm of homoeologous group 5 chromosomes were found to comprise a single subfamily, while those located on the short arm of group 2 comprised three subfamilies. Each of the ancestral diploid genomes A, B, and D has at least one representative gene in each subfamily, suggesting that the divergence into subfamilies preceded the differentiation into species. This divergence of the RbcS genes, which is presumably accompanied by a similar divergence in the 5' region, may lead to differential expression of various subfamilies in different tissues and in different developmental stages, in response to different environmental conditions. Moreover, members of one subfamily that belong to different genomes may have diverged also in the coding sequence and, consequently, code for distinguishable SSU. It is assumed that such utilization of the RbcS multigene family increases the adaptability and phenotypic plasticity of common wheat over its diploid progenitors."

"26287740","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is one of the most devastating wheat fungal diseases. A diploid wheat relative, Haynaldia villosa L., is highly resistant to powdery mildew, and its genetic resource of resistances, such as the Pm21 locus, is now widely used in wheat breeding. Here we report the cloning of a resistance gene from H. villosa, designated CMPG1-V, that encodes a U-box E3 ubiquitin ligase. Expression of the CMPG1-V gene was induced in the leaf and stem of H. villosa upon inoculation with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) fungus, and the presence of Pm21 is essential for its rapid induction of expression. CMPG1-V has conserved key residues for E3 ligase, and possesses E3 ligase activity in vitro and in vivo. CMPG1-V is localized in the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane and partially in trans-Golgi network/early endosome vesicles. Transgenic wheat over-expressing CMPG1-V showed improved broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance at seedling and adult stages, associated with an increase in expression of salicylic acid-responsive genes, H2 O2 accumulation, and cell-wall protein cross-linking at the Bgt infection sites, and the expression of CMPG1-V in H. villosa was increased when treated with salicylic acid, abscisic acid and H2 O2 . These results indicate the involvement of E3 ligase in defense responses to Bgt fungus in wheat, particularly in broad-spectrum disease resistance, and suggest association of reactive oxidative species and the phytohormone pathway with CMPG1-V-mediated powdery mildew resistance."

TEs have been mostly silent for the last one million years, and the 3B chromosome has been shaped by a succession of bursts that occurred between 1 to 3 million years ago. Accelerated TE elimination in the high-recombination distal regions is a driving force towards chromosome partitioning. CACTAs overrepresented in the high-recombination distal regions are significantly associated with recently duplicated genes. In addition, we identify 140 CACTA-mediated gene capture events with 17 genes potentially created by exon shuffling and show that 19 captured genes are transcribed and under selection pressure, suggesting the important role of CACTAs in the recent wheat adaptation."

"25893867","abstracttext_main conclusion","TraeALDH7B1 - 5A , encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase 7 in wheat, conferred significant drought tolerance to Arabidopsis , supported by molecular biological and physiological experiments. Drought stress significantly affects wheat yields. Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) is a family of enzymes catalyzing the irreversible conversion of aldehydes into acids to decrease the damage caused by abiotic stresses. However, no wheat ALDH member has been functionally characterized to date. Here, we obtained a differentially expressed EST encoding ALDH7 from a cDNA-AFLP library of wheat that was treated with polyethylene glycol 6000. The three full-length homologs of TraeALDH7B1 were isolated by searching the NCBI database and by homolog-based cloning method. Using nulli-tetrasomic lines we located them on wheat chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D, and named them as TraeALDH7B1-5A, -5B and -5D, respectively. Gene expression profiles indicated that the expressions of all three genes were induced in roots, leaves, culms and spikelets under drought and salt stresses. Enzymatic activity analysis showed that TraeALDH7B1-5A had acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity. For further functional analysis, we developed transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing TraeALDH7B1-5A driven by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Compared with wild type Arabidopsis, 35S::TraeALDH7B1-5A plants significantly enhanced the tolerance to drought stress, which was demonstrated by up-regulation of stress responsive genes and physiological evidence of primary root length, maintenance of water retention and contents of chlorophyll and MDA. The combined results indicated that TraeALDH7B1-5A is an important drought responsive gene for genetic transformation to improve drought tolerance in crops."

"25516153","abstracttext","Flow cytometric sorting of individual chromosomes and chromosome-based sequencing reduces the complexity of large, repetitive Triticeae genomes. We flow-sorted chromosome 5D of Aegilops tauschii, the D genome donor of bread wheat and sequenced it by Roche 454 GS FLX platform to approximately 2.2x coverage. Repetitive sequences represent 81.09% of the survey sequences of this chromosome, and Class I retroelements are the prominent type, with a particular abundance of LTR/Gypsy superfamily. Nonrepetitive sequences were assembled to cover 17.76% of the total chromosome regions. Up to 6188 nonrepetitive gene loci were predicted to be encoded by the 5D chromosome. The numbers and chromosomal distribution patterns of tRNA genes suggest abundance in tRNA(L) (ys) and tRNA(M) (et) species, while the nonrepetitive assembly reveals tRNA(A) (la) species as the most abundant type. A comparative analysis of the genomic sequences of bread wheat and Aegilops chromosome 5D indicates conservation of gene content. Orthologous unique genes, matching Aegilops 5D sequences, numbered 3730 in barley, 5063 in Brachypodium, 4872 in sorghum and 4209 in rice. In this study, we provide a chromosome-specific view into the structure and organization of the 5D chromosome of Ae. tauschii, the D genome ancestor of bread wheat. This study contributes to our understanding of the chromosome-level evolution of the wheat genome and presents a valuable resource in wheat genomics due to the recent hybridization of Ae. tauschii genome with its tetraploid ancestor."

"25982130","abstracttext_key message","Selection for QLr.cau - 1AS (a major QTL detected in wheat for reducing leaf rust severity) based on the DNA marker gpw2246 was as effective as selection for Lr34 based on cssfr5. Leaf rust is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Utilization of slow-rusting resistance constitutes a strategy to sustainably control this disease. The American wheat cultivar Luke exhibits slow leaf-rusting resistance at the adult plant stage. The objectives of this study were to detect and validate QTL for the resistance in Luke. Three winter wheat populations were used, namely, 149 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross Luke × Aquileja, 307 RILs from Luke × AQ24788-83, and 80 F2:3 families selected from Lingxing66 × KA298. Aquileja and Lingxing66 are highly susceptible to leaf rust. AQ24788-83 shows high (susceptible) infection type but contains the slow-rusting gene Lr34 as diagnosed by the gene-specific marker cssfr5. KA298, an F9 RIL selected from Luke × AQ24788-83, contains Lr34 and QLr.cau-1AS (a major QTL originated from Luke, this study). These wheats were evaluated for leaf rust in 12 field and greenhouse environments involving four locations and five seasons. Genotyping was done using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and diversity arrays technology markers. Of the detected QTLs, QLr.cau-1AS was significant consistently across all the genetic backgrounds, test environments, and likely a wide range of pathogen races. QLr.cau-1AS explained 22.3-55.2% of leaf rust phenotypic variation, being comparable to Lr34 in effect size. A co-dominant SSR marker (gpw2246, http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml ) was identified to be tightly linked to QLr.cau-1AS. Selection based on gpw2246 for QLr.cau-1AS was as effective as the selection based on cssfr5 for Lr34. QLr.cau-1AS will be helpful for increasing the genetic diversity of slow leaf-rusting resistance in wheat breeding programs."

"26076351","abstracttext","TaGW2 is an orthologue of rice gene OsGW2, which encodes E3 RING ubiquitin ligase and controls the grain size in rice. In wheat, three copies of TaGW2 have been identified and mapped on wheat homoeologous group 6 viz. TaGW2-6A, TaGW2-6B and TaGW2-6D. In the present study, using as many as 207 Indian wheat genotypes, we identified four SNPs including two novel SNPs (SNP-988 and SNP-494) in the promoter sequence of TaGW2-6A. All the four SNPs were G/A or A/G substitutions (transitions). Out of the four SNPs, SNP-494 was causal, since it was found associated with grain weight. The mean TGW (41.1 g) of genotypes with the allele SNP-494_A was significantly higher than mean TGW (38.6 g) of genotypes with the allele SNP-494_G. SNP-494 also regulates the expression of TaGW2-6A so that the wheat genotypes with SNP-494_G have higher expression and lower TGW and the genotypes with SNP-494_A have lower expression but higher TGW. Besides, SNP-494 was also found associated with grain length-width ratio, awn length, spike length, grain protein content, peduncle length and plant height. This suggested that gene TaGW2-6A not only controls grain size, but also controls other agronomic traits. In the promoter region, SNP-494 was present in 'CGCG' motif that plays an important role in Ca2+/calmodulin mediated regulation of genes. A user-friendly CAPS marker was also developed to identify the desirable allele of causal SNP (SNP-494) for use in marker-assisted selection for improvement of grain weight in wheat. Using four SNPs, five haplotypes were identified; of these, Hap_5 (G_A_G_A) was found to be a desirable haplotype having significantly higher grain weight (41.13g) relative to other four haplotypes (36.33-39.16 g)."

"26883047","abstracttext_key message","We cloned TaSST genes, developed a gene-specific marker for TaSST-D1, and identified three QTL in the Doumai/Shi 4185 RIL population. TaSST-D1 is within one of the three QTL. Sucrose:sucrose-1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST), a critical enzyme in the fructan biosynthetic pathway, is significantly and positively associated with water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content in bread wheat stems. In the present study, wheat 1-SST genes (TaSST) were isolated and located on chromosomes 4A, 7A and 7D. Sequence analysis of TaSST-D1 revealed 15 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the third exon between cultivars with higher and lower WSC content. A cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) marker, WSC7D, based on the polymorphism at position 1216 (C-G) was developed to discriminate the two alleles. WSC7D was located on chromosome 7DS using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from a Doumai/Shi 4185 cross, and a set of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. TaSST-D1 co-segregated with the CAPS marker WSC7D and was linked to SNP marker BS00108793_51 on chromosome 7DS at a genetic distance of 6.1 cM. It explained 8.8, 10.9, and 11.3% of the phenotypic variances in trials at Beijing and Shijiazhuang as well as the averaged data from those environments, respectively. Two additional QTL (QWSC.caas-4BS and QWSC.caas-7AS) besides TaSST-D1 were mapped in the RIL population. One hundred and forty-nine Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines tested in four environments were used to validate a highly significant (P < 0.01) association between WSC7D and WSC content in wheat stems. WSC7D can be used as a gene-specific marker for improvement of stem WSC content in wheat breeding programs."

"26745394","abstracttext","Cadmium (Cd) is a health threat all over the world and high Cd content in wheat causes high Cd intake. Silicon (Si) decreases cadmium content in wheat grains and shoot. This work investigates whether and how silicate (Si) influences cadmium (Cd) uptake at the cellular level in wheat. Wheat seedlings were grown in the presence or absence of Si with or without Cd. Cadmium, Si, and iron (Fe) accumulation in roots and shoots was analysed. Leaf protoplasts from plants grown without Cd were investigated for Cd uptake in the presence or absence of Si using the fluorescent dye, Leadmium Green AM. Roots and shoots of plants subjected to all four treatments were investigated regarding the expression of genes involved in the Cd uptake across the plasma membrane (i.e. LCT1) and efflux of Cd into apoplasm or vacuole from the cytosol (i.e. HMA2). In addition, phytochelatin (PC) content and PC gene (PCS1) expression were analysed. Expression of iron and metal transporter genes (IRT1 and NRAMP1) were also analysed. Results indicated that Si reduced Cd accumulation in plants, especially in shoot. Si reduced Cd transport into the cytoplasm when Si was added both directly during the uptake measurements and to the growth medium. Silicate downregulated LCT1 and HMA2 and upregulated PCS1. In addition, Si enhanced PC formation when Cd was present. The IRT1 gene, which was downregulated by Cd was upregulated by Si in root and shoot facilitating Fe transport in wheat. NRAMP1 was similarly expressed, though the effect was limited to roots. This work is the first to show how Si influences Cd uptake on the cellular level."

"26705106","abstracttext_background","For functional genomics studies, it is important to understand the dynamic expression profiles of transcribed genes in different tissues, stages of development and in response to environmental stimuli. The proliferation in the use of next-generation sequencing technologies by the plant research community has led to the accumulation of large volumes of expression data. However, analysis of these datasets is complicated by the frequent occurrence of polyploidy among economically-important crop species. In addition, processing and analyzing such large volumes of sequence data is a technical and time-consuming task, limiting their application in functional genomics studies, particularly for smaller laboratories which lack access to high-powered computing infrastructure. Wheat is a good example of a young polyploid species with three similar genomes (97 % identical among homoeologous genes), rapidly accumulating RNA-seq datasets and a large research community."
"26705106","abstracttext_description","We present WheatExp, an expression database and visualization tool to analyze and compare homoeologue-specific transcript profiles across a broad range of tissues from different developmental stages in polyploid wheat.

Data from multiple studies is processed and compiled into a database which can be queried either by BLAST or by searching for a known gene of interest by name or functional domain. Expression data of multiple genes can be displayed side-by-side across all expression datasets providing immediate access to a comprehensive panel of expression data for specific subsets of wheat genes."

The presented expression data is homoeologue-specific allowing for the analysis of relative contributions from each genome to the overall expression of a gene, a critical consideration for breeding applications. Our approach can be expanded to other polyploid species by adjusting sequence mapping parameters according to the specific divergence of their genomes."
"26386259","articletitle","Down-regulation of a wheat alkaline/neutral invertase correlates with reduced host susceptibility to wheat stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis."
"26386259","abstracttext","Numerous studies have found that sucrose (Suc) metabolism plays a crucial role in the environmental stress response of many plant species. The majority of Suc metabolism-associated reports refer to acid invertases (Ac-Invs). However, alkaline/neutral Invs (A/N-Invs) have been poorly studied. In this study, a wheat A/N-Inv gene, Ta-A/N-Inv1, with three copies located on chromosomes 4A, 4B, and 4D, was cloned from a wheat-Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) interaction cDNA library. Transcripts of the three Ta-A/N-Inv1 copies were up-regulated in wheat leaves that were infected by Pst or had experienced certain abiotic treatments. Furthermore, the expression of Ta-A/N-Inv1 was decreased by treatment with exogenous hormones. Heterologous mutant complementation and subcellular localization revealed that Ta-A/N-Inv1 is a cytoplasmic invertase. Knocking down all three copies of Ta-A/N-Inv1 using the barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing system reduced the susceptibility of wheat to the Pst virulent pathotype CYR31, which is associated with pathogen-induced H2O2 accumulation and enhanced necrosis. Interestingly, 48h dark treatment of the Ta-A/N-Inv1-knockdown plants immediately after inoculation abrogated their enhanced resistance, suggesting that H2O2 production and its associated cell death and resistance in the Ta-A/N-Inv1-silenced plants require light. Consistent with this observation, photosynthesis and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes were significantly up-regulated in the Ta-A/N-Inv1-knockdown plants infected by CYR31 under light exposure. These results suggest that Ta-A/N-Inv1 might act as a negative regulator in wheat disease resistance to Pst by increasing cytoplasmic hexose accumulation and downregulating photosynthesis of the leaves to avoid cell death due to excessive ROS production."

"26691455","abstracttext","A total of 48 endophytic bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized tissues of the medicinal plant Lonicera japonica, which is grown in eastern China; six strains were selected for further study based on their potential ability to promote plant growth in vitro (siderophore and indoleacetic acid production). The bacteria were characterized by phylogenetically analyzing their 16S rRNA gene similarity, by examining their effect on the mycelial development of pathogenic fungi, by testing their potential plant growth-promoting characteristics, and by measuring wheat growth parameters after inoculation. Results showed that the number of endophytic bacteria in L. japonica varied among different tissues, but it remained relatively stable in the same tissues from four different plantation locations. Among the three endophytic strains, strains 122 and 124 both had high siderophore production, with the latter showing the highest phosphate solubilization activity (45.6 mg/L) and aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase activity (47.3 nmol/mg/h). Strain 170 had the highest indoleacetic acid (IAA) production (49.2 mg/L) and cellulase and pectinase activities. After inoculation, most of the six selected isolates showed a strong capacity to promote wheat growth. Compared with the controls, the increase in the shoot length, root length, fresh weight, dry weight, and chlorophyll content was most remarkable in wheat seedlings inoculated with strain 130. The positive correlation between enzyme (cellulose and pectinase) activity and inhibition rate on Fusarium oxysporum, the IAA production, and the root length of wheat seedlings inoculated with each tested endophytic strain was significant in regression analysis. Deformity of pathogenic fungal mycelia was observed under a microscope after the interaction with the endophytic isolates. Such deformity may be directly related to the production of hydrolytic bacterial enzymes (cellulose and pectinase). The six endophytic bacterial strains were identified to be Paenibacillus and Bacillus strains based on the results of 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and their physiological and biochemical characteristics. Results indicate the promising application of endophytic bacteria to the biological control of pathogenic fungi and the improvement of wheat crop growth."

"26834758","abstracttext","The actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in plant defense against pathogenic fungi, oomycetes, and bacteria. Actin depolymerizing factors (ADFs) are stimulus responsive actin cytoskeleton modulators. However, there is limited evidence linking ADFs with plant defense against pathogens. In this study, we have isolated and functionally characterized a stress-responsive ADF gene (TaADF3) from wheat, which was detectable in all examined wheat tissues. TaADF3 is a three-copy gene located on chromosomes 5AL, 5BL, and 5DL. A particle bombardment assay in onion epidermal cells revealed the cytoplasmic and nuclear localization of TaADF3. The expression of TaADF3 was inducible by abscisic acid (ABA), as well as various abiotic stresses (drought and cold) and virulent Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) but was down regulated in response to avirulent Pst. Virus-induced silencing of TaADF3 copies enhanced wheat resistance to avirulent Pst, with decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and hypersensitive response (HR). Upon treatment with virulent Pst, TaADF3-knockdown plants exhibited reduced susceptibility, which was accompanied by increased ROS production and HR. Interestingly, the silencing of TaADF3 resulted in hindered pathogen penetration and haustoria formation for both avirulent and virulent Pst. Moreover, the array and distribution of actin filaments was transformed in TaADF3-knockdown epidermal cells, which possibly facilitated attenuating the fungus penetration. Thus, our findings suggest that TaADF3 positively regulates wheat tolerance to abiotic stresses and negatively regulates wheat resistance to Pst in an ROS-dependent manner, possibly underlying the mechanism of impeding fungal penetration dependent on the actin architecture dynamics."

"26991894","abstracttext","Stripe rust (or yellow rust), which is caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most devastating wheat diseases worldwide. The wheat cultivar Xingzi 9104 (XZ) is an elite wheat germplasm that possesses adult plant resistance (APR), which is non-race-specific and durable. Thus, to better understand the mechanism underlying APR, we performed transcriptome sequencing of wheat seedlings and adult plants without Pst infection, and a total of 157,689 unigenes were obtained as a reference. In total, 2,666, 783 and 2,587 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be up- or down-regulated after Pst infection at 24, 48 and 120 hours post-inoculation (hpi), respectively, based on a comparison of Pst- and mock-infected plants. Among these unigenes, the temporal pattern of the up-regulated unigenes exhibited transient expression patterns during Pst infection, as determined through a Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. In addition, a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis showed that many biological processes, including phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species, photosynthesis and thiamine metabolism, which mainly control the mechanisms of lignification, reactive oxygen species and sugar, respectively, are involved in APR. In particular, the continuous accumulation of reactive oxygen species may potentially contribute to the ability of the adult plant to inhibit fungal growth and development. To validate the bioinformatics results, 6 candidate genes were selected for further functional identification using the virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system, and 4 candidate genes likely contribute to plant resistance against Pst infection. Our study provides new information concerning the transcriptional changes that occur during the Pst-wheat interaction at the adult stage and will help further our understanding of the detailed mechanisms underlying APR to Pst."
"27258471","articletitle","Wheat PR-1 proteins are targeted by necrotrophic pathogen effector proteins."
"27258471","abstracttext","Recent studies have identified that proteinaceous effectors secreted by Parastagonospora nodorum are required to cause disease on wheat. These effectors interact in a gene-for-gene manner with host-dominant susceptibilty loci, resulting in disease. However, whilst the requirement of these effectors for infection is clear, their mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. A yeast-two-hybrid library approach was used to search for wheat proteins that interacted with the necrotrophic effector SnTox3. Using this strategy we indentified an interaction between SnTox3 and the wheat pathogenicity-related protein TaPR-1-1, and confirmed it by in-planta co-immunprecipitation. PR-1 proteins represent a large family (23 in wheat) of proteins that are upregulated early in the defence response; however, their function remains ellusive. Interestingly, the P. nodorum effector SnToxA has recently been shown to interact specifically with TaPR-1-5. Our analysis of the SnTox3-TaPR-1 interaction demonstrated that SnTox3 can interact with a broader range of TaPR-1 proteins. Based on these data we utilised homology modeling to predict, and validate, regions on TaPR-1 proteins that are likely to be involved in the SnTox3 interaction. Precipitating from this work, we identified that a PR-1-derived defence signalling peptide from the C-terminus of TaPR-1-1, known as CAPE1, enhanced the infection of wheat by P. nodorum in an SnTox3-dependent manner, but played no role in ToxA-mediated disease. Collectively, our data suggest that P. nodorum has evolved unique effectors that target a common host-protein involved in host defence, albeit with different mechanisms and potentially outcomes."

Using a genetic linkage map consisting of single sequence repeats and diversity arrays technology markers, in combination with inclusive composite interval mapping analysis, we detected a new LR adult plant resistance (APR) locus, QLr.cim-2DS , contributed by UC1110. One co-located resistance locus to both rusts, QLr.cim-3DC/QYr.cim-3DC , and the known seedling resistance gene Lr26 were also mapped. QLr.cim-2DS and QLr.cim-3DC showed a marginally significant interaction for LR resistance in the adult plant stage. In addition, two previously reported YR APR loci, QYr.ucw-3BS and Yr48 , were found to exhibit stable performances in rust environments in both Mexico and the United States and showed a highly significant interaction in the field. Yr48 was also observed to confer intermediate seedling resistance against Mexican YR races, thus suggesting it should be re-classified as an all-stage resistance gene. We also identified 5 and 2 RILs that possessed all detected YR and LR resistance loci, respectively. With the closely linked molecular markers reported here, these RILs could be used as donors for multiple resistance loci to both rusts in wheat breeding programs."

The widely grown Chinese wheat cultivar Zhoumai 22 is highly resistant to the current prevailing PST race CYR34 (V26). Genetic analysis of F 5:6 and F 6:7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations indicated that adult-plant stripe rust resistance in Zhoumai 22 is controlled by a single gene, temporarily designated YrZH22. By applying bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq), 7 SNP markers were developed and SNP mapping showed that YrZH22 is located between markers WGGB105 and WGGB112 on chromosome arm 4BL. The corresponding genomic regions of the Chinese Spring 4BL genome assembly and physical map of Aegilops tauschii 4DL were selected for comparative genomics analyses to develop nine new polymorphic markers that were used to construct a high-resolution genetic linkage map of YrZH22.

Schmalh, 33 primary synthetic hexaploid wheat genotypes (SYN) were crossed to 20 spring bread wheat (BW) cultivars at the International Wheat and Maize Improvement Center. Modified single seed descent was used to develop 97 populations with 50 individuals per population using first back-cross, biparental, and three-way crosses. Individuals from each cross were selected for short stature, early heading, flowering and maturity, minimal lodging, and free threshing. Yield trials were conducted under irrigated, drought, and heat-stress conditions from 2011 to 2014 in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico. Genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) of parents and synthetic derived lines (SDLs) were estimated using a genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) model with markers in each trial. In each environment, there were SDLs that had higher GEBVs than their recurrent BW parent for yield. The GEBVs of BW parents for yield ranged from -0.32 in heat to 1.40 in irrigated trials. The range of the SYN parent GEBVs for yield was from -2.69 in the irrigated to 0.26 in the heat trials and were mostly negative across environments. The contribution of the SYN parents to improved grain yield of the SDLs was highest under heat stress, with an average GEBV for the top 10% of the SDLs of 0.55 while the weighted average GEBV of their corresponding recurrent BW parents was 0.26. Using the pedigree-based model, the accuracy of genomic prediction for yield was 0.42, 0.43, and 0.49 in the drought, heat and irrigated trials, respectively, while for the marker-based model these values were 0.43, 0.44, and 0.55. The SYN parents introduced novel diversity into the wheat gene pool. Higher GEBVs of progenies were due to introgression and retention of some positive alleles from SYN parents."

"28096351","abstracttext","Comprehensive reverse genetic resources, which have been key to understanding gene function in diploid model organisms, are missing in many polyploid crops. Young polyploid species such as wheat, which was domesticated less than 10,000 y ago, have high levels of sequence identity among subgenomes that mask the effects of recessive alleles. Such redundancy reduces the probability of selection of favorable mutations during natural or human selection, but also allows wheat to tolerate high densities of induced mutations. Here we exploited this property to sequence and catalog more than 10 million mutations in the protein-coding regions of 2,735 mutant lines of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. We detected, on average, 2,705 and 5,351 mutations per tetraploid and hexaploid line, respectively, which resulted in 35-40 mutations per kb in each population. With these mutation densities, we identified an average of 23-24 missense and truncation alleles per gene, with at least one truncation or deleterious missense mutation in more than 90% of the captured wheat genes per population. This public collection of mutant seed stocks and sequence data enables rapid identification of mutations in the different copies of the wheat genes, which can be combined to uncover previously hidden variation. Polyploidy is a central phenomenon in plant evolution, and many crop species have undergone recent genome duplication events. Therefore, the general strategy and methods developed herein can benefit other polyploid crops."

"29312156","abstracttext","Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat worldwide. Planting resistant cultivars is an effective way to control this disease, but race-specific resistance can be overcome quickly due to the rapid evolving Pst population. Studying the pathogenicity mechanisms is critical for understanding how Pst virulence changes and how to develop wheat cultivars with durable resistance to stripe rust. We re-sequenced 7 Pst isolates and included additional 7 previously sequenced isolates to represent balanced virulence/avirulence profiles for several avirulence loci in seretome analyses. We observed an uneven distribution of heterozygosity among the isolates. Secretome comparison of Pst with other rust fungi identified a large portion of species-specific secreted proteins, suggesting that they may have specific roles when interacting with the wheat host. Thirty-two effectors of Pst were identified from its secretome. We identified candidates for Avr genes corresponding to six Yr genes by correlating polymorphisms for effector genes to the virulence/avirulence profiles of the 14 Pst isolates. The putative AvYr76 was present in the avirulent isolates, but absent in the virulent isolates, suggesting that deleting the coding region of the candidate avirulence gene has produced races virulent to resistance gene Yr76 . We conclude that incorporating avirulence/virulence phenotypes into correlation analysis with variations in genomic structure and secretome, particularly presence/absence polymorphisms of effectors, is an efficient way to identify candidate Avr genes in Pst . The candidate effector genes provide a rich resource for further studies to determine the evolutionary history of Pst populations and the co-evolutionary arms race between Pst and wheat. The Avr candidates identified in this study will lead to cloning avirulence genes in Pst , which will enable us to understand molecular mechanisms underlying Pst -wheat interactions, to determine the effectiveness of resistance genes and further to develop durable resistance to stripe rust."

"29472940","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici ( Pst ) is the causal agent of stripe (yellow) rust on wheat. It seriously threatens wheat production worldwide. The obligate biotrophic fungus is highly capable of producing new virulent races that can overcome resistance. Studying the inheritance of Pst virulence using the classical genetic approach was not possible until the recent discovery of its sexual stage on barberry plants. In the present study, 127 progeny isolates were obtained by selfing a representative Chinese Yellow Rust (CYR) race, CYR32, on Berberis aggregate . The parental isolate and progeny isolates were characterized by testing them on 25 wheat lines with different Yr genes for resistance and 10 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The 127 progeny isolates were classified into 27 virulence phenotypes (VPs), and 65 multi-locus genotypes (MLGs). All progeny isolates and the parental isolate were avirulent to Yr5, Yr8, Yr10, Yr15, Yr24, Yr26, Yr32 , and YrTr1 ; but virulent to Yr1, Yr2, Yr3, Yr4, Yr25, Yr44 , and Yr76 . The VPs of the parental isolate to nine Yr genes ( Yr6, Yr7, Yr9, Yr17, Yr27, Yr28, Yr43, YrA , and YrExp2 ) and the avirulence phenotype to YrSP were found to be heterozygous. Based on the segregation of the virulence/avirulence phenotypes, we found that the VPs to Yr7, Yr28, Yr43 , and YrExp2 were controlled by a dominant gene; those to Yr6, Yr9 , and YrA ( Yr73, Yr74 ) by two dominant genes; those to Yr17 and Yr27 by one dominant and one recessive gene; and the avirulence phenotype to YrSP by two complementary dominant genes. Molecular mapping revealed the linkage of 10 virulence/avirulence genes. Comparison of the inheritance modes of the virulence/avirulence genes in this study with previous studies indicated complex interactions between virulence genes in the pathogen and resistance genes in wheat lines. The results are useful for understanding the plant-pathogen interactions and developing wheat cultivars with effective and durable resistance."

The twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-offlight/ time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) were applied to analyze the changes in protein expression profiles in responding to vernalization in leaves of wheat seedling before (0d) and after (30d) of vernalization."

The selected protein spots were identified by MALDITOF/ TOF MS. Gene ontology (GO) classification was applied to classify the functions of the differentially expressed proteins. Pathway enrichment analysis identified significantly enriched metabolic pathways or signal transduction pathways relative to the whole proteins background."
"29345567","abstracttext_results","The results of 2-DE and MALDI-TOF/TOF MS showed that among the 65 differentially expressed proteins that were successfully identified under vernalization, 30 were up-regulated whereas 35 were down-regulated after vernalization, respectively. These vernalization-responsive proteins were found to play roles in carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, photosynthesis, defense and stress-resistance and may therefore participate in many biological processes in responding to vernalization. The enhanced accumulation of proteins after vernalization, such as thiamine thiazole synthase, late embryogenesis abundant protein, and glutathione-S-transferase, probably play vital roles in the mechanisms underlying vernalization response in wheat."
"29345567","abstracttext_conclusion","Our results indicated these vernalization-responsive proteins were found to be involved in protein metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, photosynthesis, and stress resistance/ defense. The responses of plants to low temperature were very complex, involving in a wide range of cellular pathways for signal transduction, gene regulation, protein modifications, and metabolic regulation. Studying on wheat proteomic profiles in response to vernalization can improve our understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying vernalization in cereals. The results obtained in this study have provided a novel insight into the mechanisms underlying vernalization in cereal crops."

"29559984","abstracttext","Enhancement of micronutrient bioavailability is crucial to address the malnutrition in the developing countries. Various approaches employed to address the micronutrient bioavailability are showing promising signs, especially in cereal crops. Phytic acid (PA) is considered as a major antinutrient due to its ability to chelate important micronutrients and thereby restricting their bioavailability. Therefore, manipulating PA biosynthesis pathway has largely been explored to overcome the pleiotropic effect in different crop species. Recently, we reported that functional wheat inositol penta kis phosphate kinase ( TaIPK1 ) is involved in PA biosynthesis, however, the functional roles of the IPK1 gene in wheat remains elusive. In this study, RNAi-mediated gene silencing was performed for IPK1 transcripts in hexaploid wheat. Four non-segregating RNAi lines of wheat were selected for detailed study (S3-D-6-1; S6-K-3-3; S6-K-6-10 and S16-D-9-5). Homozygous transgenic RNAi lines at T 4 seeds with a decreased transcript of TaIPK1 showed 28-56% reduction of the PA. Silencing of IPK1 also resulted in increased free phosphate in mature grains. Although, no phenotypic changes in the spike was observed but, lowering of grain PA resulted in the reduced number of seeds per spikelet. The lowering of grain PA was also accompanied by a significant increase in iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) content, thereby enhancing their molar ratios (Zn:PA and Fe:PA). Overall, this work suggests that IPK1 is a promising candidate for employing genome editing tools to address the mineral accumulation in wheat grains."

"29908003","abstracttext","Recently, members of the MATE family have been implicated in aluminium (Al) tolerance by facilitating citrate efflux in plants. The aim of the present work was to perform a molecular characterisation of the MATE2 gene in bread wheat. Here, we cloned a member of the MATE gene family in bread wheat and named it TaMATE2, which showed the typical secondary structure of MATE-type transporters maintaining all the 12 transmembrane domains. Amplification in Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines revealed that TaMATE2 is located on the long arm of homoeologous group 1 chromosomes. The transcript expression of TaMATE2 homoeologues in two diverse bread wheat genotypes, Barbela 7/72/92 (Al-tolerant) and Anahuac (Al-sensitive), suggested that TaMATE2 is expressed in both root and shoot tissues of bread wheat, but mainly confined to root rather than shoot tissues. A time-course analysis of TaMATE2 homoeologue transcript expression revealed the Al responsive expression of TaMATE2 in root apices of the Al-tolerant genotype, Barbela 7/72/92. Considering the high similarity of TaMATE2 together with similar Al responsive expression pattern as of ScFRDL2 from rye and OsFRDL2 from rice, it is likely that TaMATE2 also encodes a citrate transporter. Furthermore, the TaMATE2-D homoeologue appears to be near the previously reported locus (wPt0077) on chromosome 1D for Al tolerance. In conclusion, molecular cloning of TaMATE2 homoeologues, particularly TaMATE2-D, provides a plausible candidate for Al tolerance in bread wheat that can be used for the development of more Al-tolerant cultivars in this staple crop."

"29940014","abstracttext","Wheat grains are an important source of human food but current production amounts cannot meet world needs. Environmental conditions such as high temperature (above 30°C) could affect wheat production negatively. Plants from two wheat genotypes have been subjected to two growth temperature regimes. One set has been grown at an optimum daily mean temperature of 19°C while the second set of plants has been subjected to warming at 27°C from two to 13 days after anthesis (daa). While warming did not affect mean grain number per spike, it significantly reduced other yield-related indicators such as grain width, length, volume and maximal cell numbers in the endosperm. Whole genome expression analysis identified 6,258 and 5,220 genes, respectively, whose expression was affected by temperature in the two genotypes. Co-expression analysis using WGCNA (Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis) uncovered modules (groups of co-expressed genes) associated with agronomic traits. In particular, modules enriched in genes related to nutrient reservoir and endopeptidase inhibitor activities were found to be positively associated with cell numbers in the endosperm. A hypothetical model pertaining to the effects of warming on gene expression and growth in wheat grain is proposed. Under moderately high temperature conditions, network analyses suggest a negative effect of the expression of genes related to seed storage proteins and starch biosynthesis on the grain size in wheat."

Brachypodium distachyon is a close relative of wheat and has been described as a new model species for studying of grass functional genomics. Presently, little is known about wheat and B. distachyon Trihelix genes."
"30770726","abstracttext_results","In 51 species, 2387 Trihelix genes were identified, including 80 wheat Trihelix genes and 27 B. distachyon Trihelix genes. Consistent with the results of previous studies, these genes were classified into five subfamilies: GT-1, GT-2, SIP1, GTγ, and SH4. Members of the same subfamily shared similar gene structures and common motifs. Most TaGT and BdGT genes contained many kinds of cis-elements, such as development-, stress-, and phytohormone-related cis-acting elements. Additionally, 21 randomly selected TaGT genes were mainly expressed in the roots and flowers, while the expression of 19 selected BdGT genes was constitutive. These results indicate that the roles of Trihelix genes in wheat and B. distachyon might have diversified during the evolutionary process. The expression of the most selected TaGT and BdGT genes was down-regulated when exposed to low temperatures, NaCl, ABA, and PEG, implying that TaGT and BdGT genes negatively respond to abiotic stress. On the contrary, the expression of some genes was up-regulated under heat stress."
"30770726","abstracttext_conclusions","Trihelix genes exist extensively in plants and have many functions. During the evolutionary process, this gene family expanded and their functions diversified. As a result, the expression pattern and functions of members of the same family might be different. This study lays a foundation for further functional analyses of TaGT and BdGT genes."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of different starch sources (corn, wheat, and rice) on the blood glucose level, glycogen content of liver and muscle, expression of GSK-3β and FAS mRNA, abdominal fat weight and abdominal fat deposition in broiler chickens. 2. A total of 360, one-day-old AA (Arbor Acres) broiler chickens were randomly assigned to three treatment groups, each with six replicates, consisting of 20 chickens per replicate, and fed either a corn-, wheat- or rice-based diet for 21 days. The chickens were then subdivided into groups A and B, and the chickens in these two subgroups were processed or sampled for 28 days, respectively. 3. The results indicated that post-prandial time significantly affected the glucose concentration, glycogen content in the liver and breast muscle and expression of GSK-3β and FAS mRNAs (P < 0.05). The expression of the GSK-3β gene in the chicken liver of the corn-based diet group was higher (P < 0.05) than that in the wheat-based diet group, and the expression of the FAS gene in the corn-based diet group was lower (P < 0.05) than that in the wheat-based and rice-based diet groups. Abdominal fat weight and deposition in the corn-based diet group were lower than those of the wheat-based and rice-based diet groups, but these differences were not significant (P > 0.05). 4. The results suggested that the efficiency of glucose absorption in animals might have an effect on the fat deposition efficiency in the liver and that diets with different starch sources might affect fat deposition in chickens."

"32183066","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), is a devastating fungal disease of wheat. The wild emmer gene, Yr15 ( Wtk1 ), which confers a strong broad-spectrum resistance to Pst isolates, is composed of kinase and pseudokinase domains. The analysis of 361 wild emmer accessions from a wide range of natural habitats confirms that functional Wtk1 is distributed mainly along a narrow axis from Mt. Carmel to Mt. Hermon regions, in the northern part of Israel, where environmental conditions are favorable to the onset of stripe rust. An analysis of full-length Wtk1 DNA sequences from 49 wild emmer accessions identified three haplotypes and extremely low nucleotide diversity (π = 0.00002). The sequence diversity of Wtk1 is 9.5 times lower than that of broad-spectrum partial resistance gene Yr36 (π = 0.00019), and both are in sharp contrast to the high level of nucleotide diversity previously reported for race-specific resistance genes (e.g., Lr10 and Pm3 ). However, the nonfunctional wtk1 sequences possess high level of nucleotide diversity (π = 0.07). These results may reflect the different resistance mechanisms and the different evolutionary processes that shaped these resistance genes. Yr15 was absent in 189 Chinese wheat landraces and was present in only 1.02% of the 583 tested modern Chinese wheat cultivars. These results corroborate our previous results showing that Yr15 was absent in 94% of a worldwide collection of 513 wheat cultivars, therefore indicating the importance of Yr15 in wheat stripe rust resistance breeding programs in China and elsewhere around the globe."
"32480808","articletitle","Genotypic variation in the accumulation of water soluble carbohydrates in wheat."
"32480808","abstracttext","Water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) stored in the stems and leaf sheaths of winter cereals provide an important source of assimilate for remobilisation during grain-filling. Consequently, WSC are a major contributor to wheat grain yield and grain size in all environments but especially where photosynthesis is compromised as occurs where water is limiting. Breeding programs targeting greater WSC should provide improved varieties with greater and more stable yields in stress environments. To facilitate selection for WSC, genetic and genomic approaches are being used to determine the genetic basis of - and define DNA probes for - marker-aided selection for this important drought-adaptive trait. Empirical studies have identified both WSC concentration and content to be under complex genetic control of many genes. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) for WSC have been identified in several wheat populations with individual QTL explaining small amounts of phenotypic variation, typically of less than 20%. Many of these QTL are common across multiple, genetically-unrelated wheat populations. Evaluation of gene expression in high and low WSC wheat progeny lines from a well characterised wheat population has identified significant differences in expression of genes from different gene categories. For example, high WSC progeny lines have higher levels of expression of genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and lower levels of expression of genes involved in cell wall and amino acid metabolism than low WSC lines. Genetic mapping reveals several candidate genes co-locating with QTL for WSC. In addition, expression QTL (eQTL) for selected candidate genes co-locate with WSC QTL; co-location of the genes and eQTL with WSC QTL make these genes stronger candidate genes for the WSC trait."

"29990742","abstracttext","Crop protection agents are widely used in modern agriculture and exert direct effects on non-target microorganisms such as yeasts. Yeasts abundantly colonize wheat grain and affect its chemical composition. They can also limit pathogen growth. This study evaluated the sensitivity of yeast communities colonizing winter wheat kernels to benzimidazole, strobilurin, triazole and morpholine fungicides, trinexapac-ethyl, a commercial mixture of o-nitrophenol+p-nitrophenol+5-nitroguaiacol, and chitosan applied during the growing season of winter wheat and in vitro in a diffusion test. A molecular identification analysis of yeasts isolated from winter wheat kernels was performed, and nucleotide polymorphisms in the CYTb gene (G143A) conferring resistance to strobilurin fungicides in yeast cells were identified. The size of yeast communities increased during grain storage, and the total counts of endophytic yeasts were significantly (85%) reduced following intensive fungicide treatment (fenpropimorph, a commercial mixture of pyraclostrobin, epoxiconazole and thiophanate-methyl). This study demonstrated that agrochemical residues in wheat grain can drive selection of yeast communities for reduced sensitivity to xenobiotics. A mutation in the CYTb gene (G143A) was observed in all analyzed isolates of the following azoxystrobin-resistant species: Aureobasidium pullulans, Debaryomyces hansenii, Candida albicans and C. sake. Agrochemicals tested in vitro were divided into four classes of toxicity to yeasts: (1) tebuconazole and a commercial mixture of flusilazole and carbendazim - most toxic to yeasts; (2) fenpropimorph and a commercial mixture of pyraclostrobin and epoxyconazole; (3) propiconazole, chitosan, thiophanate-methyl and a commercial mixture of o-nitrophenol, p-nitrophenol and 5-nitroguaiacol; (4) trinexapac-ethyl and azoxystrobin - least toxic to yeasts. It was found that agrochemicals can have an adverse effect on yeast abundance and the composition of yeast communities, mostly due to differences in fungicide resistance between yeast species, including the clinically significant C. albicans."

"30052107","abstracttext","The widely grown hard red winter wheat cultivar Duster released in 2006 has remained highly resistant to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina in the southern Great Plains of the United States. In contrast, many of the winter wheat cultivars in this region are susceptible to leaf rust. The goal of this study was to identify the number and chromosome location of leaf rust resistance genes in a line of Thatcher*2/Duster wheat that was selected for adult plant leaf rust resistance. The Thatcher*2/Duster line was crossed with Thatcher (Tc) and a recombinant line inbred line (RIL) population was advanced to the F 6 generation by single-seed descent. The parents and RIL population were phenotyped for leaf rust resistance in three field plot tests and in an adult plant greenhouse test. Single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers derived from the Illumina Infinium iSelect 90K wheat SNP array, kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction assays on chromosome 3BL, and a sequence tagged site (STS) marker on chromosome 1BL were used to construct a genetic map of the RIL population. The STS marker csLV46G22 that is linked with resistance gene Lr46 on chromosome 1BL, and SNP marker IWB10344 that is linked with Lr77 on chromosome 3BL, were significantly associated with lower leaf rust severity. Duster has at least three adult plant resistance genes for leaf rust resistance because it was previously determined to also have the adult plant resistance gene Lr34. Duster is a valuable source of durable leaf rust resistance for hard red winter wheat improvement in the Great Plains region."

"30240432","abstracttext","The aim of this study was to isolate, characterize and use phosphate solubilizing bacteria to enhance the bioavailability of insoluble Ca-phosphate for wheat plants. For this purpose, 15 phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB) were isolated from wheat rhizospheric soils of Peshawar and southern Punjab region, Pakistan. These isolates were identified using light microscopy and 16S rRNA gene. Among the isolated bacteria, two strains (Pseudomonas sp. MS16 and Enterobacter sp. MS32) were the efficient P solubilizers based on their P solubilization activity determined qualitatively (solubilization index 3.2-5.8) as well as quantitatively (136-280 μg mL-1). These two strains produced indole-3-acetic acid (25.6-28.1 μg mL-1), gibberellic acid (2.5-11.8), solubilized zinc compounds (SI 2.8-3.3) and showed nitrogenase and 1-Aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase activity in vitro. Phosphate solubilization activity of Pseudomonas sp. MS16 was further validated by amplification, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of glucose dehydrogenase (gcd) gene (LT908484) responsible for P solubilization. Response Surface Methodology for large-scale production was used to find optimal conditions (Temperature 22.5°C, pH 7) for P solubilization. Glucose was found to support higher P solubilization in vitro. In an in vitro experiment, PSB treated wheat seedlings improved germination and seedling vigor (11% increases) as compared to un-inoculated control. Rhizoscanning of these seedlings showed an increase in various root growth parameters. Wheat inoculation with selected strain MS16 showed pronounced effect on grain yield in pot (38.5% increase) and field (17-18% increase) experiments compared to non-inoculated control. Root colonization by PSB through Florescent in situ Hybridization and Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy confirmed their rhizosphere competence in soil. BOX-PCR confirmed the re-isolated colonies of Pseudomonas sp. MS16. The results indicated that gluconic acid producing Pseudomonas sp. MS16 from un-explored soils may be cost effective and environment friendly candidate to improve plant growth and phosphorous uptake by wheat plants."

"30804359","abstracttext","Using Wheat 90 K SNP assay, kernel-related traits of Chinese bread wheat were used to perform association mapping in 14 environments by GWAS. Results indicated that 996 and 953 of 4417 and 3172 significant SNPs for kernel length and thousand-kernel weight were located on the chromosome 7B. Haplotype analysis of these SNPs on 7B generated the block containing the predicted TaGW8-B1 gene. TaGW8-B1 gene was further cloned by sequencing in bread wheat and a 276-bp InDel was found in the first intron. TaGW8-B1 without and with the 276-bp InDel were designated as TaGW8-B1a and TaGW8-B1b, respectively. Analysis of agronomic traits indicated that cultivars with TaGW8-B1a possessed significantly wider kernel width, significantly more kernel number per spike, longer kernel length, higher thousand-kernel weight and more spikelet number per spike than cultivars with TaGW8-B1b. Furthermore, cultivars with TaGW8-B1a possessed significantly higher yield than cultivars with TaGW8-B1b. Therefore, TaGW8-B1a was considered as a potentially superior allele. Meanwhile, TaGW8-B1a possessed a significantly higher expression level than TaGW8-B1b in mature seeds by qRT-PCR. It possibly suggested that the high expression of TaGW8-B1 was positively associated with kernel size in bread wheat. Distribution of TaGW8-B1 allele indicated that TaGW8-B1a has been positively selected in Chinese wheat."

"30699782","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici causes stripe rust (yellow rust) of wheat and is highly variable in virulence toward wheat with race-specific resistance. During 2010, wheat stripe rust was the most widespread in the recorded history of the United States, resulting in large-scale application of fungicides and substantial yield loss. A new differential set with 18 yellow rust (Yr) single-gene lines was established and used to differentiate races of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici, which were named as race PSTv in distinction from the PST races identified in the past. An octal system was used to describe the virulence and avirulence patterns of the PSTv races. From 348 viable P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates recovered from a total of 381 wheat and grass stripe rust samples collected in 24 states, 41 races, named PSTv-1 to PSTv-41, were identified using the new set of 18 Yr single-gene differentials, and their equivalent PST race names were determined on the previous set of 20 wheat cultivar differentials. The frequencies and distributions of the races and their virulences were determined. The five most predominant races were PSTv-37 (34.5%), PSTv-11 (17.5%), PSTv-14 (7.2%), PSTv-36 (5.2%), and PSTv-34 (4.9%). PSTv-37 was distributed throughout the country while PSTv-11 and PSTv-14 were almost restricted to states west of the Rocky Mountains. The races had virulence to 0 to 13 of the 18 Yr genes. Frequencies of virulences toward resistance genes Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr17, Yr27, Yr43, Yr44, YrTr1, and YrExp2 were high (67.0 to 93.7%); those to Yr1 (32.8%) and YrTye (31.3%) were moderate; and those to Yr10, Yr24, Yr32, and YrSP were low (3.4 to 5.7%). All of the isolates were avirulent to Yr5 and Yr15."

"31963482","abstracttext","Heat shock transcription factors (HSFs) play crucial roles in resisting heat stress and regulating plant development. Recently, HSFs have been shown to play roles in anther development. Thus, investigating the HSF family members and identifying their protective roles in anthers are essential for the further development of male sterile wheat breeding. In the present study, 61 wheat HSF genes ( TaHsfs ) were identified in the whole wheat genome and they are unequally distributed on 21 chromosomes. According to gene structure and phylogenetic analyses, the 61 TaHsf s were classified into three categories and 12 subclasses. Genome-wide duplication was identified as the main source of the expansion of the wheat HSF gene family based on 14 pairs of homeologous triplets, whereas only a very small number of TaHsfs were derived by segmental duplication and tandem duplication. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), HSP70, and another class of chaperone protein called htpG were identified as proteins that interact with wheat HSFs. RNA-seq analysis indicated that TaHsfs have obvious period- and tissue-specific expression patterns, and the TaHsfs in classes A and B respond to heat shock, whereas the C class TaHsfs are involved in drought regulation. qRT-PCR identified three TaHsfA2bs with differential expression in sterile and fertile anthers, and they may be candidate genes involved in anther development. This comprehensive analysis provides novel insights into TaHsfs , and it will be useful for understanding the mechanism of plant fertility conversion."

"31932954","abstracttext_key message","A spontaneous Robertsonian T4S l S·4BL translocation chromosome carrying Pm66 for powdery mildew resistance was discovered and confirmed by RNA-seq, molecular marker, and in situ hybridization analyses. Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is a severe disease of bread wheat worldwide. Discovery and utilization of resistance genes to powdery mildew from wild relatives of wheat have played important roles in wheat improvement. Aegilops longissima, one of the S-genome diploid wild relatives of wheat, is a valuable source of disease and pest resistance for wheat. Chromosome 4S l from Ae. longissima confers moderate resistance to powdery mildew. In this study, we conducted RNA-seq on a putative Chinese Spring (CS)-Ae. longissima 4S l (4B) disomic substitution line (TA3465) to develop 4S l -specific markers to assist the transfer of a Bgt resistance gene from 4S l by induced homoeologous recombination. A pairwise comparison of genes between CS and TA3465 demonstrated that a number of genes on chromosome 4BS in CS were not expressed in TA3465. Analysis of 4B- and 4S l -specific molecular markers showed that 4BS and 4S l L were both missing in TA3465, whereas 4BL and 4S l S were present. Further characterization by genomic and fluorescent in situ hybridization confirmed that TA3465 carried a spontaneous Robertsonian T4S l S·4BL translocation. Powdery mildew tests showed that TA3465 was resistant to 10 of 16 Bgt isolates collected from different regions of China, whereas CS was susceptible to all those Bgt isolates. The powdery mildew resistance gene(s) in TA3465 was further mapped to the short arm of 4S l and designated as Pm66."

Wheat cultivation based on limited number of rust resistance genes deployed over vast areas expedites the emergence of new pathotypes warranting a continuous deployment of new resistance genes. In this paper, fine mapping of Aegilops umbellulata-derived leaf rust and stripe rust resistance genes Lr76 and Yr70 is being reported. We flow sorted and paired-end sequenced 5U chromosome of Ae. umbellulata, recombinant chromosome 5D (5D IL ) from wheat-Ae. umbellulata introgression line pau16057 and 5D RP of recurrent parent WL711. Chromosome 5U reads were mapped against the reference Chinese Spring chromosome 5D sequence, and alien-specific SNPs were identified. Chromosome 5D IL and 5D RP sequences were de novo assembled, and alien introgression-specific markers were designed by selecting 5U- and 5D-specific SNPs. Overall, 27 KASP markers were mapped in high-resolution population consisting of 1404 F 5 RILs. The mapping population segregated for single gene each for leaf rust and stripe rust resistance. The physical order of the SNPs in pau16057 was defined by projecting the 27 SNPs against the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 sequence. Based on this physical map, the size of Ae. umbellulata introgression was determined to be 9.47 Mb on the distal most end of the short arm of chromosome 5D. This non-recombining alien segment carries six NB-LRR encoding genes based on NLR annotation of assembled chromosome 5D IL sequence and IWGSC RefSeq v1.1 gene models. The presence of SNPs and other sequence variations in these genes between pau16057 and WL711 suggested that they are candidates for Lr76 and Yr70."
"32066846","articletitle","Identification and validation of reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization in wheat meiosis."
"32066846","abstracttext","Meiosis is a specialized type of cell division occurring in sexually reproducing organisms to generate haploid cells known as gametes. In flowering plants, male gametes are produced in anthers, being encased in pollen grains. Understanding the genetic regulation of meiosis key events such as chromosome recognition and pairing, synapsis and recombination, is needed to manipulate chromosome associations for breeding purposes, particularly in important cereal crops like wheat. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is widely used to analyse gene expression and to validate the results obtained by other transcriptomic analyses, like RNA-seq. Selection and validation of appropriate reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization is essential to obtain reproducible and accurate expression data. In this work, twelve candidate reference genes were evaluated using the mainstream algorithms geNorm, Normfinder, BestKeeper and ΔCt, then ranked from most to least suitable for normalization with RefFinder. Different sets of reference genes were recommended to normalize gene expression data in anther meiosis of bread and durum wheat, their corresponding genotypes in the absence of the Ph1 locus and for comparative studies among wheat genotypes. Comparisons between meiotic (anthers) and somatic (leaves and roots) wheat tissues were also carried out. To the best of our knowledge, our study provides the first comprehensive list of reference genes for robust RT-qPCR normalization to study differentially expressed genes during male meiosis in wheat in a breeding framework."

"31333714","abstracttext","Cross-kingdom small RNA (sRNA) silencing has recently emerged as a mechanism facilitating fungal colonization and disease development. Here we characterized RNAi pathways in Zymoseptoria tritici , a major fungal pathogen of wheat, and assessed their contribution to pathogenesis. Computational analysis of fungal sRNA and host mRNA sequencing datasets was used to define the global sRNA populations in Z. tritici and predict their mRNA targets in wheat. 389 in planta -induced sRNA loci were identified. sRNAs generated from some of these loci were predicted to target wheat mRNAs including those potentially involved in pathogen defense. However, molecular approaches failed to validate targeting of selected wheat mRNAs by fungal sRNAs. Mutant strains of Z. tritici carrying deletions of genes encoding key components of RNAi such as Dicer-like (DCL) and Argonaute (AGO) proteins were generated, and virulence bioassays suggested that these are dispensable for full infection of wheat. Nonetheless, our results did suggest the existence of non-canonical DCL-independent pathway(s) for sRNA biogenesis in Z. tritici . dsRNA targeting essential fungal genes applied in vitro or generated from an RNA virus vector in planta in a procedure known as HIGS (Host-Induced Gene Silencing) was ineffective in preventing Z. tritici growth or disease. We also demonstrated that Z. tritici is incapable of dsRNA uptake. Collectively, our data suggest that RNAi approaches for gene function analyses in this fungal species and potentially also as a control measure may not be as effective as has been demonstrated for some other plant pathogenic fungi."

We found that most of the genes coding for subunit proteins are present as paralogs in bread wheat.

"31798603","articletitle","Effects of High Temperature and Drought Stress on the Expression of Gene Encoding Enzymes and the Activity of Key Enzymes Involved in Starch Biosynthesis in Wheat Grains."
"31798603","abstracttext","High temperature (HT) and drought stress (DS) play negative roles in wheat growth, and are two most important factors that limit grain yield. Starch, the main component of the wheat [][endosperm, accounts for 65-75% of grain weight, and is significantly influenced by environmental factors. To understand the effects of post-anthesis HT and DS on starch biosynthesis, we performed a pot experiment using wheat cultivar ""Zhengmai 366"" under field conditions combined with a climate-controlled greenhouse to simulate HT. There were two temperature regimes (optimum day/night temperatures of 25/15°C and high day/night temperatures of 32/22°C from 10 days after anthesis to maturity) accompanied by two water treatments (optimum of ∼75% relative soil water content, and a DS of ∼50% relative soil water content). Optimum temperature with optimum water treatment was the control (CK). We evaluated the expression patterns of 23 genes encoding six classes of enzymes involved in starch biosynthesis in wheat grains using real-time qPCR. HT, DS, and HT+DS treatments altered gene expression profiles. Compared to the CK, expression of 22 of the 23 genes was down regulated by HT, and only one gene ( ISA2 ) was up-regulated by HT. Actually ISA2 was the only gene up-regulated by all three stress treatments. The expression of 17 genes was up-regulated, while six genes, including granule-bound starch synthase ( GBSSI ) , AGPS2 , BEIII, PHOL, ISA1 , and AGPL2 , were down-regulated by DS. Eleven genes were down-regulated and 12 were up-regulated by HT+DS. The activity of ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase, starch synthases , GBSS, SS, and starch branching enzymes in the stress treatments (HT, DS, and HT+DS) often appeared to peak values in advance and declined significantly to be lower than that in the CK. The genes that coordinated participation in the enzymes formation can serve as an indicator of the enzymes activity potentially involved in starch biosynthesis. HT, DS, and HT+DS altered the timing of starch biosynthesis and also influenced the accumulation of amylose, amylopectin, total starch, and sucrose. Under HT, DS, and HT+DS, the key enzymes activity and their genes expression associated with the conversion of sucrose to starch, was reduced, which was the leading cause of the reductions in starch content. Our study provide further evidence about the effects of stress on starch biosynthesis in wheat, as well as a physiological understanding of the impact of post-anthesis heat and DS on starch accumulation and wheat grain yield."
"23841622","articletitle","Allele characterization of genes required for rpg4-mediated wheat stem rust resistance identifies Rpg5 as the R gene."
"23841622","abstracttext","A highly virulent form of the wheat stem rust pathogen Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK is virulent on both wheat and barley, presenting a major threat to world food security. The recessive and temperature-sensitive rpg4 gene is the only effective source of resistance identified in barley (Hordeum vulgare) against P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK. Efforts to position clone rpg4 localized resistance to a small interval on barley chromosome 5HL, tightly linked to the rye stem rust (P. graminis f. sp. secalis) resistance (R) gene Rpg5. High-resolution genetic analysis and post-transcriptional gene silencing of the genes at the rpg4/Rpg5 locus determined that three tightly linked genes (Rpg5, HvRga1, and HvAdf3) are required together for rpg4-mediated wheat stem rust resistance. Alleles of the three genes were analyzed from a diverse set of 14 domesticated barley lines (H. vulgare) and 8 wild barley accessions (H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum) to characterize diversity that may determine incompatibility (resistance). The analysis determined that HvAdf3 and HvRga1 code for predicted functional proteins that do not appear to contain polymorphisms determining the compatible (susceptible) interactions with the wheat stem rust pathogen and were expressed at the transcriptional level from both resistant and susceptible barley lines. The HvAdf3 alleles shared 100% amino acid identity among all 22 genotypes examined. The P. graminis f. sp. tritici race QCCJ-susceptible barley lines with HvRga1 alleles containing the limited amino acid substitutions unique to the susceptible varieties also contained predicted nonfunctional rpg5 alleles. Thus, susceptibility in these lines is likely due to the nonfunctional RPG5 proteins. The Rpg5 allele analysis determined that 9 of the 13 P. graminis f. sp. tritici race QCCJ-susceptible barley lines contain alleles that either code for predicted truncated proteins as the result of a single nucleotide substitution, resulting in a stop codon at amino acid 161, a single cytosine indel causing a frame shift, and a stop codon at amino acid 217, or an indel that deleted the entire STPK domain. The three P. graminis f. sp. tritici race QCCJ-susceptible lines (Swiss landraces Hv489, Hv492, and Hv611) and the wild barley accession WBDC160 contain rpg5 alleles predicted to encode full-length proteins containing a nonsynonomous nucleotide substitution that results in the amino acid substitution E1287A. This amino acid substitution present in the uncharacterized C-terminal domain is not found in any resistant line and may be important to elicit the resistance reaction. These data suggest that rpg4-mediated resistance against many wheat stem rust pathogen races, including P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK, rely on the Rpg5 R gene; thus, rpg4- and Rpg5-mediated resistance rely on a common R gene and should not be considered completely distinct. The data also determined that Rpg5 gene-specific molecular markers could be used to detect rpg4-mediated wheat stem rust resistance for marker-assisted selection."

"2516240","abstracttext","A cDNA encoding trypsin inhibitor CMe from barley endosperm has been cloned and characterized. The longest open reading frame of the cloned cDNA codes for a typical signal peptide of 24 residues followed by a sequence which is identical to the known amino acid sequence of the inhibitor, except for an Ile/Leu substitution at position 59. Southern blot analysis of wheat-barley addition lines has shown that chromosome 3H of barley carries the gene for CMe. This protein is present at less than 2%-3% of the wild-type amount in the mature endosperm of the mutant Risø 1508 with respect to Bomi barley, from which it has been derived, and the corresponding steady state levels of the CMe mRNA are about 1%. One or two copies of the CMe gene (synonym Itc1) per haploid genome have been estimated both in the wild type and in the mutant, and DNA restriction patterns are identical in both stocks, so neither a change in copy number nor a major rearrangement of the structural gene account for the markedly decreased expression. The mutation at the lys 3a locus in Risø 1508 has been previously mapped in chromosome 7 (synonym 5H). A single dose of the wild-type allele at this locus (Lys 3a) restores the expression of gene CMe (allele CMe-1) in chromosome 3H to normal levels."
"2293668","articletitle","Nonstructural protein of parvoviruses B19 and minute virus of mice controls transcription."
"2293668","abstracttext","The genome of the human parvovirus B19 contains a transcriptional promoter (BP06) at map position 6, upstream from the nonstructural protein genes. By cotransfecting HeLa cells with this promoter cloned before the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene together with a plasmid containing almost the whole B19 genome, we showed that BP06 is transactivated by a B19 gene product. The transactivating viral protein was identified as the nonstructural protein NS-1. NS-1 synthesized in a wheat germ extract specifically stimulates transcription from BP06 in vitro. NS-1 of the minute virus of mice (MVM) activates the analogous MVM promoter, MP04. NS-1, therefore, has a positive feedback effect on the activity of its own promoter. Moreover, NS-1 of MVM activates the human BP06. We have identified, in the genome of B19, a second transcriptional promoter activity at map position 44, before the capsid protein genes. This promoter, BP44, was identified by cloning fragments of B19 DNA upstream of the CAT gene, transfecting the DNA into HeLa cells, and measuring CAT expression. The strength of the BP44 promoter is similar to that of the capsid gene promoter, MP39, of MVM. In (nonpermissive) HeLa cells, the BP44 promoter is not activated by NS-1. Thus, the BP06 promoter apparently does not determine the tissue specificity of B19 virus but BP44 could do so."

"1524833","abstracttext","Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) have been applied to regulate gene expression using cell-free media or animal cells. Here we demonstrate the specific inhibition of barley alpha-amylase gene expression by synthetic antisense ODNs. In a cell free system using wheat-germ extracts, 5 microM of a 20-mer antisense ODN prevented the synthesis of the polypeptide corresponding to the predetermined length of alpha-amylase translated in vitro, whereas there was no effect on other protein synthesis. Furthermore, in cultured aleurone cells, alpha-amylase activity was efficiently decreased by addition of ODNs. At the concentrations higher than 5 microM, antisense ODN inhibited alpha-amylase gene expression almost completely. These results imply that ODN could transport into the cultured aleurone cells crossing the cell membrane, and regulate specific gene expression. This simple model system could be applicable not only for the analysis of the alpha-amylase multigene family in barley but also for studying functions of cryptic genes in higher plant."

"2411949","abstracttext","Interferons alpha and beta induce an efficient antiviral state against influenza virus in mouse cells that possess the Mx gene, but not in mouse cells that lack this gene. In Mx-containing cells treated with interferon the amount of viral mRNA synthesized as a result of primary transcription is drastically reduced. Only two viral mRNAs could be detected by Northern analysis and by translating the poly(A)+ RNA from infected cells in wheat germ extracts: a reduced amount of the mRNA for nonstructural protein 1 and an even lower amount of the mRNA for the matrix protein. The other viral mRNAs were not made in detectable amounts. In addition, the rate of viral mRNA synthesis catalyzed by the inoculum transcriptase, measured by in vitro RNA synthesis catalyzed by permeabilized cells, was severely inhibited. In contrast, interferon treatment of cells lacking the Mx gene had little or no effect on either the steady-state level or the rate of synthesis of viral mRNAs made by the inoculum transcriptase. These results indicate that the interferon-induced Mx gene product, a 75,000-molecular-weight protein that accumulates in the nucleus, inhibits influenza viral mRNA synthesis which occurs in the nucleus. No Mx-specific effect acting directly on viral protein synthesis in the cytoplasm was observed."

"3776102","abstracttext","A cDNA clone encoding the nonstructural, 30-kDa protein of the common (U1) strain of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) was isolated and characterized. cDNA clones representing the intact gene as well as deletions from the 5' end of the gene were subcloned into SP6 vectors. Capped RNAs produced by in vitro transcription reactions were translated in a wheat germ cell-free system. The resultant proteins were compared to proteins obtained from the in vitro translation of intermediate length (I2) rods of TMV. Transcripts of the cDNA clones encoded polypeptides of 30, 28, or 18 kDa that were immunoprecipitated by antibody prepared against a synthetic peptide representing the carboxy terminus of the 30-kDa protein. cDNA clones containing the intact 30-kDa sequence coded for 30-kDa polypeptides while clones lacking the 30-kDa initiation codon produced 28-kDa polypeptides. Surprisingly, translation of a transcript from a cDNA clone containing the 30-kDa gene plus 390 nucleotides 5' of the initiator AUG yielded a polypeptide with an approximate molecular mass of 18 kDa. The results indicate that an intact and functional 30-kDa protein gene has been cloned. The significance of these results, with respect to determining the function of the 30-kDa protein, is discussed."

"1724755","abstracttext","A yeast membrane protein was isolated by its binding to tRNA Sepharose column. The 45 kDa protein shares characteristics with rat liver nuclear pore proteins in having reactivity with a monoclonal antibody (RL1) raised against rat liver nuclear pore proteins and by the binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), indicating the presence of N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) moieties. Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation experiments indicate that the protein is located in the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum of the cell. The gene for the 45 kDa protein was cloned using degenerate oligonucleotides derived from the N-terminal protein sequence and confirmed by internal peptide sequences. The gene was named WBP1. The protein coding sequence of the WBP1 gene reveals an ER entry signal peptide and a C-terminal membrane spanning domain. Topological studies indicate that the C-terminus of the protein is located in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic tail of the protein contains the K-K-X-X signal known to be sufficient for retention of transmembrane proteins in higher eukaryotic cells. Gene disruption experiments show that the 45 kDa protein is essential for the vegetative life cycle of the yeast cell."
"7635297","articletitle","Intraspecific and interspecific variation in 5S RNA genes are decoupled in diploid wheat relatives."
"7635297","abstracttext","5S RNAs form part of the ribosome in most organisms. In some, e.g., prokaryotes and some fungi, the genes are part of the ribosomal operon, but in most eukaryotes they are in tandem arrays of hundreds to thousands of copies separate from the main ribosomal array. 5S RNA genes can be aligned across kingdoms. We were therefore surprised to find that, for 28 diploid species of the wheat tribe (Triticeae), nucleotide diversity within an array is up to 6.2% in the genes, not significantly different from that of the nontranscribed spacers. Rates of concerted evolution must therefore be insufficient to homogenize the entire array. Between species, there are significantly fewer fixed differences in the gene than would be expected, given the high within-species variation. In contrast, the amount of variation between species in the spacer is the same as or greater than that within individuals. This leads to a paradox. High variation within an individual suggests that there is little selection on any particular gene within an array. But conservation of the gene across species implies that polymorphisms are periodically eliminated at a rate approximately equal to or greater than that of speciation. Levels of intraspecific polymorphism and interspecific divergence are thus decoupled. This implies that selective mechanisms exist to eliminate mutations in the gene without also affecting the spacer."
"8204823","articletitle","A cereal haemoglobin gene is expressed in seed and root tissues under anaerobic conditions."
"8204823","abstracttext","Legumes, and a very few non-legume plant species, are known to possess functioning haemoglobin genes. We describe here the characterization of a haemoglobin cDNA isolated from barley. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 71% amino acid identity with a non-legume haemoglobin gene, a further 16% of the residues being conservative replacements. The barley cDNA also hybridizes to genomic sequences in rye, maize and wheat. The demonstration of a gene from a monocotyledon with close sequence homology to the known non-legume plant haemoglobins fills a major gap in the known distribution of haemoglobin genes in the plant kingdom. The expression of the gene is induced in isolated barley aleurone layers exposed to anaerobic conditions, and the roots of flooding-stressed barley plants. The expression of the RNA under anoxic conditions is similar to that of a known anaerobic response gene, alcohol dehydrogenase. Our results suggest that the increased expression of haemoglobin RNA is an integral part of the normal anaerobic response in barley. The findings are discussed in the light of current theories of haemoglobin function and evolution."

"8846769","abstracttext","In animals, plants and fungi, cholera toxin (CTX) can activate signalling pathways dependent on heterotrimeric GTP binding proteins (G-proteins). We transformed tobacco plants with a chimeric gene encoding the A1 subunit of CTX regulated by a light-inducible wheat Cab-1 promoter. Tissues of transgenic plants expressing CTX showed greatly reduced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas tabaci, accumulated high levels of salicylic acid (SA) and constitutively expressed pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes encoding PR-1 and the class II isoforms of PR-2 and PR-3. In contrast, the class I isoforms of PR-2 and PR-3 known to be induced in tobacco by stress, by ethylene treatment and as part of the hypersensitive response to infection, were not induced and displayed normal regulation. In good agreement with these results, microinjection experiments demonstrated that CTX or GTP-gamma-S induced the expression of a PR1-GUS reporter gene but not that of a GLB-GUS reporter gene containing the promoter region of a gene encoding the class I isoform of PR-2. Microinjection and grafting experiments strongly suggest that CTX-sensitive G-proteins are important in inducing the expression of a subset of PR genes and that these G-proteins act locally rather than systemically upstream of SA induction."

"11135122","abstracttext","Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been shown to specifically interfere with gene function in several organisms including tobacco and the model plant Arabidopsis. Here, we report on rapid and sequence-specific interference of dsRNA with gene function in cereals. Delivery of cognate dsRNA into single epidermal cells of maize, barley or wheat by particle bombardment interfered with the function of co-bombarded UidA (GUS) and TaGLP2a:GFP reporter genes. Cognate dsRNA was also found to specifically interfere with the function of the endogenous genes A1 and Ant18 encoding dihydroflavonol-4-reductase in maize and barley, respectively. Dihydroflavonol-4-reductase is an essential enzyme of the anthocyanin biosynthetic pathway in maize and barley. This pathway can be induced by transient expression of the C1- and b-Peru genes that encode transcription factors. In the presence of dsRNA corresponding to the dihydroflavonol-4-reductase gene, C1- and b-Peru-dependent, cell-autonomous accumulation of red anthocyanin pigments in bombarded cells of maize and barley was reduced. dsRNA was also demonstrated to negatively interfere with Mlo, which encodes a negative regulator of race non-specific resistance to the powdery mildew fungus in barley. In the presence of Mlo dsRNA, transformed cells became more resistant, thereby phenocopying plants that carry a heritable loss-of function mlo resistance allele. The results suggest that direct delivery of dsRNA to cereals leads to a rapid and sequence-specific interference with gene function at the single-cell level."

The Coix gene cluster was cloned and sequenced, and its expression analyzed. The gene sequence and gene locus organization were found to be similar to the corresponding cluster in wheat and maize. Northern hybridization and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analyses indicated that nad3 and rps12 genes were co-transcribed as a 1.25 kb RNA molecule. The transcript displayed 20 and six RNA edition sites, in the nad3 and rps12 genes, respectively, that changed the codon identities to amino acids, which are better conserved in different organisms. Twenty-three cDNA clones were analysed for the edition process and revealed different partial editing patterns without apparent sequential processing."

"10659769","abstracttext","Microsatellite and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) primers were used to identify molecular markers linked to the Yr15 gene which confer resistance to stripe rust (Puccina striiformis Westend) in wheat. By using near isogenic lines (NILs) for the Yr15 gene and a F2 mapping population derived from crosses of these lines and phenotyped for resistance, we identified one microsatellite marker (GWM33) and one RAPD marker (OPA19(800)) linked to Yr15. Then, bulked segregant analysis was used in addition to the NILs to identify RAPD markers linked to the target gene. Using this approach, two RAPD markers linked to Yr15 were identified, one in coupling (UBC199(700)) and one in repulsion phase (UBC212(1200)). After MAPMAKER linkage analysis on the F2 population, the two closest markers were shown to be linked to Yr15 within a distance of about 12 cM. The recombination rates were recalculated using the maximum likelihood technique to take into account putative escaped individuals from the stripe rust resistance test and obtain unbiased distance estimates. As a result of this study, the stripe rust resistance gene Yr15 is surrounded by two flanking PCR markers, UBC199(700) and GWM33, at about 5 cM from each side."

Q confers the free-threshing character of the spike and influences other important agronomic traits. Using chromosome deletion lines, Q was placed on the physical map within a submicroscopic segment of the long arm of chromosome 5A. We targeted markers to the segment by comparative mapping of anonymous RFLP clones, AFLP, and mRNA differential display analysis of deletion lines 5AL-7 and -23, which have deletion breakpoints that flank the Q locus. Differentially expressed sequences detected fragments at various loci on group 5 chromosomes suggesting that Q may be a regulatory gene. We identified 18 markers within the Q gene deletion interval and used them to construct a genetic linkage map of the region in F2 populations derived from chromosome 5A disomic substitution lines. The genetic map corresponding to the deletion segment was 20-cM long, and we identified markers as close as 0.7 cM to the Q gene. An estimate of base pairs per centimorgan within the region is 250 kb/cM, an 18-fold increase in recombination compared with the genomic average. Genomic targeting and high-density mapping provide a basis for the map-based cloning of the Q gene."

"12096095","abstracttext","The level of grain dormancy and sensitivity to ABA of the embryo, a key factor in grain dormancy, were examined in developing grains of a white-grained wheat line, Novosibirskaya 67 (NS-67), and its red-grained near-isogenic lines (ANK-1A to -1D); a red-grained line, AUS 1490, and its white-grained mutant line (EMS-AUS). ANK lines showed higher levels of grain dormancy than NS-67 at harvest maturity. AUS 1490 grain also showed higher dormancy than EMS-AUS grain. These results suggest that the R gene for grain colour can enhance grain dormancy. However, the dormancy effect conferred by the R gene was not large, suggesting that it plays a minor role in the development of grain dormancy. Water extracts of AUS 1490 and EMS-AUS bran contained germination inhibitors equivalent to 1-10 microM ABA, although there was no difference in the amount of inhibitors between AUS 1490 and EMS-AUS. Thus, the grain colour gene of AUS 1490 did not appear to enhance the level of grain dormancy by accumulating germination inhibitors in its bran. Sensitivity to ABA of embryos was higher in grains collected around harvest-maturity for ANK lines and AUS 1490, compared with NS-67 and EMS-AUS. The R gene might enhance grain dormancy by increasing the sensitivity of embryos to ABA."

Direct N-terminal amino acid sequencing showed that the precursor of XynF3 had a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. The predicted amino acid sequence of XynF3 has strong similarity to other family 10 xylanases from fungi. The xynF3 gene was successfully overexpressed in A. oryzae and the XynF3 was purified. The molecular mass of XynF3 estimated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 32,000. This was almost the same as the molecular mass of 32,437 calculated from the deduced amino acid sequence. The purified XynF3 showed an optimum activity at pH 5.0 and 58 degrees C. It had a Km of 6.5 mg/ml and a Vmax of 435 micromol x min(-1) x mg(-1) when birch wood xylan was used as a substrate. Expression of the xynF3 gene was analyzed using an Escherichia coli beta-glucuronidase gene as a reporter.

Comparisons of orthologous maize-rice and maize-sorghum gene pairs identified 20 bp as a minimal length criterion for a significant CNS among grass genes, with few such CNS found to be conserved across rice, maize, sorghum, and barley. The frequency and length of cereal CNS as well as nucleotide substitution rates within CNS were consistent with the known phylogenetic distances among the species compared. The implications of these findings for the evolution of cereal gene promoter sequences and the utility of using the nearly completed rice genome sequence to predict candidate regulatory elements in other cereal genes by phylogenetic footprinting are discussed."

"12663666","abstracttext","The use of internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) is one of the unorthodox mechanisms exploited by viruses to initiate the translation of internal genes. Herein, we report a plant virus exploiting an IRES and its 3'-untranslated region (UTR) to express its internal genes, notably the 3'-proximal viral coat protein gene. Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot virus (HCRSV), a positive-strand non-polyadenylated RNA virus, was demonstrated to harbor a unique 100-nucleotide (nt) IRES, located 124 nt upstream of the coat protein gene, that could function in wheat germ extract, rabbit reticulocyte lysate, and mammalian cells. In comparison with other known IRESs of picornaviruses and eukaryotic mRNAs, this 100-nt IRES is distinctively short and simple. The IRES activity was tested in homologous and heterologous bicistronic constructs, and the expression of the 3'-proximal gene was enhanced when the 3'-UTR was present. When the IRES element was bisected, each half still possessed IRES activity and could initiate internal translation on its own. Site-directed mutagenesis and deletion analyses revealed that the primary sequence within the 5' half was crucial for IRES activity, whereas the primary sequence of the second half and a GNRA motif were non-essential. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a mechanism whereby an IRES, located in the 3' portion of the virus genome, co-operates with the 3'-UTR to enhance gene expression differentially."

"15824885","abstracttext","The appearance of de novo deletion mutations in the readthrough (RT) region (nucleotide positions 861-2591) downstream of the capsid protein (CP) gene of a Japanese strain of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus RNA2 was examined using infectious transcripts. Mutant RNA2s with different deletions predominated in independent serial passage experiments but all best-adapted mutants retained the 3'-terminal portion of the RT gene in frame with the CP gene. The longest best-adapted mutation deleted the 1434 nucleotides between positions 1061 and 2494. When the RT protein was truncated by insertion of a termination codon plus an additional nucleotide to give a +1 frame-shift, after serial passages the progeny viruses regained the ability to express the C-terminal region of RT by an internal deletion. The 5' terminus of the p19 subgenomic RNA was identified at position 2598 and an essential transcription signal for this mRNA mapped between positions 2534 and 2563. A mutant in which this essential promoter element has been deleted cannot transcribe the p19 subgenomic RNA and has lost infectivity in planta. These results indicate that the 3'-terminal region of the RT gene has a major function in cis for expression of p19, which is essential for infecting plants. A reason for retaining the RT C-terminal region in stable deletion mutants is still unknown."

"14727029","abstracttext","Dwarf genes have been valuable for improving harvestable yield of several crop plants and may be useful in oilseed Brassica. We evaluated a dwarf gene, dwf2, from Brassica rapa in order to determine its phenotypic effects and genetic characteristics. The dwf2 mutant was insensitive to exogenous GA(3) for both plant height and flowering time, suggesting that it is not a mutation in the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway. The dwarf phenotype was controlled by a semidominant allele at a single locus. Near-isogenic lines that were homozygous or heterozygous for dwf2 had 47.4% or 30.0% reduction in plant height, respectively, compared to the tall wild-type line, and the reduction was due to reduced internode length and number of nodes. The dwf2 homozygous and heterozygous lines had the same or significantly higher numbers of primary branches than the wild-type line, but did not differ in flowering time. The DWF2 gene was mapped to the bottom of linkage group R6, in a region having homology to the top of Arabidopsis thaliana chromosome 2. The map position of DWF2 in comparison to markers in A. thaliana suggests it is a homolog of RGA ( repressor of ga1-3), which is a homolog of the wheat ""Green Revolution"" gene. This dwarf gene could be used to gain more insight on the gibberellin pathway and to reduce lodging problems in hybrid oilseed Brassica cultivars."
"18384660","articletitle","Host-specific toxins: effectors of necrotrophic pathogenicity."
"18384660","abstracttext","Host-specific toxins (HSTs) are defined as pathogen effectors that induce toxicity and promote disease only in the host species and only in genotypes of that host expressing a specific and often dominant susceptibility gene. They are a feature of a small but well-studied group of fungal plant pathogens. Classical HST pathogens include species of Cochliobolus, Alternaria and Pyrenophora. Recent studies have shown that Stagonospora nodorum produces at least four separate HSTs that interact with four of the many quantitative resistance loci found in the host, wheat. Rationalization of fungal phylogenetics has placed these pathogens in the Pleosporales order of the class Dothideomycetes. It is possible that all HST pathogens lie in this order. Strong evidence of the recent lateral gene transfer of the ToxA gene from S. nodorum to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis has been obtained. Hallmarks of lateral gene transfer are present for all the studied HST genes although definitive proof is lacking. We therefore suggest that the Pleosporales pathogens may have a conserved propensity to acquire HST genes by lateral transfer."
"15148404","articletitle","A gene cluster for secondary metabolism in oat: implications for the evolution of metabolic diversity in plants."
"15148404","abstracttext","The evolution of the ability to synthesize specialized metabolites is likely to have been key for survival and diversification of different plant species. Oats (Avena spp.) produce antimicrobial triterpenoids (avenacins) that protect against disease. The oat beta-amyrin synthase gene AsbAS1, which encodes the first committed enzyme in the avenacin biosynthetic pathway, is clearly distinct from other plant beta-amyrin synthases. Here we show that AsbAS1 has arisen by duplication and divergence of a cycloartenol synthase-like gene, and that its properties have been refined since the divergence of oats and wheat. Strikingly, we have also found that AsbAS1 is clustered with other genes required for distinct steps in avenacin biosynthesis in a region of the genome that is not conserved in other cereals. Because the components of this gene cluster are required for at least four clearly distinct enzymatic processes (2,3-oxidosqualene cyclization, beta-amyrin oxidation, glycosylation, and acylation), it is unlikely that the cluster has arisen as a consequence of duplication of a common ancestor. Although clusters of paralogous genes are common in plants (e.g., gene clusters for rRNA and specific disease resistance), reports of clusters of genes that do not share sequence relatedness and whose products contribute to a single selectable function are rare [Gierl, A. & Frey, M. (2001) Planta 213, 493-498]. Taken together, our evidence has important implications for the generation of metabolic diversity in plants."

"15141950","abstracttext","ToxB, a gene that encodes a 6.6-kDa host-selective toxin (HST), is present in several races of the wheat pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. To learn more about the multiple ToxB open reading frames (ORFs), six of the estimated nine copies from a race 5 isolate were cloned and analyzed. All six copies of ToxB have identical 261-bp ORFs and thus encode the same form of Ptr ToxB. Sequence analysis of regions flanking the cloned ToxB loci revealed that the majority of loci are associated with portions of retrotransposons and a transposon-like sequence. Data indicate that ToxB loci reside on two chromosomes, 3.5 and 2.7 Mb, with the majority of copies located on the 2.7 Mb chromosome. A related gene, referred to as toxb, from a nonpathogenic race 4 isolate was also cloned and characterized. This is interesting because, until now, HST genes have only been found in toxin-producing, pathogenic isolates of plant pathogenic fungi. The toxb gene from nonpathogenic isolates is 86% similar to ToxB, and data suggest that toxb is a single-copy gene. No toxb transcript was detected under culture conditions that favor the expression of ToxB; therefore, these genes differ in their transcriptional regulation."

"15066795","abstracttext","Gibberella zeae (asexual state Fusarium graminearum) is a major causal agent of wheat head blight and maize ear rot in North America and is responsible for contamination of grain with deoxynivalenol and related trichothecene mycotoxins. To identify additional trichothecene biosynthetic genes, cDNA libraries were prepared from fungal cultures under trichothecene-inducing conditions in culture and in planta. A gene designated LH1 that was highly expressed under these conditions exhibited only moderate (59%) similarity to known trichothecene biosynthetic cytochrome P450s. To determine the function of LH1, gene disruptants were produced and assessed for trichothecene production. Gene disruptants no longer produced 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol, which is oxygenated at carbon 7 (C-7) and C-8, but rather accumulated calonectrin and 3-deacetylcalonectrin, which are not oxygenated at either C-7 or C-8. These results indicate that gene LH1 encodes a cytochrome P450 responsible for oxygenation at one or both of these positions. Despite the relatively low level of DNA and amino acid sequence similarity between the two genes, LH1 from G. zeae is the probable homologue of Tri1, which encodes a cytochrome P450 required for C-8 oxygenation in F. sporotrichioides."
"16172507","articletitle","Molecular characterization of the major wheat domestication gene Q."
"16172507","abstracttext","The Q gene is largely responsible for the widespread cultivation of wheat because it confers the free-threshing character. It also pleiotropically influences many other domestication-related traits such as glume shape and tenacity, rachis fragility, spike length, plant height, and spike emergence time. We isolated the Q gene and verified its identity by analysis of knockout mutants and transformation. The Q gene has a high degree of similarity to members of the AP2 family of transcription factors. The Q allele is more abundantly transcribed than q, and the two alleles differ for a single amino acid. An isoleucine at position 329 in the Q protein leads to an abundance of homodimer formation in yeast cells, whereas a valine in the q protein appears to limit homodimer formation. Ectopic expression analysis allowed us to observe both silencing and overexpression effects of Q. Rachis fragility, glume shape, and glume tenacity mimicked the q phenotype in transgenic plants exhibiting post-transcriptional silencing of the transgene and the endogenous Q gene. Variation in spike compactness and plant height were associated with the level of transgene transcription due to the dosage effects of Q. The q allele is the more primitive, and the mutation that gave rise to Q occurred only once leading to the world's cultivated wheats."
"16402192","articletitle","Structural variation and evolution of a defense-gene cluster in natural populations of Aegilops tauschii."
"16402192","abstracttext","Genetic mapping and sequencing of plant genomes have been useful for investigating eukaryotic chromosome structural organization. In many cases, analyses have been limited in the number of representatives sampled from specific groups. The degree of intraspecific genome diversity remains in question. The possibility exists that a single model genome may have limited utility for identifying genes in related members of the species or genus. Crop improvement programs have particular interests in disease resistance genes that are harbored by wild relatives of modern cultivated crops. These genes are evolutionarily dynamic and under selective pressure by a broad range of pathogenic organisms. Using resistance gene analogs as models for gene evolution, intraspecific genome comparisons were made among populations of wild diploid wheat (Aegilops tauschii). We observed that deletion haplotypes are occurring frequently and independently in the genome. Haplotypes are geographically correlated and maintenance of gene complements in localized populations indicates selective advantage. Furthermore, deletion haplotypes are not detrimental to plant health, since genes without adaptive value in alternate environments are eliminated from the genome. Deletion haplotypes appear to be a common form of allelic variation in plants, and we address the consequences on genome restructuring and gene evolution."

"16461721","abstracttext","Gibberella zeae (anamorph: Fusarium graminearum) is an important pathogen of maize, wheat, and rice. Colonies of G. zeae produce yellow-to-tan mycelia with the white-to-carmine red margins. In this study, we focused on nine putative open reading frames (ORFs) closely linked to PKS12 and GIP1, which are required for aurofusarin biosynthesis in G. zeae. Among them is an ORF designated GIP2 (for Gibberella zeae pigment gene 2), which encodes a putative protein of 398 amino acids that carries a Zn(II)2Cys6 binuclear cluster DNA-binding domain commonly found in transcription factors of yeasts and filamentous fungi. Targeted gene deletion and complementation analyses confirmed that GIP2 is required for aurofusarin biosynthesis. Expression of GIP2 in carrot medium correlated with aurofusarin production by G. zeae and was restricted to vegetative mycelia. Inactivation of the 10 contiguous genes in the DeltaGIP2 strain delineates an aurofusarin biosynthetic gene cluster. Overexpression of GIP2 in both the DeltaGIP2 and the wild-type strains increases aurofusarin production and reduces mycelial growth. Thus, GIP2 is a putative positive regulator of the aurofusarin biosynthetic gene cluster, and aurofusarin production is negatively correlated with vegetative growth by G. zeae."

Their phylogenetic affiliation was determined using 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and it was found that both strains (with 99.9 % gene sequence similarity between them) belonged to the Lactobacillus buchneri group, with nearest neighbours Lactobacillus hammesii and L. brevis (gene sequence similarities of 99.2 and 98.1 %, respectively). Further genotypic and phenotypic studies, including fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism, DNA-DNA hybridization and DNA G+C content, clearly demonstrated that the two strains represent a single novel taxon for which the name Lactobacillus parabrevis sp. nov. is proposed (type strain LMG 11984(T)=ATCC 53295(T))."

"16215730","abstracttext","The Argentinian wheat cultivar Sinvalocho MA carries the Lr3 gene for leaf rust resistance on distal chromosome 6BL. In this cultivar, 33 spontaneous susceptible lines were isolated and cytogenetically characterized by C-banding. The analysis revealed deletions on chromosome 6BL in most lines. One line was nulli-6B, two lines were ditelo 6BS, two, three, and ten lines had long terminal deletions of 40, 30, and 20%, respectively, three lines showed very small terminal deletions, and one line had an intercalary deletion of 11%. Physical mapping of 55 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers detected differences between deletions and led to the division of 6BL into seven bins delimited by deletion breakpoints. The most distal bin, with a length smaller than 5% of 6BL, contained 22 AFLP markers and the Lr3 gene. Polymorphism for nine AFLPs between Sinvalocho MA and the rust leaf susceptible cultivar Gamma 6 was used to construct a linkage map of Lr3. This gene is at a genetic distance of 0.9 cM from a group of seven closely linked AFLPs. The location of the gene in a high recombinogenic region indicated a physical distance of approximately 1 Mb to the markers."

"18958509","abstracttext","A major gene-rich region on the end of the long arm of Triticeae group 2 chromosomes exhibits high recombination frequencies, making it an attractive region for positional cloning. Traits known to be controlled by this region include chasmogamy/cleistogamy, frost tolerance at flowering, grain yield, head architecture, and resistance to Fusarium head blight and rusts. To assist these cloning efforts, we constructed detailed genetic maps of barley chromosome 2H, including 61 polymerase chain reaction markers. Colinearity with rice occurred in eight distinct blocks, including five blocks in the terminal gene-rich region. Alignment of rice sequences from the junctions of colinear chromosome segments provided no evidence for the involvement of long (>2.5 kb) inverted repeats in generating inversions. However, reuse of some junction sequences in two or three separate evolutionary breakage/fusion events was implicated, suggesting the presence of fragile sites. Sequencing across 91 gene fragments totaling 107 kb from four barley genotypes revealed the highest single nucleotide substitution and insertion-deletion polymorphism levels in the terminal regions of the chromosome arms. The maps will assist in the isolation of genes from the chromosome 2L gene-rich region in barley and wheat by providing markers and accelerating the identification of the corresponding points in the rice genome sequence."
"17066821","articletitle","Does R gene resistance allow wheat to prevent plant growth effects associated with Hessian fly (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) attack?"
"17066821","abstracttext","Resistance genes (R genes) are an important part of the plant's immune system. Among insects, the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), larva is the target of the greatest number of characterized R genes (H1-H32). The biochemical/molecular mechanism of R gene resistance to Hessian fly is not well understood. In the absence of an effective R gene, larvae caused extensive growth deficits (> 30 cm) in wheat seedlings. In the presence of one of three effective R genes, H6, H9, or H13, larvae caused small growth deficits (approximately 3-4 cm) in two leaves (third and fourth) that were actively growing during the first days of larval attack. After larvae died on R gene plants, the fifth leaf and tiller leaves exhibited small increases in growth (2-4 cm). Growth responses of susceptible and resistant plants diverged at a time when Hessian fly larvae were establishing a nutritive gall tissue at feeding sites. The results of this study support the hypothesis that R gene resistance cannot prevent initial larval attack, but, by stopping the formation of the larval gall, it prevents the most serious consequences of larval attack."
"17573804","articletitle","Illegitimate recombination is a major evolutionary mechanism for initiating size variation in plant resistance genes."
"17573804","abstracttext","Current models for the evolution of plant disease resistance (R) genes are based on mechanisms such as unequal crossing-over, gene conversion and point mutations as sources for genetic variability and the generation of new specificities. Size variation in leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains was previously mainly attributed to unequal crossing-over or template slippage between LRR units. Our analysis of 112 R genes and R gene analogs (RGAs) from 16 different gene lineages from monocots and dicots showed that individual LRR units are mostly too divergent to allow unequal crossing-over. We found that illegitimate recombination (IR) is the major mechanism that generates quasi-random duplications within the LRR domain. These initial duplications are required as seeds for subsequent unequal crossing-over events which cause the observed rapid increase or decrease in LRR repeat numbers. Ten of the 16 gene lineages studied contained such duplications, and in four of them the duplications served as a template for subsequent repeat amplification. Our analysis of Pm3-like genes from rice and three wheat species showed that such events can be traced back more than 50 million years. Thus, IR represents a major new evolutionary mechanism that is essential for the generation of molecular diversity in evolution of RGAs."

"17923480","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a plant disease with serious economic and health impacts. It is caused by fungal species belonging to the genus Fusarium and the mycotoxins they produce. Although it has proved difficult to combat this disease, one strategy that has been examined is the introduction of an indigenous fungal protective gene into cereals such as wheat barley and rice. Thus far the gene of choice has been tri101 whose gene product catalyzes the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme A to the C3 hydroxyl moiety of several trichothecene mycotoxins. In vitro this has been shown to reduce the toxicity of the toxins by approximately 100-fold but has demonstrated limited resistance to FHB in transgenic cereal. To understand the molecular basis for the differences between in vitro and in vivo resistance the three-dimensional structures and kinetic properties of two TRI101 orthologs isolated from Fusarium sporotrichioides and Fusarium graminearum have been determined. The kinetic results reveal important differences in activity of these enzymes toward B-type trichothecenes such as deoxynivalenol. These differences in activity can be explained in part by the three-dimensional structures for the ternary complexes for both of these enzymes with coenzyme A and trichothecene mycotoxins. The structural and kinetic results together emphasize that the choice of an enzymatic resistance gene in transgenic crop protection strategies must take into account the kinetic profile of the selected protein."

"17950638","abstracttext","The ascomycetous fungus Fusarium graminearum is an important plant pathogen causing Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and barley. To understand early developmental stages of this organism, we followed the germination of macroconidia microscopically to understand the timing of key events. These events, recorded after suspension of spores in liquid germination medium, included spore swelling at 2h, germination tube emergence and elongation from conidia at 8h and hyphal branching at 24h. To understand changes in gene expression during these developmental changes, RNA was isolated from spores and used to interrogate the F. graminearum Affymetrix GeneChip. RNAs corresponding to 5813 genes were detected in fresh spores and 5146, 5249 and 5993, respectively, in spores incubated in germination medium after 2, 8 or 24h (P<0.001). Gene expression data were used to predict the cellular and physiological state of each developmental stage for known processes. Predictions were confirmed microscopically for several previously unreported developmental events such as manifestation of peroxisomes in fresh spores and nuclear division resulting in binuclear cells within macroconidia prior to spore germination. Knowledge of stage-specific gene expression and changes in gene expression levels between developmental stages are an important first step to understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for spore germination and development."

"17978574","abstracttext","The genes encoding non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs), members of a small multigene family, show a complex pattern of expressional regulation, suggesting that some diversification may have resulted from changes in their expression after duplication. In this study, the evolution of nsLTP genes within the Poaceae family was characterized via a survey of the pseudogenes and unigenes encoding the nsLTP in rice pseudomolecules and the NCBI unigene database. nsLTP-rich regions were detected in the distal portions of rice chromosomes 11 and 12; these may have resulted from the most recent large segmental duplication in the rice genome. Two independent tandem duplications were shown to occur within the nsLTP-rich regions of rice. The genomic distribution of the nsLTP genes in the rice genome differs from that in wheat. This may be attributed to gene migration, chromosomal rearrangement, and/or differential gene loss. The genomic distribution pattern of nsLTP genes in the Poaceae family points to the existence of some differences among cereal nsLTP genes, all of which diverged from an ancient gene. The unigenes encoding nsLTPs in each cereal species are clustered into five groups. The somewhat different distribution of nsLTP-encoding EST clones between the groups across cereal species imply that independent duplication(s) followed by subfunctionalization (and/or neofunctionalization) of the nsLTP gene family in each species occurred during speciation."

Using DGGE and clone library analysis, we report here on eubacterial species diversity (16S rRNA gene) and diversity within two sets of gene products associated with microbial N acquisition: NifH (nitrogen fixation) and AmtB (ammonium transport). Comparisons were made within and between soils treated with mineral N fertilizer, farmyard manure or receiving no fertilizer. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene DGGE profiles showed no clear patterns to qualitatively distinguish bacterial community structure between the three different treatments (P > 0.05), with all samples containing a range of eubacterial taxa similar to those that are characteristic of soil bacteria reported elsewhere. Intra-plot heterogeneity was high and of a similar magnitude to that between treatments. This lack of qualitative between plot differences was echoed in the representative sequences of 16S rRNA, nifH, and amtB genes in the various samples. Taken together, both phylogenetic and functional gene analyses showed bacterial communities in the Broadbalk-trial soil were very stable and relatively non-responsive to long-term management of balanced fertilizer inputs."

"20376576","abstracttext","A cotton fiber cDNA, GhRING1, and its corresponding gene have been cloned and characterized. The GhRING1 gene encodes a RING-type ubiquitin ligase (E3) containing 338 amino acids (aa). The GhRING1 protein contains a RING finger motif with conserved cysteine and histine residues at the C-terminus, and is classified as a C(3)H(2)C(3)-type RING protein. Blast searches show that GhRING1 has the highest homology to At3g19950, a zinc finger family protein from Arabidopsis. Real time RT-PCR analysis indicates that the GhRING1 gene is expressed in cotton fibers in a developmental manner. The transcript level of GhRING1 gene reaches a maximum in elongating fibers at 15 days post-anthesis (DPA). In vitro auto-ubiquitination assays using wheat germ extract and a reconstitution system demonstrate that GhRING1 has the ubiquitin E3 ligase activity. The histochemical GUS assay was performed to analyze tissue specificity of the GhRING1 and At3g19950 promoters in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. The GUS assay shows that the promoter of At3g19950 is highly activated in leaves, roots, trichomes, and also in anthers and stigma of flowers. In contrast, the GUS expression directed by the GhRING1 promoter is only located at stipules and anthers. The expression pattern of GhRING1 suggests that protein ubiquitination and turnover may be involved in transition to different stages of cotton fiber development."

Thatcher derivatives 90RN2491 and RL6058 were intercrossed as well as crossed with the leaf rust and stripe rust susceptible Indian cultivar WL711. The F1, F2 and F3 generations from these crosses were assessed for rust severity against leaf rust race 77-5 and stripe rust race 46S119. The F2 and F3 generations from the crosses of RL6058 and 90RN2491 with WL711, segregated 15 resistant : 1 susceptible (F2) and 7 homozygous resistant : 8 segregating : 1 homozygous susceptible (F3) ratios, respectively, both for leaf rust and stripe rust severity. Therefore, partial resistance against each of the leaf rust and stripe rust races in both RL6058 and 90RN2491 is ascribed to two independently inherited dominant genes. One of the two genes for leaf rust and stripe rust resistance in 90RN2491 and RL6058 is Lr34 and the linked gene Yr18, respectively. The second leaf rust resistance gene in both the Thatcher lines segregated independently of stripe rust resistance. Therefore, it is not Lr34 and it remains unidentified."

The responses of germin and germin-like genes to salt stress vary in different plants. RT-PCR and in situ RNA hybridization methods were employed to analyze quantitative changes and to detect the localization pattern of germin gene products in salt-stressed and water-grown wheat embryos. Salt stress caused no quantitative changes in the synthesis of germin gene products. However, in situ RNA hybridization revealed changes in the expression site of germin gene products. Coleorhiza cells were found to be the site of germin accumulation in water-grown embryos; however, in salt-stressed embryos, germin mRNA accumulated in coleoptile cells instead of coleorhiza tissue."

"19280237","abstracttext","Flowering time represents an important adaptive trait for temperate cereal crops and may also impact on frost damage in cereal reproductive tissues by enabling escape or by influencing accumulation of genuine tolerance. The Flowering time-2L (Flt-2L) quantitative trait locus (QTL) on the distal end of barley chromosome arm 2HL overlaps with QTL for rachis internode length and reproductive frost damage. Flt-2L was also found to be associated with plant height. By combining marker analysis with phenotyping in progeny families of selected Amagi Nijo x WI2585 F(6) recombinants, we were able to map quantitative flowering time, rachis internode length, and plant height effects on 2HL as discrete Mendelian traits. The three developmental characters showed codominant modes of expression and perfectly cosegregated with one another in a 1.3-cM marker interval, indicating control by the same gene or closely linked genes. Twelve genes were identified in the related intervals in the rice and Brachypodium distachyon genomes. The HvAP2 gene cosegregated with Flt-2L and represents a plausible candidate for Flt-2L, since it is highly similar to the wheat domestication gene Q which has similar developmental effects. These data will contribute to isolation of the Flt-2L gene(s) and help establish the basis of the frost damage QTL."

"20709427","abstracttext","Pathogen attack triggers a multifaceted defence response in plants that includes the accumulation of pathogenesis-related proteins and their corresponding transcripts. One of these transcripts encodes for WIR1, a small glycine- and proline-rich protein of unknown function that appears to be specific to grass species. Here we describe members of the HvWIR1 multigene family of barley with respect to phylogenetic relationship, transcript regulation, co-localization with quantitative trait loci for resistance to the barley powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f.sp. hordei, the association of single nucleotide polymorphisms or gene haplotypes with resistance, as well as phenotypic effects of gene silencing by RNAi. HvWIR1 is encoded by a multigene family of moderate complexity that splits up into two major clades, one of those being also represented by previously described cDNA sequences from wheat. All analysed WIR1 transcripts accumulated in response to powdery mildew attack in leaves and all mapped WIR1 genes were associated with quantitative trait loci for resistance to B. graminis. Moreover, single nucleotide polymorphisms or haplotypes of WIR1 members were associated with quantitative resistance of barley to B. graminis, and transient WIR1 gene silencing affected the interaction of epidermal cells with the pathogen. The presented data provide convergent evidence for a role of the HvWIR1a gene and possibly other family members, during the interaction of barley with B. graminis."

"21413710","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum (FG) is a serious plant pathogen causing huge losses in global production of wheat and other cereals. Tri5-gene encoded trichodiene synthase is the first key enzyme for biosynthesis of trichothecene mycotoxins in FG. To further our understandings of FG metabolism which is essential for developing novel strategies for controlling FG, we conducted a comprehensive investigation on the metabolic changes caused by Tri5-deletion by comparing metabolic differences between the wild-type FG5035 and an FG strain, Tri5(-), with Tri5 deleted. NMR methods identified more than 50 assigned fungal metabolites. Combined metabonomic and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that Tri5 deletion caused significant and comprehensive metabolic changes for FG apart from mycotoxin biosynthesis. These changes involved both carbon and nitrogen metabolisms including alterations in GABA shunt, TCA cycle, shikimate pathway, and metabolisms of lipids, amino acids, inositol, choline, pyrimidine, and purine. The hexose transporter has also been affected. These findings have shown that Tri5 gene deletion induces widespread changes in FG primary metabolism and demonstrated the combination of NMR-based metabonomics and qRT-PCR analyses as a useful way to understand the systems metabolic changes resulting from a single specific gene knockout in an eukaryotic genome and thus Tri5 gene functions."

"22384315","abstracttext","Interspecific hybridization has a much greater effect than chromosome doubling on gene expression; however, the associations between homeologous gene expression changes and polyhaploidization had rarely been addressed. In this study, cDNA-single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was applied to measure the expression of 30 homeologous transcripts in naturally occurring haploid (ABD, 2n = 21) and its polyploid maternal parent Yumai 21A (AABBDD, 2n = 42) in wheat. Only one gene (TC251989) showed preferentially silenced homoeoalleles in haploids. Further analyses of 24 single-copy genes known to be silenced in the root and/or leaf also found no evidence of homeologous silencing in 1-month-old haploids and two ESTs (BF484100 and BF473379) exhibit different expression patterns between 4-month-old haploids and hexaploids. Global analysis of the gene expression patterns using the Affymetrix GeneChip showed that of the 55,052 genes probed, only about 0.11% in the shoots and 0.25% in the roots were activated by polyhaploidization. The results demonstrate that activation and silencing of homoeoalleles were not widespread in haploid seedlings."

"23353766","abstracttext","Salt stress affects plant growth and development, and limits the productivity of crops. Sheepgrass can grow well under various environmental and soil conditions and is a good wild resource in Triticeae. Using 454 high throughout sequencing technique, a large number of salt stress responsive genes have been picked out from sheepgrass. In this study, a novel salt-induced gene and its promoter were cloned and the gene was designated as LcSAIN2 (Leymus chinensissalt-induced 2). Bioinformatics analysis predicted that LcSAIN2 has one transmembrane helix and is localized in nucleus. Experiments of subcellular localization in tobacco leaf cells also indicated that it was mainly localized in nucleus. Several stress responsive elements were found in the promoter region of the LcSAIN2 gene. The expression analysis confirmed that LcSAIN2 was induced by salinity, PEG, ABA, and cold stresses, especially by high salinity. Overexpression of LcSAIN2 in Arabidopsis enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic plants by accumulating osmolytes, such as soluble sugars and free proline, and improving the expression levels of some stress-responsive transcription factors and key genes. Our results suggest that LcSAIN2 might play an important positive modulation role in salt stress tolerance and be a candidate gene utilized for enhancing stress tolerance in wheat and other crops."

"23695503","abstracttext","Previously, we identified >1,500 genes that were induced by high salt stress in sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis, Gramineae: Triticeae) when comparing the changes in their transcription levels in response to high salt stress by next-generation sequencing. Among the identified genes, a gene of unknown function (designated as Leymus chinensis salt-induced 1, LcSAIN1) showed a high sequence identity to its homologs from wheat, Hordeum vulgare and Oryza sativa, but LcSAIN1 and its homologs produce hypothetical proteins with no conserved functional domains. Transcription of the LcSAIN1 gene was up-regulated by various stresses. The overexpression of LcSAIN1 in Arabidopsis and rice increased the greening rate of cotyledons, the fresh weight, root elongation, plant height and the plant survival rate when compared with control plants and conferred a tolerance against salt stress. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that LcSAIN1 is localized predominantly in the nucleus. Our results show that the LcSAIN1 gene might play an important positive modulation role in increasing the expression of transcription factors (MYB2 and DREB2A) and functional genes (P5CS and RAB18) in transgenic plants under salt stress and that it augments stress tolerance through the accumulation of compatible solutes (proline and soluble sugar) and the alleviation of changes in reactive oxygen species. The LcSAIN1 gene could be a potential resource for engineering salinity tolerance in important crop species."

"23954326","abstracttext","Both genome-wide transcriptomic surveys of the mRNA expression profiles and virus-induced gene silencing-based molecular studies of target gene during virus-plant interaction involve the precise estimation of the transcript abundance. Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the most widely adopted technique for mRNA quantification. In order to obtain reliable quantification of transcripts, identification of the best reference genes forms the basis of the preliminary work. Nevertheless, the stability of internal controls in virus-infected monocots needs to be fully explored. In this work, the suitability of ten housekeeping genes (ACT, EF1α, FBOX, GAPDH, GTPB, PP2A, SAND, TUBβ, UBC18 and UK) for potential use as reference genes in qPCR were investigated in five different monocot plants (Brachypodium, barley, sorghum, wheat and maize) under infection with different viruses including Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV), Brome mosaic virus (BMV), Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) and Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV). By using three different algorithms, the most appropriate reference genes or their combinations were identified for different experimental sets and their effectiveness for the normalisation of expression studies were further validated by quantitative analysis of a well-studied PR-1 gene. These results facilitate the selection of desirable reference genes for more accurate gene expression studies in virus-infected monocots."

"24221433","abstracttext","Pm10 and Pm15, resistance genes to Erysiphe graminis f. sp. agropyri, are located on the D genome of common wheat. It was determined whether or not they were carried by existing lines of the D genome donor, Aegilops squarrosa, using the gene-for-gene relationship. Two lines of Ae. squarrosa tested (one was var. meyeri and the other was var. anathera) were susceptible to culture Tk-1 of E. graminis f. sp. tritici and were highly resistant to culture Ak-1 of E. graminis f. sp. agropyri. The two lines were inoculated with an F1 population derived from the cross Ak-1 × Tk-1. Comparative analyses of the segregation patterns revealed that Ppm10 and Ppm15, avirulence genes corresponding to Pm10 and Pm15, respectively, are involved in the avirulence of Ak-1 on var. meyeri and var. anathera, respectively. According to the gene-for-gene relationship, var. meyeri and var. anathera were inferred to carry Pm10 and Pm15, respectively. Analysis with a synthetic hexaploid confirmed the inference."

"24247780","abstracttext","The phenology and build-up of spikelet number under 10 h day-length were studied in five wheat lines: the multispikelet line 'Noa', the regular line 'Mara', the F1 hybrid between them and monosomics 2D of 'Mara' and of this hybrid (lacking the 2D chromosome of 'Mara'). 'Noa' had a longer spike development phase, a higher initial number of spikelet primordia and a slower rate of spikelet production than 'Mara'. The F1 hybrid was similar to 'Noa' in its high initial number of spikelets and to 'Mara' in its high rate of spikelet production. This hybrid had a shorter spikelet phase than both parents. Deletion of one dose of the 'Mara' 2D chromosome from either 'Mara' or the F1 hybrid caused a reduction in the rate of spikelet production and an increase in the duration of the spikelet phase. These effects were due to the reduced dosage of the 2D chromosome. However, in the F1 hybrid this deletion also caused an increase in the spike development phase - an indication that 'Noa' carries on its 2D chromosome a recessive gene for late heading date which acts on the spike development phase. This gene of 'Noa' is independent of the day-length sensitive gene ppd, and is different from 'Noa's dominant gene for large initial number of spikelets."

Three leaf rust resistance genes were identified in the durable leaf rust resistant Argentinean wheat variety Sinvalocho MA: the seedling resistance gene Lr3 on distal 6BL and two adult plant resistance genes, LrSV1 and LrSV2, on chromosomes 2DS and 3BS, respectively. To develop a high-resolution genetic map for LrSV2, 10 markers were genotyped on 343 F2 individuals from a cross between Sinvalocho MA and Gama6. The closest co-dominant markers on both sides of the gene (3 microsatellites and 2 STMs) were analyzed on 965 additional F2s from the same cross. Microsatellite marker cfb5010 cosegregated with LrSV2 whereas flanking markers were found at 1 cM distal and at 0.3 cM proximal to the gene. SSR markers designed from the sequences of cv Chinese Spring BAC clones spanning the LrSV2 genetic interval were tested on the recombinants, allowing the identification of microsatellite swm13 at 0.15 cM distal to LrSV2.

"25912045","articletitle","Evolution of gene expression after gene amplification."
"25912045","abstracttext","We took a rather unique approach to investigate the conservation of gene expression of prolamin storage protein genes across two different subfamilies of the Poaceae. We took advantage of oat plants carrying single maize chromosomes in different cultivars, called oat-maize addition (OMA) lines, which permitted us to determine whether regulation of gene expression was conserved between the two species. We found that γ-zeins are expressed in OMA7.06, which carries maize chromosome 7 even in the absence of the trans-acting maize prolamin-box-binding factor (PBF), which regulates their expression. This is likely because oat PBF can substitute for the function of maize PBF as shown in our transient expression data, using a γ-zein promoter fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). Despite this conservation, the younger, recently amplified prolamin genes in maize, absent in oat, are not expressed in the corresponding OMAs. However, maize can express the oldest prolamin gene, the wheat high-molecular weight glutenin Dx5 gene, even when maize Pbf is knocked down (through PbfRNAi), and/or another maize transcription factor, Opaque-2 (O2) is knocked out (in maize o2 mutant). Therefore, older genes are conserved in their regulation, whereas younger ones diverged during evolution and eventually acquired a new repertoire of suitable transcriptional activators."

"28095206","abstracttext","Genetic resistance in crops is a cornerstone of disease management in agriculture. Such genetic resistance is often rapidly broken due to selection for virulence in the pathogen population. Here, we ask whether there are strategies that can prolong the useful life of plant resistance genes. In a modeling study, we compared four deployment strategies: gene pyramiding, sequential use, simultaneous use, and a mixed strategy. We developed a spatially explicit model for France and parameterized it for the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (causing wheat yellow rust) to test management strategies in a realistic spatial setting. We found that pyramiding two new resistance genes in one variety was the most durable solution only when the virulent genotype had to emerge by mutation. Deploying single-gene-resistant varieties concurrently with the pyramided variety eroded the durability of the gene pyramid. We found that continuation of deployment of varieties with broken-down resistance prolonged the useful life of simultaneous deployment of four single-gene-resistant varieties versus sequential use. However, when virulence was already present in the pathogen population, durability was low and none of the deployment strategies had effect. These results provide guidance on effective strategies for using resistance genes in crop protection practice."

"28121239","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici is an ascomycete fungus that causes Septoria tritici blotch, a globally distributed foliar disease on wheat. Z. tritici populations are highly polymorphic and exhibit significant quantitative variation for virulence. Despite its importance, the genes responsible for quantitative virulence in this pathogen remain largely unknown. We investigated the expression profiles of four Z. tritici strains differing in virulence in an experiment conducted under uniform environmental conditions. Transcriptomes were compared at four different infection stages to characterize the regulation of gene families thought to be involved in virulence and to identify new virulence factors. The major components of the fungal infection transcriptome showed consistent expression profiles across strains. However, strain-specific regulation was observed for many genes, including some encoding putative virulence factors. We postulate that strain-specific regulation of virulence factors can determine the outcome of Z. tritici infections. We show that differences in gene expression may be major determinants of virulence variation among Z. tritici strains, adding to the already known contributions to virulence variation based on differences in gene sequence and gene presence/absence polymorphisms."

"32533016","abstracttext","RNA viruses exist as populations of genome variants. Virus-infected plants accumulate 21-24 nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) derived from viral RNA (virus-derived siRNAs) through gene silencing. This paper describes the profile of mutations in virus-derived siRNAs for three members of the family Potyviridae: Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV), Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) and Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). For TuMV in Arabidopsis thaliana, profiles were obtained for mechanically inoculated rosette leaves and systemically infected cauline leaves and inflorescence. Results are consistent with selection pressure on the viral genome imposed by local and systemic movement. By genetically removing gene silencing in the plant and silencing suppression in the virus, our results showed that antiviral gene silencing imposes selection in viral populations. Mutations in siRNAs derived from a PRSV coat protein transgene in the absence of virus replication showed the contribution of cellular RNA-dependent RNA polymerases to the generation of mutations in virus-derived siRNAs. Collectively, results are consistent with two sources of mutations in virus-derived siRNAs: viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases responsible for virus replication and cellular RNA-dependent RNA polymerases responsible for gene silencing amplification."

Cysteine (C)-rich receptor-like kinases (CRKs) are an important class of RLK that play vital roles in disease resistance and cell death in plants. Genome-wide analyses of CRK genes have been carried out in Arabidopsis and rice, while functional characterization of some CRKs has been carried out in wheat and tomato in addition to Arabidopsis . A comprehensive analysis of the CRK gene family in leguminous crops has not yet been conducted, and our understanding of their roles in symbiosis is rather limited. Here, we report the comprehensive analysis of the Phaseolus CRK gene family, including identification, sequence similarity, phylogeny, chromosomal localization, gene structures, transcript expression profiles, and in silico promoter analysis. Forty-six CRK homologs were identified and phylogenetically clustered into five groups. Expression analysis suggests that PvCRK genes are differentially expressed in both vegetative and reproductive tissues. Further, transcriptomic analysis revealed that shared and unique CRK genes were upregulated during arbuscular mycorrhizal and rhizobial symbiosis. Overall, the systematic analysis of the PvCRK gene family provides valuable information for further studies on the biological roles of CRKs in various Phaseolus tissues during diverse biological processes, including Phaseolus -mycorrhiza/rhizobia symbiosis."

A new stripe rust resistance gene with moderate seedling and adult plant resistance was mapped using an F 5 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from the cross of the resistant parent 'Almop' with the susceptible parent 'Avocet'. The parents and RILs were phenotyped for seedling stripe rust response variation in a greenhouse and in field trials at Toluca, Mexico for 2 years. Almop showed moderate levels of resistance at both seedling and adult plant stages compared with the highly susceptible response of Avocet. The distribution of homozygous resistant, homozygous susceptible, and segregating RILs conformed to segregation at a single locus. Seedlings and adult plant responses were correlated, indicating that the same gene conferred resistance at both stages. A bulk segregant analysis approach with widely distributed simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers mapped the resistance gene to the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 4A. The SSR marker wmc776 cosegregated with this gene, whereas markers wmc219 and wmc313 were tightly linked and both located at 0.6 centimorgans. The resistance locus was designated Yr60."

Current understanding of the genetic components and the environmental cues which influence development and pathogenicity of this fungus is limited. The velvet B gene, velB , has conserved roles in development, secondary metabolism, and pathogenicity across fungi. The function of this gene is best characterised in the model ascomycete fungus Aspergillus nidulans , where it is involved in co-ordinating the light response with downstream processes. There is limited knowledge of the role of light in Z. tritici , and of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the light response. We show that Z. tritici is able to detect light, and that the vegetative morphology of this fungus is influenced by light conditions. We also identify and characterise the Z. tritici velB gene, ZtvelB , by gene disruption. The Δ ztvelB deletion mutants were fixed in a filamentous growth pattern and are unable to form yeast-like vegetative cells. Their morphology was similar under light and dark conditions, showing an impairment in light-responsive growth. In addition, the Δ ztvelB mutants produced abnormal pycnidia that were impaired in macropycnidiospore production but could still produce viable infectious micropycnidiospores. Our results show that ZtvelB is required for yeast-like growth and asexual sporulation in Z. tritici , and we provide evidence for a role of ZtvelB in integrating light perception and developmental regulation in this important plant pathogenic fungus."

MED0031 is a mutant identified previously from ethyl methane sulfonate treatment of diploid wheat accession TA2726, showing brittleness in both stem and leaf. In microscopic and histological observations, the mutant was found to have less large vascular bundles per unit area, a thinner sclerenchyma cell wall, and a broader parenchyma, compared with the wild type. The mutated gene, TmBr1, was mapped to a 0.056 cM interval on chromosome 5A m . This gene was cloned using a MapRseq approach that searched the candidate gene through combination of the prior target gene mapping information with SNP calling and discovery of differentially expressed genes from RNA_seq data of the wild type and a BC 3 F 2 bulk showing the mutant phenotype. TmBr1 encodes a COBL protein and a nonsense mutation within the region coding for the conserved COBRA domain caused premature translation termination. Introduction of TmBr1 to Arabidopsis AtCOBL4 mutant rescued the phenotype, demonstrating their functional conservation. Apart from the effect on cellulose content, the TmBr1 mutation might modulate synthesis of noncellulosic polysaccharide pectin as well. Application of the MapRseq approach to isolation of genes present in recombination cold spots and complicated genomes was discussed."

"31565749","abstracttext","The closely related sulphonamide safeners, metcamifen and cyprosulfamide, were tested for their ability to protect rice from clodinafop-propargyl, a herbicide normally used in wheat. While demonstrating that both compounds were equally bioavailable in planta, only metcamifen prevented clodinafop from damaging seedlings, and this was associated with the enhanced detoxification of the herbicide. Transcriptome studies in rice cultures demonstrated that whereas cyprosulfamide had a negligible effect on gene expression over a 4 h exposure, metcamifen perturbed the abundance of 590 transcripts. Changes in gene expression with metcamifen could be divided into three phases, corresponding to inductions occurring over 30 min, 1.5 h and 4 h. The first phase of gene induction was dominated by transcription factors and proteins of unknown function, the second by genes involved in herbicide detoxification, while the third was linked to cellular homeostasis. Analysis of the inducible genes suggested that safening elicited similar gene families to those associated with specific biotic and abiotic stresses, notably those elicited by abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmonate. Subsequent experiments with safener biomarker genes induced in phase 1 and 2 in rice cell cultures provided further evidence of similarities in signalling processes elicited by metcamifen and salicylic acid."

"7032597","abstracttext","Use of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase for in vitro transcription of chromatin results in the formation of double-stranded RNA molecules, which consist of a strand of endogenous mRNA and a complementary strand of de novo synthesized RNA. Unless the duplex structures are dissociated prior to isolation of the in vitro transcripts on sulfhydryl agarose columns, the endogenous mRNA can result in over-estimates of in vitro gene-specific transcription. Substitution of wheat germ RNA polymerase B for the bacterial enzyme overcomes this artifact. When mouse fetal liver chromatin is used as template, most of the mRNA synthesized by the plant enzyme is in a single-stranded form. More importantly, this synthesis is directed by a DNA template. Hybridization studies suggest that in vitro transcription of chromatin with wheat germ RNA polymerase B maintains some fidelity to genetic restrictions which operate in vivo."

"2843806","articletitle","Chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase: the product of a mosaic gene."
"2843806","abstracttext","We show here that light stimulates the expression of nuclear genes in wheat leaves for chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase) and describe a sequence of amino acids in this enzyme which may be responsible, via thioredoxin, for the light regulation of its activity. This data results from (a) our isolation and characterization of a cDNA of this enzyme which contains its entire coding sequence, and (b) our use of this cDNA as a probe to detect mRNA levels in wheat plants subjected to different light regimes. The similarity in amino acid sequence of the encoded enzyme from diverse sources suggests that the FBPase genes all had a common origin. However, their control sequences have been adjusted so that they are appropriately expressed and their coding sequences modified so that the enzymic activity of their products are suitably regulated in the particular cellular environment in which they must function. The light-activated regulatory sequences in the gene for the chloroplast protein have probably come together by a shuffling of DNA segments."
"7529870","articletitle","A gene proposed to encode a transmembrane domain of an ABC transporter is expressed in wheat mitochondria."
"7529870","abstracttext","In a study of transcribed regions of the wheat mitochondrial genome, we identified an open reading frame of 720 bp, which was consequently designated orf240. The amino acid sequence deduced from orf240 shows a high level of similarity with HelC, a protein essential for c-type cytochrome biogenesis in the photosynthetic purple bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. HelC is part of a putative heme ABC transporter. An open reading frame homologous to orf240 is present in the mitochondrial genome of Marchantia polymorpha. The wheat gene is expressed as an mRNA of 2.8 kb, which is further processed to smaller transcripts. The transcript is highly edited, with 36 C to U modifications found in the coding region of all cDNAs sequenced. RNA editing is responsible for changes in 14% of the amino acids specified by the transcript."
"8766725","articletitle","Identification and characterization of a low temperature regulated gene encoding an actin-binding protein from wheat."
"8766725","abstracttext","A cDNA corresponding to a putative actin-binding protein was cloned from a cold-acclimated wheat cDNA library. The cDNA, designated Wcor719, encodes a polypeptide of 142 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 15.8 kDa and a pI of 4.27. The protein has the two conserved domains identified as actin and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) binding sites found in members of the cofilin family. Northern analyses revealed that Wcor719 transcript accumulation is rapid and strongly up-regulated by low temperature. This accumulation was greater in the tolerant winter wheat and rye species compared to the less tolerant ones. The rapidity of transcript induction and the significant homology with actin-binding proteins (ABP) from different organisms suggest that the product of this gene might be involved in the dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton during low temperature acclimation. It may also serve as a key factor in the signal transduction pathway during cold acclimation."

"9291122","abstracttext","An inducible acetylesterase was purified from the culture medium of Aspergillus awamori strain IFO4033 growing on wheat-bran culture by ion-exchange, gel-filtration and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The purified enzyme had an Mr of 31000 and contained Asn-linked oligosaccharides. The enzyme liberated acetic acid from wheat bran, hydrolysed only alpha-naphthyl acetate and propionate when aromatic esters were used for the substrate, and was tentatively classified as a carboxylic esterase (EC 3.1.1.1). The gene encoding acetylesterase was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence showed that acetylesterase was produced as a 304-amino-acid-residue precursor, which was converted post-translationally into a 275-amino-acid-residue mature protein. Part of the sequence of acetylesterase was similar to the region near the active-site serine of lipases of Geotrichum candidum and Candida cylindracea. A unique site of putative Asn-linked oligosaccharides was presented."

"11255017","abstracttext","The organisation of the durum wheat genomic sequence (3.5 kb) coding for protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), deduced by comparison between genomic fragments and cDNA sequences (1.5 kb) isolated from immature caryopses, is described. The gene structure consists of ten exons and nine introns. The presence of consensus sequences involved in splicing, such as intron-exon junctions and branchpoint, has been observed and discussed. Although the deduced wheat PDI amino acid sequence exhibited an overall identity of only 31% to that of human PDI, their modular architecture in terms of number, size, location and secondary structure-propensities of the constituent domains are remarkably similar. The comparison of the amino acid sequences with the eight available plant PDI-like sequences showed a high identity with four of them and low with the remaining ones. Analyses of transcription levels showed that the PDI mRNA was present in all analysed tissues, with much higher expression in immature caryopses."

"11432931","abstracttext","A critical step in the development of Agrobacterium tumifaciens-mediated transformation is the establishment of optimal conditions for T-DNA delivery into tissue from which whole plants can be regenerated. The efficient transformation of inflorescence tissue from 'Baldus', a commercial wheat variety, using the Agrobacterium strain AGLI harbouring the binary vector pAL156 is reported here. The effects of various factors on delivery and the transient expression of the uidA gene were studied including the duration of preculture, vacuum infiltration, the effect of sonication treatments, and Agrobacterium cell density. Optimal T-DNA delivery (as measured by uidA activity) was obtained from inflorescence tissues precultured for 21 d and sonicated. Increasing Agrobacterium cell density, the duration of inoculation/co-cultivation, and vacuum pressure, up to a threshold, increased uidA expression. The investigation of factors that influence T-DNA delivery is an important first step in the utilization of Agrobacterium in the transformation of immature wheat inflorescence tissue."

"10790409","abstracttext","A detailed RFLP map was constructed of the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 1D of Aegilops tauschii, the diploid D-genome donor species of hexaploid wheat. Ae. tauschii was used to overcome some of the limitations commonly associated with molecular studies of wheat such as low levels of DNA polymorphism. Detection of multiple loci by most RFLP probes suggests that gene duplication events have occurred throughout this chromosomal region. Large DNA fragments isolated from a BAC library of Ae. tauschii were used to determine the relationship between physical and genetic distance at seed storage protein loci located at the distal end of chromosome 1DS. Highly recombinogenic regions were identified where the ratio of physical to genetic distance was estimated to be <20 kb/cM. These results are discussed in relation to the genome-wide estimate of the relationship between physical and genetic distance."
"12553935","articletitle","Deletion of the SNP1 trypsin protease from Stagonospora nodorum reveals another major protease expressed during infection."
"12553935","abstracttext","The wheat fungal pathogen Stagonospora nodorum produces an extracellular trypsin-like protease, SNP1, during early stages of hyphal growth on the surface of host leaves and during penetration. Variation of SNP1 mRNA levels and enzyme activity during infection, were correlated with levels of aggressiveness of three wild-type isolates. SNP1 was deleted in two wild-type isolates using a gene replacement strategy. SNP1-deleted mutants completely lacked trypsin activity in vitro and on inoculated wheat leaves, but were not reduced in pathogenicity. SNP1-deleted mutants still have 50% of the total alkaline protease activity of wild-type. This residual activity comes from a previously undetected alkaline protease with subtilisin-like substrate and inhibitor specificities, which is produced in vitro and on host leaves. We hypothesize that this subtilisin protease may act in concert with SNP1 and may compensate for the loss of trypsin protease activity in the SNP1-deletion mutants."
"11958460","articletitle","A New York isolate of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus differs considerably from the Nebraska type strain in the nucleotide sequences of various coding regions but not in the deduced amino acid sequences."
"11958460","abstracttext","A wheat-infecting furovirus found in Tompkins County, New York, U.S.A. was identified as a strain of Soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) by means of sequence analyses of portions of its RNA 1 and 2. The nucleotide sequences of several of its genes differed by c. 9 to 12% from those of the corresponding genome regions of the Nebraska type strain of SBWMV. The deduced amino acid sequences of the putative translation products, however, suggested much closer relationships. Thus, the amino acid sequences of the coat proteins of the two virus strains were 100% identical despite the fact that their coding regions differed in as many as 68 nucleotide positions. The New York (NY) strain of SBWMV is possibly closely related to an isolate from Illinois for which so far only the nucleotide sequences of its coat protein gene and the 5' untranslated region of its RNA 2 are known."

"12596005","abstracttext","The gene encoding high-molecular-weight (HMW) subunit 1Bx20 was isolated from durum wheat cv. Lira. It encodes a mature protein of 774 amino acid residues with an M(r) of 83,913. Comparison with the sequence of subunit 1Bx7 showed over 96% identity, the main difference being the substitution of two cysteine residues in the N-terminal domain of subunit 1Bx7 with tyrosine residues in 1Bx20. Comparison of the structures and stabilities of the two subunits purified from wheat using Fourier-transform infra-red and circular dichroism spectroscopy showed no significant differences. However, incorporation of subunit 1Bx7 into a base flour gave increased dough strength and stability measured by Mixograph analysis, while incorporation of subunit 1Bx20 resulted in small positive or negative effects on the parameters measured. It is concluded that the different effects of the two subunits could relate to the differences in their cysteine contents, thereby affecting the cross-linking and hence properties of the glutenin polymers."

"12669793","abstracttext","We describe a flexible and general strategy for converting a wheat RFLP-based assay into a PCR-based sequence-tagged site (STS), and have applied it to derive markers for a powdery mildew resistance gene present in a wheat-rye translocation. The concept is based on deriving PCR primers that amplify all of the homoeoloci defined by a single-copy cDNA sequence, and separating the resulting mixture of homoeoamplicons via single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) gels, which are able to detect minor differences between related DNA sequences. After their separation, the individual homoeoamplicons were sequenced and these were used to define nucleotide polymorphisms that could be exploited to design locus-specific PCR primers. In one case, we were able to demonstrate that the assay was allele specific."

"12582606","abstracttext","Genotype-specific gene expression in response to vernalization in common wheat was examined by the differential display method. Two near-isogenic lines of Vrn-A1 ( Vrn-A1 for the spring type and vrn-A1 for the winter type) were treated by vernalization of developing embryos in detached-ear cultures. This treatment was effective to promote vrn-A1 genotypes to head at a time equivalent to that of Vrn-A1. Differential cDNA fragments were isolated by the RT-PCR method from embryos subjected to vernalization treatments for 2- and 4-weeks at DAP10 and DAP20 stages, respectively. Among 110 differential cDNA fragments isolated, 48 were examined for their chromosomal locations and designated as wec ( wheat- embryo cold treatment) genes. Seven wec genes showed genotype-specific expression in response to vernalization. The statistical analysis utilizing two recombinant inbred lines showed that four wec genes were significantly associated with heading factors."

"12582674","abstracttext","To clarify the composition of low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GSs) in a soft wheat cultivar, we cloned and characterized LMW-GS genes from a cDNA library and genomic DNA in Norin 61. Based on alignment of the conserved N- and C- terminal domains of the deduced amino-acid sequences, these genes are classified into 12 groups. One of these groups (group 5), the corresponding gene of which has not been reported previously, contains two additional hydrophobic amino-acid clusters interrupting the N-terminal repetitive domain. Other groups (groups 11 and 12), which were not identified in other cultivars as a protein product, showed all eight cysteines in the C-terminal conserved domain. With specific primer sets for these groups it was revealed that Glu-D3 and Glu-A3 encoded the former and the latter, respectively. Both groups of genes were expressed in immature seeds. The presence of these groups of LMW-GSs may affect the dough strength of soft wheat."

"12721636","abstracttext","Genetic analysis of resistance to leaf rust in rye (Puccinia recondita f. sp. secalis) led to the identification of two dominant resistance genes, Pr1 and Pr2. Both genes proved to be effective against a local leaf-rust population as well as a subset of single-pustule isolates (SPIs) the latter of which comprised SPIs with very high virulence complexity. Resistance conferred by Pr1 and Pr2 was expressed in detached-leaf tests of seedlings as well as in field tests of adult plants. Molecular marker analysis allowed us to map Pr1 in the proximal part of rye chromosome 6RL, whereas Pr2 was assigned to the distal part of chromosome 7RL. These results are discussed in view of homoeology relationships among Triticeae. A proposal is submitted for the designation of resistance genes to rye leaf rust which would avoid interference with existing gene-symboling in respect to wheat leaf-rust resistances introgressed from rye into wheat or triticale."

"15806348","abstracttext","Grain hardness is an important quality characteristic of wheat grain, and considerable research effort has focused on characterising the genetic and biochemical basis underlying the hardness phenotype. Previous research has shown that the predominant difference between hard and soft seeds is linked to the puroindoline (PIN) proteins. In this study the near-isogenic lines of Heron and Falcon, which differ only in the grain hardness character, were compared using a cDNA microarray consisting of approximately 5,000 unique cDNA clones that were isolated from wheat and barley endosperm tissue. Our analysis showed that major differences in gene expression were evident for puroindoline-a (Pina), with a minor but not consistent change in the expression of puroindoline-b (Pinb). These observations were confirmed using a 16,000 unique cDNA microarray in a comparison of hard wheats with either the Pina null or Pinb mutation."

In view to probe the lipid binding properties of the wheat nsLTP1, mutant variants may represent a powerful tool. To this end, a synthetic gene, encoding a mature wheat nsLTP1 polypeptide, was designed to ensure high level expression in Escherichia coli. The bacterial expression host strain, a translational fusion strategy, and convenient cleavage and purification procedures were optimized to produce in standard fermentation conditions, a significant amount (15 mg/L final yield), of a soluble and correctly folded recombinant nsLTP1. This highly amenable expression system is helpful in order to investigate structure-activity relationships of plant nsLTP."

The three sequences showed a very high conservation of the coding region and of the exon/intron structure, which consisted of ten exons. The comparison of wheat sequences with those of rice and Arabidopsis showed a significant conservation of the exon/intron structure across the three species. The expression of each gene was analysed by RT-PCR in different plant tissues (roots, coleoptiles, spikelets, leaves and developing caryopses). All the genes showed a higher expression in developing caryopses than in other analysed tissues, wherein some differences were detected. The promoter sequences of the three genes possessed some regulatory motifs typical of endosperm specific expression."

"16347609","abstracttext","Xanthomonas campestris pv. translucens is the causal agent of bacterial leaf streak of cereal grains and grasses, and individual strains within the pathovar differ in their host range among the cereals. Coinoculation of a wide-host-range and a narrow-host-range strain resulted in the wide-host-range reaction. Transposon and chemical mutagenesis of the wide-host-range strain Xct4, pathogenic on barley, wheat, rye, and triticale, resulted in variants with reduced host range. When pathogenicity was inactivated independently for barley, wheat, triticale, and rye, wild-type symptoms were retained on the other members in the host range. Testing of some host range mutants on additional varieties of the cereals indicated some cultivar specificity. In addition, mutants nonpathogenic on combinations of the hosts or on all hosts were isolated. This suggests that there are independent positive factors determining host range in this species, rather than an avirulence gene system such as those determining race specificity in other plant pathogens."

"17107817","abstracttext","MgMfs1, a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) gene from the wheat pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola, was identified in expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries. The encoded protein has high homology to members of the drug:H(+) antiporter efflux family of MFS transporters with 14 predicted transmembrane spanners (DHA14), implicated in mycotoxin secretion and multidrug resistance. Heterologous expression of MgMfs1 in a hypersensitive Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain resulted in a strong decrease in sensitivity of this organism to a broad range of unrelated synthetic and natural toxic compounds. The sensitivity of MgMfs1 disruption mutants of M. graminicola to most of these compounds was similar when compared to the wild-type but the sensitivity to strobilurin fungicides and the mycotoxin cercosporin was increased. Virulence of the disruption mutants on wheat seedlings was not affected. The results indicate that MgMfs1 is a true multidrug transporter that can function as a determinant of pathogen sensitivity and resistance to fungal toxins and fungicides."

"17123809","abstracttext","Fusarium pseudograminearum causes crown rot of wheat in Australia and most other wheat growing regions, but its evolutionary history is largely unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that F. pseudograminearum is a single phylogenetic species without consistent lineage development across genes. Isolates of F. pseudograminearum, F. graminearum sensu lato, and F. cerealis, were collected from four countries and four single copy, nuclear genes were partially sequenced, aligned with previously published sequences of these and related species, and analysed by maximum parsimony and Bayesian inference. Evolutionary divergence varied between genes, with high phylogenetic incongruence occurring between the gene genealogies. The absence of geographic differentiation between isolates indicates that the introduction of new fungal strains to a region has the potential to introduce new pathogenic and toxigenic genes into the native population through sexual recombination."

"17294254","abstracttext","The purolindolines are small cysteine-rich proteins which are present in the grain of wheat. They have a major impact on the utilisation of the grain as they are the major determinants of grain texture, which affects both milling and baking properties. Bread and durum wheats were transformed with constructs comprising the promoter regions of the Puroindoline a (Pina) and Puroindoline b (Pinb) genes fused to the uidA (GUS) reporter gene. Nine lines showing 3:1 segregation for the transgene and comprising all transgene/species combinations were selected for detailed analysis of transgene expression during grain development. This showed that transgene expression occurred only in the starchy endosperm cells and was not observed in any other seed or vegetative tissues. The location of the puroindoline proteins in these cells was confirmed by tissue printing of developing grain, using a highly specific monoclonal antibody for detection and an antibody to the aleurone-localised 8S globulin as a control. This provides clear evidence that puroindolines are only synthesised and accumulated in the starchy endosperm cells of the wheat grain."

"16906444","abstracttext","To enhance fungal disease resistance, wheat plants (cv. Bobwhite) were engineered to constitutively express the potent antimicrobial protein Ace-AMP1 from Allium cepa, driven by a maize ubiquitin promoter along with its first intron. The bar gene was used for selection of putative transformants on medium containing phosphinothricin (PPT). Transgene inheritance, integration and stability of expression were confirmed over two generations by PCR, Southern, northern and western blot analyses, respectively. The levels of Ace-AMP1 in different transgenic lines correlated with the transcript levels of the transgene. Up to 50% increase in resistance to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici was detected in detached leaf assays. In ears of transgenic wheat inoculated with Neovossia indica, Ace-AMP1 intensified expression of defense-related genes. Elevated levels of salicylic acid and of transcripts of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), glucanase (PR2) and chitinase (PR3) in the transgenic plants indicated manifestation of systemic acquired resistance (SAR)."
"17913618","articletitle","Use of in vitro translation extract depleted in specific initiation factors for the investigation of translational regulation."
"17913618","abstracttext","Regulation of gene expression often involves the control of translation mediated through one or more initiation factors that are required for the translation of eukaryotic mRNAs. Genetic and molecular biological approaches can be highly useful in the initial identification of translational regulation, but the use of in vitro translation lysates can be essential in elucidating the details of translational regulatory mechanisms. Wheat germ lysate has long been used for in vitro translation studies. The noncompetitive conditions that prevail in this lysate as it is normally produced, however, preclude the translational regulatory analysis of many mRNAs involving the preferential recruitment of initiation factors. The development of lysate depleted in specific translation initiation factors converts wheat germ lysate from a noncompetitive system to one that is competitive in a fast and simple procedure that enables it to be used in the analysis of many more translational regulatory mechanisms than is currently possible with unfractionated lysate."

"17561274","abstracttext","Three digoxigenin-labeled cDNA probes complementary to the coat protein (CP) and read-through protein gene sequences of Barley yellow dwarf virus - one each for three species, namely BYDV-GAV, GPV, and PAV - were synthesized for developing a specific and sensitive dot-blot hybridization detection assay for total RNA extracts from field-infected wheat plants. The sensitivity limit for BYDV-GAV, GPV, and PAV probes corresponded to 25microg, 31.25microg, and 62.5microg tissue/spot, respectively. The frequencies for each of the three species determined that BYDV-GAV was the most prevalent in 269 wheat samples collected from 5 agro-ecological areas in China during 2004-2006. The high sensitivity and reliability of the molecular hybridization assay described introduce an important alternative to serological methods for detecting BYDV. This is especially important in less developed countries like China, where appropriate antibodies for BYDV are not available."

"20118181","abstracttext","Sulfate uptake and distribution in plants are managed by the differential expression of a family of transporters, developmentally, spatially, and in response to sulfur nutrition. Elucidation of the signaling pathways involved requires a knowledge of the component parts and their interactions.

The 10 wheat sulfate transporters characterized here are compared to the gene families for both rice and Brachypodium, for whom full genome information is available. Expression is reported in young seedlings with a focus on roles in uptake from nutrient solution and differential expression in relation to sulfate deprivation. In addition, patterns of expression in all organs at the grain filling stage are reported and indicate differential responses to nutritional signals of the individual transporters in specific tissues and an overall coordination of uptake, storage, and remobilization to deliver sulfur to the developing grain."

"23604676","abstracttext","Infection withFusarium graminearum andF. culmorum not only causes severe yield and quality losses, the most relevant concern is the contamination of cereal foods and feeds with trichothecenes (e.g. deoxynivalenol, DON). The ability to synthesize trichothecenes has been shown to be a virulence factor ofF. graminearum on wheat and, on the other hand, toxin resistance is most likely an important component of field resistance. Our hypothesis is that pleiotropic drug resistance mediated by PDR-type ABC transporter proteins (acting as membrane located drug efflux pumps) is a relevant mechanism of DON resistance not only in yeast but also in wheat. Goal of this project is the development of molecular markers for this gene family for use in marker-assisted plant breeding programs. The technical difficulties caused by the large size of the PDR-family are discussed."

Brachypodium distachyon, a diploid wild grass with a sequenced genome and low prolamin content, is the closest relative of the allergen cereals, such as wheat or barley. Using the Brachypodium genome sequence, a workflow has been developed to identify potentially harmful proteins which may cause either celiac disease or wheat allergy-related symptoms. Seed tissue-specific expression of the potential allergens has been determined, and intact epitopes following an in silico digestion with several endopeptidases have been identified. Molecular function of allergen proteins has been evaluated using Gene Ontology terms. Biologically overrepresented proteins and potentially allergen protein families have been identified."

"23212327","abstracttext","This study was carried out to evaluate the genetic effect of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring drought tolerance in wheat. A population of 120 F(2) individuals from the cross between the drought-tolerant S-78-11 and drought-sensitive Tajan cultivars were analyzed for their segregation under drought stress conditions. The relative water content under drought stress conditions exhibited continuous variation, indicating the minor gene effects on the trait. Single-marker analysis (SMA) was carried out to detect the main QTL association with drought tolerance. The SMA results revealed that the simple sequence repeat markers GWM182 and GWM292 on chromosome 5D and GWM410 on chromosome 5A exhibited significant association with drought tolerance, accounting for 30, 22, and 21% of the total variation, respectively. The 3 genetic loci, especially GWM182, can be used in marker-assisted selection methods in drought tolerance breeding in wheat."

"23134352","abstracttext","A novel gene fragment containing a xylanase was identified from a Holstein cattle rumen metagenomic library. The novel xylanase (Xyln-SH1) belonged to the glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10) and exhibited a maximum of 44% identity to the glycoside hydrolase from Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405. Xyln-SH1 was heterologously expressed, purified, and characterized. A high level of activity was obtained under the optimum conditions of pH 6.5 and 40 °C. A substrate utilization study indicated that Xyln-SH1 was cellulase-free and strictly specific to xylan from softwood. The synergistic effects of Xyln-SH1 and feruloyl esterase (FAE-SH1) were observed for the release of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) and ferulic acid (FA) from wheat straw. In addition, a high dose of Xyln-SH1 alone was observed to improve the release of FA from wheat straw. These features suggest that this enzyme has substantial potential to improve biomass degradation and industrial applications."

"24202521","abstracttext","A gene encoding the high-molecular-weight (HMW) subunit of glutenin 1Ax1 was isolated from bread wheat cv Hope. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with that previously reported for an allelic subunit, 1Ax2(*), showed only minor differences, which were consistent with both subunits being associated with good bread-making quality. Quantitative analyses of total protein extracts from 22 cultivars of bread wheat showed that the presence of either subunit 1Ax1 or 1Ax2(*), when compared with a null allele, resulted in an increase in the proportion of HMW subunit protein from ca. 8 to 10% of the total. It is suggested that this quantitative increase in HMW subunit protein may account for the association of 1Ax subunits with good quality."

"24260197","abstracttext","Structural changes of chromosomes are a primary mechanism of genome rearrangement over the course of evolution and detailed knowledge of such changes in a given species and its close relatives should increase the efficiency and precision of chromosome engineering in crop improvement. We have identified sequences bordering each of the main translocation and inversion breakpoints on chromosomes 4A, 5A and 7B of the modern bread wheat genome. The locations of these breakpoints allow, for the first time, a detailed description of the evolutionary origins of these chromosomes at the gene level. Results from this study also demonstrate that, although the strategy of exploiting sorted chromosome arms has dramatically simplified the efforts of wheat genome sequencing, simultaneous analysis of sequences from homoeologous and non-homoeologous chromosomes is essential in understanding the origins of DNA sequences in polyploid species."

"24252927","abstracttext","Intrachromosomal mapping studies were used to locate the positions of the genes Kr1 and Kr2, which control the crossability of wheat with Hordeum bulbosum, on chromosomes 5B and 5A, respectively. The location of Kr1 was established using the telocentric mapping technique and found to be on the long arm of chromosome 5B, distal to the centromere with a mean recombination frequency of 44.8±3.28%. Kr2 was located on the long arm of chromosome 5A by linkage with the major gene markers Vrn1, controlling vernalization requirement, and q, controlling ear morphology. Kr2 is closely linked to Vrn1, with a mean recombination frequency of 4.8±4.66%, and is distal to q with a mean recombination frequency of 38.1±10.60%. The similar locations of Kr1 and Kr2 on homoeologous chromosomes suggest that these two loci are homoeoallelic. Significant correlations between Hordeum bulbosum and rye crossability confirmed that Kr1 and Kr2 control the crossability of wheat with both species."

"24710874","abstracttext","The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to isolate DNA sequences present in the euploid wheat Chinese Spring but not in the Chinese Spring ph1b mutant (which has a deletion of the Ph1 gene, a suppressor of homoeologous chromosome pairing). The polymorphic DNA fragments identified by AFLP were then cloned, sequenced, and used to design two primer pairs. These primers were used in a PCR-based assay to specifically amplify products from the Chinese Spring euploid but not from the ph1b mutant. This PCR assay can be carried out from extracted genomic DNA or directly from alkaline-treated wheat leaves, and the reaction products can be scored on a plus-minus basis, making the screening amenable to automation. The reliability of the assay was tested using a F1-derived doubled-haploid population of 55 lines which segregate for the ph1b deletion. This PCR-screening technique is less time and labour consuming, and more accurate and reliable, than cytologically based conventional methods."

"24913362","abstracttext","Transferring the knowledge bases between related species may assist in enlarging the yield potential of crop plants. Being cereals, rice and wheat share a high level of gene conservation; however, they differ at metabolic levels as a part of the environmental adaptation resulting in different yield capacities. This review focuses on the current understanding of genetic and molecular regulation of yield-associated traits in both crop species, highlights the similarities and differences and presents the putative knowledge gaps. We focus on the traits associated with phenology, photosynthesis, and assimilate partitioning and lodging resistance; the most important drivers of yield potential. Currently, there are large knowledge gaps in the genetic and molecular control of such major biological processes that can be filled in a translational biology approach in transferring genomics and genetics informations between rice and wheat."

"26687461","abstracttext","Fluorescent pseudomonads isolated from wheat leaves were characterized regarding their antagonistic potential and taxonomy in relation to protect crop plants from infestation by Fusarium and Alternaria fungi causing diseases in wheat. Using a dual culture assay, inhibition of fungal growth was found for 40 isolates of 175 fluorescent pseudomonads. Twenty-two of the antagonists were able to suppress strains of Fusarium as well as Alternaria. By means of real-time qPCR, the phlD gene encoding the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol was detected in 20 isolates. On the basis of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry spectral patterns, the isolates with antagonistic activity were assigned to the phylogenetic subgroup Pseudomonas fluorescens and the closely related Pseudomonas gessardii subgroup. The results of the study suggest that pseudomonads in the phyllosphere of crop plants may possibly contribute to natural plant protection."

"26426440","abstracttext","Plant microRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to play critical roles in plant development. In this study, we employed small RNA combined with degradome sequencing to survey development-related miRNAs and their validated targets during wheat grain development. A total of 186 known miRNAs and 37 novel miRNAs were identified in four small RNA libraries. Moreover, a miRNA-like long hairpin locus was first identified to produce 21~22-nt phased siRNAs that act in trans to cleave target mRNAs. A comparison of the miRNAomes revealed that 55 miRNA families were differentially expressed during the grain development. Predicted and validated targets of these development-related miRNAs are involved in different cellular responses and metabolic processes including cell proliferation, auxin signaling, nutrient metabolism and gene expression. This study provides insight into the complex roles of miRNAs and their targets in regulating wheat grain development."

"26607286","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a filamentous fungal pathogen that causes wheat Fusarium head blight. In this study, we identified FgNoxR, a regulatory subunit of NADPH oxidases (Nox) in F. graminearum, and found that it plays an important role in the pathogenicity of F. graminearum. FgNoxR is localized on punctate structures throughout the cytoplasm in aerial hyphae while these structures tend to accumulate at or near the plasma membrane, septa and hyphal tips in germinated conidia. Deletion of the FgNOXR gene results in reduced conidiation and germination. Importantly, sexual development is totally abolished in the FgNOXR deletion mutant. In addition, the disease lesion of FgNOXR deletion mutant is limited to the inoculated spikelets of wheat heads. Finally, FgNoxR interacts with FgRac1 and FgNoxA, and all three proteins are required for female fertility. Taken together, our data indicate that FgNoxR contributes to conidiation, sexual reproduction and pathogenesis in F. graminearum."

In maize and cucumber seedlings, bacterial cells were colonized in epidermal and cortical cells, intercellular spaces and vascular system of root, stem and leaf tissue interiors besides on root surfaces. Higher densities of the bacterial cells in roots, stems and leaves indicated that P. polymyxa WLY78 cells could migrate from roots to stems and leaves of maize and cucumber.

"28934591","abstracttext","Induced mutations have been used to generate novel variation for breeding purposes since the early 1900s. However, the combination of this old technology with the new capabilities of high-throughput sequencing has resulted in powerful reverse genetic approaches in polyploid crops. Sequencing genomes or exomes of large mutant populations can generate extensive databases of mutations for most genes. These mutant collections, together with genome editing, are being used in polyploid species to combine mutations in all copies of a gene (homoeologs), and to expose phenotypic variation that was previously hidden by functional redundancy among homoeologs. This redundancy is more extensive in recently formed polyploids such as wheat, which can now benefit from the deployment of useful recessive mutations previously identified in its diploid relatives. Sequenced mutant populations and genome editing have changed the paradigm of what is possible in functional genetic analysis of wheat."

Recent technological developments in sequencing and assembly methods, however, have largely overcome these barriers. The community now moves to an era centred on functional characterisation of the genome. This includes understanding sequence and structural variation as well as how information is integrated across multiple homoeologous genomes. This understanding promises to uncover variation previously hidden from natural and human selection due to the often observed functional redundancy between homoeologs. Key functional genomic resources will enable this, including sequenced mutant populations and gene editing technologies which are now available in wheat. Training the next-generation of genomics-enabled researchers will be essential to ensure these advances are quickly translated into farmers' fields."

It was recently proposed that the D genome originated from an ancient hybridization between the A and B lineages. However, this result has been questioned, and a robust phylogeny of wheat relatives is still lacking. Using transcriptome data from all diploid species and a new methodological approach, our comprehensive phylogenomic analysis revealed that more than half of the species descend from an ancient hybridization event but with a more complex scenario involving a different parent than previously thought- Aegilops mutica , an overlooked wild species-instead of the B genome. We also detected other extensive gene flow events that could explain long-standing controversies in the classification of wheat relatives."

"30421518","abstracttext","Grain yield is a highly polygenic trait that is influenced by the environment and integrates events throughout the life cycle of a plant. In wheat, the major grain yield components often present compensatory effects among them, which alongside the polyploid nature of wheat, makes their genetic and physiological study challenging. We propose a reductionist and systematic approach as an initial step to understand the gene networks regulating each individual yield component. Here, we focus on grain weight and discuss the importance of examining individual sub-components, not only to help in their genetic dissection, but also to inform our mechanistic understanding of how they interrelate. This knowledge should allow the development of novel combinations, across homoeologs and between complementary modes of action, thereby advancing towards a more integrated strategy for yield improvement. We argue that this will break barriers in terms of phenotypic variation, enhance our understanding of the physiology of yield, and potentially deliver improved on-farm yield."

"30474697","abstracttext","Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) widely exists in organisms, which catalyzes the interconversion of pyruvate into lactate with concomitant interconversion of NADH and NAD + . In this study, two L-type lactate dehydrogenase genes FgLDHL1 and FgLDHL2 were characterized in an ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum, a causal agent of wheat head blight. Both the single-gene deletion mutants of FgLDHL1 or FgLDHL2 exhibited phenotypic defects in vegetative growth, sporulation, spore germination, L-lactate biosynthesis and activity. Additionally, the two L-lactate dehydrogenases were involved in the utilization of carbon sources and maintenance of redox homeostasis during spore germination. Pathogenicity assays showed that ΔFgLDHL1 exhibits reduced virulence on wheat spikelets and on corn stigmas, suggesting that it was indirectly correlated with a reduced level of deoxynivalenol accumulation. These results indicate that FgLDHL1 and FgLDHL2 play multiple roles in the developmental processes and pathogenesis in F. graminearum, and help understand the functional diversity of D-/L-lactate dehydrogenase in phytopathogenic fungi."

"31744172","abstracttext","Although studies have shown the concomitant occurrence of autophagic and programmed cell death (PCD) in plants, the relationship between autophagy and PCD and the factors determining this relationship remain unclear. In this study, seedlings of the wheat cultivar Jimai 22 were used to examine the occurrence of autophagy and PCD during polyethylene glycol (PEG)-8000-induced drought stress. Autophagy and PCD occurred sequentially, with autophagy at a relatively early stage and PCD at a much later stage. These findings suggest that the duration of drought stress determines the occurrence of PCD following autophagy. Furthermore, the addition of 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) and the knockdown of autophagy-related gene 6 (ATG6) accelerated PEG-8000-induced PCD, respectively, suggesting that inhibition of autophagy also results in PCD under drought stress. Overall, these findings confirm that wheat seedlings undergo autophagic survival under mild drought stress, with subsequent PCD only under severe drought."

"26475271","abstracttext_results","The RNA-sequencing was performed using an incompatible wheat cultivar VP1620 and a compatible control cultivar WEN19 infected with H. avenae at 24 h, 3 d and 8 d. Infection assays showed that VP1620 failed to block penetration of H. avenae but disturbed the transition of developmental stages, leading to a significant reduction in cyst formation. Two types of expression profiles were established to predict candidate resistance genes after developing a novel strategy to generate clean RNA-seq data by removing the transcripts of H. avenae within the raw data before assembly. Using the uncoordinated expression profiles with transcript abundance as a standard, 424 candidate resistance genes were identified, including 302 overlapping genes and 122 VP1620-specific genes. Genes with similar expression patterns were further classified according to the scales of changed transcript abundances, and 182 genes were rescued as supplementary candidate resistance genes. Functional characterizations revealed that diverse defense-related pathways were responsible for wheat resistance against H. avenae. Moreover, phospholipase was involved in many defense-related pathways and localized in the connection position. Furthermore, strong bursts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within VP1620 roots infected with H. avenae were induced at 24 h and 3 d, and eight ROS-producing genes were significantly upregulated, including three class III peroxidase and five lipoxygenase genes."

"29441089","articletitle","Identification and Expression Analysis of Wheat TaGF14 Genes."
"29441089","abstracttext","The 14-3-3 gene family members play key roles in various cellular processes. However, little is known about the numbers and roles of 14-3-3 genes in wheat. The aims of this study were to identify TaGF14 numbers in wheat by searching its whole genome through blast, to study the phylogenetic relationships with other plant species and to discuss the functions of TaGF14s . The results showed that common wheat harbored 20 TaGF14 genes, located on wheat chromosome groups 2, 3, 4, and 7. Out of them, eighteen TaGF14s are non-ε proteins, and two wheat TaGF14 genes, TaGF14i and TaGF14f , are ε proteins. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these genes were divided into six clusters: cluster 1 ( TaGF14d, TaGF14g, TaGF14j, TaGF14h, TaGF14c , and TaGF14n ); cluster 2 ( TaGF14k ); cluster 3 ( TaGF14b, TaGF14l, TaGF14m , and TaGF14s ); cluster 4 ( TaGF14a, TaGF14e , and TaGF14r ); cluster 5 ( TaGF14i and TaGF14f ); and cluster 6 ( TaGF14o, TaGF14p, TaGF14q , and TaGF14t ). Tissue-specific gene expressions suggested that all TaGF14s were likely constitutively expressed, except two genes, i.e., TaGF14p and TaGF14f . And the highest amount of TaGF14 transcripts were observed in developing grains at 20 days post anthesis (DPA), especially for TaGF14j and TaGF14l. After drought stress, five genes, i.e., TaGF14c , TaGF14d , TaGF14g , TaGF14h , and TaGF14j , were up-regulated expression under drought stress for both 1 and 6 h, suggesting these genes played vital role in combating against drought stress. However, all the TaGF14s were down-regulated expression under heat stress for both 1 and 6 h, indicating TaGF14s may be negatively associated with heat stress by reducing the expression to combat heat stress or through other pathways. These results suggested that cluster 1, e.g., TaGF14j , may participate in the whole wheat developing stages, e.g., grain-filling (starch biosynthesis) and may also participate in combating against drought stress. Subsequently, a homolog of TaGF14j , TaGF14-JM22 , were cloned by RACE and used to validate its function. Immunoblotting results showed that TaGF14-JM22 protein, closely related to TaGF14d , TaGF14g , and TaGF14j , can interact with AGP-L, SSI, SSII, SBEIIa, and SBEIIb in developing grains, suggesting that TaGF14s located on group 4 may be involved in starch biosynthesis. Therefore, it is possible to develop starch-rich wheat cultivars by modifying TaGF14s ."
"30947257","articletitle","Evolution of Deeper Rooting 1-like homoeologs in wheat entails the C-terminus mutations as well as gain and loss of auxin response elements."
"30947257","abstracttext","Root growth angle (RGA) in response to gravity controlled by auxin is a pertinent target trait for obtainment of higher yield in cereals. But molecular basis of this root architecture trait remain obscure in wheat and barley. We selected four cultivars two each for wheat and barley to unveil the molecular genetic mechanism of Deeper Rooting 1-like gene which controls RGA in rice leading to higher yield under drought imposition. Morphological analyses revealed a deeper and vertically oriented root growth in ""NARC 2009"" variety of wheat than ""Galaxy"" and two other barley cultivars ""Scarlet"" and ""ISR42-8"". Three new homoeologs designated as TaANDRO1-like, TaBNDRO1-like and TaDNDRO1-like corresponding to A, B and D genomes of wheat could be isolated from ""NARC 2009"". Due to frameshift and intronization/exonization events the gene structures of these paralogs exhibit variations in size. DRO1-like genes with five distinct domains prevail in diverse plant phyla from mosses to angiosperms but in lower plants their differentiation from LAZY, NGR and TAC1 (root and shoot angle genes) is enigmatic. Instead of IGT as denominator motif of this family, a new C-terminus motif WxxTD in the V-domain is proposed as family specific motif. The EAR-like motif IVLEM at the C-terminus of the TaADRO1-like and TaDDRO1-like that diverged to KLHTLIPNK in TaBDRO1-like and HvDRO1-like is the hallmark of these proteins. Split-YFP and yeast two hybrid assays complemented the interaction of TaDRO1-like with TOPLESS-a repressor of auxin regulated root promoting genes in plants-through IVLEM/KLHTLIPNK motif. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed abundance of DRO1-like RNA in root tips and spikelets while transcript signals were barely detectable in shoot and leaf tissues. Interestingly, wheat exhibited stronger expression of TaBDRO1-like than barley (HvDRO1-like), but TaBDRO1-like was the least expressing among three paralogs. The underlying cause of this expression divergence seems to be the presence of AuxRE motif TGTCTC and core TGTC with a coupling AuxRE-like motif ATTTTCTT proximal to the transcriptional start site in TaBDRO1-like and HvDRO1-like promoters. This is evident from binding of ARF1 to TGTCTC and TGTC motifs of TaBDRO1-like as revealed by yeast one-hybrid assay. Thus, evolution of DRO1-like wheat homoeologs might incorporate the C-terminus mutations as well as gain and loss of AuxREs and other cis-regulatory elements during expression divergence. Since root architecture is an important target trait for wheat crop improvement, therefore DRO1-like genes have potential applications in plant breeding for enhancement of plant productivity by the use of modern genome editing approaches."

"23379779","abstracttext_background","Phosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and development. To modulate their P homeostasis, plants must balance P uptake, mobilisation, and partitioning to various organs. Despite the worldwide importance of wheat as a cultivated food crop, molecular mechanisms associated with phosphate (Pi) starvation in wheat remain unclear. To elucidate these mechanisms, we used RNA-Seq methods to generate transcriptome profiles of the wheat variety 'Chinese Spring' responding to 10 days of Pi starvation."
"23379779","abstracttext_results","We carried out de novo assembly on 73.8 million high-quality reads generated from RNA-Seq libraries. We then constructed a transcript dataset containing 29,617 non-redundant wheat transcripts, comprising 15,047 contigs and 14,570 non-redundant full-length cDNAs from the TriFLDB database. When compared with barley full-length cDNAs, 10,656 of the 15,047 contigs were unalignable, suggesting that many might be distinct from barley transcripts. The average expression level of the contigs was lower than that of the known cDNAs, implying that these contigs included transcripts that were rarely represented in the full-length cDNA library. Within the non-redundant transcript set, we identified 892-2,833 responsive transcripts in roots and shoots, corresponding on average to 23.4% of the contigs not covered by cDNAs in TriFLDB under Pi starvation. The relative expression level of the wheat IPS1 (Induced by Phosphate Starvation 1) homologue, TaIPS1, was 341-fold higher in roots and 13-fold higher in shoots; this finding was further confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis. A comparative analysis of the wheat- and rice-responsive transcripts for orthologous genes under Pi-starvation revealed commonly upregulated transcripts, most of which appeared to be involved in a general response to Pi starvation, namely, an IPS1-mediated signalling cascade and its downstream functions such as Pi remobilisation, Pi uptake, and changes in Pi metabolism."
"23379779","abstracttext_conclusions","Our transcriptome profiles demonstrated the impact of Pi starvation on global gene expression in wheat.

We examined in more detail a subset of these genes (2,771) where expression was highly influenced by the interaction between these two main factors. Functional assignments using GO annotations showed that genes involved in transport, oxidation-reduction, and stress response were highly represented. Clustering based on the pattern of transcript accumulation identified genes that were up or down-regulated by cold-treatment. Our data indicate that the cold-sensitive lines can up-regulate known cold-responsive genes comparable to that of cold-hardy lines. The levels of expression of these genes were highly influenced by the initial rate and the duration of the gene's response to cold. We show that the Vrn-A1 locus controls the duration of gene expression but not its initial rate of response to cold treatment. Furthermore, we provide evidence that Ta.Vrn-A1 and Ta.Vrt1 originally hypothesized to encode for the same gene showed different patterns of expression and therefore are distinct."

To locate favorable effects of exotic wheat alleles, we developed the tri-parental wheat population SW84. The population was derived from crossing the hexaploid spring wheat cultivars Triso and Devon with one synthetic exotic donor accession, Syn084L, followed by two rounds of backcrossing and three rounds of selfing. SW84 consists of 359 BC2F4 lines, split into two families, D84 (Devon*Syn084L) and T84 (Triso*Syn084L)."
"28686676","abstracttext_studying the genetic control of grain quality in sw84","As a case study, grain quality of SW84 was studied in replicated field trials. Transgressive segregation was observed for all studied grain quality traits by evaluating SW84 for two years at two locations under low and high nitrogen supply. Subsequently, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was carried out based on genomic data derived from a 90k Infinium iSELECT single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. In total, GWAS yielded 37 marker-trait associations, summarized to 16 quantitative trait loci (QTL). These SNPs indicate genetic regulators of grain protein content, grain hardness, sedimentation value and sedimentation ratio. The majority of exotic QTL alleles (75%) exerted favorable effects, increasing grain protein content and sedimentation value in ten and two cases, respectively. For instance, two exotic QTL alleles were associated with a substantial increase of grain protein content and sedimentation value by 1.09% and 7.31 ml, respectively. This finding confirms the potential of exotic germplasm to improve grain quality in cultivated wheat. So far, the molecular nature of most of the detected QTL is unknown. However, two QTL correspond to known genes controlling grain quality: The major QTL on chromosome 6B, increasing grain protein content by 0.70%, on average, co-localizes with the NAM-B1 gene, known to control grain protein content as well as iron and zinc content. Likewise, the major QTL on chromosome 5D, reducing grain hardness by 8.98%, on average, co-localizes with the gene for puroindoline b (Pinb-D1) at the Ha locus. In total, 13 QTL were detected across families, whereas one and three QTL were exclusively detected in families D84 and T84, respectively. Likewise, ten QTL were detected across nitrogen treatments, whereas one and five QTL were exclusively detected under low and high N treatments, respectively. Our data indicate that most effects in SW84 act across families and N levels. Merging of data from two families or two N treatments may, thus, be considered in association studies to increase sample size and, as a result, QTL detection power."

"2392479","abstracttext","Triosephosphate isomerase is an ubiquitous and highly conservative dimeric enzyme, consisting of subunits of Mr 26,000-27,000. Plants usually contain one cytosolic and one plastid isozyme. While 2x wheats also contain one plastid isozyme, 4x wheats contain 3, and 6x cultural wheats contain five plastid isozymes. The multiplicity of the isozyme pattern in 6x wheats is explainable by the presence of three different genomes (AABBDD), each contributing a distinct triosephosphate isomerase gene (alpha',beta,delta), and by the formation of homodimeric and heterodimeric isozyme forms. While the beta beta-form was, as expected, also found in Aegilops speltoides which is regarded as donor of the B genome, the descent of the other genes for plastid triosephosphate isomerase did not occur in accordance with common contentions on the evolution of 6x cultural wheat and its presumptive ancestors. In the reciprocal intergeneric hybrids between wheat and rye, Secalotricum and Triticale, the patterns of both the cytosolic and the plastid-specific triosephosphate isomerases were biparentally inherited, indicating also that the plastid isozyme was nuclear-encoded. Data which are available about amino acid sequences and gene organization and immunological observations show that the cytosolic triosephosphate isomerase of plants is strongly related to other eukaryotic animal triosephosphate isomerase genes. Multiple evidence has been presented that the plastid- specific isozyme represents a distinct polypeptide and is specified by a distinct gene, relative to the cytosolic isozyme. Immunological comparisons indicate that the plastid isozyme shares homologies with the cytosolic isozyme but is not related to the enzyme from prokaryotic cyanobacteria or bacteria. To enable a more precise comparison, plastid triosephosphate isomerase has been cloned from a cDNA library from rye, and cDNA clones are being sequenced. The plastid enzyme of triosephosphate isomerase appears to have evolved from a duplication on an ancestral nuclear gene of the primordial plant cell. For other plastid-specific isozymes evidence exists that their genes were incorporated into the nucleus by gene transfer from a prokaryotic endosymbiont."

"7476855","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to characterize the leaf rust resistance locus Lr1 in wheat. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis was performed on the resistant line Lr1/6* Thatcher and the susceptible varieties Thatcher and Frisal, as well as on the segregating F2 populations. Seventeen out of 37 RFLP probes mapping to group 5 chromosomes showed polymorphism between Lr1/6* Thatcher and Frisal, whereas 11 probes were polymorphic between the near-isogenic lines (NILs) Lr1/6* Thatcher and Thatcher. Three of these probes were linked to the resistance gene in the segregating F2 populations. One probe (pTAG621) showed very tight linkage to Lr1 and mapped to a single-copy region on chromosome 5D. The map location of pTAG621 at the end of the long arm of chromosome 5D was confirmed by the absence of the band in the nulli-tetrasomic line N5DT5B of Chinese Spring and a set of deletion lines of Chinese Spring lacking the distal part of 5DL. Twenty-seven breeding lines containing the Lr1 resistance gene in different genetic backgrounds showed the same band as Lr1/6* Thatcher when hybridized with pTAG621. The RFLP marker was converted to a sequence-tagged-site marker using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. Sequencing of the specific fragment amplified from both NILs revealed point mutations as well as small insertion/deletion events. These were used to design primers that allowed amplification of a specific product only from the resistant line Lr1/6* Thatcher. This STS, specific for the Lr1 resistance gene, will allow efficient selection for the disease resistance gene in wheat breeding programmes. In addition, the identification of a D-genome-specific probe tightly linked to Lr1 should ultimately provide the basis for positional cloning of the gene."

"9065688","abstracttext","The wheat bZIP protein HBP-1a(17) is a putative transcription factor regulating histone gene expression. To delineate the functional domain(s) of this factor, we made a series of effector constructs expressing fusion proteins, in which various portions of HBP-1a(17) are fused to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcriptional activator GAL4, in plant cells. When the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, driven by the wheat histone H3 core promoter harboring the GAL4-binding sequence, was co-transfected with such effector genes into tobacco protoplasts, several portions of HBP-1a(17) influenced reporter gene expression. The N-terminal one-third of HBP-1a(17), termed the P region (residues 1-118) due to its Pro content, did not activate the reporter gene, in contrast to the corresponding Pro-rich region of Arabidopsis GBF1 (residues 1-110), which functions as an activation domain. When the P region was divided into two, however, both its N-terminal (1-56; termed NP) and C-terminal (58-118; termed PC) halves were able to enhance expression of the reporter gene. When the NP region was further divided into NP(5-30) and NP(30-56), both regions still retained activating ability. These results suggest that the P region of HBP-1a(17) is composed of several modules each having activating function, and modification and/or conformational changes of the P region might influence its function."

"12571042","abstracttext","A real-time reverse transcription-PCR system has been used to monitor the expression of an aflatoxin biosynthetic gene of Aspergillus flavus in wheat. Therefore, total RNA was isolated from infected wheat samples, reverse transcribed and subjected to real-time PCR. In parallel all samples were analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography for aflatoxin B(1) production. The primer-probe system of the real-time PCR was targeted against nor-1, a gene of the aflatoxin biosynthetic pathway. By application of this method the nor-1 transcription was quantified during the course of incubation. After 4 days of incubation nor-1 mRNA could be detected for the first time. The amount of nor-1 mRNA increased rapidly, and the maximum was achieved after 6 days. Then, starting very slowly, the mRNA was degraded until day 8, and this was followed by a very fast degradation, reaching nondetectable levels at days 9 and 10. First traces of aflatoxin B(1)could be detected between the 5th and 6th day of incubation. The aflatoxin concentration reached its maximum after 9 days of incubation and remained constant for the whole period of observation. To ensure that differences in the nor-1 mRNA concentration were due to different expression levels, the expression of the constitutively expressed beta-tubulin gene (benA56) has also been monitored. The expression of benA56 remained constant during the whole incubation time. As a parameter for fungal growth, the number of nor-1 gene copies was determined during the course of incubation. The numbers of nor-1 gene copies increased at the beginning of the incubation and reached a plateau at day 5. They correlate well with the viable counts albeit at a higher level."

"14523516","abstracttext","Stripe or yellow rust of wheat, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease in many wheat-growing regions of the world. A number of major genes providing resistance to stripe rust have been used in breeding, including one gene that is present in the differential tester Carstens V. The objective of this study was to locate and map a stripe rust resistance gene transferred from Carstens V to Avocet S and to use molecular tools to locate a number of genes segregating in the cross Savannah/Senat. One of the genes present in Senat was predicted to be a gene that is present in Carstens V. For this latter purpose, stripe rust response data from both seedling and field tests on a doubled haploid population consisting of 77 lines were compared to an available molecular map for the same lines using a non-parametric quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Results obtained in Denmark suggested that a strong component of resistance with the specificity of Carstens V was located in chromosome arm 2AL, and this was consistent with chromosome location work undertaken in Australia. Since this gene segregated independently of Yr1, the only other stripe rust resistance gene known to be located in this chromosome arm, it was designated Yr32. Further QTLs originating from Senat were located in chromosomes 1BL, 4D, and 7DS and from Savannah on 5B, but it was not possible to characterize them as unique resistance genes in any definitive way. Yr32 was detected in several wheats, including the North American differential tester Tres."

"16160821","abstracttext","H32 is a newly identified gene that confers resistance to the highly pervasive Biotype L of the Hessian fly [ Mayetiola destructor (Say)]. The gene was identified in a synthetic amphihexaploid wheat, W-7984, that was constructed from the durum 'Altar 84' and Aegilops tauschii. This synthetic wheat is one of the parents of the marker-rich ITMI population, which consists of 150 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived by single-seed descent from a cross with 'Opata 85'. Linkage analysis of the H32 locus in the ITMI population placed the gene between flanking microsatellite (SSR) markers, Xgwm3 and Xcfd223, at distances of 3.7 and 1.7 cM, respectively, on the long arm of chromosome 3D. The Xgwm3 primers amplified codominant SSR alleles, a 72 bp fragment linked in coupling to the resistance allele and an 84 bp fragment linked in repulsion. Primers for the SSR Xcfd223 amplified a 153 bp fragment from the resistant Synthetic parent and a 183 bp fragment from the susceptible Opata line. Deletion mapping of the flanking Xgwm3 and Xcfd223 markers located them within the 3DL-3 deletion on the distal 19% of the long arm of chromosome 3D. This location is at least 20 cM proximal to the reported 3DL location of H24, a gene that confers resistance to Biotype D of the Hessian fly. Tight linkage of the markers will provide a means of detecting H32 presence in marker-assisted selection and gene pyramiding as an effective strategy for extending durability of deployed resistance."

"16349467","abstracttext","A derivative of Pseudomonas aureofaciens PGS12 expressing a promoterless ice nucleation gene under the control of a phenazine biosynthesis locus was used to study the expression of a phenazine antibiotic locus (Phz) during bacterial seed colonization. Seeds of various plants were inoculated with wild-type PGS12 and a PGS12 ice nucleation-active phz:inaZ marker exchange derivative and planted in soil, and the expression of the reporter gene was monitored at different intervals for 48 h during seed germination. phz gene expression was first detected 12 h after planting, and the expression increased during the next 36-h period. Significant differences in expression of bacterial populations on different seeds were measured at 48 h. The highest expression level was recorded for wheat seeds (one ice nucleus per 4,000 cells), and the lowest expression level was recorded for cotton seeds (one ice nucleus per 12,000,000 cells). These values indicate that a small proportion of bacteria in a seed population expressed phenazine biosynthesis. Reporter gene expression levels and populations on individual seeds in a sample were lognormally distributed. There was greater variability in reporter gene expression than in population size among individual seeds in a sample. Expression on sugar beet and radish seeds was not affected by different inoculum levels or soil matric potentials of -10 and -40 J/kg; only small differences in expression on wheat and sugar beet seeds were detected when the seeds were planted in various soils. It is suggested that the nutrient level in seed exudates is the primary reason for the differences observed among seeds. The lognormal distribution of phenazine expression on seeds and the timing and difference in expression of phenazine biosynthesis on seeds have implications for the potential efficacy of biocontrol microorganisms against plant pathogens."

"19958559","abstracttext_background","TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions IN Genomes) is a powerful tool for reverse genetics, combining traditional chemical mutagenesis with high-throughput PCR-based mutation detection to discover induced mutations that alter protein function. The most popular mutation detection method for TILLING is a mismatch cleavage assay using the endonuclease CelI. For this method, locus-specific PCR is essential. Most wheat genes are present as three similar sequences with high homology in exons and low homology in introns. Locus-specific primers can usually be designed in introns. However, it is sometimes difficult to design locus-specific PCR primers in a conserved region with high homology among the three homoeologous genes, or in a gene lacking introns, or if information on introns is not available. Here we describe a mutation detection method which combines High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis of mixed PCR amplicons containing three homoeologous gene fragments and sequence analysis using Mutation Surveyor software, aimed at simultaneous detection of mutations in three homoeologous genes."
"19958559","abstracttext_results","We demonstrate that High Resolution Melting (HRM) analysis can be used in mutation scans in mixed PCR amplicons containing three homoeologous gene fragments. Combining HRM scanning with sequence analysis using Mutation Surveyor is sensitive enough to detect a single nucleotide mutation in the heterozygous state in a mixed PCR amplicon containing three homoeoloci. The method was tested and validated in an EMS (ethylmethane sulfonate)-treated wheat TILLING population, screening mutations in the carboxyl terminal domain of the Starch Synthase II (SSII) gene. Selected identified mutations of interest can be further analysed by cloning to confirm the mutation and determine the genomic origin of the mutation."
"19958559","abstracttext_conclusion","Polyploidy is common in plants. Conserved regions of a gene often represent functional domains and have high sequence similarity between homoeologous loci.

This method can also be used for SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) marker development and eco-TILLING in polyploid species."

"21113680","abstracttext","Seed development is a complex process controlled by temporal and spatial expression of many transcription factors (TF) inside the developing seed. In the present study, transcript profiles of all the 30 members of rice DofTFs from flowering to seed development stages were analyzed. It was found that 16 Dof genes besides a previously characterized Dof gene 'RPBF' are differentially expressed during the seed development and unlike RPBF are not seed specific. Based on the expression patterns, these rice DofTFs were categorized into four groups-6 genes were constitutive while 4 genes were up-regulated and 3 genes were down regulated and four genes were maximally expressed at specific stages of seed development viz. one gene at flowering, two genes at watery ripe and one gene at milky stage. The involvement of more than one gene at different stages of seed development is suggestive of combinatorial regulation of their downstream genes involved in seed development. In silico expression analysis of wheat and Arabidopsis Dof Tfs also revealed that more than 50% of the Dof genes are expressed during the seed development process. Further in silico study of regulatory elements present in the promoters of these genes revealed the presence of some unique and common motifs in the promoters of rice and wheat Dof genes which indicate that Dof genes are possibly involved in ethylene and jasmonate signaling pathways affecting grain filling and grain quality. These Dof genes containing ethylene responsive motifs in their promoter region could possibly be the targets of recently identified Sub1 gene which codes for a ethylene responsive factor."

"22278178","abstracttext","In the cross of the durable leaf rust resistant wheat Sinvalocho MA and the susceptible line Gama6, four specific genes were identified: the seedling resistance gene Lr3, the adult plant resistance (APR) genes LrSV1 and LrSV2 coming from Sinvalocho MA, and the seedling resistance gene LrG6 coming from Gama6. Lr3 was previously mapped on 6BL in the same cross. LrSV1 was mapped on chromosome 2DS where resistance genes Lr22a and Lr22b have been reported. Results from rust reaction have shown that LrSV1 from Sinvalocho is not the same allele as Lr22b and an allelism test with Lr22a showed that they could be alleles or closely linked genes. LrSV1 was mapped in an 8.5-cM interval delimited by markers gwm296 distal and gwm261 proximal. Adult gene LrSV2 was mapped on chromosome 3BS, cosegregating with gwm533 in a 7.2-cM interval encompassed by markers gwm389 and gwm493, where other disease resistance genes are located, such as seedling gene Lr27 for leaf rust, Sr2 for stem rust, QTL Qfhs.ndsu-3BS for resistance to Fusarium gramineum and wheat powdery mildew resistance. The gene LrG6 was mapped on chromosome 2BL, with the closest marker gwm382 at 0.6 cM. Lines carrying LrSV1, LrSV2 and LrG6 tested under field natural infection conditions, showed low disease infection type and severity, suggesting that this kind of resistance can be explained by additive effects of APR and seedling resistance genes. The identification of new sources of resistance from South American land races and old varieties, supported by modern DNA technology, contributes to sustainability of agriculture through plant breeding."

"23738863","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight, caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a devastating disease of wheat. We developed near-isogenic lines (NILs) differing in the two strongest known F. graminearum resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs), Qfhs.ndsu-3BS (also known as resistance gene Fhb1) and Qfhs.ifa-5A, which are located on the short arm of chromosome 3B and on chromosome 5A, respectively. These NILs showing different levels of resistance were used to identify transcripts that are changed significantly in a QTL-specific manner in response to the pathogen and between mock-inoculated samples. After inoculation with F. graminearum spores, 16 transcripts showed a significantly different response for Fhb1 and 352 for Qfhs.ifa-5A. Notably, we identified a lipid transfer protein which is constitutively at least 50-fold more abundant in plants carrying the resistant allele of Qfhs.ifa-5A. In addition to this candidate gene associated with Qfhs.ifa-5A, we identified a uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glycosyltransferase gene, designated TaUGT12887, exhibiting a positive difference in response to the pathogen in lines harbouring both QTLs relative to lines carrying only the Qfhs.ifa-5A resistance allele, suggesting Fhb1 dependence of this transcript. Yet, this dependence was observed only in the NIL with already higher basal resistance. The complete cDNA of TaUGT12887 was reconstituted from available wheat genomic sequences, and a synthetic recoded gene was expressed in a toxin-sensitive strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This gene conferred deoxynivalenol resistance, albeit much weaker than that observed with the previously characterized barley HvUGT13248."

The variability of the five proteins has been investigated among 38 Hordeum vulgare cultivars and 17 H. spontaneum accessions. Proteins CMa-1, CMc-1 and CMd-1 were invariant within the cultivated species; CMd was also invariant in the wild one. The inheritance of variants CMb-1/CMb-2 and CMe-1/CMe-2,2' was studied in a cross H. spontaneum x H. vulgare. The first two proteins were inherited as codominantly expressed allelic variations of a single mendelian gene. Components CMe-2,2' were jointly inherited and codominantly expressed with respect to CMe-1. Gene CMb and gene(s) CMe were found to be unlinked. The chromosomal locations of genes encoding CM-proteins were investigated using wheat-barley addition lines. Genes CMa and CMc were associated with chromosome 1, and genes CMb and CMd with chromosome 4. These gene locations further support the proposed homoeology of chromosomes 1 and 4 of barley with chromosomes groups 7 and 4 of wheat, respectively. Gene(s) CMe has been assigned to chromosome 3 of barley. The accumulation of protein CMe-1 is totally blocked in the ""high lysine"" mutant Riso 1508 and partially so in the high lysine barley Hiproly."

"27133896","abstracttext","Fungal effector-host sensitivity gene interactions play a key role in determining the outcome of septoria nodorum blotch disease (SNB) caused by Parastagonospora nodorum on wheat. The pathosystem is complex and mediated by interaction of multiple fungal necrotrophic effector-host sensitivity gene systems. Three effector sensitivity gene systems are well characterized in this pathosystem; SnToxA-Tsn1, SnTox1-Snn1 and SnTox3-Snn3. We tested a wheat mapping population that segregated for Snn1 and Snn3 with SN15, an aggressive P. nodorum isolate that produces SnToxA, SnTox1 and SnTox3, to study the inheritance of sensitivity to SnTox1 and SnTox3 and disease susceptibility. Interval quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping showed that the SnTox1-Snn1 interaction was paramount in SNB development on both seedlings and adult plants. No effect of the SnTox3-Snn3 interaction was observed under SN15 infection. The SnTox3-Snn3 interaction was however, detected in a strain of SN15 in which SnTox1 had been deleted (tox1-6). Gene expression analysis indicates increased SnTox3 expression in tox1-6 compared with SN15. This indicates that the failure to detect the SnTox3-Snn3 interaction in SN15 is due - at least in part - to suppressed expression of SnTox3 mediated by SnTox1. Furthermore, infection of the mapping population with a strain deleted in SnToxA, SnTox1 and SnTox3 (toxa13) unmasked a significant SNB QTL on 2DS where the SnTox2 effector sensitivity gene, Snn2, is located. This QTL was not observed in SN15 and tox1-6 infections and thus suggesting that SnToxA and/or SnTox3 were epistatic. Additional QTLs responding to SNB and effectors sensitivity were detected on 2AS1 and 3AL."

"28066494","abstracttext","Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina ( Pt ) is one of the most important diseases of bread wheat globally. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have provided opportunities to analyse the complete transcriptomes of the host as well as pathogen for studying differential gene expression during infection. Pathogen induced differential gene expression was characterized in a near isogenic line carrying leaf rust resistance gene Lr57 and susceptible recipient genotype WL711. RNA samples were collected at five different time points 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h post inoculation (HPI) with Pt 77-5. A total of 3020 transcripts were differentially expressed with 1458 and 2692 transcripts in WL711 and WL711+ Lr57 , respectively. The highest number of differentially expressed transcripts was detected at 12 HPI. Functional categorization using Blast2GO classified the genes into biological processes, molecular function and cellular components. WL711+ Lr57 showed much higher number of differentially expressed nucleotide binding and leucine rich repeat genes and expressed more protein kinases and pathogenesis related proteins such as chitinases, glucanases and other PR proteins as compared to susceptible genotype. Pathway annotation with KEGG categorized genes into 13 major classes with carbohydrate metabolism being the most prominent followed by amino acid, secondary metabolites, and nucleotide metabolism. Gene co-expression network analysis identified four and eight clusters of highly correlated genes in WL711 and WL711+ Lr57 , respectively. Comparative analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts led to the identification of some transcripts which were specifically expressed only in WL711+ Lr57 . It was apparent from the whole transcriptome sequencing that the resistance gene Lr57 directed the expression of different genes involved in building the resistance response in the host to combat invading pathogen. The RNAseq data and differentially expressed transcripts identified in present study is a genomic resource which can be used for further studying the host pathogen interaction for Lr57 and wheat transcriptome in general."

"31333700","abstracttext","The gibberellin (GA)-sensitive dwarfing gene Ddw1 provides an opportunity to genetically reduce plant height in rye. Genetic analysis in a population of recombinant inbred lines confirmed a monogenetic dominant inheritance of Ddw1 . Significant phenotypic differences in PH between homo- and heterozygotic genotypes indicate an incomplete dominance of Ddw1 . De novo transcriptome sequencing of Ddw1 mutant as well as tall genotypes resulted in 113,547 contigs with an average length of 318 bp covering 36.18 Mbp rye DNA. A hierarchical cluster analysis based on individual groups of rye homologs of functionally characterized rice genes controlling morphological or physiological traits including plant height, flowering time, and source activity identified the gene expression profile of stems at the begin of heading to most comprehensively mirror effects of Ddw1 . Genome-wide expression profiling identified 186 transcripts differentially expressed between semi-dwarf and tall genotypes in stems. In total, 29 novel markers have been established and mapped to a 27.2 cM segment in the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 5R. Ddw1 could be mapped within a 0.4 cM interval co-segregating with a marker representing the C20-GA2-oxidase gene ScGA2ox12 , that is up-regulated in stems of Ddw1 genotypes. The increased expression of ScGA2ox12 observed in semi-dwarf rye as well as structural alterations in transcript sequences associated with the ScGA2ox12 gene implicate, that Ddw1 is a dominant gain-of-function mutant. Integration of the target interval in the wheat reference genome sequence indicated perfect micro-colinearity between the Ddw1 locus and a 831 kb segment on chromosome 5A, which resides inside of a 11.21 Mb interval carrying the GA-sensitive dwarfing gene Rht12 in wheat. The potential of Ddw1 as a breeder's option to improve lodging tolerance in rye is discussed."

It activates many genes including high-molecular-weight glutenin and α-amylase gene families. This study presents the first attempt to characterize the rye gene encoding GAMYB in relation to its sequence, polymorphisms, and phenotypic effects."
"32831010","abstracttext_results","ScGAMYB was mapped on rye chromosome 3R using high-density Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT)/DArTseq-based maps developed in three mapping populations.

The average amount of total base raw data was approximately 9 GB. Comparative analysis of the ScGAMYB sequence revealed its high level of homology to wheat and barley orthologues. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) detected among rye inbred lines allowed the development of allele specific-PCR (AS-PCR) markers for ScGAMYB that might be used to detect this gene in wide genetic stocks of rye and triticale. Segregation of the ScGAMYB alleles showed significant relationship with α-amylase activity (AMY)."
"32831010","abstracttext_conclusions","The research showed the strong similarity of rye GAMYB sequence to its orthologues in other Graminae and confirmed the position in the genome consistent with the collinearity rule of cereal genomes. Concurrently, the ScGAMYB coding sequence (cds) showed stronger variability (24 SNPs) compared to the analogous region of wheat (5 SNPs) and barley (7 SNPs). The moderate regulatory effect of ScGAMYB on AMY was confirmed, therefore, ScGAMYB was identified as a candidate gene for partial control of α-amylase production in rye grain. The predicted structural protein change in the aa region 362-372, caused by a single SNP (C/G) at the 1100 position in ScGAMYB cds and single aa sequence change (S/C) at the 367 position, is the likely cause of the differences in the effectiveness of ScGAMYB regulatory function associated with AMY. The development of sequence-based, allele-specific (AS) PCR markers could be useful in research and application."

"1282087","abstracttext","Rice mitochondrial DNA contains an intact copy and a pseudogene copy of a apocytochrome b gene (cob-1 and cob-2, respectively). Using primer extension and capping analyses, the transcriptional start site has been mapped; an 11-base motif at the transcription start site closely matches the consensus promoter motifs proposed for maize, wheat and soybean mitochondrial genes. Although both copies are identical in the 5' upstream region and through most of the coding region, only cob-1-specific mRNA is detected on RNA gel-blots. Run-on transcription analysis indicates, however, that both cob-1 and cob-2 mRNAs are synthesized in vivo but less cob-2 is accumulated. At its mapped 3' terminus the cob-1 transcript possesses a sequence that could fold into a double stem-loop structure. The possible roles of a double stem-loop structure in mitochondrial gene expression are discussed."

The extent of gene expression in the poly rI.rC induced cells was compared to that of the uninduced cells by hybridization of the mRNA to complementary DNA. Homologous template driven hybridization of cDNA revealed the presence of two clearly defined transitions in the total poly A RNA from the induced cells; abundant class and a scarce class comprising approximately 37,000 diverse species of RNA. Heterologus hybridization of the cDNA with total uninduced mRNA showed that the majority of the mRNA sequences are the same in both the induced and uninduced cells. The results of the hybridization using cDNA prepared to the fraction enriched for interferon mRNA, however, showed that about 4% of the sequences present in the interferon enriched fraction are not present in the uninduced cells. These differences may result from the poly rI.rC induced alterations in gene expression."

Fusion of 1.8 kb of promoter sequence upstream from -117 bp to a minimal (-55 CaMV 35S) promoter gave rise to hormone-independent expression implying that the region 3' to -117 bp contains an element which represses transcription in the absence of gibberellin or presence of abscisic acid."

"2431897","abstracttext","Two plant introns along with flanking exon sequences have been isolated from an amylase gene of wheat and a legumin gene of pea and cloned behind the phage SP6 promoter. Pre-mRNAs produced by in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase were tested for their ability to be spliced in a HeLa cell nuclear extract. The plant introns were accurately spliced and the predicted splice junctions were used. Lariat RNAs were observed as both intermediates and final products during the splicing reaction. The branch points were mapped to adenosine residues lying within sequences that showed good homology to the animal branch point consensus. Consensus sequences for the 5' and 3' splice junctions and for putative branch point sequences of plants were derived from an analysis of 168 plant intron sequences."
"2875379","articletitle","The tobacco mitochondrial ATPase subunit 9 gene is closely linked to an open reading frame for a ribosomal protein."
"2875379","abstracttext","A transcribed segment of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) from Nicotiana tabacum contains the F0-ATPase subunit 9 gene, an open reading frame with homology to the E. coli small subunit ribosomal protein S13 and an open reading frame with homology to a portion of the mammalian ""URF 1"" protein, recently shown to be a component of the NADH:ubiquinone reductase complex (NADH:Q 1). The transcriptional patterns of the tobacco ATPase 9 gene and S13-like open reading frame share eight RNA species indicating the two sequences are part of the same transcriptional unit. A maize mtDNA fragment contains the S13 homologous sequence and the NADH:Q 1 homologous sequence in an orientation similar to tobacco. The S13-like sequence is present as a single copy in maize and tobacco, as two copies in wheat, and is absent in pea and bean. We discuss the distribution and orientation of the S13-like and ""URF 1""-like sequences and the possibility that they are active genes."
"3839304","articletitle","Conservation and variability of wheat alpha/beta-gliadin genes."
"3839304","abstracttext","We have sequenced two genomic clones for wheat alpha/beta-gliadin storage protein genes. Comparison with a known sequence reveals close homology between the three and confirms the previously suspected evolutionary relatedness of members of this gliadin family. The coding region can be divided into six domains. Two unusual structures were found within this region: (i) The P-boxes which are composed of 12 codons, six of which are for proline, that are tandemly repeated four or five times; and (ii) Two polyglutamine stretches which consist of 18-22 tandemly repeated glutamine codons in one case, and 7-28 in the second. Analysis of the P-box structures revealed that certain mutations were probably present in the hypothetical ancestral alpha/beta-gliadin gene prior to gene multiplication. None of the genes have introns. All of the genes appear to contain typical eukaryotic promoters and also possess the double polyadenylation signal of plants."
"3888625","articletitle","Primer-independent abortive initiation by wheat-germ RNA polymerase B (II)."
"3888625","abstracttext","Highly purified RNA polymerase B (II) from wheat germ catalyses the formation of dinucleoside tetraphosphates from ribonucleoside triphosphates in the absence of an oligonucleotide primer or additional protein factors. The reaction requires bivalent cations such as Mn2+ or Mg2+ and proceeds linearly for several hours. It is strongly inhibited by 1 microgram/ml alpha-amanitin or 2 micrograms/ml heparin. The reaction strictly depends on the addition of a specific linear or circular DNA template, such as the plasmid pSmaF or a DNA fragment containing the gene for nopaline dehydrogenase. Bacteriophage T7 D111 DNA has almost no template activity. The start sites for dinucleotide synthesis on the template are limited. With the DNA fragment containing the gene for nopaline dehydrogenase only pppApA and pppApU are synthesised substantially whereas pppUpU is formed only in trace amounts. No significant dinucleotide synthesis is observed with other ribonucleoside triphosphates either singly or in a combination of two. The various regions of the DNA fragment differ distinctly in template activity."
"3737408","articletitle","Preferential homogenization between adjacent and alternate subrepeats in wheat rDNA."
"3737408","abstracttext","DNA from the ""non-transcribed spacer"" (NTS) of two wheat ribosomal RNA gene (rDNA) clones was sequenced. The regions flanking the internal subrepeat arrays are highly conserved between the two clones; the nucleotide sequence differ by less than one-half percent. In contrast, the consensus sequences of the subrepeats in the two arrays differ by three percent. Mutations unique to each array, yet found in more than one subrepeat of the array, are preferentially found in adjacent and alternate subrepeats. The similarity of the DNA sequences of the flanking regions is consistent with a model of homogenization among rDNA gene units by intergenic conversion. We propose that a different mechanism, preferential conversion between neighboring subrepeats, is largely responsible for the homogenization of subrepeats within an array."

"1869573","abstracttext","Ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), which participate in the post-translational conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins, are encoded by a multigene family in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. E2s function in a variety of cellular activities including intracellular proteolysis, DNA repair, sporulation, and cell cycle traverse. Here, we report the cloning and characterization of a new member of the yeast UBC gene family, UBC8. UBC8 encodes a 206-amino acid protein containing a highly acidic carboxyl terminus. The primary structure of the protein is similar to that of all other known E2s, with the highest homology being to the E2 (23 kDa) of wheat germ. Haploid strains in which the UBC8 gene is disrupted are viable, and the disruption does not produce any obvious phenotype. The UBC8 protein, produced in Escherichia coli, forms thiol ester adducts with ubiquitin and, apparently, diubiquitin, but does not transfer ubiquitin to histones."

"7232211","abstracttext","RNA 3 of alfalfa mosaic virus (AlMV) contains information for two genes: near the 5' end an active gene coding for a 35 Kd protein and, near the 3' end, a silent gene coding for viral coat protein. We have determined a sequence of 318 nucleotides which contains the potential initiation codon for the 35 Kd protein at 258 nucleotides from the 5' end. This long leader sequence can form initiation complexes containing three 80 S ribosomes. A shorter species of RNA, corresponding to a molecule of RNA 3 lacking the cap and the first 154 nucleotides (RNA 3') has been isolated. The remaining leader sequence of 104 nucleotides in RNA 3' forms a single 80 S initiation complex with wheat germ ribosomes. The location of the regions of the leader sequence of RNA 3 involved in initiation complex formation with 80 S ribosomes is reported."
"2982496","articletitle","Insertion mutagenesis to increase secondary structure within the 5' noncoding region of a eukaryotic mRNA reduces translational efficiency."
"2982496","abstracttext","The thymidine kinase gene of herpes simplex virus 1 was mutated by inserting oligodeoxynucleotide linkers into the region of the gene corresponding to the 5' untranslated portion of the mRNA. These linkers, when transcribed into mRNA, might be expected to form hairpin loops and hence to increase the secondary structure of the 5' end of the mRNA. Thymidine kinase insertion derivatives were examined in vivo and in vitro to determine translational efficiency. For the in vivo studies, thymidine kinase insertion derivatives were transfected into thymidine kinase deficient L cells alone and together with a selectable dominant marker, or were assayed in the COS-1 transient expression system. For in vitro studies, thymidine kinase insertion derivatives were subcloned into pSP64. Capped transcripts were analyzed for their ability to bind ribosomes and translate in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and wheat-germ extracts. The results demonstrate that translation efficiency is decreased as the number of linkers is increased and support the view that excessive secondary structure at the 5' end of eukaryotic mRNA impedes translation."
"7910142","articletitle","Differential expression of a gene encoding an acidic dehydrin in chilling sensitive and freezing tolerant gramineae species."
"7910142","abstracttext","We have characterized a new wheat cold-regulated cDNA clone, Wcor410, that accumulates to equivalent levels in root, crown and leaf tissues during cold acclimation. The Wcor410 cDNA contains an ORF encoding a dehydrin-like glutamate-rich protein of 28 kDa with a pI of 5.1. However, the acidic nature, the absence of the glycine-rich repeat and of the conserved N-terminal region, DEYGNP, suggest that Wcor410 belongs to a different subgroup of the D11 protein family. Northern analysis showed that this gene is expressed only in freezing tolerant gramineae, whereas Southern analysis showed that the Wcor410 gene is present in all monocot species tested. The presence of freezing tolerance-associated genes in sensitive species such as rice and corn is interesting. Characterization of the regulatory factors controlling these genes may help to establish an appropriate strategy to improve freezing tolerance."

"7710357","abstracttext","The RNA2 nucleotide sequence of a mechanically transmitted isolate of barley mild mosaic virus (BaMMV) has been determined. A combination of Northern blot and sequence analysis indicates that this RNA2 lacks approximately 1000 nucleotides of its C-terminal protein (P2) gene, with respect to Polymyxa graminis transmitted BaMMV. This is confirmed by sequence comparison with RNA2 of a fungus transmitted BaMMV isolate, which reveals the presence of a single deletion located in the 3'-terminal part of the P2 gene. As a consequence, this RNA2 codes for a P2 protein of only 34 K. Sequence homology between the bymovirus P2 protein and the capsid readthrough protein of beet necrotic yellow vein virus and soil-borne wheat mosaic virus suggests an evolutionary relationship between bymo- and furoviruses."
"8587105","articletitle","Seed storage proteins of spermatophytes share a common ancestor with desiccation proteins of fungi."
"8587105","abstracttext","The legumin- and vicilin-like seed storage globulins of spermatophytes are specifically accumulated during embryogenesis and seed development. Previous studies have shown that a precursor common to both legumin and vicilin genes might have evolved by duplication from a single-domain ancestral gene. We here report that amino acid sequences of legumin and vicilin domains share statistically significant similarity to the germination-specific germins of wheat as well as to the spherulation-specific spherulins of myxomycetes. This conclusion is further supported by the derived intron-exon structure of a spherulin gene. Spherulins are thought to be involved in tissue desiccation or hydration. It is suggested that the present-day seed globulins of spermatophytes have evolved from a group of ancient proteins functional in cellular desiccation/hydration processes."

"8207094","abstracttext","A 41,000 M(r) polypeptide of Chlorella exhibits a circadian rhythm in its synthesis and possesses characteristic features of a putative essential clock protein as was proposed by the coupled translation-membrane model. Purification of this polypeptide and a microsequencing analysis yielded a N-terminal sequence of 35 amino acids that showed no homology to known sequences that were thought to be involved in circadian rhythm such as the per gene of Drosophila and the frq gene of Neurospora. However, strong homology was observed to 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) of different organisms. The highest homology (83%) of this Chlorella sequence was found with the PGK of wheat chloroplast. PGK activity and the 41,000 M(r) polypeptide co-purified through differential centrifugation and gel filtration. These data, and comparison with the physical properties of other known PGK molecules, support the conclusion that the 41,000 M(r) polypeptide of Chlorella, a candidate for a putative essential clock protein, is 3-phosphoglycerate kinase."

"7859305","abstracttext","An enzyme with a particular 1,4-beta-xylanase activity was identified and purified from wheat-bran culture medium of an Aspergillus awamori strain. With oligonucleotides based on the N-terminal amino-acid sequence of the enzyme, the exlA gene of A. awamori, encoding 1,4-beta-xylanase A, has been cloned. Based on the deduced amino-acid sequence, 1,4-beta-xylanase A is produced as a 211 amino-acid-residue-long precursor, which is converted post-translationally into a 184-aa residue-long mature protein. Transformation of the original A. awamori strain with multiple copies of the exlA gene resulted in a 40-fold overproduction of 1,4-beta-xylanase A. The overproduced enzyme has the same biochemical and enzymological properties as the wild-type enzyme."

"8639739","abstracttext","Sequence analysis of the two cDNA clones 47/11 and 50A which were isolated by differential screening of an explant cDNA library obtained from the monocot Tritordeum (hexaploid hybrid of diploid wild barley and tetraploid wheat lines) reveals that both clones include the same open reading frame (ORF). The sequence of this ORF shows a high degree of similarity with dicot S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (SAMDC) gene sequences and contains regions highly conserved in all known SAMDC sequences. It is further shown that the sequence represented by the cDNA clones 47/11 and 50A is derived from the wild barley (Hordeum chilense) genome, where it is present as a single-copy gene. Northern analyses indicate the corresponding transcript to accumulate in response to wounding and the transcript level changes with a circadian rhythm, having a beak in the middle of the light period. The periodicity continues in constant light, but is changed in constant darkness."

"8973527","abstracttext","Complementary DNAs encompassing the coat protein coding and adjacent regions of Agropyron mosaic virus (AgMV) and Hordeum mosaic virus (HoMV) were cloned and sequenced.

Nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons of the 3'-terminal regions of these and other rymoviruses indicate that distinct groups exist. Ryegrass mosaic virus (RGMV) strains share sequence similarity with AgMV and HoMV. Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) and brome streak mosaic virus (BrSMV) form a separate group, sharing limited sequence similarity with the other rymoviruses. It is proposed that subgroups occur within the Rymovirus genus, depending on the vector species involved in transmission and on sequences."

"9260972","abstracttext","Pseudomonas putida, a bacterium that colonizes plant roots and enhances plant growth, produces three isozymes of catalase (A, B, and C) in stationary-phase cells. A catalase probe, generated by PCR analysis of P. putida genomic DNA with oligomers based on typical catalase sequences, hybridized to a genomic clone that expressed catalase C in Escherichia coli. The catC gene from this clone had a 2,133-bp open reading frame with a high level of identity to the stationary-phase-specific E. coli katE. Chromosomal mutants of P. putida deficient in catalase C, obtained by gene interruption with a luxAB-npt cassette, demonstrated enhanced catC transcription in stationary-phase cells and, upon exposure to phenol, in logarithmic-phase cells. The catalase C-deficient cells were not impaired in their ability to colonize roots of bean or wheat plants grown under sterile conditions."
"10383962","articletitle","Interaction of Azospirillum lipoferum with wheat germ agglutinin stimulates nitrogen fixation."
"10383962","abstracttext","In vitro, the nitrogen fixation capability of A. lipoferum is efficiently increased in the presence of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). A putative WGA-binding receptor, a 32-kDa protein, was detected in the cell capsule. The stimulatory effect required N-acetyl-D-glucosamine dimer (GlcNAcdi) terminated sugar side chains of the receptor and was dependent on the number of GlcNAcdi links involved in receptor-WGA interface. Binding to the primary sugar binding sites on WGA had a larger stimulatory effect than binding to the secondary sites. The WGA-receptor complex generated stimulus led to elevated transcription of the nifH and nifA genes and of the glnBA gene cluster but not of the glnA gene from its own promoter. There may well be a signalling cascade contributing to the regulation of nitrogen fixation."
"9784118","articletitle","Plant comparative genetics after 10 years."
"9784118","abstracttext","The past 10 years have seen the discovery of unexpected levels of conservation of gene content and gene orders over millions of years of evolution within grasses, crucifers, legumes, some trees, and Solanaceae crops. Within the grasses, which include the three 500-million-ton-plus-per-year crops (wheat, maize, and rice), and the crucifers, which include all the Brassica crops, colinearity looks good enough to do most map-based cloning only in the small genome model species, rice and Arabidopsis. Elsewhere, knowledge gained in a few major crops is being pooled and applied across the board. The extrapolation of information from the well-studied species to orphan crops, which include many tropical species, is providing a solid base for their improvement. Genome rearrangements are giving new insights into evolution. In fact, comparative genetics is the key that will unlock the secrets of crop plants with genomes larger than that of humans."

"9570125","abstracttext","We describe the isolation and sequence of a gene encoding 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) (EC 1.13.11.27)) from the wheat leaf-spot fungal pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola (Septoria tritici), that directs the synthesis of 2,5-dihydroxyphenylacetate (homogentisic acid, HGA). The sequence of the deduced peptide showed homology to HPPDs from other organisms; the greatest identity was to a T-cell reactive protein, also identified as HPPD, from the human fungal pathogen Coccidioides immitis. As observed for HPPD from other sources, expression of the M. graminicola HPPD gene in Escherichia coli cells could be detected by the gradual development of a brown pigment in cultures as a result of the spontaneous oxidation and polymerisation of HGA. Pigment development in these cultures was prevented by the HPPD inhibitor sulcotrione."
"10212939","articletitle","Evolution and origins of tobamoviruses."
"10212939","abstracttext","More than a dozen tobamoviruses are known. In nature, each species probably survives by moving between several closely related host species. Each infected plant contains a population of variants, but in most host populations the tobamovirus population is stable. The phylogenetic relationships of tobamovirus species broadly correlate with those of their angiosperm hosts. The simplest explanation for this correlation is that they have coevolved with the angiosperms, and hence, like them, are about 120-140 million years old. Gene sequence differences between species also indicate that the tobamoviruses are an ancient genus. Their gene sequences, and the protein motifs they encode, link them to tobraviruses, hordeiviruses and soil-borne wheat mosaic virus, more distantly to the tricornaviruses, and even to hepatitis virus E and other furoviruses, rubiviruses and alphaviruses. Their progenitors may have been associated with charophycean algae, and perhaps also plasmodiophoromycete fungi."
"11387986","articletitle","Rice--the pivotal genome in cereal comparative genetics."
"11387986","abstracttext","Over the past 15 years rice has been the focus of intense co-ordinated research activity to apply the new molecular biology to this key staple. The fact that rice has a small tractable genome and the development of genetic and genomic tools not available in any other cereal have now ensured the promotion of rice as a favoured research target. However the discovery that gene content and gene order--genome colinearity--have been maintained among all the Poaceae family for some 60 million years of evolution has elevated rice yet further to the status of a 'model' organism. Rice tools can be applied in research on the other major cereals, wheat and maize, and many aspects of rice genetics can be transferred to the many minor economic grass species that have not themselves warranted extensive research and breeding. In this paper we describe some of the applications of the discovery of extensive synteny among the grasses."
"11432729","articletitle","Caenorhabditis elegans expresses a functional phytochelatin synthase."
"11432729","abstracttext","The formation of phytochelatins, small metal-binding glutathione-derived peptides, is one of the well-studied responses of plants to toxic metal exposure. Phytochelatins have also been detected in some fungi and some marine diatoms. Genes encoding phytochelatin synthases (PCS) have recently been cloned from Arabidopsis, wheat and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Surprisingly, database searches revealed the presence of a homologous gene in the Caenorhabditis elegans genome, DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no. 266513. Here we show that C. elegans indeed expresses a gene coding for a functional phytochelatin synthase. CePCS complements the Cd2+ sensitivity of a Schizosaccharomyces pombe PCS knock-out strain and confers phytochelatin synthase activity to these cells. Thus, phytochelatins may play a role for metal homeostasis also in certain animals."
"10471928","articletitle","Nuclear targeting peptide scaffolds for lipofection of nondividing mammalian cells."
"10471928","abstracttext","Lipofection of nondividing cells is inefficient because much of the transfected DNA is retained in endosomes, and that which escapes to the cytoplasm enters the nucleus at low rates. To improve the final rate-limiting step of nuclear import, we conjugated a nonclassical nuclear localization signal (NLS) containing the M9 sequence of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) A1, to a cationic peptide scaffold derived from a scrambled sequence of the SV40 T-antigen consensus NLS (ScT). The ScT was added to improve DNA binding of the M9 sequence. Lipofection of confluent endothelium with plasmid complexed with the M9-ScT conjugate resulted in 83% transfection and a 63-fold increase in marker gene expression. The M9-ScT conjugate localized fluorescent plasmid into the nucleus of permeabilized cells, and addition of the nuclear pore blocker wheat germ agglutinin prevented nuclear import. This method of gene transfer may lead to viral- and lipid-free transfection of nondividing cells."

"10713441","abstracttext","This paper reports isolation and properties of a rice gene, OsGAI, a putative homolog of the GAI of Arabidopsis thaliana. OsGAI encodes a polypeptide of 625 amino acids, which shows 53-55% identity to GAI and RGA from A. thaliana, and 85% identity to wheat rht-D1a and maize d8. Genomic DNA blot analysis indicated the OsGAI to be a single-copy gene in the rice genome. RNA blot hybridization showed that OsGAI transcripts increased within 6h upon GA(3) but not ABA application. This GA-induced increment in OsGAI transcripts did not require de novo protein synthesis. High levels of OsGAI transcripts were detected in nodes, internodes, leaf sheaths and ears of adult plants and leaf sheaths of young seedlings, where GA enhances cell elongation and division. Transiently expressed OsGAI-GFP fusion protein located to the nucleus in onion epidermal cells. Transactivation assays clearly indicated that OsGAI protein is a transcriptional activator or a coactivator."

"10778389","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequence of mitochondrial ribosomal protein rps13 gene from wild perennial grass Elymus sibiricus is presented. It was determined by the method of PCR amplification with specific oligonucleotide primers and the direct sequencing of the amplification product. The sequence of E. sibiricus mitochondrial gene for S13 predicts a hydrophobic ribosomal protein of 116 amino acids that shows strong similarity to those of wheat (99.7% identity) and maize (98%). The deduced amino acid sequence of S13 protein from E. sibiricus and homologous plant's (Zea mays, Daucus carota, Nicotiana tabacum, Marchantia polymorpha) and nonplant's (Escherichia coli) proteins shows the presence of hydrophobic amino acids' motif -L-X10-L-X10-M-X10-L-X10-L-. Slightly modified it can be found in many other ribosomal proteins. This conserved motif is presumed to be particularly important for association of the ribosomal S13 protein with other proteins in the small subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome."

Transformation constructs were introduced into uredospores of Pgt, an obligate pathogen of wheat, by biolistic bombardment. Uredospores transformed with the construct containing the hpt gene germinated and initiated branching on selective medium, indicating that they had acquired resistance to hygromycin B. However, transformants stopped growing 5 days after bombardment. GUS activity in uredospores and germlings was histochemically detected 4-16 h after bombardment. GUS expression was also obtained using the INF24 promoter from the bean rust fungus Uromyces appendiculatus, demonstrating that heterologous genes can be expressed in P. graminis under the control of regulatory sequences from closely related organisms."

A great many of the functions of ingested proteins, their peptide fragments, and amino acids have been characterized and some have been brought to practical application. Using a GeneChip DNA microarray system, we first compared the gene expression profiles among rats fed on 12% casein, 12% gluten, and protein-free diets for one week. The results revealed that a few hundred genes in the liver and muscle were up- or down-regulated by more than two-fold after feeding of the gluten or the protein-free diet. Interesting findings included the induction of genes for synthesis and catabolism of cholesterol by gluten feeding. In addition, we performed a study to examine the effect of the consumption of an enzymatically produced, hypoallergenic wheat flour on gene expression profiles in rats. The results confirmed the safety of this novel food product."

"15479228","abstracttext","The cloning of two novel genes that encode cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) in barley is described in this work. Transformation of both genes into Arabidopsis and tobacco showed that at least one of the genes codes for a functional enzyme, as its expression caused a cytokinin-deficient phenotype in the heterologous host plants. Additional cloning of two gene fragments, and an in silico search in the public expressed sequence tag clone databases, revealed the presence of at least 13 more members of the CKX gene family in barley and wheat. The expression of three selected barley genes was analyzed by RT-PCR and found to be organ-specific with peak expression in mature kernels. One barley CKX (HvCKX2) was characterized in detail after heterologous expression in tobacco. Interestingly, this enzyme shows a pH optimum at 4.5 and a preference for cytokinin ribosides as substrates, which may indicate its vacuolar targeting. Different substrate specificities, and the pH profiles of cytokinin-degrading enzymes extracted from different barley tissues, are also presented."

It consists of 141,182 base-pairs (bp), containing a pair of inverted repeat regions (IR(A), IR(B)) of 22,794 bp each. The IR(A) and IR(B) sequences separate a small single copy region (12,546 bp) and a large single copy (83,048 bp) region. The gene content and relative arrangement of the 116 identified genes (82 peptide-encoding genes, four ribosomal RNA genes, 30 tRNA genes), with the 16 ycf genes, are highly similar to maize. Editing events, defined as C-to-U transitions in the mRNA sequences, were comparable with those observed in maize, rice and wheat. The conservation of gene organization and mRNA editing suggests a common ancestor for the sugarcane and maize plastomes. These data provide the basis for functional analysis of plastid genes and plastid metabolism within the Poaceae. The sugarcane chloroplast DNA sequence is available at GenBank under accession NC005878."

"12152322","abstracttext","Components of resistance conferred by the Lr46 gene, reported as causing ""slow rusting"" resistance to leaf rust in wheat, were studied and compared with the effects of Lr34 and genes for quantitative resistance in cv. Akabozu. Lr34 is a gene that confers non-hypersensitive type of resistance. The effect of Lr46 resembles that of Lr34 and other wheats reported with partial resistance. At macroscopic level, Lr46 produced a longer latency period than observed on the susceptible recurrent parent Lalbahadur, and a reduction of the infection frequency not associated with hypersensitivity. Microscopically, Lr46 increased the percentage of early aborted infection units not associated with host cell necrosis and decreased the colony size. The effect of Lr46 is comparable to that of Lr34 in adult plant stage, but in seedling stage its effect is weaker than that of Lr34."

"12362381","abstracttext","Direct matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) analysis of a mixture of tryptic peptides was used to verify the gene-derived amino acid sequence of the high molecular weight (HMW) subunit 1Dx2 of bread wheat. Analysis of the digest was performed by recording several MALDI mass spectra of the mixture at low, medium and high mass ranges, and optimising the matrix and the acquisition parameters for each mass range. This resulted in coverage of the whole sequence except for a short fragment T3 (3 amino acids), which was not detected. It also allowed the insertion of a Pro residue in position 59 to be identified. The results obtained provide evidence for the lack of a substantial level of glycosylation or other post-translational modifications of subunit 1Dx2, and demonstrate that MALDI-MS is the most useful method presently available for the direct verification of the gene-derived sequences of HMW glutenin subunits and similar proteins."
"12582688","articletitle","The sugar beet mitochondrial nad4 gene: an intron loss and its phylogenetic implication in the Caryophyllales."
"12582688","abstracttext","The sugar beet mitochondrial gene for subunit IV of NADH dehydrogenase ( nad4) has been characterized. Unlike the corresponding genes in wheat and turnip, sugar beet nad4 lacks the second intron ( nad4-i2). Northern-blot analysis demonstrates transcription of the gene. A total of 19 RNA editing sites were identified in the sugar beet nad4 transcripts; interestingly, there is no editing in the region which flanks the lost intron. This observation is in favour of intron loss via homologous recombination of an edited RNA intermediate. We also found that the nad4-i2 intron is absent from the mitochondrial genomes of all examined members of the Caryophyllales, but present in the closely related orders, Polygonales and Plumbaginales, which suggests that the intron was lost in the common ancestor of the Caryophyllales."

"15774659","abstracttext","Twenty morphologically different strains were chosen from French wheat sourdough isolates. Cells were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile rods. The isolates were identified using amplified-fragment length polymorphism, randomly amplified polymorphic DNA and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. All isolates were members of the genus Lactobacillus. They were identified as representing Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus spicheri and Lactobacillus sakei. However, two isolates (LP38(T) and LP39) could be clearly discriminated from recognized Lactobacillus species on the basis of genotyping methods. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and DNA-DNA relatedness data indicate that the two strains belong to a novel Lactobacillus species, for which the name Lactobacillus hammesii is proposed. The type strain is LP38(T) (=DSM 16381(T)=CIP 108387(T)=TMW 1.1236(T))."

Phylogenetic analyses using the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain clearly indicated that the strain belonged to the family Enterobacteriaceae, most closely related to Enterobacter cloacae with 99.0% and Enterobacter dissolvens with 98.5% sequence similarity. Phylogenetic analysis derived from the sequence of the rpoB gene showed the highest sequence similarities to Enterobacter cowanii (93.0%) but supported the distinct position of strain D5/23T. The isolate produced a fatty acid pattern typical for members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. On the basis of the phylogenetic analyses, DNA-DNA hybridizations, and the unique physiological and biochemical characteristics, we propose that strain D5/23T represents a new species of the genus Enterobacter for which we propose the name Enterobacter radicincitans sp. nov."

"14551762","abstracttext","Previous studies have shown that heterosis is associated with differential gene expression between hybrids and their parents. In this study, we performed a screen for genes that are differentially expressed between wheat hybrids and their parents in jointing-stage leaves and flag leaves using the differential display technique. Twenty-four differentially expressed cDNA were cloned and sequenced, and their expression patterns were confirmed by reverse-Northern blotting. Sequence analysis and database searches revealed that among the genes that showed differential expression between hybrid and parents were transcription factor genes and genes involved in metabolism, signal transduction, disease resistance, and retrotransposons. These results indicate that hybridization between two parental lines can cause changes in the expression of a variety of genes, and it is concluded that the altered pattern of gene expression in the hybrid may be responsible for the observed heterosis."

R.Br.) derived from a half-sib progeny of the Early Gene Pool (EGP 261) and used in a male-sterile line, ICMA 90111, was compared with other known cms sources for RFLP of mitochondrial (mt) DNA. Southern blot hybridization of mtDNA from ICMA 90111 digested with several restriction enzymes and probed with homologous mtDNA clones from pearl millet and heterologous gene clones from maize and wheat revealed the RFLP patterns of ICMA 90111 distinct from others studied so far. The dendrogram of male-sterile lines constructed from the Southern blot hybridization patterns indicated that ICMA 90111 represents a separate group. Our results suggest that this source of cms is unique in several respects."

"18470166","abstracttext","Gene action for adult-plant resistance to powdery mildew was studied using generation mean analyses of parents and of F1, F2, and backcross populations derived from a diallel cross of one susceptible and three adult-plant resistant wheat cultivars. Joint scaling tests showed that an additive-dominance model was sufficient to explain the variability in the expression of adult-plant resistance in one cross, while digenic epistasis was involved in the other five crosses. Additive gene effects were predominant; however, dominance was significant in four crosses, additive x additive interaction was significant in three crosses, additive x dominance interaction was significant in three crosses, and dominance x dominance interaction was significant in one cross. Therefore, selection for adult-plant resistance would likely be most effective in advanced generations derived from crosses among the adult-plant resistant cultivars Redcoat, Houser, and Massey."

"15063743","abstracttext","In land plant mitochondria, c-type cytochromes are assembled via a mechanism similar to that found in Gram-negative bacteria and different from that used by mitochondria from other eukaryotes. The wheat mitochondrial genome encodes CCM (for cytochrome c maturation) proteins, among them CcmF(C), a protein similar to the C-terminal part of the bacterial CcmF. The gene is transcribed into a 1.7 kb transcript at steady state. However, the 3' termini of the transcript were found to occur upstream of the deduced gene termination codon. This discrepancy was solved by RNA editing that introduces a novel termination codon, thus shortening the reading frame by 27 codons. The processed transcript is translated into a protein integrated in the mitochondrial inner membrane. We also show that the protein is part of a large (700 kDa) protein complex, that possibly represents a cytochrome c assembly complex."

In order to produce pre-S2 antigen in Aspergillus oryzae, the gene [pre-S2]3, which encodes a tandemly triplicated repeat of pre-S2 polypeptides was fused with the partial glaA gene encoding glucoamylase lacking the starch-binding domain. In submerged culture, A. oryzae transformants carrying glaA-[pre-S2]3 secreted a heterogeneously glycosylated form of the fusion protein that was partially degraded. Contrarily, utilization of a wheat brain solid-state culture system resulted in the secretion of a homogeneous glycosylated form of the whole fusion protein. This is the first report of a dissimilarity in glycosylated modification between submerged and solid-state culture conditions in heterologous protein production in A. oryzae."

"19062129","abstracttext","Very long chain primary alcohols are significant components in cuticle waxes of plants. Fatty acyl-CoA reductases (FARs) catalyze the formation of a fatty alcohol from an acyl-CoA. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genome contains eight genes homologous to FAR genes from jojoba (Simmondsia chinensis), silk moth, wheat and mouse. Expression of six Arabidopsis FAR homologs in Escherichia coli resulted in production of alcohols from endogenous E. coli fatty acids by five of these genes, confirming that they encode for FAR enzymes. Only a truncated splicing version of the sixth gene was found, and this gene yielded a protein with no FAR activity. The five functional FAR enzymes yielded distinctly different compositions of fatty alcohols when expressed in E. coli, indicating that the different enzymes may be involved in the production of different types of alcohols in plant cells."

"17379549","abstracttext","The ABC transporter-encoding gene MgAtr7 from the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola was cloned based upon its high homology to ABC transporters involved in azole-fungicide sensitivity. Genomic and cDNA sequences indicated that the N-terminus of this ABC transporter contains a motif characteristic for a dityrosine/pyoverdine biosynthesis protein. This makes MgAtr7 the first member of a new class of fungal ABC transporters harboring both a transporter and a biosynthetic moiety. A homologue of MgAtr7 containing the same biosynthetic moiety was only found in the Fusarium graminearum genome and not in any other fungal genome examined so far. The gene structure of both orthologous transporters is highly conserved and the genomic area surrounding the ABC transporter exhibits micro-synteny between M. graminicola and F. graminearum. Functional analyses revealed that MgAtr7 is neither required for virulence nor involved in fungicide sensitivity but indicated a role in maintenance of iron homeostasis."
"17770329","articletitle","Gene transfer in cereals."
"17770329","abstracttext","Until recently, gene transfer in plants was achieved only by sexual hybridization. Now, in addition, plant genetic manipulation, with the use of both recombinant DNA and protoplast fusion technology, is being applied to an increasing range of plants. The soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, with its associated plasmid, is used as a vector for introducing DNA into the genomes of dicotyledonous plants, but it has not proved suitable for cereals. Instead, the direct uptake of plasmid DNA into cereal protoplasts is being used for the transformation of cells in rice, wheat, and maize. Transformation efficiencies, in some cases, are becoming comparable to those obtained in dicotyledons with Agrobacterium. In rice it is now possible to regenerate efficiently whole plants from protoplasts, and this capability may soon be extended to the other cereals. By means of direct interaction of cereal protoplasts with plasmids, coupled with improved procedures for the regeneration of plants from their protoplasts, gene transfer in the cereals is becoming established at the frontiers of recombinant DNA technology."

The resistant callus pieces that develop are then transferred onto medium with the selective agent and reduced plant growth regulators for plant regeneration and further selection. It takes approximately 2.5 to 3 mo from inoculation to the establishment of R0 plants in soil. All the transformants should be morphologically normal and set seeds. Approximately 35% of the transgenic plants have a single copy of the transgene based on data obtained from previous experiments."

An endo-beta-1,4-glucanase (ThEG) was purified from the culture filtrate, and the gene and the cDNA were isolated. The gene consisted of an open reading frame encoding 384 amino acids, interrupted by 11 introns. The whole sequence showed high homology with that of family 5 glycoside hydrolase. The properties of the recombinant enzyme (rEG) in Aspergillus oryzae were compared with those of the En-1 from Irpex lacteus, which showed the highest homology among all the endoglucanases reported. The rEG activity against Avicel was about 8 times higher than that of En-1 when based on CMC degradation. A remarkable structural difference between the two enzymes was the length of the linker connecting the cellulose-binding domain to the catalytic domain."

EB was found in 5' upstream region of many seed storage protein genes accounting for these genes expression exclusive in endosperm among various cereals. Many reports demonstrated that the bZIP transcription activators isolated from wheat, barley and maize, etc. regulate the gene expression through binding to the GCN4 motif. In this research, we showed that GCN4 sequence could be recognized by nuclear proteins extracted from immature rice seeds. Furthermore, a rice bZIP protein, REB was isolated by using PCR method and REB fusion protein was expressed in E. coli. The results of gel shift analysis showed that REB could recognize and bind to the GCN4 motif in the Wx gene in addition to binding to the target sequence in the promoter of alpha-globulin."

"18618297","abstracttext","The synthetic cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) gene, modified according to the optimized codon usage of plant genes, was introduced into a plant expression vector and expressed under the control of the Bx17 HMW (high molecular weight) wheat endosperm-specific promoter containing an intron of the rice act1. The recombinant vector was transformed into rice plants using a biolistic-mediated transformation method. Stable integration of the synthetic CTB gene into the chromosomal DNA was confirmed by PCR amplification analysis. A high level of CTB (2.1% of total soluble protein) was expressed in the endosperm tissue of the transgenic rice plants. The synthetic CTB produced only in the rice endosperm demonstrated strong affinity for G(M1)-ganglioside, thereby suggesting that the CTB subunits formed an active pentamer. The successful expression of CTB genes in transgenic plants makes it a powerful tool for the development of a plant-derived edible vaccine."

"19932112","abstracttext","Culture medium supplemented with wheat germ oil (WGO) causes physiological reactions, such as increased fecundity and mobility, in some insects. Although the impact of WGO on insect physiology is important, the mechanisms of these actions are poorly understood. In this paper, we test the hypothesis that the addition of WGO to medium developed for larval oriental fruit flies modulates gene expression in the corresponding adults. We separately reared larvae of Bactrocera dorsalis on diets lacking or supplemented with WGO, and analyzed for expressed proteins in the resulting adult males and females by 2D-electrophoresis. Analysis of the gels revealed significant changes in expression levels of >70 proteins, 64 of which were identified by mass spectrometric analysis on MALDI-TOF/TOF. Apparent changes in expression levels for 6 of these proteins were confirmed by quantitative real-time PCR, showing that the changes in mRNA expression were reflected in changes in protein expression. These findings support the hypothesis that one mechanism of WGO actions in insect nutrition is the modulation of gene expression."

"22026998","abstracttext","Sclerotinia sclerotiorum fungus has three endoxylanases induced by wheat bran. In the first part, a partial xylanase sequence gene (90 bp) was isolated by PCR corresponding to catalytic domains (β 5 and β 6 strands of this protein). The high homology of this sequence with xylanase of Botryotinia fuckeliana has permitted in the second part to amplify the XYN1 gene. Sequence analysis of DNA and cDNA revealed an ORF of 746 bp interrupted by a 65 bp intron, thus encoding a predicted protein of 226 amino acids. The mature enzyme (20.06 kDa), is coded by 188 amino acid (pI 9.26). XYN1 belongs to G/11 glycosyl hydrolases family with a conserved catalytic domain containing E(86) and E(178) residues. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that there was no Asn-X-Ser/Thr motif required for N-linked glycosylation in the deduced sequence however, five O-glycosylation sites could intervene in the different folding of xylanses isoforms and in their secretary pathway."

The P0 protein of WYDV-GPV (P0(GPV)) and the P6 protein of BYDV-GAV (P6(GAV)) displayed RSS activities when expressed in agro-infiltrated leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana, by their local ability to inhibit post-transcriptional gene silencing of GFP. Analysis of GFP, mRNA and GFP-specific small interfering RNA indicated that both P0(GPV) and P6(GAV) are suppressors of silencing that can restrain not only local but also systemic gene silencing. This is the first report of RSS activity of the P6 protein in a member of the genus Luteovirus."

The hydrolysis products of birchwood xylan and corncob xylan were predominantly xylobiose (76.9 and 90.8%, respectively) and no xylose. These characteristics suggest that XYNBM4 has potential in various applications, especially in the food industry."

"21633895","abstracttext","Plants have evolved diverse mechanism to recognize pathogen attack and triggers defense responses. These defense responses alter host cellular function regulated by endogenous, small, non-coding miRNAs. To understand the mechanism of miRNAs regulated cellular functions during stem rust infection in wheat, we investigated eight different miRNAs viz. miR159, miR164, miR167, miR171, miR444, miR408, miR1129 and miR1138, involved in three different independent cellular defense response to infection. The investigation reveals that at the initiation of disease, accumulation of miRNAs might be playing a key role in hypersensitive response (HR) from host, which diminishes at the maturation stage. This suggests a possible host-fungal synergistic relation leading to susceptibility. Differential expression of these miRNAs in presence and absence of R gene provides a probable explanation of miRNA regulated R gene mediated independent pathways."

"22260775","abstracttext","A strategy for rationally constructing a novel type of eukaryotic OFF-riboswitch, which ligand-dependently turns off translation mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), has been established. The theophylline-dependent IRES-based OFF-riboswitch obtained through the proposed strategy functioned well in wheat germ extract, independently from the downstream gene, indicating that it can regulate any gene. Despite the fact that it has one theophylline aptamer, its switching efficiency was as high as that of a previously reported theophylline-dependent OFF-riboswitch that was constructed by inserting three continuous theophylline aptamers into a 5' untranslated region in mRNA to downregulate the normal 5'-terminus-mediated translation. In addition, because the riboswitch part that was optimized in the theophylline-dependent IRES-based OFF-riboswitch, except for the aptamer domain, can be used as-is for other aptamer-ligand pairs, an arbitrary ligand-dependent IRES-based OFF-riboswitch is easy to construct with the corresponding well-minimized aptamer."

"23125431","abstracttext","Cereal grass pulvini have emerged as model systems that are not only valuable for the study of gravitropism, but are also of agricultural and economic significance. The pulvini are regions of tissue that are apical to each node and collectively return a reoriented stem to a more vertical position. They have proven to be useful for the study of gravisensing and response and are also providing clues about the establishment of polarity across tissues. This review will first highlight the agronomic significance of these stem regions and their benefits for use as model systems and provide a brief historical overview. A detailed discussion of the literature focusing on cell signaling and early changes in gene expression will follow, culminating in a temporal framework outlining events in the signaling and early growth phases of gravitropism in this tissue. Changes in cell wall composition and gene expression that occur well into the growth phase will be touched upon briefly. Finally, some ongoing research involving both maize and wheat pulvini will be introduced along with prospects for future investigations."

"23096921","abstracttext","Brachypodium distachyon has been proposed as a new model for the temperate grass because it is related to the major cereal grain species (such as wheat, barley, oat, maize, rice, and sorghum) and many forage and turf species. In this study, a multivariate statistical analysis was performed to investigate the characteristics of codon bias and the main factors affecting synonymous codon usage in Brachypodium. We found that low- and high-GC content genes with different codon usage occur frequently in the genome. The results of neutrality, correspondence, and correlation analyses indicated that mutational pressure and selective constraint were the main factors in shaping codon usage. Coding sequence length and the hydrophobicity of each protein were also identified as influences on codon usage bias, although their effect was minor. In addition, 27 codons, defined as ""optimal codons"", might provide useful information for gene engineering, gene prediction, and molecular evolution studies."

The deduced amino acid sequence revealed a high identity (93%) to a Hd1-like protein from wheat. The identified mutation allowed the localisation of ScHd1 on a genetic map of rye (6RS). A small, statistically significant linkage between ScHd1 and earliness per se (eps) and some morphological traits was also established. The chromosomal region, including the S76 allele for the ScHd1 gene was linked to earlier heading, elongated spikes, a greater number of spikelets per spike and an increased weight of 1000 kernels."

The copy number of the transgenes varied from one to five in the different lines. One line was unstable, first losing expression of and then eliminating both the transgenes in R3 plants. Although the gus gene was detected in all the lines, GUS expression had been lost in R2 plants of all but one line. Rearrangement of transgene sequences was observed, but it had no effect on gene expression. All the stable lines were found to segregate for transgene activity in a Mendelian fashion."
"24203034","articletitle","Effect of gene Lr34 in the enhancement of resistance to leaf rust of wheat."
"24203034","abstracttext","Leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 is present in many wheat cultivars throughout the world that have shown durable resistance to leaf rust. Fourteen pair-wise combinations of Lr34 and seedling leaf rust resistance genes were developed by intercrossing near isogenic 'Thatcher' lines. In both seedling and adult plant tests homozygous paired combinations of specific resistance genes with Lr34 had enhanced resistance relative to either parent to different numbers of isolates that were avirulent to the additional resistance genes. The TcLr34, 18 line also expressed enhanced resistance to specific isolates virulent to Lr18 in seedling and adult plant stages. In rust nursery tests, homozygous lines were more resistant than either parent, if the additional leaf rust gene conditioned an effective of resistance when present singly. The ability of Lr34 to interact with other genes conditioning effective resistance may contribute to the durability of leaf rust resistance in cultivars with Lr34."

"24310936","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast genes for the alpha, beta and epsilon subunits of wheat chloroplast ATP synthase have been determined. Open reading frames of 1512 bp, 1494 bp and 411 bp are deduced to code for polypeptides of molecular weights 55201, 53796 and 15200, identified as the alpha, beta and epsilon subunits respectively by homology with the subunits from other sources and by amino acid sequencing of the epsilon subunit. The genes for the beta and epsilon subunits overlap by 4 bp. The gene for methionine tRNA is located 118 bp downstream from the epsilon subunit gene. Comparisons of the deduced amino acid sequences of the alpha and beta subunits with those from other species suggest regions of the proteins involved in adenine nucleotide binding."
"24263337","articletitle","The use of irradiated pollen for differential gene transfer in wheat (Triticum aestivum)."
"24263337","abstracttext","The use of irradiated pollen to bring about limited gene transfer in wheat has been investigated. Doses of X-rays of 2Kr, 3Kr and 5Kr were used to generate M1 progeny between maternal and paternal genotypes differing in quantitative and major gene characters. Cytological studies of M1 plants revealed hybrids with widespread aneuploidy and structural rearrangements in the paternal genome. These effects resulted in phenotypic variation between M1 progeny and complex multivalent formation at meiosis. All M1 plants at the 5Kr and 3Kr doses were sterile and all but 2 plants at the 2Kr dose.Studies of the two M2 families from these plants revealed disturbances in genotype frequencies for some of the marker loci with an excess of maternal homozygotes and a deficit of paternal homozygotes. This was also reflected in a more maternal appearance for quantitative characters. These results are interpreted as showing that irradiation damage to the paternal genome in M1 plants results in the differential transmission of maternal alleles."

"24226457","abstracttext","Dwarf varieties have had virtually no impact on the production of pearl millet, in contrast to the case of wheat, rice, and sorghum. This research compared tall and dwarf near-isogenic F1 hybrids to attempt to determine if there were deleterious effects of the d 2 dwarfing gene that might account for the lack of release/cultivation of dwarf pearl millet cultivars. Dwarf isohybrids on average yielded less than the tails, because of a smaller average seed size combined with a similar grain number per unit area. There was, however, a larger contribution of background genetic variation (pollinator, male-sterile, and interaction effects) to hybrid variation for nearly all characters measured, including seed size, than there was of the dwarfing gene. Selection of dwarf parents capable of producing hybrids with equal seed size and yield to that of tall parents should not be difficult."

"24866851","abstracttext","Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) is a DNA virus belonging to the genus Mastrevirus of the family Geminiviridae. In this study, we report that the Rep protein encoded by WDV is a RNA silencing supressor as determined by co-infiltration assays using transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana line 16c carrying the GFP reporter gene. The Rep protein was shown to inhibit both local and systemic RNA silencing of the GFP gene as well as the spread of systemic GFP RNA silencing signals. Gel mobility shift assays showed that the Rep protein binds 21 nt and 24 nt small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes and single-stranded (ss)-siRNA. To our knowledge, this is the first identification of an RNA silencing suppressor encoded by mastreviruses. Furthermore, deletion mutagenesis indicates that both the N- and C-terminal regions of the Rep protein are not critical for silencing suppression and self-interaction, but the N terminus of Rep is necessary for its pathogenicity."

"26272349","abstracttext","The feruloyl esterase (FAE) gene EST1 from the basidiomycete Pleurotus sapidus was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris. Catalytically active recombinant Est1 was secreted using P. pastoris as a host. For expression in P. pastoris, the expression vector pPIC9K was applied. The EST1 gene was cloned with an N-terminal α-mating factor pre-pro sequence and expressed under the control of a methanol inducible alcohol oxidase 1 promotor. Est1 was purified to homogeneity using ion exchange and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The recombinant Est1 showed optima at pH 5.0 and 50 °C, and released ferulic acid from saccharide esters and from the natural substrate destarched wheat bran. Substrate specificity profile and descriptor-based analysis demonstrated unique properties, showing that Est1 did not fit into the current FAE classification model. Transferuloylation synthesis of feruloyl-saccharide esters was proven for mono- and disaccharides."

"25486242","abstracttext","Bread wheat producing grain in which the pericarp is purple is considered to be a useful source of dietary anthocyanins. The trait is under the control of the Pp-1 homoealleles (mapping to each of the group 7 chromosomes) and Pp3 (on chromosome 2A). Here, TaMyc1 was identified as a likely candidate for Pp3. The gene encodes a MYC-like transcription factor. In genotypes carrying the dominant Pp3 allele, TaMyc1 was strongly transcribed in the pericarp and, although at a lower level, also in the coleoptile, culm and leaf. The gene was located to chromosome 2A. Three further copies were identified, one mapping to the same chromosome arm as TaMyc1 and the other two mapping to the two other group 2 chromosomes; however none of these extra copies were transcribed in the pericarp. Analysis of the effect of the presence of combinations of Pp3 and Pp-1 genotype on the transcription behavior of TaMyc1 showed that the dominant allele Pp-D1 suppressed the transcription of TaMyc1."

In this paper, we report 22 entry constructs as new molecular tools based on the Gateway technology facilitating rapid construction of binary vectors that can be used for functional analysis of genes in fungi. The entry vectors for single, double or triple gene-deletion mutants were developed using hygromycin, geneticin and nourseothricin resistance genes as selection markers. Furthermore, entry vectors containing green fluorescent (GFP) or red fluorescent (RFP) in combination with hygromycin, geneticin or nourseothricin selection markers were generated. The latter vectors provide the possibility of gene deletion and simultaneous labelling of the fungal transformants with GFP or RFP reporter genes. The applicability of a number of entry vectors was validated in Zymoseptoria tritici, an important fungal wheat pathogen."
"26721744","articletitle","Proteomic patterns associated with heterosis."
"26721744","abstracttext","Heterosis is characterized by higher seed yields, plant biomass or other traits in heterozygotes or hybrids compared with their genetically divergent parents, which are often homozygous. Despite extensive investigation of heterosis and its wide application in crops such as maize, rice, wheat and sorghum, its molecular basis is still enigmatic. In the past century, some pioneers have proposed multigene models referring to the complementation of allelic and gene expression variation, which is likely to be an important contributor to heterosis. In addition, there are potential interactions of epigenetic variation involved in heterosis via novel mechanisms. At the level of gene expression, many recent studies have revealed that the heterosis phenomenon can be deciphered not only at the transcriptional level but also at the proteomic level. This review presents an update on the information supporting the involvement of proteomic patterns in heterosis and a possible future direction of the field.

"28802024","articletitle","The cereal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum produces a new class of active cytokinins during infection."
"28802024","abstracttext","The fungal pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum causes important diseases of wheat and barley. During a survey of secondary metabolites produced by this fungus, a novel class of cytokinins, herein termed Fusarium cytokinins, was discovered. Cytokinins are known for their growth-promoting and anti-senescence activities, and the production of a cytokinin mimic by what was once considered as a necrotrophic pathogen that promotes cell death and senescence challenges the simple view that this pathogen invades its hosts by employing a barrage of lytic enzymes and toxins. Through genome mining, a gene cluster in the F. pseudograminearum genome for the production of Fusarium cytokinins was identified and the biosynthetic pathway was established using gene knockouts. The Fusarium cytokinins could activate plant cytokinin signalling, demonstrating their genuine hormone mimicry. In planta analysis of the transcriptional response to one Fusarium cytokinin suggests extensive reprogramming of the host environment by these molecules, possibly through crosstalk with defence hormone signalling pathways."

"31142748","abstracttext","In allopolyploids, correct chromosome segregation requires suppression of non-homologous crossovers while levels of homologous crossovers are ensured. To date, no mechanism able to specifically inhibit non-homologous crossovers has been described in allopolyploids other than in bread wheat. Here, we show that reducing the number of functional copies of MSH4, an essential gene for the main crossover pathway, prevents non-homologous crossovers in allotetraploid Brassica napus. We show that non-homologous crossovers originate almost exclusively from the MSH4-dependent recombination pathway and that their numbers decrease when MSH4 returns to single copy in B. napus; by contrast, homologous crossovers remain unaffected by MSH4 duplicate loss. We also demonstrate that MSH4 systematically returns to single copy following numerous independent polyploidy events, a pattern that is probably not by chance. These results suggest that stabilization of allopolyploid meiosis can be enhanced by loss of a key meiotic recombination gene."

Here, the global transcriptome of four aneuploid derivatives of a synthetic hexaploid wheat line was acquired, with the goal of characterizing the relationship between gene copy number and transcript abundance."
"32131739","abstracttext_results","For most of the genes mapped to the chromosome involved in aneuploidy, the abundance of transcripts reflected the gene copy number. Aneuploidy had a greater effect on the strength of transcription of genes mapped to the chromosome present in a noneuploid dose than on that of genes mapped elsewhere in the genome. Overall, changing the copy number of one member of a homeologous set had little effect on the abundance of transcripts generated from the set of homeologs as a whole, consistent with the tolerance of aneuploidy exhibited by allopolyploids, whether in the form of a chromosomal deficit (monosomy) or chromosomal excess (trisomy)."

"32277457","abstracttext","The following protocol describes the genetic transformation of wheat using the BioRad PDS/1000-He particle delivery system. Immature embryos are isolated 12-16 days post-anthesis, the embryonic axis is removed, and the immature scutella are precultured for 1-2 days prior to particle bombardment. Gold particles are coated with plasmid DNA containing the gene(s) of interest plus a selectable marker gene, in this instance bar (bialaphos resistance), and are fired into the cells to deliver the DNA. Subsequent tissue culture and regeneration steps allow recovery of plantlets, assisted by the inclusion of PPT (phosphinothricin tripeptide), the active ingredient of glufosinate-ammonium containing herbicides, to help select transformants. This updated method introduces selection earlier in the regeneration process which provides a shortened protocol while maintaining high transformation efficiencies."

"32559926","abstracttext","It is very important to reduce methane production and emission during aerobic composting. In this study, the effects of covering with a semi-permeable membrane during pig manure and wheat straw composting were investigated. Two laboratory-scale composting reactors were used: the membrane covered treatment (treatment A) and the control treatment (treatment B). Composting in treatment A effectively improved the oxygen utilization rate and decreased methane emissions by 22.42% relative to the control treatment. Quantification of functional genes and Pearson rank correlations showed that the mcrA and mcrA/pmoA gene abundances were significantly positively correlated with temperature and negatively correlated with the interstitial oxygen concentration, and that the pmoA gene abundance was positively correlated with the carbon: nitrogen ratio and moisture content. Therefore, increasing the aeration rate and optimizing the carbon: nitrogen ratio and moisture content will decrease methane emissions. Together, the results demonstrate that coverage membrane could be a novel strategy for reducing methane emissions during composting."

We demonstrated cytologically that patterns of 3C t -induced chromosomal fragmentation in microspores differed from patterns observed for other Gc genes. Uninuclear microspores of the monosomic 3C t addition line had high frequencies of micronuclei, possibly explaining its low fertility. Chromosome fragmentation was observed in prometaphase and metaphase of the first pollen mitosis in the monosomic 3C t addition line. Patterns of chromosome fragmentation were different from those previously reported for Gc chromosomes 2S of Aegilops speltoides, 4S sh of Ae. sharonensis and 2C cy of Ae. cylindrica; many chromosome fragments were observed in prometaphase of the first pollen mitosis in the monosomic 3C t addition plants.

The F 2 plants, which segregated for target-site point mutations of PDS gene (Leu498 and Glu425) grown in monoculture and under competition with wheat in pot-trials and evaluated for growth and fecundity. All F 2 individuals were genotyped by using Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sequence (CAPS) technique. Regression analysis showed no fitness cost in the resistant plants because no significant difference was identified in seed and biomass production within RR, RS and SS individuals. The absence of measurable negative effects on fitness associated mutations suggests that the frequency of the PDS resistance alleles will not decline in the absence of selection pressure of PDS-inhibitors."

"31110131","abstracttext","An invasive fungal pathogen has reduced the American chestnut ( Castanea dentata ), once a keystone tree species within its natural range in the eastern United States and Canada, to functional extinction. To help restore this important canopy tree, blight-tolerant American chestnut trees have been developed using an oxalate oxidase-encoding gene from wheat. This enzyme breaks down oxalate, which is produced by the pathogen and forms killing cankers. Expressing oxalate oxidase results in blight tolerance, where the tree and the fungus can coexist, which is a more evolutionarily stable relationship than direct pathogen resistance. Genetic engineering (GE) typically makes a very small change in the tree's genome, potentially avoiding incompatible gene interactions that have been detected in some chestnut hybrids. The GE American chestnut also retains all the wild American chestnut's alleles for habitat adaptation, which are important for a forest ecosystem restoration program."

"32658634","abstracttext","Chinese wheat landrace Youbailan has excellent resistance to powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici . In the present study, genetic analysis indicated that a recessive gene, tentatively designated pmYBL , was responsible for the powdery mildew resistance of Youbailan. pmYBL was located in the 695-to-715-Mb genomic region of chromosome 7BL, with 19 gene-linked single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. It was flanked by SNP1-12 and SNP1-2 with genetic distances of 0.6 and 1.8 centimorgans, respectively. The disease reaction patterns of Youbailan and four cultivars (lines) carrying the powdery mildew ( Pm ) genes located on chromosome arm 7BL indicated that pmYBL may be allelic or closely linked to these genes. All of the SNP markers linked to pmYBL were diagnostic, indicating that these markers will be useful for pyramiding pmYBL using marker-assisted selection."

"14767678","abstracttext","Comparative RFLP mapping has revealed extensive conservation of marker order in different grass genomes. However, microcolinearity studies at the sequence level have shown rapid genome evolution and many exceptions to colinearity. Most of these studies have focused on a limited size of genomic fragment and the extent of microcolinearity over large distances or across entire genomes remains poorly characterized in grasses. Here, we have investigated the microcolinearity between the rice genome and a total of 1,500 kb from physical BAC contigs on wheat chromosome 1AS. Using ESTs mapped in wheat chromosome bins as an additional source of physical data, we have identified 27 conserved orthologous sequences between wheat chromosome 1AS and a region of 1,210 kb located on rice chromosome 5S. Our results extend the orthology described earlier between wheat chromosome group 1S and rice chromosome 5S. Microcolinearity was found to be frequently disrupted by rearrangements which must have occurred after the divergence of wheat and rice. At the Lr10 orthologous loci, microrearrangements were due to the insertion of mobile elements, but also originated from gene movement, amplification, deletion and inversion. These mechanisms of genome evolution are at the origin of the mosaic conservation observed between the orthologous regions. Finally, in silico mapping of wheat genes identified an intragenomic colinearity between fragments from rice chromosome 1L and 5S, suggesting an ancestral segmental duplication in rice."

"16624516","abstracttext","Bread wheat chromosome 3A has been shown to contain genes/QTLs controlling grain yield and other agronomic traits. The objectives of this study were to generate high-density physical and genetic-linkage maps of wheat homoeologous group 3 chromosomes and reveal the physical locations of genes/QTLs controlling yield and its component traits, as well as agronomic traits, to obtain a precise estimate of recombination for the corresponding regions and to enrich the QTL-containing regions with markers. Physical mapping was accomplished by 179 DNA markers mostly representing expressed genes using 41 single-break deletion lines. Polymorphism survey of cultivars Cheyenne (CNN) and Wichita (WI), and a substitution line of CNN carrying chromosome 3A from WI [CNN(WI3A)], with 142 RFLP probes and 55 SSR markers revealed that the extent of polymorphism is different among various group 3 chromosomal regions as well as among the homoeologs. A genetic-linkage map for chromosome 3A was developed by mapping 17 QTLs for seven agronomic traits relative to 26 RFLP and 15 SSR chromosome 3A-specific markers on 95 single-chromosome recombinant inbred lines. Comparison of the physical maps with the 3A genetic-linkage map localized the QTLs to gene-containing regions and accounted for only about 36% of the chromosome. Two chromosomal regions containing 9 of the 17 QTLs encompassed less than 10% of chromosome 3A but accounted for almost all of the arm recombination. To identify rice chromosomal regions corresponding to the particular QTL-containing wheat regions, 650 physically mapped wheat group 3 sequences were compared with rice genomic sequences. At an E value of E < or = 10(-5), 82% of the wheat group 3 sequences identified rice homologs, of which 54% were on rice chromosome 1. The rice chromosome 1 region collinear with the two wheat regions that contained 9 QTLs was about 6.5 Mb."

"16921499","abstracttext","Maternal diet during pregnancy has been proposed to modify female offspring's later susceptibility to develop breast cancer; however, most of the dietary factors identified thus far have led to increased risk. To identify dietary factors that might reduce offspring's breast cancer risk, pregnant rat dams were fed diets containing 6% fiber originating either from cellulose (control), or oat, whole wheat or defatted flax flour. At birth, dams were switched to the AIN93 semi-purified diet. Mammary tumor incidence and multiplicity, induced by administering the offspring 5 mg 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) at the age of 50 days, was reduced in the whole wheat flour-exposed offspring and increased in the defatted flax-exposed offspring. To identify the mechanisms mediating the effects of in utero dietary exposures, changes in mammary gland morphology and gene expression were assessed before puberty onset (3 weeks of age) and at the time rats are most susceptible to malignant transformation (8 weeks of age). The number of terminal end buds (TEBs), i.e., the targets of malignant transformation, was reduced in the mammary glands of whole wheat- and oat flour-exposed offspring, as compared to the controls. Further, the number of apoptotic epithelial cells (based on ISOL assay) was elevated in the whole wheat flour offspring, but no changes in cell proliferation (PCNA), estrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) or cyclin D1 mRNA or protein levels were seen. The mRNA and/or protein levels of BRCA1 and p53 were significantly increased in the mammary glands of whole wheat flour offspring. Further, the levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of DNA damage, were significantly reduced in these rats, suggesting that maternal dietary exposure to whole wheat during pregnancy may reduce offspring's breast cancer risk by improving DNA damage repair mechanisms."

Our results indicated that among the 18 genes analyzed, genes encoding enzymes that promote synthesis of bioactive GAs, and genes that act as positive components in the GA response pathways were up-regulated in hybrid, whereas genes encoding enzymes that deactivate bioactive GAs, and genes that act as negative components of GA response pathways were down-regulated in hybrid. Moreover, the putative wheat GA receptor gene TaGID1, and two GA responsive genes participating in internode elongation, GIP and XET, were also up-regulated in hybrid.

"21952208","abstracttext","Vernalization promotes flowering in winter wheat cultivars, whereas spring wheat cultivars are able to transition from vegetative to reproductive phase without vernalization. The wheat vernalization requirement is mainly controlled by the major locus Vrn-1, an APETALA1/FRUITFULL MADS-box gene homolog. To study natural variation of the vernalization requirement in a wild progenitor of common wheat, we sequenced the Vrn-D(t)1 locus in four accessions of Aegilops tauschii Coss. Some structural mutations were found in the promoter and first intron regions of Vrn-D(t)1, and haplotype analysis was conducted to examine the distribution of each identified mutation within 211 accessions of Ae. tauschii germplasm. Out of the total, nine accessions, which were originally collected in Afghanistan and Pakistan, contained deletions of a 5.4-kb sequence in the critical region of the Vrn-D(t)1 first intron. The 5.4-kb deletion mutation appeared independently of the dominant allele of the common wheat Vrn-D1 locus. The large deletion was absolutely associated with a lack of vernalization requirement for flowering under long-day conditions, but had no influence on heading date under field growth conditions. The levels of Vrn-1 and WFT transcript increased in the Ae. tauschii accessions having the large deletion. Identification of natural mutant accessions with a loss of vernalization requirement indicates the agricultural significance of Ae. tauschii as a genetic resource for wheat breeding."

"21829479","abstracttext","A concern associated with the growing of genetically modified (GM) crops is that they could adversely affect non-target organisms. We assessed the impact of several transgenic powdery mildew-resistant spring wheat lines on insect herbivores. The GM lines carried either the Pm3b gene from hexaploid wheat, which confers race-specific resistance to powdery mildew, or the less specific anti-fungal barley seed chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase. In addition to the non-transformed control lines, several conventional spring wheat varieties and barley and triticale were included for comparison. During two consecutive growing seasons, powdery mildew infection and the abundance of and damage by naturally occurring herbivores were estimated under semi-field conditions in a convertible glasshouse and in the field. Mildew was reduced on the Pm3b-transgenic lines but not on the chitinase/glucanase-expressing lines. Abundance of aphids was negatively correlated with powdery mildew in the convertible glasshouse, with Pm3b wheat plants hosting significantly more aphids than their mildew-susceptible controls. In contrast, aphid densities did not differ between GM plants and their non-transformed controls in the field, probably because of low mildew and aphid pressure at this location. Likewise, the GM wheat lines did not affect the abundance of or damage by the herbivores Oulema melanopus (L.) and Chlorops pumilionis Bjerk. Although a previous study has revealed that some of the GM wheat lines show pleiotropic effects under field conditions, their effect on herbivorous insects appears to be low."

This includes an on-going project by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium to assemble its large and complex genome, which is hexaploid and contains three closely related 'homoeologous' copies for each chromosome. This multi-national effort avoids the complications polyploidy entails for correct assembly of the genome by sequencing flow-sorted chromosome arms one at a time. Here we report on an alternate approach, a direct homoeolog-specific assembly of the expressed portion of the genome, the transcriptome."
"22989011","abstracttext_results","After assessment of the ability of various assemblers to generate homoeolog-specific assemblies, we employed a two-stage assembly process to produce a high-quality assembly of the transcriptome of hexaploid wheat from Roche-454 and Illumina GAIIx paired-end sequence reads. The assembly process made use of a rapid partitioning of expressed sequences into homoeologous clusters, followed by a parallel high-fidelity assembly of each cluster on a 1150-processor compute cloud. We assessed assembly quality through comparison to known wheat gene sequences and found that in ca. 98.5% of cases the assembly was sufficiently accurate for homoeologous triplets to be cleanly separated into either two or three separate contigs. Comparison to publicly available transcript collections suggests that the assembly covers ~75-80% of the complete transcriptome."
"22989011","abstracttext_conclusions","This work therefore describes the first homoeolog-specific sequence assembly of the wheat transcriptome and provides a reference transcriptome for future wheat research. Furthermore, our assembly methodology is transferable to other polyploid organisms."
"20920212","articletitle","The RAD51 and DMC1 homoeologous genes of bread wheat: cloning, molecular characterization and expression analysis."
"20920212","abstracttext_background","Meiotic recombination in eukaryotes requires two homologues of the E. coli RecA proteins: Rad51 and Dmc1. Both proteins play important roles in the binding of single stranded DNA, homology search, strand invasion and strand exchange. Meiotic recombination has been well studied in Arabidopsis, rice, maize and the orthologues of RAD51 and DMC1 have been characterized. However genetic analysis of the RAD51 and DMC1 genes in bread wheat has been hampered due to the absence of complete sequence information and because of the existence of multiple copies of each gene in the hexaploid wheat genome."
"20920212","abstracttext_findings","In this study we have identified that TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 homoeologues are located on group 7 and group 5 chromosomes of hexaploid wheat, respectively. Comparative sequence analysis of cDNA derived from the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 homoeologues revealed limited sequence divergence at both the nucleotide and the amino acid level. Indeed, comparisons between the predicted amino acid sequences of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 and those of other eukaryotes reveal a high degree of evolutionary conservation. Despite the high degree of sequence conservation at the nucleotide level, genome-specific primers for cDNAs of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 were developed to evaluate expression patterns of individual homoeologues during meiosis. QRT-PCR analysis showed that expression of the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 cDNA homoeologues was largely restricted to meiotic tissue, with elevated levels observed during the stages of prophase I when meiotic recombination occurs. All three homoeologues of both strand-exchange proteins (TaRAD51 and TaDMC1) are expressed in wheat."
"20920212","abstracttext_conclusions","Bread wheat contains three expressed copies of each of the TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 homoeologues. While differences were detected between the three cDNA homoeologues of TaRAD51 as well as the three homoeologues of TaDMC1, it is unlikely that the predicted amino acid substitutions would have an effect on the protein structure, based on our three-dimensional structure prediction analyses. There are differences in the levels of expression of the three homoeologues of TaRAD51 and TaDMC1 as determined by QRT-PCR and if these differences are reflected at the protein level, bread wheat may be more dependent upon a particular homoeologue to achieve full fertility than all three equally."

"20821031","abstracttext","Sucrose synthase catalyzes the reaction sucrose + UDP → UDP-glucose + fructose, the first step in the conversion of sucrose to starch in endosperm. Previous studies identified two tissue-specific, yet functionally redundant, sucrose synthase (SUS) genes, Sus1 and Sus2. In the present study, the wheat Sus2 orthologous gene (TaSus2) series was isolated and mapped on chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D. Based on sequencing in 61 wheat accessions, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected in TaSus2-2B. These formed two haplotypes (Hap-H and Hap-L), but no diversity was found in either TaSus2-2A or TaSus2-2D. Based on the sequences of the two haplotypes, we developed a co-dominant marker, TaSus2-2B ( tgw ), which amplified 423 or 381-bp fragments in different wheat accessions. TaSus2-2B ( tgw ) was located between markers Xbarc102.2 and Xbarc91 on chromosome 2BS in a RIL population from Xiaoyan 54 × Jing 411. Association analysis suggested that the two haplotypes were significantly associated with 1,000 grain weight (TGW) in 89 modern wheat varieties in the Chinese mini-core collection. Mean TGW difference between the two haplotypes over three cropping seasons was 4.26 g (varying from 3.71 to 4.94 g). Comparative genomics analysis detected major kernel weight QTLs not only in the chromosome region containing TaSus2-2B (tgw), but also in the collinear regions of TaSus2 on rice chromosome 7 and maize chromosome 9. The preferred Hap-H haplotype for high TGW underwent very strong positive selection in Chinese wheat breeding, but not in Europe. The geographic distribution of Hap-H was perhaps determined by both latitude and the intensity of selection in wheat breeding."
"21153397","articletitle","Dissection of QTL effects for root traits using a chromosome arm-specific mapping population in bread wheat."
"21153397","abstracttext","A high-resolution chromosome arm-specific mapping population was used in an attempt to locate/detect gene(s)/QTL for different root traits on the short arm of rye chromosome 1 (1RS) in bread wheat. This population consisted of induced homoeologous recombinants of 1RS with 1BS, each originating from a different crossover event and distinct from all other recombinants in the proportions of rye and wheat chromatin present. It provides a simple and powerful approach to detect even small QTL effects using fewer progeny. A promising empirical Bayes method was applied to estimate additive and epistatic effects for all possible marker pairs simultaneously in a single model. This method has an advantage for QTL analysis in minimizing the error variance and detecting interaction effects between loci with no main effect. A total of 15 QTL effects, 6 additive and 9 epistatic, were detected for different traits of root length and root weight in 1RS wheat. Epistatic interactions were further partitioned into inter-genomic (wheat and rye alleles) and intra-genomic (rye-rye or wheat-wheat alleles) interactions affecting various root traits. Four common regions were identified involving all the QTL for root traits. Two regions carried QTL for almost all the root traits and were responsible for all the epistatic interactions. Evidence for inter-genomic interactions is provided. Comparison of mean values supported the QTL detection."

"21499720","abstracttext","An improved understanding of the complex interactions between plants and aphids is emerging. Recognition of aphid feeding in plant tissues involves production of several defense response signaling pathways and downstream production of defense and detoxification compounds. Feeding by Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov), a serious pest of cereal crops worldwide, induces foliar deformity and chlorophyll loss during compatible wheat-D. noxia interactions. Experiments described here revealed significant differences in level and pattern of gene expression in defense response signaling and metabolic pathways between compatible and incompatible D. noxia-wheat interactions. The jasmonate (JA)-signaling genes LOX, AOS, and AOC were significantly more upregulated (~3- to 7 fold) in incompatible interactions than in compatible interactions (~2.5 to 3.5 fold) as early as 1 h post D. noxia infestation (hpi). Cellulose synthase, responsible for strengthening plant cell walls via cellulose production, was also more upregulated in incompatible interactions (4 to 7 fold) than in compatible interactions (1 to 3.5 fold). In contrast, glycolysis and citric acid cycle genes were significantly downregulated (~1.5 to 2 fold) in incompatible interactions and upregulated or less downregulated in compatible interactions from 6 to 72 hpi. Differences in expression of JA-signaling genes between feeding site tissues and non-feeding site tissues suggest that D. noxia defense response signals in wheat are restricted primarily to aphid feeding sites in the initial 6 hpi. This is the first report of differential upregulation of plant genes at 1 hpi in incompatible interactions involving aphid herbivory. Early wheat plant defense responses in incompatible D. noxia interactions at 1, 3, and 6 hpi appear to be important aspects of D. noxia resistance in wheat."

"22044756","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a common pathogen of wheat and maize throughout the world. Despite recent advances in the elucidation of the genetic basis of virulence, significant gaps in the regulatory network underlying pathogenesis remain to be filled. In particular, little is known at the molecular level about the overlap among mechanisms of pathogenicity on maize and wheat. G-protein signalling has been implicated in pathogenesis in F. graminearum, although the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the involvement of a putative phosducin-like gene (BDM1) in growth, development and pathogenesis in F. graminearum. Targeted deletion of BDM1 revealed roles in sexual and asexual sporulation, germ tube development, hyphal branching and mycelial morphology. During pathogenesis, BDM1 is required for wild-type levels of colonization of maize silk tissue and stalks, but is dispensable for the colonization of kernels. The deletion of BDM1 also reduced the virulence of F. graminearum during the infection of wheat seedlings and heads, resulting in a significant reduction in fungal biomass and a delayed spread of visual symptom expression (i.e. bleaching in heads). Furthermore, BDM1 is required for wild-type levels of deoxynivalenol biosynthesis during the infection of wheat heads and maize silks. In summation, BDM1 is one of the few genes characterized to date in F. graminearum involved in virulence during infection of both maize and wheat. Thus, the functional characterization of BDM1 has established a new regulatory link between pathogenesis in maize and wheat, and provides a genetic resource through which the regulatory networks underlying virulence in F. graminearum can be further elucidated."

"22278768","abstracttext","The wheat GPC-B1 gene located on chromosome 6B is an early regulator of senescence and affects remobilization of protein and minerals to the grain. GPC-B1 is a NAC transcription factor and has a paralogous copy on chromosome 2B in wheat, GPC-B2. The closest rice homolog to both wheat GPC genes is Os07g37920 which is located on rice chromosome 7 and is colinear with GPC-B2. Since rice is a diploid species with a sequenced genome, we initiated the study of Os07g37920 to develop a simpler model to study senescence and mineral remobilization in cereals. We developed eleven independent RNA interference transgenic rice lines (Os07g37920-RNAi) and 10 over-expressing transgenic lines (Os07g37920-OE), but none of them showed differences in senescence. Transgenic Os07g37920-RNAi rice plants had reduced proportions of viable pollen grains and were male-sterile, but were able to produce seeds by cross pollination. Analysis of the flower morphology of the transgenic rice plants showed that anthers failed to dehisce. Transgenic Os07g37920-OE lines showed no sterility or anther dehiscence problems. Os07g37920 transcript levels were higher in stamens compared to leaves and significantly reduced in the transgenic Os07g37920-RNAi plants. Wheat GPC genes showed the opposite transcription profile (higher transcript levels in leaves than in flowers) and plants carrying knock-out mutations of all GPC-1 and GPC-2 genes exhibited delayed senescence but normal anther dehiscence and fertility. These results indicate a functional divergence of the homologous wheat and rice NAC genes and suggest the need for separate studies of the function and targets of these transcription factors in wheat and rice."

"22531789","abstracttext","Rye B chromosomes, which are supernumerary chromosomes dispensable for the host but increase in number by non-disjunction after meiosis, have been reported to affect meiotic homoeologous pairing in wheat-rye hybrids. The effect of a rye B chromosome (B) and its segments (B-9 and B-10) on homoeologous pairing was studied in hybrids between common wheat (2n=42) and Aegilops variabilis (2n=28), with reference to the Ph1 gene located on wheat chromosome 5B. The B-9 and B-10 chromosomes are derived from reciprocal translocations between a wheat and the B chromosomes, and the former had the B pericentromeric segment and the latter had the B distal segment. Both the B and B-9 chromosomes suppressed homoeologous pairing when chromosome 5B was absent. On the other hand, the B-9 and B-10 chromosomes promoted homoeologous pairing when 5B was present. On pairing suppression, B-9 had a greater effect in one dose than in two doses, and B-9 had a greater effect than B-10 had in one dose. These results suggested that the effect of the B chromosomes on homoeologous pairing was not confined to a specific region and that the intensity of the effect varied depending on the presence or absence of 5B and also on the segment and dose of the B chromosome. The mean chiasma frequency (10.23) in a hybrid (2n=36) possessing 5B and one B-9 was considerably higher than that (2.78) of a hybrid (2n=35) possessing 5B alone, and was comparable with that (14.09) of a hybrid (2n=34) lacking 5B. This fact suggested that the B chromosome or its segment can be used in introducing alien genes into wheat by inducing homoeologous pairing between wheat and alien chromosome."

"22658131","abstracttext_background","Powdery mildew, caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis, is a major problem in cereal production as it can reduce quality and yield. B. graminis has evolved eight distinct formae speciales (f.sp.) which display strict host specialization. In the last decade, powdery mildew has emerged on triticale, the artificial intergeneric hybrid between wheat and rye. This emergence is probably triggered by a host range expansion of the wheat powdery mildew B. graminis f.sp. tritici. To gain more precise information about the evolutionary processes that led to this host range expansion, we pursued a combined pathological and genetic approach."
"22658131","abstracttext_results","B. graminis isolates were sampled from triticale, wheat and rye from different breeding regions in Europe. Pathogenicity tests showed that isolates collected from triticale are highly pathogenic on most of the tested triticale cultivars. Moreover, these isolates were also able to infect several wheat cultivars (their previous hosts), although a lower aggressiveness was observed compared to isolates collected from wheat. Phylogenetic analysis of nuclear gene regions identified two statistically significant clades, which to a certain extent correlated with pathogenicity. No differences in virulence profiles were found among the sampled regions, but the distribution of genetic variation demonstrated to be geography dependent. A multilocus haplotype network showed that haplotypes pathogenic on triticale are distributed at different sites in the network, but always clustered at or near the tips of the network."

"23420880","abstracttext","Flowering is a critical period in the life cycle of flowering plant species, resulting in an irreversible commitment of significant resources. Wheat is photoperiod sensitive, flowering only when daylength surpasses a critical length; however, photoperiod insensitivity (PI) has been selected by plant breeders for >40 years to enhance yield in certain environments. Control of flowering time has been greatly facilitated by the development of molecular markers for the Photoperiod-1 (Ppd-1) homeoloci, on the group 2 chromosomes. In the current study, an allelic series of BC2F4 lines in the winter wheat cultivars 'Robigus' and 'Alchemy' was developed to elucidate the influence on flowering of eight gene variants from the B- and D-genomes of bread wheat and the A-genome of durum wheat. Allele effects were tested in short, natural, and extended photoperiods in the field and controlled environments. Across genetic background and treatment, the D-genome PI allele, Ppd-D1a, had a more potent effect on reducing flowering time than Ppd-B1a. However, there was significant donor allele effect for both Ppd-D1a and Ppd-B1a, suggesting the presence of linked modifier genes and/or additional sources of latent sensitivity. Development of Ppd-A1a BC2F4 lines derived from synthetic hexaploid wheat provided an opportunity to compare directly the flowering time effect of the A-genome allele from durum with the B- and D-genome variants from bread wheat for the first time. Analyses indicated that the reducing effect of Ppd-A1a is comparable with that of Ppd-D1a, confirming it as a useful alternative source of PI."
"23730729","articletitle","TaEIL1, a wheat homologue of AtEIN3, acts as a negative regulator in the wheat-stripe rust fungus interaction."
"23730729","abstracttext","Transcription factors (TFs) play crucial roles in the transcriptional regulation of plant development and defence responses. Increasing evidence has implicated ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3) in the plant defence response to pathogen infection and environmental stimuli. However, the role of EIN3 in wheat resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is not clear. Here, TaEIL1 was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) based on a sequence fragment from a wheat-Pst interaction cDNA library. The TaEIL1 protein contains a typical EIN3-binding domain, and transient expression analyses indicated that TaEIL1 is localized in the nucleus. Yeast one-hybrid assay revealed that TaEIL1 exhibits transcriptional activity, and its C-terminus is necessary for the activation of transcription. TaEIL1 transcripts were regulated by environmental stress stimuli and were decreased under salicylic acid (SA) treatment. When wheat leaves were challenged with Pst, the transcript level of TaEIL1 in the compatible interaction was approximately three times higher than that in the incompatible interaction. Knocking down TaEIL1 through the Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) system attenuated the growth of Pst, with shortened hyphae and reduced hyphal branches, haustorial mother cells and colony size. Moreover, enhanced necrosis was triggered by the Pst avirulent race CYR23, indicating that the hypersensitive response was strengthened in TaEIL1-silenced wheat plants. Thus, the up-regulation of defence-related genes and increased sucrose abundance might contribute to the enhanced disease resistance of wheat to the virulent race CYR31. Taken together, the results suggested that the suppression of TaEIL1 transcripts could enhance the resistance of wheat to stripe rust fungus."

"23337356","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the fungal pathogen mainly responsible for Fusarium head blight (FHB) of cereal crops, which attacks wheat spikes, reducing crop production and quality of grain by producing trichothecene mycotoxins. Several cytohistological studies showed that spike infection is associated with the production of cell wall degrading enzymes. Wheat tissue, as in other commelinoid monocot plants, is particularly rich in xylan which can be hydrolyzed by fungal endo-1,4-β-xylanase. The FG_03624 is one of the most expressed xylanase genes in wheat spikes 3 days after inoculation and was heterologously expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant protein (22.7 kDa) possessed xylanase activity and induced cell death and hydrogen peroxide accumulation in wheat leaves infiltrated with 10 ng/μl or in wheat lemma surface treated with 20 ng/μl. This effect reflects that observed with other described fungal xylanases (from Trichoderma reesei, Trichoderma viride and Botrytis cinerea) with which the FG_03624 protein shares a stretch of amino acids reported as essential for elicitation of necrotic responses. Several F. graminearum mutants with the FG_03624 gene disrupted were obtained, and showed about 40% reduction of xylanase activity in comparison to the wild type when grown in culture with xylan as carbon source. However, they were fully virulent when assayed by single floret inoculation on wheat cvs. Bobwhite and Nandu. This is the first report of a xylanase able to induce hypersensitive-like symptoms on a monocot plant."
"23271982","articletitle","Wheat TILLING mutants show that the vernalization gene VRN1 down-regulates the flowering repressor VRN2 in leaves but is not essential for flowering."
"23271982","abstracttext","Most of the natural variation in wheat vernalization response is determined by allelic differences in the MADS-box transcription factor VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1). Extended exposures to low temperatures during the winter (vernalization) induce VRN1 expression and promote the transition of the apical meristem to the reproductive phase. In contrast to its Arabidopsis homolog (APETALA1), which is mainly expressed in the apical meristem, VRN1 is also expressed at high levels in the leaves, but its function in this tissue is not well understood. Using tetraploid wheat lines with truncation mutations in the two homoeologous copies of VRN1 (henceforth vrn1-null mutants), we demonstrate that a central role of VRN1 in the leaves is to maintain low transcript levels of the VRN2 flowering repressor after vernalization. Transcript levels of VRN2 were gradually down-regulated during vernalization in both mutant and wild-type genotypes, but were up-regulated after vernalization only in the vrn1-null mutants. The up-regulation of VRN2 delayed flowering by repressing the transcription of FT, a flowering-integrator gene that encodes a mobile protein that is transported from the leaves to the apical meristem to induce flowering. The role of VRN2 in the delayed flowering of the vrn1-null mutant was confirmed using double vrn1-vrn2-null mutants, which flowered two months earlier than the vrn1-null mutants. Both mutants produced normal flowers and seeds demonstrating that VRN1 is not essential for wheat flowering, which contradicts current flowering models. This result does not diminish the importance of VRN1 in the seasonal regulation of wheat flowering. The up-regulation of VRN1 during winter is required to maintain low transcript levels of VRN2, accelerate the induction of FT in the leaves, and regulate a timely flowering in the spring. Our results also demonstrate the existence of redundant wheat flowering genes that may provide new targets for engineering wheat varieties better adapted to changing environments."

"24031986","abstracttext","Agro-industrial wastes such as sugarcane bagasse, wheat bran, rice bran, corn cob and wheat straw are cheapest and abundantly available natural carbon sources. The present study was aimed to production of amylase and xylanase simultaneously using agro-industrial waste as the sole carbon source. Seven thermophilic strains of actinomycete were isolated from the mushroom compost. Among of these, strain designated MSC702 having high potential to utilize agro-industrial wastes for the production of amylase and xylanase. Strain MSC702 was identified as novel species of Streptomyces through morphological characterization and 16S rRNA gene sequence. Enzyme production was determined using 1% (w/v) of various agro-industrial waste in production medium containing (g/100mL): K2HPO4 (0.1), (NH4)2SO4 (0.1), NaCl (0.1), MgSO4 (0.1) at pH 7.0 after incubation of 48 h at 50°C. The amylase activity (373.89 IU/mL) and xylanase activity (30.15 IU/mL) was maximum in rice bran. The decreasing order of amylase and xylanase activity in different type of agro-industrial wastes were found rice bran (RB) > corn cob (CC) > wheat bran (WB) > wheat straw (WS) > sugarcane bagasse (SB) and rice bran (RB) > wheat bran (WB) > wheat straw (WS) > sugarcane bagasse (SB) > corn cob (CC), respectively. Mixed effect of different agro-industrial wastes was examined in different ratios. Enzyme yield of amylase and xylanase was ~1.3 and ~2.0 fold higher with RB: WB in 1:2 ratio."

"25105230","abstracttext","Vitamin E is an essential human nutrient that was first isolated from wheat. Emmer wheat, the cereal of Old World agriculture and a precursor to durum wheat, grows wild in the Fertile Crescent. Evolution Canyon, Israel, provides a microsite that models effects of contrasting environments. The north-facing and south-facing slopes exhibit low and high stress environments, respectively. Wild emmer wheat seeds were collected from both slopes and seed tocochromanol contents measured to test the hypothesis that high stress alters emmer wheat seed tocol-omics. Seeds from high stress areas contained more total vitamin E (108±15 nmol/g) than seeds from low stress environments (80±17 nmol/g, P=.0004). Vitamin E profiles within samples from these different environments revealed significant differences in isoform concentrations. Within each region, β- plus γ-tocotrienols represented the highest concentration of wheat tocotrienols (high stress, P<.0001; low stress, P<.0001), while α-tocopherol represented the highest concentration of the tocopherols (high stress, P=.0002; low stress, P<.0001). Percentages of both δ-tocotrienol and δ-tocopherol increased in high stress conditions. Changes under higher stress apparently are due to increased pathway flux toward more tocotrienol production. The production of more δ-isoforms suggests increased flow through a divergent path controlled by the VTE1 gene. Hence, stress conditions alter plant responses such that vitamin E profiles are changed, likely an attempt to provide additional antioxidant activity to promote seed viability and longevity."

"26335335","abstracttext","Targeted Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLING) is a reverse genetics approach to identify novel sequence variation in genomes, with the aims of investigating gene function and/or developing useful alleles for breeding. Despite recent advances in wheat genomics, most current TILLING methods are low to medium in throughput, being based on PCR amplification of the target genes. We performed a pilot-scale evaluation of TILLING in wheat by next-generation sequencing through exon capture. An oligonucleotide-based enrichment array covering ~2 Mbp of wheat coding sequence was used to carry out exon capture and sequencing on three mutagenised lines of wheat containing previously-identified mutations in the TaGA20ox1 homoeologous genes. After testing different mapping algorithms and settings, candidate SNPs were identified by mapping to the IWGSC wheat Chromosome Survey Sequences. Where sequence data for all three homoeologues were found in the reference, mutant calls were unambiguous; however, where the reference lacked one or two of the homoeologues, captured reads from these genes were mis-mapped to other homoeologues, resulting either in dilution of the variant allele frequency or assignment of mutations to the wrong homoeologue. Competitive PCR assays were used to validate the putative SNPs and estimate cut-off levels for SNP filtering. At least 464 high-confidence SNPs were detected across the three mutagenized lines, including the three known alleles in TaGA20ox1, indicating a mutation rate of ~35 SNPs per Mb, similar to that estimated by PCR-based TILLING. This demonstrates the feasibility of using exon capture for genome re-sequencing as a method of mutation detection in polyploid wheat, but accurate mutation calling will require an improved genomic reference with more comprehensive coverage of homoeologues."

Yield is usually broken down into three components; number of spikes per area, grain number per spike, and grain weight (TGW). In polyploid wheat, studies have identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) which affect TGW, yet few have been validated and fine-mapped using independent germplasm, thereby having limited impact in breeding."
"25034643","abstracttext_results","In this study we identified a major QTL for TGW, yield and green canopy duration on wheat chromosome 6A of the Spark x Rialto population, across 12 North European environments. Using independent germplasm in the form of BC2 and BC4 near isogenic lines (NILs), we validated the three QTL effects across environments. In four of the five experiments the Rialto 6A introgression gave significant improvements in yield (5.5%) and TGW (5.1%), with morphometric measurements showing that the increased grain weight was a result of wider grains. The extended green canopy duration associated with the high yielding/TGW Rialto allele was comprised of two independent effects; earlier flowering and delayed final maturity, and was expressed stably across the five environments. The wheat homologue (TaGW2) of a rice gene associated with increased TGW and grain width was mapped within the QTL interval. However, no polymorphisms were identified in the coding sequence between the parents."

"25288928","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by the filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum is one of the most severe diseases threatening the production of small grains. Infected grains are often contaminated with mycotoxins such as zearalenone and trichothecences. During survey of contamination by FHB in rice grains, we found a bacterial isolate, designated as BN1, antagonistic to F. graminearum. The strain BN1 had branching vegetative hyphae and spores, and its aerial hyphae often had long, straight filaments bearing spores. The 16S rRNA gene of BN1 had 100% sequence identity with those found in several Streptomyces species. Phylogenetic analysis of ITS regions showed that BN1 grouped with S. sampsonii with 77% bootstrap value, suggesting that BN1 was not a known Streptomyces species. In addition, the efficacy of the BN1 strain against F. graminearum strains was tested both in vitro and in vivo. Wheat seedling length was significantly decreased by F. graminearum infection. However, this effect was mitigated when wheat seeds were treated with BN1 spore suspension prior to F. graminearum infection. BN1 also significantly decreased FHB severity when it was sprayed onto wheat heads, whereas BN1 was not effective when wheat heads were point inoculated. These results suggest that spraying of BN1 spores onto wheat heads during the wheat flowering season can be efficient for plant protection.

"25962727","abstracttext_background","Next-generation sequencing technologies provide new opportunities to identify the genetic components responsible for trait variation. However, in species with large polyploid genomes, such as bread wheat, the ability to rapidly identify genes underlying quantitative trait loci (QTL) remains non-trivial. To overcome this, we introduce a novel pipeline that analyses, by RNA-sequencing, multiple near-isogenic lines segregating for a targeted QTL."
"25962727","abstracttext_results","We use this approach to characterize a major and widely utilized seed dormancy QTL located on chromosome 4AL. It exploits the power and mapping resolution afforded by large multi-parent mapping populations, whilst reducing complexity by using multi-allelic contrasts at the targeted QTL region. Our approach identifies two adjacent candidate genes within the QTL region belonging to the ABA-induced Wheat Plasma Membrane 19 family. One of them, PM19-A1, is highly expressed during grain maturation in dormant genotypes. The second, PM19-A2, shows changes in sequence causing several amino acid alterations between dormant and non-dormant genotypes. We confirm that PM19 genes are positive regulators of seed dormancy."
"25962727","abstracttext_conclusions","The efficient identification of these strong candidates demonstrates the utility of our transcriptomic pipeline for rapid QTL to gene mapping. By using this approach we are able to provide a comprehensive genetic analysis of the major source of grain dormancy in wheat. Further analysis across a diverse panel of bread and durum wheats indicates that this important dormancy QTL predates hexaploid wheat. The use of these genes by wheat breeders could assist in the elimination of pre-harvest sprouting in wheat."

"26107972","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and barley, is one of the most economically destructive pathogens of these grains worldwide. Recent population genetic studies of the pathogen obtained from wheat in North America supported population subdivision in part correlated with the spectrum of trichothecene mycotoxins (chemotype) produced by individuals within each population. In contrast, a recent study of F. graminearum obtained from diseased barley in the upper Midwestern United States concluded that only a single population was present, consisting of individuals with various chemotypes. To test whether strains derived from different hosts potentially have different population dynamics, we obtained the barley strains used in the previous study and compared them with wheat strains isolated at a similar time and geographic origin. A total of 247 F. graminearum isolates from barley were assigned firmly into two clusters using a Bayesian clustering method. Subdivision within the barley population corresponded to the previously described NA1 (correlated with the 15ADON chemotype) and NA2 (correlated with the 3ADON chemotype) populations from wheat. However, in both sampling periods the barley population exhibited a higher level of genetic differentiation between NA1 and NA2 populations, fewer admixed individuals and evidence of unidirectional gene introgression (15ADON strains with NA2 genetic backgrounds). These results suggest less recombination between NA1 and NA2 populations on barley compared with wheat. The frequency of 3ADON chemotype strains in the most recently surveyed barley population suggests a latitudinal cline from the northern (49%), central (40%) to the southern (29%) sampling area. The potential to produce a novel trichothecene, 3α-acetoxy,7α,15-dihydroxy-12,13-epoxytrichothe-9-ene (NX-2), was not detected in the barley population but occurred at a low rate (2.4%) in the wheat population."

The order and direction of 480 contigs, corresponding to 87% of the total length of 6B, were determined. We also characterized the contigs that contained a part of the nucleolus organizer region or centromere based on their positions on the RH map and the assembled BAC clone sequences.

"27462322","abstracttext","Following the emergence of the Ug99 lineage of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) a collective international effort has been undertaken to identify new sources of wheat stem rust resistance effective against these races. Analyses were undertaken in a collection of wheat genotypes gathered from across Africa to identify stem rust resistance effective against the Pgt races found in Eastern and Southern Africa. The African wheat collection consisted of historic genotypes collected in Kenya, South Africa, Ethiopia, Sudan, Zambia, Morocco, and Tunisia, and current South African breeding lines. Both Bayesian cluster and principal coordinate analyses placed the wheat lines from Sudan in a distinct group, but indicated a degree of genetic relatedness among the other wheat lines despite originating from countries across Africa. Seedling screens with Pgt race PTKST, pedigree information and marker haplotype analysis confirmed the presence of Sr2, Sr36, Sr24, Sr31, and Lr34/Yr18/Sr57 in a number of the lines. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) undertaken with Diversiry Arrays Technology (DArT) and stem rust (Sr) gene associated markers and Stem Area Infected (SAI) and Reaction Type (RT) field phenotypes, collected from trials carried out across two seasons in Kenya in 2009 and in South Africa in 2011, identified 29 marker-trait associations (MTA). Three MTA were in common between SAI and RT, with the biggest effect MTA being found on chromosome 6AS. Two wheat lines, W1406 and W6979 that exhibited high levels of adult plant stem rust resistance were selected to generate bi-parental mapping populations. Only the MTA on chromosomes 6AS and 3BS, and the locus Lr34/Yr18/Sr57 were confirmed following QTL mapping. Additional stem rust resistance QTL, not detected by the GWAS, were found on chromosomes 2BS, 2DL, 3DL, and 4D."

"28941315","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by the pathogenic fungus Puccinia triticina (Pt), is one of the most serious biotic threats to sustainable wheat production worldwide. This obligate biotrophic pathogen is prevalent worldwide and is known for rapid adaptive evolution to overcome resistant wheat varieties. Novel disease control approaches are therefore required to minimize the yield losses caused by Pt. Having shown previously the potential of host-delivered RNA interference (HD-RNAi) in functional screening of Pt genes involved in pathogenesis, we here evaluated the use of this technology in transgenic wheat plants as a method to achieve protection against wheat leaf rust (WLR) infection. Stable expression of hairpin RNAi constructs with sequence homology to Pt MAP-kinase (PtMAPK1) or a cyclophilin (PtCYC1) encoding gene in susceptible wheat plants showed efficient silencing of the corresponding genes in the interacting fungus resulting in disease resistance throughout the T 2 generation. Inhibition of Pt proliferation in transgenic lines by in planta-induced RNAi was associated with significant reduction in target fungal transcript abundance and reduced fungal biomass accumulation in highly resistant plants. Disease protection was correlated with the presence of siRNA molecules specific to targeted fungal genes in the transgenic lines harbouring the complementary HD-RNAi construct. This work demonstrates that generating transgenic wheat plants expressing RNAi-inducing transgenes to silence essential genes in rust fungi can provide effective disease resistance, thus opening an alternative way for developing rust-resistant crops."

They were all haploid based on their guard cell length of 42.78-42.90 μm compared with the diploid control of 71.52 μm, and their chromosome number of 21 compared with the diploid control of 42. In addition, according to anthers, plant height, and molecular markers, the haploid plants were divided into two types. Eight of them showed dwarf, having no anthers, and the special band of Rht10, and the other three plants displayed normal plant height, having anthers, and not containing the special band of Rht10, indicating that they were originated from the MS2/Rht10 and ms2/rht10 female gametes, respectively."

"29259968","abstracttext","Abiotic stresses such as, drought, heat, salinity, and flooding threaten global food security. Crop genetic improvement with increased resilience to abiotic stresses is a critical component of crop breeding strategies. Wheat is an important cereal crop and a staple food source globally. Enhanced drought tolerance in wheat is critical for sustainable food production and global food security. Recent advances in drought tolerance research have uncovered many key genes and transcription regulators governing morpho-physiological traits. Genes controlling root architecture and stomatal development play an important role in soil moisture extraction and its retention, and therefore have been targets of molecular breeding strategies for improving drought tolerance. In this systematic review, we have summarized evidence of beneficial contributions of root and stomatal traits to plant adaptation to drought stress. Specifically, we discuss a few key genes such as, DRO1 in rice and ERECTA in Arabidopsis and rice that were identified to be the enhancers of drought tolerance via regulation of root traits and transpiration efficiency. Additionally, we highlight several transcription factor families, such as, ERF (ethylene response factors), DREB (dehydration responsive element binding), ZFP (zinc finger proteins), WRKY, and MYB that were identified to be both positive and negative regulators of drought responses in wheat, rice, maize, and/or Arabidopsis. The overall aim of this review is to provide an overview of candidate genes that have been identified as regulators of drought response in plants. The lack of a reference genome sequence for wheat and non-transgenic approaches for manipulation of gene functions in wheat in the past had impeded high-resolution interrogation of functional elements, including genes and QTLs, and their application in cultivar improvement. The recent developments in wheat genomics and reverse genetics, including the availability of a gold-standard reference genome sequence and advent of genome editing technologies, are expected to aid in deciphering of the functional roles of genes and regulatory networks underlying adaptive phenological traits, and utilizing the outcomes of such studies in developing drought tolerant cultivars."

"29079898","abstracttext_key message","TaRNAC1 is a constitutively and predominantly root-expressed NAC transcription factor. TaRNAC1 overexpression in wheat roots confers increased root length, biomass and drought tolerance and improved grain yield under water limitation. A large and deep root system is an important trait for yield sustainability of dryland cereal crops in drought-prone environments. This study investigated the role of a predominantly root-expressed NAC transcription factor from wheat (TaRNAC1) in the root growth. Expression analysis showed that TaRNAC1 was a constitutively expressed gene with high level expression in the roots and was not drought-upregulated. Overexpression of TaRNAC1 in wheat using a predominantly root-expressed promoter resulted in increased root length and biomass observed at the early growth stage and a marked increase in the maturity root biomass with dry root weight of > 70% higher than that of the wild type plants. Analysis of some root growth-related genes revealed that the expression level of GA3-ox2, which encodes GIBBERELLIN 3-OXIDASE catalysing the conversion of inactive gibberellin (GA) to active GA, was elevated in the roots of transgenic wheat. TaRNAC1 overexpressing transgenic wheat showed more dehydration tolerance under polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment and produced more aboveground biomass and grain under water-limited conditions than the wild type plants. These data suggest that TaRNAC1 may play a role in root growth and be used as a molecular tool for potential enlargement of root system in wheat."

TaAMT1;1a, TaAMT1;1b, and TaAMT1;3a-GFP were localized in the plasma membrane in tobacco leaves, and TaAMT1;1a, TaAMT1;1b , and TaAMT1;3a successfully complemented a yeast 31019b strain in which ammonium uptake was deficient. In addition, the expression of TaAMT1;1b in an Arabidopsis AMT quadruple mutant ( qko ) successfully restored [Formula: see text] uptake ability. Resupply of [Formula: see text] rapidly increased cellular [Formula: see text] contents and suppressed expression of TaAMT1;3a , but not of TaAMT;1;1a and TaAMT1;1b expressions. Expression of TaAMT1;1a, TaAMT1;1b , and TaAMT1;3a was not changed in leaves after [Formula: see text] resupply. In contrast, nitrogen (N) deprivation induced TaAMT1;1a, TaAMT1;1b , and TaAMT1;3a gene expressions in the roots and leaves. Expression analysis in the leaves of the stem rust-susceptible wheat line ""Little Club"" and the rust-tolerant strain ""Mini 2761"" revealed that TaAMT1;1a, TaAMT1;1b , and TaAMT1;3a were specifically induced in the former but not in the latter. Rust-susceptible wheat plants grown under N-free conditions exhibited a lower disease index than plants grown with [Formula: see text] as the sole N source in the medium after infection with Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici , suggesting that [Formula: see text] and its transport may facilitate the infection of wheat stem rust disease.

However, little is known about the genetic basis of the super-short life of Apogee wheat."
"29089022","abstracttext_results","In this study, Apogee was crossed with a strong winter wheat cultivar 'Overland', and 858 F 2 plants were generated and tested in a greenhouse under constant warm temperature and long days. Apogee wheat was found to have the early alleles for four flowering time genes, which were ranked in the order of vrn-A1 > VRN-B1 > vrn-D3 > PPD-D1 according to their effect intensity. All these Apogee alleles for early flowering showed complete or partial dominance effects in the F 2 population. Surprisingly, Apogee was found to have the same alleles at vrn-A1a and vrn-D3a for early flowering as observed in winter wheat cultivar 'Jagger.' It was also found that the vrn-A1a gene was epistatic to VRN-B1 and vrn-D3. The dominant vrn-D3a alone was not sufficient to cause the transition from vegetative to reproductive development in winter plants without vernalization but was able to accelerate flowering in those plants that carry the vrn-A1a or Vrn-B1 alleles.

"29858949","abstracttext_key message","We identified 21 new and stable QTL, and 11 QTL clusters for yield-related traits in three bread wheat populations using the wheat 90 K SNP assay. Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for yield-related traits and closely linked molecular markers is important in order to identify gene/QTL for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding. The objectives of the present study were to identify QTL for yield-related traits and dissect the relationships among different traits in three wheat recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations derived from crosses Doumai × Shi 4185 (D × S), Gaocheng 8901 × Zhoumai 16 (G × Z) and Linmai 2 × Zhong 892 (L × Z). Using the available high-density linkage maps previously constructed with the wheat 90 K iSelect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, 65, 46 and 53 QTL for 12 traits were identified in the three RIL populations, respectively. Among them, 34, 23 and 27 were likely to be new QTL. Eighteen common QTL were detected across two or three populations. Eleven QTL clusters harboring multiple QTL were detected in different populations, and the interval 15.5-32.3 cM around the Rht-B1 locus on chromosome 4BS harboring 20 QTL is an important region determining grain yield (GY). Thousand-kernel weight (TKW) is significantly affected by kernel width and plant height (PH), whereas flag leaf width can be used to select lines with large kernel number per spike. Eleven candidate genes were identified, including eight cloned genes for kernel, heading date (HD) and PH-related traits as well as predicted genes for TKW, spike length and HD. The closest SNP markers of stable QTL or QTL clusters can be used for MAS in wheat breeding using kompetitive allele-specific PCR or semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR assays for improvement of GY."

"31049633","abstracttext_key message","Introgressing one-eighth of synthetic hexaploid wheat genome through a double top-cross plus a two-phase selection is an effective strategy to develop high-yielding wheat varieties. The continued expansion of the world population and the likely onset of climate change combine to form a major crop breeding challenge. Genetic advances in most crop species to date have largely relied on recombination and reassortment within a relatively narrow gene pool. Here, we demonstrate an efficient wheat breeding strategy for improving yield potentials by introgression of multiple genomic regions of de novo synthesized wheat. The method relies on an initial double top-cross (DTC), in which one parent is synthetic hexaploid wheat (SHW), followed by a two-phase selection procedure. A genotypic analysis of three varieties (Shumai 580, Shumai 969 and Shumai 830) released from this program showed that each harbors a unique set of genomic regions inherited from the SHW parent. The first two varieties were generated from very small populations, whereas the third used a more conventional scale of selection since one of bread wheat parents was a pre-breeding material. The three varieties had remarkably enhanced yield potential compared to those developed by conventional breeding. A widely accepted consensus among crop breeders holds that introducing unadapted germplasm, such as landraces, as parents into a breeding program is a risky proposition, since the size of the breeding population required to overcome linkage drag becomes too daunting. However, the success of the proposed DTC strategy has demonstrated that novel variation harbored by SHWs can be accessed in a straightforward, effective manner. The strategy is in principle generalizable to any allopolyploid crop species where the identity of the progenitor species is known."

This study aimed to investigate the effects of low-dose and high-dose decoctions of Fructus aurantii in a rat model of functional dyspepsia (FD). MATERIAL AND METHODS Sprague-Dawley rats (n=90) were divided into nine study groups: the control group, the FD model group, the domperidone-treated (Domp) group, the low-dose raw Fructus aurantii (FA-L) group, the high-dose raw Fructus aurantii (FA-H) group, the low-dose Fructus aurantii with stir-fried wheat bran (Bran-L) group, the high-dose Fructus aurantii with stir-fried wheat bran (Bran-H) group, the low-dose Fructus aurantii with stir-fried wheat bran and honey (Honey-L) group, and the high-dose Fructus aurantii with stir-fried wheat bran and honey (Honey-H) group. The FD rat model was established by semi-starvation, followed by tail damping, stimulation, and forced exercise with fatigue. Change in weight, rate of gastric emptying and intestinal propulsion, and serum levels of leptin, motilin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), gastrin, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), ghrelin, and cholecystokinin were compared between the groups. RESULTS In the FD model group, weight, rate of gastric emptying and intestinal propulsion significantly decreased, the expression of leptin, VIP and CGRP increased, and expression of motilin, gastrin, ghrelin, and cholecystokinin significantly decreased. Treatment with low-dose Fructus aurantii with stir-fried wheat bran significantly reversed these effects.

"32477413","abstracttext","Wheat powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ) is a devastating disease that threatens wheat production and yield worldwide. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21 , originating from wheat wild relative Dasypyrum villosum , encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site, leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) protein and confers broad-spectrum resistance to wheat powdery mildew. In the present study, we isolated 73 Pm21 alleles from different powdery mildew-resistant D. villosum accessions, among which, 38 alleles were non-redundant. Sequence analysis identified seven minor insertion-deletion (InDel) polymorphisms and 400 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the 38 non-redundant Pm21 alleles. The nucleotide diversity of the LRR domain was significantly higher than those of the CC and NB-ARC domains. Further evolutionary analysis indicated that the solvent-exposed LRR residues of Pm21 alleles had undergone diversifying selection (dN/dS = 3.19734). In addition, eight LRR motifs and four amino acid sites in the LRR domain were also experienced positive selection, indicating that these motifs and sites play critical roles in resistance specificity. The phylogenetic tree showed that 38 Pm21 alleles were divided into seven classes. Classes A (including original Pm21 ), B and C were the major classes, including 26 alleles (68.4%). We also identified three non-functional Pm21 alleles from four susceptible homozygous D. villosum lines (DvSus-1 to DvSus-4) and two susceptible wheat- D. villosum chromosome addition lines (DA6V#1 and DA6V#3). The genetic variations of non-functional Pm21 alleles involved point mutation, deletion and insertion, respectively. The results also showed that the non-functional Pm21 alleles in the two chromosome addition lines both came from the susceptible donors of D. villosum . This study gives a new insight into the evolutionary characteristics of Pm21 alleles and discusses how to sustainably utilize Pm21 in wheat production. This study also reveals the sequence variants and origins of non-functional Pm21 alleles in D. villosum populations."

"32547594","abstracttext","Globally, two billion people suffer from micronutrient deficiencies. Cereal grains provide more than 50% of the daily requirement of calories in human diets, but they often fail to provide adequate essential minerals and vitamins. Cereal crop production in developing countries achieved remarkable yield gains through the efforts of the Green Revolution (117% in rice, 30% in wheat, 530% in maize, and 188% in pearl millet). However, modern varieties are often deficient in essential micronutrients compared to traditional varieties and land races. Breeding for nutritional quality in staple cereals is a challenging task; however, biofortification initiatives combined with genomic tools increase the feasibility. Current biofortification breeding activities include improving rice (for zinc), wheat (for zinc), maize (for provitamin A), and pearl millet (for iron and zinc). Biofortification is a sustainable approach to enrich staple cereals with provitamin A, carotenoids, and folates. Significant genetic variation has been found for provitamin A (96-850 μg and 12-1780 μg in 100 g in wheat and maize, respectively), carotenoids (558-6730 μg in maize), and folates in rice (11-51 μg) and wheat (32.3-89.1 μg) in 100 g. This indicates the prospects for biofortification breeding. Several QTLs associated with carotenoids and folates have been identified in major cereals, and the most promising of these are presented here. Breeding for essential nutrition should be a core objective of next-generation crop breeding. This review synthesizes the available literature on folates, provitamin A, and carotenoids in rice, wheat, maize, and pearl millet, including genetic variation, trait discovery, QTL identification, gene introgressions, and the strategy of genomics-assisted biofortification for these traits. Recent evidence shows that genomics-assisted breeding for grain nutrition in rice, wheat, maize, and pearl millet crops have good potential to aid in the alleviation of micronutrient malnutrition in many developing countries."

In total, 5,639 proteins and 1,301 acetylated sites on 722 proteins were identified at 0, 12 and 24 h after imbibitions. Several particularly preferred amino acids were found near acetylation sites, including K ac S, K ac T, K ac K, K ac R, K ac H, K ac F, K ac N, K ac *E, FK ac and K ac *D, in the embryos during seed germination. Among them, K ac H, K ac F, FK ac and K ac K were conserved in wheat. Biosynthetic process, transcriptional regulation, ribosome and proteasome pathway related proteins were significantly enriched in both differentially expressed proteins and differentially acetylated proteins through Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis. We also revealed that histone acetylation was differentially involved in epigenetic regulation during seed germination. Meanwhile, abscisic acid and stress related proteins were found with acetylation changes. In addition, we focused on 8 enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism, and found they were differentially acetylated during seed germination. Finally, a putative metabolic pathway was proposed to dissect the roles of protein acetylation during wheat seed germination. These results not only demonstrate that lysine acetylation may play key roles in seed germination of wheat but also reveal insights into the molecular mechanism of seed germination in this crop."

"30123234","abstracttext","Flour color-related traits, including brightness (L * ), redness (a * ), yellowness (b * ) and yellow pigment content (YPC), are very important for end-use quality of wheat. Uncovering the genetic architecture of these traits is necessary for improving wheat quality by marker-assisted selection (MAS). In the present study, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed on a collection of 166 bread wheat cultivars to better understand the genetic architecture of flour color-related traits using the wheat 90 and 660 K SNP arrays, and 10 allele-specific markers for known genes influencing these traits. Fifteen, 28, 25, and 32 marker-trait associations (MTAs) for L * , a * , b * , and YPC, respectively, were detected, explaining 6.5-20.9% phenotypic variation. Seventy-eight loci were consistent across all four environments. Compared with previous studies, Psy-A1, Psy-B1, Pinb-D1 , and the 1B•1R translocation controlling flour color-related traits were confirmed, and four loci were novel. Two and 11 loci explained much more phenotypic variation of a * and YPC than phytoene synthase 1 gene ( Psy1 ), respectively. Sixteen candidate genes were predicted based on biochemical information and bioinformatics analyses, mainly related to carotenoid biosynthesis and degradation, terpenoid backbone biosynthesis and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis. The results largely enrich our knowledge of the genetic basis of flour color-related traits in bread wheat and provide valuable markers for wheat quality improvement. The study also indicated that GWAS was a powerful strategy for dissecting flour color-related traits and identifying candidate genes based on diverse genotypes and high-throughput SNP arrays."

"30544665","abstracttext","In plants, the HAK (high-affinity K⁺)/KUP (K⁺ uptake)/KT (K⁺ transporter) family represents a large group of potassium transporters that play important roles in plant growth and environmental adaptation. Although HAK/KUP/KT genes have been extensively investigated in many plant species, they remain uncharacterized in wheat, especially those involved in the response to environmental stresses. In this study, 56 wheat HAK/KUP/KT (hereafter called TaHAK s) genes were identified by a genome-wide search using recently released wheat genomic data. Phylogenetic analysis grouped these genes into four clusters (Ι, II, III, IV), containing 22, 19, 7 and 8 genes, respectively. Chromosomal distribution, gene structure, and conserved motif analyses of the 56 TaHAK genes were subsequently performed. In silico RNA-seq data analysis revealed that TaHAK s from clusters II and III are constitutively expressed in various wheat tissues, while most genes from clusters I and IV have very low expression levels in the examined tissues at different developmental stages. qRT-PCR analysis showed that expression levels of TaHAK genes in wheat seedlings were significantly up- or downregulated when seedlings were exposed to K⁺ deficiency, high salinity, or dehydration. Furthermore, we functionally characterized TaHAK1b-2BL and showed that it facilitates K⁺ transport in yeast. Collectively, these results provide valuable information for further functional studies of TaHAKs , and contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of wheat development and stress tolerance."

"30506523","abstracttext_key message","Genomic selection had a higher selection response for FHB resistance than phenotypic selection, while association mapping identified major QTL on chromosome 3B unaffected by plant height and flowering date. Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most destructive diseases of durum wheat. Hence, minimizing losses in yield, quality and avoiding contamination with mycotoxins are of pivotal importance, as durum wheat is mostly used for human consumption. While growing resistant varieties is the most promising approach for controlling this fungal disease, FHB resistance breeding in durum wheat is hampered by the limited variation in the elite gene pool and difficulties in efficiently combining the numerous small-effect resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) in the same line. We evaluated an international collection of 228 genotyped durum wheat cultivars for FHB resistance over 3 years to investigate the genetic architecture and potential of genomic-assisted breeding for FHB resistance in durum wheat. Plant height was strongly positively correlated with FHB resistance and led to co-localization of plant height and resistance QTL. Nevertheless, a major QTL on chromosome 3B independent of plant height was identified in the same chromosomal interval as reported for the prominent hexaploid resistance QTL Fhb1, though haplotype analysis highlighted the distinctiveness of both QTL. Comparison between phenotypic and genomic selection for FHB resistance revealed a superior prediction ability of the former. However, simulated selection experiments resulted in higher selection responses when using genomic breeding values for early generation selection. An earlier identification of the most promising lines and crossing parents was feasible with a genomic selection index, which suggested a much faster short-term population improvement than previously possible in durum wheat, complementing long-term strategies with exotic resistance donors."

WD40 proteins participate in various cellular processes, such as histone modification, transcription regulation, and signal transduction. WD40 proteins are regarded as crucial regulators of plant development processes. However, the systematic identification and analysis of WD40 proteins have yet to be reported in wheat."
"30400808","abstracttext_results","In this study, a total of 743 WD40 proteins were identified in wheat, and they were grouped into 5 clusters and 11 subfamilies.

TaWD40s showed the specific characteristics at the reproductive developmental stage, and numerous TaWD40s were involved in responses to stresses, including cold, heat, drought, and powdery mildew infection pathogen, based on the result of RNA-seq data analysis. The expression profiles of some TaWD40s in wheat seed development were confirmed through qRT-PCR technique."
"30400808","abstracttext_conclusion","In this study, 743 TaWD40s were identified from the wheat genome. As the main driving force of evolution, duplication events were observed, and homologous recombination was another driving force of evolution.

"30218294","abstracttext","Heading date is one of the most important traits in wheat breeding as it affects adaptation and yield potential. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the 90 K iSelect SNP genotyping assay indicated that a total of 306 loci were significantly associated with heading and flowering dates in 13 environments in Chinese common wheat from the Yellow and Huai wheat region. Of these, 105 loci were significantly correlated with both heading and flowering dates and were found in clusters on chromosomes 2, 5, 6, and 7. Based on differences in distribution of the vernalization and photoperiod genes among chromosomes, arms, or block regions, 13 novel, environmentally stable genetic loci were associated with heading and flowering dates, including RAC875_c41145_189 on 1DS, RAC875_c50422_299 on 2BL, and RAC875_c48703_148 on 2DS, that accounted for more than 20% phenotypic variance explained (PVE) of the heading/flowering date in at least four environments. GWAS and t test of a combination of SNPs and vernalization and photoperiod alleles indicated that the Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, and Ppd-D1 genes significantly affect heading and flowering dates in Chinese common wheat. Based on the association of heading and flowering dates with the vernalization and photoperiod alleles at seven loci and three significant SNPs, optimal linear regression equations were established, which show that of the seven loci, the Ppd-D1 gene plays the most important role in modulating heading and flowering dates in Chinese wheat, followed by Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1. Additionally, three novel genetic loci (RAC875_c41145_189, Excalibur_c60164_137, and RAC875_c50422_299) also show important effect on heading and flowering dates. Therefore, Ppd-D1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, and the novel genetic loci should be further investigated in terms of improving heading and flowering dates in Chinese wheat. Further quantitative analysis of an F 10 recombinant inbred lines population identified a major QTL that controls heading and flowering dates within the Ppd-D1 locus with PVEs of 28.4% and 34.0%, respectively; this QTL was also significantly associated with spike length, peduncle length, fertile spikelets number, cold resistance, and tiller number."

"30804024","abstracttext","Improving the end-use quality traits is one of the primary objectives in wheat breeding programs. In the current study, a population of 127 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Glenn (PI-639273) and Traverse (PI-642780) was developed and used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for 16 end-use quality traits in wheat. The phenotyping of these 16 traits was performed in nine environments in North Dakota, USA. The genotyping for the RIL population was conducted using the wheat Illumina iSelect 90K SNP assay. A high-density genetic linkage map consisting of 7,963 SNP markers identified a total of 76 additive QTL (A-QTL) and 73 digenic epistatic QTL (DE-QTL) associated with these traits. Overall, 12 stable major A-QTL and three stable DE-QTL were identified for these traits, suggesting that both A-QTL and DE-QTL played an important role in controlling end-use quality traits in wheat. The most significant A-QTL ( AQ.MMLPT.ndsu.1B ) was detected on chromosome 1B for mixograph middle line peak time. The AQ.MMLPT.ndsu.1B A-QTL was located very close to the position of the Glu-B1 gene encoding for a subunit of high molecular weight glutenin and explained up to 24.43% of phenotypic variation for mixograph MID line peak time. A total of 23 co-localized QTL loci were detected, suggesting the possibility of the simultaneous improvement of the end-use quality traits through selection procedures in wheat breeding programs. Overall, the information provided in this study could be used in marker-assisted selection to increase selection efficiency and to improve the end-use quality in wheat."

"30327845","abstracttext_key message","GWAS detected 11 yellow spot resistance QTL in the Vavilov wheat collection. Promising adult-plant resistance loci could provide a sustainable genetic solution to yellow spot in modern wheat varieties. Yellow spot, caused by the fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), is the most economically damaging foliar disease of wheat in Australia. Genetic resistance is considered to be the most sustainable means for disease management, yet the genomic regions underpinning resistance to Ptr, particularly adult-plant resistance (APR), remain vastly unknown. In this study, we report results of a genome-wide association study using 295 accessions from the Vavilov wheat collection which were extensively tested for response to Ptr infections in glasshouse and field trials at both seedling an adult growth stages. Combining phenotypic datasets from multiple experiments in Australia and Russia with 25,286 genome-wide, high-quality DArTseq markers, we detected a total of 11 QTL, of which 5 were associated with seedling resistance, 3 with all-stage resistance, and 3 with APR. Interestingly, the novel APR QTL were effective even in the presence of host sensitivity gene Tsn1. These genomic regions could offer broad-spectrum yellow spot protection, not just to ToxA but also other pathogenicity or virulence factors. Vavilov wheat accessions carrying APR QTL combinations displayed enhanced levels of resistance highlighting the potential for QTL stacking through breeding. We propose that the APR genetic factors discovered in our study could be used to improve resistance levels in modern wheat varieties and contribute to the sustainable control of yellow spot."

"30327846","abstracttext_key message","A novel QTL for FHB resistance was mapped on wheat 7DL, being effective in multiple genetic backgrounds and environments, and comparable to Fhb1 in effect magnitude. Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the major fungal diseases affecting wheat production in many countries. The wheat line AQ24788-83 (AQ) possesses FHB resistance. The American wheat cultivar Luke is FHB susceptible. A Luke × AQ population consisting of 1652 advanced recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed, from which 272 RILs were randomly sampled and used to construct a linkage map. Another 154 RILs were selected for homogeneity in plant height (PH) and flowering date (FD). This selection strategy was adopted to reduce possible confounding effects on FHB assessment due to variation in PH and FD. The 272 and 154 RILs were genotyped applying simple sequence repeat (SSR), diversity arrays technology (DArT) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. The two sets of RILs were evaluated for FHB resistance applying point inoculation in greenhouses; the 154 RILs were also evaluated applying spray inoculation in multiple field environments. The linkage map consisted of 2088 SSR, DArT, and SNP markers. A FHB resistance quantitative trait locus (QTL), designated as QFhb.cau-7DL, was detected on chromosome arm 7DL; this QTL was closely linked to the SSR marker gwm428 ( http://www.wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SSR/ ). QFhb.cau-7DL was significantly effective (α = 0.01) in every test trial, and its effectiveness was validated using three additional wheat crosses. Sumai 3 (donor wheat of the FHB resistance gene Fhb1) was used in one of these crosses. QFhb.cau-7DL was comparable to Fhb1 in effect magnitude, providing a great potential for improving FHB resistance."

These microorganisms were inoculated, alone or in combination, in durum wheat (cultivars Odisseo and Saragolla). Non-inoculated plants of each cultivar represented the controls. Forty-three days after sowing, roots were deprived of the epiphytic microbiota and subjected to DNA extraction. The DNA was used as template in PCR-DGGE analysis of the 16S rRNA gene (variable region V3-V5) and 16S (region V1-V3) metagenetics. Odisseo and Saragolla root endophytic bacterial biotas differed for number of OTUs and composition. In detail, Pseudomonas was higher in Odisseo than in Saragolla. The inoculation of F. mosseae and L. plantarum increased the abundance of Pseudomonas , some Actinobacteria (e.g., Streptomyces , Microbacterium , two genera including several plant growth promoting (PGP) strains) and Bacteroidetes in both cultivars. However, the endophytic bacterial biota of Saragolla roots inoculated just with lactobacilli did not differ from that of the control. The inoculation of Saragolla with F. mosseae , alone or in combination with lactobacilli, led to higher abundance of Rhodococcus , belonging to Actinobacteria and encompassing PGP strains. First, this work showed that F. mosseae and L. plantarum shape the endophytic bacterial biota of durum wheat roots. Abundance of some OTUs was affected by the microbial inoculation, depending on the cultivar. This result represents a starting point for exploitation of beneficial endophytes of wheat roots."

Nevertheless, the mechanisms associated with an improved plant biomass and soil microbiome in low metal-contaminated soils are still unclear. In this study, the influence of biochar on soil physico-chemical properties, plant performance, and rhizosphere microbiota in durum wheat was investigated at the above- and belowground levels. Two kinds of biochar from different feedstocks (wood chips and wheat straw pellets) and two Italian durum wheat varieties, Duilio and Marco Aurelio, were analyzed in a greenhouse using a low-nutrient gleyic fluvisol containing a very small amount of Pb and Zn. Four different treatments were performed: soil-only control (C), soil amended with woody biochar equilibrated with nutrient solution (B1+) and non-activated (B1-), and soil amended with non-activated (B2-) wheat straw biochar. Seven weeks after seed germination, (1) the physico-chemical properties of soil, biochars, and mixtures were assessed; (2) the fresh and dry weight of aboveground plant tissues and roots and other morphometric traits were measured; and (3) metabarcoding of the 16S rRNA bacterial gene was performed on rhizosphere soil samples. The results showed that the biochar from wheat straw had stronger impact on both durum varieties, with higher electrical conductivity, higher levels of available K and Na, and a substantial increase of dissolved Na+, K+, and Cl- ions in pore water. Generally, biochar amendment decreased Zn availability for the plants. In addition, biochar improved plant growth in the early growth stage, and the more positive effect was achieved by combining wheat straw biochar with Marco Aurelio. Rhizosphere bacterial microbiota showed variation in alpha diversity only due to treatment; on the other hand, the differential analysis showed consistent variation among samples with significant effects on amplicon sequence variant (ASV) abundance due to the specific biochar treatment as well as the genotype. The pure B1-, due to its scarce nutrient content with respect to the richer types (B1+ and B2-), had a negative impact on microbiota richness. Our study highlights that an appropriate combination of biochar feedstock and crop species may lead to superior yield."

"31532783","abstracttext","The genetic gain in yield and quality are two major targets of wheat breeding programs around the world. In this study, a high density genetic map consisting of 10,172 SNP markers identified a total of 43 genomic regions associated with three quality traits, three yield traits and two agronomic traits in hard red spring wheat (HRSW). When compared with six grain shape and size traits, the quality traits showed mostly independent genetic control (~18% common loci), while the yield traits showed moderate association (~53% common loci). Association of genomic regions for grain area (GA) and thousand-grain weight (TGW), with yield suggests that targeting an increase in GA may help enhancing wheat yield through an increase in TGW. Flour extraction (FE), although has a weak positive phenotypic association with grain shape and size, they do not share any common genetic loci. A major contributor to plant height was the Rht8 locus and the reduced height allele was associated with significant increase in grains per spike (GPS) and FE, and decrease in number of spikes per square meter and test weight. Stable loci were identified for almost all the traits. However, we could not find any QTL in the region of major known genes like GPC-B1, Ha, Rht-1, and Ppd-1. Epistasis also played an important role in the genetics of majority of the traits. In addition to enhancing our knowledge about the association of wheat quality and yield with grain shape and size, this study provides novel loci, genetic information and pre-breeding material (combining positive alleles from both parents) to enhance the cultivated gene pool in wheat germplasm. These resources are valuable in facilitating molecular breeding for wheat quality and yield improvement."

"31581639","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ( Pgt ) had been a devastating foliar disease worldwide during the 20th century. With the emergence of Ug99 races, which are virulent to most stem rust resistance genes deployed in wheat varieties and advanced lines, stem rust has once again become a disease threatening global wheat production. Sr52 , derived from Dasypyrum villosum and mapped to the long arm of 6V#3, is one of the few effective genes against Ug99 races. In this study, the wheat- D . villosum Robertsonian translocation T6AS·6V#3L, the only stock carrying Sr52 released to experimental and breeding programs so far, was crossed with a CS ph1b mutant to induce recombinants with shortened 6V#3L chromosome segments locating Sr52 . Six independent homozygous recombinants with different segment sizes and breakpoints were developed and characterized using in situ hybridization and molecular markers analyses. Stem rust resistance evaluation showed that only three terminal recombinants (1381, 1380, and 1392) containing 8%, 22%, and 30% of the distal segment of 6V#3L, respectively, were resistant to stem rust. Thus, the gene Sr52 was mapped into 6V#3L bin FL 0.92-1.00. In addition, three molecular markers in the Sr52 -located interval of 6V#3L were confirmed to be diagnostic markers for selection of Sr52 introgressed into common wheat. The newly developed small segment translocation lines with Sr52 and the identified molecular markers closely linked to Sr52 will be valuable for wheat disease breeding."

A total of 86 MQTL were identified as responsible for yield, of which 34 were for irrigated environments, 39 for drought-stressed environments, 36 for heat-stressed environments, and 23 for both drought- and heat-stressed environments. The high-confidence genes within the physical positions of the MQTL flanking markers were screened in the reference genome RefSeq V1.0, which identified 210 putative candidate genes. The phenotypic data for 14 contrasting genotypes with either high or low yield performance-according to the Australian National Variety Trials-were associated with their genotypic data obtained through ddRAD sequencing, which validated 18 genes or gene clusters associated with MQTL that had important roles for wheat yield. The detected and refined MQTL and candidate genes will be useful for marker-assisted selection of high yield in wheat breeding."

"32938380","abstracttext_background","Bread wheat is one of the most important crops for the human diet, but the increasing soil salinization is causing yield reductions worldwide. Improving salt stress tolerance in wheat requires the elucidation of the mechanistic basis of plant response to this abiotic stress factor. Although several studies have been performed to analyze wheat adaptation to salt stress, there are still some gaps to fully understand the molecular mechanisms from initial signal perception to the onset of responsive tolerance pathways. The main objective of this study is to exploit the dynamic salt stress transcriptome in underlying QTL regions to uncover candidate genes controlling salt stress tolerance in bread wheat. The massive analysis of 3'-ends sequencing protocol was used to analyze leave samples at osmotic and ionic phases. Afterward, stress-responsive genes overlapping QTL for salt stress-related traits in two mapping populations were identified."
"32938380","abstracttext_results","Among the over-represented salt-responsive gene categories, the early up-regulation of calcium-binding and cell wall synthesis genes found in the tolerant genotype are presumably strategies to cope with the salt-related osmotic stress. On the other hand, the down-regulation of photosynthesis-related and calcium-binding genes, and the increased oxidative stress response in the susceptible genotype are linked with the greater photosynthesis inhibition at the osmotic phase. The specific up-regulation of some ABC transporters and Na + /Ca 2+ exchangers in the tolerant genotype at the ionic stage indicates their involvement in mechanisms of sodium exclusion and homeostasis. Moreover, genes related to protein synthesis and breakdown were identified at both stress phases. Based on the linkage disequilibrium blocks, salt-responsive genes within QTL intervals were identified as potential components operating in pathways leading to salt stress tolerance. Furthermore, this study conferred evidence of novel regions with transcription in bread wheat."
"32938380","abstracttext_conclusion","The dynamic transcriptome analysis allowed the comparison of osmotic and ionic phases of the salt stress response and gave insights into key molecular mechanisms involved in the salt stress adaptation of contrasting bread wheat genotypes. The leveraging of the highly contiguous chromosome-level reference genome sequence assembly facilitated the QTL dissection by targeting novel candidate genes for salt tolerance."

"33118856","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is the causal agent of wheat stripe rust that causes severe yield losses all over the world. As a macrocyclic heteroecious rust fungus, it is able to infect two unrelated host plants: wheat and barberry. Its urediniospores infect wheat and cause disease epidemic, while its basidiospores parasitize barberry to fulfill the sexual reproduction. This complex life cycle poses interesting questions on the different mechanisms of pathogenesis underlying the infection of the two different hosts. In the present study, transcriptomes of Pst during the initial infection of wheat and barberry leaves were qualitatively and quantitatively compared. As a result, 142 wheat-specific expressed genes (WEGs) were identified, which was far less than 2,677 barberry-specifically expressed genes (BEGs). A larger proportion of evolutionary conserved genes were observed in BEGs than that in WEGs, implying a longer history of the interaction between Pst and barberry. Additionally, Pst differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between wheat at 1 dpi/2 dpi and barberry at 3 dpi/ 4dpi were identified by quantitative analysis. Gene Ontology analysis of these DEGs and expression patterns of Pst pathogenic genes, including those encoding candidate secreted effectors, cell wall degrading enzymes, and nutrient transporters, demonstrated that urediniospores and basidiospores exploited distinct strategies to overcome host defense systems. These results represent the first analysis of the Pst transcriptome in barberry and contribute to a better understanding of the evolutionary processes and strategies of different types of rust spores during the infection process on different hosts."

"32658889","abstracttext","Thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs), which are defined as pathogenesis-related protein family 5 (PR5) members, are common plant proteins involved in defense responses and confer antifungal activity against many plant pathogens. Our earlier studies have reported that the TaTLP1 gene was isolated from wheat and proved to be involved in wheat defense in response to leaf rust attack. The present study aims to identify the interacting proteins of TaTLP1 and characterize the role of the interaction between wheat and Puccinia triticina (Pt). Pull-down experiments designed to isolate the molecular target of TaTLP1 in tobacco resulted in the identification of TaPR1, a pathogenesis-related protein of family 1, and the interaction between TaTLP1 and TaPR1 was confirmed by yeast two-hybrid experiments (Y2H), bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC), and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP). In vitro, TaTLP1 and TaPR1 together increased antifungal activity against Pt. In vivo, the disease resistance phenotype, histological observations of fungal growth and host responses, and accumulation of H2O2 in TaTLP1-TaPR1 in co-silenced plants indicated that co-silencing significantly enhanced wheat susceptibility compared to single knockdown TaTLP1 or TaPR1 plants. The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was significantly reduced in co-silenced plants compared to controls during Pt infection, which suggested that the TaTLP1-TaPR1 interaction positively modulates wheat resistance to Pt in an ROS-dependent manner. Our findings provide new insights for understanding the roles of two different PRs, TaTLP1 and TaPR1, in wheat resistance to leaf rust."

"32689900","abstracttext","Parastagonospora nodorum is an important fungal pathogen that causes Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB) in wheat. This pathogen produces several necrotrophic effectors that act as virulence factors; three have been cloned, SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3. In this study, P. nodorum and its sister species P. avenaria f. tritici ( Pat1 ) were isolated from wheat node and grain samples collected from distanced sites in western Canada during 2018. The presence of effector genes and associated haplotypes were determined by PCR and sequence analysis. An internal transcribed spacer-restriction fragment length polymorphism test was developed to distinguish between leaf spotting pathogens ( P. nodorum , Pat1 , Pyrenophora tritici-repentis , and Bipolaris sorokiniana ). P. nodorum was mainly recovered from wheat nodes and to a lesser extent from the grains, while Pat1 was exclusively isolated from grain samples. The effector genes were present in almost all P. nodorum isolates, with the ToxA haplotype 5 (H5) being most prevalent, while a novel ToxA haplotype (denoted here H21) is reported for the first time. In Pat1 , only combinations of SnTox1 and SnTox3 genes were present. A ToxA haplotype network was also constructed to assess the evolutionary relationship among globally found haplotypes to date. Finally, cultivars representing wheat development in Canada for the last century were tested for sensitivity to Sn-effectors and to the presence of Tsn1 , the ToxA sensitivity gene. Of tested cultivars, 32.9 and 56.9% were sensitive to SnTox1 and SnTox3, respectively, and Tsn1 was present in 59% of the cultivars. In conclusion, P. nodorum and Pat1 were prevalent wheat pathogens in Canada with a potential tissue-specific colonization capacity, while producing necrotrophic effectors to which wheat is sensitive."

"11999851","abstracttext","We have applied a two-gene system based on the sequences of nuclear genes encoding multi-domain plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and plastid 3-phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) to study grass evolution. Our analysis revealed that these genes are single-copy in most of the grass species studied, allowing the establishment of orthologous relationships between them. These relationships are consistent with the known facts of their evolution: the eukaryotic origin of the plastid ACCase, created by duplication of a gene encoding the cytosolic multi-domain ACCase gene early in grass evolution, and the prokaryotic (endosymbiont) origin of the plastid PGK. The major phylogenetic relationships among grasses deduced from the nucleotide sequence comparisons of ACCase and PGK genes are consistent with each other and with the milestones of grass evolution revealed by other methods. Nucleotide substitution rates were calculated based on multiple pairwise sequence comparisons. On a relative basis, with the divergence of the Pooideae and Panicoideae subfamilies set at 60 million years ago (MYA), events leading to the Triticum/Aegilops complex occurred at the following intervals: divergence of Lolium (Lolium rigidum) at 35 MYA, divergence of Hordeum (Hordeum vulgare) at 11 MYA and divergence of Secale (Secale cereale) at 7 MYA. On the same scale, gene duplication leading to the multi-domain plastid ACCase in grasses occurred at 129 MYA, divergence of grass and dicot plastid PGK genes at 137 MYA, and divergence of grass and dicot cytosolic PGK genes at 155 MYA. The ACCase and PGK genes provide a well-understood two-locus system to study grass phylogeny, evolution and systematics."

"18976483","abstracttext_background","Barley has one of the largest and most complex genomes of all economically important food crops. The rise of new short read sequencing technologies such as Illumina/Solexa permits such large genomes to be effectively sampled at relatively low cost. Based on the corresponding sequence reads a Mathematically Defined Repeat (MDR) index can be generated to map repetitive regions in genomic sequences."
"18976483","abstracttext_results","We have generated 574 Mbp of Illumina/Solexa sequences from barley total genomic DNA, representing about 10% of a genome equivalent. From these sequences we generated an MDR index which was then used to identify and mark repetitive regions in the barley genome. Comparison of the MDR plots with expert repeat annotation drawing on the information already available for known repetitive elements revealed a significant correspondence between the two methods. MDR-based annotation allowed for the identification of dozens of novel repeat sequences, though, which were not recognised by hand-annotation. The MDR data was also used to identify gene-containing regions by masking of repetitive sequences in eight de-novo sequenced bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. For half of the identified candidate gene islands indeed gene sequences could be identified. MDR data were only of limited use, when mapped on genomic sequences from the closely related species Triticum monococcum as only a fraction of the repetitive sequences was recognised."
"18976483","abstracttext_conclusion","An MDR index for barley, which was obtained by whole-genome Illumina/Solexa sequencing, proved as efficient in repeat identification as manual expert annotation. Circumventing the labour-intensive step of producing a specific repeat library for expert annotation, an MDR index provides an elegant and efficient resource for the identification of repetitive and low-copy (i.e. potentially gene-containing sequences) regions in uncharacterised genomic sequences. The restriction that a particular MDR index can not be used across species is outweighed by the low costs of Illumina/Solexa sequencing which makes any chosen genome accessible for whole-genome sequence sampling."

"30352590","abstracttext_background","Domesticated einkorn (Triticum monococcum L.) is one of the oldest cultivated cereal crops in the world. Its small genome size (~ 5.7 GB), low ploidy (2n = 2x = 14, A m A m ) and high genetic polymorphism make this species very attractive for use as a diploid model for understanding the genomics and proteomics of Triticeae. Einkorn, however, is still a recalcitrant monocotyledonous species for the application of modern biotechnologies, including transgenesis. This paper reports the factors that may influence transgene delivery, integration, expression and inheritance in einkorn."
"30352590","abstracttext_results","In this study, we report the successful genetic transformation of einkorn using biolistic-mediated DNA delivery. Immature embryo-derived tissues of spring einkorn were bombarded with a plasmid containing the reporter gene GFP (green fluorescent protein) driven by the rice actin promoter (act1) and the selectable bar gene (bialaphos resistance gene) driven by the maize ubiquitin promoter (ubi1). Adjustments to various parameters such as gas pressure, microcarrier size and developmental stage of target tissue were essential for successful transient and stable transformation. Bombarded einkorn tissues are recalcitrant to regenerating plants, but certain modifications of the culture medium have been shown to increase the production of transgenic events. In various experiments, independent transgenic plants were produced at frequencies ranging from 0.0 to 0.6%. Molecular analysis, marker gene expression and herbicide treatment demonstrated that gfp/bar genes were stably integrated into the einkorn genome and successfully inherited over several generations. The transgenes, as dominant loci, segregated in both Mendelian and non-Mendelian fashion due to multiple insertions. Fertile homozygous T 1 -T 2 populations of transgenic einkorn that are resistant to herbicides were selected."
"30352590","abstracttext_conclusion","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the production of genetically modified einkorn plants.

"2552325","articletitle","RNA editing in wheat mitochondria results in the conservation of protein sequences."
"2552325","abstracttext","RNA editing is a process that results in the production of a messenger RNA with nucleotide sequences that differ from those of the template DNA, and provides another mechanism for modulating gene expression. The phenomenon was initially described in the mitochondria of protozoa. Here we report that RNA editing is also required for the correct expression of plant mitochondrial genes. It has previously been proposed that in plant mitochondria there is a departure from the universal genetic code, with CGG specifying tryptophan instead of arginine. This was because CGG codons are often found in plant mitochondrial genes at positions corresponding to those encoding conserved tryptophans in other organisms. We have now found, however, wheat mitochondrial gene sequences containing C residues that are edited to U residues in the corresponding mRNA sequences. In this way, CGG codons can be changed to UGG codons in the mRNA so that tryptophan may be encoded according to the universal genetic code. Furthermore, for each codon modification resulting from a C----U conversion that we studied, we found a corresponding change in the amino acid that was encoded. RNA editing in wheat mitochondria can thus maintain genetic information at the RNA level and as a result contribute to the conservation of mitochondrial protein sequences among plants."

"1421148","abstracttext","A 14.5 kDa barley endosperm protein that is a major allergen in baker's asthma disease, as previously shown by both in vitro (IgE binding) and in vivo tests, has been identified as a glycosylated monomeric member of the multigene family of inhibitors of alpha-amylase/trypsin from cereals. A cDNA encoding this allergen (renamed BMAI-1) has been isolated and characterized. The deduced sequence for the mature protein, which is 132 residues long, is identical in its N-terminal end to the 20 amino acid partial sequence previously determined from the purified allergen, and fully confirms that it is a member of the multigene family of cereal inhibitors. Southern-blot analysis of wheat/barley addition lines using the insert in the BMAI-1 cDNA clone as a probe, has led to the location of the allergen gene (Iam1) in barley chromosome 2, while another related member of this protein family, the barley dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor BDAI-1 gene (Iad1) has been located in chromosome 6. Iam1 is the first member of this inhibitor family in cereals to be assigned to chromosome group 2, thus extending the dispersion of genes in the family to five out of the seven homology groups of chromosomes in wheat and barley (chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7)."
"1831056","articletitle","CpG methylation inhibits binding of several sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins from pea, wheat, soybean and cauliflower."
"1831056","abstracttext","To elucidate how methylation of specific sites in plant DNA might control transcription, we examined the effect of DNA methylation at CpG sequences on the binding of plant nuclear factors to an oligonucleotide duplex containing the consensus sequence for mammalian CREB (cAMP response element binding protein). CREB is part of the ATF (activating transcription factor) family of mammalian proteins specifically binding to 5'-TGACGTCA-3' and related sequences. Proteins recognizing the CREB-specific ligand were identified in nuclear extracts of pea seeds, wheat germ, cauliflower, and soybean leaves using electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Cytosine methylation inhibited binding of this protein in all these extracts, and so this sequence-specific DNA-binding activity is referred to as methylation-inhibited binding protein 1 (MIB-1). Sites somewhat similar to that of the CREB ligand are found in the upstream regions of a wheat histone H3 gene and tomato and pea ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase genes. These sites were bound preferentially by distinct proteins that may be related to the previously described plant proteins HBP-1, HSBF, ASF-1, or GBF. Methylation of cytosine residues at these sites and at a site for MIB-1 located upstream of a soybean proline-rich protein gene also reduced specific binding with all the nuclear extracts tested. Similarly, substitution of the central CpG dinucleotide with TpG decreased binding."
"8492809","articletitle","Two different Em-like genes are expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds during maturation."
"8492809","abstracttext","Using a radish cDNA probe, we have isolated and characterized two genomic clones from Arabidopsis thaliana (GEA1 and GEA6) encoding two different proteins that are homologous to the ""Early methionine-labelled"" (Em) protein of wheat. GEA1 differs from GEA6 and Em clones of wheat in that a sequence coding for 20 amino acid residues is tandemly repeated 4 times. These two genomic clones correspond to two genes named AtEm1 and AtEm6. Sequencing of several cDNA clones showed that both genes are expressed. The transcription start site was determined for both genes by RNase mapping. The site of polyadenylation is variable and there is no obvious consensus sequence for polyadenylation at the 3' ends of the genes. mRNA corresponding to GEA6 is present only in nearly dry and dry seeds, whereas the corresponding to GEA1 appears in immature seeds and is maximum in dry seeds. No expression of either gene could be detected in leaf, stem, or floral buds. Expression of both genes could be detected in immature seeds when the siliques were incubated with abscisic acid (ABA), demonstrating that both genes are ABA responsive. However, examination of the 5' upstream region does not reveal any extensive homology, suggesting that regulation of the two genes differs. In situ hybridization with a GEA1 probe demonstrated that the expression of this gene is essentially located in the provascular tissues of the cotyledons and axis of the dry seed as well as in the epiderm and outer layers of the cortex in the embryo axis."

"9027506","abstracttext","A novel mammalian gene, Eif4g2, with a high degree of homology to the p82 subunit of the wheat germ eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF-(iso)4F and mammalian eIF-4G has been isolated. Zoo blot analysis indicates that Eif4g2 is a single-copy gene that is highly conserved among vertebrates. Northern blot analysis shows that Eif4g2 is ubiquitously expressed at high levels in all human and mouse tissues examined. The 3810-nucleotide Eif4g2 cDNA contains a 907-amino-acid open reading frame that codes for a polypeptide with a predicted molecular mass of 102 kDa. The Eif4g2 polypeptide exhibits an overall similarity to wheat p82 of 52%. A 248-amino-acid segment at the amino-terminal end of both peptides exhibits 63% similarity and contains conserved potential RNA binding domains and a phosphorylation site. The Eif4g2 polypeptide contains multiple potential N-linked glycosylation sites as well as protein kinase C and casein kinase II phosphorylation sites. Southern blot analysis of DNA from interspecific backcross mice shows that Eif4g2 is localized to distal mouse chromosome 7 in a region syntenic with human chromosome 11p15."

"8824200","abstracttext","Previous work indicated that nuclear extracts isolated from embryogenic rice suspension cells treated with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) have enhanced binding activity to an ABA response element (Em1a) in the promoter of the Em gene from wheat. We identified an activity in wheat and maize nuclear extracts that enhances binding of the recombinant transcription factor EmBP-1 to Em1a by 80-fold. Fractionation of nuclear extracts led us to identify histone H1 and HMGb (but not HMGc or -d) as two factors that can enhance the ability of EmBP-1 to bind to Em1a and account for at least a part of this activity of nuclear extracts. Our results, which indicate for the first time that histone H1 possesses this type of activity, lend further support to the model that positively charged proteins can drastically affect the DNA binding activity of specific transcription factors. Furthermore, our study points to these chromosomal proteins as potential targets of an ABA-mediated modification (e.g. acetylation) that could affect the regulation of Em gene expression."
"9255520","articletitle","PCR-based isolation and chromosome assignment of members of the Em gene family from wheat."
"9255520","abstracttext","Four members belonging to the wheat Em gene family were isolated by PCR, cloned and subsequently sequenced. One of the genes corresponds perfectly to a previous published cDNA sequence, the other three genes are new. The amplified sequences contain the entire coding region, which is interrupted by a short intron of variable length, and part of the 3' untranslated region. The chromosomal assignment of each of the four sequences and three extra, previously published, Em sequences was determined using PCR with sequence-specific primers on wheat aneuploid nullitetrasomic lines. Three sequences were shown to be encoded by the Em-A1 locus (on chromosome 1A), one by Em-B1 on chromosome 1B and two by Em-D1 on chromosome 1D. Hence, primer sets specific for each of the three homoeologous chromosomes of the group 1 are available. A lot of DNA sequence polymorphism exists among the sequences most of which is found in the non-coding parts and mainly in the introns. Sequence alignment groups the seven known Em sequences irrespective of their locus origin. The implication of these findings in relation to the organisation and evolution of the Em gene family are discussed."
"8400374","articletitle","Translational frameshifting by barley yellow dwarf virus RNA (PAV serotype) in Escherichia coli and in eukaryotic cell-free extracts."
"8400374","abstracttext","The open reading frame (39K ORF) at the 5' end of the genome of barley yellow dwarf virus, PAV serotype (BYDV-PAV), overlaps with a 60K ORF by 13 nucleotides. Several approaches were used to show that the 60K ORF (putative polymerase gene) is translated by a low-frequency frameshift event in which some ribosomes shift into the 60K ORF rather than terminate at the 39K ORF stop codon. A sequence encompassing this region of overlap induced minus one (-1) translational frameshifting in heterologous and native contexts. In Escherichia coli, with the alpha subunit of lacZ used as a reporter gene, the rate of frameshifting caused by the BYDV-PAV sequence was approximately 3%. Amino acid sequencing of the transframe protein confirmed that ribosomes slip into the -1 frame in the overlapping region which includes a consensus shifty heptanucleotide: GGGUUUU. In a wheat germ translation system, BYDV-PAV genomic RNA from virions frameshifted about twice as efficiently as full-length transcripts from a cDNA clone. Frameshifting in rabbit reticulocyte lysates was much lower for either template. The identity of the 99-kDa wheat germ translation product was verified as the transframe protein by immunoprecipitation with antibody specific for the 60K ORF. These results support our previous observations of frameshifting in protoplasts and illustrate a subtle molecular control mechanism between this pathogen and its host cells."

"10960733","abstracttext","Mycotoxins are fungal secondary compounds that are toxic to vertebrates. Their presence in food and feeds, as the result of fungal disease in crops, can present a danger to animal or human health. Many mycotoxins have also been shown to be phytotoxic and in some cases, such as with trichothecenes produced by the wheat head blight fungus Fusarium graminearum, mycotoxins may act as virulence factors. Antibiotic-producing organisms, including fungi, protect themselves from their own toxins by metabolic alteration of the compound, modification of the target site of action or by exporting the compound to the extracellular space. We have tested the effectiveness of adapting two of these strategies, metabolic alteration and extracellular transport, to protect plant cells from the deleterious effects of the trichothecene 4,15-diacetoxyscirpenol (DAS). Tobacco plants were transformed with either the Saccharomyces cerevisiae gene PDR5, which encodes a multi-drug transporter, or with the Fusarium sporotrichioides gene TRI101, which encodes a trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase. Both genes conferred significant increased tolerance to DAS as measured by a sensitive seed germination assay. Expression of PDR5 or TRI101 in a seed-specific manner in crop plants such as wheat could lower the incidence of head blight as well as reduce mycotoxin levels within the seed."

The selected STS markers for resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24 and Lr28 were identified in seven accessions by seven European laboratories. Near-isogenic lines of the spring wheat Thatcher were used as positive controls. Markers for resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24 were identified in all seven laboratories as amplification products of 1100 bp, 310 bp, 130 bp and 310 bp, respectively. The STS markers linked to resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24, Lr29, Lr35 and the SSR marker for Lr39 were robust and highly specific for these genes and will be useful in marker-assisted selection in wheat. However, the amplification product of 378 bp that corresponded with resistance gene Lr28 was detected in all accessions including genotypes lacking this gene in all seven laboratories.

"12223854","abstracttext","A rapid Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation system for wheat was developed using freshly isolated immature embryos, precultured immature embryos, and embryogenic calli as explants. The explants were inoculated with a disarmed A. tumefaciens strain C58 (ABI) harboring the binary vector pMON18365 containing the [beta]-glucuronidase gene with an intron, and a selectable marker, the neomycin phosphotransferase II gene. Various factors were found to influence the transfer-DNA delivery efficiency, such as explant tissue and surfactants present in the inoculation medium. The inoculated immature embryos or embryogenic calli were selected on G418-containing media. Transgenic plants were regenerated from all three types of explants. The total time required from inoculation to the establishment of plants in soil was 2.5 to 3 months. So far, more than 100 transgenic events have been produced. Almost all transformants were morphologically normal. Stable integration, expression, and inheritance of the transgenes were confirmed by molecular and genetic analysis. One to five copies of the transgene were integrated into the wheat genome without rearrangement. Approximately 35% of the transgenic plants received a single copy of the transgenes based on Southern analysis of 26 events. Transgenes in T1 progeny segregated in a Mendelian fashion in most of the transgenic plants."

"11999852","abstracttext","Comparative genetic mapping has indicated that the grass family (Poaceae) exhibits extensive chromosomal collinearity. In order to investigate microcollinearity in these genomes, several laboratories have begun to undertake comparative DNA sequence analyses of orthologous chromosome segments from various grass species. Five different regions have now been investigated in detail, with four regions sequenced for maize, rice and sorghum, plus two for wheat and one for barley. In all five of these segments, gene rearrangements were observed in at least one of the comparisons. Most of the detected rearrangements are small, involving the inversion, duplication, translocation or deletion of DNA segments that contain only 1-3 genes. Even closely related species, like barley and wheat or maize and sorghum, exhibit approximately 20% alterations in gene content or orientation. These results indicate that thousands of small genetic rearrangements have occurred in several grass lineages since their divergence from common ancestors. These rearrangements have largely been missed by genetic mapping and will both complicate and enrich the use of comparative genetics in the grasses."

The average polymorphic information content (PIC) of SAMPL primers was 0.221 and that of SAMPL markers was 0.264. The marker index of SAMPL markers was 9.61. The genetic similarity (GS) coefficients for 1,485 pairs of genotypes ranged from 0.35 to 0.96 with an average of 0.65. A dendrogram was prepared on the basis of a similarity matrix using the UPGMA algorithm, which corresponded well with the results of principal component analysis (PCA). From a total of 55 genotypes, 54 could be distinguished using the SAMPL banding patterns of both primers. For gene tagging, 568 bands from a total of 1,185 SAMPL bands detected polymorphism between each of the three pairs of parents differing for grain protein content (GPC), pre-harvest sprouting tolerance (PHST) and grain weight (GW). An association of six bands with GPC, of seven bands with PHST and four bands with GW was observed using bulked segregant analysis (BSA)."

All these genes, except TaRr16, were up-regulated in the rust-inoculated resistant line. TaRr16 has constitutive expression in the rust-resistant line while no expression was detected in the rust-susceptible line. A number of those cDNAs revealed homology to genes previously identified in other plant-pathogen interactions. Two out of the 34 cDNAs, mapped in the distal part of chromosome 6BL and TaRr16, was genetically linked to the Lr3 gene. DNA sequence differences and differential expression between non-allelic copies of TaRr16, are also reported."

"15954633","abstracttext","The rheological properties of wheat grains are associated with the composition of the starchy endosperm in high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin proteins. The HMW glutenin 1xDy12 subunit gene was co introduced with the screenable bar and the reporter gus marker genes in the commercial spring wheat Minaret cultivar (cv). The gene of interest and the marker genes were carried by two separated plasmids, the pBS10BH1 and the pAhC25 respectively. Seven days old calli initiated from immature embryos were bombarded by use of the PDS-1000/He device. A number of different bombardment and culture conditions were tested. These parameters were evaluated on the basis of GUS transient expression. Among those a 4 degrees C cold pre-treatment of the spikes before immature embryos were excised, the culture medium incorporating activated charcoal, silver nitrate and glucose yielded higher GUS transient expression rate. The selective agent bialaphos was maintained at various stages during culture from induction of somatic embryogenesis to rooting of regenerated plantlets. 137 bialaphos resistant plants were obtained among which 109 were carried to maturity. Transgenic plants were characterized by PCR, Southern and SDS-PAGE analysis of the glutenin content."
"14612572","articletitle","The classical Ubisch bodies carry a sporophytically produced structural protein (RAFTIN) that is essential for pollen development."
"14612572","abstracttext","Pollen fecundity is crucial to crop productivity and also to biodiversity in general. Pollen development is supported by the tapetum, a metabolically active sporophytic nurse layer that devotes itself to this process. The tapetum in cereals and a vast majority of other plants is of the nonamoeboid type. Unable to reach out to microspores, it secretes nutrients into the anther locule where the microspores reside and develop. Orbicules (Ubisch bodies), studied in various plants since their discovery approximately 140 years ago, are a hallmark of the secretory tapetum. Their significance to tapetal or pollen development has not been established. We have identified in wheat and rice an anther-specific single-copy gene (per haploid genome equivalent) whose suppression in rice by RNA interference nearly eliminated the seed set. The flowers in the transgenics were normal for female functions, but the pollen collapsed and became less viable. Further characterization of the gene product, named RAFTIN, in wheat has shown that it is present in pro-orbicule bodies and it is accumulated in Ubisch bodies. Furthermore, it is targeted to microspore exine. Although the carboxyl portion of RAFTINs shares short, dispersed amino acid sequences (BURP domain) in common with a variety of proteins of disparate biological contexts, the occurrence RAFTIN per se is limited to cereals; neither the Arabidopsis genome nor the vast collection of ESTs suggests any obvious dicot homologs. Furthermore, our results show that RAFTIN is essential for the late phase of pollen development in cereals."

"16284743","abstracttext","The fungal genus Puccinia contains more than 4,000 species. Puccinia triticina, causal agent of wheat leaf rust, is an economically significant, biotrophic basidiomycete. Little is known about the molecular biology of this group, and tools for understanding gene function have not yet been established. A set of parameters was established for the transient transformation of urediniospores. The expression of three heterologous promoters (actin, elongation factor 1-alpha, and Hss1, Heat Shock 70 protein), derived from Puccinia graminis, was evaluated along with the potential for insertional mutagenesis. The UidA (GUS) gene was used as a marker for transient expression. When transferred into P. triticina urediniospores, transient expression was observed across four helium pressures using one size of gold and three sizes of tungsten microprojectiles. Each of the three promoters displayed strong transient expression in germinated urediniospores; however, higher numbers of GUS-positive urediniospores were observed when either the actin or Hss1 promoters were used. Possible concomitant insertional mutagenesis of several avirulence genes was selected in wheat cultivars harboring the cognate resistance genes. Using a linearized cloning plasmid, stable integration into the genome was achieved as demonstrated by PCR and sequencing analysis."

"16453712","abstracttext","The genes for the large (rbcL) and small (rbcS) subunits of ribulose-1,5 bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBPCase) from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus PCC 6301, and the rbcS gene of wheat, have been expressed in Escherichia coli in order to study homologous and heterologous enzyme assembly. Synechococcus L subunits expressed in E. coli in the absence of S subunits assemble into oligomeric structures without detectable enzyme activity. Co-expression of L and S subunits, achieved after infection with an M13 recombinant phage containing the rbcS gene, restores enzyme activity, thus demonstrating the essential role of S in the formation of an active RuBPCase. The S subunit, however, is neither required for the solubility nor for the assembly of the L subunits into oligomeric forms. The specific activity of the homologous Synechococcus RuBPCase can be modulated by changing the intracellular pool size of S by phage infection. Heterologous assembly between L subunits of Synechococcus and S subunits of wheat can be demonstrated and results in a functional enzyme. The hybrid RuBPCase has approximately 10% of the activity of the homologous Synechococcus enzyme."
"16604111","articletitle","Rapid evolution in sequence and length of the nuclear-located gene for mitochondrial L2 ribosomal protein in cereals."
"16604111","abstracttext","The L2 ribosomal protein is typically one of the most conserved proteins in the ribosome and is universally present in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic cytosolic and organellar ribosomes. It is usually 260-270 amino acids long and its binding to the large-subunit ribosomal RNA near the peptidyl transferase center is mediated by a beta-barrel RNA-binding domain with 10 beta strands. In the diverse land plants Marchantia polymorpha (liverwort) and Oryza sativa (rice), the mitochondrial-encoded L2 ribosomal protein is about 500 amino acids long owing to a centrally located expansion containing the beta3-beta4 strand region. We have determined that, in wheat, the functional rpl2 gene has been transferred to the nucleus and much of the plant-specific internal insert has been deleted. Its mRNA is only 1.2 kb, and two expressed copies in wheat encode proteins of 318 and 319 amino acids, so they are considerably shorter than the maize nuclear-located rpl2 gene of 448 codons. Comparative sequence analysis of cereal mitochondrial L2 ribosomal proteins indicates that the mid region has undergone unexpectedly rapid evolution during the last 60 million years."

"18944352","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, causal agent of tan spot, induces necrosis and chlorosis in its wheat host. The tan spot system conforms to the toxin model and three host-specific toxins have been identified (Ptr ToxA, Ptr ToxB, and putative Ptr ToxC). Processing of a collection of isolates, obtained in the Fertile Crescent and Caucasus regions, yielded two new virulence patterns. Isolate Az35-5 combined the virulences of races 2 and 5 and was classified in the new race 7. Isolates TS93-71B and TS93-71F had a virulence pattern that combined those of races 2, 3, and 5 and were grouped in the new race 8. Southern analysis revealed that all three isolates possessed copies of the ToxA and ToxB genes, the first time the genes were found in a common background. The production of Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB by the isolates was confirmed by western blotting. Virulence patterns suggested that TS93-71B and TS93-71F may also produce Ptr ToxC, even though it was not present at detectable levels in culture filtrates. The identification of races 7 and 8 complete the theoretical maximum number of races that can be differentiated by three loci in the host (2(3) = 8), assuming a one-to-one relationship. It appears that the wheat/P. tritici-repentis system is a mirror image of the classical gene-for-gene relationship."

"18944987","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Canadian wheat cvs. Pasqua and AC Taber were examined genetically to determine the number and identity of stem rust resistance genes in both. The two cultivars were crossed with stem rust susceptible line RL6071, and sets of random F(6) lines were developed from each cross. The F(6) lines, parents, and tester lines with single stem rust resistance genes were grown in a field rust nursery, inoculated with a mixture of stem and leaf rust races, and evaluated for rust resistance. The same wheat lines were tested by inoculation with specific stem rust races in seedling tests to postulate which Sr genes were segregating in the F6 lines. Segregation of F(6) lines indicated that Pasqua had three genes that conditioned field resistance to stem rust and had seedling genes Sr5, Sr6, Sr7a, Sr9b, and Sr12. Leaf rust resistance gene Lr34, which is in Pasqua, was associated with adult-plant stem rust resistance in the segregating F(6) lines. Adult-plant gene Sr2 was postulated to condition field resistance in AC Taber, and seedling genes Sr9b, Sr11, and Sr12 also were postulated to be in AC Taber."

"17562688","abstracttext","Phosphorus deficiency is one of the major nutrient stresses affecting plant growth. Plants respond to phosphate (Pi) deficiency through multiple strategies, including the synthesis of high-affinity Pi transporters. In this study, the expression pattern of one putative wheat high-affinity phosphate transporter, TaPT2, was examined in roots and leaves under Pi-deficient conditions. TaPT2 transcript levels increased in roots of Pi-starved plants. A 579 bp fragment of the TaPT2 promoter is sufficient to drive the expression of the GUS reporter gene specifically in roots of Pi-deprived wheat. This TaPT2 promoter fragment was also able to drive expression of the GUS reporter gene in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, under similar growth conditions. Conserved regions and candidate regulatory motifs were detected by comparing this promoter with Pi transporter promoters from barley, rice, and Arabidopsis. Altogether, these results indicate that there are conserved cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors that enable the TaPT2 promoter to be regulated in a tissue-specific and Pi-dependent fashion in both monocots and dicots."
"16936842","articletitle","A resistance-like gene identified by EST mapping and its association with a QTL controlling Fusarium head blight infection on wheat chromosome 3BS."
"16936842","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major disease in the wheat growing regions of the world. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) on the short arm of chromosome 3B controls much of the variation for resistance. The cloning of candidate disease-resistance genes for FHB QTLs on chromosome 3B can provide further elucidation of the mechanisms that control resistance. However, rearrangements and divergence during plant genome evolution often hampers the identification of sequences with similarity to known disease-resistance genes. This study focuses on the use of wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) that map to the region on chromosome 3B containing the QTL for FHB resistance and low-stringency BLAST searching to identify sequences with similarity to known disease-resistance genes. One EST rich with leucine repeats and low similarity to a protein kinase domain of the barley Rpg1 gene was identified. Genetic mapping using a Ning894037 x Alondra recombinant inbred (RI) population showed that this EST mapped to the QTL on the short arm of chromosome 3B and may represent a portion of a newly diverged gene contributing to FHB resistance. The EST is a new marker suitable for marker-assisted selection and provides a starting point to begin map-based cloning for chromosome walking and investigate new diverged genes at this locus."

"16899084","abstracttext","The vast majority of angiosperms are (or were once) polyploid, and as hexaploid bread wheat has undergone two ploidy events separated by approximately 0.5 million years, it represents an elegant model to study gene silencing over time in polyploids. Using an SSCP platform, we have analysed patterns of transcriptional silencing (frequency, genome identity and organ specificity) within 236 single-copy genes, each mapping to one locus on one of the three homoeologous chromosomes within groups 1, 2, 3 and 7 of wheat. In about 27% of unigenes expressed in leaf, and about 26% of those in root, one (rarely two) members of a gene set (homoeoalleles) were not present in the cDNA template. Organ-specific regulation is commonplace, with many homoeoalleles transcribed in leaf but not root (and vice versa). There was little indication of extensive bias towards selective silencing of a particular genome copy. Expression of some of the silenced homoeoalleles was restored in certain aneuploid lines and varieties, and these displayed a significant degree of genetic variation for the silencing of a given homoeoallele. We propose that a substantial proportion of this phenomenon is effected by an epigenetic mechanism, and suggest that this form of genetic variation may be a significant player in the determination of phenotypic diversity in breeding populations."

"16989277","abstracttext","The thirty-three 5' flanking conserved sequences of the known low-molecular-weight subunit (LMW-GS) genes have been divided into eight clusters, which was in agreement with the classification based on the deduced N-terminal protein sequences. The DNA polymorphism between the eight clusters was obtained by sequence alignment, and a total of 34 polymorphic positions were observed in the approximately 200 bp regions, among which 18 polymorphic positions were candidate SNPs. Seven cluster-specific primer sets were designed for seven out of eight clusters containing cluster-specific bases, with which the genomic DNA of the ditelosomic lines of group 1 chromosomes of a wheat variety 'Chinese Spring' was employed to carry out chromosome assignment. The subsequent cloning and DNA sequencing of PCR fragments validated the sequences specificity of the 5' flanking conserved sequences between LMW-GS gene groups in different genomes. These results suggested that the coding and 5' flanking regions of LMW-GS genes are likely to have evolved in concerted fashion. The seven primer sets developed in this study could be used to isolate the complete ORFs of seven groups of LMW-GS genes, respectively, and therefore possess great value for further research in the contributions of a single LMW-GS gene to wheat quality in the complex genetic background and the efficient selections of quality-related components in breeding programs."
"17202125","articletitle","Functional genomics of abiotic stress tolerance in cereals."
"17202125","abstracttext","Abiotic stresses such as extreme temperatures, low water availability, high salt and mineral deficiencies or toxicities severely diminish productivity of cereal crops. These stresses are becoming increasingly important because of the declining availability of good quality water, land degradation and community pressures to move away from chemical intervention in agriculture. Of the major cereals, wheat and barley are grown in the most hostile and consequently lowest yielding environments. Extensive genetic studies and surveys of landrace and wild germplasm have indicated extensive variation for abiotic stress tolerance but this has been difficult to exploit due to the relatively poor background knowledge of the molecular basis for stress in these species. Interconnected signal transduction pathways that lead to multiple responses to abiotic stresses have been difficult to study using traditional approaches because of their complexity and the large number of genes and gene products involved in the various defensive and developmental responses of the plant. Functional genomics is now widely seen as providing tools for dissecting abiotic stress responses in wheat and barley, through which networks of stress perception, signal transduction and defensive responses can be examined from gene transcription, through protein complements of cells, to the metabolite profiles of stressed tissues."

"17631271","abstracttext","In hexaploid wheat, Xip-I is the only XIP-type xylanase inhibitor gene whose expression and function have been characterized in detail. Here we demonstrate the existence of new XIP-type genes with the identification of Xip-R1 and Xip-R2 in the root cDNAs. Southern blot analysis with the Xip-R1 probe revealed that XIP-type genes comprised a significantly greater gene family than previously speculated on in studies with the Xip-I probe. The transcript level of Xip-R genes was increased upon an inoculation with Erysiphe graminis in the leaves, but not with Fusarium graminearum in the spikelets. RT-PCR with the RNA samples followed by extensive sequencing of the cloned amplified products revealed the presence of 12 highly similar Xip-R genes. Among these genes, Xip-R1 was the only predominant Xip-R family member induced to express in response to E. graminis. XIP-R1 was located in the apoplastic space and inhibited family 11 xylanases, but the protein did not show chitinolytic activity. These results suggest that hexaploid wheat has a large family of XIPs in its genome, but that only some of them are expressed for plant defense in limited tissues."

"20013800","abstracttext","Clostridium cellulolyticum is a model mesophilic anaerobic bacterium that efficiently degrades plant cell walls. The recent genome release offers the opportunity to analyse its complete degradation system. A total of 148 putative carbohydrate-active enzymes were identified, and their modular structures and activities were predicted. Among them, 62 dockerin-containing proteins bear catalytic modules from numerous carbohydrate-active enzymes' families and whose diversity reflects the chemical and structural complexity of the plant carbohydrate. The composition of the cellulosomes produced by C. cellulolyticum upon growth on different substrates (cellulose, xylan, and wheat straw) was investigated by LC MS/MS. The majority of the proteins encoded by the cip-cel operon, essential for cellulose degradation, were detected in all cellulosome preparations. In the presence of wheat straw, the natural and most complex of the substrates studied, additional proteins predicted to be involved in hemicellulose degradation were produced. A 32-kb gene cluster encodes the majority of these proteins, all harbouring carbohydrate-binding module 6 or carbohydrate-binding module 22 xylan-binding modules along dockerins. This newly identified xyl-doc gene cluster, specialised in hemicellulose degradation, comes in addition of the cip-cel operon for plant cell wall degradation. Hydrolysis efficiencies determined on the different substrates corroborates the finding that cellulosome composition is adapted to the growth substrate."

The percentages of homologous genes varied greatly among different Pst libraries with 54.51%, 51.21%, and 13.61% for the urediniospore, germinated urediniospore, and haustorial libraries, respectively, with an average of 33.92%. The 1,432 Pst genes with significant homology with Pgt sequences were grouped into physical groups corresponding to 237 Pgt supercontigs. The physical relationship was demonstrated by 12 pairs (57%), out of 21 selected Pst gene pairs, through PCR screening of a Pst BAC library. The results indicate that the Pgt genome sequence is useful in constructing Pst physical maps."

Results showed significant differences between races in their pathogenicity and between genotypes in their resistance to the pathogen. Diallel cross carried out between the parents and progenies and thereafter were analyzed by the method of Griffing and Haymans. The General Combining Ability (GCA) and Special Combining Ability (SCA) for all traits were significant and showed additive variance was more important. Test for validity of diallel hypothesis proved epistasis effect for all traits. P1, P2 and F1 showed significant difference between all traits in generations mean analysis. Average degree of dominance ranged from partial to over dominance for resistance or susceptibility. Dominance, additive and epistatic types of gene action were responsible for the genetic control of the traits. However, except for additive-additive component, non-additive effect of genes could not be fixed by self-fertilization."

"22033869","abstracttext","The leaf rust resistance gene Lr25, transferred from Secale cereale L. into wheat and located on chromosome 4B, imparts resistance to all pathotypes of leaf rust in South-East Asia. In an F(2)-derived F(3) population, created by crossing TcLr25 that carries the gene Lr25 for leaf rust resistance with leaf rust-susceptible parent Agra Local, three microsatellite markers located on the long arm of chromosome 4B were found to be linked to the Lr25 locus. The donor parent TcLr25 is a near-isogenic line derived from the variety Thatcher. The most virulent pathotype of leaf rust in the South-East Asian region, designated 77-5 (121R63-1), was used for challenging the population under artificially controlled conditions. The marker Xgwm251 behaved as a co-dominant marker placed 3.8 cM away from the Lr25 locus on 4BL. Two null allele markers, Xgwm538 and Xgwm6, in the same linkage group were located at a distance of 3.8 cM and 16.2 cM from the Lr25 locus, respectively. The genetic sequence of Xgwm251, Lr25, Xgwm538, and Xgwm6 covered a total length of 20 cM on 4BL.

"20951189","abstracttext","Most hexaploid wheat genes are present as triplicate homoeologs derived from the ancestral species. Previously, we isolated six wheat cDNAs with open reading frame, encoding methyl CpG-binding domain proteins (MBDs). In this study, the genomic and cDNA sequences of three TaMBD2 homoeologous genes were obtained and mapped on chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D, respectively. These sequences showed a very high conservation in the coding region and the exon/intron structure, but the cDNA sequences are distinguishable by a 9-bp insertion in coding region and a size polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR). The expression patterns of each homeologous gene in different tissues of various developmental stages and in response to abiotic stress were analyzed by using real-time PCR. Relative mRNA abundance of the three homoeologs varied considerably in different developmental stages from seedling to developing seeds. Most notably, TaMBD2-5B and TaMBD2-5D were highly responsive to salt stress and TaMBD2-5B was specifically upregulated by low temperature in the seedling leaves. These results provide further evidence for the expression variation of genes duplicated in allopolyploids. Moreover, the variation of TaMBD2 homoeologous gene expression in response to environmental stress may enable plants to better cope with stresses in their natural environments."

"20696006","abstracttext","Mycosphaerella graminicola is a major pathogen of wheat worldwide, causing Septoria leaf blotch disease. Targeted gene disruption in M. graminicola, by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, has become an established functional genomics tool for M. graminicola research in recent years. However, in order to advance research into this economically important pathogen, further functional genomics tools need to be developed. Here, we report three new capabilities for M. graminicola research: (i) two selectable markers have been shown to work robustly in M. graminicola, namely G418 and the fungicide carboxin; (ii) the generation of a strain of M. graminicola in which the KU70 (MUS-51) homologue has been disrupted; in this strain, homologous recombination efficiencies increased to more than 95%, whilst maintaining wild-type growth in vitro and full pathogenicity on wheat leaves; (iii) the ability to efficiently target and generate precise mutations of specific genes in the genomic context in M. graminicola. In addition, the insertion of the E198A mutation into the beta-tubulin gene (MgTUB1), conferring resistance to the fungicide benomyl, suggests that this mutant allele may provide an additional selectable marker. The collective use of these tools will permit further advancements in our knowledge of the biology and pathogenicity of this important plant pathogen."

"21120468","abstracttext","An endo-β-1,4-xylanase gene, designated xyn10G5, was cloned from Phialophora sp. G5 and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The 1,197-bp full-length gene encodes a polypeptide of 399 amino acids consisting of a putative signal peptide at residues 1-20, a family 10 glycoside hydrolase domain, a short Gly/Thr-rich linker and a family 1 carbohydrate-binding module (CBM). The deduced amino acid sequence of XYN10G5 shares the highest identity (53.4%) with a putative xylanase precursor from Aspergillus terreus NIH2624. The purified recombinant XYN10G5 exhibited the optimal activity at pH 4.0 and 70 °C, remained stable at pH 3.0-9.0 (>70% of the maximal activity), and was highly thermostable at 70 °C (retaining ~90% of the initial activity for 1 h). Substrate specificity studies have shown that XYN10G5 had the highest activity on soluble wheat arabinoxylan (350.6 U mg(-1)), and moderate activity to various heteroxylans, and low activity on different types of cellulosic substrates. Under simulated gastric conditions, XYN10G5 was stable and released more reducing sugars from soluble wheat arabinoxylan; when combined with a glucanase (CelA4), the viscosity of barley-soybean feed was significantly reduced. These favorable enzymatic properties make XYN10G5 a good candidate for application in the animal feed industry."
"21193575","articletitle","Cross activity of orthologous WRKY transcription factors in wheat and Arabidopsis."
"21193575","abstracttext","WRKY proteins are transcription factors involved in many plant processes including plant responses to pathogens. Here, the cross activity of TaWRKY78 from the monocot wheat and AtWRKY20 from the dicot Arabidopsis on the cognate promoters of the orthologous PR4-type genes wPR4e and AtHEL of wheat and Arabidopsis, respectively, was investigated. In vitro analysis showed the ability of TaWRKY78 to bind a -17/+80 region of the wPR4e promoter, containing one cis-acting W-box. Moreover, transient expression analysis performed on both TaWRKY78 and AtWRKY20 showed their ability to recognize the cognate cis-acting elements present in the wPR4e and AtHEL promoters, respectively. Finally, this paper provides evidence that both transcription factors are able to cross-regulate the orthologous PR4 genes with an efficiency slightly lower than that exerted on the cognate promoters. The observation that orthologous genes are subjected to similar transcriptional control by orthologous transcription factors demonstrates that the terminal stages of signal transduction pathways leading to defence are conserved and suggests a fundamental role of PR4 genes in plant defence. Moreover, these results corroborate the hypothesis that gene orthology imply similar gene function and that diversification between monocot and dicot has most likely occurred after the specialization of WRKY function."

"21354583","abstracttext","The first isolated cytokinin, 6-furfurylaminopurine (kinetin or Kin), was identified almost 55years ago. Its biological effects on plant cells and tissues include influences on such processes as gene expression, cell cycle, chloroplast development, chlorophyll biosynthesis, stimulation of vascular development, delay of senescence, and mobilization of nutrients. In the present study we prepared a series of eight N9-substituted Kin derivatives, and characterized them with available physicochemical methods such as CI+ mass spectrometry and (1)H NMR spectroscopy. All compounds were tested in three classical cytokinin bioassays: a tobacco callus assay, an Amaranthus assay, and a senescence assay with excised wheat leaves. The ability of the compounds to interact with Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors CRE1/AHK4 and AHK3 was tested in a bacterial receptor assay. Prepared derivatives with certain substitutions of the N9-atom of the purine moiety enhanced the cytokinin activity of the parent compound in the bioassays to a remarkable degree but negatively affected its perception by CRE1/AHK4 and AHK3. The ability of compounds to delay the senescence of excised wheat leaves in both dark and light conditions, was highly correlated with their ability to influence membrane lipid peroxidation, which is a typical symptom of senescence. Our results were corroborated by gene expression profiling of those genes involved in cytokinin metabolism and perception, plant senescence, and the stress response, and suggest that prepared kinetin derivatives might be used as potent anti-senescence agents."

"21726376","abstracttext","An RNA silencing construct was used to alter mycotoxin production in the plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium culmorum, the incitant of crown and foot rot on wheat. The transformation of a wild-type strain and its nitrate reductase-deficient mutant with inverted repeat transgenes (IRTs) containing sequences corresponding to the trichothecene regulatory gene TRI6 was achieved using hygromycin B resistance as a selectable marker. Southern analysis revealed a variety of integration patterns of the TRI6 IRT. One transformant underwent homologous recombination with deletion of the endogenous TRI6 gene, whereas, in another transformant, the TRI6 IRT was not integrated into the genome. The TRI6 IRT did not alter the physiological characteristics, such as spore production, pigmentation or growth rate, on solid media. In most transformants, a high TRI6 amplification signal was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, corresponding to a TRI6-hybridizing smear of degraded fragments by Northern analysis, whereas TRI5 expression decreased compared with the respective nontransformed strain. Four transformants showed increased TRI5 expression, which was correlated with a dramatic (up to 28-fold) augmentation of deoxynivalenol production. Pathogenicity assays on durum wheat seedlings confirmed that impairment of deoxynivalenol production in the TRI6 IRT transformants correlated with a loss of virulence, with decreased disease indices ranging from 40% to 80% in nine silenced strains, whereas the overproducing transformants displayed higher virulence compared with the wild-type."

"23054223","abstracttext","In this study, we report the expression of HMW-GSs in 87 accessions of tetraploid wheat, the characterization of three inactive and one active HMW glutenin genes, and the functional verification of HMW-GSs by promoter-GUS expression. SDS-PAGE profiles revealed that tetraploid wheat has many different combinations of HMW-GSs and the number of subunits varies from 1 to 4. HMW glutenin genes at the Glu-A1x, Glu-A1y and Glu-B1y loci exhibited different frequencies of inaction while the Glu-B1x allele was expressed in all 87 accessions. Gene cloning showed that only 1Bx (Tdu-e) could express a full-length protein and its deduced protein sequence has the typical primary structure but with fewer cysteine residues. The expression of the other three HMW glutenin genes has been disrupted by stop codons in their repetitive domains. Besides short indels or mutations of one or more bases, an 85-bp deletion and a 185-bp insertion were found in the promoter regions of 1Ay (Tdu-s) and 1Bx (Tdu-e). The transient expression of promoter-GUS constructs indicated that the 1Ay promoter can drive expression of the GUS gene. We conclude that defects (stop codons or the insertion of large transposon-like elements) in the coding regions may be the most probable cause for the inaction of the HMW glutenin genes."

"23393585","abstracttext","To discover the structural and functional novel glycoside hydrolase enzymes from soil fungal communities that decompose cellulosic biomass, transcripts of functional genes in a forest soil were analyzed. Pyrosequencing of the Avicel and wheat-amended soil cDNAs produced 56,084 putative protein-coding sequence (CDS) fragments, and the most dominant group of putative CDSs based on the taxonomic analysis was assigned to the domain Eukarya, which accounted for 99% of the total number of the putative CDSs. Of 9,449 eukaryotic CDSs whose functions could be categorized, approximately 40% of the putative CDSs corresponded to metabolism-related genes, including genes involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, and energy metabolism. Among the carbohydrate-metabolism genes, 129 sequences encoded glycoside hydrolase enzymes, with 47 sequences being putative cellulases belonging to 13 GH families. To characterize the function of glycoside hydrolase enzymes, we synthesized the putative CelA gene with codon optimization for heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, which was shown to be similar to the structure of plant expansins, and observed stimulation for cellulase activity on Avicel degradation. This study demonstrated that fungal communities adapt to Avicel and wheat decomposition and that metatranscriptomic sequence data can be reference data for identifying a novel gene."

"23591594","abstracttext","Whole-cell mass spectrometry analysis is a powerful tool to rapidly identify microorganisms. Several studies reported the successful application of this technique to identify a variety of bacterial species with a discriminatory power at the strain level, mainly for bacteria of clinical importance. In this study we used matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) to assess the diversity of wheat-associated bacterial isolates. Wheat plants cultivated in non-sterile vermiculite, under greenhouse conditions were used for bacterial isolation. Total cellular extracts of 138 isolates were analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and the mass spectra were used to cluster the isolates. Taxonomic identification and phylogenetic reconstruction based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed the presence of Pseudomonas, Pantoea, Acinetobacter, Enterobacter and Curtobacterium. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses were congruent with the clusterization from mass spectra profile. Moreover, MALDI-TOF whole cell mass profiling allowed a finer discrimination of the isolates, suggesting that this technique has the potential of differentiating bacterial isolates at the strain level."

"24759739","abstracttext","Productivity of wheat crop is largely dependent on its growth and development that, in turn, is mainly regulated by environmental conditions, including abiotic stress factors. miRNAs are key regulators of gene expression networks involved in diverse aspects of development and stress responses in plants. Using high-throughput sequencing of eight small RNA libraries prepared from diverse abiotic stresses and tissues, we identified 47 known miRNAs belonging to 20 families, 49 true novel and 1030 candidate novel miRNAs. Digital gene expression analysis revealed that 257 miRNAs exhibited tissue-specific expression and 74 were associated with abiotic stresses. Putative target genes were predicted for miRNAs identified in this study and their grouping into functional categories indicated that the putative targets were involved in diverse biological processes. RLM-RACE of predicted targets of three known miRNAs (miR156, miR160 and miR164) confirmed their mRNA cleavage, thus indicating their regulation at post-transcriptional level by the corresponding miRNAs. Mapping of the sequenced data onto the wheat progenitors and closely related monocots revealed a large number of evolutionary conserved miRNAs. Additional expression profiling of some of these miRNAs in other abiotic stresses underline their involvement in multiple stresses. Our findings provide valuable resource for an improved understanding of the role of miRNAs in stress tolerance as well as plant development."

"24694394","abstracttext","The ditelosomic line for the long arm of chromosome 4B (4BL) of Chinese Spring (CS) wheat is not available because it is completely male sterile. Since all deletions in the 4B short arm (4BS) cause male sterility in the homozygous condition, a male-fertility gene should be located in a distal region of 4BS. Among the selfed progeny of a hybrid between a male-sterile 4BS deletion plant (4BS-8) and a Japanese common wheat cultivar Norin 61 (N61), we obtained self-fertile 4BS-8 homozygous deletion plants. We also found fertile nullisomic-4B plants among the selfed progeny of a hybrid between a monosomic line 4B of N61 and CS. This fact suggested that N61 has a novel male-fertility gene on a chromosome other than 4B. We established a self-fertile ditelosomic 4BL line after backcrossing a fertile 4BS-8 plant to CS monotelodisomic 4BL. By cytological observation and PCR analysis using 16 SSR markers, we verified that this ditelosomic line lacked the entire 4BS arm and found that three of the markers were on 4BS. We conducted deletion mapping using three 4BS homozygous deletion lines and three 4BS-specific markers."

"24094051","abstracttext","The greenbug aphid, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) is an important cereal pest, periodically threatening wheat yields in the United States and around the world. The single dominant gene, Gb3-based resistance is highly durable against prevailing greenbug biotypes under field conditions; however, the molecular mechanisms of Gb3-mediated defense responses remain unknown. We used Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Arrays to investigate the transcriptomics of host defense responses upon greenbug feeding on resistant and susceptible bulks (RB and SB, respectively) derived from two near-isogenic lines. The study identified 692 differentially expressed transcripts and further functional classification recognized 122 transcripts that are putatively associated to mediate biotic stress responses. In RB, Gb3-mediated resistance resulted in activation of transmembrane receptor kinases and signaling-related transcripts involved in early signal transduction cascades. While in SB, transcripts mediating final steps in jasmonic acid biosynthesis, redox homeostasis, peroxidases, glutathione S-transferases, and notable defense-related secondary metabolites were induced. Also transcripts involved in callose and cell wall decomposition were elevated SB, plausibly to facilitate uninterrupted feeding operations. These results suggest that Gb3-mediated resistance is less vulnerable to cell wall modification and the data provides ample tools for further investigations concerning R gene based model of resistance."

"24142469","abstracttext","A xylanase gene was isolated from the genomic DNA of Streptomyces coelicolor Ac-738. The 723-bp full-length gene encoded a 241-amino acid peptide consisting of a 49-residue putative TAT signal peptide and a glycoside hydrolase family-11 domain. The mature enzyme called XSC738 was expressed in Escherichia coli M15[pREP4]. The electrophoretically homogeneous protein with a specific activity of 167 U/mg for beechwood xylan was purified. The pH optimum of XSC738 was at pH 6; a high activity was retained within a pH range of 4.5-8.5. The enzyme was thermostable at 50-60 °C and retained an activity at pH 3.0-7.0. Xylanase XSC738 was activated by Mn²⁺, Co²⁺ and largely inhibited by Cd²⁺, SDS and EDTA. The products of xylan hydrolysis were mainly xylobiose, xylotriose, xylopentaose and xylohexose. Xylotetraose appeared as a minor product. Processing of such agricultural xylan-containing products as wheat, oats, soy flour and wheat bran by xylanase resulted in an increased content of sugars."

"24162479","abstracttext","High-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits are a particular class of wheat endosperm proteins containing a large repetitive domain flanked by two short N- and C-terminal non-repetitive regions. Deletions and insertions within the central repetitive domain has been suggested to be mainly responsible for the length variations observed for this class of proteins. Nucleotide sequence comparison of a number of HMW glutenin genes allowed the identification of small insertions or deletions within the repetitive domain. However, only indirect evidence has been produced which suggests the occurrence of substantial insertions or deletions within this region when a large variation in molecular size is present between different HMW glutenin subunits. This paper represents the first report on the molecular characterization of an unusually large insertion within the repetitive domain of a functional HMW glutenin gene. This gene is located at the Glu-D1 locus of a hexaploid wheat genotype and contains an insertion of 561 base pairs that codes for 187 amino acids corresponding to the repetitive domain of a HMW glutenin subunit encoded at the same locus. The precise location of the insertion has been identified and the molecular processes underlying such mutational events are discussed."

"24177825","abstracttext","Deficiency of the wheat waxy (Wx) proteins (Wx-A1, Wx-B1 and Wx-D1) was studied in 1,960 cultivars derived from several countries. Gel electrophoretic analyses revealed that the null allele for the Wx-A1 protein occurred frequently in Korean, Japanese and Turkish wheats but was relatively rare in cultivars from other countries and regions. About 48% of the wheats deficient for the Wx-B1 protein were from Australia and India. One Chinese cultivar lacked the WxD1 protein. While 9 Japanese cultivars were deficient in both the Wx-A1 and Wx-B1 proteins, no cultivars lacked both the Wx-A1 and Wx-D1 proteins, both the Wx-B1 and Wx-D1 proteins or all three Wx proteins. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed polymorphisms of the three Wx proteins that varied according to isoelectric points or molecular weight. The Wx-A1 gene coding the Wx-A1 protein and the Wx-B1 gene coding the Wx-B1 protein were localized in the distal regions of chromosome arms 7AS and 4AL, respectively, by deletion mapping using the deletion lines developed in the common wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring'."

"24177841","abstracttext","The endosperm starch of the wheat grain is composed of amylose and amylopectin. Genetic manipulation of the ratio of amylose to amylopectin or the amylose content could bring about improved texture and quality of wheat flour. The chromosomal locations of genes affecting amylose content were investigated using a monosomic series of Chinese Spring (CS) and a set of Cheyenne (CNN) chromosome substitution lines in the CS genetic background. Trials over three seasons revealed that a decrease in amylose content occurred in monosomic 4A and an increase in monosomic 7B. Allelic variation between CS and CNN was suggested for the genes on chromosomes 4A and 7B. To examine the effects of three Waxy (Wx) genes which encode a granule-bound starch synthase (Wx protein), the Wx proteins from CS monosomics of interest were analyzed using SDS-PAGE. The amount of the Wx protein coded by the Wx-B1 gene on chromosome arm 4AL was reduced in monosomic 4A, and thus accounted for its decreased amylose content. The amounts of two other Wx proteins coded by the Wx-A1 and Wx-D1 genes on chromosome arms 7AS and 7DS, respectively, showed low levels of protein in the monosomics but no effect on amylose content. The effect of chromosome 7B on the level of amylose suggested the presence of a regulator gene which suppresses the activities of the Wx genes."

"24223981","abstracttext","Aquaporins are channel proteins which transport water across cell membranes. We show that the bread wheat aquaporin gene TaTIP2;2 maps to the long arm of chromosome 7b and that its product localizes to the endomembrane system. The gene is expressed constitutively in both the root and the leaf, and is down-regulated by salinity and drought stress. Salinity stress induced an increased level of C-methylation within the CNG trinucleotides in the TaTIP2;2 promoter region. The heterologous expression of TaTIP2;2 in Arabidopsis thaliana compromised its drought and salinity tolerance, suggesting that TaTIP2;2 may be a negative regulator of abiotic stress. The proline content of transgenic A. thaliana plants fell, consistent with the down-regulation of P5CS1, while the expression of SOS1, SOS2, SOS3, CBF3 and DREB2A, which are all stress tolerance-related genes acting in an ABA-independent fashion, was also down-regulated. The supply of exogenous ABA had little effect either on TaTIP2;2 expression in wheat or on the phenotype of transgenic A. thaliana. The expression level of the ABA signalling genes ABI1, ABI2 and ABF3 remained unaltered in the transgenic A. thaliana plants. Thus TaTIP2;2 probably regulates the response to stress via an ABA-independent pathway(s)."

The leucin aminopeptidase-1 (Lap-1), Aconitase-1 (Aco-1), Esterase-6 (Est-6), Esterase-8 (Est-8), and Endopeptidase-1 (Ep-1) loci were linked. The Aco-1, Est-6, and Est-8 loci have been previously located on the 6RL chromosome arm. The Lap-1 locus has been located on the 6RS chromosome arm. The results favor the gene order: Lap-1...

The isoelectric focusing separations of aqueous extracts from mature embryo tissue of wheat-rye addition and substitution lines involving the chromosomes of cereal rye Secale cereale L. confirmed the gene location of locus Ep-1 on the 6RL chromosome arm. Screening of wheat-rye addition lines involving the chromosomes of Secale montanum revealed that Ep-1 locus is not located on chromosome 6R of S. montanum.

Loci Est1, Est2, Est3, Est5, Est6 and Est7 were found on chromosome arm 5RL, Est8 and Est9 on chromosome 6R in 'Imperial' rye, and the Est10 locus on chromosome arm 4RL in 'Imperial' rye and 'King II' rye. A discrepancy was found between the chromosomal location of the Prx locus in 'Imperial' where chromosome 2R was responsible for the expression of the peroxidase enzyme, and 'King II' with chromosome 1R carrying the Prx gene. As a possible explanation, the occurrence of translocation events during the production of wheat/rye aneuploid lines is discussed. The rye Pgm locus could be associated with chromosome 4RS in 'Imperial' and 'King II' rye. Except for the location of Est loci on chromosome 5RL, the results reported in this paper lend further evidence for the assumed homoeology relationships between the chromosomes of Triticinae and for the conservation of gene synteny groups during the evolution of the Triticeae tribe."

"25144230","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum is an important disease of wheat and barley worldwide. In a previous study on functional characterization of the F. graminearum kinome, one protein kinase gene important for virulence is orthologous to SCH9 that is functionally related to the cAMP-PKA and TOR pathways in the budding yeast. In this study, we further characterized the functions of FgSCH9 in F. graminearum and its ortholog in Magnaporthe oryzae. The ΔFgsch9 mutant was slightly reduced in growth rate but significantly reduced in conidiation, DON production, and virulence on wheat heads and corn silks. It had increased tolerance to elevated temperatures but became hypersensitive to oxidative, hyperosmotic, cell wall, and membrane stresses. The ΔFgsch9 deletion also had conidium morphology defects and produced smaller conidia. These results suggest that FgSCH9 is important for stress responses, DON production, conidiogenesis, and pathogenesis in F. graminearum. In the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae, the ΔMosch9 mutant also was defective in conidiogenesis and pathogenesis. Interestingly, it also produced smaller conidia and appressoria. Taken together, our data indicate that the SCH9 kinase gene may have a conserved role in regulating conidium size and plant infection in phytopathogenic ascomycetes."

"26298806","abstracttext","Previous studies have reported that the expression of phosphate (Pi) or nitrogen (N) transporter genes in roots of plants could be regulated by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, but little is known whether the regulation is systemic or not. The present study investigated the systemic and local regulation of multiple phosphate and nitrogen transporter genes by four AM fungal species belonging to four genera in the roots of winter wheat. A split-root culture system with AM inoculated (MR) and non-inoculated root compartments (NR) was used to investigate the systemic or local responses of phosphate and nitrogen transporter genes to colonization by four AM fungi in the roots of wheat. The expression of four Pi transporter, five nitrate transporter, and three ammonium transporter genes was quantified using real-time PCR. Of the four AM fungi tested, all locally increased expression of the AM-inducible Pi transporter genes, and most locally decreased expression of a Pi-starvation inducible Pi transporter gene. The addition of N in soil increased the expression of either Pi starvation inducible Pi transporters or AM inducible Pi transporters. Inoculation with AM fungi either had no effect, or could locally or systemically down-regulate expression of nitrogen transporter genes depending on gene type and AM fungal species."

In this work, the gene of α-L-arabinofuranosidase 4 (ABF4) has been sequenced and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The gene is 1521 pb long, has no introns and codes for a protein of 506 amino acid residues including a signal peptide of 26 residues. Mature protein has a calculated molecular mass of 55.4 kDa, shows 77% identity with α-L-arabinofuranosidase 1 from P. purpurogenum and belongs to family 54 of the glycosyl hydrolases. Purified enzyme has a molecular mass near 68 kDa, is active on p-nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside and p-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactofuranoside, and follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics with KM of 1.58 ± 0.13 mM and 5.3 ± 1.18 mM, respectively. The pH optimum is 4.6 and optimal temperature is 50 °C. The enzyme is active on sugar beet arabinan and wheat flour arabinoxylan but does not act on short arabinooligosaccharides or debranched arabinan. It shows synergistic effect on arabinose liberation from wheat arabinoxylan when combined with endoxylanase from P. purpurogenum. The properties of ABF4 have been compared with those of the other arabinofuranosidases produced by the fungus. P. purpurogenum is the first fungus possessing four biochemically characterized arabinofuranosidases. The availability of four different ABFs may be valuable for biotechnological applications."

"26882849","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the fungal pathogen that causes globally important diseases of cereals and produces mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). Owing to the dearth of available sources of resistance to Fusarium pathogens, characterization of novel genes that confer resistance to mycotoxins and mycotoxin-producing fungi is vitally important for breeding resistant crop varieties. In this study, a wheat methionyl-tRNA synthetase (TaMetRS) gene was identified from suspension cell cultures treated with DON. It shares conserved aminoacylation catalytic and tRNA anticodon binding domains with human MetRS and with the only previously characterized plant MetRS, suggesting that it functions in aminoacylation in the cytoplasm. However, the TaMetRS comprises a typical nuclear localization signal and cellular localization studies with a TaMetRS::GFP fusion protein showed that TaMetRS is localized in the nucleus. Expression of TaMetRS was activated by DON treatment and by infection with a DON-producing F. graminearum strain in wheat spikes. No such activation was observed following infection with a non-DON-producing F. graminearum strain. Expression of TaMetRS in Arabidopsis plants conferred significant resistance to DON and F. graminearum. These results indicated that this DON-activated TaMetRS gene may encode a novel type of MetRS in plants that has a role in defense and detoxification."

"26900170","abstracttext","Genes which confer partial resistance to the rusts in wheat figure prominently in discussions of potential durable resistance strategies. The positional cloning of the first of these genes, Lr34/Yr18 and Yr36 , has revealed different protein structures, suggesting that the category of partial resistance genes, as defined by phenotype, likely groups together suites of functionally heterogenous genes. With the number of mapped partial rust resistance genes increasing rapidly as a result of ongoing advances in marker and sequencing technologies, breeding programs needing to select and prioritize genes for deployment confront a fundamental question: which genes or gene combinations are more likely to provide durable protection against these evolving pathogens? We argue that a refined classification of partial rust resistance genes is required to start answering this question, one based not merely on disease phenotype but also on gene cloning, molecular functional characterization, and interactions with other host and pathogen proteins. Combined with accurate and detailed disease phenotyping and standard genetic studies, an integrated wheat-rust interactome promises to provide the basis for a functional classification of partial resistance genes and thus a conceptual framework for their rational deployment."

"26747045","abstracttext_key message","Spot blotch disease resistance gene Sb3 was mapped to a 0.15 centimorgan (cM) genetic interval spanning a 602 kb physical genomic region on chromosome 3BS. Wheat spot blotch disease, caused by B. sorokiniana, is a devastating disease that can cause severe yield losses. Although inoculum levels can be reduced by planting disease-free seed, treatment of plants with fungicides and crop rotation, genetic resistance is likely to be a robust, economical and environmentally friendly tool in the control of spot blotch. The winter wheat line 621-7-1 confers immune resistance against B. sorokiniana. Genetic analysis indicates that the spot blotch resistance of 621-7-1 is controlled by a single dominant gene, provisionally designated Sb3. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping showed that Sb3 is located on chromosome arm 3BS linked with markers Xbarc133 and Xbarc147. Seven and twelve new polymorphic markers were developed from the Chinese Spring 3BS shotgun survey sequence contigs and 3BS reference sequences, respectively. Finally, Sb3 was mapped in a 0.15 cM genetic interval spanning a 602 kb physical genomic region of Chinese Spring chromosome 3BS. The genetic and physical maps of Sb3 provide a framework for map-based cloning and marker-assisted selection (MAS) of the spot blotch resistance."

"26706080","abstracttext","We previously isolated four cDNAs in durum wheat, TdsPLA2I, TdsPLA2II, TdsPLA2III and TdsPLA2IV, that encode proteins with homology to plant secretory phospholipases A2 (sPLA2s) (Verlotta et al., Int. J. Mol. Sci., 14, 2013, 5146-5169). In this study, we have further characterized TdsPLA2II and TdsPLA2III sequences that, on the basis of our previous findings, might encode sPLA2 isoforms with different features. Functional analysis revealed that, similarly to other known sPLA2s, TdsPLA2II and TdsPLA2III have an optimum at pH 9.0, require Ca(2+), are heat stable, and are inhibited by the disulfide-bond-reducing agent dithiothreitol. However, differences emerged between these TdsPLA2 isoforms. Transcript analysis revealed that the TdsPLA2III gene is highly up-regulated under different environmental stresses; conversely, the TdsPLA2II gene is expressed at constant levels under almost all of the stress conditions examined. Moreover, TdsPLA2II is saturated at micromolar substrate and Ca(2+) concentrations, whereas TdsPLA2III requires millimolar concentrations to reach maximal activity. This suggests that TdsPLA2II normally functions under optimal conditions in vivo, whereas TdsPLA2III is only partially activated, depending on the specific phospholipid and Ca(2+) levels. Altogether these data lead to the hypothesis that in vivo TdsPLA2II and TdsPLA2III are differently regulated at both molecular and biochemical level and that TdsPLA2III plays a major role in durum wheat response to adverse environmental conditions."

"27071705","abstracttext","In this study, we report the contribution of a PDI-like gene from wheat wild relative Haynaldia villosa in combating powdery mildew. PDI-V protein contains two conserved thioredoxin (TRX) active domains (a and a') and an inactive domain (b). PDI-V interacted with E3 ligase CMPG1-V protein, which is a positive regulator of powdery mildew response. PDI-V was mono-ubiquitinated by CMPG1-V without degradation being detected. PDI-V was located on H. villosa chromosome 5V and encoded for a protein located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Bgt infection in leaves of H. villosa induced PDI-V expression. Virus induced gene silencing of PDIs in a T. durum-H. villosa amphiploid compromised the resistance. Single cell transient over-expression of PDI-V or a truncated version containing the active TXR domain a decreased the haustorial index in moderately susceptible wheat cultivar Yangmai 158. Stable transgenic lines over-expressing PDI-V in Yangmai 158 displayed improved powdery mildew resistance at both the seedling and adult stages. By contrast over-expression of point-mutated PDI-V(C57A) did not increase the level of resistance in Yangmai 158. The above results indicate a pivotal role of PDI-V in powdery mildew resistance and showed that conserved TRX domain a is critical for its function."

"27109372","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the major causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat and barley and is considered to be one of the most devastating plant diseases worldwide. Chitin is a critical component of the fungal cell wall and is polymerized from UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine by chitin synthase. We characterized FgCHS8, a new class of the chitin synthase gene in F. graminearum. Disruption of FgCHS8 resulted in reduced accumulation of chitin, decreased chitin synthase activity, and had no effect on conidia growth when compared with the wild-type isolate. ΔFgCHS8 had a growth rate comparable to that of the wild-type isolate in vitro. However, ΔFgCHS8 had reduced growth when grown on agar supplemented with either 0.025% SDS or 0.9 mM salicylic acid. ΔFgCHS8 produced significantly less deoxynivalenol and exhibited reduced pathogenicity in wheat spikes. Re-introduction of a functional FgCHS8 gene into the ΔFgCHS8 mutant strain restored the wild-type phenotypes. Fluorescence microscopy revealed that FgCHS8 protein was initially expressed in the septa zone, and then gradually distributed over the entire cellular membrane, indicating that FgCHS8 was required for cell wall development. Our results demonstrated that FgCHS8 is important for cell wall sensitivity to environmental stress factors and deoxynivalenol production in F. graminearum."

"27110058","abstracttext","Asparagine is an important nitrogen storage and transport molecule, but its accumulation as a free amino acid in crops has implications for food safety because free asparagine is a precursor for acrylamide formation during cooking and processing. Asparagine synthesis occurs by the amidation of aspartate, catalysed by asparagine synthetase, and this study concerned the expression of asparagine synthetase ( TaASN ) genes in wheat. The expression of three genes, TaASN1-3 , was studied in different tissues and in response to nitrogen and sulphur supply. The expression of TaASN2 in the embryo and endosperm during mid to late grain development was the highest of any of the genes in any tissue. Both TaASN1 and TaASN2 increased in expression through grain development, and in the grain of field-grown plants during mid-development in response to sulphur deprivation. However, only TaASN1 was affected by nitrogen or sulphur supply in pot-based experiments, showing complex tissue-specific and developmentally-changing responses. A putative N-motif or GCN4-like regulatory motif was found in the promoter of TaASN1 genes from several cereal species. As the study was completed, a fourth gene, TaASN4 , was identified from recently available genome data. Phylogenetic analysis showed that other cereal species have similar asparagine synthetase gene families to wheat."

"26991509","abstracttext","The Clearfield(®) wheat cultivars possessing imidazolinone (IMI)-resistant traits provide an efficient option for controlling weeds. The imazamox-resistant cultivar Pantera (Clearfield(®) ) was compared with a susceptible cultivar (Gazul). Target and non-target mechanisms of resistance were studied to characterize the resistance of Pantera and to identify the importance of each mechanism involved in this resistance. Pantera is resistant to imazamox as was determined in previous experiments. The molecular study confirmed that it carries a mutation Ser-Asn627 conferring resistance to imazamox in two out of three acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes (imi1 and imi2), located in wheat on chromosomes 6B and 6D, respectively. However, the last gene (imi3) located on chromosome 6A does not carry any mutation conferring resistance. As a result, photosynthetic activity and chlorophyll content were reduced after imazamox treatment. Detoxification was higher in the resistant biotype as shown by metabolomic study while imazamox translocation was higher in the susceptible cultivar. Interestingly, imazamox metabolism was higher at higher doses of herbicide, which suggests that the detoxification process is an inducible mechanism in which the upregulation of key gene coding for detoxification enzymes could play an important role. Thus, the identification of cultivars with a higher detoxification potential would allow the development of more resistant varieties."

"27446108","abstracttext","Tyrosine phosphorylation protein A (TypA/BipA) belongs to the ribosome-binding GTPase superfamily. In many bacterial species, TypA acts as a global stress and virulence regulator and also mediates resistance to the antimicrobial peptide bactericidal permeability-increasing protein. However, the function of TypA in plants under biotic stresses is not known. In this study, we isolated and functionally characterized a stress-responsive TypA gene (TaTypA) from wheat, with three copies located on chromosomes 6A, 6B, and 6D, respectively. Transient expression assays indicated chloroplast localization of TaTypA. The transcript levels of TaTypA were up-regulated in response to treatment with methyl viologen, which induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) in chloroplasts through photoreaction, cold stress, and infection by an avirulent strain of the stripe rust pathogen. Knock down of the expression of TaTypA through virus-induced gene silencing decreased the resistance of wheat to stripe rust accompanied by weakened ROS accumulation and hypersensitive response, an increase in TaCAT and TaSOD expression, and an increase in pathogen hyphal growth and branching. Our findings suggest that TaTypA contributes to resistance in an ROS-dependent manner."

"27399209","abstracttext","Accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) following plant-pathogen interactions can trigger plant defence responses and directly damage pathogens. Thus, it is essential for pathogens to scavenge host-derived ROS to establish a parasitic relationship. However, the mechanisms protecting pathogens from host-derived oxidative stress remain unclear. In this study, a superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene, PsSOD1, was cloned from a wheat-Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) interaction cDNA library. Transcripts of PsSOD1 were up-regulated in the early infection stage. Heterologous mutant complementation and biochemical characterization revealed that PsSOD1 encoded a Zn-only SOD. The predicted signal peptide was functional in an invertase-mutated yeast strain. Furthermore, immunoblot analysis of apoplastic proteins in Pst-infected wheat leaves and bimolecular fluorescence complementation suggested that PsSOD1 is a secreted protein that potentially forms a dimer during Pst infection. Overexpression of PsSOD1 enhanced Schizosaccharomyces pombe resistance to exogenous superoxide. Transient expression of PsSOD1 in Nicotiana benthamiana suppressed Bax-induced cell death. Knockdown of PsSOD1 using a host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) system reduced the virulence of Pst, which was associated with ROS accumulation in HIGS plants. These results suggest that PsSOD1 is an important pathogenicity factor that is secreted into the host-pathogen interface to contribute to Pst infection by scavenging host-derived ROS."

"27434809","abstracttext","Wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunit variation is important because of its great influence on glutenin polymer structure, that is related to dough technological properties. Among the different subunits, the pair Bx20 and By20 is known to have a negative effect on quality, but the reasons are not clear: Bx20 has two cysteines, which theoretically make this subunit a chain extender of the glutenin polymer, just like the other Bx subunits, showing four cysteines, two of which should be involved in intra-molecular disulfide bonds. By20 has never been characterized so far at molecular level. Here we report the nucleotide sequences of Bx20 and By20 genes isolated from the durum wheat cultivar 'Lira 45' and the validation of the corresponding deduced amino acid sequences by using MALDI-TOF and LC-MS/MS. Four nucleotide differences were identified in the Bx20 gene with respect to the deduced sequence present in NCBI, causing two amino acid substitutions. For the By20 subunit, nucleotide and amino acid sequences revealed a great similarity to By15, both at gene and protein levels, showing five nucleotide changes generating two amino acid differences. No evidence of post-translational modifications has been found. Hypotheses are formulated in regard to relationships with technological quality. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

"29183598","abstracttext","Shepherd's purse is a troublesome dicot weed that occurs in the major wheat-producing areas in China. Twenty-eight shepherd's purse populations were collected from winter wheat-planting areas in Henan Province and used to evaluate tribenuron-methyl resistance and acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) gene-mutation diversity. The results indicate that all 28 shepherd's purse populations were resistant to tribenuron-methyl at different levels compared with the susceptible population. Mutation of the 197 codon (CCT) changed proline (Pro) into tyrosine (Tyr), histidine (His), leucine (Leu), serine (Ser), arginine (Arg), alanine (Ala) and threonine (Thr), whereas mutation of the 574 codon (TGG) changed tryptophan (Trp) into leucine (Leu). Among these amino acid changes, a co-concurrence of Pro197Leu and Trp574Leu substitutions was identified for the first time in resistant weed species. Furthermore, Pro197Tyr, Pro197Arg and Pro197Ala substitutions have not been previously reported in shepherd's purse. The results of the in vitro AHAS assay suggest that an insensitive AHAS is likely involved in the resistance to tribenuron-methyl in the R populations with AHAS gene mutations, and the non-target-site based resistance might exist in some populations."

"28443125","abstracttext","Recent advances in genome engineering (GE) has made it possible to precisely alter DNA sequences in plant cells, providing specifically engineered plants with traits of interest. Gene targeting efficiency depends on the delivery-method of both sequence-specific nucleases and repair templates, to plant cells. Typically, this is achieved using Agrobacterium mediated transformation or particle bombardment, both of which transform only a subset of cells in treated tissues. The alternate in planta approaches, stably integrating nuclease-encoding cassettes and repair templates into the plant genome, are time consuming, expensive and require extra regulations. More efficient GE reagents delivery methods are clearly needed if GE is to become routine, especially in economically important crops that are difficult to transform. Recently, autonomously replicating virus-based vectors have been demonstrated as efficient means of delivering GE reagents in plants. Both DNA viruses ( Bean yellow dwarf virus, Wheat dwarf virus and Cabbage leaf curl virus ) and RNA virus ( Tobacco rattle virus ) have demonstrated efficient gene targeting frequencies in model plants ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) and crops (potato, tomato, rice, and wheat). Here we discuss the recent advances using viral vectors for plant genome engineering, the current limitations and future directions."

"28426157","abstracttext","In addition to its role in vernalization, temperature is an important environmental stimulus in determining plant growth and development. We used factorial combinations of two photoperiods (16H, 12H) and three temperature levels (11, 18 and 25 °C) to study the temperature responses of 19 wheat cultivars with established genetic relationships. Temperature produced more significant effects on plant development than photoperiod, with strong genotypic components. Wheat genotypes with PPD-D1 photoperiod sensitive allele were sensitive to temperature; their development was delayed by higher temperature, which intensified under non-inductive conditions. The effect of temperature on plant development was not proportional; it influenced the stem elongation to the largest extent, and warmer temperature lengthened the lag phase between the detection of first node and the beginning of intensive stem elongation. The gene expression patterns of VRN1, VRN2 and PPD1 were also significantly modified by temperature, while VRN3 was more chronologically regulated. The associations between VRN1 and VRN3 gene expression with early apex development were significant in all treatments but were only significant for later plant developmental phases under optimal conditions (16H and 18 °C). Under 16H, the magnitude of the transient peak expression of VRN2 observed at 18 and 25 °C associated with the later developmental phases."

"28520767","abstracttext","Development of anthers and pollen represents an important aspect of the life cycle in flowering plants. Genes contributing to anther and pollen development have been widely studied in many plant species. Ms26/CYP704B genes play an important role in pollen development through biosynthesis of sporopollenin for pollen exine formation. To investigate the role of Ms26/CYP704B genes in anther and pollen development of bread wheat, mutations in the A-, B-, and D-homeologs of the putative Ms26/CYP704B gene were analyzed. Single and double homozygous mutants in any of the homeologs did not affect pollen development and male fertility. Triple homozygous mutants resulted in completely male sterile plants that were defective in pollen and anther development. Additionally, double homozygous-single heterozygous mutants were also male sterile although with varying levels of residual fertility. The fertility of these triple mutants was dependent upon the homeolog contributing the wild-type allele. Two heterologous Ms26/CYP704B genes, when transformed into a triple homozygous mutant background, completely restored male fertility, whereas a single gene was unable to restore fertility. Functional analysis of Ms26/CYP704B furthers the understanding of male fertility genes which can be utilized for the development of novel hybrid seed production systems in wheat."

Our aim was to determine the bioremediation of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) from wheat fields which have a long history of herbicide in Sanandaj. Based on our literature survey, this study is the first report to isolate and identify antimicrobial resistant bacteria from polluted wheat field soils in Sanandaj which has the capacity to degrade 2,4-D. From 150 2,4-D-exposed soil samples, five different bacteria were isolated and identified based on biochemical tests and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA). Pseudomonas has been the most frequently isolated genus. By sequencing the 16S rRNA gene of the isolated bacteria, the strains were detected and identified as a member of the genus Pseudomonas sp, Entrobacter sp, Bacillus sp, Seratia sp, and Staphylococcus sp. The sequence of Sanandaj 1 isolate displayed 87% similarity with the 16S rRNA gene of a Pseudomonas sp (HE995788). Similarly, all the isolates were compared to standard strains based on 16S rRNA. Small amounts of 2,4-D could be transmitted to a depth of 10-20 cm; however, in the depth of 20-40 cm, we could not detect the 2,4-D. The isolates were resistant to various antibiotics particularly, penicillin, ampicillin, and amoxicillin."

The expression of the gene (Gt-apuΔC) was higher under GAP promoter (36.2 U ml -1 , α-amylase; 33.5 U ml -1 , pullulanase) than that under AOX1 promoter (32.5 and 28.6 U ml -1 ). The heavily glycosylated Gt-apuΔC from the recombinant P. pastoris displays higher substrate specificity, thermal stability and starch saccharification efficiency than that expressed in Escherichia coli. The enzyme hydrolyses maltotriose and maltotetraose unlike that expressed in E. coli. The enzyme action on wheat bran liberates maltose and glucose without detectable amount(s) of maltooligosaccharides. The sugars released from wheat bran (glucose and maltose) could be fractionated by ultrafiltration, as confirmed by TLC and HPLC analysis. This is the first report on the production of recombinant amylopullulanase extracellularly in P. pastoris."

In this study, we performed genotypic and phenotypic race characterization of a large collection of P. triticirepentis isolates from these countries to determine race structure and utilize this information for better disease management and breeding wheat for tan spot resistance. We characterized 231 single spore isolates from Latvia (n = 15), Lithuania (n = 107), and Romania (n = 109) for Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB genes using two genes specific primers. A subset (139) of 231 isolates were further characterized for their race structure by inoculating them individually on tan spot wheat differentials set. Majority (83%) of the 231 isolates amplified Ptr ToxA gene suggesting prevalence of race 1 and 2. Further, phenotypic characterization of 139 isolates also showed wide prevalence of races 1 (68%), 2 (8%), 3 (11%), and 4 (5%) were also identified from Baltic States as well as Romania. Eighteen of the isolates (13%) did not seem to be of any of the eight known races as they lacked Ptr ToxA gene but they behaved like either race 1 or race 2, suggesting possibility of novel toxins in these isolates as their virulence tools."

"28273925","abstracttext","Semi-dwarf traits have been widely introgressed into cereal crops to improve lodging resistance. In sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench), four major unlinked dwarfing genes, Dw1-Dw4, have been introduced to reduce plant height, and among them, Dw3 and Dw1 have been cloned. Dw3 encodes a gene involved in auxin transport, whereas, Dw1 was recently isolated and identified as a gene encoding a protein of unknown function. In this study, we show that DW1 is a novel component of brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Sorghum possessing the mutated allele of Dw1 (dw1), showed similar phenotypes to rice BR-deficient mutants, such as reduced lamina joint bending, attenuated skotomorphogenesis, and insensitivity against feedback regulation of BR-related genes. Furthermore, DW1 interacted with a negative regulator of BR signaling, BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 2 (BIN2), and inhibited its nuclear localization, indicating that DW1 positively regulates BR signaling by inhibiting the function of BIN2. In contrast to rice and wheat breeding which used gibberellin (GA) deficiency to reduce plant height, sorghum breeding modified auxin and BR signaling. This difference may result from GA deficiency in rice and wheat does not cause deleterious side effects on plant morphology, whereas in sorghum it leads to abnormal culm bending."

"28790347","abstracttext","Subunit pair 1Dx5 + 1Dy10 was recognized as superior subunit combination in wheat and contained an extra repetitive-domain cysteine residue in 1Dx5 that was important for understanding the formation of dough viscoelasticity. In this research, one specific serine codon of the 1Ax1 gene corresponding to the extra cysteine residue of 1Dx5 was substituted by a cysteine codon through site-directed mutagenesis. Four homozygous transgenic lines (T 4 ) expressing the mutant 1Ax1 gene (mut1Ax1) were produced. Their greater dough strength and stability were confirmed by mixograph and were associated with highly increased gluten index, larger amounts of gluten macropolymers, larger size distribution for glutenin macropolymer particles and varied sodium-dodecyl-sulfate sedimentation volumes, compared with those of the one line expressing wild 1Ax1 that had similar expression level of transgene. The contents of β-sheets in dough and disulfide groups in gluten of the mut1Ax1 transgenic lines were significantly increased. The microstructure of dough mixed to peak showed a more continuous gluten matrix in the mutant transgenic lines than the one line mentioned-above. It was concluded that the extra cysteine residue of mutant 1Ax1 subunit plays a positive role in contributing to dough strength and stability of wheat by cross-linking into gluten aggregates through inter-chain disulfide bonds."

"28842569","abstracttext","Degradation of toxins by microorganisms is a promising approach for detoxification of agricultural products. Here, a bacterial strain, Sphingomonas S3-4, that has the ability to degrade the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) was isolated from wheat fields. Incubation of Fusarium-infected wheat grains with S3-4 completely eliminated DON. In S3-4 DON is catabolized into compounds with no detectable phytotoxicity, 3-oxo-DON and 3-epi-DON, via two sequential reactions. Comparative analysis of genome sequences from two DON-degrading strains, S3-4 and Devosia D17, and one non-DON-degrading strain, Sphingobium S26, combined with functional screening of a S3-4 genomic BAC library led to the discovery that a novel aldo/keto reductase superfamily member, AKR18A1, is responsible for oxidation of DON into 3-oxo-DON. DON-degrading activity is completely abolished in a mutant S3-4 strain where the AKR18A1 gene is disrupted. Recombinant AKR18A1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli catalyzed the reversible oxidation/reduction of DON at a wide range of pH values (7.5 to 11) and temperatures (10 to 50 °C). The S3-4 strain and recombinant AKR18A1 also catabolized zearalenone and the aldehydes glyoxal and methyglyoxal. The S3-4 strain and the AKR18A1 gene are promising agents for the control of Fusarium pathogens and detoxification of mycotoxins in plants and in food/feed products."

"28912789","abstracttext","Grass genomes are complicated structures as they share a common tetraploidization, and particular genomes have been further affected by extra polyploidizations. These events and the following genomic re-patternings have resulted in a complex, interweaving gene homology both within a genome, and between genomes. Accurately deciphering the structure of these complicated plant genomes would help us better understand their compositional and functional evolution at multiple scales. Here, we build on our previous research by performing a hierarchical alignment of the common wheat genome vis-à-vis eight other sequenced grass genomes with most up-to-date assemblies, and annotations. With this data, we constructed a list of the homologous genes, and then, in a layer-by-layer process, separated their orthology, and paralogy that were established by speciations and recursive polyploidizations, respectively. Compared with the other grasses, the far fewer collinear outparalogous genes within each of three subgenomes of common wheat suggest that homoeologous recombination, and genomic fractionation should have occurred after its formation. In sum, this work contributes to the establishment of an important and timely comparative genomics platform for researchers in the grass community and possibly beyond.

Forty bacteria isolated from the rhizoplane of P. roxburghii growing in a cold climate at high altitude in Murree, were morphologically characterised; nine were identified by 16S rRNA sequence analyses and used in experiments. Diversity and abundance of the 16S rRNA gene and nifH gene in the rhizosphere was assessed by cloning, RFLP analysis, 454-amplicon pyrosequencing and qPCR. The bacterial isolates significantly improved dry weight of shoot, root, root area, IAA and GA 3 content, number of grains plant -1 , weight of grains plant -1 in wheat varieties Chakwal-50 and Fareed-06 under axenic and field conditions.

"32191897","abstracttext","Wheat is an important cereal crop grown worldwide but it's yield is severely affected by various biotic and abiotic stresses. SNAREs are key regulators of vesicle trafficking and are present in abundance in higher plant species suggesting their prominence in growth and development. Novel Plant SNAREs (NPSN) are found exclusively in plants. Hence, a comprehensive analysis of these two gene families in wheat genome was accomplished in this study. We report here 27 SNAREs and eight NPSN genes. These genes and their respective proteins were investigated for gene structure, physiochemical properties, domain and motif architecture, phylogeny, chromosomal localization and possible interactions. Phylogenetic and motif analysis confirmed SNARE domain in all the proteins. Functional annotation revealed participation in biological process like vesicle fusion, exocytosis, protein targeting to vacuole and SNAP receptor activity. At subcellular level, SNAREs were localized in multiple organelles whereas NPSN proteins were localized in cytoplasm where they regulate vesicle fusion. The 3-D structures built with Modeller proved the presence of SNARE motifs in the identified proteins. Possible protein-protein interactions between SNARE and NPSN proteins were determined and docking was performed. The results augmented our understanding about molecular function, evolutionary relation, location inside the cell and their interactions."

"32173682","abstracttext","Most deletions for the short arm of chromosome 2A (2AS), and the telocentric chromosome for the long arm of chromosome 2A (2AL), are available only in the heterozygous condition in 'Chinese Spring' hexaploid wheat. This is due to the female sterility, and therefore self-sterility, of their homozygotes, caused by the partial or entire loss of the 2AS chromosome arm on which genes for normal synapsis and female fertility are located. On the other hand, a D-genome disomic substitution line 2D(2A) of 'Langdon' tetraploid wheat, in which chromosome 2D is disomically substituted for chromosome 2A, is available (i.e., self-fertile) despite chromosome 2A being missing in this line. This fact indicates that another gene for female fertility must be present in Langdon 2D(2A). We attempted to develop self-fertile 2AS homozygous deletion and ditelosomic 2AL lines by transferring this female fertility gene, through a series of crosses and cytological screening, from Langdon 2D(2A) to the two aneuploid lines. We finally obtained self-fertile 2AS homozygous deletion and ditelosomic 2AL lines. These lines displayed normal meiotic chromosome pairing and lacked all 12 of the 2AS markers used for PCR analysis."

"32375344","abstracttext","The homeodomain-leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) family transcription factors play important roles in plant growth and development. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here we found that ATHB2 , encoding a HD-ZIP transcription factor, is an early auxin responsive gene. Phenotypic analyses show that overexpression of ATHB2 impairs plant architecture, including reduced plant height and small leaves, and also reduces auxin response in leaves when grown in soil. Simultaneously, the seedlings with chemical induction of ATHB2 exhibit abnormal root gravitropism, a typical auxin-related phenotype. We further show that the auxin response pattern is altered in roots of the inducible ATHB2 seedlings. Consistently, the transcript levels of some auxin biosynthetic and transport genes are significantly decreased in these transgenic seedlings. Further, protein and promoter sequence analyses in common wheat showed that the HD-ZIP II subfamily transcription factors have highly conserved motifs and most of these encoding gene promoters contain the canonical auxin-responsive elements. Expression analyses confirm that some of these HD-ZIP II genes are indeed regulated by auxin in wheat. Together, our results suggest that the HD-ZIP II subfamily transcription factors regulate plant development possibly through the auxin pathway in plants."

The levels of GCN5 mRNA are increased in response to salt stress. The gcn5 mutants exhibited severe growth inhibition and defects in cell wall integrity under salt stress conditions. Combining RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, we identified the chitinase-like gene CTL1, polygalacturonase involved in expansion-3 (PGX3) and MYB domain protein-54 (MYB54) as direct targets of GCN5. Acetylation of H3K9 and H3K14 mediated by GCN5 is associated with activation of CTL1, PGX3 and MYB54 under salt stress. Moreover, constitutive expression of CTL1 in the gcn5 mutant restores salt tolerance and cell wall integrity. In addition, the expression of the wheat TaGCN5 gene in Arabidopsis gcn5 mutant plants complemented the salt tolerance and cell wall integrity phenotypes, suggesting that GCN5-mediated salt tolerance is conserved between Arabidopsis and wheat. Taken together, our data indicate that GCN5 plays a key role in the preservation of salt tolerance via versatile regulation in plants."

"30780937","abstracttext","Identification of seedling and slow stripe rust resistance genes is important for gene pyramiding, gene deployment, and developing slow-rusting wheat cultivars to control the disease. A total of 98 Chinese lines were inoculated with 26 pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici for postulation of stripe rust resistance genes effective at the seedling stage. A total of 135 wheat lines were planted at two locations to characterize their slow rusting responses to stripe rust in the 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 cropping seasons. Genes Yr2, Yr3a, Yr4a, Yr6, Yr7, Yr9, Yr26, Yr27, and YrSD, either singly or in combinations, were postulated in 72 lines, whereas known resistance genes were not identified in the other 26 accessions. The resistance genes Yr9 and Yr26 were found in 42 and 19 accessions, respectively. Yr3a and Yr4a were detected in two lines, and four lines may contain Yr6. Three lines were postulated to possess YrSD, one carried Yr27, and one may possess Yr7. Thirty-three lines showed slow stripe rusting resistance at two locations in both seasons."

"30908531","abstracttext","Grain-size is one of the yield components, and the first 14 days after pollination (DAP) is a crucial stage for wheat grain-size formation. To understand the mechanism of grain-size formation at the whole gene expression level and to identify the candidate genes related to grain pattern formation, cDNA libraries from immature grains of 5 DAP and 14 DAP were constructed. According to transcriptome analysis, a total of 12,555 new genes and 9,358 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained. In DEGs, 2,876, 3,357 and 3,125 genes were located on A, B and D subgenome respectively. 9,937 (79.15%) new genes and 9,059 (96.80%) DEGs were successfully annotated. For DEGs, 4,453 were up-regulated and 4,905 were down-regulated at 14 DAP. The Gene Ontology (GO) database indicated that most of the grain-size-related genes were in the same cluster. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database analysis showed that 130, 129 and 20 DEGs were respectively involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, plant hormone signal transduction and ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. Expression levels of 8 randomly selected genes were confirmed by qRT-PCR, which was consistent with the transcriptome data. The present database will help us understand the molecular mechanisms underlying early grain development and provide the foundation for increasing grain-size and yield in wheat breeding programs."

"30802963","abstracttext","Appropriate regulation of crop seed germination is of significance for agriculture production. In this study, we show that TaJAZ1, most closely related to Arabidopsis JAZ3, negatively modulates abscisic acid (ABA)-inhibited seed germination and ABA-responsive gene expression in bread wheat. Biochemical interaction assays demonstrate that the C-terminal part containing the Jas domain of TaJAZ1 physically interacts with TaABI5. Similarly, Arabidopsis jasmonate-ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins also negatively modulate ABA responses. Further we find that a subset of JAZ proteins could interact with ABI5 using the luciferase complementation imaging assays. Choosing JAZ3 as a representative, we demonstrate that JAZ3 interacts with ABI5 in vivo and represses the transcriptional activation activity of ABI5. ABA application could abolish the enrichment of JAZ proteins in the ABA-responsive gene promoter. Furthermore, we find that ABA application could induce the expression of jasmonate (JA) biosynthetic genes and then increase the JA concentrations partially dependent on the function of ABI5, consequently leading to the degradation of JAZ proteins. This study sheds new light on the crosstalk between JA and ABA in modulating seed germination in bread wheat and Arabidopsis."

"30708627","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that causes Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), a yield- and quality-reducing disease of wheat. S. nodorum produces a set of necrotrophic effectors (NEs) that interact with the products of host sensitivity genes to cause cell death and increased susceptibility to disease. The focus of this study was determination of NE sensitivity among 25 winter wheat cultivars, many of them from the southeastern United States, that are susceptible to SNB, as well as the moderately resistant 'NC-Neuse'. Thirty-three isolates of S. nodorum previously collected from seven southeastern U.S. states were cultured for NE production, and the culture filtrates were used in an infiltration bioassay. Control strains of Pichia pastoris that expressed SnToxA, SnTox1, or SnTox3 were also used. All SNB-susceptible cultivars were sensitive to at least one NE, while NC-Neuse was insensitive to all NEs tested. Among the sensitive lines, 32% contained sensitivity gene Tsn1 and 64% contained sensitivity gene Snn3. None were sensitive to SnTox1. Additionally, 10 molecular markers for sensitivity genes Tsn1, Snn1, Snn2, and Snn3 were evaluated for diagnostic potential. Only the marker Xfcp623 for Tsn1 was diagnostic, and it was in perfect agreement with the results of the infiltration bioassays. The results illuminate which NE sensitivity genes may be of concern in breeding for resistance to SNB in the southeastern United States."

"30708795","abstracttext","In total, 230 single-conidial isolates of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (formerly Septoria tritici, teleomorph: Mycosphaerella graminicola) were sampled in Morocco in 2008 and 2010 to assess resistance against quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), a widely used group of fungicides in wheat pest management. All 134 isolates sampled in 2008 were QoI sensitive. In contrast, 9 of the 96 isolates from the 2010 collection were resistant, suggesting a recent emergence of the resistance. Mitochondrial (mt)DNA-sequence analyses identified four haplotypes among the resistant isolates. Wright's F statistics (F ST ) analyses from mtDNA sequences revealed a shallow population structure of Z. tritici within Morocco and a substantial asymmetric gene flow from Europe into Morocco. A phylogenetic reconstruction including Moroccan and European isolates clustered the haplotypes regardless of their geographic origin. The four Moroccan QoI-resistant mitochondrial haplotypes clustered in two distinct clades in the tree topology, suggesting at least two independent origins of the resistance. This study reported, for the first time, the occurrence of QoI-resistant genotypes of Z. tritici in Morocco. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that QoI resistance emerged very recently through parallel genetic adaptation in Morocco, although gene flow from Europe cannot be excluded."

"30353138","abstracttext","Cellulose synthase-like CslF and CslH genes have been implicated in the biosynthesis of β-glucans, a major cell wall constituents in grasses and cereals. The low β-glucan content of durum wheat and lack of information of the biosynthesis pathway make the expression analysis in different developmental stages of grain endosperm an interesting tool for the crop genetic improvement. Specific genome sequences of wheat CslF6 and CslH were isolated and the genomic sequence and structure were analysed in the cv. Svevo. In starchy endosperm at five developmental stages (6, 12, 21, 28 and 40 days after pollination) CslF6 and CslH transcripts were differentially expressed. A peak of CslF6 transcription occurred at 21 dap, while CslH was abundant at 28 dap. Significant variations were detected for both the genes in the genotypes. Significant and positive correlation were detected between β-glucan content and CslF6 gene expression at 21 dap and 40 dap, while no significant correlation was observed for CslH gene. On the overall, our correlation analysis reflected data from previous studies on other species highlighting how the abundance of transcripts encoding for CslF6 and CslH enzymes were not necessarily a good indicator of enzyme activity and/or β-glucan deposition in cell wall."

"31406132","abstracttext","Stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) is a major disease of wheat. To understand the genetic basis of stem rust resistance in Nebraska winter wheat, a set of 330 genotypes representing two nurseries (DUP2015 and TRP2015) were evaluated for resistance to a Nebraska stem rust race (QFCSC) in two replications. The TRP2015 nursery was also evaluated for its resistance to an additional 13 stem rust races. The analysis of variance revealed significant variation among genotypes in both populations for stem rust resistance. Nine stem rust genes, Sr6, Sr31, Sr1RS Amigo , Sr24, Sr36, SrTmp, Sr7b, Sr9b, and Sr38, were expected and genotyped using gene-specific markers. The results of genetic analysis confirmed the presence of seven stem rust resistance genes. One genotype (NE15680) contained target alleles for five stem rust resistance genes and had a high level of stem rust resistance against different races. Single marker analysis indicated that Sr24 and Sr38 were highly significantly associated with stem rust resistance in the DUP2015 and TRP2015 nurseries, respectively. Linkage disequilibrium analysis identified the presence of 17 SNPs in high linkage with the Sr38-specific marker. These SNPs potentially tagging the Sr38 gene could be used in marker-assisted selection after validating them in additional genetic backgrounds."

"31332216","abstracttext","Root system architecture is crucial for wheat adaptation to drought stress, but phenotyping for root traits in breeding programmes is difficult and time-consuming owing to the belowground characteristics of the system. Identifying quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and linked molecular markers and using marker-assisted selection is an efficient way to increase selection efficiency and boost genetic gains in breeding programmes. Hundreds of QTLs have been identified for different root traits in the last few years. In the current study, consensus QTL regions were identified through QTL meta-analysis. First, a consensus map comprising 7352 markers was constructed. For the meta-analysis, 754 QTLs were retrieved from the literature and 634 of them were projected onto the consensus map. Meta-analysis grouped 557 QTLs in 94 consensus QTL regions, or meta-QTLs (MQTLs), and 18 QTLs remained as singletons. The recently published genome sequence of wheat was used to search for gene models within the MQTL peaks. As a result, gene models for 68 of the 94 Root_MQTLs were found, 35 of them related to root architecture and/or drought stress response. This work will facilitate QTL cloning and pyramiding to develop new cultivars with specific root architecture for coping with environmental constraints."

"32945950","abstracttext_main conclusion","Overexpressing a heat shock factor gene (TaHsfA6bT) from wheat provides thermotolerance in barley by constitutive expression of heat and other abiotic stress-response genes. Temperature is one of the most crucial abiotic factors defining the yield potential of temperate cereal crops, such as barley. The regulators of heat shock response (HSR), heat stress transcription factors (Hsfs), modulate the transcription level of heat-responsive genes to protect the plants from heat stress. In this study, an Hsf from wheat (TaHsfA6b) is overexpressed in barley for providing thermotolerance. Transgenic barley lines overexpressing TaHsfA6b showed improvement in thermotolerance. The constitutive overexpression of a TaHsfA6b gene upregulated the expression of major heat shock proteins and other abiotic stress-responsive genes. RNA-seq and qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the upregulation of Hsps, chaperonins, DNAJ, LEA protein genes, and genes related to anti-oxidative enzymes in transgenic lines. Excessive generation and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) occurred in wild-type (WT) plants during heat stress; however, the transgenic lines reflected improved ROS homeostasis mechanisms, showing lesser ROS accumulation under high temperature. No negative phenotypic changes were observed in overexpression lines. These results suggest that TaHsfA6b is a regulator of HSR and its overexpression altered the expression patterns of some main stress-related genes and enhanced the thermotolerance of this cereal crop."

"33208893","abstracttext","Elevated CO 2 stimulates plant growth and affects quantity and composition of root exudates, followed by response of its microbiome. Three scenarios representing nitrate fertilization regimes: limited (30 ppm), moderate (70 ppm) and excess nitrate (100 ppm) were compared under ambient and elevated CO 2 (eCO 2 , 850 ppm) to elucidate their combined effects on root-surface-associated bacterial community abundance, structure and function. Wheat root-surface-associated microbiome structure and function, as well as soil and plant properties, were highly influenced by interactions between CO 2 and nitrate levels. Relative abundance of total bacteria per plant increased at eCO 2 under excess nitrate. Elevated CO 2 significantly influenced the abundance of genes encoding enzymes, transporters and secretion systems. Proteobacteria, the largest taxonomic group in wheat roots (~ 75%), is the most influenced group by eCO 2 under all nitrate levels. Rhizobiales, Burkholderiales and Pseudomonadales are responsible for most of these functional changes. A correlation was observed among the five gene-groups whose abundance was significantly changed (secretion systems, particularly type VI secretion system, biofilm formation, pyruvate, fructose and mannose metabolism). These changes in bacterial abundance and gene functions may be the result of alteration in root exudation at eCO 2 , leading to changes in bacteria colonization patterns and influencing their fitness and proliferation."

"7909603","abstracttext","Acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase, EC 6.4.1.2) catalyzes the synthesis of malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis. We studied the localization of two forms, the prokaryote and the eukaryote forms, of ACCase in pea leaves by comparing the biotin polypeptides of the two ACCases in protein extract from leaves and plastids. We found that the two forms of ACCase were in different cell compartments of pea leaves; the prokaryote form was in the plastids, and the eukaryote form was elsewhere, probably in the cytosol. This result suggested the existence of two sites of malonyl-CoA synthesis. The Gramineae, such as rice and wheat, which lack the accD gene encoding one of the subunits of the prokaryote form of ACCase in their chloroplast genomes, did not have the prokaryote form of the enzyme but had the eukaryote form. The selective grass herbicides of the diphenoxypropionic acid type and the cyclohexanedione type, in vitro, inhibited plastidic ACCase of the eukaryote form from wheat but did not inhibit that of the prokaryote form from pea, suggesting that the origin of the tolerance of intact pea plant toward these herbicides is partly in the insensitivity of the prokaryote form of the enzyme. The origin of the susceptibility of the Gramineae plants toward these herbicides seems to lie in the presence of the herbicide-sensitive eukaryote form and the absence of the insensitive prokaryote form due to the lack of the accD gene in plastid."

To investigate functional role(s) of the type I element in regulation of a wheat histone H3 gene (TH012) promoter activity in vivo, base substitution mutations were introduced into the element and activities of the mutated promoters were examined in cultured rice cells, and in regenerated roots and anther walls of transgenic rice plants by employing a GUS reporter system. Mutations of each or both of the hexamer and the octamer motifs caused a reduction in the promoter activity in protoplasts transfected transiently or stably transformed calli. The mutation of the octamer motif with or without the mutation of the hexamer motif caused a marked reduction of the promoter activity in the root meristem of transgenic rice although the mutation of the hexamer motif alone caused a weak reduction. In contrast to these results, no effect of the mutations of either the hexamer or the octamer motif was found in the anther wall in which replication-independent activity of the H3 promoter was observed. Our results suggested that the hexamer and the octamer motifs may play important role(s) in regulation of replication-dependent but not of replication-independent expression of the wheat histone H3 gene."

"7893754","abstracttext","Five histone H2A cDNA clones have been isolated from a wheat cDNA library. They were divided into two groups, termed type 1 and type 2, based on their deduced amino acid sequences and their gene expression patterns. Three type 1 clones had ORFs encoding proteins similar to angiosperm histone H2As known so far, whereas two type 2 clones encoded an identical protein, which was more similar to Norway spruce (gymnosperm) H2A than to the angiosperm H2As. The C-terminus of the type 2 H2A was shorter than that of the type 1 H2As and lacked the characteristic SPKK motif that is conserved in angiosperm H2As. Northern analysis revealed that the mRNA levels of the type 1 H2A genes were high in proliferating cells during germination and in various tissues of young seedlings, while the mRNA levels of the type 2 genes were high in non-proliferating cells in which the type 1 gene was poorly expressed. This result suggests that the expression of these two groups of H2A genes is differently regulated during development in wheat."

"18083828","abstracttext","Cch1, a putative voltage-gated calcium ion channel, was investigated for its role in ascus development in Gibberella zeae. Gene replacement mutants of CCH1 were generated and found to have asci which did not forcibly discharge spores, although morphologically ascus and ascospore development in the majority of asci appeared normal. Additionally, mycelial growth was significantly slower, and sexual development was slightly delayed in the mutant; mutant mycelia showed a distinctive fluffy morphology, and no cirrhi were produced. Wheat infected with Deltacch1 mutants developed symptoms comparable to wheat infected with the wild type; however, the mutants showed a reduced ability to protect the infected stalk from colonization by saprobic fungi. Transcriptional analysis of gene expression in mutants using the Affymetrix Fusarium microarray showed 2,449 genes with significant, twofold or greater, changes in transcript abundance across a developmental series. This work extends the role of CCH1 to forcible spore discharge in G. zeae and suggests that this channel has subtle effects on growth and development."

"18303044","abstracttext","Revolver discovered in the Triticeae plant is a novel class of transposon-like gene and a major component of the large cereal genome. An 89 bp segment of Revolver that is enriched in the genome of rye was isolated by deleting the DNA sequences common to rye and wheat. The entire structure of Revolver was determined by using rye genomic clones, which were screened by the 89 bp probe. Revolver consists of 2929-3041 bp with an inverted repeated sequence on each end and is dispersed through all seven chromosomes of the rye genome. Revolver is transcriptionally active, and the isolated full-length cDNA (726 bp) reveals that Revolver harbors a single gene consisting of three exons (342, 88, and 296 bp) and two introns (750 and 1237 bp), and encodes 139 amino acid residues of protein, which shows similarity to some transcriptional regulators. Revolver variants ranging from 2665 to 4269 bp, in which 5' regions were destructed, indicate structural diversities around the first exon. Revolver does not share identity with any known class I or class II autonomous transposable elements of any living species. DNA blot analysis of Triticeae plants shows that Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat, and has been amplified or lost in several species during the evolution of the Triticeae."

"19442674","abstracttext","To investigate the nature of plant chromosomes irradiated by heavy-ion beams, the effects of nitrogen (N) and neon (Ne) ion beams on hexaploid wheat chromosomes were compared with those of X-ray. Chromosome aberrations, such as short, ring and dicentric chromosomes appeared in high frequency. The average numbers of chromosome breaks at LD-50 by irradiation with X-ray, N and Ne ion beams were 32, 20 and 20, respectively. These values may be underestimated because chromosome rearrangement without change in chromosome morphology was not counted. Thus, we subsequently used a wheat line with a pair of extra chromosomes from an alien species (Leymus racemosus) and observed the fate of the irradiated marker chromosomes by genomic in situ hybridization. This analysis revealed that 50Gy of neon beam induced about eight times more breaks than those induced by X-ray. This result suggests that heavy-ion beams induce chromosome rearrangement in high frequency rather than loss of gene function. This suggests further that most of the novel mutations produced by ion beam irradiation, which have been used in plant breeding, may not be caused by ordinary gene disruption but by chromosome rearrangements."

A gene encoding Arabidopsis thaliana Leaf rust 10 disease-resistance locus receptor-like protein kinase 1 (AtLRK10L1), most closely related to wheat LRK10, expresses two different transcripts, LRK10L1.1 and LRK10L1.2, using alternative promoters.

However, the lrk10l1.2 mutant exhibited reduced tolerance to drought stress, compared with wild type, which is accompanied by alteration of stomatal apertures. The transgenic plants overexpressing full-length LRK10L1.2, which localizes to the plasma membrane (PM) complemented the phenotypes of lrk10l1-2 mutant background, while those expressing LRK10L1.2 Nu1, which switched its localization to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by skipping of a mini-exon, showed even higher ABA insensitivity and drought sensitivity than its mutant background.

To understand the temporal molecular response against this pathogen, microarray gene expression analysis was carried out at two time points on three wheat genotypes, the spikes of which were infected by Fusarium graminearum. The greatest number of genes was upregulated in Nobeokabouzu-komugi followed by Sumai 3, whereas the minimum expression in Gamenya was at three days after inoculation (dai). In Nobeokabouzu-komugi, high expression of detoxification genes, such as multidrug-resistant protein, multidrug resistance-associated protein, UDP-glycosyltransferase and ABC transporters, in addition to systemic defense-related genes, were identified at the early stage of infection. This early response of the highly-resistant genotype implies a different resistance response from the other resistant genotype, Sumai 3, primarily containing local defense-related genes, such as cell wall defense genes. In Gamenya, the expression of all three functional groups was minimal. The differences in these molecular responses with respect to the time points confirmed the variation in the genotypes. For the first time, we report the nature of gene expression in the FHB-highly resistant cv. Nobeokabouzu-komugi during the disease establishment stage and the possible underlying molecular response."
"8589735","articletitle","Adenine methylation at dam sites increases transient gene expression in plant cells."
"8589735","abstracttext","Escherichia coli encodes two major DNA methylation systems: dam, which produces 6-methyladenine; and dcm, which produces 5-methylcytosine. About 1-2% of adenine and cytosine residues in plasmid DNAs prepared in E. coli are methylated by these systems. Since DNA methylation profoundly influences gene expression in eukaryotes, we were interested in determining whether these bacterially encoded modifications might also effect plant gene expression in experimental systems. We therefore examined the influence of dam and dcm methylation on gene expression from four GUS fusion constructs in transient assays in protoplasts and microprojectile-bombarded whole tissues. In these constructs, GUS expression was driven by promoter regions derived from the Arabidopsis alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1), maize ubiquitin (Ubi1), rice actin (Act1) and CaMV 35S genes. We show that methyladenine produced by dam methylation increased gene expression from constructs based on the Adh1, Ubi1 and Act1 genes. The increase in gene expression ranged from three-fold for Ubi1 and Adh1 in protoplasts to 50-fold for Act1 in bombarded wheat tissues. Expression of a 35S.GUS construct was, however, insensitive to dam methylation. dcm methylation had little if any effect on transient gene expression for any of these constructs. We provide indirect evidence that the critical sites of adenine methylation lie within sequences from the promoter regions, suggesting that dam methylation increases transcription rate. These results have important experimental implications and also raise the intriguing possibility that methyladenine might play a role in the regulation of gene expression in vivo."

"15890709","abstracttext","Celiac disease (CD) is a complex genetic disorder of the small intestine. The DQ2/DQ8 human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes explain approximately 40% of the genetic component of the disease, but the remaining non-HLA genes have not yet been identified. The key environmental factor known to be involved in the disease is gluten, a major protein present in wheat, barley, and rye. Integrating microarray data and linkage data from chromosome 6q21-22 revealed the prolyl endopeptidase (PREP) gene as a potential CD candidate in the Dutch population. Interestingly, this gene encodes for the only enzyme that is able to cleave the proline-rich gluten peptides. To investigate the role of the human PREP gene as a primary genetic factor in CD, we conducted gene expression, sequence analysis, and genetic association studies of the PREP gene and determined PREP enzyme activity in biopsies from CD patients and controls. Sequence analysis of the coding region of the PREP gene revealed two novel polymorphisms. Genetic association studies using two novel polymorphisms and three known PREP variants excluded a genetic association between PREP and CD. Determination of PREP activity revealed weak but significant differences between treated and untreated CD biopsies (P < 0.05). Our results from the association study indicate that PREP is not a causative gene for CD in the Dutch population. These are further supported by the activity determinations in which we observed no differences in PREP activity between CD patients and controls."

"14675396","abstracttext","Celiac disease (CD) is a common gastro-intestinal disorder resulting from permanent intolerance to wheat gliadins and related proteins in rye and barley. In addition to the strong genetic association with HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, a genetic region on chromosomes 5 (CELIAC2) has been identified that harbours a susceptibility gene for CD. The gene(s) responsible for this association, however, remains to be identified. In the present study we evaluated polymorphisms in the genes encoding interleukin-12 p40 (IL12B) and interferon regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Both genes are located in the celiac2 region, and have key roles in inducing interferon (IFN)-gamma secreting T helper 1 (Th1) cells, one of the immunological hallmarks of CD. The frequencies of a TaqI gene polymorphism in the 3' UTR of IL12B and a HinfI gene polymorphism in the 3' UTR of IRF1 were studied in 258 Dutch CD patients and 237 ethnically matched healthy controls. The transmission of the polymorphic variants from parents to affected child was determined in 123 families with at least one affected child. The frequencies of the IL12B TaqI gene polymorphism and the IRF1 HinfI gene polymorphism did not differ significantly between patients and controls. In addition, in the family study, no deviation from the expected transmission from parents to affected child of any of the polymorphic variants was found. The IL12B TaqI and the IRF1 HinfI gene polymorphisms do not appear to be involved in susceptibility to CD. Further studies on the factors that drive the Th1 immunopathology in CD are required."

The disease is best controlled using resistant cultivars. Barley genotype Grannenlose Zweizeilige (GZ) has a recessive gene (rpsGZ) that is effective against all races of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei identified so far in the USA. To develop a molecular map for mapping the gene, F(8 )recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from the Steptoe X GZ cross through single-seed descent. Seedlings of the parents and RILs were evaluated for resistance to races PSH-14 and PSH-54 of P. striiformis f. sp. hordei under controlled greenhouse conditions. Genomic DNA was extracted from the parents and 182 F(8 )RILs and used for linkage analysis. The resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) technique was used to identify molecular markers for rpsGZ. A linkage group for the gene was constructed with 12 RGAP markers, of which two markers co-segregated with the resistance locus, and two markers were closely linked to the locus with a genetic distance of 0.9 and 2.0 cM, respectively. These four markers were present only in the susceptible parent. The closest marker to the resistance allele was 11.7 cM away. Analyses of two sets of barley chromosome addition lines of wheat with the two RGAP markers that were cosegregating with the susceptibility allele showed that rpsGZ and the markers were located on the long arm of barley chromosome 4H. Further, tests with four simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers confirmed the chromosomal location of the rpsGZ gene and also integrated the RGAP markers into the known SSR-based linkage map of barley. The closest SSR marker EBmac0679 had a genetic distance of 7.5 cM with the gene in the integrated linkage map constructed with the 12 RGAP markers and 4 SSR markers. The information on chromosomal location and molecular markers for rpsGZ should be useful for incorporating this gene into commercial cultivars and combining it with other resistance genes for durable resistance."
"20005003","articletitle","NAM-1gene polymorphism and grain protein content in Hordeum."
"20005003","abstracttext","Grain protein content (GPC) is a key quality factor for malting and brewing process. In wheat, a QTL explaining a large part of GPC variation was identified, which co-localizes with a gene encoding a NAC transcription factor (TtNAM-B1). NAC transcription factors influence GPC by their role in the regulation of senescence and in protein remobilization. An orthologous gene was discovered on barley chromosome 6H where a GPC QTL was mapped. In this study, we identify allelic variation of the NAM-1 gene for three species of Hordeum representing wild and cultivated barley and we investigate the possible link with GPC. Three haplotypes were identified, one corresponds to the sequences of 11 European varieties representing H. vulgare, one corresponds to the sequence found in H. spontaneum and one represents the sequence of H. bulbosum. Three SNPs were identified between H. spontaneum sequence and H. vulgare sequence. One of the H. bulbosum polymorphisms leads to the introduction of a stop codon and a non-functional protein. Differences in GPC between the 11 varieties were found but no polymorphism in the NAM-1 gene was observed, suggesting that differences in expression of the HvNAM-1 gene or other genes should play a role in GPC regulation. Nevertheless based on published values for GPC of H. bulbosum and H. spontaneum compared to GPC measured here in H. vulgare, the non-functional protein is associated with the lower GPC, suggesting that loss of functionality of the NAM-1 gene in Hordeum is related to lower GPC. Moreover H. spontaneum GPC seems to be higher than H. vulgare GPC, suggesting also that allelic variation of the functional NAM-1 gene could be associated with GPC variation within the genus Hordeum."

"21897874","abstracttext","Genome-wide analysis has documented differential gene expression between closely related species in plants and animals and nonadditive gene expression in hybrids and allopolyploids compared to the parents. In Arabidopsis, 15-43% of genes are expressed differently between the related species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, the majority of which are nonadditively expressed (differently from mid-parent value) in allotetraploids. Nonadditive gene expression can be caused by transcriptional regulation through chromatin modifications, but the role of posttranscriptional regulation in nonadditive gene expression is largely unknown. Here we reported genome-wide analysis of mRNA decay in resynthesized Arabidopsis allotetraploids. Among ∼26,000 annotated genes, over 1% of gene transcripts showed rapid decay with an estimated half-life of less than 60 minutes, and they are called allotetraploid genes with unstable transcripts (AlloGUTs). Remarkably, 30% of alloGUTs matched the nonadditively expressed genes, and their expression levels were negatively correlated with the decay rate. Compared to all genes, these nonadditively expressed alloGUTs were overrepresented 2-6-fold in the Gene Ontology (GOSlim) classifications in response to abiotic and biotic stresses, signal transduction, and transcription. Interestingly, the AlloGUTs include transcription factor genes that are highly inducible under stress conditions and circadian clock regulators that regulate growth in A. thaliana. These data suggest a role of mRNA stability in homoeologous gene expression in Arabidopsis allopolyploids. The enrichment of nonadditively expressed genes in stress-related pathways were commonly observed in Arabidopsis and other allopolyploids such as wheat and cotton, which may suggest a role for stress-mediated growth vigor in hybrids and allopolyploids."
"21882709","articletitle","No fitness cost for wheat's H gene-mediated resistance to Hessian fly (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae)."
"21882709","abstracttext","Resistance (R) genes have a proven record for protecting plants against biotic stress. A problem is parasite adaptation via Avirulence (Avr) mutations, which allows the parasite to colonize the R gene plant. Scientists hope to make R genes more durable by stacking them in a single cultivar. However, stacking assumes that R gene-mediated resistance has no fitness cost for the plant. We tested this assumption for wheat's resistance to Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae). Our study included ten plant fitness measures and four wheat genotypes, one susceptible, and three expressing either the H6, H9, or H13 resistance gene. Because R gene-mediated resistance has two components, we measured two types of costs: the cost of the constitutively-expressed H gene, which functions in plant surveillance, and the cost of the downstream induced responses, which were triggered by Hessian fly larvae rather than a chemical elicitor. For the constitutively expressed Hgene, some measures indicated costs, but a greater number of measures indicated benefits of simply expressing the H gene. For the induced resistance, instead of costs, resistant plants showed benefits of being attacked. Resistant plants were more likely to survive attack than susceptible plants, and surviving resistant plants produced higher yield and quality. We discuss why resistance to the Hessian fly has little or no cost and propose that tolerance is important, with compensatory growth occurring after H gene-mediated resistance kills the larva. We end with a caution: Given that plants were given good growing conditions, fitness costs may be found under conditions of greater biotic or abiotic stress."

Their biosynthesis involves nine enzymes thought to form a linear pathway leading to the storage of DI(M)BOA as glucoside conjugates. Seven of the genes (Bx1-Bx6 and Bx8) form a cluster at the tip of the short arm of maize chromosome 4 that includes four P450 genes (Bx2-5) belonging to the same CYP71C subfamily. The origin of this cluster is unknown."
"22577841","abstracttext_results","We show that the pathway appeared following several duplications of the TSA gene (α-subunit of tryptophan synthase) and of a Bx2-like ancestral CYP71C gene and the recruitment of Bx8 before the radiation of Poaceae. The origins of Bx6 and Bx7 remain unclear. We demonstrate that the Bx2-like CYP71C ancestor was not committed to the benzoxazinoid pathway and that after duplications the Bx2-Bx5 genes were under positive selection on a few sites and underwent functional divergence, leading to the current specific biochemical properties of the enzymes. The absence of synteny between available Poaceae genomes involving the Bx gene regions is in contrast with the conserved synteny in the TSA gene region."
"22577841","abstracttext_conclusions","These results demonstrate that rearrangements following duplications of an IGL/TSA gene and of a CYP71C gene probably resulted in the clustering of the new copies (Bx1 and Bx2) at the tip of a chromosome in an ancestor of grasses. Clustering favored cosegregation and tip chromosomal location favored gene rearrangements that allowed the further recruitment of genes to the pathway. These events, a founding event and elongation events, may have been the key to the subsequent evolution of the benzoxazinoid biosynthetic cluster."

"21430247","abstracttext","Proximal colon epithelial gene responses to diets containing increasing levels of dietary fermentable material (FM) from 2 different sources were measured to determine whether gene expression patterns were independent of the source of FM. Male Fischer 344 rats (10/group) were fed for 6 wk a control diet containing 10% (g/g) cellulose (0% FM); or a 2, 5, or 10% wheat bran (WB) diet (1, 2, 5% FM); or a 2, 5, or 8% fructooligosaccharides (FOS) diet (2, 5, 8% FM). WB and FOS were substituted for cellulose to give a final 10% nondigestible material content including FM. Gene responses were relative to expression in rats fed the control diet. The gene response patterns associated with feeding ∼2% FM (5% WB and 2% FOS) were similar (∼10 gene changes ≥ 1.6-fold; P ≤ 0.01) and involved genes associated with transport (Scnn1g, Mt1a), transcription (Zbtb16, Egr1), immunity (Fkbp5), a gut hormone (Retn1β), and lipid metabolism (Scd2, Insig1). These changes were also similar to those associated with 5% FM but only in rats fed the 10% WB diet. In contrast, the 5% FOS diet (~5% FM) was associated with 68 gene expression changes ≥ 1.6-fold (P ≤ 0.01). The diet with the highest level of fermentation (8% FOS, ~8% FM) was associated with 132 changes ≥ 1.6-fold (P ≤ 0.01), including genes associated with transport, cellular proliferation, oncogene and tumor metastasis, the cell cycle, apoptosis, signal transduction, transcript regulation, immunity, gut hormones, and lipid metabolic processes. These results show that both the amount and source of FM determine proximal colon epithelial gene response patterns in rats."

"23216085","abstracttext","The rpg4 gene confers recessive resistance to several races of wheat stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) and Rpg5 provides dominant resistance against isolates of the rye stem rust (P. graminis f. sp. secalis) in barley. The rpg4 and Rpg5 genes are tightly linked on chromosome 5H, and positional cloning using high-resolution populations clearly separated the genes, unambiguously identifying Rpg5; however, the identity of rpg4 remained unclear. High-resolution genotyping of critical recombinants at the rpg4/Rpg5 locus, designated here as rpg4-mediated resistance locus (RMRL) delimited two distinct yet tightly linked loci required for resistance, designated as RMRL1 and RMRL2. Utilizing virus-induced gene silencing, each gene at RMRL1, i.e., HvRga1 (a nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat [NBS-LRR] domain gene), Rpg5 (an NBS-LRR-protein kinase domain gene), and HvAdf3 (an actin depolymerizing factor-like gene), was individually silenced followed by inoculation with P. graminis f. sp. tritici race QCCJ. Silencing each gene changed the reaction type from incompatible to compatible, indicating that all three genes are required for rpg4-mediated resistance. This stem rust resistance mechanism in barley follows the emerging theme of unrelated pairs of genetically linked NBS-LRR genes required for specific pathogen recognition and resistance. It also appears that actin cytoskeleton dynamics may play an important role in determining resistance against several races of stem rust in barley."

Orthologous genes were identified in Pgt and local conservation of gene order (microsynteny) was observed. Pairwise protein identities ranged from 26 to 99%. One Pt BAC, containing a RAD18 ortholog, shares syntenic regions with two Pgt scaffolds, which could represent both haplotypes of Pgt. Gene sequence is diverged between the species as well as within the two haplotypes. In all three BAC clones, gene order is locally conserved, however, gene shuffling has occurred relative to Pgt. These regions are further diverged by differing insertion loci of LTR-retrotransposon, Gypsy, Copia, Mutator, and Harbinger mobile elements. Uncharacterized Pt open reading frames were also found; these proteins are high in lysine and similar to multiple proteins in Pgt."

"26149652","articletitle","Whole-genome expression analysis of Rice black-streaked dwarf virus in different plant hosts and small brown planthopper."
"26149652","abstracttext","Rice black-streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) can infect a number of gramineous plants and cause severe crop yield losses in southeast Asian countries. The virus is transmitted by small brown planthopper (SBPH) in a persistent circulative manner. The interactions between RBSDV and its different hosts remain unknown. Besides, how the virus adjusts itself to infect different hosts is unclear. In the present study, the relative RNA levels of the thirteen RBSDV genes in rice, maize, wheat, and SBPH were measured by real-time quantitative PCR. P7-1 and P10 genes were predominantly expressed whereas P8 and P7-2 genes were expressed at low levels in plant hosts. Similar to the expression in rice, P7-1 was the most abundantly expressed gene and P8 was expressed at the lowest level in SBPH, indicating that RBSDV adopts the same strategy to infect distinct hosts. The high expression levels of the P7-1 gene in both plants and insect suggest that it can be used as the target gene for disease diagnostics. However, the expression levels of some genes varied from host to host. P5-1, P6 and P9-1, the components of the RBSDV viroplasm, are differentially expressed in different hosts. Moreover, western blot analysis showed that the quantity of the P9-1 protein was more abundant in SBPH than in plant hosts. These data indicate that the virus may adjust its own gene expression to replicate in different hosts. Analysis of time course of gene expression revealed that P7-1 stands out as the only gene highly expressed at the earliest time point and its expression precedes all others throughout infection from 8 to 24days post-inoculation. The high expression levels of the P7-1 gene suggest that it plays a significant role in RBSDV-host interactions."

"21876527","abstracttext","Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) is one of the most important crops worldwide. Considerable efforts have been made on molecular breeding of new varieties. The large-scale gene functional analysis in cotton has been lagged behind most of the modern plant species, likely due to its large size of genome, gene duplication and polyploidy, long growth cycle and recalcitrance to genetic transformation(1). To facilitate high throughput functional genetic/genomic study in cotton, we attempt to develop rapid and efficient transient assays to assess cotton gene functions. Virus-Induced Gene Silencing (VIGS) is a powerful technique that was developed based on the host Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS) to repress viral proliferation(2,3). Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS has been successfully applied in a wide range of dicots species such as Solanaceae, Arabidopsis and legume species, and monocots species including barley, wheat and maize, for various functional genomic studies(3,4). As this rapid and efficient approach avoids plant transformation and overcomes functional redundancy, it is particularly attractive and suitable for functional genomic study in crop species like cotton not amenable for transformation. In this study, we report the detailed protocol of Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS system in cotton. Among the several viral VIGS vectors, the tobacco rattle virus (TRV) invades a wide range of hosts and is able to spread vigorously throughout the entire plant yet produce mild symptoms on the hosts5. To monitor the silencing efficiency, GrCLA1, a homolog gene of Arabidopsis Cloroplastos alterados 1 gene (AtCLA1) in cotton, has been cloned and inserted into the VIGS binary vector pYL156. CLA1 gene is involved in chloroplast development(6), and previous studies have shown that loss-of-function of AtCLA1 resulted in an albino phenotype on true leaves(7), providing an excellent visual marker for silencing efficiency. At approximately two weeks post Agrobacterium infiltration, the albino phenotype started to appear on the true leaves, with 100% silencing efficiency in all replicated experiments. The silencing of endogenous gene expression was also confirmed by RT-PCR analysis. Significantly, silencing could potently occur in all the cultivars we tested, including various commercially grown varieties in Texas. This rapid and efficient Agrobacterium-mediated VIGS assay provides a very powerful tool for rapid large-scale analysis of gene functions at genome-wide level in cotton."

"28832276","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is considered the best approach to manage this disease. In order to identify the resistance gene(s) in wheat line 03031-1-5 H62, which displayed high resistance to stripe rust at adult plant stage, a cross was made between 03031-1-5 H62 and susceptible cultivar Avocet S. The mapping population was tested with Chinese P. striiformis f. sp. tritici race CYR32 through artificial inoculation in a field in Yangling, Shaanxi Province and under natural infection in Tianshui, Gansu Province. The segregation ratios indicated that the resistance was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated as YrH62. A combination of bulked segregant analysis (BSA) with wheat 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array was used to identify molecular markers linked to YrH62. A total of 376 polymorphic SNP loci identified from the BSA analysis were located on chromosome 1B, from which 35 kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers selected together with 84 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers on 1B were used to screen polymorphism and a chromosome region associated with rust resistance was identified. To saturate the chromosomal region covering the YrH62 locus, a 660K SNP array was used to identify more SNP markers. To develop tightly linked markers for marker-assisted selection of YrH62 in wheat breeding, 18 SNPs were converted into KASP markers. A final linkage map consisting of 15 KASP and 3 SSR markers was constructed with KASP markers AX-109352427 and AX-109862469 flanking the YrH62 locus in a 1.0 cM interval. YrH62 explained 63.8 and 69.3% of the phenotypic variation for disease severity and infection type, respectively. YrH62 was located near the centromeric region of chromosome 1BS based on the positions of the SSR markers in 1B deletion bins. Based on the origin, responses to P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races, and marker distances, YrH62 is likely different from the other reported stripe rust resistance genes/quantitative trait loci on 1B. The gene and tightly linked KASP markers will be useful for breeding wheat cultivars with resistance to stripe rust."

However the endpoints of all three inversions are all adjacent to at least one tRNA gene, and there is evidence that three of the tRNA genes have been subjected to partial duplication, possibly at the time of inversion. This suggests that tRNA genes might be involved with rearrangements of chloroplast DNA, as has also been postulated for mitochondrial DNA."

"5277070","abstracttext","Infection of BALB/3T3 cells by polyoma virus causes an alteration in the cell surface, characterized by enhanced agglutination of the cells by wheat germ agglutinin or concanavalin A. Infection by the thermosensitive mutant of polyoma, ts-3, causes the cell surface alteration at the permissive temperature, but not at the nonpermissive temperature. The cell surface alteration requires cellular DNA synthesis, but not viral DNA synthesis. BHK cells transformed by ts-3 show the surface alteration when grown at the permissive temperature, but not when grown at the nonpermissive temperature. It is concluded that the surface alteration in transformed cells is under the control of a viral gene."

"7653102","abstracttext","The phosphoprotein (P) gene of two subgroup A strains of avian pneumovirus comprised 855 nucleotides containing only one substantial open reading frame encoding a protein of 278 amino acids, with a predicted M(r) of 30,323. In vitro translation of P mRNA in a wheat germ system resulted in the synthesis of two polypeptides of M(r) 35,000. Comparison of the deduced P protein sequence with that of the known mammalian pneumoviruses revealed overall amino acid identities ranging from 31 to 34.5%, suggesting a distant relationship. However, there was a much higher identity (63.2-68.4%) in a region of 57 residues, which included a heptad repeat sequence."
"8315657","articletitle","Fine structure and evolution of the rDNA intergenic spacer in rice and other cereals."
"8315657","abstracttext","The intergenic spacer of a rice ribosomal RNA gene repeating unit has been completely sequenced. The spacer contains three imperfect, direct repeated regions of 264-253 bp, followed by a related but more highly divergent region. Detailed analysis of the sequence allows the presentation of an evolutionary scenario in which the 264-253-bp repeats are derived from an ancestral 150-bp sequence by deletion and amplification. Comparison of the rice sequence with those of maize, wheat, and rye shows that, despite considerable divergence from the ancestral sequence, several regions have been highly conserved, suggesting that they may play an important role in the structure and/or expression of the ribosomal genes."

"8851798","abstracttext","The satellite sequence studied was primarily composed of GAA repeats organized in long tracts of heterochromatic DNA. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) with the GAA satellite (GAA banding) to the chromosomes of barley, wheat, rye, and other Triticeae species produced banding patterns similar to those obtained by N-banding. The GAA-banding patterns of barley are described in detail and those of 12 other Triticeae species are described briefly. In situ hybridization with the GAA-satellite sequence permits identification of all the chromosomes of barley. It is a valuable alternative to other banding techniques, especially in connection with physical gene mapping by FISH. The application of the GAA-satellite sequence for the characterization of genomes in phylogenetic studies of genera containing the sequence is discussed."

Genes for trnN, trnM, trnS-GGA, trnW and trnH are of the 'chloroplast-like' type and presumably originate from promiscuous chloroplast (cp) DNA sequences inserted into the petunia mitochondrial genome. A comparison of the mt tRNAs or tRNA genes population present in two monocotyledonous plants (wheat and maize) and two dicotyledonous plants (petunia and potato) show slight differences in the genetic origin of individual tRNAs. The organization of the petunia mt tRNA genes as well as the number of tRNA gene copies, compared to other plant species, is discussed."

This sequence is conserved in other dicot plants such as Oenothera, pea and sunflower, but is not detected in wheat mitochondrial DNA. The Arabidopsis, sunflower and Oenothera sequences may be pseudogenes, with the first two being shortened by stop codons and transcription of the latter terminating within the orf. However, RNA editing increases the similarity to homologous Marchantia, algal and bacterial polypeptides, suggesting that this orf could code for the complex-II membrane-anchor subunit (SDH4) in at least some higher-plant species."

"10322543","abstracttext","Dinitroaniline herbicides have been used for pre-emergence weed control for the past 25 years in cotton, soybean, wheat and oilseed crops. Considering their long persistence and extensive use, resistance to dinitroanilines is fairly rare. However, the most widespread dinitroaniline-resistant weeds, the highly resistant (R) and the intermediate (I) biotypes of the invasive goosegrass Eleusine indica, are now infesting more than 1000 cotton fields in the southern states of the USA. The molecular basis of this resistance has been identified, and found to be a point mutation in a major microtubule cytoskeletal protein, alpha-tubulin. These studies have served both to explain the establishment of resistance and to reveal fundamental properties of tubulin gene expression and microtubule structure."

"10500139","abstracttext","Genetic transformation of plants often results in multiple copies of the introduced DNA at a single locus. To ensure that only a single copy of a foreign gene resides in the plant genome, we used a strategy based on site-specific recombination. The transformation vector consists of a transgene flanked by recombination sites in an inverted orientation. Regardless of the number of copies integrated between the outermost transgenes, recombination between the outermost sites resolves the integrated molecules into a single copy. An example of this strategy has been demonstrated with wheat transformation, where four of four multiple-copy loci were resolved successfully into single-copy transgenes."

"12387887","abstracttext","In wheat, non-phosphorylating, NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPN) was found to be encoded by one gene giving rise to a single protein. However, Western blots revealed two different subunits of about 58 and 60 kDa in endosperm and shoots. The latter was attributed to in vivo phosphorylation of shoot GAPN. No modification occurred in leaves, where the enzyme is composed by a single 58 kDa polypeptide. GAPN partially purified from shoots and endosperm was dephosphorylated in vitro with alkaline phosphatase. Phosphorylated GAPN exhibited similar affinity for substrates but a lower V(max) compared to the non-phosphorylated enzyme. Results suggest that reversible phosphorylation of GAPN could regulate NADPH production in the cytosol of heterotrophic plant cells."

Although this capability is having an impact on the conduct of large breeding programmes, a much more profound change in breeding strategy will become possible when SNP technology has matured sufficiently so that the throughput of molecular marker-based genotyping will be able to keep pace with the numbers of plants that breeders can handle in the field. We discuss the considerations that will need to be addressed in the generation of a new breeding paradigm to take advantage of the genomics revolution."

While one fragment shows homology to fungal class IV chitin synthases, the other fragment groups with other oomycete chitin synthases to form a novel class of chitin synthases most closely related to class I-III. RT-PCR experiments indicate that PvCHS1 is constitutively expressed, whereas PvCHS2 is specifically transcribed in sporangiophores and sporangia. Analyses of wheat germ agglutinin labeling patterns by confocal laser scanning microscopy show that chitin is present on the surface of hyphal cell walls during in planta growth, and of sporangiophores and sporangia."

"16510517","abstracttext","This review describes physiological mechanisms and selectable indicators of gene action, with the aim of promoting new screening methods to identify genetic variation for increasing the salt tolerance of cereal crops. Physiological mechanisms that underlie traits for salt tolerance could be used to identify new genetic sources of salt tolerance. Important mechanisms of tolerance involve Na+ exclusion from the transpiration stream, sequestration of Na+ and Cl- in the vacuoles of root and leaf cells, and other processes that promote fast growth despite the osmotic stress of the salt outside the roots. Screening methods for these traits are discussed in relation to their use in breeding, particularly with respect to wheat. Precise phenotyping is the key to finding and introducing new genes for salt tolerance into crop plants."

"16791696","abstracttext","This study describes the development of a PCR marker to detect the beta-amylase-R1 gene of rye. It provides an easy and rapid means for the identification of plants containing the beta-amylase-R1. Because rye chromosome segments do not normally recombine with wheat chromosomes, this marker provides a means for tracking all linked genes on that alien 5RL chromosome segment. Reaction conditions were optimised for an annealing temperature of 60 degrees C for a high stringency. The reaction was also optimised for low reaction volumes reducing the cost of the reagents required for the reaction. This PCR test can be used in breeding or mapping programs for the rapid screening of progeny containing translocations of 5RL and hence select for the copper efficiency trait of rye."

LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) genes are believed to confer resistance to drought and water deficiency. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, a wheat LEA gene, TaLEA(3), was integrated into L. chinensis. The transgenic lines showed enhanced growth ability under drought stress during which transgenic lines had increased the relative water content, leaf water potential, relative average growth rate, but decreased the malondialdehyde content compared with the non-transgenic plant. Thus, transgenic breeding is an efficient approach to enhance drought tolerance in L. chinensis."

"16911209","abstracttext","The global migration patterns of the fungal wheat pathogen Phaeosphaeria nodorum were analysed using 12 microsatellite loci. Analysis of 693 isolates from nine populations indicated that the population structure of P. nodorum is characterized by high levels of genetic diversity and a low degree of subdivision between continents. To determine whether genetic similarity of populations was a result of recent divergence or extensive gene flow, the microsatellite data were analysed using an isolation-with-migration model. We found that the continental P. nodorum populations diverged recently, but that enough migration occurred to reduce population differentiation. The migration patterns of the pathogen indicate that immigrants originated mainly from populations in Europe, China and North America."

Nucleotide sequence alignment of these genes with previously reported genes of Pseudomonas sp. strain ACP and Enterobacter cloacae strain UW4 showed variation in their sequences. In the phylogenetic analysis, distinctness of these two genes was observed as a separate cluster. 16S rDNA sequencing of two isolates identified them to be Achromobacter sp. and Pseudomonas stutzeri."

"17426955","abstracttext","Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity is highly related to the undesirable browning of wheat-based end products, especially Asian noodles. Characterization of PPO genes and the development of their functional markers are of great importance for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. In the present study, complete genomic DNA sequences of two PPO genes, one each located on chromosomes 2A and 2D and their allelic variants were characterized by means of in silico cloning and experimental validation. Sequences were aligned at both DNA and protein levels. Two haplotypes on chromosome 2D showed 95.2% sequence identity at the DNA level, indicating much more sequence diversity than those on chromosome 2A with 99.6% sequence identity. Both of the PPO genes on chromosomes 2A and 2D contain an open reading frame (ORF) of 1,731 bp, encoding a PPO precursor peptide of 577 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 64 kD. Two complementary dominant STS markers, PPO16 and PPO29, were developed based on the PPO gene haplotypes located on chromosome 2D; they amplify a 713-bp fragment in cultivars with low PPO activity and a 490-bp fragment in those with high PPO activity, respectively. The two markers were mapped on chromosome 2DL using a doubled haploid population derived from the cross Zhongyou 9507/CA9632, and a set of nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and ditelosomic line 2DS of Chinese Spring. QTL analysis indicated that the PPO gene co-segregated with the two STS markers and was closely linked to SSR marker Xwmc41 on chromosome 2DL, explaining from 9.6 to 24.4% of the phenotypic variance for PPO activity across three environments. In order to simultaneously detect PPO loci on chromosomes 2A and 2D, a multiplexed marker combination PPO33/PPO16 was developed and yielded distinguishable DNA patterns in a number of cultivars. The STS marker PPO33 for the PPO gene on chromosome 2A was developed from the same gene sequences as PPO18 that we reported previously, and can amplify a 481-bp and a 290-bp fragment from cultivars with low and high PPO activity, respectively. A total of 217 Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines were used to validate the association between the polymorphic fragments and grain PPO activity. The results showed that the marker combination PPO33/PPO16 is efficient and reliable for evaluating PPO activity and can be used in wheat breeding programs aimed for noodle and other end product quality improvement."

The primers and probe were designed based on published methods. The method provided positive results for walnut and negative results for other tested agricultural plant materials including pecan. The intrinsic detection limit of the method was 0.00125 ng of walnut DNA, and the practical detection limit was 0.001% (wt/wt) walnut content in wheat; both of these values are lower than that of previously published methods. Therefore, this real-time PCR method is sufficiently specific and sensitive for the detection of walnut component in food."

The lack of segregation of the resistance trait in progeny from reciprocal crosses between lines H-93-70 and VPM1 indicates that their respective resistance factors are allelic. Line H-93-51 carries the endopeptidase allele Ep-D1b but is susceptible to eyespot, which indicates that resistance to eyespot is not a product of the Ep-D locus, as had been proposed in a previous hypohesis."

In the present study, the existing full-length cDNA of this member was used as a basis to query the International Wheat Genome Survey Sequence to identify all members of the TaHKT2;1 family. Individual TaHKT2;1 genes were subsequently studied for gene and predicted protein structures, promoter variability, tissue expression and their role in Na(+) and K(+) status of wheat."

Variability in protein domains for cation specificity and in cis-regulatory elements for salt response in gene promoters, were identified amongst the functional TaHKT2;1 members. The functional genes were expressed under low and high NaCl conditions in roots and leaf sheaths, but were down regulated in leaf blades. Alternative splicing events were evident in TaHKT2;1 7AL-1. Aneuploid lines null for each functional gene were grown in high NaCl nutrient solution culture to identify potential role of each TaHKT2;1 member. Aneuploid lines null for TaHKT2;1 7AL-1, TaHKT2;1 7BL-1 and TaHKT2;1 7BL-2 showed no difference in Na(+) concentration between Chinese Spring except for higher Na(+) in sheaths. The same aneuploid lines had lower K(+) in roots, sheath and youngest fully expanded leaf but only under high (200 mM) NaCl in the external solution. There was no difference in Na(+) or K(+) concentration for any treatment between aneuploid line null for the TaHKT2;1 7DL-1 gene and Chinese Spring."

They are the most studied of the monocots due to their tremendous agricultural and agronomic importance."

"26484271","abstracttext","To date, only a few conserved miRNAs have been predicted in hexaploid (AABBDD) bread wheat and till now community behavior among miRNA is still in dark. Analysis of publically available 1287279 ESTs from NCBI resulted 262 putative pre-miRNAs and 39 novel mature miRNAs. A total 22,468 targets were identified on 21 chromosomes. MiRNA target community was identified for genomes with different levels of cross talks. Gene ontology of these community targets suggests their differential involvement in different metabolisms along with common and stringent involvement in nitrogen metabolism."

"27074578","abstracttext","This study established a wheat transcriptome library using RH8706-49 and RH8706-34. Salt-induced differential genes were screened by Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). Five differential genes were chosen to study the functions by combining transcript sequencing result and gene chip. The expression changes of these five differential genes were analyzed using real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) technique to determine the reliability and accuracy of transcriptome sequencing and transplanted into Arabidopsis thaliana to obtain transgenic homozygote plants for the salt tolerance test. The salt tolerance test results show that the transgenic plants grew far better than the wild-type plant."

"27819043","abstracttext","Necrotrophic pathogens live and feed on dying tissue, but their interactions with plants are not well understood compared to biotrophic pathogens. The wheat Snn1 gene confers susceptibility to strains of the necrotrophic pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum that produce the SnTox1 protein. We report the positional cloning of Snn1 , a member of the wall-associated kinase class of receptors, which are known to drive pathways for biotrophic pathogen resistance. Recognition of SnTox1 by Snn1 activates programmed cell death, which allows this necrotroph to gain nutrients and sporulate. These results demonstrate that necrotrophic pathogens such as P. nodorum hijack host molecular pathways that are typically involved in resistance to biotrophic pathogens, revealing the complex nature of susceptibility and resistance in necrotrophic and biotrophic pathogen interactions with plants."

"29807545","abstracttext","Nucleotide base editors in plants have been limited to conversion of cytosine to thymine. Here, we describe a new plant adenine base editor based on an evolved tRNA adenosine deaminase fused to the nickase CRISPR/Cas9, enabling A•T to G•C conversion at frequencies up to 7.5% in protoplasts and 59.1% in regenerated rice and wheat plants. An endogenous gene is also successfully modified through introducing a gain-of-function point mutation to directly produce an herbicide-tolerant rice plant. With this new adenine base editing system, it is now possible to precisely edit all base pairs, thus expanding the toolset for precise editing in plants."

"30743470","abstracttext","Durum wheat cv. Creso has been mentioned as having durable resistance to leaf rust (2-4). However, an average final disease level of 70S on the modified Cobb scale was scored on Creso across three locations in inoculated field trials in France during 2009. A mixture of two durum wheat leaf rust isolates commonly found in France was used for the inoculation, one was virulent on Lr23 and the other was avirulent on this gene, their identical avirulence/virulence formula for other genes was Lr1, 2a, 2b, 3, 3bg, 3ka, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 24, 25, 26, 27+31/Lr2c, 10, 14a, 14b, 20, 21, 33, and 44. On cv. Llareta Inia and breeding line Somateria, both of which carry the resistance gene Lr14a, the average final disease level was, respectively, 95S and 80S. Creso, Llareta Inia, and Somateria displayed average final disease levels of, respectively, 0, 10S, and 1 in field trials inoculated with race CBG/BP in 2009 at two locations in Mexico (Ciudad Obregon and El Batan). Race CBG/BP, virulent on Lr3, 10, 11, 14b, 20, 23, 27 + 31, and 33, is the most widely virulent race identified so far in Mexico where Lr14a remains effective for durum wheat. Virulence for Lr14a in durum wheat leaf rust populations was already mentioned to be present in France since 2000 (1). It has been suggested that the resistance of Creso, which has remained durable in Italy since 1975 (4), could be due to a gene close to but different from Lr14a. Alternatively, the fact that Creso's reaction was significantly lower than those of Llareta Inia or Somateria could indicate the presence of another gene, of minor effect, in addition to Lr14a. Whatever the genetic basis of the Creso resistance may be, it has been overcome by common French pathotypes and its usefulness in breeding, at a regional if not global level, has become questionable.

"3320051","abstracttext","A processing activity has been identified in higher plant chloroplasts that cleaves the precursor of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP). A wheat LHCP gene previously characterized (Lamppa, G.K., G. Morelli, and N.-H. Chua, 1985. Mol. Cell Biol. 5:1370-1378) was used to synthesize RNA and subsequently the labeled precursor polypeptide in vitro. Incubation of the LHCP precursors with a soluble extract from lysed chloroplasts, after removal of the thylakoids and membrane vesicles, resulted in the release of a single 25-kD peptide. In contrast, when the LHCP precursors were used in an import reaction with intact pea or wheat chloroplasts, two forms (25 and 26 kD) of mature LHCP were found. The peptide released by the processing activity in the organelle-free assay comigrated with the lower molecular mass form of mature LHCP produced during import. Properties of the processing activity suggest that it is an endopeptidase. Chloroplasts from both pea and wheat, two divergent higher plants, contain the processing enzyme, suggesting its physiological importance in LHCP assembly into the thylakoids. We discuss the implications of LHCP precursor processing by a soluble enzyme that may be in the stromal compartment."

"7646034","abstracttext","We report here significant phenotypic and genetic differences between Azospirillum brasilense Sp7 and spontaneous mutant Sp7-S and their related properties in association with wheat. In contrast to the wild-type strain of Sp7, colonies of Sp7-S stained weakly with Congo red when grown on agar media containing the dye and did not flocculate in the presence of fructose and nitrate. Scanning and transmission electron micrographs showed clearly that the Sp7-S strain lacked surface materials present as a thick layer on the surface of the wild-type Sp7 strain. Different patterns of colonization on wheat roots between Sp7 and Sp7-S, revealed by in situ studies using nifA-lacZ as a reporter gene, were related to a large increase in nitrogenase activity (acetylene reduction) with Sp7-S in association with normal and 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid-treated wheat for assays conducted under conditions in which the nitrogenase activity of free-living Azospirillum organisms was inhibited by an excess of oxygen. Randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis indicated the close genetic relationship of Sp7-S to several other sources of Sp7, by comparison to other recognized strains of A. brasilense. Genetic complementation of Sp7-S was achieved with a 9.4-kb fragment of DNA cloned from wild-type Sp7, restoring Congo red staining and flocculation."

"6895897","abstracttext","In the search for the biochemical basis of the control of glycosylation of cell surface carbohydrates, revertant clones were isolated from previously characterized wheat germ agglutinin-resistant clones of B16 mouse melanoma cells by selection for resistance to Lotus tetragonolobus lectin or to ricin. Comparison of the wheat germ agglutinin-resistant clones with the parent and revertant clones indicated that this phenotype was correlated with an increased sensitivity to the Lotus lectin, a 60- to 70-fold increase in alpha 1 leads to 3 fucosyltransferase activity and a decreased sialic acid content of the N-glycosidic chains of glycoproteins. The results suggest a novel type of control mechanism for lectin resistance, an increase in a glycosyltransferase activity. The presence of alpha 1 leads to 3 bound fucose on N-acetylglucosamine residues would interfere with the addition of sialic acid by alpha 2 leads to 3 linkages to galactose residues in the carbohydrate units, and this change could explain the resistance to wheat germ agglutinin and the increased sensitivity to the Lotus lectin. A change in a regulatory gene for the fucosyltransferase as a possible primary cause for the changed phenotype is discussed."
"8541492","articletitle","Molecular cloning and expression analysis of peroxidase genes from wheat."
"8541492","abstracttext","A PCR-based screening approach was used to isolate genomic clones from wheat encoding peroxidase isozymes. Three complete genes (pox1, pox2 and pox4) and one truncated gene (pox3) were characterized. The nucleotide sequences predicted mature proteins of 31 kDa, in which all the highly conserved motifs of secreted plant peroxidases were preserved. The coding regions showed 73-83% DNA sequence identity, with the highest level of similarity noted for the tandemly oriented pox2 and pox3. Expression of respective pox genes in various tissues of wheat was assessed by the RT-PCR technique, which showed that all four genes are active. The primary pox1 mRNA was spliced to remove three introns, whereas processing of the other pox transcripts involved only two intervening sequences. Splicing occurred at consensus GU/AG splice sites except for the first introns of pox1, pox2 and pox4 transcripts, where processing took place at unusual GC donor sites. The RNA analysis suggested that the pox1, pox2 and pox4 genes are predominantly expressed in roots. Lower levels of expression were found for pox4 and pox3 in leaves. Infection of wheat by the powdery mildew fungus selectively induced expression of pox2 in leaves."

"9763416","abstracttext","We have determined the relationship between overall nuclear architecture, chromosome territories, and transcription sites within the nucleus, using three-dimensional confocal microscopy of well preserved tissue sections of wheat roots. Chromosome territories were visualized by GISH using rye genomic probe in wheat/rye translocation and addition lines. The chromosomes appeared as elongated regions and showed a clear centromere-telomere polarization, with the two visualized chromosomes lying approximately parallel to one another across the nucleus. Labeling with probes to telomeres and centromeres confirmed a striking Rabl configuration in all cells, with a clear clustering of the centromeres, and cell files often maintained a common polarity through several division cycles. Transcription sites were detected by BrUTP incorporation in unfixed tissue sections and revealed a pattern of numerous foci uniformly distributed throughout the nucleoplasm, as well as more intensely labeled foci in the nucleoli. It has been suggested that the gene-rich regions in wheat chromosomes are clustered towards the telomeres. However, we found no indication of a difference in concentration of transcription sites between telomere and centromere poles of the nucleus. Neither could we detect any evidence that the transcription sites were preferentially localized with respect to the chromosome territorial boundaries."

"9352643","abstracttext","The genomic organisation of the Ty1-copia retrotransposons in rye (Secale cereale) has been studied. We have used the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify sequences from a conserved domain of the reverse transcriptase gene of the Ty1-copia retrotransposons in this species. Sequence analysis of 26 of these PCR products shows them to be a highly heterogeneous population, a feature that is common in plants. Slot blot analysis shows that there are about 100,000 individual Ty1-copia retrotransposons in rye. In situ hybridization of a heterogeneous probe, representing the whole population of rye Ty1-copia retrotransposon sequences, to chromosome spreads of triticale (xTriticosecale), a rye-wheat hybrid, shows that these sequences are present throughout all the rye chromosomes but absent from the centromeric regions and, in particular, from the terminal heterochromatin. Southern analysis of oat, barley, wheat, and rye, using as a probe R9, one of the rye sequences that is closely similar to the BARE-1 element of barley, shows that close relatives of this retrotransposon subgroup are present in all these species in high copy number. Northern analysis on RNAs from seedlings shows that the BARE-1 subgroup is transcribed in all these cereal plants but in variable amounts: high in barley, moderate in wheat and rye, and extremely low in oat."

"11444696","abstracttext","Regions of amino acid conservation in the NBS domain of NBS-LRR resistance proteins facilitated the PCR isolation of eight resistance gene analog (RGA) sequences from genomic DNA of rice, barley, and Aegilops tauschii. These clones and other RGAs previously isolated from maize, rice, and wheat were assigned to 13 classes by DNA-sequence comparison and by their patterns of hybridisation to restricted barley DNA. Using a doubled-haploid mapping population, probes from 12 RGA classes were used to map 17 loci in the barley genome. Many of these probes have been used for mapping in wheat, and the collective data indicate that the positions of orthologous RGAs are conserved between barley and wheat. RGA loci were identified in the vicinity of barley leaf rust resistance loci Rph4, Rph7, and Rph10. Recombinants were identified between RGA loci and Rph7 and Rph10, while a cluster of RGA sequences detected by probe 5.2 cosegregated with Rph4 in 55 F2 lines."
"10588759","articletitle","Herbicide sensitivity determinant of wheat plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase is located in a 400-amino acid fragment of the carboxyltransferase domain."
"10588759","abstracttext","A series of chimeral genes, consisting of the yeast GAL10 promoter, yeast ACC1 leader, wheat acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase; EC 6.4.1.2) cDNA, and yeast ACC1 3'-tail, was used to complement a yeast ACC1 mutation. These genes encode a full-length plastid enzyme, with and without the putative chloroplast transit peptide, as well as five chimeric cytosolic/plastid proteins. Four of the genes, all containing at least half of the wheat cytosolic ACCase coding region at the 5'-end, complement the yeast mutation. Aryloxyphenoxypropionate and cyclohexanedione herbicides, at concentrations below 10 microM, inhibit the growth of haploid yeast strains that express two of the chimeric ACCases. This inhibition resembles the inhibition of wheat plastid ACCase observed in vitro and in vivo. The differential response to herbicides localizes the sensitivity determinant to the third quarter of the multidomain plastid ACCase. Sequence comparisons of different multidomain and multisubunit ACCases suggest that this region includes part of the carboxyltransferase domain, and therefore that the carboxyltransferase activity of ACCase (second half-reaction) is the target of the inhibitors. The highly sensitive yeast gene-replacement strains described here provide a convenient system to study herbicide interaction with the enzyme and a powerful screening system for new inhibitors."
"10628998","articletitle","Cytologically integrated physical restriction fragment length polymorphism maps for the barley genome based on translocation breakpoints."
"10628998","abstracttext","We have developed a new technique for the physical mapping of barley chromosomes using microdissected translocation chromosomes for PCR with sequence-tagged site primers derived from >300 genetically mapped RFLP probes. The positions of 240 translocation breakpoints were integrated as physical landmarks into linkage maps of the seven barley chromosomes. This strategy proved to be highly efficient in relating physical to genetic distances. A very heterogeneous distribution of recombination rates was found along individual chromosomes. Recombination is mainly confined to a few relatively small areas spaced by large segments in which recombination is severely suppressed. The regions of highest recombination frequency (</=1 Mb/cM) correspond to only 4.9% of the total barley genome and harbor 47.3% of the 429 markers of the studied RFLP map. The results for barley correspond well with those obtained by deletion mapping in wheat. This indicates that chromosomal regions characterized by similar recombination frequencies and marker densities are highly conserved between the genomes of barley and wheat. The findings for barley support the conclusions drawn from deletion mapping in wheat that for all plant genomes, notwithstanding their size, the marker-rich regions are all of similar gene density and recombination activity and, therefore, should be equally accessible to map-based cloning."
"10603167","articletitle","Molecular characterization of a new furovirus mainly infecting rye."
"10603167","abstracttext","The complete or almost complete nucleotide sequences were determined for the two RNAs of three different sources of a new furovirus which mainly infects rye and for which the name Soil-borne rye mosaic furovirus (SBRMV) is proposed. The genome organization of this virus is virtually identical to that of Soil-borne wheat mosaic furovirus (SBWMV). However, SBRMV and SBWMV differ considerably in the nucleotide sequences of their genomes and in the derived amino acid sequences of their putative gene products. The sequences of the three sources of SBRMV (two from rye and one from wheat) differ between each other in various parts of their genomes by 1% to 10%. Larger differences were found in the readthrough part of the coat protein readthrough protein. There are no indications that the relationship of the C source from wheat to the other two sources from rye is more distant than the relationship between the two sources from rye. The 3'UTRs of both SBRMV RNAs are remarkable in having a predicted upstream pseudoknot domain (UPD) with seven pseudoknots. The same number was also predicted for the UPD of SBWMV RNA 1 whereas the much shorter UDP of SBWMV RNA 2 may form only four pseudoknots."
"10659706","articletitle","Fungal development and induction of defense response genes during early infection of wheat spikes by Fusarium graminearum."
"10659706","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat is a crippling disease that causes severe economic losses in many of the wheat-growing regions of the world. Temporal patterns of fungus development and transcript accumulation of defense response genes were studied in Fusarium graminearum-inoculated wheat spikes within the first 48 to 76 h after inoculation (hai). Microscopy of inoculated glumes revealed that the fungus appeared to penetrate through stomata, exhibited subcuticular growth along stomatal rows, colonized glume parenchyma cells, and sporulated within 48 to 76 hai. No major differences in the timing of these events were found between Sumai 3 (resistant) and Wheaton (susceptible) genotypes. In complementary experiments, RNA was extracted from spikes at several time intervals up to 48 hai and temporal expression patterns were determined for defense response genes encoding peroxidase, PR-1, PR-2 (beta-1,3-glucanase), PR-3 (chitinase), PR-4, and PR-5 (thaumatin-like protein). In both genotypes, transcripts for the six defense response genes accumulated as early as 6 to 12 hai during F. graminearum infection and peaked at 36 to 48 hai. Greater and earlier PR-4 and PR-5 transcript accumulation was observed in Sumai 3, compared with Wheaton. Our results show that the timing of defense response gene induction is correlated with F. graminearum infection."
"12974808","articletitle","Chromosomes form into seven groups in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat as a prelude to meiosis."
"12974808","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat possesses 42 chromosomes derived from its three ancestral genomes. The 21 pairs of chromosomes can be further divided into seven groups of six chromosomes (one chromosome pair being derived from each of the three ancestral genomes), based on the similarity of their gene order. Previous studies have revealed that, during anther development, the chromosomes associate in 21 pairs via their centromeres. The present study reveals that, as a prelude to meiosis, these 21 chromosome pairs in hexaploid (and tetraploid) wheat associate via the centromeres into seven groups as the telomeres begin to cluster. This results in the association of multiple chromosomes, which then need to be resolved as meiosis progresses. The formation of the seven chromosome clusters now explains the occasional occurrence of remnants of multiple associations, which have been reported at later stages of meiosis in hexaploid (and tetraploid) wheat. Importantly, the chromosomes have the opportunity to be resorted via these multiple interactions. As meiosis progresses, such interactions are resolved through the action of loci such as Ph1, leaving chromosomes as homologous pairs."

"11567588","abstracttext","The genotypic interaction between wheat resistance genes H3, H6, H7H8, H9 and virulence genes vH3, vH6, vH7vH8, vH9 of Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), was studied in a growth chamber. Results showed that plants homozygous and heterozygous for the H3 gene expressed a high level of resistance against homozygous avirulent and heterozygous larvae carrying the vH3 virulence allele. The H7H8 genes were highly effective in the homozygous condition, but displayed a reduced level of resistance in the heterozygous condition. The H6 and H9 genes showed different levels of resistance against the reciprocal heterozygous larvae (vH6(a)vH6(A) versus vH6(A)vH6(a) and vH9(a)vH9(A) versus vH9(A)vH9(a)). Adults reared from vH6(a)vH6(A) and vH9(a)vH9(A) larvae were all males, consistent with the vH6 and vH9 X-linkage. Plants homozygous for H3, H6, H7H8, and H9 allowed for greater larval survival of heterozygous larvae, which suggests that avirulence to these resistance genes is incompletely dominant. Greater survival of homozygous avirulent larvae on heterozygous plants (H3h3, H6h6, H7h7H8h8, H9h9) suggests incomplete dominance of these wheat genes. Survival of heterozygous along with homozygous virulent larvae would reduce selection pressure for virulence in Hessian fly populations infesting fields of resistant wheat cultivars. This would be expected to slow the increase in frequency of virulence alleles that often results from deployment of resistant cultivars."
"15620112","articletitle","Rapid changes of microsatellite flanking sequence in the allopolyploidization of new synthesized hexaploid wheat."
"15620112","abstracttext","It was suggested that the rapid changes of DNA sequence and gene expression occurred at the early stages of allopolyploid formation. In this study, we revealed the microsatellite (SSR) differences between newly formed allopolyploids and their donor parents by using 21 primer sets specific for D genome of wheat. It was indicated that rapid changes had occurred in the ""shock"" process of the allopolyploid formation between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii. The changes of SSR flanking sequence resulted in appearance of novel bands or disappearance of parental bands. The disappearance of the parental bands showed much higher frequencies in comparison with that of appearance of novel bands. Disappearance of the parental bands was not random. The frequency of disappearance in tetraploid wheat was much higher than in Ae. tauschii, i. e. the disappearance frequency in AABB genome was much higher than in D genome. Changes of SSR flanking sequence occurred at the early stage of F1 hybrid or just after chromosome doubling. From the above results, it can be inferred that SSR flanking sequence region was very active and was amenable to change in the process of polyploidization. This suggested that SSR flanking sequence probably had special biological function at the early stage of ployploidization. The rapid and directional changes at the early stage of polyploidization might contribute to the rapid evolution of the newly formed allopolyploid and allow the divergent genomes to act in harmony."

"15500466","abstracttext","We investigated the composition and the basis of genome expansion in the core Triticeae genome using Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of bread wheat. We sequenced an unfiltered genomic shotgun (trs) and a methylation-filtration (tmf) library of A. tauschii, and analyzed wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) to estimate the expression of genes and transposable elements (TEs). The sampled D-genome sequences consisted of 91.6% repetitive elements, 2.5% known genes, and 5.9% low-copy sequences of unknown function. TEs constituted 68.2% of the D-genome compared with 50% in maize and 14% in rice. The DNA transposons constituted 13% of the D-genome compared with 2% in maize. TEs were methylated unevenly within and among elements and families, and most were transcribed which contributed to genome expansion in the core Triticeae genome. The copy number of a majority of repeat families increased gradually following polyploidization. Certain TE families occupied discrete chromosome territories. Nested insertions and illegitimate recombination occurred extensively between the TE families, and a majority of the TEs contained internal deletions. The GC content varied significantly among the three sequence sets examined ranging from 42% in tmf to 46% in trs and 52% in the EST. Based on enrichment of genic sequences, methylation-filtration offers one option, although not as efficient as in maize, for isolating gene-rich regions from the large genome of wheat."

"12084480","abstracttext","To monitor the colonization of wheat roots by Azospirillum brasilense, we constructed several plasmids based on the pBBR1 replicon expressing the gfp and gusA genes constitutively. Both genes were placed under control of the gentamycin resistance gene promoter resulting in high levels of expression in Escherichia coli and A. brasilense. The constructed plasmids were stably maintained in A. brasilense strains even in the absence of selective pressure. The colonization of wheat plants grown under controlled conditions in sterilized vermiculite by A. brasilense strain FP2 (a Sp7-derivative) transconjugants containing these plasmids was monitored. Bacteria expressing GFP were easily observed in fresh plant material by fluorescence microscopy. Cell aggregates and single bacteria were visualized on the surfaces of young root zones, such as roots hairs and lateral roots. Large cellular clumps were observed at the points of lateral root emergence or at intercellular spaces of root epidermal cells 30 days after inoculation. Although we failed to detected bacteria in internal cortical and xylem tissues of wheat roots, the initial stage of endophytic colonization by A. brasilense may involve the sites detected in this work."

"12000132","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a major pathogen that causes fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and produces deoxynivalenol (DON) in infected grain. In previous studies, the trichodiene synthase gene (Tri5) in the fungal strain GZ3639 was disrupted to produce the DON-nonproducing strain GZT40. In this report, the virulence of strains GZ3639 and GZT40 was tested on wheat cultivars with various resistance levels by using methods of spray inoculation and injection inoculation with fungal conidia. Under field and greenhouse conditions, strain GZ3639 produced significantly more disease symptoms and reduced more yield than strain GZT40 in all wheat cultivars tested. Conidia of strain GZT40 germinated and infected inoculated spikelets, but disease symptoms were limited to inoculated spikelets without spread to uninoculated spikelets. When strain GZT40 was inoculated using the spray method, multiple initial infection sites in a spike resulted in higher levels of disease symptoms than in spikes inoculated by a single injection. Greenhouse tests confirmed that strain GZT40 did not produce DON in the infected kernels following either inoculation method. The results confirm that DON production plays a significant role in the spread of FHB within a spike, and are the first report that DON production is not necessary for initial infection by the fungus."

"12582490","abstracttext","Colinearity between wheat and rice genomes is quite well established at the chromosome level, but less is known at a finer level. We tried to specify these relationships for the wheat 5BS chromosome-arm distal region, where a major locus for crossability was located. By developing AFLP markers, we succeeded to locate this major QTL more precisely. One cloned AFLP fragment mapped to rice chromosome 11, which was in agreement with a rice chromosome-11 linkage block reported in this region. However a second marker, a RFLP probe, showed a break in synteny because it mapped to rice long-arm chromosomes 1 and 5, while screening a rice BAC library with the same probe identified rice chromosomes 5 and 6. Therefore, we concluded that the syntenic relationships were more complex at the fine level. The observed results might indicate the presence of a linkage block carrying a crossability gene on wheat groups 1, 5 and 7, and also on rice chromosomes 5 and 6."

Besides, STS markers for resistance genes Lr1, Lr9, Lr10, Lr24, Lr28, Lr37 were analysed in the studied cultivars and lines with Thatcher near-isogenic lines as positive controls.

Both primary and appressorial germ tubes were produced from individual Bgt conidia on the surface of the Arabidopsis leaves. Attempted infection occasionally resulted in successful penetration, which led to the development of an abnormal unilateral haustorium. Inoculation of a series of Arabidopsis defence-related mutants with Bgt resulted in the attenuation of reactive oxygen intermediate (ROI) production and salicylic acid (SA)-dependent defence gene expression in eds1, pad4 and nahG plants, which are known to be defective in some aspects of host resistance. Furthermore, Bgt often developed bilateral haustoria in the mutant Arabidopsis lines that closely resembled those formed in wheat. A similar decrease in NHR was observed following treatment of the wild-type Arabidopsis plants with cytochalasin E, an inhibitor of actin microfilament polymerisation. In eds1 mutants, inhibition of actin polymerisation severely compromised NHR in Arabidopsis against Bgt. This permitted completion of the Bgt infection cycle on these plants. Therefore, actin cytoskeletal function and EDS1 activity, in combination, are major contributors to NHR in Arabidopsis against wheat powdery mildew."

"15837429","abstracttext","Seventeen new genes encoding 24 kDa family dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors had been characterized from cultivated wheat and its diploid putative progenitors. And the different alpha-amylase inhibitors in this family, which were determined by coding regions single nucleotide polymorphisms (cSNPs) of their genes, were investigated. The amino acid sequences of 24 kDa alpha-amylase inhibitors shared very high coherence (91.2%). It indicated that the dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors in the 24 kDa family were derived from common ancestral genes by phylogenetic analysis. Eight alpha-amylase inhibitor genes were characterized from one hexaploid wheat variety, and clustered into four subgroups, indicating that the 24 kDa dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors in cultivated wheat were encoded by multi-gene. Forty-five cSNPs, including 35 transitions and 10 transversions, were found, and resulted in a total of ten amino acid changes. The cSNPs at the first site of a codon cause much more nonsynonymous (92.9%) than synonymous mutations, while nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations were almost equal when the cSNPs were at the third site. It was observed that there was Ile105 instead of Val105 at the active region Val104-Val105-Asp106-Ala107 of the alpha-amylase inhibitor by cSNPs in some inhibitors from Aegilops speltoides, diploid and hexaploid wheats."

"15996953","abstracttext","It has been postulated that osmotic effects on plant tissue are mediated by abscisic acid (ABA). Hybrid larch (Larix kaempferi (Lambert) Carr. x L. decidua Mill.) plantlets, transformed with the ABA-inducible wheat Em promoter associated with the Gus reporter gene, were axenically inoculated with two ectomycorrhizal fungi: Cenococcum geophilum Fr., considered tolerant to water stress, and Laccaria bicolor (Marie) Orton, considered less tolerant to drought. The mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal transgenic plantlets were subjected to osmotic stress by adding polyethylene glycol (PEG) to the culture medium. In the presence of PEG, L. bicolor and C. geophilum reduced shoot water potential and turgor potential, but increased host osmotic potential. Treatment of plantlets with PEG induced a significant increase in endogenous ABA concentrations. Laccaria bicolor and C. geophilum behaved similarly and significantly decreased the ABA response of plantlets to PEG treatment. Moreover, inoculation with either fungus regulated the ABA response of the plantlets even when the fungus was separated from the host by a cellophane sheet that prevented mycorrhiza formation. Although the wheat Em promoter was inducible in larch plantlets, it was not regulated by endogenous ABA. Induction of the wheat Em promoter in larch plantlets depended on organ type, with maximum induction in the root apex. Induction of the Em promoter was significantly decreased by mycorrhizal inoculation."

"16278510","abstracttext","Genetic relationships among 20 elite wheat genotypes were studied using microsatellite markers and pedigree analysis. A total of 93 polymorphic bands were obtained with 25 microsatellite primer pairs. Coefficient of parentage (COP) values were calculated using parentage information at the expansion level of 5. The pedigree-based similarity (mean 0.115, range 0.00-0.53) was lower than the similarity assessed using microsatellite markers (mean 0.70, range 0.47-0.91). Similarity estimates were used to construct dendrograms by using the unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA). Clustering of genotypes in respect of marker-based similarity revealed two groups. Genotype PBW442 diverged and appeared as distinct from all other genotypes in both marker-based and pedigree-based analysis. The correlation of COP values with genetic similarity values based on microsatellite markers is low (r = 0.285, p < 0.05). The results indicate a need to develop wheat varieties with a diverse genetic background and to incorporate new variability into the existing wheat gene pool."

"16053709","abstracttext","The differentially virulent race T1 of common bunt (Tilletia tritici) was used to inoculate the wheat lines Neepawa (compatible) and its sib BW553 (incompatible) that are nearly isogenic for the Bt-10 resistance gene. Inoculated crown tissues were used to construct a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library. Of the 1920 clones arrayed from the SSH cDNA library, approximately 10 % were differentially regulated. A total of 168 differentially up-regulated and 25 downregulated genes were identified and sequenced; 71 % sequences had significant homology to genes of known function, of which 59 % appeared to have roles in cellular metabolism and development, 24 % in abiotic/biotic stress responses, 3 % involved in transcription and signal transduction responses. Two putative resistance genes and a transcription factor were identified among the upregulated sequences. The expression of several candidate genes including a lipase, two non-specific lipid transfer proteins (ns-LTPs), and several wheat pathogenesis-related (PR)-proteins, was evaluated following 4 to 32 days postinoculation in compatible and incompatible interactions. Results confirmed the higher overall expression of these genes in resistant BW553 compared to susceptible Neepawa, and the differential up-regulation of wheat lipase, chitinase and PR-1 proteins in the expression of the incompatible interaction."

"16173460","abstracttext","The expression of foreign phytoalexins in a new host is thought to increase fungal resistance, since host-specific pathogens have not experienced selection for detoxifying or metabolising the novel antifungal compounds. Two resveratrol synthase genes vst1 and vst2 from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) and the pinosylvin synthase gene pss from pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) were stably transformed into bread wheat. The expression of the target genes is regulated by stress-inducible grapevine promoters. The vst1 and vst2 promoters were functional in wheat and retained their expression profiles described for grapevine. ALL vst and pss transgenic lines accumulated stilbene derivatives upon induction by UV light. The detected stilbenes showed a remarkable similarity to resveratrol and pinosylvin, however were found to be more hydrophilic than resveratrol and pinosylvin. Upon inoculation with the biotrophic pathogen Puccinia recondita f.sp. tritici several vst expressing wheat lines showed a significant reduction of disease symptoms (19 +/- 9% to 27 +/- 8%) compared to wild-type plants. The reduction of disease symptoms was even more obvious after inoculation with the facultative biotrophic pathogen Septoria nodorum Berk. and ranged from 42 +/- 13% to 71 +/- 4%. None of the four tested pss expressing lines showed a reduction in disease incidence."

"16184390","abstracttext","As a means to study the function of plasma membrane proteins during cold acclimation, we have isolated a cDNA clone for wpi6 which encodes a putative plasma membrane protein from cold-acclimated winter wheat. The wpi6 gene encodes a putative 5.9 kDa polypeptide with two predicted membrane-spanning domains, the sequence of which shows high sequence similarity with BLT101-family proteins from plants and yeast. Strong induction of wpi6 mRNA was observed during an early stage of cold acclimation in root and shoot tissues of both winter and spring wheat cultivars. In contrast to blt101 in barley, wpi6 mRNA was also induced by drought and salinity stresses, and exogenous application of ABA. Expression of wpi6 in a Deltapmp3 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is disturbed in plasma membrane potential due to the lack of a BLT101-family protein, partially complemented NaCl sensitivity of the mutant. Transient expression analysis of a WPI6::GFP fusion protein in onion epidermal cells revealed that WPI6 is localized in the plasma membrane. Taken together, these data suggested that WPI6 may have a protective role in maintaining plasma membrane function during cold acclimation in wheat."

"16755132","abstracttext","A number of cold responsive (Cor)/late embryogenesis abundant (Lea) genes are induced by both low temperature (LT) and dehydration. To understand the molecular basis of cold acclimation and its relationship with drought stress response in wheat seedlings, we isolated a DREB2 homolog Wdreb2, which is the candidate gene for a transcription factor of the Cor/Lea genes. The Wdreb2 expression was activated by cold, drought, salt and exogenous ABA treatment. Detailed expression studies of Wdreb2 indicated the involvement of two distinct pathways of its activation, a drought and salt stress-responsive pathway and a cold-responsive pathway. The transient expression analysis showed that the Wrab19 expression was directly activated by the WDREB2 transcription factor in wheat cells. Three transcript forms of Wdreb2 (Wdreb2alpha, Wdreb2beta and Wdreb2gamma) were produced through alternative splicing. Under drought and salt stress conditions, the amount of the Wdreb2beta form remained fairly constant during 24-hour treatment, while those of the Wdreb2alpha and Wdreb2gamma forms showed transient increases. On the other hand, the LT treatment resulted in increased transcript levels of all three forms of Wdreb2. Thus, under the LT and drought/salt stress conditions the amount of the WDREB2 transcription factors in wheat is differentially controlled by the level of transcription and alternative splicing."

"19249362","abstracttext","The effect of ferulic acid, the most abundant phenolic acid in wheat bran, was studied in vitro on type B trichothecene biosynthesis by Fusarium. It was demonstrated that ferulic acid is an efficient inhibitor of mycotoxin production by all strains of Fusarium tested, including different chemotypes and species. To analyse the mechanism of toxin biosynthesis inhibition by ferulic acid, expression of representative Tri genes, involved in the trichothecene biosynthesis pathway, was monitored by real-time RT-PCR. A decrease in the level of Tri gene expression was measured, suggesting that inhibition of toxin synthesis by ferulic acid could be regulated at the transcriptional level. Moreover, toxin production was shown to be reduced proportionally to the initial amount of ferulic acid added in the culture medium. Addition of ferulic acid either at the spore germination step or to a mycelial culture resulted in the same final inhibitory effect on mycotoxin accumulation. A cumulative inhibitory effect on trichothecene biosynthesis was even observed with successive supplementation of ferulic acid. Ferulic acid, which content varies among wheat varieties, could then play an important role in modulating trichothecene biosynthesis by Fusarium in some wheat varieties."

The complete coding regions of four Glu-B3 genes with complete coding sequence were obtained and designated as GluB3-1, GluB3-2, GluB3-3 and GluB3-4. Ten allele-specific PCR markers designed from the SNPs present in the sequenced variants discriminated the Glu-B3 proteins of electrophoretic mobility alleles a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h and i. These markers were validated on 161 wheat varieties and advanced lines with different Glu-B3 alleles, thus confirming that the markers can be used in marker-assisted breeding for wheat grain processing quality."

"19383094","abstracttext","Ethylene signalling affects the resistance of dicotyledonous plant species to diverse pathogens but almost nothing is known about the role of this pathway in monocotyledonous crop species. Fusarium graminearum causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) of cereals, contaminating grain with mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON). Very little is known about the mechanisms of resistance/susceptibility to this disease. Genetic and chemical genetic studies were used to examine the influence of ethylene (ET) signalling and perception on infection of dicotyledonous (Arabidopsis) and monocotyledonous (wheat and barley) species by F. graminearum. Arabidopsis mutants with reduced ET signalling or perception were more resistant to F. graminearum than wild-type, while mutants with enhanced ET production were more susceptible. These findings were confirmed by chemical genetic studies of Arabidopsis, wheat and barley. Attenuation of expression of EIN2 in wheat, a gene encoding a core component of ethylene signalling, reduced both disease symptoms and DON contamination of grain. Fusarium graminearum appears to exploit ethylene signalling in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous species. This demonstration of translation from model to crop species provides a foundation for improving resistance of cereal crops to FHB through identification of allelic variation for components of the ethylene-signalling pathway."

"19386040","abstracttext","Over 3.5 million expressed sequence tags from the major cereal taxa were used to electronically mine over 176,000 putative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The density, distribution and degree of linkage between these SNPs were compared among the different taxa. The frequency of sequence polymorphism was lowest in diploid taxa (rice, barley and sorghum), intermediate in tetraploid maize and highest in allohexaploid wheat and octoploid sugarcane. SNPs were further categorized as either intravarietal (differences between gene family members and homoeologues) or varietal (differences between two varieties), and as either co-segregating or non-co-segregating with neighbouring polymorphisms. Varietal co-segregating SNPs represent the best candidates for molecular markers as they show variation between varieties and have a high probability of being validated, as sequencing errors are unlikely to co-segregate with one another. This elite class of SNPs was most abundant in barley and least abundant in wheat and rice. Despite the large number of observed sequence polymorphisms in allohexaploid wheat, only a fraction of those available are likely to make good molecular markers. In addition, we found that rice SNPs up to 10 kb apart were in linkage disequilibrium (LD), but that high levels of LD attributable to population structure confounded the tracking of LD over greater distances."

Only one HMW prolamine subunit with the similar electrophoresis mobility to the y-type HMW glutenin subunit of hexaploid wheat was observed in two accessions of C. delileana by SDS-PAGE analyses of the total storage protein fractions. It was confirmed by sequencing and expression analysis that this prolamine subunit was an x-type subunit. The amino acid sequence of this subunit had the similar typical structure to those of x-type HMW glutenin genes previously described in wheat. An in-frame stop codon was found in the coding sequences of y-type prolamine subunits. It was found by specifically extraction of HMW prolamines and sequence analysis that the coding regions of Ky prolamine subunit gene is very likely to be not expressed as a full-length protein. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Kx subunit could be clustered together with 1Ax1 subunit by an interior paralleled branch, and Ky subunit (inactive) was most closely related to the 1Ay subunit. The coding sequences of Kx subunit could successfully be expressed in bacterial expression system, and the expressed protein had the same electrophoresis mobility as the Kx subunit from the seed of C. delileana. It was the first time that the HMW prolamines subunits encoded by K genome of C. delileana were characterized."

Supplementation of the wheat-based diet with transformed L. reuteri Pg4 decreased intestinal viscosity, caecal coliform population, and increased body weight gain and ileal villus height and crypt depth from 0 to 21 d of age. It also decreased excreta ammonia concentrations, and increased the caecal total volatile fatty acid (VFA) and lactic acid concentrations from 0 to 21 d and 22 to 37 d of age. 4. Further, it was demonstrated that 40% of the Lactobacillus cells randomly isolated from the digesta of the ileum and caecum of the supplemented group possessed xylanase secretion capability. 5. It appears reasonable to assume, therefore, that the derived benefit is a result of the organism surviving, and the associated performance of some function in the intestinal tract which benefits gut health."

"17924091","abstracttext","Septoria tritici blotch, caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici), is one of the most important foliar diseases of wheat in much of the world. Susceptibility of host plants to septoria was investigated by cytogenetic analysis. A line of Hobbit sib (Dwarf A) in which translocated chromosome 5BS-7BS was nominally substituted by chromosome arms 5BS and 7BS from Bezostaya 1 had a much lower mean level of septoria than Hobbit sib itself. By the use of microsatellite markers, it was shown that the 5BS arm of this line had in fact been substituted by the homologous arm of Chinese Spring. Further investigation of substitution and nullitetrasomic lines demonstrated that chromosome arm 5BS of Hobbit sib possesses genes, which either promote susceptibility to septoria or suppress resistance. This chromosome arm has previously been shown to carry genes for resistance to yellow (stripe) rust and powdery mildew, implying a trade-off between resistances to these two diseases and to septoria in wheat breeding. Bezostaya 1 was found to have specific resistance to M. graminicola isolate IPO323, probably controlled by the gene Stb6 on chromosome arm 3AS, present in numerous wheat cultivars. It also had partial resistance to septoria distributed over several chromosomes, which may explain the value of this cultivar as a source of septoria resistance."

The authors used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) to characterize the genetic structure of two G. zeae populations from commercial wheat fields. The working hypothesis was that sufficient genetic exchange occurs between local populations to prevent significant partitioning of allelic variation. We analysed 216 AFLP loci for 113 isolates collected during the 2002 harvest season. All strains had AFLP profiles typical of G. zeae lineage 7. Both populations were genotypically diverse but genetically similar and potentially part of a larger, randomly mating population, with significant genetic exchange probably occurring between the two subpopulations. Linkage disequilibrium was low, but higher than reported for many other populations of G. zeae, and about 20% of the alleles detected were specific to one of the two subpopulations - results consistent with limited gene exchange between the two subpopulations. This study extends previous work with populations of G. zeae to include those found in Argentina, one of the world's largest wheat growing countries."

"17980516","abstracttext","The hypersensitive response (HR) is one of the most efficient forms of plant defense against biotrophic pathogens and results in localized cell death and the formation of necrotic lesions. In this study, a novel putative hypersensitive induced reaction (HIR) gene from wheat leaves infected by incompatible stripe rust pathogen CY23, designated as Ta-hir1, was identified by using rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Ta-hir1 encodes 284 amino acids, with a predicted molecular mass of 31.31 KDa. A phylogenetic analysis showed that Ta-hir1 was highly homologous to Hv-hir1 from barley at both cDNA and deduced amino-acid levels. Amino-acid sequence analysis of the wheat HIR protein indicated the presence of the SPFH (Stomatins, Prohibitins, Flotillins and HflK/C) protein domain typical for stomatins which served as a negative regulator of univalent cation permeability, especially for potassium. The expression profile of the Ta-hir1 transcript detected by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time polymerase chain reaction (real time-PCR), respectively, showed that the highest expression occurred 48 h post inoculation (hpi), which is consistent with our previous histopathology observations during the stripe rust fungus-wheat incompatible reaction."

"20204912","abstracttext","The importance and widespread incidence of Fusarium poae as a natural contaminant of wheat in different climatic areas warrants investigation into the genetic diversity and toxin profile of a northern Italy population. Eighty-one strains of F. poae isolated from durum wheat kernels, identified by species-specific polymerase chain reaction and translation elongation factor-1alpha gene sequence analysis, were genetically characterized by the amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique and analysed by high-pressure liquid chromatography for their ability to produce the beauvericin (BEA) and trichothecene mycotoxins. A high level of variability was observed by using AFLP analyses, with the lowest level of genetic similarity among the strains being approximately 61%. Most of the strains, 95%, produced BEA at <2655 microg g(-1); 88% produced the trichothecene nivalenol at <865 microg g(-1) and 76% produced the trichothecene fusarenon-X at <167 microg g(-1). These data show that F. poae can produce high amounts of BEA together with trichothecenes, and can represent a high potential mycotoxin risk in Italy for wheat colonized by this species."

A random plasmid insertion mutagenesis approach was used to analyze the pathogenicity of the PH-1 strain, for which full genomic information is available. Fungal transformants were initially screened for their ability to infect wheat ears. From a total of 1,170 transformants screened, eight were confirmed to be highly reduced in pathogenicity toward wheat ears and roots. These were designated disease-attenuated F. graminearum (daf) mutants. The in vitro growth rate and appearance of each daf mutant was equivalent to the parental strain. Deoxynivalenol (DON) was not detected in threshed grain recovered from ears inoculated with the daf10 mutant. Plasmid rescue and sequencing of the mutant daf10 revealed a deletion of approximately 350 kb from one end of chromosome 1. This chromosome segment is predicted to contain 146 genes. Microarray analysis of daf10 gene expression during growth in DON-inducing conditions confirmed the large deletion. The identities of the genes deleted and their potential role in DON production, pathogenesis, and other life processes are discussed."

"20381366","abstracttext","The methionine salvage pathway is conserved from prokaryotes to high eukaryotes. The reaction catalyzed by aci-reductone-dioxygenase (ARD) represents a branch point in the methionine salvage pathway. A novel aci-reductone-dioxygenase gene, designed as TaARD, was identified in a subtraction library constructed with RNA isolated from wheat leaves infected with the stripe rust pathogen. TaARD was predicted to encode a 197 amino acid protein that belongs to the cupin superfamily. In transient expression assays with onion epidermal cells, the TaARD-GFP fusion protein localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm. Southern blot analysis showed that the wheat genome had multiple copies of TaARD. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that the TaARD transcript was induced in wheat leaves infected with a compatible stripe rust strain. However, its expression was reduced or suppressed in incompatible interactions and by ABA, ethephon (ET), or salicylic acid (SA) treatments. With methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, TaARD transcript level was suppressed in the first 6h but increased afterwards. The expression of TaARD also was inhibited by wounding and environmental stimuli, including high salinity and low temperature. Because of the role of ARD in the methionine salvage pathway, these results suggest that TaARD may be involved in ethylene synthesis and ethylene signaling in response to biotic and abiotic stresses."

A compatible Tsn1-ToxA interaction is known to play a major role in conferring susceptibility of hexaploid (common) wheat to SNB. However, a recent study by another group suggested that the Tsn1-ToxA interaction was not relevant in conferring susceptibility of the tetraploid (durum) wheat cv. Langdon (LDN). Here, we reevaluated the role of the Tsn1-ToxA interaction in governing SNB susceptibility using the same mapping population and Stagonospora nodorum isolate (Sn2000) as were used in the previous study. Results of our quantitative trait locus analysis showed that the Tsn1 locus accounted for 95% of the variation in SNB. In addition, inoculation of the mapping population with two ToxA-knockout strains of Sn2000 revealed that the entire population was resistant. Furthermore, several LDN Tsn1-disrupted mutants were evaluated and found to be resistant to SNB. Together, these results prove unequivocally that Tsn1 is the only factor present along chromosome 5B that governs response to SNB in this population and that a compatible Tsn1-ToxA interaction is necessary for the manifestation of disease. Therefore, the results from the previous study are refuted."
"19649200","articletitle","Role of lignification in plant defense."
"19649200","abstracttext","For a long time it has been believed that lignification has an important role in host defense against pathogen invasion. Recently, by using an RNAi gene-silencing assay we showed that monolignol biosynthesis plays a critical role in cell wall apposition (CWA)-mediated defense against powdery mildew fungus penetration into diploid wheat. Silencing monolignol genes led to super-susceptibility of wheat leaf tissues to an appropriate pathogen, Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), and compromised penetration resistance to a non-appropriate pathogen, B. graminis f. sp. hordei. Autofluorescence of CWA regions was reduced significantly at the fungal penetration sites in silenced cells. Our work indicates an important role for monolignol biosynthetic genes in effective CWA formation against pathogen penetration. In this addendum, we show that silencing of monolignol genes also compromised penetration resistant to Bgt in a resistant wheat line. In addition, we discuss possible insights into how lignin biosynthesis contributes to host defense."

The fibrin zymography analysis reveals the presence of at least three fibrinolytic enzymes. The crude enzyme exhibited maximal activity at 60 degrees C and pH 8.0. Medium composition and culture conditions for the enzyme production by B. subtilis A26 were optimized using two statistical methods. The Plackett-Burman statistical design was applied to find the key ingredients and conditions for the best yield of enzyme production. Five significant variables (hulled grain of wheat, casein peptone, NaCl, CaCl2, and initial pH) were selected for the optimization studies. The response surface methodological approach was used to determine the optimal concentrations and conditions. The optimized medium contained 40.0 g.L-1 hulled grain of wheat, 3.53 g.L-1 casein peptone, 4.0 g.L-1 CaCl2, 3.99 g.L-1 NaCl, 0.01 g.L-1 MgSO4, and 0.01 g.L-1 KH2PO4, pH 7.78. The medium optimization resulted in a 4.2-fold increased level of fibrinolytic production (269.36 U.mL-1) compared with that obtained with the initial medium (63.45 U.mL-1). A successful and significant improvement in the production of protease by the A26 strain was accomplished using inexpensive carbon substrate (hulled grain of wheat), allowing a significant reduction in the cost of medium constituents."

"19377037","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum is an important disease of wheat and barley. In a previous study, we identified several mutants with reduced virulence by insertional mutagenesis. A transducin beta-like gene named FTL1 was disrupted in one of these nonpathogenic mutants. FTL1 is homologous to Saccharomyces cerevisiae SIF2, which is a component of the Set3 complex involved in late stages of ascospore formation. The Delta ftl1 mutant was significantly reduced in conidiation and failed to cause typical disease symptoms. It failed to colonize the vascular tissues of rachis or cause necrosis on the rachis of inoculated wheat heads. The Delta ftl1 mutant also was defective in spreading from infected anthers to ovaries and more sensitive than the wild type to plant defensins MsDef1 and osmotin. However, the activation of two mitogen-activated protein kinases, Mgv1 and Gpmk1, production of deoxynivalenol, and expression of genes known to be important for plant infection in F. graminearum were not affected, indicating that the defect of the Delta ftl1 mutant in plant infection is unrelated to known virulence factors in this pathogen and may involve novel mechanisms. The Delta ftl1 deletion mutant was significantly reduced in histone deacetylation, and many members of the yeast Set3 complex are conserved in F. graminearum. FTL1 appears to be a component of this well-conserved protein complex that plays a critical role in the penetration and colonization of wheat tissues."

"21952112","abstracttext","In this study, we explore the diversity and its distribution along the wheat leaf rust resistance protein LR10 three-dimensional structure. Lr10 is a leaf rust resistance gene encoding a coiled coil-nucleotide-binding site-leucine-rich repeat (CC-NBS-LRR) class of protein. Lr10 was cloned and sequenced from 58 accessions representing diverse habitats of wild emmer wheat in Israel. Nucleotide diversity was very high relative to other wild emmer wheat genes (π= 0.029). The CC domain was found to be the most diverse domain and subject to positive selection. Superimposition of the diversity on the CC three-dimensional structure showed that some of the variable and positively selected residues were solvent exposed and may interact with other proteins. The LRR domain was relatively conserved, but showed a hotspot of amino acid variation between two haplotypes in the ninth repeat. This repeat was longer than the other LRRs, and three-dimensional modelling suggested that an extensive α helix structure was formed in this region. The two haplotypes also differed in splicing regulation motifs. In genotypes with one haplotype, an intron was alternatively spliced in this region, whereas, in genotypes with the other haplotype, this intron did not splice at all. The two haplotypes are proposed to be ancient and maintained by balancing selection."

"22594629","abstracttext","We present the first results from a novel multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population derived from four elite wheat cultivars. The large size of this MAGIC population (1579 progeny), its diverse genetic composition and high levels of recombination all contribute to its value as a genetic resource. Applications of this resource include interrogation of the wheat genome and the analysis of gene-trait association in agronomically important wheat phenotypes. Here, we report the utilization of a MAGIC population for the first time for linkage map construction. We have constructed a linkage map with 1162 DArT, single nucleotide polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers distributed across all 21 chromosomes. We benchmark this map against a high-density DArT consensus map created by integrating more than 100 biparental populations. The linkage map forms the basis for further exploration of the genetic architecture within the population, including characterization of linkage disequilibrium, founder contribution and inclusion of an alien introgression into the genetic map. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the resource for quantitative trait loci mapping using the complex traits plant height and hectolitre weight as a proof of principle."

"22835271","abstracttext","The gene Tri12 encodes a predicted major facilitator superfamily protein suggested to play a role in export of trichothecene mycotoxins produced by Fusarium spp. It is unclear, however, how the Tri12 protein (Tri12p) may influence trichothecene sensitivity and virulence of the wheat pathogen Fusarium graminearum. In this study, we establish a role for Tri12 in toxin accumulation and sensitivity as well as in pathogenicity toward wheat. Tri12 deletion mutants (tri12) are reduced in virulence and result in decreased trichothecene accumulation when inoculated on wheat compared with the wild-type strain or an ectopic mutant. Reduced radial growth of tri12 mutants on trichothecene biosynthesis induction medium was observed relative to the wild type and the ectopic strains. Diminished trichothecene accumulation was observed in liquid medium cultures inoculated with tri12 mutants. Wild-type fungal cells grown under conditions that induce trichothecene biosynthesis develop distinct subapical swelling and form large vacuoles. A strain expressing Tri12p linked to green fluorescent protein shows localization of the protein consistent with the plasma membrane. Our results indicate Tri12 plays a role in self-protection and influences toxin production and virulence of the fungus in planta."

"21062315","abstracttext","The male sterility of a wheat thermosensitive genic male sterile (TGMS) line is strictly controlled by temperature. When the TGMS line BS366 was exposed to 10 °C from the pollen mother cell stage to the meiosis stage, a few pollen grains were formed and devoid of starch. We report here a large-scale transcriptomic study using the Affymetrix wheat GeneChip to follow gene expression in BS366 line anthers in response to cold stress. Notably, many cytoskeletal signaling components were gradually induced in response to cold stress in BS366 line anthers. However, the cytoskeleton-associated genes that play key roles in the dynamic organization of the cytoskeleton were dramatically repressed. Histological studies revealed that the separation of dyads occurred abnormally during male meiosis I, indicating defective male meiotic cytokinesis. Fluorescence labelling and subcellular histological observations revealed that the phragmoplast was defectively formed and the cell plate was abnormally assembled during meiosis I under cold stress. Based on the transcriptomic analysis and observations of characterized histological changes, our results suggest that cold stress repressed transcription of cytoskeleton dynamic factors and subsequently caused the defective cytokinesis during meiosis I. The results may explain the male sterility caused by low temperature in wheat TGMS lines."

"22180070","abstracttext","Analysis of DNA sequence variation among genotypes is useful for differentiation of wheat accessions, selection strategies and genetic development of crop plants. We screened molecular markers for yellow rust resistance genes (Yr7, Yr9, Yr15, Yr18, Yr26, and YrH52), which are in the gene-rich regions of wheat chromosomes 1B, 2B, and 7D, to investigate DNA sequence differences and repeat motifs and numbers between wheat cultivars resistant (Izgi2001, Sonmez2001, PI178383) and susceptible (Aytin98, ES14, Harmankaya99) to yellow rust. The F(2) individuals derived from the crosses were evaluated for yellow rust resistance at both the seedling and adult stages to identify DNA markers genetically linked to yellow rust resistance. The most repeated motif was found to be GA and the least repeated motif TAGA among the cultivars. When we examined DNA sequence differences (insertion, deletion and single nucleotide changes), the molecular markers Xgwm526 (Yr7) and Xgwm273 (YrH52) were found to have the most conserved regions and Yr15 (Xgwm413) the least conserved regions among the cultivars. This DNA sequence information can be used for selection of suitable parents, creating mapping populations and developing molecular markers associated with yellow rust resistance in plant breeding programs."

"22253984","abstracttext","The immunogenic potential of α-gliadin protein from two ancient wheats was studied with reference to coeliac disease. To this aim we investigated Graziella Ra® and Kamut® (the latter is considered an ancient relative of modern durum wheat) in comparison to four durum wheat accessions (Senatore Cappelli, Flaminio, Grazia and Svevo). ELISA and Western Blot analyses - carried out by two monoclonal antibodies raised against the α-gliadin peptides p31-49 (LGQQQPFPQQPYPQPQPF) and p56-75 (LQLQPFPQPQLPYPQPQLPY) containing a core region (underlined) reported to be toxic for coeliac patients - always showed an antibody-antigen positive reaction. For all accessions, an α-gliadin gene has also been cloned and sequenced. Deduced amino acid sequences constantly showed the toxic motifs. In conclusion, we strongly recommend that coeliac patients should avoid consuming Graziella Ra® or Kamut®. In fact their α-gliadin not only is as toxic as one of the other wheat accessions, but also occurs in greater amount, which is in line with the higher level of proteins in ancient wheats when compared to modern varieties."

"22330896","abstracttext","Environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, and cold are major factors that significantly limit agricultural productivity. NAC transcription factors play essential roles in response to various abiotic stresses. However, the paucity of wheat NAC members functionally characterized to date does not match the importance of this plant as a world staple crop. Here, the function of TaNAC2 was characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. A fragment of TaNAC2 was obtained from suppression subtractive cDNA libraries of wheat treated with polyethylene glycol, and its full-length cDNA was obtained by searching a full-length wheat cDNA library. Gene expression profiles indicated that TaNAC2 was involved in response to drought, salt, cold, and abscisic acid treatment. To test its function, transgenic Arabidopsis lines overexpressing TaNAC2-GFP controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were generated. Overexpression of TaNAC2 resulted in enhanced tolerances to drought, salt, and freezing stresses in Arabidopsis, which were simultaneously demonstrated by enhanced expression of abiotic stress-response genes and several physiological indices. Therefore, TaNAC2 has potential for utilization in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stress tolerances in crops."

Haynaldia villosa) is an annual wild diploid grass species (2n = 2x = 14; genome VV) belonging to the Poaceae family, which is considered to be an important source of biotic and abiotic stress resistance genes for wheat breeding. Enhanced characterization of D. villosum chromosomes can facilitate exploitation of its gene pool and its use in wheat breeding programs. Here we present the cytogenetic identification of D. villosum chromosomes on slide by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), with the GAA simple sequence repeat (SSR) as a probe. We also describe the isolation and the flow cytometric analysis of D. villosum chromosomes in suspension, resulting in a distinguished flow karyotype. Chromosomes were flow sorted into three fractions, according their DNA content, one of which was composed of a single type of chromosome, namely 6 V, sorted with over 85% purity. Chromosome 6 V is known to carry genes to code for important resistance and seed storage characteristics, and its isolation represents a new source of genetic traits and specific markers useful for wheat improvement."
"23231605","articletitle","Wheat CBF gene family: identification of polymorphisms in the CBF coding sequence."
"23231605","abstracttext","Expression of cold-regulated genes needed for protection against freezing stress is mediated, in part, by the CBF transcription factor family. Previous studies with temperate cereals suggested that the CBF gene family in wheat was large, and that CBF genes were at the base of an important low temperature tolerance trait. Therefore, the goal of our study was to identify the CBF repertoire in the freezing-tolerant hexaploid wheat cultivar Norstar, and then to examine if the coding region of CBF genes in two spring cultivars contain polymorphisms that could affect the protein sequence and structure. Our analyses reveal that hexaploid wheat contains a complex CBF family consisting of at least 65 CBF genes of which 60 are known to be expressed in the cultivar Norstar. They represent 27 paralogous genes with 1-3 homeologous copies for the A, B, and D genomes. The cultivar Norstar contains two pseudogenes and at least 24 additional proteins having sequences and (or) structures that deviate from the consensus in the conserved AP2 DNA-binding and (or) C-terminal activation-domains. This suggests that in cultivars such as Norstar, low temperature tolerance may be increased through breeding of additional optimal alleles. The examination of the CBF repertoire present in the two spring cultivars, Chinese Spring and Manitou, reveals that they have additional polymorphisms affecting conserved positions in these domains. Understanding the effects of these polymorphisms will provide additional information for the selection of optimum CBF alleles in Triticeae breeding programs."

"23551421","abstracttext","Glaucousness is described as the scattering effect of visible light from wax deposited on the cuticle of plant aerial organs. In wheat, two dominant genes lead to non-glaucous phenotypes: Inhibitor of wax 1 (Iw1) and Iw2. The molecular mechanisms and the exact extent (beyond visual assessment) by which these genes affect the composition and quantity of cuticular wax is unclear. To describe the Iw1 locus we used a genetic approach with detailed biochemical characterization of wax compounds. Using synteny and a large number of F2 gametes, Iw1 was fine-mapped to a sub-cM genetic interval on wheat chromosome arm 2BS, which includes a single collinear gene from the corresponding Brachypodium and rice physical maps. The major components of flag leaf and peduncle cuticular waxes included primary alcohols, β-diketones and n-alkanes. Small amounts of C19-C27 alkyl and methylalkylresorcinols that have not previously been described in wheat waxes were identified. Using six pairs of BC2 F3 near-isogenic lines, we show that Iw1 inhibits the formation of β- and hydroxy-β-diketones in the peduncle and flag leaf blade cuticles. This inhibitory effect is independent of genetic background or tissue, and is accompanied by minor but consistent increases in n-alkanes and C24 primary alcohols. No differences were found in cuticle thickness and carbon isotope discrimination in near-isogenic lines differing at Iw1."

"23814436","abstracttext","To explore the adaptability of bread wheat to dehydration stress, we screened 28 cultivars collected from different agroclimatic zones, on the basis of malonaldehyde content as biochemical marker in roots of wheat seedlings during germination and classified them as highly tolerant, tolerant, sensitive and highly sensitive. From this primary screening, ten cultivars that showed differential responses to dehydration stress were selected to understand the biochemical and physiological basis of stress tolerance mechanisms. The highly tolerant cultivars showed lower levels of lipid peroxidation, less membrane damage, increased levels of antioxidants, enzymes like catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione reductase activities, and maintained higher relative water content in comparison to sensitive cultivars, indicating better protection mechanism operating in tolerant cultivars. Correspondingly, highly tolerant cultivars exhibited more accumulation of proline and less H2O2 content across different time points of polyethylene glycol treatments in comparison to sensitive ones. The above biochemical and physiological parameters were further validated through northern analysis of catalase (CAT1) gene, that showed differential expression patterns in tolerant and sensitive cultivars largely in confirmation with the biochemical and physiological analyses. Our study positively correlates the differences in the redox status and antioxidant defense system between tolerant and sensitive cultivars for the establishment of wheat seedlings in typical dehydration conditions."
"23111787","articletitle","Wheat hypersensitive-induced reaction genes TaHIR1 and TaHIR3 are involved in response to stripe rust fungus infection and abiotic stresses."
"23111787","abstracttext","KEY MESSAGE : TaHIR1 and TaHIR3 play positive roles in resistance to the stripe rust fungus via inducing HR and regulating defense-related genes, but are negatively regulated by various abiotic stimuli. Plant hypersensitive-induced reaction (HIR) genes are known to be associated with the hypersensitive response and disease defense. In wheat, two HIR genes, TaHIR1 and TaHIR3, have been identified and found to be up-regulated after infection with the stripe rust fungus. Here, we further determined their roles in defense against abiotic stresses and the stripe rust pathogen, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. TaHIR1 and TaHIR3 proteins were localized in the plasma membrane of tobacco cells. The expression of TaHIR1 and TaHIR3 was reduced by the environmental stimuli, including low temperature, drought, and high salinity stresses. In addition, the expression of TaHIR1 and TaHIR3 was down-regulated by exogenously applied ethrel and abscisic acid, whereas expression was not affected by treatments with salicylic acid and methyl jasmonate. Furthermore, barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing of TaHIR1 and TaHIR3 reduced resistance in wheat cultivar Suwon11 against an avirulent stripe rust pathotype CYR23 and area of necrotic cells neighboring the infection sites, and altered the expression levels of defense-related genes. These results suggest that TaHIR1 and TaHIR3 function positively in the incompatible interaction of wheat-stripe rust fungus, but exhibit negative transcriptional response to abiotic stresses."

"24665724","abstracttext","Heat stress exerts a profound impact on the resistance of plants to parasites. In this research, we investigated the impact of an acute transient heat stress on the resistance of the wheat line 'Molly,' which contains the R gene H13, to an avirulent Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor (Say)) population. We found that a significant portion of Molly seedlings stressed at 40 degrees C for 6 h during or after the initial Hessian fly larval attack became susceptible to otherwise avirulent insects, whereas unstressed control plants remained 100% resistant. Specifically, 77.8, 73.3, 83.3, and 46.7% of plants heat stressed at 0, 6,12, and 24 h, respectively, after the initial larval attack became susceptible. Biochemical analysis revealed that heat stress caused a transient decrease in 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, but an increase in salicylic acid accumulation in Molly plants. The change in phytohormones after heat stress and Hessian fly infestation was not observed in 'Newton,' a near-isogenic but Hessian fly susceptible wheat line. Instead, heat stress caused a relatively prolonged reduction in palmitoleic acid. The role of phytohormones in heat-induced loss of wheat resistance was discussed."

"24752830","abstracttext","Seed dormancy is an important agronomic trait: low levels can cause premature germination, while too much can inhibit uniform germination. As an approach to controlling the seed dormancy level in crops, we used Triticeae DOG1-like genes as transgenes. DOG1 is an Arabidopsis gene that underlies natural variation in seed dormancy. We previously showed that although their sequence similarities to DOG1 were low, some cereal DOG1-like genes enhanced seed dormancy in Arabidopsis. Here, we introduced two DOG1-like genes, TaDOG1L4 from wheat and HvDOG1L1 from barley, individually into the wheat cultivar Fielder. Their overexpression under the control of a maize ubiquitin promoter enhanced the seed dormancy level while leaving other traits unchanged. TaDOG1L4 was more effective than HvDOG1L1, which accords with the previously revealed difference in the effectiveness of these two genes in Arabidopsis seed dormancy. Knockdown of endogenous TaDOG1L4 in Fielder using double-strand RNA interference decreased the seed dormancy level by several tens of percent. This result indicates that some degree of seed dormancy inherent in wheat is imparted by DOG1-like genes."

"24074260","abstracttext","Proteomic studies were performed to identify the protein species involved in copper (Cu) stress responses in common wheat. Two-week-old wheat seedlings were exposed to 100 μM CuSO4 treatment for 3 days. Growth of shoots and roots was markedly inhibited and lipid peroxidation was greatly increased. Cu was readily absorbed by wheat seedlings, with greater Cu contents in roots than in leaves. Using 2-DE method, 98 protein spots showed significantly enhanced or reduced abundance, of which 93 were successfully identified. Of these identified protein species, 49 and 44 were found in roots and leaves, respectively. Abundance of most of identified protein species, which function in signal transduction, stress defense, and energy production, was significantly enhanced, while that of many protein species involved in carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, and photosynthesis was severely reduced. The Cu-responsive protein interaction network revealed 36 key proteins, most of which may be regulated by abscisic acid (ABA), ethylene, jasmonic acid (JA), and so on. Exogenous JA application showed a protective effect against Cu stress and significantly increased transcripts of the glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene. This study provides insight into the molecular mechanisms of Cu responses in higher plants."

"24906010","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the main fungal diseases limiting durum wheat production. This study aimed to characterize previously undescribed genes for leaf rust resistance in durum wheat. Six different resistant durum genotypes were crossed to two susceptible International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) lines and the resulting F1, F2, and F3 progenies were evaluated for leaf rust reactions in the field and under greenhouse conditions. In addition, allelism tests were conducted. The results of the study indicated that most genotypes carried single effective dominant or recessive seedling resistance genes; the only exception to this was genotype Gaza, which carried one adult plant and one seedling resistance gene. In addition, it was concluded that the resistance genes identified in the current study were neither allelic to LrCamayo or Lr61, nor were they related to Lr3 or Lr14a, the genes that already are either ineffective or are considered to be vulnerable for breeding purposes. A complicated allelic or linkage relationship between the identified genes is discussed. The results of the study will be useful for breeding for durable resistance by creating polygenic complexes."

"24046204","abstracttext","The fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust, is an obligate biotrophic basidiomycete. Many studies have found that myosins play important roles during fungal growth and propagation. However, there are few reports on the myosins of Pst. In this study, we cloned and obtained the myosin light chain gene PsMLC1 from Pst and characterized its expression. Furthermore, the function of PsMLC1 was identified by mutant complementation. As a result, we found that expression of PsMLC1 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe mostly complemented the defects of the cdc4 mutant, indicating that PsMLC1 belongs to the myosin light chain family member. Expression studies showed that the transcript levels of PsMLC1 little changed before 24 h post inoculation then was suddenly down-regulated during Pst infection of wheat. By using ML-7, we observed that inactivity of PsMLC1 greatly reduced the germination rate of urediniospores. These results suggest that PsMLC1 is essential for the early stages of Pst infection of wheat but unnecessary for the later stages of infection. This work elucidates the function of the myosins in Pst and may provide some theoretical basis for controlling strip rust."

"24114216","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation and act as important endogenous regulators to various stressors. Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation is a major factor influencing crop growth and development. In this study, we isolated a novel wheat miRNA, named Tae-miR6000, and confirmed its expression diversity after UV-B treatments. Additionally, using the Northern blotting technique, we found that six miRNAs were highly responsive to UV-B stress in wheat. Of these six miRNAs, miR159, miR167a, and miR171 were significantly upregulated, and the remaining three miRNAs were downregulated, at different time points after UV-B treatment. This result indicates that miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of targets after induction by UV-B stress. Furthermore, promoter analysis of the UV-B-responsive miRNA genes revealed some light-relevant cis-elements, such as the I-box and G-box. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that wheat miRNAs play important roles in the response to UV-B stress."

"24202916","abstracttext","Genetic maps of chromosomes 3A, 3B and 3D of wheat and 3R of rye were developed using 22 DNA probes and two isozyme marker systems. Analysis of the 49 loci mapped showed extreme clustering around the centromere in all four maps, with large 'gaps' in the distal chromosome regions, which is interpreted as being due to strong localisation of recombination towards the ends of the wheat and rye chromosomes. In the centromeric regions gene orders are highly conserved between the three wheat genomes and the rye genome. However, the unpredictable behaviour of the DNA clones that map in distal chromosome locations may indicate that the genomes are diverging most rapidly in the regions of higher recombination. A comparison of cDNA and genomic probes showed the latter to be much more efficient for revealing RFLP. Some classes of gDNA clones, i.e. chromosome-specific sequences and those hybridizing in a non-homoeologous manner, were seen to be most polymorphic. Correlations between map locations and RFLP levels showed no clear relationship. In addition to anonymous DNA clones, the locations of known function clones, sedoheptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase (XSbp), carboxypeptidase I (XCxp1) and a bZIP protein (XEmbp), were ascertained along with those for two isozyme loci, Mal-1 and Est-5."

"24258847","abstracttext","Inheritance of gliadin components in winter wheat has been studied by one-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Single F2 grains from 36 intervarietal hybrid combinations have been analysed. The genetic analysis has revealed blocks, including 1-6 gliadin components, which are inherited as individual mendelian traits. About 80 variants of blocks have been detected. On the basis of the allelism test they are grouped into 6 series in accordance with the number of known gliadin-coding loci located on chromosomes of the homoeologous groups 1 and 6. Each series includes 8-18 blocks controlled by different alleles of one gliadin-coding locus. Blocks of components have been confirmed to be inherited codominantly in accordance to the gene dose in the triploid endosperm. The highest similarity between members of one series is observed in groups of blocks controlled by chromosomes ID and 6D. On the contrary, many blocks controlled by chromosomes 1A and 1B have no bands in common. The presented catalogue of blocks of components may be used to make up gliadin genetic formulae and to compare electrophoregrams obtained by different authors. Blocks of gliadin components are suitable genetic markers for use in revealing and studying heterogeneity of wheat varieties, in tracing their origin, in identifying recombinations, translocations and substitutions of the genetic material and in solving many other problems of the origin, evolution and selection of hexaploid wheat."
"24232810","articletitle","Hybrid necrosis in triticale and the expression of necrosis genes in allopolyploids."
"24232810","abstracttext","The occurrence in triticale of four different genes causing hybrid necrosis is described: Ne1 and Ne2 in the B genome of wheat and Ner1 and Ner2 in the rye genome. Hybrid necrosis develops due to dominant complementary interaction of two genes. This interaction in triticale, however, may take place not only between genes belonging to the same genome but also between genes of different genomes. In triticale, these genes can cause hybrid necrosis in four different combinations. The inheritance of the phenomenon in triticale is, therefore, more complicated than it is in wheat or rye. To avoid hybrid necrosis in triticale, attention should be paid that no necrosis genes are introduced into the primary triticale stocks from the wheat and rye parents. The expression of necrosis genes is influenced by the level of ploidy. Any additional genome - A, B, D, or R - may exert a suppressing effect on the expression of necrosis genes. Therefore, when identifying genotypes of triticale with regard to their necrosis genes, the level of ploidy has to be accounted for. Moreover, the present results illustrate that gene expression in polyploids is not only determined by interactions with other single genes but that it may also be modified by the total genotype of the respective individual."

"24173947","abstracttext","A species-specific repeated sequence, pHvNAU62, was cloned from Haynaldia villosa, a wheat relative of great importance. It strongly hybridized to H. villosa, but not to wheat. In situ hybridization localized this sequence to six of seven H. villosa chromosome pairs in telomeric or sub-telomeric regions. Southern hybridization to whea-H. villosa addition lines showed that chromosomes 1V through 6V gave strong signals in ladders while chromosome 7V escaped detection. In addition to H. villosa, several Triticeae species were identified for a high abundance of the pHvNAU62 repeated sequence, among which Thinopyrum bassarabicum and Leymus racemosus produced the strongest signals. Sequence analysis indicated that the cloned fragment was 292 bp long, being AT rich (61%), and showed 67% homology of pSc7235, a rye repeated sequence. Isochizomer analysis suggested that the present repeated sequence was heavily methylated at the cytosine of the CpG dimer in the genome of H. villosa.It was also demonstrated that pHvNAU62 is useful in tagging the introduced 6VS chromosome arm, which confers a resistance gene to wheat powdery mildew, in the segregating generations."

"24174032","abstracttext","The physical distribution of translocation breakpoints was analyzed in homoeologous recombinants involving chromosomes 1A, 1B, 1D of wheat and 1R of rye, and the long arms of chromosome 7S of Aegilops speltoides and 7A of wheat. Recombination between homoeologues was induced by removal of the Ph1 gene. In all instances, translocation breakpoints were concentrated in the distal ends of the chromosome arms and were absent in the proximal halves of the arms. The relationship between the relative distance from the centromere and the relative homoeologous recombination frequency was best explained by the function f(x)=0.0091e(0.0592x). The pattern of recombination in homoeologous chromosomes was essentially the same as in homologues except that there were practically no double exchanges. Among 313 recombinant chromosomes, only one resulted from a double crossing-over. The distribution of translocation breakpoints in translocated arms indicated that positive chiasma interference operated in homoeologous recombination. This implies that the reduction of the length of alien chromosome segments present in translocations with wheat chromosomes may be more difficult than the production of the original recombinants."

Two different promoters were used for err1 overexpression in both strains, a constitutive (the native pyruvat kinase (pki) promoter) and an inducible one (the native β-xylosidase (bxl1) promoter). The derived recombinant strains were precharacterized by analysis of err1 transcript formation on D-xylose and xylan. Based on this, one strain of each type was chosen for further investigation for erythritol production in shake flasks and in bioreactor experiments. For the latter, we used wheat straw pretreated by an alkaline organosolve process as lignocellulosic substrate. Shake flask experiments on D-xylose showed increased erythritol formation for both, the wild-type and the Rut-C30 overexpression strain compared to their respective parental strain. Bioreactor cultivations on wheat straw did not increase erythritol formation in the wild-type overexpression strain. However, err1 overexpression in Rut-C30 led to a clearly higher erythritol formation on wheat straw."

"24941327","abstracttext","To develop an effective biocontrol strategy for management of Fusarium head blight on wheat caused by Fusarium graminearum, the bacterial biocontrol agent Pcho10 was selected from more than 1,476 wheat-head-associated bacterial strains according to its antagonistic activity in vitro. This strain was subsequently characterized as Pseudomonas chlororaphis subsp. aurantiaca based on 16S ribosomal DNA sequence analysis, assays of the BIOLOG microbial identification system, and unique pigment production. The major antifungal metabolite produced by Pcho10 was further identified as phenazine-1-carboxamide (PCN) on the basis of nuclear magnetic resonance data. The core PCN biosynthesis gene cluster in Pcho10 was cloned and sequenced. PCN showed strong inhibitory activity against F. graminearum conidial germination, mycelial growth, and deoxynivalenol production. Tests both under growth chamber conditions and in field trials showed that Pcho10 well colonized on the wheat head and effectively controlled the disease caused by F. graminearum. Results of this study indicate that P. chlororaphis subsp. aurantiaca Pcho10 has high potential to be developed as a biocontrol agent against F. graminearum. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of P. chlororaphis for the management of Fusarium head blight."

"26187970","abstracttext","This study aimed at assessing the dynamics of lactic acid bacteria and other Firmicutes associated with durum wheat organs and processed products. 16S rRNA gene-based high-throughput sequencing showed that Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, Enterococcus, and Lactococcus were the main epiphytic and endophytic genera among lactic acid bacteria. Bacillus, Exiguobacterium, Paenibacillus, and Staphylococcus completed the picture of the core genus microbiome. The relative abundance of each lactic acid bacterium genus was affected by cultivars, phenological stages, other Firmicutes genera, environmental temperature, and water activity (aw) of plant organs. Lactobacilli, showing the highest sensitivity to aw, markedly decreased during milk development (Odisseo) and physiological maturity (Saragolla). At these stages, Lactobacillus was mainly replaced by Streptococcus, Lactococcus, and Enterococcus. However, a key sourdough species, Lactobacillus plantarum, was associated with plant organs during the life cycle of Odisseo and Saragolla wheat. The composition of the sourdough microbiota and the overall quality of leavened baked goods are also determined throughout the phenological stages of wheat cultivation, with variations depending on environmental and agronomic factors."

"26133735","abstracttext_key message","A new broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance allele Pm2c was identified and mapped in Chinese wheat landrace Niaomai. Chinese wheat landrace Niaomai showed resistance to 27 of 28 Chinese Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici (Bgt) races. Genetic analysis of an F2 population and its derived F2:3 families from the cross Niaomai × Mingxian 169 and backcross population, Niaomai/2*Mingxian 169, indicated that the resistance of Niaomai to Bgt races was conferred by a single dominant resistance gene, temporarily designated PmNM. Molecular tagging showed that PmNM was located on chromosome 5DS and flanked by SSR markers Xcfd81 and Xcfd78 with the genetic distances of 0.1/0.4 cM and 4.9/7.5 cM, respectively. Niaomai showed a different array of responses compared to lines with Pm2a, Pm2b, PmD57-5D, PmLX66, PmX3986-2 and Pm48 genes, sharing the same Xcfd81 allele but differing from Xcfd78 allele for Pm2a and Pm2b lines. Allelism tests based on crosses of Niaomai with Ulka/8*Cc and KM2939 showed that PmNM is allelic to Pm2a and Pm2b. We concluded that PmNM is a new allele of Pm2, re-designated Pm2c. Pm2c could be transferred into wheat cultivars by marker-assisted selection to improve the powdery mildew resistance of breeding cultivars/lines."

"25932661","abstracttext","Preharvest sprouting is a serious problem in grain crop production because it causes quality deterioration and economic losses. It is well known that grain colour is closely associated with grain dormancy in wheat; white-grained lines without accumulating proanthocyanidins in testa tend to be more susceptible to preharvest sprouting than red ones. All available white-grained wheat lines are restricted to triple recessive mutations at the R loci (R-A1, R-B1, and R-D1), but barley is known to have 11 independent loci conferring the proanthocyanidin-free grain phenotype. In this study, we evaluated the dormancy levels of anthocyanin/proanthocyanidin-free ant17 mutants. Three ant17 mutants showed the same levels of dormancy as their respective wild types. Sequencing of three independent ant17 alleles detected a point mutation within the coding regions of flavanone-3-hydroxylase (F3H), which are predicted to cause a premature stop codon at different sites. The F3H locus completely cosegregated with the Ant17 position on the chromosome arm 2HL. Expression of the barley F3H gene was observed in pigmented tissues, but not in nonpigmented roots and stems. This result indicates that wheat F3H may be a promising new target locus for breeding white-grained lines with a practical level of preharvest sprouting resistance."

"26804619","abstracttext_key message","SNP-based QTL mapping provided useful information for novel loci that can be used in breeding programs to control tillering and improve yield in wheat via marker-assisted selection. Tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits affecting biomass and grain yield potential in wheat. Wheat lines with very limited tillering capacity are more productive than free-tillering lines under severe drought conditions. In this study, three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations were generated and used, having H461, a low-tillering genotype, as a common parent. A linkage map containing 7808 single nucleotide polymorphism loci was constructed on the basis of H461/CN16 RIL population. Three QTL controlling low tillering were identified on Chromosome (Chr.) 2D (Qltn.sicau-2D), Chr. 2B (Qltn.sicau-2B), and Chr. 5A (Qltn.sicau-5A). Qltn.sicau-2D, Qltn.sicau-2B, and Qltn.sicau-5A explained up to 19.1, 14.6, and 9.6 % of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Comparing with previous findings, Qltn.sicau-2D and Qltn.sicau-2B should thus be novel tillering QTL. The effects of these QTL were further validated in two additional RIL populations. Significant effects of Qltn.sicau-2D were detected across all growth stages in different genetic backgrounds, making it an ideal target for breeding programs as well as for further characterization of the gene(s) underlying this locus."

"26743986","abstracttext","Plant height is an important agronomic trait in cereal crops, and can affect both plant architecture and grain yield. New dwarfing genes are required for improving the genetic diversity of wheat. In this study, a novel dwarf mutant, NM9, was created by treating seeds of the wheat variety NAU9918 with ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS). NM9 showed obvious phenotypic changes, which were distinct from those caused by other dwarfing genes, especially the reduced plant height, increased effective tiller number, and elongated spike and grain length. The reduced plant height in NM9 was attributable to a semi-dominant dwarfing gene Rht_NM9, which was flanked by two closely linked SNP markers, SNP34 and SNP41, covering an 8.86-Mb region on the chromosome arm 2AS. The results of gibberellic acid (GA) sensitivity evaluation, comparative genomics analysis and allelism test indicated that Rht_NM9 was neither allelic to Rht7 and Rht21 nor homoeoallelic to Rht8, so Rht_NM9 was proposed to be a new dwarfing locus on the homoeologous group 2 chromosomes of wheat. Rht_NM9 has a negative effect on plant height and positive effects on effective tiller number and grain size, thus, Rht_NM9 could be used for elucidating the mechanisms underlying plant architecture and grain development."

"27141757","abstracttext","Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph: Zymoseptoria tritici, formerly Septoria tritici), the responsible for Septoria tritici blotch, is the most frequently occurring disease on wheat crops worldwide. The populations of this pathogen were previously characterized in several areas around the world, but not in Algeria so far. The present study aims thus at investigating the genetic diversity and population structure of M. graminicola in this country. One hundred and twenty monoconidial isolates of this fungus (60 from bread wheat and 60 from durum wheat) were collected during the 2012 growing season from five distinct geographical locations in Algeria. They were then fingerprinted using eight microsatellite markers. The number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 11, with an average of 6.25 alleles per locus. We found out a moderate gene diversity, a high genotype diversity (72% of unique haplotypes) and a low population differentiation within the population. Further analyses using both UPGMA and Bayesian clustering methods confirmed the lack of genetic structuration irrespective of geographical locations and host species. These findings are likely due to the frequent occurrence of sexual reproduction in the field, leading to genetic diversification and allele homogenization via wind born ascospores within the population."

"26801965","abstracttext","Multiparent Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) mapping populations offer unique opportunities and challenges for marker and QTL mapping in crop species. We have constructed the first eight-parent MAGIC genetic map for wheat, comprising 18 601 SNP markers. We validated the accuracy of our map against the wheat genome sequence and found an improvement in accuracy compared to published genetic maps. Our map shows a notable increase in precision resulting from the three generations of intercrossing required to create the population. This is most pronounced in the pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes. Sixteen percent of mapped markers exhibited segregation distortion (SD) with many occurring in long (>20 cM) blocks. Some of the longest and most distorted blocks were collinear with noncentromeric high-marker-density regions of the genome, suggesting they were candidates for introgression fragments introduced into the bread wheat gene pool from other grass species. We investigated two of these linkage blocks in detail and found strong evidence that one on chromosome 4AL, showing SD against the founder Robigus, is an interspecific introgression fragment. The completed map is available from http://www.niab.com/pages/id/326/Resources."

However, there is a lack of detailed information regarding molecular mechanism imparting tolerance to high salinity in this bread wheat. In the present study, differential root transcriptome analysis identifying salt stress responsive gene networks and functional annotation under salt stress in Kharchia Local was performed. A total of 453,882 reads were obtained after quality filtering, using Roche 454-GS FLX Titanium sequencing technology. From these reads 22,241 ESTs were generated out of which, 17,911 unigenes were obtained. A total of 14,898 unigenes were annotated against nr protein database. Seventy seven transcription factors families in 826 unigenes and 11,002 SSRs in 6,939 unigenes were identified. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database identified 310 metabolic pathways. The expression pattern of few selected genes was compared during the time course of salt stress treatment between salt-tolerant (Kharchia Local) and susceptible (HD2687). The transcriptome data is the first report, which offers an insight into the mechanisms and genes involved in salt tolerance. This information can be used to improve salt tolerance in elite wheat cultivars and to develop tolerant germplasm for other cereal crops."

"27242843","abstracttext","Genomic attempts were undertaken to elucidate the plant developmental responses to heat stress, and to characterize the roles of B2 protein in mediating those responses. A wheat expressed sequence tag for B2 protein was identified which was cloned and characterized to assess its functional relevance causing plant growth and development during stress adaptation. Here, we show that wheat B2 protein is highly expressed in root and shoot tissues as well as in developing seed tissues under high temperature stress conditions. Morphological studies of transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing gene encoding wheat B2 protein and Δb2 mutant plants were studied at major developmental stages. The stunted growth phenotype of mutant plants, together with hypocotyl and root elongation analysis of transgenic plants showed that B2 protein exhibits a crucial role in plant growth and development. Additional physiological analyses highlights the role of B2 protein in increased tolerance to heat and cold stresses by maintaining high chlorophyll content, strong activity of photosystem II and less membrane damage of overexpression transgenics as compared with the wild-type. Furthermore, the constitutive overexpression of TaB2 in Arabidopsis resulted in ABA hypersensitivity. Taken together, these studies suggest a novel perspectives of B2 protein in plant development and in mediating the thermal stress tolerance."

RjAxh43B released only arabinose from arabinoxylan and 2 3 ,3 3 -di-α-l-arabinofuranosyl xylotriose, but not 3 2 -α-l-arabinofuranosyl xylobiose or 2 3 -α-l-arabinofuranosyl xylotriose, strongly suggesting that RjAxh43B is an arabinoxylan α-l-1,3-arabinofuranohydrolase capable of cleaving α-1,3-linked arabinose residues of doubly arabinosylated xylan. When Axh43B was mixed with the recombinant scaffolding protein RjCipA of R. josui at a molar ratio of 6:1, the activity of the RjAxh43B-RjCipA complex (6:1) toward insoluble wheat arabinoxylan was similar to that of RjAxh43B alone, suggesting that RjAxh43B does not show a proximity effect, which is defined as an activity enhancement effect caused by the presence of plural catalytic subunits adjoining each other. When RjAxh43A was mixed with xylanase RjXyn10C, they acted synergistically toward insoluble wheat arabinoxylan and rice straw powder in the absence of RjCipA. Furthermore, the RjAxh43B-RjXyn10C-RjCipA (3:3:3) complex had higher activity toward insoluble wheat arabinoxylan than a mixture of RjAxh43B and RjXyn10C without RjCipA, suggesting that incorporation of a xylanase and an α-l-arabinofuranosidase into a cellulosome is beneficial for more efficiently degrading arabinoxylan."

"28436098","abstracttext","Plant sense potential microbial pathogen using pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). The Lectin receptor-like kinase genes (LecRKs) are involved in various cellular processes mediated by signal transduction pathways. In the present study, an L-type lectin receptor kinase gene LecRK-V was cloned from Haynaldia villosa, a diploid wheat relative which is highly resistant to powdery mildew. The expression of LecRK-V was rapidly up-regulated by Bgt inoculation and chitin treatment. Its transcript level was higher in the leaves than in roots, culms, spikes and callus. Single-cell transient overexpression of LecRK-V led to decreased haustorium index in wheat variety Yangmai158, which is powdery mildew susceptible. Stable transformation LecRK-V into Yangmai158 significantly enhanced the powdery mildew resistance at both seedling and adult stages. At seedling stage, the transgenic line was highly resistance to 18 of the tested 23 Bgt isolates, hypersensitive responses (HR) were observed for 22 Bgt isolates, and more ROS at the Bgt infection sites was accumulated. These indicated that LecRK-V confers broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew, and ROS and SA pathways contribute to the enhanced powdery mildew resistance in wheat."

In this study, durum wheat response to N chronic starvation during grain filling was investigated through a transcriptomic approach in roots, leaves/stems, flag leaf and spikes of cv. Svevo. Nitrogen stress negatively influenced plant height, tillering, flag leaf area, spike and seed traits, and total N content. RNA-seq data revealed 4,626 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Most transcriptomic changes were observed in roots, with 3,270 DEGs, while 963 were found in leaves/stems, 470 in flag leaf, and 355 in spike tissues. A total of 799 gene ontology (GO) terms were identified, 180 and 619 among the upregulated and downregulated genes, respectively. Among the most addressed GO categories, N compound metabolism, carbon metabolism, and photosynthesis were mostly represented. Interesting DEGs, such as N transporters, genes involved in N assimilation, along with transcription factors, protein kinases and other genes related to stress were highlighted. These results provide valuable information about the transcriptomic response to chronic N stress in durum wheat, which could be useful for future improvement of N use efficiency."

"27538701","abstracttext","The results of phylogenetic analyses revealed that the family of plant PDI may comprise of at least eight different subfamilies with varying numbers and positions of active centers while retention signals in the endoplasmic reticulum may be present or absent. At least one gene has been cloned for each phylogenetic group. Other phylogenetic analyses have indicated that the family of PDIlike proteins consists of ten classes, the first five of which include proteins equipped with two thioredoxin domains. These results indicate complexity and diversity of the family of protein disulfide isomerase in plants. The study of molecular characteristics of PDI in some cereal species have shown that this enzyme participates in the maturation of secretory proteins and also in the formation of albuminous substances in endosperm, in the mechanism of formation of disulfide bonds and polymerization of gluten polypeptides in wheat. The mechanism of formation of disulfide linkage was tested through in vitro experiments. However, it is not entirely certain whether it reflects their formation in vivo. The results of researches suggest that protein folding and disulfide bond formation occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum. PDI plays a prominent role among enzymes involved in posttranslational modification of proteins. The main goal of this work is to present research data on protein disulfide isomerase, which may be a leading research objective in the area of wheat gluten and the impact of PDI on the baking quality of wheat flour."

"27565003","abstracttext","For almost a century, the wheat Lr34 gene has conferred durable resistance against fungal rust diseases. While sequence homology predicts a putative ATP binding cassette transporter, the molecules that are transported (allocrites) by the encoded LR34 variants, and any associated mechanism of resistance, remain enigmatic. Here, the in vitro transport characteristics of 2 naturally occurring Lr34 variants (that differ in their ability to mediate disease resistance; Lr34sus and Lr34res) are investigated. Initially, a method to express and purify recombinant LR34Sus and LR34Res pseudo half-molecules from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is described. Subsequently, a semi-targeted chlorophyll catabolite (CC) extraction from Lr34res-expressing wheat plants was performed based on previous reports highlighting increased accumulation of CCs in Lr34res-expressing flag leaves. Following partial biochemical characterization, this extract was applied to an LR34 in vitro proteoliposome transport assay. Mass spectroscopic analyses of transported metabolites revealed that LR34Sus imported a wheat metabolite of 618 Da and that the LR34Res transporter did not. While the identity of the LR34Sus transported metabolite remains to be confirmed and any allocrites of LR34Res remain to be detected, this work demonstrates that these variants have different allocrite preferences, a finding that may be relevant to the mechanism of disease resistance."

There is substantial interest in breeding and managing crops that host root microbial communities that increase productivity. The eudicot model species Arabidopsis has been used to investigate these processes, however a model for monocotyledons is also required. We characterized the rhizosphere microbiome and root exudates of Brachypodium distachyon, to develop it as a rhizosphere model for cereal species like wheat. The Brachypodium rhizosphere microbial community was dominated by Burkholderiales. However, these communities were also dependent on how tightly they were bound to roots, the root type they were associated with (nodal or seminal roots), and their location along the roots. Moreover, the functional gene categories detected in microorganisms isolated from around root tips differed from those isolated from bases of roots. The Brachypodium rhizosphere microbiota and root exudate profiles were similar to those reported for wheat rhizospheres, and different to Arabidopsis. The differences in root system development and cell wall chemistry between monocotyledons and eudicots may also influence the microorganism composition of these major plant types. Brachypodium is a promising model for investigating the microbiome of wheat."

In the present work a breeding strategy aiming to produce a set of SSIIa (starch synthases IIa) null durum wheat is described. We have characterized major traits such as seed weight, total starch, amylose, protein and β-glucan content in a set of mutant families derived from the introgression of the SSIIa null trait into Svevo, an elite Italian durum wheat cultivar. A large degree of variability was detected and used to select wheat lines with either improved quality traits or agronomic performances. Semolina of a set of two SSIIa null lines showed new rheological behavior and an increased content of all major dietary fiber components, namely arabinoxylans, β-glucans and resistant starch. Furthermore the investigation of gene expression highlighted important differences in some genes involved in starch and β-glucans biosynthesis."

Transgenic plants expressing heterologous phytase are expected to enhance degradation of phytic acid stored in seeds and are proposed to increase the in vitro bioavailability of mineral nutrients. Wheat transgenic plants expressing Aspergillus japonicus phytase gene (phyA) in wheat endosperm were developed till T 3 generation. The transgenic lines exhibited 18-99 % increase in phytase activity and 12-76 % reduction of phytic acid content in seeds. The minimum phytic acid content was observed in chapatti (Asian bread) as compared to flour and dough. The transcript profiling of phyA mRNA indicated twofold to ninefold higher expression as compared to non transgenic controls. There was no significant difference in grain nutrient composition of transgenic and non-transgenic seeds. In vitro bioavailability assay for iron and zinc in dough and chapatti of transgenic lines revealed a significant increase in iron and zinc contents.

Moderate leaf rolling maintains the erectness of leaves and minimizes shadowing between leaves, leading to improved photosynthetic efficiency. Although some genes controlling leaf rolling have been isolated from rice and other plant species, few studies have examined leaf rolling in wheat. In the present study, the leaf rolling regulator gene, TaMYB18, was identified in a large-scale transgene project involving the transformation of 1455 wheat transcription factor genes into rice. Three homologous sequences of TaMYB18 were isolated from hexaploid wheat and localized to chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D, respectively. TaMYB18, an R2R3-MYB transcription factor, localized to the nucleus. TaMYB18 overexpression induced leaf rolling in transgenic rice. Additionally, the three members of TaMYB18 exhibited functional redundancy in rice. Furthermore, the function of TaMYB18 in regulating leaf rolling in rice was a dose-dependent. Taken together, these results indicate that TaMYB18 may play an important role in the regulation of leaf development."

"27859852","abstracttext","Winter hardiness is important for the adaptation of wheat to the harsh winter conditions in temperate regions and is thus also an important breeding goal. Here, we employed a panel of 407 European winter wheat cultivars to dissect the genetic architecture of winter hardiness. We show that copy number variation (CNV) of CBF (C-repeat Binding Factor) genes at the Fr-A2 locus is the essential component for winter survival, with CBF-A14 CNV being the most likely causal polymorphism, accounting for 24.3% of the genotypic variance. Genome-wide association mapping identified several markers in the Fr-A2 chromosomal region, which even after accounting for the effects of CBF-A14 copy number explained approximately 15% of the genotypic variance. This suggests that additional, as yet undiscovered, polymorphisms are present at the Fr-A2 locus. Furthermore, CNV of Vrn-A1 explained an additional 3.0% of the genotypic variance. The allele frequencies of all loci associated with winter hardiness were found to show geographic patterns consistent with their role in adaptation. Collectively, our results from the candidate gene analysis, association mapping and genome-wide prediction show that winter hardiness in wheat is a quantitative trait, but with a major contribution of the Fr-A2 locus."
