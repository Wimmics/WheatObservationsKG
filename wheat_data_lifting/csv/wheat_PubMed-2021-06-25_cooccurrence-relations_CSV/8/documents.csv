"7936661","articletitle","Characterization of the expression of the Cek8 receptor-type tyrosine kinase during development and in tumor cell lines."
"7936661","abstracttext","Cek8 is a receptor-type tyrosine kinase gene that was identified by screening a 10 day chicken embryo library with a DNA probe corresponding to the related kinase Cek4 (Sajjadi & Pasquale, 1993). Here we report the characterization of the Cek8 protein and its expression in embryonic tissues and tumor cell lines. The 120 kd Cek8 protein is detected early in embryogenesis, is developmentally regulated and preferentially, but not exclusively, expressed in neural tissues. In the stage 24 chick embryo, Cek8 immunoreactivity is prominent in the spinal cord and spinal nerves. At embryonic day 6, Cek8 expression becomes concentrated to the ventral portion of the spinal nerves, suggesting a role in axonogenesis of specific subsets of neurons. Cek8 is expressed in nearly all of the tumor cell lines examined, including cell lines derived from tumors of the central nervous system. Although the phosphorylation on tyrosine of Cek8 during development is moderate or undetectable, Cek8 is substantially phosphorylated on tyrosine (and thus presumably activated) in many of the transformed cell lines. Because of its high frequency of expression in tumor cell lines, Cek8 differs from previously investigated Eph-related kinases. However, as we show, Cek8 is not unique among the Eph-related kinases: another member of the Eph subclass, Cek5, has similar patterns of expression and phosphorylation in tumor cells. Based on its binding to a variety of lectin columns, Cek8 contains complex N-linked oligosaccharides. Cross-linking of Cek8 molecules on the cell surface with wheat germ agglutinin caused their rapid phosphorylation on tyrosine. Autophosphorylation on tyrosine is typically the first step in the activation of a receptor tyrosine kinase by a ligand."
"7938001","articletitle","Activation of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat in THP-1 cells by a staphylococcal extracellular product."
"7938001","abstracttext","Staphylococcal strains can release a factor that strongly activates the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) long terminal repeat (LTR) in THP-1 cells transfected with the HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase reporter gene (THP-1 LTRluc). The factor is present in the overnight culture fluid and is readily released from the organisms into aqueous medium by vigorous mixing. Staphylococcal extracellular material is a complex mixture of polysaccharide and protein containing peptidoglycan and teichoic acid, released in part by cell wall turnover. The importance of the carbohydrate component is emphasized by concanavalin A (Con A) inhibition of staphylococcal product-induced LTR activation but not of activation by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or tumor necrosis factor. The effect of Con A was decreased or abolished by sugars in the order methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside > methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside > mannose > glucose = fructose > N-acetylglucosamine. Wheat germ agglutinin was less inhibitory than Con A; in this instance N-acetylglucosamine decreased inhibition, whereas methyl alpha-D-mannopyranoside or methyl alpha-D-glucopyranoside did not. The induction of luciferase activity in THP-1 LTRluc by the staphylococcal extracellular product also was inhibited by fetal bovine and normal human serum. A comparison of 31 staphylococcal isolates (9 Staphylococcus aureus, 11 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 2 Staphylococcus haemolyticus, 4 Staphylococcus hominis, 2 Staphylococcus capitis, 2 Staphylococcus warneri, 1 Staphylococcus saprophyticus) revealed wide variation in LTR activating activity that did not correlate closely with slime production. Our findings, using induction of luciferase in THP-1 LTRluc as a model for upregulation of HIV infection, raise the possibility that staphylococci, as well as certain other microorganisms, release carbohydrate-containing exopolymers, which can activate the HIV-1 LTR, thus influencing progression of HIV infection."
"7972496","articletitle","Organ-specific and hormone-dependent expression of genes for serine carboxypeptidases during development and following germination of rice grains."
"7972496","abstracttext","Several cDNA clones encoding either serine carboxypeptidases or related proteins of Oryza sativa L. were identified, and the abundance of the corresponding mRNA in immature and germinated grains was examined. The deduced amino acid sequence of each cDNA included key sequences, such as a pentapeptide (G-X-S-X-G/A) that is conserved among many serine carboxypeptidases, and the putative protein products were classified as two general and one novel type of cereal serine carboxypeptidases. Two general types exhibited considerable homology to type I and type III carboxypeptidases of cereal plants. The novel type encoded a serine carboxypeptidase-like protein that was very similar to type III carboxypeptidases of barley and wheat but had slight differences in both the N- and the C-terminal sequences. The mRNAs of each of these carboxypeptidases were observed in immature grains, and they decreased during maturation. The abundance of mRNA for each class of carboxypeptidase increased again following germination with the same time course and in a tissue-specific manner. The mRNAs for type I and type III-like carboxypeptidases were abundant in germinated embryos composed of leaf, root, and scutellum, whereas the mRNA for type III carboxypeptidase was conspicuous in endosperm that contained the aleurone layer. Altered amounts of mRNA in deembryonated half-grains in response to phytohormones, such as gibberellic acid and abscisic acid, were only detectable in the case of type III carboxypeptidase. Southern blot analysis using rice genomic DNA revealed the simple organization of each gene for these three classes of carboxypeptidases."
"7964624","articletitle","Complete nucleotide sequence of peanut clump virus RNA 1 and relationships with other fungus-transmitted rod-shaped viruses."
"7964624","abstracttext","The complete nucleotide sequence of RNA 1 of the tentative furovirus peanut clump virus (PCV) has been determined by characterization of cloned cDNA and by direct RNA sequencing. The sequence is 5897 nucleotides in length and contains three long open reading frames (ORFs). The 5'-terminal proximal ORF has the potential to encode a polypeptide of M(r) 130942 (P131) containing methyltransferase and RNA helicase homologous domains and displaying homology with large nonstructural proteins of alpha-like viruses, which are known or thought to be involved in virus replication. The P131 ORF is followed in-frame by a second ORF which is probably expressed by partial readthrough of the UGA termination codon of the P131 ORF to produce a polypeptide of M(r) 191044 (P191). The readthrough region of P191 contains the characteristic 'core' RNA polymerase motif, indicating that the PCV replicase proteins are expressed as a pair of overlapping proteins as in the tobamoviruses, tobraviruses and the furovirus soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV). Sequence comparisons indicate that P131 and P191 are most closely related to the replicase proteins of SBWMV and the hordeivirus barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) but are only distantly related to the replicase of the furovirus beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV). The 3'-terminal proximal ORF can encode a putative polypeptide of M(r) 14556 (P15) which displays homology to small cysteine-rich proteins of hordeiviruses and SBWMV. We have corrected four errors in the sequence of PCV RNA 2 published previously by Manohar et al. (Virology 195, 33-41, 1993). One of these changes causes two small ORFs near the 3' terminus of RNA 2 to be fused together to create an ORF for a putative polypeptide of M(r) 16833 (P17) which displays extensive homology with the third protein of the triple gene block of BSMV RNA beta."
"7832779","articletitle","An extracellular domain of the beta subunit is essential for processing, transport and kinase activity of insulin receptor."
"7832779","abstracttext","The extracellular portion of the insulin receptor (IR) beta-subunit has four cysteine and four asparagine residues which are potentially involved in disulphide bond formation between the alpha- and beta-subunits and N-linked glycosylation respectively. However, the function of this portion is not fully understood. In order to investigate the role of the extracellular domain of beta-subunit, we created a deletion mutant of IR cDNA which lacked 47 amino acid residues encoded by 141 bp corresponding to exon 13 of the IR gene. Insulin binding and surface labelling of COS 7 cells transiently expressing the mutant insulin receptors (IR delta Ex13) showed that the mutated receptors were not expressed on the cell surface. However, immunoblot analysis showed that uncleaved form (190 kDa) of the mutant receptors were intracellularly expressed. Deglycosylation with endoglycosidase H showed that the mutant receptors had mainly high-mannose oligosaccharide chains. The mutant IRs bound with high affinity to lentil lectin but with low affinity to wheat germ agglutinin. Therefore, it is suggested that misfolding of the mutant receptors inhibits transport to the Golgi apparatus where processing of oligosaccharide chains, as well as proteolytic cleavage into subunits, takes place. The binding affinity of the mutant receptors for insulin was 50% of normal. Furthermore, insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of IR delta Ex13 was markedly impaired. These data provide the evidence for a critical role of the extracellular domain of IR beta-subunit for processing and transport as well as the intramolecular signal transduction to activate IR tyrosine kinase."
"7881181","articletitle","Sialylation and malignant potential in tumour cell glycosylation mutants."
"7881181","abstracttext","Somatic mutations and drugs that either reduce beta 1-6GlcNAc-branching of N-linked oligosaccharides or block the addition of terminal sequences containing galactose and sialic acid have been shown to inhibit tumour growth and metastasis. In an attempt to further define the oligosaccharide sequences that contribute to the malignant phenotype, we have selected spontaneous wheat germ agglutinin-resistant (WGAR) mutants from highly metastatic murine lymphoid tumour cells and characterized four mutant phenotypes. Mutants were selected from VM4, a clone of the MDAY-D2 tumour cell line which had been transfected with the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene (LacZ). VM4 cells retained the malignant phenotype of MDAY-D2 and the cells expressed LacZ, which facilitated the counting of metastases as the tumour cells stained blue when incubated with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl beta-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal). The most frequently isolated mutant was defective in the transport of UDP-Gal into the Golgi, and as previously observed for this mutation, the cells were non-metastatic and produced very slow-growing solid tumours. Mutants expressing CMP-SA hydroxylase, and consequently glycoconjugates with N-glycolylneuraminic acid (NeuNGc), remained highly metastatic, but grew more slowly than VM4 cells as s.c. tumours in mice. A novel WGAR mutant showing a large increase in Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc:alpha 2-6 sialyltransferase (SA-T) mRNA levels (ST6N) and enzyme activity was observed to be less metastatic and also grew more slowly at the s.c. site of inoculation. Finally, a fourth phenotypic class of WGAR mutants showed a complex phenotype including expression of a beta Gal-binding cell surface lectin and reduced sialylation of glycoconjugates. These results suggest that changes in either the amount, the type or linkage of sialic acid in tumour cell glycoconjugates can affect tumour growth and metastasis."
"7744618","articletitle","HLA-DQ2-restricted T-cell recognition of gluten-derived peptides in celiac disease. Influence of amino acid substitutions in the membrane distal domain of DQ beta 1*0201."
"7744618","abstracttext","CD is precipitated in susceptible individuals by ingestion of wheat gluten. The disease is strongly associated to the HLA-DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) (DQ2) heterodimer, where both the DQ alpha and DQ beta chains are required for susceptibility. We have recently shown that gluten-specific CD4+ T cells from the small intestinal mucosa of CD patients are predominantly restricted by the CD-associated HLA-DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) heterodimer. Here we report studies on the influence of aa substitutions in the DQ beta 1*0201 chain on DQ2-restricted T-cell recognition of gluten antigens. A B-LCL expressing the DQ(alpha 1*501, beta 1*0301) heterodimer was transfected with the DQB1*0201 gene, or with DQB1*0201 genes altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Surface expression of the wild-type or mutated DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) heterodimers was observed in the transfectants. Seven DQ2-restricted, gluten-specific TCCs were then investigated with respect to their ability to recognize antigen presented by the transfectants. All TCCs were sensitive to one or more of the aa substitutions induced but showed different response patterns. The results demonstrate that single aa substitutions of the DQ beta 1*0201 chain at positions in the peptide-binding cleft of DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) may affect binding of gluten-derived peptides and/or interfere with T-cell recognition. Because all seven TCCs studied were differently affected, they probably differ with respect to glutenpeptide and/or DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) restriction fine specificity."
"7704046","articletitle","Comparison of the effects of N6-methyldeoxyadenosine and N5-methyldeoxycytosine on transcription from nuclear gene promoters in barley."
"7704046","abstracttext","Methylation of deoxycytosine residues in plant nuclear DNA at CpG dinucleotides is generally assumed to suppress transcription, while deoxyadenosine methylation on recombinant reporter gene constructs transiently introduced into plant cells increases expression by uncharacterized mechanisms. A particle bombardment transient expression system was used in intact barley aleurone layers to quantitate the effects of CpG and A methylation on transcription from well-characterized hormone-regulated alpha-amylase promoters. Methylation of C in all CpG pairs had little effect on transcription. In contrast, the presence of methylated A residues in the sequence GATC scattered in the reporter plasmid outside of the promoter increased transcription two- to fivefold, regardless of the strength of the promoter, and proper hormonal regulation of transcription was maintained. The methyl-dA effect was similar when the amount of reporter construct DNA used was varied over a 20-fold range, beginning with an amount that gave only a small increment of expression above background. Similar enhancing effects for methyl-dA were seen with the CaMV 35S, maize Adh1, and maize ubiquitin promoters, though the magnitude varied for each individual promoter. Methyl-dA did not detectably affect plasmid DNA stability in aleurone cells in transient expression experiments because the enhancing effect of methyl-dA on expression was the same regardless of whether the assay was performed at 12 h or 40 h. Several proteins in wheat germ nuclear extracts bound preferentially to methylated DNA as assessed by gel retardation assays; one showed preferential binding to methyl-dA rather than methyl-CpG residues. The data indicate that the presence of methyl-dA in the vicinity of active promoters enhances transcription of nuclear genes in barley in a manner independent of the strength of the promoter. This effect may be mediated by a methyl-dA-binding protein."
"7724671","articletitle","Purification and cDNA isolation of chloroplastic phosphoglycerate kinase from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii."
"7724671","abstracttext","Chloroplastic phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) was purified to homogeneity from a soluble fraction of chloroplasts of a cell-wall-deficient mutant strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (cw-15) using ammonium sulfate fractionation, Reactive Blue-72 column chromatography, and native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PGK activity was attributed to a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 42 kD. Relative purity and identity of the isolated enzyme was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequence determination. Antiserum against this enzyme was raised and a western blot analysis of whole-cell lysate from cw-15 cells using this anti-chloroplastic PGK serum detected a single polypeptide with a molecular mass of 42 kD. The cDNA clone corresponding to the Chlamydomonas chloroplastic PGK was isolated from a Chlamydomonas cDNA expression library using the anti-PGK serum. The cDNA sequence was determined and apparently codes for the entire precursor peptide, which consists of 461 codons. The results from Southern and northern blot analyses suggest that the chloroplastic PGK gene exists as a single copy in the nuclear genome of C. reinhardtii and is expressed as a 1.8-kb transcript. The C. reinhardtii chloroplastic PGK cDNA has 71 and 66% homology with wheat chloroplastic PGK and spinach chloroplastic PGK, respectively. Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, the chloroplastic PGK of C. reinhardtii has more similarity to plant PGKs than to other PGKs, having both prokaryotic and eukaryotic features."
"8025823","articletitle","A nuclear factor that binds to a dyad-symmetric sequence with a CGTCA motif in the 5'-upstream region of the sweet potato beta-amylase gene."
"8025823","abstracttext","A nuclear extract from petioles of sweet potato protected several sites in the 5'-upstream region of a gene for beta-amylase from DNase I digestion. One of these sites, located at a region around 800-base pairs upstream from the transcription start site, having an imperfect palindromic sequence of CGTCACGTCACG, was designated the R-box. The site contained tandemly duplicated CGTCA sequences, referred to below as 5'- and 3'-CGTCA. Competition experiments in gel mobility shift assays with mutant R-box oligonucleotides indicated that mutations in bases outside the 3'-CGTCA of the R-box do not severely affect the binding. By contrast, single-base substitutions in any one base of the 3'-CGTCA greatly abolished the binding even when the mutated R-boxes contained intact 5'-CGTCA. However, oligonucleotides with mutations in the 3'-CGTCA had the ability to bind the nuclear factor when additional mutations were introduced to create a partially palindromic sequence containing the CGTCA sequence in its 3'-half on the opposite strand. These results indicate that the CGTCA sequence alone is not sufficient for the binding of the R-box binding factor (RBF) and that the RBF binds to the sequence with partial dyad symmetry that contains the CGTCA motif in its 3'-half. The optimum sequence for the binding of the RBF is suggested to be a palindromic octameric sequence TGACGTCA, which is identical to the consensus sequence of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE) of animal genes. Bacterially produced HBP-1b of wheat bound to the R-box, and its binding to mutated R-boxes was similar to that of RBF, suggesting that the RBF belongs to a family of bZIP-type plant nuclear factors that bind to CGTCA-related sequences. However, several differences between the RBF and HBP-1b were also noted."
"7829517","articletitle","Identification, purification, and characterization of cell-surface retention sequence-binding proteins from human SK-Hep cells and bovine liver plasma membranes."
"7829517","abstracttext","Cell-surface retention is a newly identified mechanism associated with the secretion of certain polypeptide growth factors and cytokines. This novel form of secretion appears to be mediated by cell-surface retention sequences (CRS) in the polypeptide molecules. To test the hypothesis that high-affinity CRS-binding proteins (CRS-BPs) are responsible for the cell-surface retention, we identified and characterized the high-affinity binding sites on various cell types for 125I-labeled CRS peptide (sis) and CRS peptide (VEGF), each of which contained the putative CRS motifs of platelet-derived growth factor B (c-sis) and vascular endothelial cell growth factor, respectively. Scatchard plot analysis revealed a single class of high-affinity binding sites with Kd = 0.5-0.7 nM and approximately 22,000-55,000 sites/cell. High-affinity binding activity could be demonstrated between pH 4.5 and 8.0, but was much greater below 6.0 (maximum pH 5.0-5.5). The ligand binding activity was inhibited by heparin, polylysine, and protamine, but not by cytochrome c. CRS-BPs responsible for the high-affinity binding were identified as 60-72-kDa proteins by ligand affinity labeling. CRS-BPs were purified from human SK-Hep cells and bovine liver plasma membranes by Triton X-100 extraction followed by affinity column chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 4B and CRS peptide (sis)-Affi-Gel 10. Purified CRS-BPs exhibited ligand binding properties (pH profile and inhibitor sensitivity) similar to those of the high-affinity binding sites for CRS peptides on cultured cells. The major CRS-BPs (p60, p66, and p72) purified from bovine liver plasma membranes were found to have identical N-terminal amino acid sequence and were assumed to represent different forms of the same gene product, which we have designated CRS-BP1."
"6929521","articletitle","Regulation of protein synthesis during spore germination in Dictyostelium discoideum."
"6929521","abstracttext","Spore germination in the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum is a particularly suitable paradigm for studying the regulation of gene expression because developmentally regulated changes in both protein and mRNA synthesis occur during the synchronous transition from dormant spore to growing ameba. To investigate the regulation of protein synthesis during germination, we labeled activated spores with [35S]methionine at 1-hr intervals during germination, until amebas emerged (at 3 hr). The labeled proteins were resolved by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Six classes of proteins were distinguished, depending on the time of onset and duration of their synthesis: (i) proteins made only during the first hour of germination, (ii) proteins made during the second hour, (iii) proteins made during the third hour, (iv) those synthesized only between 1 and 3 hr after activation, (v) peptides made only between 0 and 2 hr after activation, and (vi) proteins that were made throughout germination, mRNA isolated from dormant spores and from spores at different stages of germination was translated in a wheat germ cell-free protein-synthesizing system, and the proteins made in vitro were compared to those synthesized in vivo. The majority of the changes in the pattern of protein synthesis that occurred during the different stages of germination were attributable to the presence or absence of translatable mRNA. It is concluded that the synthesis of a majority of the proteins during spore germination is transcriptionally controlled."
"6602802","articletitle","Regulation of ferritin mRNA: a possible gene-sparing phenomenon. Induction of ferritin synthesis by iron in liver as well as red cells combines high translational efficiency with increased utilization of preformed ferritin mRNA."
"6602802","abstracttext","Control of ferritin synthesis by iron at the level of transcription is potentially hazardous to DNA because of the iron-catalyzed degradation of DNA. The induction of ferritin synthesis in reticulocytes of embryos (bullfrog tadpoles) occurs by two types of translational control i.e. increased availability of stored ferritin mRNA, in response to iron, coupled with a high translational efficiency. Since erythroid cell nuclei have large amounts of heterochromatin and may be relatively inactive genetically, the translational control of ferritin by iron observed in red cells was studied in other tissue by isolating poly (A+) RNA from tadpole liver and analyzing protein synthesis in vitro. Liver ferritin mRNA directed the synthesis of 7.0% of the protein in a wheat germ system, compared to 1.2% in vivo, suggesting that tadpole liver contained a large amount of stored ferritin mRNA. At levels of poly (A+) RNA which were saturating for total protein synthesis, ferritin synthesis was still linearly dependent upon RNA concentration, indicating a high efficiency of translation of ferritin mRNA. The results are analogous to those previously observed in red cells and confirm the storage of ferritin mRNA deduced from studies of the polysomal and nonpolysomal distribution of the mRNA in rat liver. The results indicate that the increased availability for translation of stored ferritin mRNA, in response to iron, and the high translational efficiency of ferritin mRNA are a general characteristic of ferritin synthesis rather than a specific feature of red cell maturation. This novel form of regulation of ferritin gene expression can be attributed to a need to protect DNA from degradation by iron and oxygen. The normal barrier between DNA and iron is apparently breached by the iron-oxygen complex of the drug bleomycin, an antitumor agent thought to act in vivo by iron-catalyzed cleavage of DNA."
"6309826","articletitle","Characterization of the insulin receptor kinase purified from human placental membranes."
"6309826","abstracttext","The insulin receptor purified from human placenta by sequential affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin- and insulin-Sepharose to near homogeneity retained tyrosine-specific protein kinase activity. This purified insulin receptor kinase specifically catalyzed the incorporation of 32P from [gamma-32P]ATP into not only the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor but also histone H2B, a synthetic peptide which is sequentially similar to the site of tyrosine phosphorylation in pp60src (a gene product of the Rous sarcoma virus) and antibodies to pp60src present in the sera obtained from three rabbits bearing tumors induced by the Rous sarcoma virus. In each case, phosphorylation occurred exclusively on tyrosine residues. Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of these substrates 3- to 5-fold. Kinetic analysis using the synthetic peptide indicated that insulin acted by increasing the Vmax of peptide phosphorylation from about 3.1 to 9.5 nmol X mg-1 of protein X min-1, whereas the value of the Km for the peptide, about 1.5 mM, was not significantly changed. This kinase acted weakly on casein, alpha-S-casein, actin, and a tyrosine-containing peptide analogue of a serine-containing peptide used commonly as a substrate for the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinases. These data show that the insulin receptor kinase displays specificity toward exogenous substrates similar to the substrate specificity observed for pp60src and the protein kinase activity associated with the receptor for epidermal growth factor. The data suggest that the catalytic sites of these three tyrosine kinases are similar and that insulin activates its receptor kinase by increasing the Vmax."
"6510413","articletitle","Effects of glucagon, dexamethasone and triiodothyronine on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP) synthesis and mRNA level in rat liver cells."
"6510413","abstracttext","Acute hormonal effects on the synthesis rate of the cytosolic form of the gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (GTP), were investigated using rat hepatocytes maintained in short-term suspension culture. Cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]leucine or [35S]methionine and the rate of synthesis of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase was estimated after immunoprecipitation of cell extracts with specific antibodies or following high-resolution two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of cell proteins. Total RNA was also extracted from cultured cells and subsequently translated in a wheat germ cell-free protein-synthesis system, in order to quantify the level of functional mRNA coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Glucagon, the single most effective inducer, causes a 15--20-fold increase in the level of specific mRNA in 2 h, accompanied by a similar increase in enzyme synthesis rate. The extent of induction is further amplified about threefold when dexamethasone is added to the culture medium. The synergistic action of dexamethasone does not require pre-exposure of the cells to the glucocorticoid, but on the contrary occurs without lag upon simultaneous addition of glucagon and dexamethasone. The induction of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA by glucagon is markedly depressed in hepatocytes inhibited for protein synthesis by cycloheximide. Cycloheximide-inhibited cells, however, display a considerable induction of the message after joint stimulation with dexamethasone and glucagon. Thus, the synergistic action of dexamethasone does not require concomitant protein synthesis. These data provide indirect evidence for a primary effect of the glucocorticoids on the expression of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene. Besides glucagon and dexamethasone, the thyroid hormones are shown to influence the rate of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase synthesis in isolated liver cells. The stimulatory effect of 3,5,3'-triiodothyronine (T3) is best demonstrated as a twofold increase in relative rate of enzyme synthesis in cells supplied with T3 plus glucagon, as compared to cells challenged with glucagon alone. The effect of T3 relies on a pretranslational mechanism, as shown by a commensurate increase in functional mRNA coding for phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Dose-response experiments with T3 as well as dexamethasone demonstrate effects at very low hormone levels, consistent with a role for these hormones as physiological modulators of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression."
"7439186","articletitle","The Xenopus oocyte as a surrogate secretory system. The specificity of protein export."
"7439186","abstracttext","Combining messenger RNA from one kind of secretory cell with the cytoplasm of another such cell can reveal the nature and specificity of protein export mechanisms. We show that messenger RNAs from secretory cells of chickens, rats, mice, frogs, guinea-pigs, locusts and barley plants, when injected into Xenopus oocytes, direct the synthesis and export of proteins. Chicken ovalbumin, Xenopus albumin, mouse thyroid-stimulating hormone, locust vitellin and guinea-pig milk proteins were identified using specific antibodies, whilst chicken lysozyme and ovomucoid, rat albumin, Xenopus vitellogenin and rat seminal vesicle basic proteins were identified provisionally from their molecular weights. Certain endogenous proteins are sequestered and secreted although most oocyte proteins are not exported. Similarly the major polyoma viral protein and the simian virus 40 and polyoma tumour antigens are retained within the oocyte. Radioactive proteins exported by oocytes programmed with chicken oviduct or Xenopus liver RNA are not re-exported in detectable amounts when injected into fresh oocytes, nor is there secretion of chicken oviduct or guinea-pig mammary gland primary translation products prepared using wheat germ extracts. Thus the export of secretory proteins from oocytes cannot be explained by leakage and may require a cotranslational event. The secretory system of the oocyte is neither cell-type nor species-specific yet is highly selective. We suggest that the oocyte can be used as a general surrogate system for the study of gene expression, from transcription through translation to the final subcellular or extracellular destination of the processed protein."
"8263133","articletitle","Expression of insulin receptor spliced variants and their functional correlates in muscle from patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus."
"8263133","abstracttext","Due to alternative splicing of exon 11 of the receptor gene, the human insulin receptor exists in two forms, that have distinct tissue-specific expression and are functionally different. Needle biopsies obtained from vastus lateralis muscle from 20 patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and 20 normal control subjects were analyzed for the relative expression of insulin receptor mRNA variants in a novel assay using fluorescence-labeled primers and subsequent analysis on an automated DNA sequencer. In subgroups of patients and control subjects, insulin binding and tyrosine kinase activity were examined in wheat germ agglutinin-purified insulin receptors isolated from muscle biopsies. Moreover, insulin-stimulated glucose disposal was studied by means of the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. No difference in the relative expression of spliced variants of the insulin receptor mRNA was observed (control subjects, 71.4 +/- 1.3% insulin receptor mRNA with exon 11; NIDDM patients, 71.5 +/- 1.3% insulin receptor mRNA with exon 11). No significant interrelationships were demonstrated among the relative expression of insulin receptor mRNA variants, insulin binding, and tyrosine kinase activity toward the exogenous substrate poly(Glu-Tyr(4:1)). Furthermore, no significant relationship was demonstrated between the glucose disposal rate and the relative expression of insulin receptor splice variants. In conclusion, in skeletal muscle from both normal control subjects and NIDDM patients, the proportion of insulin receptor mRNA with exon 11 is about 70%. In addition, no significant correlations exist among insulin binding, insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity, glucose disposal rate, and expression of alternative spliced insulin receptors in human skeletal muscle."
"8317092","articletitle","Complete nucleotide sequence and organization of the bipartite RNA genome of soil-borne wheat mosaic virus."
"8317092","abstracttext","The complete nucleotide sequences of RNAs 1 and 2 of soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV), type member of the furovirus group, were determined. RNA 1 is 7099 nucleotides (nt) and encodes a 150-kDa protein from the 5' end region, the UGA termination codon of which can be partially read through to produce a 209-kDa protein, and a 37-kDa protein in the 3' end region. The C-terminal region of the 150-kDa protein contains an NTP-binding helicase motif and the readthrough region, an RNA polymerase motif, indicating that these two overlapping proteins may form an RNA replication complex similar to those of tobamo- and tobraviruses. The 37-kDa protein has sequence similarity with the cell-to-cell transport protein of dianthoviruses. RNA 2 is 3593 nt and, from the 5' end region, encodes the 19-kDa capsid protein, whose UGA termination codon can be partially suppressed to produce an 84-kDa readthrough protein and, at the 3' proximity, a 19-kDa protein which is rich in cysteine residues. The 28K (kilodaltons, as estimated by SDS-PAGE) protein, previously considered as another capsid readthrough product, is apparently initiated at an in-frame non-AUG codon upstream from the capsid protein gene. In both RNAs 1 and 2, the 5' terminus is capped, and the 3' untranslated region possibly forms internal consecutive pseudoknots as found in tobamovirus RNA as well as a terminal tRNA-like structure similar to tymovirus RNA. An amino acid sequence comparison of RNA replicase genes indicates that, phylogenetically, SBWMV belongs to a cluster formed by tobamo-, tobra-, and hordeiviruses.

"8286857","abstracttext","The mechanisms of cytotoxic activity of Griffonia simplicifolia 1-B4 (GS1B4) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectins against various murine tumour cell lines were studied. Tumour cells that lack lectin-binding carbohydrates were resistant to lysis by these lectins. However, YAC-1 cells that expressed GS1B4 lectin-binding sites showed low sensitivity to lysis. To further analyse the relative importance of cell surface carbohydrates in lectin cytotoxicity, BL6-8 melanoma cells, which do not express the alpha 1,3 galactosyltransferase (alpha 1,3GT) gene and cell surface alpha-galactosyl epitopes reacting with GS1B4 lectin, were transfected with cDNA encoding alpha 1,3GT. After transfection, BL6-8 cells expressed high levels of GS1B4-binding alpha-galactosyl epitopes, but remained resistant to lysis by GS1B4 lectin, suggesting that the presence of lectin-binding epitopes, while essential, is not sufficient for tumour cell lysis and probably some intracellular mechanisms are involved in the regulation of lectin-mediated cytotoxicity. We found that the GS1B4 and WGA lectins induced apoptosis with DNA fragmentation of sensitive, but not resistant, tumour cell lines. DNA fragmentation, as well as tumour cell lysis, was blocked in the presence of the specific inhibitory sugar. To determine whether binding of the lectin to cell surface carbohydrates is sufficient to trigger tumour cell lysis, lectin-sensitive CL8-1 melanoma cells were incubated with GS1B4 lectin immobilized on agarose beads. Although these tumour cells bind to the immobilized lectin, it failed to trigger tumour cell death, suggesting that only soluble lectin is capable of tumour cell lysis and lectin internalization is probably required for their lysis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"8174649","articletitle","Synthesis of rabbit corneal epithelial glycocalyx in vitro."
"8174649","abstracttext","A method to study the synthesis and cellular processing of epithelial apical membrane glycoproteins in the rabbit cornea was developed. Fluorescent derivatives of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; alpha-N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid hapten affinities), succinylated WGA (alpha-N-acetylglucosamine hapten affinity) and concavalin A (Con A; D-mannose and D-glucose hapten affinity) were reacted with the corneal surface and the extent of binding attained was measured by en face, microscope-aided fluorophotometry. Minimal binding of succinylated WGA and a large reduction in WGA binding following neuraminidase treatment demonstrated that the attachment of WGA to the corneal surface occurred via sialic acid residues, i.e. via structures associated with terminal glycosylation. Corneas were treated with digitonin to induce the exfoliation of the outer squamous-like cell layers. The time-dependent changes in lectin binding density at the apical surface of the newly exposed intrastratal cells were then determined. Binding densities for WGA and Con A at the time of exfoliation of the digitonin-devitalized squamous cell layers (< 2 hr post-devitalization) were similar to the densities measured at the surface of untreated corneas. Over the subsequent 18-20 hr, the WGA and Con A binding increased by 2.63 +/- 0.24 and 3.0 +/- 0.68 (+/- S.D., n = 4) fold, respectively. The effect of inhibitors of transcription (actinomycin D, alpha-amanitin), translation (cycloheximide), core glycosylation of polypeptides (tunicamycin), endoplasmic reticulum glucosidases (deoxinojirimycin) and Golgi mannosidase (swainsonine) indicated that the increases were underpinned by new glycoprotein synthesis driven by a stable, pre-existing mRNA pool. Retinoic acid (2 microM) inhibited the increase in WGA binding by 55 +/- 6% (n = 4) but did not affect the Con A density increase suggesting that this agent either, modifies the terminal glycosylation pattern of apical membrane proteins and/or inhibits the synthesis of proteins bearing sialic acid. Actinomycin D or alpha-aminitin reverted the retinoic acid action, indicating that the retinoid effect is mediated by induced gene expression."
"8146124","articletitle","Homologous modeling of the lysosomal protective protein/carboxypeptidase L: structural and functional implications of mutations identified in galactosialidosis patients."
"8146124","abstracttext","The deficiency of the lysosomal protective protein/carboxypeptidase L (CARB L) causes the lysosomal storage disorder, galactosialidosis, characterized by neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase deficiencies in patients' cells. The three enzymes form a complex inside the lysosome, and the neuraminidase and beta-galactosidase deficiencies are secondary to CARB L deficiency. Sequence similarity and common enzymological properties suggest that the protomeric tertiary structure of CARB L is conserved within a family of serine carboxypeptidases which includes the yeast carboxypeptidase Y, killer expression I gene product and several plant carboxypeptidases. We used this homology to build a model of the CARB L structure based on the recently published X-ray atomic coordinates of the wheat carboxypeptidase II (CPDW-II) which shares 32% primary structure identity with CARB L. Small insertions and deletions were accommodated into the model structure by energy minimization using the DREIDING II force field. The C alpha atomic coordinates of the final CARB L model have a RMS shift of 1.01 A compared to the corresponding conserved residues in the CPDW-II template structure. The correct orientation of the homologous catalytic triad residues Ser150, His429 and Asp392, the potential energy calculations and the distribution of hydrophobic and hydrophillic residues in the structure all support the validity of the CARB L model. Most missense mutations identified in galactosialidosis patients were located in secondary structural elements except for the Tyr211-->Asn mutation which is in a loop. The other mutant residues have their side chains deeply buried in the central beta-sheet of the model structure except for the Phe412-->Val mutation which is located in the dimer interface. The predicted effects of specific mutations on CARB L structural stability correlates well with recently published transient expression studies of mutant CARB L (Shimmoto, M. et al., J. Clin. Invest., 91:2393-2399, 1993)."
"8148649","articletitle","PF1: an A-T hook-containing DNA binding protein from rice that interacts with a functionally defined d(AT)-rich element in the oat phytochrome A3 gene promoter."
"8148649","abstracttext","Phytochrome-imposed down-regulation of the expression of its own phytochrome A gene (PHYA) is one of the fastest light-induced effects on transcription reported in plants to date. Functional analysis of the oat PHYA3 promoter in a transfection assay has revealed two positive elements, PE1 and PE3, that function synergistically to support high levels of transcription in the absence of light. We have isolated a rice cDNA clone (pR4) encoding a DNA binding protein that binds to the AT-rich PE1 element. We tested the selectivity of the pR4-encoded DNA binding activity using linker substitution mutations of PE1 that are known to disrupt positive expression supported by the PHYA3 promoter in vivo. Binding to these linker substitution mutants was one to two orders of magnitude less than to the native PE1 element. Because this is the behavior expected of positive factor 1 (PF1), the presumptive nuclear transcription factor that acts in trans at the PE1 element in vivo, the data support the conclusion that the protein encoded by pR4 is in fact rice PF1. The PF1 polypeptide encoded by pR4 is 213 amino acids long and contains four repeats of the A-T hook DNA binding motif found in high-mobility group I-Y (HMGI-Y) proteins. In addition, PF1 contains an 11-amino acid-long hydrophobic region characteristic of HMG I proteins, its N-terminal region shows strong similarities to a pea H1 histone sequence and a short peptide sequence from wheat HMGa, and it shows a high degree of similarity along its entire length to the HMG Y-like protein encoded by a soybean cDNA, SB16. In vitro footprinting and quantitative gel shift analyses showed that PF1 binds preferentially to the PE1 element but also at lower affinity to two other AT-rich regions upstream of PE1. This feature is consistent with the binding characteristics of HMG I-Y proteins that are known to bind to most runs of six or more AT base pairs. Taken together, the properties of PF1 suggest that it belongs to a newly described family of nuclear proteins containing both histone H1 domains and A-T hook DNA binding domains."
"8148876","articletitle","Pokeweed antiviral protein inactivates pokeweed ribosomes; implications for the antiviral mechanism."
"8148876","abstracttext","Pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP) and other ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) had previously been thought to be incapable of attacking conspecific ribosomes, thus having no effect on endogenous processes. This assertion conflicts with a model for PAP's in vivo antiviral mechanism in which PAP (a cell wall protein) selectively enters virus-infected cells and disrupts protein synthesis, thus causing local suicide and preventing virus replication. We show here that pokeweed (Phytolacca americana) ribosomes, as well as endod (Phytolacca dodecandra) ribosomes, are indeed highly sensitive to inactivation by conspecific RIPs. Ribosomes isolated from RIP-free pokeweed and endod suspension culture cells were found to be highly active in vitro, as measured by poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. Phytolacca ribosomes challenged with conspecific RIPs generated dose-response curves (IC50 of 1 nM PAP or dodecandrin) very similar to those from wheat germ ribosomes. To determine if Phytolacca cells produce a cytosolic 'anti-RIP' protective element, ribosomes were combined with Phytolacca postribosomal supernatant factors from culture cells, then challenged with conspecific RIPs. Resulting IC50 values of 3-7 nM PAP, PAP-II, PAP-S or dodecandrin indicate that supernatants from these Phytolacca cells lack a ribosomal protective element. This research demonstrates that PAP inactivates pokeweed ribosomes (and is therefore potentially toxic to pokeweed cells) and supports the local suicide model for PAP's in vivo antiviral mechanism. The importance of spatial separation between PAP and ribosomes of cells producing this RIP is emphasized, particularly if crop plants are transformed with the PAP gene to confer antiviral protection."

"8806176","abstracttext","Several species of alternatively spliced mRNAs are transcribed from the E6 gene region of human papillomavirus (HPV) 16. These have the coding capacity for either the full length E6 of 151 amino acids (aa) or four truncated variants, E6I-E6IV, of 43-64 aa. As the first step to identify the putative E6 variants and their functions, we generated cDNAs corresponding to the various E6 open reading frames (ORF) and examined their expression employing in vitro transcription/translation systems and the bacterial pET system. In wheat germ extract, in vitro translation resulted in the production of all five proteins, E6 and E6I-E6IV. These proteins were also expressed as stable fusion proteins from the pET16b and pET17 x b vectors in Escherichia coli. Mobilites of the E6 variant proteins on SDS-acrylamide gels were consistent with their predicted sizes. The authenticity of the synthesized proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with specific antibodies directed against epitopes in the N-terminal portion of E6 as well as antibodies raised against the individual variant proteins produced in E. coli. In rabbit reticulocyte lysate, however, only the full length E6 and the E6IV variant were synthesized. This could be due to inefficient translation as well as lower stability of the short variants. E6I-III, in reticulocyte lysate (RTL). The ability of the E6 variants to associate with p53 and target its proteolytic degradation in vitro, was examined in coimmunoprecipitation assays, using in vitro synthesized proteins and monoclonal antibodies to p53. Results of these assays indicated that only the full length E6 efficiently binds to and promotes the degradation of p53. The E6 variants E6I-E6IV, although able to associate with p53 at a low efficiency, were unable to target its degradation."

"9061450","abstracttext","Wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (WGA-HRP) was injected into the dorsal root ganglia (L5-S1) of the cat and used as an anterograde tracer substance for intra-axonal labelling of peripheral nerve endings in joint capsule and cranial (anterior) cruciate ligament (CCL). We believed that the high specificity of WGA-HRP for neural tissue along with the high visibility of its reaction product could help resolve controversies concerning the sensory innervation of the cruciate ligaments. Substantial amounts of WGA-HRP were transported in tibial nerve axons to the level of the knee. However, using standard HRP histochemistry we found that the capsular tissue and ligament synovia disintegrated during the incubation reaction. This problem was avoided by air drying the tissue slices on glass slides prior to reaction. Abundant labelling occurred in the posterior capsule with dense filling of axons and terminal endings. Sensory endings displayed features consistent with Ruffini endings and pacinian corpuscles. Sensory endings were located throughout the CCL in its sagittal plane, in the subsynovial layers and between collagen fascicles. In each CCL we observed 5-17 ovoid and elongated endings with dense terminal arborisations. These endings were between 100 and 150 microns long, were encapsulated, and gave rise to 1 or 2 axons. Large (up to 1.5 mm in maximum extent) elongated regions of dense, inhomogeneous labelling were found in the body of several CCLs. These resembled Golgi tendon-like endings, with the exception of their large size. We conclude that anterograde transport of HRP to the knee is a useful technique for labelling mechanoreceptors and axons in knee tissue. However, recently developed immunohistochemical analysis of peripheral tissue using protein gene product 9.5 appears to be the method of choice and should be employed for further study of human and animal cruciate ligament innervation."

"9141615","abstracttext","Thermotolerance and heat resistance are often associated with elevated levels of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and a selective increase in protein glycosylation. In the present study, we have characterized heat stress-induced protein glycosylation in M21 cells, derived from the rat fibroblast line, Rat-1. M21 cells are characterized by constitutive overexpression of human HSP70 gene and show increased heat resistance without loss of its normal capacity for thermotolerance development after heat conditioning (Li et al., 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88, 1681-1685). The data presented here show that the elevated heat resistance in these cells is associated not only with the constitutive overexpression of human HSP70, but also with increased glycosylation of a major stress glycoprotein, GP62 (Mr of 62,000). We further purified GP62 by sequential preparative isoelectric focusing and two-dimensional isoelectric focusing/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The purified protein was digested and partially characterized by microsequencing of two peptide fragments, comprising of 14-15 amino acids each. These fragments had a 100% sequence homology with HSP70 and a 71-100% sequence homology with HSC70 from various species. Western blotting using both HSP70 and HSC70 antibodies showed positive reactivity of GP62 with HSP70. Affinity characterizations showed strong binding of GP62 to wheat germ agglutinin and concanavalin A, consistent with the presence of both alpha-D-mannosyl/glucosyl and N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosylaminyl/glucosamine oligomer residues in GP62. These data confirm the glycosylated status of GP62 and indicate that GP62 is a heat stress-induced glycoprotein with partial homology to HSP70."
"9076989","articletitle","The ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) gene family in Arabidopsis thaliana."
"9076989","abstracttext","Conjugation of multiple ubiquitins serves as a committed step in the degradation of a variety of intracellular eukaryotic proteins by the 26S proteasome. Conjugates are formed via a three-enzyme cascade; the initial step requires ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), which couples ubiquitin activation to ATP hydrolysis. Previously, we showed that many higher plants contain multiple E1 proteins and described several E1 genes from wheat. To facilitate understanding of the roles of the different plant E1s, we characterized the E1 gene and protein family from Arabidopsis thaliana. Arabidopsis E1s are encoded by two genes (AtUBA1 and AtUBA2) that synthesize approximately 123-kDa proteins with 81% amino acid sequence identity to each other and 44-75% sequence identity with confirmed E1s from other organisms. Like other E1 proteins, AtUBA1 and 2 contain a cysteine residue in the putative active site for forming the ubiquitin thiol-ester intermediate. Enzymatic analysis of the corresponding proteins expressed in Escherichia coli demonstrated that both proteins activate ubiquitin in an ATP-dependent reaction and transfer the activated ubiquitin to a variety of Arabidopsis E2s with near equal specificity. Expression studies by quantitative RT-PCR and histochemistry with transgenic plants containing AtUBA promoter-beta-glucuronidase-coding region fusions showed that the AtUBA1 and 2 genes are co-expressed in most, if not all, Arabidopsis tissues and cells. Collectively, the data indicate that E1 proteins, and presumably the rest of the ubiquitin pathway, are present throughout Arabidopsis. They also show that the AtUBA1 and 2 genes are not differentially expressed nor do they encode E1s with dramatically distinct enzymatic properties."
"8381507","articletitle","Solubilization and characterization of a guanine nucleotide-sensitive form of the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor."
"8381507","abstracttext","Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptors were solubilized from rat cerebellum membranes in an active, stable, and guanine nucleotide-sensitive form by using digitonin. Nearly 90% of membrane CGRP receptors and 50% of membrane protein were solubilized by digitonin treatment of cerebellum membranes. Binding of 125ICGRP to soluble receptors was specific, saturable, of high affinity, and reversible. Scatchard analysis of the saturation binding data revealed a homogeneous population of binding sites with a Kd of 178 +/- 42 pM and a Bmax of 201 +/- 17 fmol/mg of protein. Binding of 125ICGRP to soluble receptors was inhibited nearly 60% by guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) (100 microM), suggesting coupling of receptors with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) to form high affinity binding sites. Antiserum against the amino-terminal region of Gs alpha immunoprecipitated a significant portion of soluble CGRP receptors, indicating association of receptors with Gs alpha. In agreement with the saturation binding data, association kinetic studies with soluble receptors indicated binding of 125ICGRP to a single population of sites. Dissociation kinetic data, in contrast, demonstrated that 125ICGRP dissociated from labeled receptors with fast- and slow-dissociating components. GTP gamma S significantly accelerated dissociation of 125ICGRP from labeled receptors; however, dissociation still occurred from two distinct affinity components, with rate constants significantly different from those observed in the absence of GTP gamma S. These observations suggest that soluble CGRP receptors, like native membrane-bound receptors, exist in two distinct affinity states in both G protein-coupled and -uncoupled receptor states. Soluble receptors were retained specifically on a wheat germ lectin column, and affinity cross-linking of receptors specifically labeled with 125ICGRP demonstrated labeling of a 67-kDa protein, suggesting that the rat cerebellum CGRP receptor is a 67-kDa glycoprotein. This study is the first to report solubilization of CGRP receptors retaining the native ability of the receptor to undergo functional coupling with G proteins and to provide direct evidence for association of these receptors with Gs alpha."

"8106417","abstracttext","Retroviral insertional mutagenesis can both generate somatic cell mutants and pinpoint the genomic locus associated with a mutant phenotype. In the present study, this approach was applied to Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) made susceptible to Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMuLV) infection by stable expression of an ecotropic retrovirus receptor. These CHO cells were infected with a replication incompetent MoMuLV construct with a promoterless hygromycin phosphotransferase (hygro) gene inserted into the U3 region of the long terminal repeat and a second selectable marker, neomycin phosphotransferase (neo), expressed from an internal promoter. CHO clones containing integrated proviruses were selected with hygromycin or G418, and the subset of these with reduced cell surface Neu5Ac were then selected with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). The majority of the resulting clones had a phenotype not previously described for WGA-resistant CHO mutants arising spontaneously or from chemical mutagenesis: Neu5Ac was almost completely replaced by Neu5Gc. We have provisionally termed these clones SAP mutants, for sialic acid phenotype. Southern analysis of HindIII digested DNA from four SAP mutants revealed that the MoMuLV provirus is present in a 10.4-kilobase (kb) fragment. Probing with a flanking CHO sequence resulted in equivalent hybridization to a 4.6-kb fragment and the 10.4-kb provirus-containing fragment in all four cases, while uninfected parental cells and non-SAP glycosylation mutants generated in the same retrovirus insertional mutagenesis experiments yielded only the 4.6-kb fragment. Sequencing of the 3'-flanking DNA revealed that each of the four SAP mutants had a unique provirus integration site falling within a 796 bp region of the CHO genome. The frequency with which SAP mutants arise suggests that this may be a preferred site for retrovirus integration."

"8403797","abstracttext","1. We hypothesized that differences within genes whose protein products are involved in apolipoprotein B metabolism could influence the response of plasma apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein concentrations to increases in dietary fibre. 2. We studied 67 subjects (43 men and 24 women) who had taken part in parallel 2 week metabolic dietary studies involving either wheat bran or oat bran supplementation. Fasting blood lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations were measured at the start and end of the 2 week metabolic period. Genotypes were determined using DNA markers for the low-density lipoprotein receptor, apolipoprotein B, apolipoprotein CIII and hepatic lipase gene loci. 3. Reductions in plasma concentrations of apolipoprotein B were significantly different depending on genotype determined with a low-density lipoprotein receptor DNA marker (P = 0.03). There was no significant variation in the reduction of plasma total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or apolipoprotein B concentrations for alleles of other genes tested. 4. Thus, genetic variability is associated with interindividual differences in the fibre-related reduction in plasma apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein B-containing lipoprotein concentrations. Implementation of current dietary recommendations to reduce plasma lipoprotein levels with fibre may have variable effects in different individuals in part because of structural differences in candidate genes whose products are involved in lipoprotein metabolism."

"8371976","abstracttext","Efficient transfer of exogenous proteins into culture animal cells can be achieved by Streptolysin O (SLO) permeabilization of plasma membranes. We used this method to establish an in vitro transcription system for early response genes. The promoters of many early response genes contain an essential DNA motif known as the Serum Response Element (SRE). Recent data has shown that this DNA sequence is recognized by Serum Response Factor (SRF) and its associated proteins. Our initial experiments showed that HeLa nuclear extracts induced the transcription of the c-fos gene in serum-starved murine fibroblasts which were permeabilized by either physical method (glass beads) or cytolytic pore-forming protein (SLO). Plasma membrane permeabilization presumably permits passive diffusion of macromolecules into target cells and we showed that a truncated SRF expressed in bacteria was translocated into the nucleus within 30 minutes after SLO permeabilization. HeLa crude extracts were fractionated in order to identify the active nuclear factors. SRF was purified by binding to Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA)-agarose but the active factors remained in the WGA-unbound fractions. Our results demonstrate that this permeabilized cell in vitro transcription system is simple, efficient and can be used to test crude nuclear fractions as well as purified proteins expressed in bacteria; it will be an useful tool for the reproduction of transcriptional regulation on chromatin templates in vitro as well as the investigation of the biochemical functions of specific transcription factors or signal transduction effectors."

To isolate further copies of the reiterated xynB/C 5' region, a genomic library of Ps. fluorescens subsp. cellulosa DNA was screened with a probe constructed from the conserved region of xynB. DNA from one phage which hybridized to the probe, but not to sequences upstream or downstream of the reiterated xynB/C locus, was subcloned into pMTL22p to construct pFG1. The recombinant plasmid expressed a protein in Escherichia coli, designated esterase XYLD, of M(r) 58,500 which bound to cellulose but not to xylan. XYLD hydrolysed aryl esters, released acetate groups from acetylxylan and liberated 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid from destarched wheat bran. The nucleotide sequence of the XYLD-encoding gene, xynD, revealed an open reading frame of 1752 bp which directed the synthesis of a protein of M(r) 60,589. The 5' 817 bp of xynD and the amino acid sequence between residues 37 and 311 of XYLD were almost identical with the corresponding regions of xynB and xynC and their encoded proteins XYLB and XYLC. Truncated derivatives of XYLD lacking the N-terminal conserved sequence retained the capacity to hydrolyse ester linkages, but did not bind cellulose. Expression of truncated derivatives of xynD, comprising the 5' 817 bp sequence, encoded a non-catalytic polypeptide that bound cellulose. These data indicate that XYLD has a modular structure comprising of a N-terminal cellulose-binding domain and a C-terminal catalytic domain."

"8617263","abstracttext","Recent advances in melanogenesis have focused on the role of dihydroxyindole-2-carboxylic acid[(HO)2IndCOOH]. For example, it has been shown that formation of (HO)2IndCOOH from dopachrome is catalyzed by dopachrome tautomerase, that the melanogenic protein tyrosinase-related protein (TRP)-1 can oxidize (HO)2IndCOOH to its indole quinone, that (HO)2IndCOOH-melanins can be synthesized chemically, that mammalian melanins are naturally rich in (HO)2IndCOOH subunits, and that (HO)2IndCOOH is incorporated into melanins of melanomas in mice. The question thus emerges as to the mechanism(s) by which (HO)2IndCOOH and other precursors become incorporated into melanins in vivo. Accordingly, an activity was partially purified that catalyzed melanin formation with (HO)2IndCOOH as a substrate. Analyses of the (HO)2IndCOOH polymerization factor from Cloudman melanoma cells revealed the following: it was proteinaceous in that it was heat labile and destroyed by proteinase K; it was a glycoprotein in that it adhered to wheat germ agglutinin and was eluted with N-acetyl glucosamine; it was located predominantly in the melanosomal fraction of cell homogenates; the activity was reduced by exposure to the metal chelators EDTA and EGTA, but not by phenylthiourea, a tyrosinase inhibitor; the (HO)2IndCOOH polymerization reaction was inhibited by superoxide dismutase. In addition, the activity was found with the mouse pmel 17/silver locus protein immunopurified from human melanoma cells, and was significantly reduced in extracts of mouse melanocytes cultured from silver (si/si) mice compared to extracts from Si/Si melanocytes. In summary, an activity has been identified in human and mouse melanoma cells that catalyzes the superoxide-dependent polymerization of (HO)2IndCOOH to melanin in vitro, and appears to be a function of the pmel 17/silver protein of the human pmel 17 gene and the mouse silver locus."

"9274012","abstracttext","Gibberella zeae is a pathogen of small grain crops and produces trichothecene mycotoxins in infected host tissue. The role of trichothecenes in the virulence of G. zeae was previously investigated using trichothecene-non-producing mutants that were generated via transformation-mediated disruption of a gene (Tri5) that encodes the first enzyme in the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway. The mutants were less virulent on some hosts than the wild-type strain from which they were derived. Here, we used two approaches to determine whether the reduced virulence of mutants was due specifically to Tri5 disruption or to non-target effects caused by the transformation process. First, we generated a revertant from a Tri5 disruption mutant by allowing the mutant to pass through the sexual phase of its life cycle. In approximately 2% of the resulting progeny the disrupted Tri5 had reverted to wild-type; however, only one of three revertant progeny also regained the ability to produce trichothecenes. In the second approach, we complemented the Tri5 mutation in a disruption mutant by transforming the mutant with a plasmid carrying a functional copy of Tri5. In all transformants examined, the ability to produce trichothecenes was restored. The restoration of trichothecene production in the revertant progeny and in the complemented mutant was accompanied by restoration of wild-type or near wild-type levels of virulence on wheat seedlings (cultivar Wheaton). The results indicate that the reduced virulence of the mutants was caused by disruption of Tri5 rather than non-target effects resulting from the transformation process. The results also provide further evidence that trichothecenes contribute to the virulence of plant-pathogenic fungi."
"9267431","articletitle","Differential expression of two functional serine/threonine protein kinases from soybean that have an unusual acidic domain at the carboxy terminus."
"9267431","abstracttext","Two soybean cDNA clones, SPK-3 and SPK-4, encoding putative protein kinases were isolated and characterized. Both cDNAs encoded approximately 40-kDa serine/threonine kinases with unusual stretches of acidic amino acids in their carboxy-terminal regions, which are highly homologous to PKABA1 from wheat and ASKs from Arabidopsis. These kinases are encoded by one- or two-copy genes in the soybean genome. Notably, SPK-3 and -4 showed different patterns of expression in various soybean tissues. SPK-3 is highly expressed in dividing and elongating tissues of young seedlings but relatively weakly in tissues of mature plants. In contrast, SPK-4 showed relatively high and constitutive expression in all the tissues examined except for leaf tissues of mature plants. Although various stressors, such as dehydration and high salinity, increased the expression of both genes, the induction kinetics were different. The two genes also differed in their response to abscisic acid (ABA). SPK-3 was induced but SPK-4 was not affected by exogenously supplied abscisic acid. In accordance with these expression data analysis of the activity of a chimeric SPK-3 promoter::beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene by transient expression in tobacco leaves confirmed the inducibility of SPK-3 by salt and ABA. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a recombinant SPK-4 protein produced in Escherichia coli specifically recognized both recombinant SPK-3 and -4 proteins. Kinase assays using affinity-purified SPK-4/ antibody complexes with crude soybean extracts as substrate identified specific phosphorylation of two 41 and 170 kDa soybean proteins that were phosphorylated on serine residues. Taken together, our results suggest that SPK-3, and/or SPK-4 are functional serine protein kinase(s). Furthermore, SPK-3 and -4 may play different roles in the transduction of various environmental stresses."

Tetrahymena tRNATyr genes are efficiently transcribed in HeLa cell nuclear extract. Moreover, processing and splicing occurred in HeLa as well as in wheat germ extracts, supporting the notion that Tetrahymena tRNATyr introns can be classified as authentic tRNA introns. We have also isolated cytoplasmic tRNATyr from Tetrahymena cells. This tRNATyr isoacceptor has a QPsiA anticodon and is not a UAG suppressor as shown in in vitro translation studies. Since UAG and UAA codons are used as glutamine codons in Tetrahymena macronuclear DNA, the presence of a strong natural UAG suppressor such as tRNATyr with GPsiA anticodon should cause misreading of the glutamine as tyrosine codons and the absence of the latter had thus been predicted. Furthermore we have studied the organization of tRNATyr genes in the genome of T.thermophila and have found two types of tRNATyr gene arrangement. A minimum of 12 tRNATyr genes are present as single copies in genomic DNA HindIII restriction fragments ranging in size from 0.6 to 7 kb. Additionally one cluster of tRNATyr genes consisting of six members has been detected in a 2.3 kb HindIII fragment."

"10094772","abstracttext","To facilitate RNA-binding studies of the phage RB69 RegA translational repressor protein, regA was configured to add six histidines to the carboxyl end of the protein. In vitro transcription-translation from the T7 promoter on plasmid pSA1 yielded a RegA69-His6 protein that binds nickel-Sepharose and elutes with 0.5 M imidazole. The system was further modified to avoid cloning and the toxic effects of RegA on Escherichia coli by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), producing linear templates with the configuration T7 promoter-TIR-regA-His6. A translation initiation region was used that conforms to consensus E. coli and eukaryotic initiation sites and eliminates the target for RegA autogenous repression. RegA69-His6 synthesized in E. coli S30 or wheat germ extracts displayed RNA-binding properties similar to wild-type RB69 RegA. Specificity of RNA binding was demonstrated by in vitro repression of T4 gp44 and gp45 but not beta-lactamase, by differential binding to poly(U)- and poly(C)-agarose, and by site-specific binding to a 23-base gene 44 target RNA but not to mutant 44 RNA. Therefore, addition of the His6 tag to the C-terminus of RB69 RegA does not dramatically alter RNA binding, indicating that this region is not directly involved in site recognition. With access to several T4-like phage genomes and regA mutant sequences, in vitro synthesis of His-tagged proteins directly from linear PCR products provides a convenient and efficient system to study RegA and other interesting RNA-binding proteins."
"9839536","articletitle","Detection of the membrane-retained carboxy-terminal tail containing polypeptides of the amyloid precursor protein in tissue from Alzheimer's disease brain."
"9839536","abstracttext","A major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques consisting primarily of amyloid beta peptide (A beta) which is derived from a larger beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). APP is processed via secretory and endosomal/lysosomal pathways by a group of proteases called secretases. During the processing of APP, the carboxy-terminal tail fragment has been suggested to remain within the cell. To investigate the fate of this fragment, we generated an antibody specific for a nine amino acid residue, the sequence of which was derived from the carboxy-terminal putative cytoplasmic tail of APP. Computer analysis of the entire APP gene, searching for regions of greatest antigenicity, surface probability, hydrophilicity, and presence of beta turns, indicated that the cytoplasmic tail region is an immunodominant region of APP. The peptide coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin protein, produced a very high titer antibody (1:1 x 10(6)). To evaluate the specificity of the antibody, immunoprecipitation of in vitro transcribed and translated DNA encoding the carboxy-terminal amino acids of APP in wheat germ extract was carried out. A single immunoprecipitated band of the correct size was seen by SDS-PAGE. The antibody was also able to specifically detect the accumulation of the stable C-terminal tail containing fragments of APP in neurites of the amygdala and hippocampus regions of the human brain tissue from AD subjects, but did not react with age-matched control normal brain tissue. The localization of the C-terminal tail of APP within the brain tissue of AD patients underscores the likely importance of the C-terminus in the pathogenesis of AD."

"9796102","abstracttext","We recently reported that formation of allopolyploid wheat was accompanied by rapid nonrandom changes in low-copy noncoding DNA sequences. In this report we show that following allopolyploidization, changes also occurred in coding sequences. Genomic DNA of nine different newly synthesized amphiploids of different ploidy levels and their parental lines was digested with five restriction enzymes and probed with 43 coding sequences. The sequences, 19 genomic and 24 cDNA sequences, are group (homoelogous) specific and represent the proximal and distal regions of the short and long arms of the seven homoeologous groups of the Triticeae. We revealed three types of changes: disappearance of a parental hybridization fragment(s), appearance of a novel fragment(s), and simultaneous disappearance of a parental fragment(s) and appearance of a novel fragment(s). No elimination of sequences took place, since in every sequence studied the parental hybridization fragments were present in at least one of the enzyme digests. Variations in pattern among individual plants of the same amphiploid, as well as a between several synthetic and natural amphiploids, indicated that at least some of the genomic changes occurred at random. Intergenomic recombination was not the cause of the observed changes. Evidence was obtained, however, that changes were also brought about by DNA methylation. Methylation may cause inactivation of genes or modify their expression levels in some of the newly synthesized amphiploid plants, leading to genetic diploidization and gene-dosage compensation and thus increasing variation among individuals."
"9405736","articletitle","Purification and characterization of bone-specific alkaline phosphatase from a human osteosarcoma cell line."
"9405736","abstracttext","Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone ALP) levels are considered to reflect osteoblastic activity and can therefore be used as a marker of bone formation. However, bone ALP is difficult to distinguish from other ALP isoforms since the kidney, liver, and bone isoenzymes are encoded by the same gene and only differ because of post-translational modification of their carbohydrate side chains. The aim of this study was to purify and separate bone ALP which could be used to raise specific antisera against human bone ALP, from Saos-2, a human osteogenic sarcoma cell line. The procedure involved two steps. The first step, cultivation of 10(5) Saos-2 cells, yielded approximately 1 U ALP. Subsequent butanol extraction achieved 1.82-fold purification. For the second step, separating bone ALP, we used serial lectin affinity chromatography to distinguish between the carbohydrate side chains of the various ALP isoforms. A sample of the butanol extract was fractionated into three peaks (I, II, and III) by concanavalin A. Peaks II and III were subsequently identified as types IIa and IIIb bone ALP using pea lectin and wheat germ agglutinin columns, respectively. The specific activity of bone ALP was measured using commercial kits. Since bone ALP accounted for at least 84% of the total ALP activity after the final separation, this method appears more convenient and reproducible than others using bone or Pagetic sera. The bone ALP purified in this study could be used to raise monoclonal antibodies against bone-specific ALP."
"9513085","articletitle","High-level expression of biologically active recombinant bovine follicle stimulating hormone in a baculovirus system."
"9513085","abstracttext","Superovulation treatment of cows can benefit from the application of very pure recombinant bovine FSH (rbFSH), which is produced in nonmammalian cells. rbFSH is completely free of LH, and therefore can possibly reduce the variability in the results of superovulation. Furthermore, it does not contain brain-tissue-derived proteins and, when produced under serum-free conditions, it is free of other mammalian substances or potentially infectious material. We have produced rbFSH in insect cells, with the ultimate aim of inducing superovulation in cattle. Sf21 insect cells were coinfected with two recombinant baculoviruses, containing the cDNAs of bovine FSH alpha- and beta-subunits respectively. High levels of production of bioactive rbFSH were obtained after cloning cDNA that contained a major part of the 3' untranslated region of the bFSH beta gene. Maximum production of rbFSH 1-5 micrograms/ml (as measured by immunoassay) was obtained 70-90 h after infection. The recombinant material was highly potent in two in vitro bioassays, giving biological activities of 13 IU/ml (Y1 cell rounding assay), 22 IU/ml (Y1 cell cAMP assay), and 23 IU/ml (bovine oocyte maturation inhibition assay), and had a lower but significant activity of 6 IU/ml in the rat Sertoli cell assay. rbFSH was purified by immunoaffinity chromatography, using a monoclonal antibody directed against the human FSH beta-subunit. The purified heterodimer appeared to be homogeneous by SDS-PAGE, whereas the free beta-subunit appeared as a doublet, possibly indicating differently glycosylated forms. Intact heterodimer and both subunits were further identified by western blot analysis, and showed apparent molecular masses of 20 kDa (alpha-subunit), 23 kDa (beta-subunit) and 32.5 kDa (heterodimer). This insect-cell-produced rbFSH did not bind to wheat germ agglutinin, thus indicating that glycosidic side-chains may not contain terminal sialic acid. The relevance of a large 3' untranslated region in bFSH beta cDNA to the level of production of rbFSH, and the possible implications of the pattern of glycosylation for the biological activity of the recombinant hormone are discussed."

"9465780","abstracttext","Quantifying alkaline phosphatase (ALP) isoenzymes in canine serum would provide a useful index in a clinical laboratory. To achieve this goal, we tested a semi-automatic assay combining wheat germ lectin (WGL) precipitation and chemical inhibition of isoenzymes of the TNS gene with levamisole to quantify bone ALP (BALP) and corticosteroid-induced ALP (CALP), respectively. The liver ALP (LALP) isoenzyme was then calculated from the equation: TALP = BALP + LALP + CALP BALP, LALP and CALP standards from serum of puppies, bile-duct ligated dogs and dogs on 4.4 mg/kg/day prednisolone for 30 days, respectively, were used. The suitability of standard sera was tested by affinity electrophoresis. Levamisole (4.2 mM) inhibits 98% of BALP and LALP but only 42% CALP. Multiplying measured CALP by 1.8 gives the total CALP value in serum. WGL precipitated 92.3% BALP, 23.3% LALP and 26.8% heated CALP standards. These values were used to adjust precipitated ALP to obtain the exact levels of BALP. WGL was then tested on pooled serum standards in which the relative proportions of all the ALPs were known and controlled. BALP was adequately quantified except when LALP and CALP levels were extremely high. The assay was also applicable under conditions resulting in high ALP. Therefore, combining WGL and levamisole inhibition provides an adequate separation and quantification of canine ALP isoenzymes. The method has great potential for diagnostic use and should be tested further for routine implementation."

"9593637","abstracttext","The mammalian cornea receives a dense sensory innervation and a modest sympathetic innervation. The purpose of the current study was to determine if the rat cornea is also innervated by parasympathetic nerves. In the first set of experiments, unilateral combined sympathetic and sensory ocular denervations were performed in adult rats by surgical removal of the superior cervical ganglion and intracranial transection of the trigeminal ophthalmomaxillary nerve. Completeness of the denervation procedure was verified postmortem by a variety of macroscopic and immunohistochemical methods. Five to twelve days later, the corneas were serially sectioned tangential to the ocular surface and processed immunohistochemically with antibodies against the pan-neuronal markers, protein gene product 9.5 (PGP-9.5) and peripherin. In every animal a small, but constant, population of corneal and limbal immunoreactive fibers were unaffected by the surgical denervations and were concluded to derive from parasympathetic ganglia. In the second set of experiments, the origins of the rat corneal innervation were determined by applying the neuroanatomical tracer, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) to the central cornea. Two to four days later, the trigeminal, superior cervical, ciliary, accessory ciliary and pterygopalatine ganglia were sectioned and analysed for the presence of HRP-labeled neurons. Examination of the corneal application site and associated ocular tissues revealed no evidence of tracer spread into neighbouring structures. Small numbers (0-6 per animal) of HRP-labeled neurons were observed in the ipsilateral ciliary and accessory ciliary ganglia of most animals. The results of these carefully controlled studies provide strong anatomical evidence of a modest parasympathetic innervation of the rat cornea."
"9657110","articletitle","Lack of coordinate control of ferritin and transferrin receptor expression during rat liver regeneration."
"9657110","abstracttext","Transferrin receptor (TfR) and ferritin, key proteins of cellular iron metabolism, are coordinately and divergently controlled by cytoplasmic proteins (iron regulatory proteins, IRP-1 and IRP-2) that bind to conserved mRNA motifs called iron-responsive elements (IRE). IRP, in response to specific stimuli (low iron levels, growth and stress signals) are activated and prevent TfR mRNA degradation and ferritin mRNA translation by hindering ferritin mRNA binding to polysomes. We previously found that, in regenerating liver, IRP activation was accompanied by increased TfR mRNA levels, but not by reduced ferritin expression. The basis for this unexpected behavior was investigated in the present study. Liver regeneration triggered by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) stimulated by four- to fivefold the synthesis of both L and H ferritin chains. This increase was accompanied with a transcriptionally regulated twofold rise in the amount of ferritin mRNAs. Moreover, polysome-associated ferritin transcripts were fourfold higher in CCl4-treated animals than in control animals. Because RNA bandshift assays showed a fourfold increase in IRP-2 binding activity after CCl4 administration, activated IRP in regenerating liver seemed unable to prevent ferritin mRNAs binding to polysomes. This was confirmed by direct demonstration in the wheat germ translation system that the efficiency of IRP as a translational repressor of a mRNA bearing an IRE motif in front of a reporter transcript is impaired in CCl4-treated rats in spite of an enhanced IRE-binding capacity. In conclusion, we show for the first time that the paradigm of coordinate and opposite control of ferritin and TfR by IRP is contradicted in liver regeneration. Under these circumstances, growth-dependent signals may activate ferritin gene transcription and at the same time hamper the ability of activated IRP-2 to repress translation of ferritin mRNAs, thus preserving for growing liver cells an essential iron-storage compartment."
"9604882","articletitle","CPRF4a, a novel plant bZIP protein of the CPRF family: comparative analyses of light-dependent expression, post-transcriptional regulation, nuclear import and heterodimerisation."
"9604882","abstracttext","Several DNA-binding proteins with conserved basic region/leucine zipper domains (bZIP) have been isolated from parsley. They all recognise defined ACGT-containing elements (ACEs), including ACE(PcCHSII) in the Light Regulatory Unit LRU1 of the CHS promoter which confers light responsiveness. A new member of this Common Plant Regulatory Factor (CPRF) family, designated CPRF4a, has been cloned, which displays sequence similarity to HBP-1a from wheat, as well as to other plant bZIP proteins. CPRF4a specifically binds as a homodimer to ACE(PcCHSII) and forms heterodimers with CPRF1 but not with CPRF2. In adult parsley plants, CPRF2 and CPRF4a mRNAs are found in all tissues and organs in which the chalcone synthase gene CHS is expressed. In protoplasts from suspension cultured cells, UV irradiation (290-350 nm) did not cause an increase in levels of CPRF1, CPRF2, or CPRF4a mRNA, whereas the corresponding CPRF proteins accumulated within 15 min of light treatment. Furthermore, the rapid light-mediated increase of CPRF proteins was insensitive to transcriptional inhibitors, suggesting that a post-transcriptional mechanism controls CPRF accumulation. CPRFs as well as Arabidopsis thaliana G-box binding factors (GBFs) are selectively transported from the cytosol into the nucleus, as shown in an in vitro nuclear transport system prepared from evacuolated parsley protoplasts, indicating that cytosolic compounds are involved in regulated nuclear targeting of plant bZIP factors."
"10099937","articletitle","Ectopic expression of alpha B-crystallin in Chinese hamster ovary cells suggests a nuclear role for this protein."
"10099937","abstracttext","alpha B-crystallin (alpha B) is known to be a cytosolic, small heat shock-like multimeric protein that has anti-aggregation, chaperone-like properties. The expression of the alpha B-crystallin gene is developmentally regulated and is induced by a variety of stress stimuli. Importantly, alpha B-crystallin expression is enhanced during oncogenic transformation of cells, in a number of tumors, and most notably, in many neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis. Other than its perceived role as a structural protein in the ocular lens, the actual function of alpha B-crystallin in cellular physiology remains unknown. We have stably transfected CHO cells with an inducible alpha B-cDNA-MMTV-promoter construct that allows the synthesis of recombinant alpha B-crystallin only upon exposure of these cells to dexamethasone. Using immunostaining and conventional and confocal microscopy, we have examined the subcellular distribution of the ectopically expressed alpha B-crystallin. We find that in addition to being in the cytoplasm, the protein resides in the nuclear interior in the interphase nucleus. Double labeling with anti alpha B-crystallin and anti-tubulin, concanavallin, and wheat germ agglutinin, respectively, revealed that during cell division alpha B-crystallin is excluded from condensed chromatin and the nascent nuclei. However, the protein again appears in the newly formed nuclei after the completion of cytokinesis suggesting a conditional, regulatory role for alpha B-crystallin in the nucleus."

"11381131","abstracttext","cDNA fragments encoding the carboxyltransferase domain of the multidomain plastid acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) from herbicide-resistant maize and from herbicide-sensitive and herbicide-resistant Lolium rigidum were cloned and sequenced. A Leu residue was found in ACCases from herbicide-resistant plants at a position occupied by Ile in all ACCases from sensitive grasses studied so far. Leu is present at the equivalent position in herbicide-resistant ACCases from other eukaryotes. Chimeric ACCases containing a 1000-aa fragment of two ACCase isozymes found in a herbicide-resistant maize were expressed in a yeast ACC1 null mutant to test herbicide sensitivity of the enzyme in vivo and in vitro. One of the enzymes was resistant/tolerant, and one was sensitive to haloxyfop and sethoxydim, rendering the gene-replacement yeast strains resistant and sensitive to these compounds, respectively. The sensitive enzyme has an Ile residue, and the resistant one has a Leu residue at the putative herbicide-binding site. Additionally, a single Ile to Leu replacement at an equivalent position changes the wheat plastid ACCase from sensitive to resistant. The effect of the opposite substitution, Leu to Ile, makes Toxoplasma gondii apicoplast ACCase resistant to haloxyfop and clodinafop. In this case, inhibition of the carboxyltransferase activity of ACCase (second half-reaction) of a large fragment of the Toxoplasma enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli was tested. The critical amino acid residue is located close to a highly conserved motif of the carboxyltransferase domain, which is probably a part of the enzyme active site, providing the basis for the activity of fop and dim herbicides."

"11370010","abstracttext","The objective of the present study was to characterize further the vagal afferent fibers in the rat esophagus, particularly those in its uppermost part, their cell bodies in vagal sensory ganglia, and their central projections. We applied immunohistochemistry for calretinin, calbindin, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP); retrograde tracing with FluoroGold; and transganglionic tracing with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase in combination with neurectomies. Vagal terminal structures in the muscularis propria of the whole esophagus consisted of calretinin-immunoreactive intraganglionic laminar endings that were linked to cervical vagal and recurrent laryngeal nerve pathways. The mucosa of the uppermost esophagus was innervated by a very dense net of longitudinally arranged, calretinin-positive fibers that were depleted by section of the superior laryngeal nerve. Distal to this area, the mucosa was virtually devoid of calretinin-immunoreactive vagal afferents. Calretinin-positive mucosal fibers in the upper cervical esophagus were classified into four types. One type, the finger-like endings, was sometimes immunoreactive also for CGRP. About one-third of cell bodies in vagal sensory ganglia retrogradely labeled from the upper cervical esophagus expressed CGRP, whereas two-thirds coexpressed calretinin and calbindin but not CGRP. In addition to the central subnucleus of the nucleus of the solitary tract, vagal afferents from the upper cervical esophagus also projected heavily to the interstitial subnucleus. This additional projection was attributed to mucosal afferents traveling through the superior laryngeal nerve. The present study provides a possible morphological basis for bronchopulmonary and aversive reflexes elicited upon stimulation of the esophagus."

"10873783","abstracttext","A monoclonal antibody, 5H4, that recognizes human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7) was used in Western analysis to probe HHV-7-infected SupT1 cells. This antibody recognizes a 40-kDa virus-specific polypeptide that is expressed in the absence of viral DNA synthesis. By screening a lambdagt11 HHV-7 cDNA library, the gene encoding the protein was identified as the U27 open reading frame previously reported [J. Virol. (1996) 70, 5975-5989]. Immunofluorescent studies showed a punctate nuclear localization of the protein in both HHV-7-infected cells and transfected cells. A computer program predicted two classic nuclear localization signals (NLSs) in the middle and C-terminal regions of the protein. A C-terminal deletion mutant of the protein could not enter the nucleus, whereas green fluorescent protein or maltose binding protein fused to the C-terminal region of the protein was transported into the nucleus. These findings demonstrate that the predicted C-terminal, but not middle, NLS of the protein actually function as NLS. In addition, nuclear transport of a maltose binding protein-fusion protein containing the C-terminal NLS of the U27 protein was inhibited by both wheat germ agglutinin and a Q69L Ran-GTP mutant, indicating that the U27 protein is transported into the nucleus from the cytoplasm by means of classic nuclear transport machinery. Interestingly, this NLS motif is highly conserved at the C-termini of all herpesvirus DNA polymerase processivity factors that have been examined."
"11027162","articletitle","Investigating the secretory pathway of the baculovirus-insect cell system using a secretory green fluorescent protein."
"11027162","abstracttext","The secretory pathway is important in actively transporting proteins into the extracellular environment of eucaryotic cells. In this study a green fluorescent protein (GFP) mutant engineered to contain a secretion signal was used as a model protein in order to visualize the secretion process inside insect cells. Fluorescent microscopy indicated that significant amounts of secreted green fluorescent protein (sGFP) accumulated in High-Five, Trichoplusia ni, cells following infection with a baculovirus vector containing the gene under the polyhedrin promoter. Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to reconstruct whole cell images of the infected High-Five cells at multiple days postinfection. While the protein was widely distributed at 2 days postinfection, certain intracellular regions appeared to contain higher or lower concentrations of the sGFP. A layer by layer examination indicated pockets in which sGFP was absent, and these appear to be vesicles that have recently released the sGFP or are not yet accumulating sGFP. By 3 days postinfection, the sGFP in some cells was concentrated in a number of widely dispersed globules, which may represent the vesicle remnants of a deteriorating secretory pathway. In contrast, nonsecreted GFP was more uniformly distributed in the cells than sGFP and did not accumulate in vesicles. In addition to GFP, the lectins wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and concanavalin A (ConA), which have affinities for sugar residues, were used to examine the secretory pathway. The WGA, which is a Golgi marker, was distributed around the nucleus prior to infection but then was found to be polarized in one region of the cell following the baculovirus infection. The expansion of other cellular compartments following the baculovirus infection may have caused a change in intracellular distribution of the Golgi. While some of the sGFP was found to colocalize with the WGA label, much of the sGFP was outside this Golgi region. In contrast, ConA labeling, which was not as specific as WGA, was found throughout the cell both before and after infection similar to the sGFP distribution. These studies demonstrate that confocal visualization of fluorescent proteins can be used as an in vivo tool for examining secretory processing in insect cells."

"11029043","abstracttext","The study of the nuclear pore in vertebrates would benefit from a strategy to directly identify new nucleoporins and interactions between those nucleoporins. We have developed a novel two-step ""organelle trap"" assay involving affinity selection and in vitro pore assembly. In the first step, soluble proteins derived from Xenopus egg extracts are applied to a column containing a ligand of interest. The bound proteins are then tagged by biotinylation and eluted. In the second step, potential nucleoporins are selected for by virtue of their ability to assemble into annulate lamellae, a cytoplasmic mimic of nuclear pores. The incorporated proteins are then recognized by their biotin tag. Here we use the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) as ligand; WGA inhibits nuclear transport and has been shown to directly bind three known nucleoporins from Xenopus extract, Nup62, Nup98, and Nup214, all of which contain N-acetylglucosamine residues. Under reduced-stringency conditions, three additional proteins bind to WGA-Sepharose and are revealed by the organelle trap assay. We identified all three as partner nucleoporins. Two were discovered to be Xenopus Nup93 and Nup205. The third is a novel vertebrate nucleoporin, Nup188. This new vertebrate protein, Xenopus Nup188, exists in a complex with xNup93 and xNup205. The Nup93-Nup188-Nup205 complex does not bind directly to WGA but binds indirectly via the N-acetylglucosamine-modified nucleoporins. A gene encoding human Nup188 was also identified. The discovery of vertebrate Nup188, related to a yeast nucleoporin, and its novel protein-protein interactions illustrates the power of the two-step organelle trap assay and identifies new building blocks for constructing the nuclear pore."

"11074451","abstracttext","Intraganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs) and intramuscular arrays (IMAs), the two putative mechanoreceptors that the vagus nerve supplies to the gastrointestinal smooth muscle, have been characterized almost exclusively in the rat. To provide normative inventories of these afferents for the mouse, the authors examined the endings in the stomach and small intestine of three strains used as backgrounds for gene manipulations (i.e., C57, 129/SvJ, and WBB6). Animals received nodose ganglion injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or dextran-tetramethylrhodamine conjugated to biotin. The horseradish peroxidase tissue was processed with tetramethylbenzidine and was used to map the distributions and densities of the two endings; the dextran material was counterstained with c-Kit immunohistochemistry to assess interactions between intramuscular arrays and interstitial cells of Cajal. IGLEs and IMAs constituted the vagal innervation of mouse gastric and duodenal smooth muscle. IGLE morphology and distributions, with peak densities in the corpus-antrum, were similar in the three strains of mice and comparable to those observed in rats. IMAs varied in complexity from region to region but tended to be simpler (fewer telodendria) in mice than in rats. IMAs were most concentrated in the forestomach and sphincters in mice, as in rats, but the topographic distributions of the endings varied both between strains of mice (subtly) and between species (more dramatically). IMAs appeared to make appositions with both interstitial cells and smooth muscle fibers. This survey should make it practical to assay the effects of genetic (e.g., knockout) and experimental (e.g., regeneration) manipulations affecting visceral afferents and their target tissues."

"10890529","abstracttext","Intracellular Ca(2+) has been implicated in the signal transduction processes during the development of the plant defense system against fungal pathogens. From wheat cultured cells that had been treated with the elicitor derived from Typhula ishikariensis, the ccd-1 gene encoding a 14 kDa Ca(2+)-binding protein with an acidic amphiphilic feature was isolated. The ccd-1-encoded protein (CCD-1) shares homology to the C-terminal half domain of centrin, a Ca(2+)-binding protein conserved in eukaryotes. Unlike typical eukaryotic centrins, CCD-1 contains only one Ca(2+)-binding loop, which corresponds to the one in the fourth EF-hand from the N-terminus of centrin. The recombinant CCD protein expressed in Escherichia coli bound to a phenyl-Sepharose column in the presence of Ca(2+) and was eluted out by EGTA. It also showed a Ca(2+)-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift on the non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The ccd-1 mRNA expression was rapidly induced by treatment with fungal and chitosan oligosaccharide elicitors, implying that it might have a role in transducing Ca(2+) signals provoked by the elicitors. The expression of the ccd-1 mRNA was induced by treatment with A23187, and the induction was suppressed by La(3+) or 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). This study suggests the involvement of intracellular Ca(2+) in the elicitor-induced mRNA expression of a novel class of Ca(2+)-binding proteins conserved in higher plants."
"10900270","articletitle","New roles for cis-jasmone as an insect semiochemical and in plant defense."
"10900270","abstracttext","cis-jasmone, or (Z)-jasmone, is well known as a component of plant volatiles, and its release can be induced by damage, for example during insect herbivory. Using the olfactory system of the lettuce aphid to investigate volatiles from plants avoided by this insect, (Z)-jasmone was found to be electrophysiologically active and also to be repellent in laboratory choice tests. In field studies, repellency from traps was demonstrated for the damson-hop aphid, and with cereal aphids numbers were reduced in plots of winter wheat treated with (Z)-jasmone. In contrast, attractant activity was found in laboratory and wind tunnel tests for insects acting antagonistically to aphids, namely the seven-spot ladybird and an aphid parasitoid. When applied in the vapor phase to intact bean plants, (Z)-jasmone induced the production of volatile compounds, including the monoterpene (E)-beta-ocimene, which affect plant defense, for example by stimulating the activity of parasitic insects. These plants were more attractive to the aphid parasitoid in the wind tunnel when tested 48 h after exposure to (Z)-jasmone had ceased. This possible signaling role of (Z)-jasmone is qualitatively different from that of the biosynthetically related methyl jasmonate and gives a long-lasting effect after removal of the stimulus. Differential display was used to compare mRNA populations in bean leaves exposed to the vapor of (Z)-jasmone and methyl jasmonate. One differentially displayed fragment was cloned and shown by Northern blotting to be up-regulated in leaf tissue by (Z)-jasmone. This sequence was identified by homology as being derived from a gene encoding an alpha-tubulin isoform."

Transformed plantlets have been recovered after electroporation using field strengths of 275 and 750 V/cm, 960-µF capacitor and 50 µg/ml of linear plasmid DNA, containing bar and uidA genes. The field strength of 750 V/cm proved to be more effective for DNA delivery (estimated by transient GUS expression) and for recovery of transformed plants (two transgenic plants were recovered with an efficiency of 0.4%). After application of a field strength of 275 V/cm there was no visual evidence of transient GUS expression, but one transgenic plant was recovered with an efficiency of 0.2%, based on the number of electroporated embryos. This indicates that the amount of DNA delivered into the cells was too low for visual identification of transient GUS expression and that GUS expression may not provide an appropriate assessment of the efficiency of DNA delivery. Southern blot hybridisation has revealed a low copy number of transgene integration with some rearrangements in integrated loci. None of the transgenic plants has shown any visual GUS expression, although we could amplify the transcript of the uidA gene in T(0) progeny using RT-PCR. This may indicate that suppression of uidA expression occurred at the post-transcriptional level. The efficiency of tissue electroporation is still dependent on the quality of the plant material which is used but the transformation events were reproducible from one group of experiments to another. At present, this technique is dependent on a combination of factors including pretreatments of the recipient tissue, quality of tissue culture and optimisation of electroporation conditions."
"10423425","articletitle","Evolutionary relationship between K(+) channels and symporters."
"10423425","abstracttext","The hypothesis is presented that at least four families of putative K(+) symporter proteins, Trk and KtrAB from prokaryotes, Trk1,2 from fungi, and HKT1 from wheat, evolved from bacterial K(+) channel proteins. Details of this hypothesis are organized around the recently determined crystal structure of a bacterial K(+) channel: i. e., KcsA from Streptomyces lividans. Each of the four identical subunits of this channel has two fully transmembrane helices (designated M1 and M2), plus an intervening hairpin segment that determines the ion selectivity (designated P). The symporter sequences appear to contain four sequential M1-P-M2 motifs (MPM), which are likely to have arisen from gene duplication and fusion of the single MPM motif of a bacterial K(+) channel subunit. The homology of MPM motifs is supported by a statistical comparison of the numerical profiles derived from multiple sequence alignments formed for each protein family. Furthermore, these quantitative results indicate that the KtrAB family of symporters has remained closest to the single-MPM ancestor protein. Strong sequence evidence is also found for homology between the cytoplasmic C-terminus of numerous bacterial K(+) channels and the cytoplasm-resident TrkA and KtrA subunits of the Trk and KtrAB symporters, which in turn are homologous to known dinucleotide-binding domains of other proteins. The case for homology between bacterial K(+) channels and the four families of K(+) symporters is further supported by the accompanying manuscript, in which the patterns of residue conservation are demonstrated to be similar to each other and consistent with the known 3D structure of the KcsA K(+) channel."

"10734185","abstracttext","ADP-ribose 1"",2""-cyclic phosphate (Appr>p) is produced in yeast and other eukaryotes as a consequence of tRNA splicing. This molecule is converted to ADP-ribose 1""-phosphate (Appr-1""p) by the action of the cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (CPDase). Comparison of the previously cloned CPDase from Arabidopsis with proteins having related cyclic phosphodiesterase or RNA ligase activities revealed two histidine-containing tetrapeptides conserved in these enzyme families. Using the consensus phosphodiesterase signature, we have identified the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae open reading frame YGR247w as encoding CPDase. The bacterially expressed yeast protein, named Cpd1p, is able to hydrolyze Appr>p to Appr-1""p. Moreover, as with the previously characterized Arabidopsis and wheat CPDases, Cpd1p hydrolyzes nucleosides 2',3'-cyclic phosphates (N>p) to nucleosides 2'-phosphates. Apparent K (m)values for Appr>p, A>p, U>p, C>p and G>p are 0.37, 4.97, 8.91, 12.18 and 14.29 mM, respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acids within the two conserved tetrapeptides showed that H(40)and H(150)residues are essential for CPDase activity. Deletion analysis has indicated that the CPD1 gene is not important for cellular viability. Likewise, overexpression of Cpd1p had no effect on yeast growth. These results do not implicate an important role for Appr>p or Appr-1""p in yeast cells grown under standard laboratory conditions."

"10699669","abstracttext","The detection of bacteria in environmental samples using genetic markers is valuable in microbial ecology. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene was studied under nutrient starvation conditions at 4 degrees C, 23 degrees C and 30 degrees C in Pseudomonas fluorescens R2fG1 cells tagged with a red-shifted gfp. Fluorescence intensity was not significantly different in cells maintained in a buffer for at least 48 days at all the tested temperatures. gfp-Tagged R2fG1 cells were introduced into bulk soil microcosms and soil microcosms with wheat seedlings. GFP-marked cells were enumerated immediately after inoculation into soil and again in soil and root samples after 10 days. Counts of culturable colonies were obtained from drop plates using 5-microl aliquots of serial dilutions viewed with an epifluorescent microscope. Traditional spread plates (using 100-microl aliquots) and the most-probable-number (MPN) method using a spectrofluorometer were also used to enumerate the GFP-marked Pseudomonas cells in soil, rhizosphere and rhizoplane samples. Microcolonies were visualized on root surfaces under the epifluorescent microscope after immobilizing in agar and incubation for 24 h. Counts from traditional spread plates were significantly higher (P<0.05) than the population estimates of the MPN method for all treatments at any sampling time. Counts using the drop plate method, however, were not significantly different (P<0.05) except in one treatment, and provided similar estimates in half the time of spread plates and at an estimated third of the cost."

"10809724","abstracttext","The high risk human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are associated with carcinomas of cervix and other genital tumors. Previous studies have identified two viral oncoproteins E6 and E7, which are expressed in the majority of HPV-associated carcinomas. The ability of high risk HPV E6 protein to immortalize human mammary epithelial cells has provided a single gene model to study the mechanisms of E6-induced oncogenic transformation. In recent years, it has become clear that in addition to E6-induced degradation of p53 tumor suppressor protein, other targets of E6 are required for mammary epithelial cells immortalization. Using the yeast two-hybrid system, we have identified a novel interaction of HPV16 E6 with protein kinase PKN, a fatty acid- and Rho small G protein-activated serine/threonine kinase with a catalytic domain highly homologous to protein kinase C. We demonstrate direct binding of high risk HPV E6 proteins to PKN in wheat-germ lysate in vitro and in 293T cells in vivo. Importantly, E6 proteins of high risk HPVs but not low risk HPVs were able to bind PKN. Furthermore, all the immortalization-competent and many immortalization-non-competent E6 mutants bind PKN. These data suggest that binding to PKN may be required but not sufficient for immortalizing normal mammary epithelial cells. Finally, we show that PKN phosphorylates E6, demonstrating for the first time that HPV E6 is a phosphoprotein. Our finding suggests a novel link between HPV E6 mediated oncogenesis and regulation of a well known phosphorylation cascade."

"10449582","abstracttext","All flowering plants produce S-methylmethionine (SMM) from Met and have a separate mechanism to convert SMM back to Met. The functions of SMM and the reasons for its interconversion with Met are not known. In this study, by using the aphid stylet collection method together with mass spectral and radiolabeling analyses, we established that l-SMM is a major constituent of the phloem sap moving to wheat ears. The SMM level in the phloem ( approximately 2% of free amino acids) was 1.5-fold that of glutathione, indicating that SMM could contribute approximately half the sulfur needed for grain protein synthesis. Similarly, l-SMM was a prominently labeled product in phloem exudates obtained by EDTA treatment of detached leaves from plants of the Poaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, and Cucurbitaceae that were given l-(35)S-Met. cDNA clones for the enzyme that catalyzes SMM synthesis (S-adenosylMet:Met S-methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.12) were isolated from Wollastonia biflora, maize, and Arabidopsis. The deduced amino acid sequences revealed the expected methyltransferase domain ( approximately 300 residues at the N terminus), plus an 800-residue C-terminal region sharing significant similarity with aminotransferases and other pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzymes. These results indicate that SMM has a previously unrecognized but often major role in sulfur transport in flowering plants and that evolution of SMM synthesis in this group involved a gene fusion event. The resulting bipartite enzyme is unlike any other known methyltransferase."
"10662614","articletitle","Multiple interactions among proteins encoded by the mite-transmitted wheat streak mosaic tritimovirus."
"10662614","abstracttext","The genome organization of the mite-transmitted wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) appears to parallel that of members of the Potyviridae with monopartite genomes, but there are substantial amino acid dissimilarities with other potyviral polyproteins. To initiate studies on the functions of WSMV-encoded proteins, a protein interaction map was generated using a yeast two-hybrid system. Because the pathway of proteolytic maturation of the WSMV polyprotein has not been experimentally determined, random libraries of WSMV cDNA were made both in DNA-binding domain and activation domain plasmid vectors and introduced into yeast. Sequence analysis of multiple interacting pairs revealed that interactions largely occurred between domains within two groups of proteins. The first involved interactions among nuclear inclusion protein a, nuclear inclusion protein b, and coat protein (CP), and the second involved helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) and cylindrical inclusion protein (CI). Further immunoblot and deletion mapping analyses of the interactions suggest that subdomains of CI, HC-Pro, and P1 interact with one another. The two-hybrid assay was then performed using full-length genes of CI, HC-Pro, P1, P3, and CP, but no heterologous interactions were detected. In vitro binding assay using glutathione-S-transferase fusion proteins and in vitro translation products, however, revealed mutual interactions among CI, HC-Pro, P1, and P3. The failure to detect interactions between full-length proteins by the two-hybrid assay might be due to adverse effects of expression of viral proteins in yeast cells. The capacity to participate in multiple homomeric and heteromeric molecular interactions is consistent with the pleiotropic nature of many potyviral gene mutants and suggests mechanisms for regulation of various viral processes via a network of viral protein complexes."

"12965078","abstracttext","Isolation of primitive blood stem cells by different methods results in cell populations with distinct biological activities. This study was aimed at resolving differences in the frequency of multilineage reconstituting cells (MRC) and their precursors (pMRC) in cell populations isolated by positive selection for Sca-1 compared to those isolated by negative selection for 15-1.1. Separation of wheat germ agglutinin-positive mouse bone marrow cells into 15-1.1neg or Sca-1+ subsets was performed by flow cytometry. The isolated cells were transplanted into W/Wv or normal irradiated recipient mice and reconstitution was evaluated over time. Sca-1+ cells were less frequent and contained more MRC than 15-1.1neg cells, while pMRC were found mainly among 15-1.1neg cells. MRC activity was exclusively contained within the Sca-1+ subpopulation of 15-1.1neg cells, but marrow from 7 robustly engrafted W/Wv mice did not contain donor-derived MRC, indicating that 15-1.1negSca-1+ cells contain low numbers of pMRC. Functional differences between 15-1.1neg and Sca-1+ cells were further confirmed by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR gene expression analysis. Early hematopoiesis-specific transcription factors (Scl, Gata-2, and Gata-1) were amplified from cDNA prepared from Sca-1+ but not 15-1.1neg cells. This study indicates that cell populations isolated as Sca-1+ are functionally distinct from those isolated as 15-1.1neg in that few pMRC are included among Sca-1+ cells and that MRC and pMRC are two distinct and separable cell populations."
"11587511","articletitle","Promoters for pregenomic RNA of banana streak badnavirus are active for transgene expression in monocot and dicot plants."
"11587511","abstracttext","Two putative promoters from Australian banana streak badnavirus (BSV) isolates were analysed for activity in different plant species. In transient expression systems the My (2105 bp) and Cv (1322 bp) fragments were both shown to have promoter activity in a wide range of plant species including monocots (maize, barley, banana, millet, wheat, sorghum), dicots (tobacco, canola, sunflower, Nicotiana benthamiana, tipu tree), gymnosperm (Pinus radiata) and fern (Nephrolepis cordifolia). Evaluation of the My and Cv promoters in transgenic sugarcane, banana and tobacco plants demonstrated that these promoters could drive high-level expression of either the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene (uidA) in vegetative plant cells. In transgenic sugarcane plants harbouring the Cv promoter, GFP expression levels were comparable or higher (up to 1.06% of total soluble leaf protein as GFP) than those of plants containing the maize ubiquitin promoter (up to 0.34% of total soluble leaf protein). GUS activities in transgenic in vitro-grown banana plants containing the My promoter were up to seven-fold stronger in leaf tissue and up to four-fold stronger in root and corm tissue than in plants harbouring the maize ubiquitin promoter. The Cv promoter showed activities that were similar to the maize ubiquitin promoter in in vitro-grown banana plants, but was significantly reduced in larger glasshouse-grown plants. In transgenic in vitro-grown tobacco plants, the My promoter reached activities close to those of the 35S promoter of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV), while the Cv promoter was about half as active as the CaMV 35S promoter. The BSV promoters for pregenomic RNA represent useful tools for the high-level expression of foreign genes in transgenic monocots."

"11739861","abstracttext","Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and its component hydroxy fatty acids were shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activating receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and gamma (PPARgamma). To test the hypothesis that lipid oxidation products in oxidized frying oil (OFO) can activate PPARalpha and up-regulate its target genes, a feeding experiment and a transactivation experiment were conducted. Based on a 2 x 2 factorial design, four groups of Sprague-Dawley male weanling rats were fed diets containing either high (20 g/100 g, HO and HF) or low (5 g/100 g, LO and LF) levels of oxidized frying soybean oil (HO and LO) or fresh soybean oil (HF and LF) for 6 wk. The OFO sample was prepared by frying wheat dough sheets in soybean oil at 205 +/- 5 degrees C for 24 h. OFO dose dependently and significantly increased (P < 0.05) mRNA of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and cytochrome P(450) 4A1(CYP4A1) in liver of rats. Dietary OFO also dose dependently increased liver microsomal CYP4A protein (P < 0.05). The activity of hepatic ACO of the HO group was sixfold that of the HF group (P < 0.05). Plasma total lipids, liver triglycerides, cholesterol and total lipids were reduced in rats fed the LO and HO diets (P < 0.05). Through the ligand binding domain of PPARalpha, the hydrolyzed OFO enhanced the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) reporter gene to a significantly greater extent (P < 0.05) than the hydrolyzed fresh soybean oil in a transactivation assay using a clone of CHO K1 cells stably expressing Gal4-PPARalpha chimeric receptor and UAS4-ALP reporter. The results support our hypothesis that dietary OFO, by activating PPARalpha, up-regulates the expression of PPARalpha downstream genes and alters lipid metabolism in rats."

The system enables a 35-cycle PCR with 32 samples do be completed in 45 min, including quantification and identification of the product. It is therefore well suited for routine analysis of large numbers of samples in quality control and for defining HACCP concepts. Based on PCR primers specific to the tri5 gene, a quantitative group specific assay was established for Fusarium species producing trichothecenes. In the assay, SYBR Green I was used as fluorescent dye enabling real time detection of PCR products. Characterisation of the amplicons was achieved by melting point analysis (85 +/- 0.1 degrees C). Nonspecific products such as primer dimers could readily be distinguished from the product by their lower melting points. Composition of the amplification buffer was optimised and various hot start methods were tested in order to achieve the highest sensitivity of the assay. Uracil DNA glycosylase was added to prevent amplification of nonspecific products due to DNA carryover. The spectrum of species detected was generally in accordance with the results found in conventional PCR using the Tox5 primer pair. Reproducibility in six parallel experiments of the assay was determined to be 98% in the range between 0.05 and 6 ng of purified Fusarium graminearum DNA. The assay was used to analyse 30 wheat samples contaminated with toxigenic Fusarium spp. Contamination ranged from 0% to 78% as revealed by mycological analysis, and this is compared with results from the LightCycler. This is the first report on the use of the LightCycler system in combination with SYBR Green I for the quantification and identification of fungal DNA in pure cultures and sample material."

"11713671","abstracttext","The promoter region of the rice ubiquitin2 (rubq2) gene was found to be polymorphic between japonica (T309) and indica (IR24) lines as the result of a 270-bp deletion in T309. A TTATA footprint in the T309 rubq2 promoter suggested that an excision event had occurred, and inspection of the 270-bp region present in IR24 revealed that it had all the characteristics of a miniature inverted repeat transposable element (MITE). Database searches showed that this element is a member of a new MITE family, which we have named Kiddo. Thirty-five complete Kiddo sequences were identified in existing rice genomic sequence databases. They could be arranged into four groups, within-group sequence identity was over 90%, with 65-75% identity between groups. The high sequence similarity within a group indicates that some Kiddo members were recently mobile and may still be active. An additional 24 decayed Kiddo sequences were detected. Interestingly, approximately 80% of 18 Kiddo members from annotated accessions lie within 530 bp of a coding sequence. That approximately 40% of Kiddo members present in genic regions reside in introns suggests that Kiddo transposition entails the use of both DNA and RNA intermediates, and may provide some insight into the origins of individual groups. DNA blot analysis showed that Kiddo is a rice-specific element, although one sequence with limited (72%) similarity to Kiddo group A was detected as a wheat EST. Kiddo family members may represent new molecular and phylogenetic markers, as well as representing valuable materials for studying the molecular mechanisms of MITE transposition."

"11714986","abstracttext","Recombination between divergent virus genomes is believed to be a major mechanism for generation of novel virus genotypes. We have examined the recombination process in geminiviruses by forcing recombination between two distinct isolates of Maize streak virus (MSV), MSV-Kom and MSV-Set. Heterodimeric agroinfectious constructs containing tandemly cloned mixtures of complete or partial MSV-Set and MSV-Kom genomes were used to simulate a circular dimeric form similar to that which would be expected to occur following a single intermolecular crossing-over event between MSV-Set and MSV-Kom replicative form DNAs at the long intergenic region (LIR)-movement protein gene (MP) interface. We isolated, analysed and biologically characterized many of the recombinant MSV genomes that were generated from the constructs in planta. Apart from having the same simulated breakpoint at the LIR-MP interface, all the genomes examined had a second breakpoint that had been generated through either intramolecular homologous recombination or a replicational release mechanism. The pathogenicities of six predominantly MSV-Kom-like recombinants were tested in maize. While all were capable of producing a symptomatic infection in this host, none was more virulent than MSV-Kom and only two were more virulent than MSV-Set. The two most virulent recombinants were leafhopper transmitted to a range of differentially MSV-resistant maize, wheat and barley genotypes and both were found to have unique biological properties."

"11708884","abstracttext","Inefficient nuclear delivery restricts transgene expression using polyelectrolyte DNA vectors. To increase transfer from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, we have covalently linked adenovirus hexon protein to polyethylenimine (PEI, 800 kDa). Activity of the conjugate was compared with PEI and PEI linked to albumin. Hexon-containing complexes gave 10-fold greater transgene expression in HepG2 cells than PEI/DNA or complexes containing albumin, without increasing cell uptake. Following cytoplasmic injection into Xenopus laevis oocytes, hexon-containing complexes showed reporter gene expression to be elevated by 10-fold compared with PEI/DNA. The ability of hexon to promote nuclear delivery of PEI/DNA nanoparticles was compared with that of classical nuclear localization sequences (NLS) by measuring transgene expression following intracytoplasmic microinjection of hexon-PEI/DNA complexes and NLS-albumin-PEI/DNA complexes in rat-1 fibroblasts. The resulting nuclear transfer efficiency was in the following order: hexon-PEI/DNA>NLS-albumin-PEI/DNA>PEI/DNA>DNA alone>albumin-PEI/DNA. The activities of both NLS-albumin-PEI and hexon-PEI were abolished by co-injection of wheat germ agglutinin, suggesting that both act by means of the nuclear pore complex (NPC); in contrast, excess free NLS-albumin abolished transgene expression with NLS-albumin-PEI/DNA, but only partially inhibited hexon-PEI/DNA. Nuclear transfer efficiency following cytoplasmic injection was dependent on DNA concentration for all materials, although hexon conjugates showed much better activity than NLS-albumin at low DNA doses (500-1000 plasmids/cell). Our data are consistent with hexon mediating nuclear delivery of plasmid complexes by means of the NPC, using mechanisms that are only partially dependent on the classical NLS import pathway. The hexon-mediated mechanism of nuclear import enables substantially better transgene expression, particularly when DNA concentrations in the cytoplasm are limiting."

"11669637","abstracttext","Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1/CD31) is a 130K transmembrane glycoprotein that belongs to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily and is expressed on the surface of hematological or vascular cells, including platelets and endothelial cells. Although the importance of this adhesion molecule in various cell-cell interactions is established, its function in platelets remains ill-defined. In the process of clarifying the mechanism by which the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) activates platelets, we unexpectedly discovered that PECAM-1 is involved in signal transduction pathways elicited by this N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (NAGlu)-reactive lectin. WGA, which is a very potent platelet stimulator, elicited a rapid surge in Syk and phospholipase C (PLC)-gamma 2 tyrosine phosphorylation and the resultant intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization; collagen, as reported, induced these responses, but in a much slower and weaker manner. WGA strongly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of a 130-140K protein, which was confirmed to be PECAM-1 by immunoprecipitation and immunodepletion studies. WGA-induced PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation occurred rapidly, strongly and in a manner independent of platelet aggregation or cell-cell contact; these characteristics of PECAM-1 phosphorylation were not mimicked at all by receptor-mediated platelet agonists. In addition, WGA was found to associate with PECAM-1 itself, and anti-PECAM-1 antibody, as well as NAGlu, specifically inhibited WGA-induced platelet aggregation. In PECAM-1 immunoprecipitates, Src family tyrosine kinases existed, and a kinase activity was detected, which increased upon WGA stimulation. Furthermore, the Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 inhibited WGA-induced platelet aggregation, Ca(2+) mobilization, and PLC-gamma 2 tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, WGA induced PECAM-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and cytoskeletal reorganization in vascular endothelial cells. Our results suggest that (i) PECAM-1 is involved in WGA-induced platelet activation, (ii) PECAM-1 clustering by WGA activates unique and strong platelet signaling pathways, leading to a rapid PLC activation via Src family kinases, and (iii) WGA is a useful tool for elucidating PECAM-1-mediated signaling with wide implications not confined to platelets."

"11722920","abstracttext","Broiler chickens from eight commercial farms in Southern Finland were analyzed for the structure of their gastrointestinal microbial community by a nonselective DNA-based method, percent G+C-based profiling. The bacteriological impact of the feed source and in-farm whole-wheat amendment of the diet was assessed by percent G+C profiling. Also, a phylogenetic 16S rRNA gene (rDNA)-based study was carried out to aid in interpretation of the percent G+C profiles. This survey showed that most of the 16S rDNA sequences found could not be assigned to any previously known bacterial genus or they represented an unknown species of one of the taxonomically heterogeneous genera, such as Ruminococcus or Clostridium. The data from bacterial community profiling were analyzed by t-test, multiple linear regression, and principal-component statistical approaches. The percent G+C profiling method with appropriate statistical analyses detected microbial community differences smaller than 10% within each 5% increment of the percent G+C profiles. Diet turned out to be the strongest determinant of the cecal bacterial community structure. Both the source of feed and local feed amendment changed the bacteriological profile significantly, whereas profiles of individual farms with identical feed regimens hardly differed from each other. This suggests that the management of typical Finnish farms is relatively uniform or that hygiene on the farm, in fact, has little impact on the structure of the cecal bacterial community. Therefore, feed compounders should have a significant role in the modulation of gut microflora and consequently in prevention of gastrointestinal disorders in farm animals."
"15653639","articletitle","Plant tRNA ligases are multifunctional enzymes that have diverged in sequence and substrate specificity from RNA ligases of other phylogenetic origins."
"15653639","abstracttext","Pre-tRNA splicing is an essential process in all eukaryotes. It requires the concerted action of an endonuclease to remove the intron and a ligase for joining the resulting tRNA halves as studied best in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we report the first characterization of an RNA ligase protein and its gene from a higher eukaryotic organism that is an essential component of the pre-tRNA splicing process. Purification of tRNA ligase from wheat germ by successive column chromatographic steps has identified a protein of 125 kDa by its potentiality to covalently bind AMP, and by its ability to catalyse the ligation of tRNA halves and the circularization of linear introns. Peptide sequences obtained from the purified protein led to the elucidation of the corresponding proteins and their genes in Arabidopsis and Oryza databases. The plant tRNA ligases exhibit no overall sequence homologies to any known RNA ligases, however, they harbour a number of conserved motifs that indicate the presence of three intrinsic enzyme activities: an adenylyltransferase/ligase domain in the N-terminal region, a polynucleotide kinase in the centre and a cyclic phosphodiesterase domain at the C-terminal end. In vitro expression of the recombinant Arabidopsis tRNA ligase and functional analyses revealed all expected individual activities. Plant RNA ligases are active on a variety of substrates in vitro and are capable of inter- and intramolecular RNA joining. Hence, we conclude that their role in vivo might comprise yet unknown essential functions besides their involvement in pre-tRNA splicing."

"15655105","abstracttext_background and aims","The gibberellin-insensitive Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b dwarfing genes are known to reduce the size of cells in culms, leaves and coleoptiles of wheat. Resulting leaf area development of gibberellin-insensitive wheats is poor compared to standard height (Rht-B1a and Rht-D1a) genotypes. Alternative dwarfing genes to Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b are available that reduce plant height, such as the gibberellin-responsive Rht8 gene. This study aims to investigate if Rht8 has a similar dwarfing effect on the size of leaf cells to reduce leaf area."
"15655105","abstracttext_methods","The effect of Rht8 on cell size and leaf area was assessed in four types of epidermal cells (interstomatal, long, sister and bulliform) measured on leaf 2 of standard height (rht8) and semi-dwarf (Rht8) doubled-haploid lines (DHLs). The DHLs were derived from a cross between very vigorous, standard height (rht8) ('Vigour18') and less vigorous, semi-dwarf (Rht8) ('Chuan-Mai 18') parents."
"15655105","abstracttext_key results","Large differences were observed in seedling vigour between the parents, where 'Vigour18' had a much greater plant leaf area than 'Chuan-Mai 18'. Accordingly, 'Vigour18' had on average longer, wider and more epidermal cells and cell files than 'Chuan-Mai 18'. Although there was correspondingly large genotypic variation among DHLs for these traits, the contrast between semi-dwarf Rht8 and tall rht8 DHLs revealed no difference in the size of leaf 2 or average cell characteristics. Hence, these traits were independent of plant height and therefore Rht8 in the DHLs. Correlations for leaf and average cell size across DHLs revealed a strong and positive relationship between leaf width and cell files, while the relationships between leaf and cell width, and leaf and cell length were not statistically different. The relative contribution of the four cell types (long, sister, interstomatal and bulliform) to leaf size in the parents, comparative controls and DHLs is discussed."

The combinations were: two hypervirulent strains, AGL1, containing the pDM805 binary plasmid, and EHA101, containing pGAH; and the common Agro strain LBA4404, harboring the super-binary pTOK233 vector. pDM805 contained bar under the control of Ubi1 promoter, pGAH had nptII under nos, and pTOK233 had hpt under 35S. Additionally, pDM805 and pTOK233 carried the gus reporter gene under the Act1 promoter or 35S promoter, respectively. The highest selection rate was 12.6% and was obtained with EHA101(pGAH) on a kanamycin-containing medium. Sixty-five of the plants grown on that medium were PCR positive. The second best combination was LBA4404(pTOK233) and kanamycin selection, which gave an average transformation rate of 2.3%. Phosphinothricin selection gave 1.0% transformation efficiency, while hygromycin, depending on the strain/vector used, gave from 0.2 to 0.4%. PCR tests in T1 revealed that 67% of the lines showed a 3:1 segregation ratio, and 11% a 15:1 ratio, while in 22%, segregation was non-Mendelian. The high number of T0 transgenic plants containing one copy of the transgene was confirmed via Southern blot analysis. Kanamycin resistance in the T1 generation was very low; in some lines, all the progeny were kanamycin sensitive. GUS expression, only tested in young T1 plants, was in agreement with Mendelian segregation in three out of the twelve tested. The factors influencing the efficiency of selection and transgene expression are discussed in this paper."
"15672704","articletitle","Correlation of serum total IgE, eosinophil granule cationic proteins, sensitized allergens and family aggregation in atopic dermatitis patients with or without rhinitis."
"15672704","abstracttext","Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease with both a genetic background and environmental interactions. Although multiple linkage-analyses about AD have been studied, there have been only a few family aggregation tests of AD or perennial allergic rhinitis (AR) to date. The association of allergen-specific IgE in AD and atopic dermatitis with allergic perennial rhinitis (ADR) have also been seldom discussed. The purpose of this study was to evaluate family aggregation and assess allergen-specific IgE in patients with AD and ADR. We also planned to investigate the effect of family history of AD on the prevalence of allergen-specific antibodies. The serum levels of IgE, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and major basic protein (MBP) were measured and compared in patients with AD and those with ADR. Proportional analysis compared allergen-specific IgE between AD and ADR. The family aggregation was conducted to estimate the odds ratio for various atopic diseases in different family members. Total IgE and allergen-specific antibodies in serum were compared between those patients who had AD with AR and those without. The result revealed that allergic rhinitis is the most common concomitant atopic disease associated with AD. The ADR group was more likely to have serum mite-, cockroach-, and feather-specific IgE. The positive rates for wheat, peanut and soybean were higher in those AD without rhinitis. In the family aggregation of AD, the odds ratio for siblings was higher than for parents, the ratios for brother and sister were 9.91 and 8.75, respectively. However, the odds ratio for parents of ADR was higher than siblings; the ratios for father and mother of ADR were 8.22 and 2.94, respectively. AD patients with family histories of AD were more likely to have mite-, soybean-, and peanut-specific antibodies in their serum. We concluded that aeroallergens are the most important allergens aggravating atopic diseases in Taiwan. Food plays an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Measurement of serum total IgE combined with the MAST-CLA test could be helpful in the diagnosis of atopic diseases. The differential aggregation tendency for AD and ADR implicated the complexity of the gene-environment interaction in these atopic diseases."
"12432926","articletitle","Plant and fungal lipoxygenases."
"12432926","abstracttext","Lipoxygenases (LOX) are ubiquitous in plants, and some are important for resistance to pathogens. The soybean LOX (SLOX) remain the prototypes for studying lipoxygenation. The 3-D structures of SLOX-1 and -3 reveal an N-terminal beta-barrel and a C-terminal catalytic domain. The beta-barrel with 30 kDa of the N-terminal peptide chain of SLOX-1 can be separated from the catalytic domain (60 kDa), which is a functional lipoxygenase designated ""mini-LOX."" The 3-D structures have made it possible to predict and interpret effects of point mutations on catalytic parameters and on the substrate and position specificity and to identify the catalytic base as Fe3+-OH-. The first catalytic step, hydrogen abstraction at C-11 of linoleic acid by Fe3+-OH-, is associated with a very large isotope effect (20-80), which can be explained by the quantum-mechanical concept of hydrogen tunneling ""through a 2-D potential barrier."" The prosthetic iron of SLOX-3 can be extracted and the apoenzyme can incorporate Fe3+ and regain LOX activity. Plant LOX can be elicited by fungal pathogens. One fungal LOX has been cloned and characterized. It is secreted by the take-all fungus, and the enzyme may contribute to its detrimental actions on wheat roots. The primary structure of Mn-LOX shows that it belongs to the LOX gene family, the metal ligands appear to be homologous, and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra suggest redox cycling between Mn2+ and Mn3+. The hypothetical catalytic base, Mn3+-OH-, abstracts the pro-S hydrogen at C-11, and molecular oxygen is inserted in a suprafacial way at C-11 and -13 in a 1:3 ratio. Mn-LOX catalyses the conversion of the 11S-hydroperoxide to 13R-hydroperoxylinoleic acid. Mn-LOX is a novel tool for studying lipoxygenation and plant-fungal interactions."
"12450833","articletitle","Impact of protozoan grazing on bacterial community structure in soil microcosms."
"12450833","abstracttext","The influence of grazing by a mixed assemblage of soil protozoa (seven flagellates and one amoeba) on bacterial community structure was studied in soil microcosms amended with a particulate resource (sterile wheat roots) or a soluble resource (a solution of various organic compounds). Sterilized soil was reinoculated with mixed soil bacteria (obtained by filtering and dilution) or with bacteria and protozoa. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR amplifications of 16S rRNA gene fragments, as well as community level physiological profiling (Biolog plates), suggested that the mixed protozoan community had significant effects on the bacterial community structure. Excising and sequencing of bands from the DGGE gels indicated that high-G+C gram-positive bacteria closely related to Arthrobacter spp. were favored by grazing, whereas the excised bands that decreased in intensity were related to gram-negative bacteria. The percentages of intensity found in bands related to high G+C gram positives increased from 4.5 and 12.6% in the ungrazed microcosms amended with roots and nutrient solution, respectively, to 19.3 and 32.9% in the grazed microcosms. Protozoa reduced the average bacterial cell size in microcosms amended with nutrient solution but not in the treatment amended with roots. Hence, size-selective feeding may explain some but not all of the changes in bacterial community structure. Five different protozoan isolates (Acanthamoeba sp., two species of Cercomonas, Thaumatomonas sp., and Spumella sp.) had different effects on the bacterial communities. This suggests that the composition of protozoan communities is important for the effect of protozoan grazing on bacterial communities."
"12391304","articletitle","Transneuronal tracing of diverse CNS circuits by Cre-mediated induction of wheat germ agglutinin in transgenic mice."
"12391304","abstracttext","Systems neuroscience addresses the complex circuits made by populations of neurons in the CNS and the cooperative function of these neurons. Improved approaches to the neuroanatomical analysis of CNS circuits are thus of great interest. In fact, significant advances in tract-tracing methods have recently been made by using transgenic mice that express transneuronal lectin tracers under the control of neuron-specific promoters. The utility of those animals, however, is limited to the CNS circuit influenced by the particular promoter. Here, we describe a new transgenic mouse that can be used for transneuronal tracing analysis of circuits in any region of the brain or spinal cord. The transgene in these mice results in expression of LacZ in neurons throughout the CNS. Excision of the LacZ gene by Cre-mediated recombination initiates expression of the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). To illustrate the diverse uses of these ZW (LacZ-WGA) mice, we triggered WGA expression either by crossing the mice with two Cre-expressing transgenic mouse lines or by microinjecting a Cre-expressing adeno-associated virus into the cerebellum or cerebral cortex. Both approaches resulted in extensive WGA expression in the cell bodies and dendrites of neurons in which the recombination event occurred, as well as anterograde and transneuronal transport of the lectin to second and third order neurons. Because the lectin can be induced in developing and adult animals, and in all regions of the brain and spinal cord, these ZW may prove extremely valuable for numerous studies of CNS circuit analysis."

"12595997","abstracttext","Plant cytochrome P450s are known to be essential in a number of economically important pathways of plant metabolism but there are also many P450s of unknown function accumulating in expressed sequence tag (EST) and genomic databases. To detect trait associations that could assist in the assignment of gene function and provide markers for breeders selecting for commercially important traits, detection of polymorphisms in identified P450 genes is desirable. Polymorphisms in EST sequences provide so-called perfect markers for the associated genes. The International Triticeae EST Cooperative data base of 24,344 ESTs was searched for sequences exhibiting homology to P450 genes representing the nine known clans of plant P450s. Seventy five P450 ESTs were identified of which 24 had best matches in Genbank to P450 genes of known function and 51 to P450s of unknown function. Sequence information from PCR products amplified from the genomic template DNA of 11 barley varieties was obtained using primers designed from six barley P450 ESTs and one durum wheat P450 EST. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between barley varieties were identified using five of the seven PCR products. A maximum of five SNPs and three haplotypes among the 11 barley lines were detected in products from any one primer pair. SNPs in three PCR products led to changes between barley varieties in at least one restriction site enabling genotyping and mapping without the expense of a specialist SNP detection system. The overall frequency of SNPs across the 11 barley varieties was 1 every 131 bases."

"12582611","abstracttext","Cochliobolus sativus is a plant pathogenic fungus that causes spot blotch on barley and wheat. Virulence of a pathotype-2 isolate (ND90Pr) on barley cultivar Bowman was previously determined to be controlled by a single locus. To identify DNA markers associated with this virulence locus, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis was conducted on 104 progeny isolates derived from a cross between isolates ND90Pr (exhibiting high virulence on Bowman) and ND93-1 (exhibiting low virulence on Bowman). Among 115 AFLP markers identified, 14 were linked to the virulence locus VHv1 in isolate ND90Pr, six of which co-segregated with VHv1. Two (E-AG/M-CA-207 and E-AG/M-CG-121) of the six co-segregating AFLP markers were cloned and used to probe genomic DNAs from the fungal parents and progeny. Both markers hybridized only with DNAs from ND90Pr and the virulent progeny. These two cloned markers were also used as probes to survey field isolates of C. sativus collected from different regions of the world and again only hybridized to DNAs from isolates that had the same virulence phenotype as ND90Pr. The results of this study indicate that E-AG/M-CA-207 and E-AG/M-CG-121 are closely linked to VHv1 and are unique to isolates carrying the virulence locus. Development of a linkage group, coupled with the identification of closely linked molecular markers, will facilitate the cloning of the virulence gene VHv1 in C. sativus by map-based cloning."

"12702023","abstracttext","The Hong Mang Mai wheat cultivar is tolerant to deep-sowing conditions because it has an elongated first internode that is sensitive to gibberellin (GA3). The cells in the GA-treated first internodes were approximately 4.2 mm long, twice as long as the untreated Hong Mang Mai first internode cells. The elongation of the first internode of Hong Mang Mai, particularly when treated with GA3, was accompanied by remarkable spiral growth. In contrast, the first internodes of the GA-insensitive cultivar Norin 10 did not exhibit GA3-induced elongation or spiral growth. The walls of the first internode cells of GA3-treated Hong Mang Mai seedlings showed increased extensibility and higher (1-->3), (1-->4)-beta-d-glucanase activity, autolysis and glucan contents than the cell walls of untreated Hong Mang Mai first internodes. The changes in the cell wall extensibility due to GA3 treatment correlated strongly with the GA3-induced changes in cell wall glucan content, autolysis, and glucanase activity. GA3-treated Hong Mang Mai seedlings showed elevated expression of Glucanase EI gene in the first internode compared to GA3-treated Norin 10. Thus, GA aids first internode elongation in Hong Mang Mai by enhancing glucan turnover and thus increasing cell wall loosening. The spiral growth of the first internode also helps the plant elongate against soil resistance, thereby promoting the deep-sowing tolerance of this cultivar."

"12909714","abstracttext","Phytochelatin synthases (PCS) mediate cellular heavy-metal resistance in plants, fungi, and worms. However, phytochelatins (PCs) are generally considered to function as intracellular heavy-metal detoxification mechanisms, and whether long-distance transport of PCs occurs during heavy-metal detoxification remains unknown. Here, wheat TaPCS1 cDNA expression was either targeted to Arabidopsis roots with the Arabidopsis alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh) promoter (Adh::TaPCS1/cad1-3) or ectopically expressed with the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (35S::TaPCS1/cad1-3) in the PC-deficient mutant cad1-3. Adh::TaPCS1/cad1-3 and 35S::TaPCS1/cad1-3 complemented the cadmium, mercury, and arsenic sensitivities of the cad1-3 mutant. Northern blot, RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses showed Adh promoter-driven TaPCS1 expression only in roots and thus demonstrated lack of long-distance TaPCS1 mRNA and protein transport in plants. Fluorescence HPLC analyses showed that under Cd2+ stress, no PCs were detectable in cad1-3. However, in Adh::TaPCS1/cad1-3 plants, PCs were detected in roots and in rosette leaves and stems. Inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometer analyses showed that either root-specific or ectopic expression of TaPCS1 significantly enhanced long-distance Cd2+ transport into stems and rosette leaves. Unexpectedly, transgenic expression of TaPCS1 reduced Cd2+ accumulation in roots compared with cad1-3. The reduced Cd2+ accumulation in roots and enhanced root-to-shoot Cd2+ transport in transgenic plants were abrogated by l-buthionine sulfoximine. The presented findings show that (i) transgenic expression of TaPCS1 suppresses the heavy-metal sensitivity of cad1-3, (ii) PCs can be transported from roots to shoots, and (iii) transgenic expression of the TaPCS1 gene increases long-distance root-to-shoot Cd2+ transport and reduces Cd2+ accumulation in roots."

"15831767","abstracttext","Mice, with the variety of genotypes they provide, should be particularly useful for studies of growth factors and gene products in regeneration of autonomic pathways such as the vagus nerve. To provide a foundation for examinations of mouse vagal reorganization, two experiments assessed the rate, extent, and accuracy of afferent reinnervation of the stomach after vagotomy and related these patterns to feeding behavior. In experiment 1, the pattern of afferent regrowth into the gut after unilateral truncal vagotomy was characterized by labeling of these afferents with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase and Micro-Ruby. Regenerating neurites had reached and, in some cases, already reinnervated the stomach by 4 wk after axotomy. By 8 wk, regrowth was more extensive, and many fibers had redifferentiated terminals in the smooth muscle. By 16 wk, vagal projections had reached or exceeded normal density in the corpus, density in the forestomach was still reduced, and regrowth in the antrum was minimal. At all time points, not only appropriate terminals, but also growth cones and aberrant endings, were observed. In experiment 2, meal patterns of vagotomized mice were evaluated using a solid diet over the period of regeneration; cholecystokinin suppression of a liquid meal after unilateral and bilateral truncal vagotomies was also evaluated. Unilaterally, as well as bilaterally, vagotomized animals ate smaller and more frequent meals. These disturbed patterns became more pronounced in the first 8 wk after vagotomy, during regeneration. Cholecystokinin inhibition of intake was attenuated by bilateral, but not unilateral, vagotomy. Overall, the spatial and temporal patterns of structural and functional changes observed during regeneration verify that the mouse provides a useful preparation for examining the control of vagal plasticity."

"15700421","abstracttext","Six full-length gene transcripts ZmNHX1-6 from Zea mays L. that were homologous to tonoplast-associated Na+/H+ antiporter were identified. The deduced transcripts code 538-545 amino acids and share a high homology with those of putative tonoplast-associated Na+/H+ antiporters of higher plants, ranging from 78% homology with that of Arabidopsis thaliana (AtNHX1) to 63% with that of tomato (LeNHX1). On the other hand, the homology of the identified transcripts with those of plasma membrane or mitochondrial membrane-associated Na+/H+ antiporters was low. An amiloride-binding site in transmembrane domain M4 was predicted. The phylogenetic analysis grouped the six isoforms into two groups. ZmNHX1,2,6 form one group together with Arabidopsis AtNHX1,2, rice OsNHX and wheat TaNHX2. The second group, ZmNHX3-5, clusters with Arabidopsis AtNHX4-6 and tomato LeNHX2. The expression of ZmNHX isoforms at the mRNA Level showed an organ and salt-specific pattern. In addition, a genotype-specific expression pattern of the ZmNHX isoforms was detected. One genotype was a maize inbred line with high Na+ exclusion at the root surface and the level of xylem parenchyma. For the root tissue of this inbred line, a linear response of ZmNHX to NaCl concentrations in root medium ranging from 1 to 100 mM was detected using real-time PCR. Conversely, there was no salt response of ZmNHX for the shoot of the same plant. No salt response of ZmNHX was detected for maize F1 hybrid Pioneer 3906 with moderate Na+ exclusion. The relationship of the expression of ZmNHX with salt resistance of maize is discussed."

"15910327","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), a clonal basidiomycete causing yellow rust disease on wheat, has a long record of 'overcoming' cultivar resistance introduced by breeders. Despite the long dispersal capacity of its spores, the French population of PST presents a strong geographical structure, with the presence of a specific pathotype (array of avirulence genes) at high frequencies in the south of France. The genetic diversity underlying this differentiation was analysed by microsatellite and AFLP markers. A total of 213 French isolates belonging to 10 pathotypes collected over a 15-year period were investigated. For each of the 12 microsatellites used, polymorphism resulted from a unique allelic variant associated to the south-specific pathotype. This pathotype was characterized by 40 specific markers over the total of 63 polymorphins detected using 15 AFLP primer combinations. Phylogeographical analysis indicated a strictly clonal structure of the population, and a strong genomic divergence between the northern population and a south-specific clone. Both virulence and molecular data show that the northern French population belongs to the northwestern European population, whereas the southern clone is most likely related to a Mediterranean population, the two subpopulations resulting from the ancient divergence of two clonal lineages. While the virulence complexity in the northern population may be explained by the successive introduction of corresponding resistance genes in cultivars, the maintenance of a simple virulence type in southern France, despite gene flow between the two populations, may be explained in terms of host cultivars repartition and local adaptation to specific host or climatic conditions."

"14499435","abstracttext","Abnormal or excessive activity related to pain and injury in early life may alter normal synaptic development and lead to changes in somatosensory processing. The aim of the current study was to define the critical factors that determine long-term plasticity in spinal cord afferent terminals following neonatal inflammation. Hindpaw inflammation was produced in neonatal rat pups with 5 or 25 microl 2% carrageenan, and 5 or 25 microl complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). All groups displayed a clear inflammatory response that recovered in 2 weeks in all but the 25 microl CFA group, who had persistent chronic inflammation confirmed by histological examination of the paw at 8 weeks. The 25 microl CFA group was also the only group that displayed a significant expansion of the sciatic and saphenous nerve terminal field in lamina II of the dorsal horn at 8 weeks, using wheat-germ agglutinin-horse radish peroxidase transganglionic labelling. This effect was not accompanied by changes in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cell number, expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3), or alterations in calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) or isolectin B4 binding; and was not mimicked by partial nerve damage. No long-term change in mechanical or thermal behavioural sensory thresholds was seen in any group. Lower dose CFA caused an acute, reversible expansion of terminal fields in lamina II in neonatal animals, while CFA did not produce this effect in adults. The duration and effect of neonatal inflammation is therefore dependent on the type and volume of inflammatory agent used. The expansion of afferent terminals in lamina II following neonatal CFA inflammation is maintained into adulthood if the inflammation is also maintained, as seen following 25 microl CFA. This effect is not seen in adult animals, emphasising the plasticity of the nervous system early in development."

"14499994","abstracttext","In situ assays, based on monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), were developed to study the microbial expression of the bacterial dissimilatory copper-containing nitrite reductase gene (DnirK), one of the key enzymes involved in denitrification, in different ecosystems. With a combination of an anti-DnirK mAb and phylogenetic oligonucleotide probes, it is possible to bring structural and functional aspects of microbial communities together. To perform a double labelling, yielding a high signal strength for both the oligonucleotide and the antibody, cells have to be labelled with the oligonucleotide first followed by immunostaining. When the labelling sequence was changed, the accessibility for the oligonucleotide was reduced if high amounts of DnirK were expressed. Using flow cytometry, it was possible to sort bacterial cells, which were stained by the antibody, from nonlabelled cells. This technique provides means for a detailed analysis of populations, which express DnirK genes in the environment, including structural aspects of a community and detailed promoter studies. Using the immunostaining approach, it was possible to identify bacteria, which have the DnirK system expressed, in samples from a wastewater sewage treatment plant as well as in samples from the rhizosphere of wheat roots. Furthermore, expression studies using an Ochrobactrum anthropi strain were carried out to investigate the correlation between N(2)O production rates and DnirK expression in batch cultures, which had been shifted from aerobic to anaerobic conditions. As expected, expression of DnirK was the highest during periods with the greatest synthesis rates for N(2)O. However, the amount of expressed enzyme was not reduced in the cells, although the N(2)O production rates dropped in the cultures 12 h after the shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions."

"14699092","abstracttext","A protein designated ABAP1 and encoded by a novel gene (GenBank accession number AF127388) was purified and shown to specifically bind abscisic acid (ABA). ABAP1 protein is a 472-amino acid polypeptide containing a WW protein interaction domain and is induced by ABA in barley aleurone layers. Polyclonal antiidiotypic antibodies (AB2) cross-reacted with purified ABAP1 and with a corresponding 52-kDa protein associated with membrane fractions of ABA-treated barley aleurones. ABAP1 genes were detected in diverse monocot and dicot species, including wheat, tobacco, alfalfa, garden pea, and oilseed rape. The recombinant ABAP1 protein optimally bound (3)H-(+)-ABA at neutral pH. Denatured ABAP1 protein did not bind (3)H-(+)-ABA, nor did bovine serum albumin. The maximum specific binding as shown by Scatchard plot analysis was 0.8 mol of ABA mol(-1) protein with a linear function of r(2) = 0.94, an indication of one ABA-binding site with a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 28 x 10(-9) m. ABA binding in aleurone plasma membranes showed a maximum binding capacity of 330 nmol of ABA g(-1) protein with a K(d) of 26.5 x 10(-9) m. The similarities in the dissociation constants for ABA binding of the recombinant protein and that of the plasma membranes suggest that the protein within the plasma membrane fraction is the native form of ABAP1. The stereospecificity of ABAP1 was established by the incapability of ABA analogs and metabolites, including (-)-ABA, trans-ABA, phaseic acid, dihydrophaseic acid, and (+)-abscisic acid-glucose ester, to displace (3)H-(+)-ABA bound to ABAP1. However, two ABA precursors, (+)-ABA aldehyde and (+)-ABA alcohol, were able to displace (3)H-(+)-ABA, an indication that the structural requirement of ABAP1 at the C-1 position is not strict. Our data show that ABAP1 exerts high binding affinity for ABA. The interaction is reversible, follows saturation kinetics, and has stereospecificity, thus meeting the criteria for an ABA-binding protein."

"14585982","abstracttext","Idefix is a long terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposon present in Drosophila melanogaster which shares similarities with vertebrates retroviruses both in its genomic arrangement and in the mechanism of transposition. Like in retroviruses, its two LTRs flank a long 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) and three open reading frames referred to as the gag, pol, and env genes. Here we report that its 5'UTR, located upstream of the gag gene, can fold into highly structured domains that are known to be incompatible with efficient translation by ribosome scanning. Using dicistronic plasmids analyzed by both (i) in vitro transcription and translation in rabbit reticulocyte or wheat germ lysates and (ii) in vivo expression in transgenic flies, we show that the 5'UTR of Idefix exhibits an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) activity that is able to promote translation of a downstream cistron in a cap-independent manner. The functional state of this novel IRES depends on eukaryotic factors that are independent of their host origin. However, in vivo, its function can be down-regulated by trans-acting factors specific to tissues or developmental stages of its host. We identify one of these trans-acting factors as the Gag protein encoded by Idefix itself. Our data support a model in which nascent Gag is able to block translation initiated from the viral mRNA and thus its own translation. These data highlight the fact that LTR-retrotransposons may autoregulate their replication cycle through their Gag production."

"14504243","abstracttext","We report a genetic recombination map for Sorghum of 2512 loci spaced at average 0.4 cM ( approximately 300 kb) intervals based on 2050 RFLP probes, including 865 heterologous probes that foster comparative genomics of Saccharum (sugarcane), Zea (maize), Oryza (rice), Pennisetum (millet, buffelgrass), the Triticeae (wheat, barley, oat, rye), and Arabidopsis. Mapped loci identify 61.5% of the recombination events in this progeny set and reveal strong positive crossover interference acting across intervals of </=50 cM. Significant variations in DNA marker density are related to possible centromeric regions and to probable chromosome structural rearrangements between Sorghum bicolor and S. propinquum, but not to variation in levels of intraspecific allelic richness. While cDNA and genomic clones are similarly distributed across the genome, SSR-containing clones show different abundance patterns. Rapidly evolving hypomethylated DNA may contribute to intraspecific genomic differentiation. Nonrandom distribution patterns of multiple loci detected by 357 probes suggest ancient chromosomal duplication followed by extensive rearrangement and gene loss. Exemplifying the value of these data for comparative genomics, we support and extend prior findings regarding maize-sorghum synteny-in particular, 45% of comparative loci fall outside the inferred colinear/syntenic regions, suggesting that many small rearrangements have occurred since maize-sorghum divergence. These genetically anchored sequence-tagged sites will foster many structural, functional and evolutionary genomic studies in major food, feed, and biomass crops."

"14600793","abstracttext","Three laccases, a natural form and two recombinant forms obtained from two different expression hosts, were characterized and compared for paper pulp bleaching. Laccase from Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, a well known lignolytic fungus, was selected as a reference for this study. The corresponding recombinant laccases were produced in Aspergillus oryzae and A. niger hosts using the lacI gene from P. cinnabarinus to develop a production process without using the expensive laccase inducers required by the native source. In flasks, production of recombinant enzymes by Aspergilli strains gave yields close to 80 mg l(-1). Each protein was purified to homogeneity and characterized, demonstrating that the three hosts produced proteins with similar physico-chemical properties, including electron paramagnetic resonance spectra and N-terminal sequences. However, the recombinant laccases have higher Michaelian (Km) constants, suggesting a decrease in substrate/enzyme affinity in comparison with the natural enzyme. Moreover, the natural laccase exhibited a higher redox potential (around 810 mV), compared with A. niger (760 mV) and A. oryzae (735 mV). Treatment of wheat straw Kraft pulp using laccases expressed in P. cinnabarinus or A. niger with 1-hydroxybenzotriazole as redox mediator achieved a delignification close to 75%, whereas the recombinant laccase from A. oryzae was not able to delignify pulp. These results were confirmed by thioacidolysis. Kinetic and redox potential data and pulp bleaching results were consistent, suggesting that the three enzymes are different and each fungal strain introduces differences during protein processing (folding and/or glycosylation)."

The latter strains formed both opaque and translucent colonies, designated as phase I and phase II, respectively. It appeared that important biocontrol traits, such as motility and the production of antifungal metabolites, proteases, lipases, chitinases, and biosurfactants, are correlated with phase I morphology and are absent in bacteria with phase II morphology. From a Tn5luxAB transposon library of Pseudomonas sp. strain PCL1171 phase I cells, two mutants exhibiting stable expression of phase II had insertions in gacS. A third mutant, which showed an increased colony phase variation frequency was mutated in mutS. Inoculation of wheat seeds with PCL1171 bacteria of phase I morphology resulted in efficient suppression of take-all disease, whereas disease suppression was absent with phase II bacteria. Neither the gacS nor the mutS mutant was able to suppress take-all, but biocontrol activity was restored after genetic complementation of these mutants. Furthermore, in a number of cases, complementation by gacS of wild-type phase II sectors to phase I phenotype could be shown. A PCL1171 phase I mutant defective in antagonistic activity appeared to have a mutation in a gene encoding a lipopeptide synthetase homologue and had lost its biocontrol activity, suggesting that biocontrol by strain PCL1171 is dependent on the production of a lipopeptide. Our results show that colony phase variation plays a regulatory role in biocontrol by Pseudomonas bacteria by influencing the expression of major biocontrol traits and that the gacS and mutS genes play a role in the colony phase variation process. Therefore phase variation not only plays a role in escaping animal defense but it also appears to play a much broader and vital role in the ecology of bacteria producing exoenzymes, antibiotics, and other secondary metabolites."
"14627199","articletitle","Antigenic peptides complexed to phylogenically diverse Hsp70s induce differential immune responses."
"14627199","abstracttext","The Hsp70 class of heat shock proteins (Hsps) has been implicated at multiple points in the immune response, including initiation of proinflammatory cytokine production, antigen recognition and processing, and phenotypic maturation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This class of chaperones is highly conserved in both sequence and structure, from prokaryotes to higher eukaryotes. In all cases, these chaperones function to bind short segments of either peptides or proteins through an adenosine triphosphate-dependent process. In addition to a possible role in antigen presentation, these chaperones have also been proposed to function as a potent adjuvant. We compared 4 evolutionary diverse Hsp70s, E. coli DnaK, wheat cytosolic Hsc70, plant chloroplastic CCS1, and human Hsp70, for their ability to prime and augment a primary immune response against herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1). We discovered that all 4 Hsp70s were highly effective as adjuvants displaying similar ability to lipopolysaccharides in upregulating cytokine gene expression. In addition, they were all capable of inducing phenotypic maturation of APCs, as measured by the display of various costimulatory molecules. However, only the human Hsp70 was able to mediate sufficient cross-priming activity to afford a protective immune response to HSV1, as judged by protection from a lethal viral challenge, in vitro proliferation, cytotoxicity, and intracellular interferon-gamma production. The difference in immune response generated by the various Hsp70s could possibly be due to their differential ability to interact productively with other coreceptors and different regulatory cochaperones."

"14629361","abstracttext","Collembola comprise a major source of alternative prey to linyphiid spiders in arable fields, helping to sustain and retain these predators as aphid control agents within the crop. Polymerase chain reaction primers were developed for the amplification, from spider gut samples, of DNA from three of the most abundant species of Collembola in wheat crops in Europe, namely Isotoma anglicana, Lepidocyrtus cyaneus and Entomobrya multifasciata. The primers amplified fragments of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and were designed following alignment of comparable sequences for a range of predator and prey species. Each of the primer pairs proved to be species-specific to a Collembola species, amplifying DNA fragments from 211 to 276 base pairs in length. Following consumption of a single collembolan, prey DNA was detectable in 100% of spiders after 24 h of digestion. We report the first use of DNA-based techniques to detect predation by arthropods on natural populations of prey in the field. All three species of Collembola were consumed by the spiders. By comparing the ratios of the Collembola species in the field with the numbers of spiders that gave positive results for each of those species, it was possible to demonstrate that the spiders were exercising prey choice. Overall, a single target species of Collembola was eaten by 48% of spiders while a further 16% of spiders contained DNA from two different species of Collembola. Preference was particularly evident for I. anglicana, the species most frequently found in spider guts yet the least numerous of the three target species in the field."
"15342528","articletitle","Comparative mapping of a major aluminum tolerance gene in sorghum and other species in the poaceae."
"15342528","abstracttext","In several crop species within the Triticeae tribe of the grass family Poaceae, single major aluminum (Al) tolerance genes have been identified that effectively mitigate Al toxicity, a major abiotic constraint to crop production on acidic soils. However, the trait is quantitatively inherited in species within other tribes, and the possible ancestral relationships between major Al tolerance genes and QTL in the grasses remain unresolved. To help establish these relationships, we conducted a molecular genetic analysis of Al tolerance in sorghum and integrated our findings with those from previous studies performed in crop species belonging to different grass tribes. A single locus, AltSB, was found to control Al tolerance in two highly Al tolerant sorghum cultivars. Significant macrosynteny between sorghum and the Triticeae was observed for molecular markers closely linked to putatively orthologous Al tolerance loci present in the group 4 chromosomes of wheat, barley, and rye. However, AltSB was not located within the homeologous region of sorghum but rather mapped near the end of sorghum chromosome 3. Thus, AltSB not only is the first major Al tolerance gene mapped in a grass species that does not belong to the Triticeae, but also appears to be different from the major Al tolerance locus in the Triticeae. Intertribe map comparisons suggest that a major Al tolerance QTL on rice chromosome 1 is likely to be orthologous to AltSB, whereas another rice QTL on chromosome 3 is likely to correspond to the Triticeae group 4 Al tolerance locus. Therefore, this study demonstrates a clear evolutionary link between genes and QTL encoding the same trait in distantly related species within a single plant family."
"15020809","articletitle","MITE display."
"15020809","abstracttext","Genome size differences among crop plants are largely due to unequal accumulation of repetitive DNA sequences, mainly transposable elements (TEs). Over the past decade, many families of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) have been identified and characterized in a variety of organisms including animals and plants. MITEs are characterized by short terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) (10-15 bp), small size (approx 100 to 500 bp), high-copy-number (approx 1000 to 15,000 per haploid genome), and a preference for insertion into 2-bp to 3-bp targets that are rich in A and T residues. In this chapter, we present a modified transposon display procedure based on the maize MITE family Heartbreaker (Hbr). This technique is similar to AFLP in which AFLP adaptors are ligated to compatible ends of digested genomic DNA. Subsets of Hbr-containing fragments are then amplified using one AFLP primer and another primer complementary to an internal sequence of the Hbr element. Like AFLP, the Hbr display method permits the simultaneous analysis of numerous DNA fragments. Given the plethora of available marker systems, the major advantage of Hbr markers, and perhaps most MITE-based markers, is a preference for insertion in or near transcriptionally active genomic regions. This feature may be especially valuable in the large genomes of agriculturally important plants like maize, wheat, and barley where gene-rich islands are thought to exist in a sea of retrotransposons. Having a class of markers that are enriched in genic regions, coupled with the ease of isolating MITE markers, could expedite chromosome walks and map-based cloning protocols in these organisms."
"15032881","articletitle","Sugar and fructan accumulation during metabolic adjustment between respiration and fermentation under low oxygen conditions in wheat roots."
"15032881","abstracttext","In terms of gene expression and carbohydrate metabolism, the response of wheat seedlings to hypoxia is dramatically different from the anoxic response. Total carbohydrate content of roots increased 4-fold during 6 days of hypoxia, with a 17-fold increase in fructans. In contrast, anoxically treated roots depleted all soluble carbohydrates and died within 72 h. Gas exchange measurements (CO(2) release vs. O(2) uptake) demonstrate that hypoxia establishes a new balance between fermentation and aerobic respiration in the roots without altering the flux of carbon through glycolysis. Furthermore, the respiratory component of this new balance is 55% higher in roots that have been hypoxically pretreated compared to non-hypoxically pretreated roots. The establishment of this new homeostasis under hypoxia involves the induction of glycolytic (aldolase and enolase) and fermentative enzymes (pyruvate decarboxylase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and lactate dehydrogenase). Enzyme induction is generally complete within 24 h with mRNA induction occurring primarily during Period I (0-6 h of hypoxia), and maximal enzymes activities attained during Period II (6-24 h of hypoxia). Accumulation rates of Suc, hexoses, and fructans also change during Periods I and II. By the start of Period III (24-144 h of hypoxia), the metabolic adjustments are complete and fructans are the major carbohydrate accumulated. In anoxia, the pattern of enzyme induction was dramatically different: aldolase was not induced and declined throughout the treatment. Alcohol dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase, and lactate dehydrogenase were induced as in hypoxia, but rapidly declined within 72 h of anoxia. Only enolase exhibited a similar expression pattern in both anoxia and hypoxia."

"15006774","abstracttext","Wet wheat distillers' grain (WWDG), a residue from ethanol fermentation, was examined from a microbiological perspective. After storage, WWDG was characterized by a high content of lactobacilli, nondetectable levels of other bacteria, occasional occurrence of yeasts, and a pH of about 3.6 and contained a mixture of lactic acid, acetic acid, and ethanol. The composition of lactobacilli in WWDG was simple, including primarily the species Lactobacillus amylolyticus, Lactobacillus panis, and Lactobacillus pontis, as determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Since the use of WWDG as pig feed has indicated a health-promoting function, some relevant characteristics of three strains of each of these species were examined together with basal physiological parameters, such as carbohydrate utilization and growth temperature. Seven of the strains were isolated from WWDG, and two strains from pig feces were included for comparison. It was clear that all three species could grow at temperatures of 45 to 50 degrees C, with L. amylolyticus being able to grow at temperatures as high as 54 degrees C. This finding could be the explanation for the simple microflora of WWDG, where a low pH together with a high temperature during storage would select for these organisms. Some strains of L. panis and L. pontis showed prolonged survival at pH 2.5 in synthetic stomach juice and good growth in the presence of porcine bile salt. In addition, members of all three species were able to bind to immobilized mucus material in vitro. Especially the isolates from pig feces but, interestingly, some isolates from WWDG as well possessed properties that might be of importance for colonization of the gastrointestinal tracts of pigs."
"15213130","articletitle","Functional analysis of the Streptococcus gordonii DL1 sialic acid-binding adhesin and its essential role in bacterial binding to platelets."
"15213130","abstracttext","Bacterial recognition of host sialic acid-containing receptors plays an important role in microbial colonization of the human oral cavity. The sialic acid-binding adhesin of Streptococcus gordonii DL1 was previously associated with the hsa gene encoding a 203-kDa protein. The predicted protein sequence consists of an N-terminal nonrepetitive region (NR1), including a signal sequence, a relatively short serine-rich region (SR1), a second nonrepetitive region (NR2), a long serine-rich region (SR2) containing 113 dodecapeptide repeats, and a C-terminal cell wall anchoring domain. In the present study, the contributions of SR1, NR2, and SR2 to Hsa-mediated adhesion were assessed by genetic complementation. Adhesion of an hsa chromosomal deletion mutant to sialic acid-containing receptors was restored by plasmids containing hsa constructs encoding Hsa that lacked either the N- or C-terminal portion of SR2. In contrast, hsa constructs that lacked the coding sequences for SR1, NR2, or the entire SR2 region failed to restore adhesion. Surface expression of recombinant Hsa was not affected by removal of SR1, NR2, or a portion of SR2 but was greatly reduced by complete removal of SR2. Wheat germ agglutinin, a probe for Hsa-specific glycosylation, reacted with recombinant Hsa lacking SR1, NR2, or SR2 but not with recombinant Hsa lacking both SR1 and SR2. Significantly, the aggregation of human platelets by S. gordonii DL1, an interaction implicated in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis, required the expression of hsa. Moreover, neuraminidase treatment of the platelets eliminated this interaction, further supporting the hypothesis that Hsa plays an essential role in the bacterium-platelet interaction."
"16728270","articletitle","Celiac disease--sandwiched between innate and adaptive immunity."
"16728270","abstracttext","Celiac disease (CD) patients are intolerant to gluten, proteins in wheat, and related cereals. Virtually all patients are human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 positive and several studies have demonstrated that CD4 T cells specific for (modified) gluten peptides bound to these HLA-DQ molecules are found in patients but not in control subjects. These T cell responses are therefore thought to be responsible for disease development. Many immunogenic gluten peptides which may relate to the disease-inducing properties of gluten have now been identified. In addition, gluten can stimulate IL-15 production that ultimately leads to NKG2D-mediated epithelial cell killing. However, CD develops in only a minority of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 individuals. This may be attributed to the default setting of the intestinal immune system: induction and maintenance of tolerance to dietary components and commensal flora. Although at present it is unknown why tolerance in CD is not established or broken, both environmental and genetic factors have been implicated. There is strong evidence for the existence of genes or gene variants on chromosomes 5, 6, and 19 that predispose to CD. In addition, type I interferons have been implicated in development of several autoimmune disorders, including CD. Thus, viral infection and/or tissue damage in the intestine may cause inflammation and induce protective Th1-mediated immunity leading to loss of tolerance for gluten. Once tolerance is broken, a broad gluten-reactive T cell repertoire may develop through determinant spreading. This may be a critical step toward full-blown disease."
"16564640","articletitle","Transient receptor potential vanilloid 1-immunopositive neurons in the mouse are more prevalent within colon afferents compared to skin and muscle afferents."
"16564640","abstracttext","Previous studies in our laboratories found that isolectin B(4)(IB(4))-positive polymodal nociceptors in the mouse do not express transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1), nor does deletion of TRPV1 compromise the ability of these afferents to detect thermal stimuli. Considering that IB(4)-positive afferents account for over 70% of cutaneous nociceptors and that 30-50% of all mouse primary afferents express TRPV1, it is highly likely that many TRPV1-positive fibers project to non-cutaneous structures. To investigate this issue, Alexa Fluor-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) or IB(4) was injected into the nerves innervating quadriceps muscle (femoral) or hindlimb skin (saphenous) of male C57Bl/6 mice. Similarly, Alexa Fluor-conjugated cholera toxin-beta was injected subserosally into the distal colon. Spinal ganglia at the appropriate level (L2-3 for saphenous and femoral nerves; L6 for colon) were processed for TRPV1, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), neurofilament heavy chain (NHF) and IB(4) visualization and examined on a confocal microscope. Colon afferents contained the highest percentage of both TRPV1- and CGRP-positive neurons, followed by femoral (WGA) and saphenous afferents (WGA and IB(4)). In contrast, NHF staining was more prevalent among femoral afferents, followed by saphenous (WGA) and colon afferents. IB(4) binding was observed in very few colon or saphenous (WGA) afferents, with no femoral afferents binding or transporting IB(4). Considering that the largest percentages of TRPV1-positive neurons observed in this study were within visceral and muscle afferent populations (neurons that typically are not subject to noxious temperatures), these results suggest that TRPV1 may not function primarily as a temperature sensor but rather as a detector of protons, vanilloid compounds or through interactions with other membrane proteins."

"16788067","abstracttext","In Escherichia coli, a family of cold shock proteins (CSPs) function as transcription antiterminators or translational enhancers at low temperature by destabilizing RNA secondary structure. A wheat nucleic acid-binding protein (WCSP1) was found to contain a cold shock domain (CSD) bearing high similarity to E. coli cold shock proteins. In the present study, a series of mutations were introduced into WCSP1, and its functionality was investigated by using in vivo and in vitro assays in the context of functional conservation with E. coli CSPs. Constitutive expression of WT WCSP1 in an E. coli cspA, cspB, cspE, cspG quadruple deletion mutant complemented its cold-sensitive phenotype, suggesting that WCSP1 shares a function with E. coli CSPs for cold adaptation. In addition, transcription antitermination activity was demonstrated for WCSP1 by using an E. coli strain that has a hairpin loop upstream of a chloramphenicol resistance gene. In vitro dsDNA melting assays clearly demonstrated that WCSP1 melts dsDNA, an activity that was positively correlated to the ability to bind ssDNA. When mutations were introduced at critical residues within the consensus RNA binding motifs (RNP1 and RNP2) of WCSP1, it failed to melt dsDNA. Studies with WCSP1-GFP fusion proteins documented patterns that are consistent with ER and nuclear localization. In vivo and in vitro functional analyses, coupled with subcellular localization data, suggest that WCSP1 may function as a RNA chaperone to destabilize secondary structure and is involved in the regulation of translation under low temperature."

"16805735","abstracttext","Although the moss Physcomitrella patens is known to respond to abscisic acid (ABA) by activating gene expression, the transcriptional components involved have not been characterized. Initially, we used the ABA-responsive Em promoter from wheat linked to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) to determine whether ABI3/VP1, transcriptional regulators in the ABA-signaling pathway in angiosperms, were similarly active in the ABA response of P. patens. We show by particle bombardment that ABI3 and VP1 affect Em-GUS expression in P. patens in a manner similar to angiosperms. We also show the involvement of ABI1 in the pathway, utilizing the abi1-1 mutant allele. We isolated three ABI3-like genes from P. patens. Using an Em-like ABA-responsive promoter from P. patens (PpLea1), we demonstrate that PpABI3A, only in the presence of ABA, strongly enhances PpLea1-GUS expression in P. patens. PpABI3A also enhances ABA-induced Em-GUS expression in P. patens. In barley aleurone, PpABI3A transactivates Em-GUS but to a lesser extent than VP1 and ABI3. PpABI3A:GFP is localized to the nucleus of both protonemal cells and barley aleurone, indicating that the nuclear localization signals are conserved. We show that at least a part of the inability of PpABI3A to fully complement the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis abi3-6 mutant is due to a weak interaction between PpABI3A and the bZIP transcription factor ABI5, as assayed functionally in barley aleurone and physically in the yeast-two-hybrid assay. Our data clearly demonstrate that P. patens will be useful for comparative structural and functional studies of components in the ABA-response pathway such as ABI3."

"16232900","abstracttext","A cell-free translation/glycosylation system derived from lepidopteran (Sf21) cells, which are widely used to express high yields of foreign active proteins that have post-translational modifications, was constructed. The insect cell extract was prepared using a Mini-Bomb cell disruption chamber by nitrogen pressure treatment, which stably retains translational and post-translational components. The gp120 mRNA was transcribed from the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 gene with T7 RNA polymerase. When the gp120 mRNA was translated in the insect cell-free system, gp120 having a molecular mass of 100 kDa was detected by Western blot analysis. Synthesized gp120 and gp120 expressed in the intracellular fraction of recombinant-baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells had the same molecular mass, and they both had reduced mobility compared with gp120 secreted by recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf21 cells. In contrast, the 56-kDa gp120 protein, which corresponds to the polypeptide backbone of gp120, was synthesized in wheat germ and rabbit reticulocyte systems. The molecular mass of synthesized gp120 decreased from 100 kDa to 61 kDa after endoglycosidase H treatment, indicating that synthesized gp120 had been glycosylated with N-linked oligosaccharides. Furthermore, glycosylated gp120 was bound to human CD4 molecules expressed on the surface of quail cells. These results revealed that the insect cell-free system can synthesize gp120 that is folded in the proper conformation to provide a CD4-binding domain."

"16650004","abstracttext","The major cationic peroxidase in sorghum grain (SPC4) , which is ubiquitously present in all sorghum varieties was purified to apparent homogeneity, and found to be a highly basic protein (pI approximately 11). MS analysis showed that SPC4 consists of two glycoforms with molecular masses of 34,227 and 35,629 Da and it contains a type-b heme. Chemical deglycosylation allowed to estimate sugar contents of 3.0% and 6.7% (w/w) in glycoform I and II, respectively, and a mass of the apoprotein of 33,246 Da. High performance anion exchange chromatography allowed to determine the carbohydrate constituents of the polysaccharide chains. The N-terminal sequence of SPC4 is not blocked by pyroglutamate. MS analysis showed that six peptides, including the N-terminal sequence of SPC4 matched with the predicted tryptic peptides of gene indice TC102191 of sorghum chromosome 1, indicating that TC102191 codes for the N-terminal part of the sequence of SPC4, including a signal peptide of 31 amino acids. The N-terminal fragment of SPC4 (213 amino acids) has a high sequence identity with barley BP1 (85%), rice Prx23 (90%), wheat WSP1 (82%) and maize peroxidase (58%), indicative for a common ancestor. SPC4 is activated by calcium ions. Ca2+ binding increased the protein conformational stability by raising the melting temperature (Tm) from 67 to 82 degrees C. SPC4 catalyzed the oxidation of a wide range of aromatic substrates, being catalytically more efficient with hydroxycinnamates than with tyrosine derivatives. In spite of the conserved active sites, SPC4 differs from BP1 in being active with aromatic compounds above pH 5."

Sourdoughs were prepared either from flours of the cereals wheat, rye, oat, barley, rice, maize, and millet, or from the pseudocereals amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat, or from cassava, using a starter consisting of various species of LAB and yeasts. Doughs were propagated until a stable microbiota was established. The dominant LAB and yeast species were Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus pontis, Lactobacillus spicheri, Issatchenkia orientalis and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The proportion of the species within the microbiota varied. L. paralimentarius dominated in the pseudocereal sourdoughs, L. fermentum, L. plantarum and L. spicheri in the cassava sourdough, and L. fermentum, L. helveticus and L. pontis in the cereal sourdoughs. S. cerevisiae constituted the dominating yeast, except for quinoa sourdough, where I. orientalis also reached similar counts, and buckwheat and oat sourdoughs, where no yeasts could be detected. To assess the usefulness of competitive LAB and yeasts as starters, the fermentations were repeated using flours from rice, maize, millet and the pseudocereals, and by starting the dough fermentation with selected dominant strains. At the end of fermentation, most of starter strains belonged to the dominating microbiota. For the rice, millet and quinoa sourdoughs the species composition was similar to that of the prior fermentation, whereas in the other sourdoughs, the composition differed."

"19028992","abstracttext","The C-9-methylated glucosylceramides (GlcCers) are sphingolipids unique to fungi. They play important roles in fungal growth and pathogenesis, and they act as receptors for some antifungal plant defensins. We have identified two genes, FgMT1 and FgMT2, that each encode a putative sphingolipid C-9 methyltransferase (C-9-MT) in the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum and complement a Pichia pastoris C-9-MT-null mutant. The DeltaFgmt1 mutant produced C-9-methylated GlcCer like the wild-type strain, PH-1, whereas the DeltaFgmt2 mutant produced 65 to 75% nonmethylated and 25 to 35% methylated GlcCer. No DeltaFgmt1DeltaFgmt2 double-knockout mutant producing only nonmethylated GlcCer could be recovered, suggesting that perhaps C-9-MTs are essential in this pathogen. This is in contrast to the nonessential nature of this enzyme in the unicellular fungus P. pastoris. The DeltaFgmt2 mutant exhibited severe growth defects and produced abnormal conidia, while the DeltaFgmt1 mutant grew like the wild-type strain, PH-1, under the conditions tested. The DeltaFgmt2 mutant also exhibited drastically reduced disease symptoms in wheat and much-delayed disease symptoms in Arabidopsis thaliana. Surprisingly, the DeltaFgmt2 mutant was less virulent on different host plants tested than the previously characterized DeltaFggcs1 mutant, which lacks GlcCer synthase activity and produces no GlcCer at all. Moreover, the DeltaFgmt1 and DeltaFgmt2 mutants, as well as the P. pastoris strain in which the C-9-MT gene was deleted, retained sensitivity to the antifungal plant defensins MsDef1 and RsAFP2, indicating that the C-9 methyl group is not a critical structural feature of the GlcCer receptor required for the antifungal action of plant defensins."

"18944294","abstracttext","Lysobacter enzymogenes C3 is a bacterial biological control agent that exhibits antagonism against multiple fungal pathogens. Its antifungal activity was attributed in part to lytic enzymes. In this study, a heat-stable antifungal factor (HSAF), an antibiotic complex consisting of dihydromaltophilin and structurally related macrocyclic lactams, was found to be responsible for antagonism by C3 against fungi and oomycetes in culture. HSAF in purified form exhibited inhibitory activity against a wide range of fungal and oomycetes species in vitro, inhibiting spore germination, and disrupting hyphal polarity in sensitive fungi. When applied to tall fescue leaves as a partially-purified extract, HSAF at 25 mug/ml and higher inhibited germination of conidia of Bipolaris sorokiniana compared with the control. Although application of HSAF at 12.5 mug/ml did not reduce the incidence of conidial germination, it inhibited appressorium formation and suppressed Bipolaris leaf spot development. Two mutant strains of C3 (K19 and DeltaNRPS) that were disrupted in different domains in the hybrid polyketide synthase-nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene for HSAF biosynthesis and had lost the ability to produce HSAF were compared with the wild-type strain for biological control efficacy against Bipolaris leaf spot on tall fescue and Fusarium head blight, caused by Fusarium graminearum, on wheat. Both mutant strains exhibited decreased capacity to reduce the incidence and severity of Bipolaris leaf spot compared with C3. In contrast, the mutant strains were as efficacious as the wild-type strain in reducing the severity of Fusarium head blight. Thus, HSAF appears to be a mechanism for biological control by strain C3 against some, but not all, plant pathogenic fungi."

Spore germination was nonsynchronous and all spore stages including germination were observed 5 to 21 dfs. Initial host perception of pathogen invasion, based on autofluorescence in epidermal cells adjacent to the appressoria, was similar in both compatible and incompatible interactions, and occurred as early as 5 to 6 dfs. The total number of sites on a 1-cm segment of coleoptile adjacent to the seed that exhibited autofluorescence was similar in both the compatible and incompatible interactions and rose to a maximum of 35 to 40 per 1 cm length of coleoptile following 17 dfs, although new infection events were observed as late as 21 dfs. In the compatible interaction, the autofluorescence became more diffuse 10 to 12 dfs, emanating in all directions in association with fungal spread. In the incompatible interaction, autofluorescence remained restricted to a small area surrounding the penetration site. Two different reaction zones that extended further in tissues surrounding the penetration point in the incompatible interaction compared with the compatible interaction were identified. The accumulation of callose around invading fungal hyphae was observed during both the compatible and incompatible interactions from 8 to 21 dfs. While callose accumulation was more extensive and widespread in the incompatible interaction, it was clearly present in compatible interactions, particularly in treatments involving BW553. These results were confirmed by expression of callose synthase transcripts that were more abundant in BW553 than in Neepawa and were upregulated during pathogen infection in both compatible and incompatible interactions."

Urediniospore morphology and early symptom development have limited usefulness for distinguishing Puccinia spp. Therefore, we developed real-time polymerase chain reaction assays for rapid detection of the four rust pathogen species, Puccinia graminis (Pers.:Pers.), P. striiformis (Westend.), P. triticina (Eriks.), and P. recondita (Roberge ex Desmaz.). Duplex assays were constructed for the nuclear rDNA gene, using the variable internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region to distinguish between species, and the conserved 28S region as an internal control. Species-specific ITS1 primer/probe sets were highly specific and could detect <1 pg of DNA. The species-specific primer/probe sets showed positive results over a linear range of DNA five orders of magnitude or greater. Specificity of the assays was tested using multiple collections representing a range of races and formae speciales within a species. Additionally, assay specificity was evaluated by testing a range of other grass rust pathogens, as well as other fungi. The 28S primer/probe combination was successful in detecting all Puccinia spp. tested within the duplex assays, validating the integrity of each assay. Finally, the assays were used to identify unknown rust fungi infecting pasture grasses."

We identified loci associated with pathogenicity and aggressiveness on an amplified fragment length polymorphism based genetic map of G. zeae in a cross between a lineage 6 nivalenol producer from Japan and a lineage 7 deoxynivalenol producer from Kansas. Ninety-nine progeny and the parents were tested in the greenhouse for 2 years. Progeny segregated qualitatively (61:38) for pathogenicity:nonpathogenicity, respectively. The trait maps to linkage group IV, which is adjacent to loci that affect colony pigmentation, perithecium production, and trichothecene toxin amount. Among the 61 pathogenic progeny, the amount of disease induced (aggressiveness) varied quantitatively. Two reproducible quantitative trait loci (QTL) for aggressiveness were detected on linkage group I using simple interval analysis. A QTL linked to the TRI5 locus (trichodiene synthase in the trichothecene pathway gene cluster) explained 51% of the variation observed, and a second QTL that was 50 centimorgans away explained 29% of the phenotypic variation. TRI5 is tightly linked to the locus controlling trichothecene toxin type. The two QTLs, however, were likely part of the same QTL using composite interval analysis. Progeny that produced deoxynivalenol were, on average, approximately twice as aggressive as those that produced nivalenol. No transgressive segregation for aggressiveness was detected. The rather simple inheritance of both traits in this interlineage cross suggests that relatively few loci for pathogenicity or aggressiveness differ between lineage 6 and 7."

"19415310","abstracttext","Autopsy findings of a patient, with sialidosis type I phenotype carrying V217M/G243R mutations in the lysosomal sialidase gene and biochemically defined isolated sialidase deficiency, who died of intractable lymphoma at the age of 32 years, are described. Perikaryal expansion of cytoplasm was evident, mostly in motor neurons (in the anterior horn and the brain stem), dorsal root ganglia, cerebellar dentate neurons and some neurons in the thalamus and nucleus basalis of Meynert. The stored material was lamellar in lysosomes and exhibited a specific affinity to wheat germ agglutinin at light and electron microscopy, which indicates the accumulation of terminal sialic acid at the non-reducing end of the sugar chain in this pathological structure. Neuronal loss in these nuclei, however, was not frequent in spite of frequent and massive cytoplasmic expansion. Neocortex exhibited a mild spongiosis with some swelling of neurons, which contained lipofuscin-like granules and small amount of lamellar structures in lysosomes. This contrast suggests a discrepancy between the storage process and vulnerability of neurons, both variable according to areas examined. In the cerebellar vermis, dysplastic features, such as abnormal layering of Purkinje cells, thinning and rarefaction of the granule cell layer, incomplete formation of synapse and disordered proliferation of Bergmann's glia, were focally accentuated, suggesting some developmental abnormality not secondary to the storage process. This is the first autopsy demonstration of sialic acid in the lamellar materials and of a developmental abnormality in isolated sialidase deficiency. Additional studies are needed to clarify how this molecular abnormality leads to these morphological and clinical manifestations."
"17301062","articletitle","Comparative analysis of sequences preceding protein-coding mitochondrial genes in flowering plants."
"17301062","abstracttext","We examined the nucleotide sequences preceding 23 mitochondrial protein-coding genes held in common by maize, rice, wheat, sugar beet, tobacco, Arabidopsis, and Brassica to look for features related to translation initiation and to assess the degree of conservation in mitochondrial mRNA leaders among these plants. We observed broad variation in sequence similarity as illustrated by dot plot analysis, ranging from a level rivaling that of coding sequences to complete absence of homology due to lineage-specific DNA rearrangements. Genes encoding ATP synthase subunits predominated in the latter category, whereas ones encoding cytochrome c biogenesis proteins and NADH dehydrogenase subunits were primarily of the highly conserved type. Within the region immediately preceding initiation codons, in most cases we did not observe motifs consistent with a bacterial-type Shine-Dalgarno interaction to assist in ribosome binding, nor was any other consensus sequence evident. In fact, indels in the form of tandem repeats were seen among homologues from different plants. We did, however, observe a bias for high adenosine and low cytosine in the proximal approximately 30 nt compared with further upstream. Duplicates of some sequences in our data set were found to be associated with more than one gene within a genome. Indeed, 3 such families of upstream cassettes were identified, and they exhibit a lineage-specific distribution among plants. Moreover, the presence of related sequences at genomic sites distant from known genes raises the possibility of future recruitment as regulatory elements. Our observations point to a dynamic nature in the makeup of the 5' leaders of plant mitochondrial mRNAs and an apparent plasticity in translational control elements."
"17156092","articletitle","Increased serotonergic innervation of lumbosacral motoneurons of rolling mouse Nagoya in correlation with abnormal hindlimb extension."
"17156092","abstracttext","Rolling Mouse Nagoya (RMN) carries a mutation in a gene encoding for alpha(1A) subunit of P/Q-type Ca(2+) channel (Ca(v)2.1). In addition to ataxia, this mutant mouse exhibits abnormal hindlimb extension, which is characterized by a sustained excessive tone of hindlimb extensor muscles. This study aimed to clarify whether serotonergic (5-HTergic) innervation of the spinal motoneurons was altered in RMN in relation to the abnormal hindlimb extension. The density of 5-HT immunoreactive fibres in the ventral horn of lumbar and sacral regions of spinal cord was significantly greater in RMN than in controls. Retrograde wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) labelling combined with 5-HT immunostaining revealed that the number of 5-HT immunoreactive terminals adjoining femoris quadriceps motoneurons was about 2.5-fold greater in RMN than in controls. Furthermore, 5-HT immunostaining in the lumbar cord ventral horn was examined in three other Ca(v)2.1 mutant mice (tottering, leaner and pogo) as to whether or not they showed the abnormal hindlimb extension. Among these mutants, the increased density of 5-HT immunoreactive fibres was observed in correlation with the presence of the abnormal hindlimb extension. The results suggest an increased 5-HTergic innervation of the lumbosacral motoneurons in correlation with the abnormal hindlimb extension in RMN and other Ca(v)2.1 mutant mice. As 5-HT is known to induce the sustained membrane depolarizations without continuous excitatory synaptic inputs (plateau potentials) in spinal motoneurons, the increased 5-HTergic innervation may cause the sustained excitation of hindlimb extensor motoneurons, resulting in the abnormal hindlimb extension."

"17217471","abstracttext","Phosphomannomutase (PMM) catalyzes the interconversion of mannose-6-phosphate and mannose-1-phosphate. However, systematic molecular and functional investigations on PMM from higher plants have hitherto not been reported. In this work, PMM cDNAs were isolated from Arabidopsis, Nicotiana benthamiana, soybean, tomato, rice and wheat. Amino acid sequence comparisons indicated that plant PMM proteins exhibited significant identity to their fungal and mammalian orthologs. In line with the similarity in primary structure, plant PMM complemented the sec53-6 temperature sensitive mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Histidine-tagged Arabidopsis PMM (AtPMM) purified from Escherichia coli converted mannose-1-phosphate into mannose-6-phosphate and glucose-1-phosphate into glucose-6-phosphate, with the former reaction being more efficient than the latter one. In Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana, PMM was constitutively expressed in both vegetative and reproductive organs. Reducing the PMM expression level through virus-induced gene silencing caused a substantial decrease in ascorbic acid (AsA) content in N. benthamiana leaves. Conversely, raising the PMM expression level in N. benthamiana using viral-vector-mediated ectopic expression led to a 20-50% increase in AsA content. Consistent with this finding, transgenic expression of an AtPMM-GFP fusion protein in Arabidopsis also increased AsA content by 25-33%. Collectively, this study improves our understanding on the molecular and functional properties of plant PMM and provides genetic evidence on the involvement of PMM in the biosynthesis of AsA in Arabidopsis and N. benthamiana plants."
"17147609","articletitle","Efficient cloning of plant genomes into bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries with larger and more uniform insert size."
"17147609","abstracttext","The construction of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries remains relatively complex and laborious, such that any technological improvement is considered to be highly advantageous. In this study, we addressed several aspects that improved the quality and efficiency of cloning of plant genomes into BACs. We set the 'single tube vector' preparation method with no precipitation or gel electrophoresis steps, which resulted in less vector DNA damage and a remarkable two- to threefold higher transformation efficiency compared with other known vector preparation methods. We used a reduced amount of DNA for partial digestion (up to 5 microg), which resulted in less BAC clones with small inserts. We performed electrophoresis in 0.25 x TBE (Tris, boric acid, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) buffer instead of 0.5 x TBE, which resulted in larger and more uniformly sized BAC inserts and, surprisingly, a two- to threefold higher transformation efficiency, probably due to less contamination with borate ions. We adopted a triple size selection that resulted in an increased mean insert size of up to 70 kb and a transformation efficiency comparable with that of double size selection. Overall, the improved protocol presented in this study resulted in a five- to sixfold higher cloning efficiency and larger and more uniformly sized BAC inserts. BAC libraries with the desired mean insert size (up to 200 kb) were constructed from several plant species, including hexaploid wheat. The improved protocol will render the construction of BAC libraries more available in plants and will greatly enhance genome analysis, gene mapping and cloning."

"17512686","abstracttext","The microbiota of ten seeds and ready-to-eat sprouts produced thereof was characterized by bacteriological culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of amplified DNA fragments of the 16S rRNA gene. The predominant bacterial biota of hydroponically grown sprouts mainly consisted of enterobacteria, pseudomonades and lactic acid bacteria (LAB). For adzuki, alfalfa, mung bean, radish, sesame and wheat, the ratio of these bacterial groups changed strongly in the course of germination, whereas for broccoli, red cabbage, rye and green pea the ratio remained unchanged. Within the pseudomonades, Pseudomonas gesardii and Pseudomonas putida have been isolated and strains of the potentially pathogenic species Enterobacter cancerogenes and Pantoea agglomerans were found as part of the main microbiota on hydroponically grown sprouts. In addition to the microbiota of the whole seedlings, the microbiota of root, hypocotyl and seed leafs were examined for alfalfa, radish and mung bean sprouts. The highest and lowest total counts for aerobic bacteria were found on seed leafs and hypocotyls, respectively. On the other hand, the highest numbers for LAB on sprouts were found on the hypocotyl. When sprouting occurred under the agricultural conditions, e.g. in soil, the dominating microbiota changed from enterobacteria to pseudomonades for mung beans and alfalfa sprouts. No pathogenic enterobacteria have been isolated from these sprout types. Within the pseudomonades group, Pseudomonas jessenii and Pseudomonas brassicacearum were found as dominating species on all seedling parts from soil samples. In practical experiments, a strain of P. jessenii was found to exhibit a potential for use as protective culture, as it suppresses the growth of pathogenic enterobacteria on ready-to-eat sprouts."
"16990615","articletitle","Induced trefoil factor family 1 expression by trans-differentiating Clara cells in a murine asthma model."
"16990615","abstracttext","Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that is accompanied by goblet cell metaplasia and mucus hypersecretion. Trefoil factor family (TFF) peptides represent major secretory products of the respiratory tract and are synthesized together with mucins. In the murine lung, TFF2 is mainly expressed, whereas TFF1 transcripts represent only a minor species. TFF peptides are well known for their motogenic and anti-apoptotic effects, and they modulate the inflammatory response of bronchial epithelial cells. Here, an established mouse model of asthma was investigated (i.e., exposure to Aspergillus fumigatus [AF] antigens). RT-PCR analysis of lung tissue showed elevated levels particularly of TFF1 transcripts in AF-sensitized/challenged animals. In contrast, transcripts encoding Clara cell secretory protein (CCSP/CC10) were strongly diminished in these animals. For comparison, the expression of the goblet cell secretory granule marker mCLCA3/Gob-5, the mucins Muc1-Muc6 and Muc19, and the secretoglobins ScgB3A1 and ScgB3A2, as well as the mammalian ependymin-related gene MERP2, were monitored. Immunohistochemistry localized TFF1 mainly in cells with a mixed phenotype (e.g., TFF1-positive cells stain with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), which recognizes mucins characteristic of goblet cells). In addition, these cells express CCSP/CC10, a Clara cell marker. When compared with mucins or CCSP/CC10, TFF1 was stored in a different population of secretory granules localized at the more basolateral portion of these cells. Thus, the results presented indicate for the first time that allergen exposure leads to the trans-differentiation of Clara cells toward a TFF1-expressing mucous phenotype."
"16915522","articletitle","A novel cis-acting element, ESP, contributes to high-level endosperm-specific expression in an oat globulin promoter."
"16915522","abstracttext","To examine the genetic controls of endosperm (ES) specificity, several cereal seed storage protein (SSP) promoters were isolated and studied using a transient expression analysis system. An oat globulin promoter (AsGlo1) capable of driving strong ES-specific expression in barley and wheat was identified. Progressive 5' deletions and cis element mutations demonstrated that the mechanism of specificity in the AsGlo1 promoter was distinct from that observed in glutelin and prolamin promoters. A novel interrupted palindromic sequence, ACATGTCATCATGT, was required for ES specificity and substantially contributed to expression strength of the AsGlo1 promoter. This sequence was termed the endosperm specificity palindrome (ESP) element. The GCN4 element, which has previously been shown to be required for ES specificity in cereal SSP promoters, had a quantitative role but was not required for tissue specificity. The 960-bp AsGlo1 promoter and a 251-bp deletion containing the ESP element also drove ES-specific expression in stably transformed barley. Reporter gene protein accumulated at very high levels (10% of total soluble protein) in ES tissues of plants transformed with an AsGlo1:GFP construct. Expression strength and tissue specificity were maintained over five transgenic generations. These attributes make the AsGlo1 promoter an ideal promoter for biotechnology applications. In conjunction with previous findings, our data demonstrate that there is more than one genetically distinct mechanism by which ES specificity can be achieved in cereal SSP promoters, and also suggest that there is redundancy between transcriptional and post-transcriptional tissue specificity mechanisms in cereal globulin genes."
"17485545","articletitle","Identification of long intergenic region sequences involved in maize streak virus replication."
"17485545","abstracttext","The main cis-acting control regions for replication of the single-stranded DNA genome of maize streak virus (MSV) are believed to reside within an approximately 310 nt long intergenic region (LIR). However, neither the minimum LIR sequence required nor the sequence determinants of replication specificity have been determined experimentally. There are iterated sequences, or iterons, both within the conserved inverted-repeat sequences with the potential to form a stem-loop structure at the origin of virion-strand replication, and upstream of the rep gene TATA box (the rep-proximal iteron or RPI). Based on experimental analyses of similar iterons in viruses from other geminivirus genera and their proximity to known Rep-binding sites in the distantly related mastrevirus wheat dwarf virus, it has been hypothesized that the iterons may be Rep-binding and/or -recognition sequences. Here, a series of LIR deletion mutants was used to define the upper bounds of the LIR sequence required for replication. After identifying MSV strains and distinct mastreviruses with incompatible replication-specificity determinants (RSDs), LIR chimaeras were used to map the primary MSV RSD to a 67 nt sequence containing the RPI. Although the results generally support the prevailing hypothesis that MSV iterons are functional analogues of those found in other geminivirus genera, it is demonstrated that neither the inverted-repeat nor RPI sequences are absolute determinants of replication specificity. Moreover, widely divergent mastreviruses can trans-replicate one another. These results also suggest that sequences in the 67 nt region surrounding the RPI interact in a sequence-specific manner with those of the inverted repeat."

"17456505","abstracttext","Fructans, which are beta-(2,1) and/or beta-(2,6) linked polymers of fructose, are important storage carbohydrates in many plants. They are mobilized via fructan exohydrolases (FEHs). The cloning, mapping, and functional analysis of the first 1-FEH (EC 3.2.1.153) from Lolium perenne L. var. Bravo is described here. By screening a perennial ryegrass cDNA library, a 1-FEH cDNA named Lp1-FEHa was cloned. The Lp1-FEHa deduced protein has a low iso-electric point (5.22) and it groups together with plant FEHs and cell-wall type invertases. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 75% identity to wheat 1-FEH w2. The Lp1-FEHa gene was mapped at a distal position on the linkage group 3 (LG3). Functional characterization of the recombinant protein in Pichia pastoris demonstrated that it had high FEH activity towards 1-kestotriose, 1,1-kestotetraose, and inulin, but low activity against 6-kestotriose and levan. Like other fructan-plant FEHs, no hydrolase activity could be detected towards sucrose, convincingly demonstrating that the enzyme is not a classic invertase. The expression pattern analysis of Lp1-FEHa revealed transcript accumulation in leaf tissues accumulating fructans while transcript level was low in the photosynthetic tissues. The high expression level of this 1-FEH in conditions of active fructan synthesis, together with its low expression level when fructan contents are low, suggest that it might play a role as a beta-(2,1) trimming enzyme acting during fructan synthesis in concert with fructan synthesis enzymes."

Potato is the most important staple food for mankind after the cereals rice, wheat and maize, and is extremely poor in provitamin A carotenoids."
"17406674","abstracttext_methodology","We transformed potato with a mini-pathway of bacterial origin, driving the synthesis of beta-carotene (Provitamin A) from geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Three genes, encoding phytoene synthase (CrtB), phytoene desaturase (CrtI) and lycopene beta-cyclase (CrtY) from Erwinia, under tuber-specific or constitutive promoter control, were used. 86 independent transgenic lines, containing six different promoter/gene combinations, were produced and analyzed. Extensive regulatory effects on the expression of endogenous genes for carotenoid biosynthesis are observed in transgenic lines. Constitutive expression of the CrtY and/or CrtI genes interferes with the establishment of transgenosis and with the accumulation of leaf carotenoids. Expression of all three genes, under tuber-specific promoter control, results in tubers with a deep yellow (""golden"") phenotype without any adverse leaf phenotypes. In these tubers, carotenoids increase approx. 20-fold, to 114 mcg/g dry weight and beta-carotene 3600-fold, to 47 mcg/g dry weight."

"18223110","abstracttext","The diversity of populations of yeast and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in pig feeds fermented at 10, 15, or 20 degrees C was characterized by rRNA gene sequencing of isolates. The feeds consisted of a cereal grain mix blended with wet wheat distillers' grains (WWDG feed), whey (W feed), or tap water (WAT feed). Fermentation proceeded for 5 days without disturbance, followed by 14 days of daily simulated feed outtakes, in which 80% of the contents were replaced with fresh feed mixtures. In WWDG feed, Pichia galeiformis became the dominant yeast species, independent of the fermentation temperature and feed change. The LAB population was dominated by Pediococcus pentosaceus at the start of the fermentation period. After 3 days, the Lactobacillus plantarum population started to increase in feeds at all temperatures. The diversity of LAB increased after the addition of fresh feed components. In W feed, Kluyveromyces marxianus dominated, but after the feed change, the population diversity increased. With increasing fermentation temperatures, there was a shift toward Pichia membranifaciens as the dominant species. L. plantarum was the most prevalent LAB in W feed. The WAT feed had a diverse microbial flora, and the yeast population changed throughout the whole fermentation period. Pichia anomala was the most prevalent yeast species, with increasing occurrence at higher fermentation temperatures. Pediococcus pentosaceus was the most prevalent LAB, but after the feed change, L. plantarum started to proliferate. The present study demonstrates that the species composition in fermented pig feed may vary considerably, even if viable cell counts indicate stable microbial populations."
"17728298","articletitle","A novel ERF transcription activator in wheat and its induction kinetics after pathogen and hormone treatments."
"17728298","abstracttext","In this study, a pathogen-inducible ERF (ethylene-response factor) gene in wheat, designated TaERF3, was isolated and characterized in detail. The sequence of the TaERF3 protein possesses all of the traits commonly associated with ERFs, but its entire sequence shares low identity with other ERFs of transcription factor families. The results of assays on subcelluar localization, GCC box-binding ability, and transactivation activity indicated that TaERF3 is a nuclear targeting protein and functions as a GCC box-binding transcriptional activator. Following infection with Blumeria graminis, the induction peak of TaERF3 expression occurring at 12 h in the resistant line was about six times higher than that in its susceptible parent. Following infections with Fusarium graminearum or Rhizoctonia cerealis, the TaERF3 maximum inductions in the susceptible line occurring at 12 h were about three or six times higher than those in the resistant lines, whereas after 24 h or 48 h, the transcript inductions in the resistant lines were much higher than that in the susceptible line. Furthermore, the TaERF3 transcript peak induced by salicylic acid (SA) treatment occurred at 4 h, whereas the peaks induced by exogenous ethylene and methyl jasmonate (MeJA) occurred at 24 h, all of which were earlier than those induced by pathogens in the resistant lines. These results suggested that TaERF3 might be mainly involved in the active defence response to B. graminis at an earlier stage through SA signalling, and to F. graminearum and R. cerealis at a later stage through the ethylene/jasmonic acid signalling pathways."

"17933935","abstracttext","Bacteria from crops of 1- and 5-week-old broiler chickens fed with two brands (diets A and B) of wheat-based diets were isolated on Lactobacillus-selective medium and identified (n = 300) based on partial 16S rRNA gene sequence. The most abundant Lactobacillus species were L. reuteri (33%), L. crispatus (18.7%), and L. salivarius (13.3%). Regardless of farm and feed, L. reuteri was the most abundant species (P < 0.005) in the crops of the younger chickens. However, the amount of L. reuteri was significantly reduced in the crops of the 5-week-old chickens regardless of the feed (P = 0.016). The diversity of L. reuteri isolates was studied by fatty acid analysis, and the 94 L. reuteri isolates could be arranged into several clusters. The nisin sensitivities of the L. reuteri isolates were determined because nisin is a candidate coccidiostat. Sensitive isolates were found more frequently in younger chickens (77%) than in 5-week-old chickens (23%), whereas chickens fed with commercial feed B had a higher proportion of nisin-resistant isolates (73%) than did chickens fed with feed A (45%). Nisin-resistant strains are potential candidates for adjunct cultures for maintaining L. reuteri in its natural niche in the crop and are potential targets for genetic engineering with nisin-selectable food-grade vectors. The diversity of the L. reuteri population suggested that one should consider including several strains representing different clusters and nisin resistance phenotypes in candidate probiotic feed supplements for chickens."

"17899563","abstracttext","The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is an important industrial microorganism. Nowadays, it is being used as a cell factory for the production of pharmaceuticals such as insulin, although this yeast has long been utilized in the bakery to raise dough, and in the production of alcoholic beverages, fermenting the sugars derived from rice, wheat, barley, corn and grape juice. S. cerevisiae has also been extensively used as a model eukaryotic system. In the last decade, genomic techniques have revealed important features of its molecular biology. For example, DNA array technologies are routinely used for determining gene expression levels in cells under different physiological conditions or environmental stimuli. Laboratory strains of S. cerevisiae are different from wine strains. For instance, laboratory yeasts are unable to completely transform all the sugar in the grape must into ethanol under winemaking conditions. In fact, standard culture conditions are usually very different from winemaking conditions, where multiple stresses occur simultaneously and sequentially throughout the fermentation. The response of wine yeasts to these stimuli differs in some aspects from laboratory strains, as suggested by the increasing number of studies in functional genomics being conducted on wine strains. In this paper we review the most recent applications of post-genomic techniques to understand yeast physiology in the wine industry. We also report recent advances in wine yeast strain improvement and propose a reference framework for integration of genomic information, bioinformatic tools and molecular biology techniques for cellular and metabolic engineering. Finally, we discuss the current state and future perspectives for using 'modern' biotechnology in the wine industry."

"17991996","abstracttext","Germination of imbibed embryos is the initial stage of plant development that is accompanied by the burst of mitochondrial respiration. To understand the process of mitochondrial biogenesis during this critical stage in wheat development, we monitored changes in mitochondrial transcript profiles during the first 3 days by adopting a newly devised macroarray system. The whole experiment was conducted in the dark to avoid influences of photosynthesis. Dry quiescent embryos started respiration rapidly after imbibition and the rate of oxygen uptake increased to peak at the first day followed by a continuous decrease until the third day under this condition. Both the cytochrome and alternative electron transport pathways appeared to contribute to this initial burst. Shoot and root growth was also remarkable during this period. Mitochondrial transcriptome was studied by macroarray analysis using 28 mitochondrial protein-coding genes, 4 nuclear encoded mitochondria-targeted genes and 2 nuclear genes as control. All transcripts were present in dry embryos at different initial levels, and a large variability was observed in their abundance among individual genes throughout the tested period. Gene expression was categorized into four clusters according to the profiles of individual transcript accumulation. A majority of the genes encoding subunits of the respiratory complexes belonged to two major clusters, the time course of transcript accumulation of one cluster agreeing with that of respiratory development and the other remaining at high constant levels. The macroarray system devised in this study should be useful in monitoring mitochondrial biogenesis under various growth conditions and at different developmental stages in cereals."

"17995733","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize a strain of Aspergillus capable of producing xylanase. According to the morphology and comparison of ITS (Internal Transcribed Spacer) rDNA gene sequence, the strain Aspergillus sp. ZH-26 was identified as a strain of Aspergillus awamori. Statistically based experimental designs were applied for the optimization of xylanase production from A. awamori ZH-26. The considered medium components included 17 components as follows: yeast extract, tryptone, urea, NH(4)Cl, (NH(4))(2)SO(4), NaNO(3), KH(2)PO(4), K(2)HPO(4), NH(4)NO(3), MgSO(4), CaCl(2), CuSO(4), ZnCl(2), FeSO(4), MnSO(4), vitamin B(1), and EDTA. Yeast extract, tryptone, (NH(4))(2)SO(4), KH(2)PO(4), and CaCl(2) were identified to have significant effects on xylanase production using the Plackett-Burman experimental design. These 5 major components were subsequently optimized using the Box-Behnken experimental design. By response surface methodology and canonical analysis, the optimal concentrations for higher production of xylanase were yeast extract 5.95 g/L, tryptone 6.79 g/L, (NH(4))(2)SO(4) 13.37 g/L, KH(2)PO(4) 1.14 g/L, CaCl(2) 0.81 g/L. Under optimal conditions, the xylanase activity from A. awamori ZH-26 reached 47.3 U/mL. A small-scale mashing was carried out to evaluate the performance of the xylanase on degradation of arabinoxylans in mashing. Results showed that polymeric arabinoxylan content and wort viscosity in mashing with grist containing wheat malt sharply decreased to the basal level (from 470 to 185 mg/L) with the addition of xylanase."

"17976886","abstracttext","Caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) catalyzes the multi-step methylation reactions of hydroxylated monomeric lignin precursors, and is believed to occupy a pivotal position in the lignin biosynthetic pathway. A cDNA (TaCM) was identified from wheat and it was found to be expressed constitutively in stem, leaf and root tissues. The deduced amino acid sequence of TaCM showed a high degree of identity with COMT from other plants, particularly in SAM binding motif and the residues responsible for catalytic and substrate specificity. The predicted TaCM three-dimensional structure is very similar with a COMT from alfalfa (MsCOMT), and TaCM protein had high immunoreactive activity with MsCOMT antibody. Kinetic analysis indicated that the recombinant TaCM protein exhibited the highest catalyzing efficiency towards caffeoyl aldehyde and 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde as substrates, suggesting a pathway leads to S lignin via aldehyde precursors. Authority of TaCM encoding a COMT was confirmed by the expression of antisense TaCM gene in transgenic tobacco which specifically down-regulated the COMT enzyme activity. Lignin analysis showed that the reduction in COMT activity resulted in a marginal decrease in lignin content but sharp reduction in the syringl lignin. Furthermore, the TaCM protein exhibited a strong activity towards ester precursors including caffeoyl-CoA and 5-hydroxyferuloyl-CoA. Our results demonstrate that TaCM is a typical COMT involved in lignin biosynthesis. It also supports the notion, in agreement with a structural analysis, that COMT has a broad substrate preference."

The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of dietary inulin on the gene expression of selected intestinal Fe transporters and binding proteins. Anaemic piglets at age 5 weeks were allocated to a standard maize-soya diet (control) or the same diet supplemented with inulin at a level of 4 %. After 6 weeks, the animals were killed and caecum contents and sections of the duodenum and colon were removed. Segments of the genes encoding for the pig divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1) and duodenal cytochrome-b reductase (Dcytb) were isolated and sequenced. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses were performed to evaluate the expression of DMT1, Dcytb, ferroportin, ferritin, transferrin receptor (TfR) and mucin genes. DMT1, Dcytb, ferroportin, ferritin and TfR mRNA levels in duodenal samples were significantly higher in the inulin group (P < or = 0.05) compared with the control. In colon, DMT1, TfR and ferritin mRNA levels significantly increased in the inulin group. Additionally, the caecal content microflora was examined using 16S rDNA targeted probes from bacterial DNA. The Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium populations were significantly increased in the inulin group (P < or = 0.05) compared with the control group. These results indicate that dietary inulin might trigger an up regulation of genes encoding for Fe transporters in the enterocyte. The specific mechanism for this effect remains to be elucidated."

"16662920","abstracttext","Cotyledons of light-grown soybean (Glycine max L. var Wayne) seedlings were used as a model system to study the possibility that aging requires qualitative changes in protein synthesis. Cotyledons reached a final stage of senescence and then abscised about 22 days after imbibition. Cotyledon senescence was reversed at 20 days after germination by epicotyl removal. Thereafter, the cotyledons regained much of the chlorophyll, RNA, protein, and polyribosomes lost during aging.Total poly(A)mRNA was extracted from 4-, 12-, 20-day-old, and rejuvenated cotyledons and translated in a wheat germ system. Comparison of translation products on two-dimensional O'Farrell gels showed that many translation products increased in quantity during aging, while roughly half as many decreased. Rejuvenation returned the translation products to approximately 4-day-old levels in roughly half of those products which were diminished with age. Conversely, almost one-third of the products which had increased with age decreased with rejuvenation. None of the translation products were totally lost nor were newly synthesized products detected during aging. Therefore, aging in this system probably does not involve complete gene repression or depression. The observation that epicotyl removal causes a reversal in the levels of various proteins synthesized in vitro was corroborated by similar observations following in vivo labeling of cotyledon sections and analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography. Densitometric scans of fluorograms revealed a gradual shift in profiles of both in vitro and in vivo translation products during aging. Rejuvenated cotyledon proteins had a profile resembling that of 4-day-old cotyledons. The overall level of [(35)S]methionine incorporation into protein in vivo declined gradually during aging but was restored to 4-day-old levels within 2 days after epicotyl removal."
"18251390","articletitle","Necrotic enteritis potential in a model system using Clostridium perfringens isolated from field outbreaks."
"18251390","abstracttext","Necrotic enteritis is an enteric disease of avian species caused by the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium perfringens. The disease is regularly controlled in the broiler chicken industry with antimicrobials in feed but is reemerging in areas such as Europe where there is a ban on antimicrobials as growth promoters. To study prospective therapies, researchers must be able to reproduce this disease in a controlled environment, but this is not always possible because of differences in the pathogenicity of C. perfringens strains. Our objective was to test the potential of five isolates (SNECP43, 44, 47, 49, and 50), taken from field cases of necrotic enteritis, at recreating the disease in a controlled challenge experiment. SNECP43 and 50 were derived from a common clone, with SNECP50 passed in vivo and SNECP43 subcultured in vitro. Four hundred birds were divided into 16 pens, with three pens each receiving one of five treatments, with one control pen. Day-old birds were raised on a high wheat-based diet to promote necrotic enteritis development and were challenged with between 3.4 x 10(9) and 3.2 x 10(11) colony-forming units (cfu) of C. perfringens in feed for a period of 24 hr starting on day 13 of the challenge experiment. Lesion scores were assessed on two birds per pen sacrificed on day 17 and on any dead birds during the 25-day study. Growth performance was assessed up to 25 days, and mortality recorded throughout. Only SNECP50 produced necrotic enteritis mortalities significantly different (P < or = 0.05) from the control. The five isolates were also typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to assess their genetic relatedness. All epidemiologically unrelated isolates were deemed genetically unrelated, whereas SNECP43 and 50 differed by only a single minor band. Toxin type was assessed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was also used for the detection of the gene encoding the beta2-toxin."

"18762936","abstracttext","The gene encoding a glycoside hydrolase family 43 enzyme termed deAX was isolated and subcloned from a culture seeded with a compost starter mixed bacterium population, expressed with a C-terminal His(6)-tag, and purified to apparent homogeneity. deAX was monomeric in solution and had a broad pH maximum between pH 5.5 and pH 7. A twofold greater k (cat)/K (m) for the p-nitrophenyl derivative of alpha-L: -arabinofuranose versus that for the isomeric substrate beta-D-xylopyranose was due to an appreciably lower K (m) for the arabinofuranosyl substrate. Substrate inhibition was observed for both 4-methylumbelliferryl arabinofuranoside and the xylopyranoside cogener. While no loss of activity was observed over 4 h at 40 degrees C, the observed t (1/2) value rapidly decreased from 630 min at 49 degrees C to 47 min at 53 degrees C. The enzyme exhibited end-product inhibition, with a K (i) for xylose of 145 mM, 18.5 mM for arabinose, and 750 mM for glucose. Regarding natural substrate specificity, deAX had arabinofuranosidase activity on sugar beet arabinan, 1,5-alpha-L-arabinobiose, and 1,5-alpha-L-arabinotriose, and wheat and rye arabinoxylan, while xylosidase activity was detected for the substrates xylobiose, xylotriose, xylotetraose, and arabinoxylan from beech and birch. Thus, deAX can be classified as a dual-function xylosidase/arabinofuranosidase with respect to both artificial and natural substrate specificity."
"18689900","articletitle","Experimental estimation of mutation rates in a wheat population with a gene genealogy approach."
"18689900","abstracttext","Microsatellite markers are extensively used to evaluate genetic diversity in natural or experimental evolving populations. Their high degree of polymorphism reflects their high mutation rates. Estimates of the mutation rates are therefore necessary when characterizing diversity in populations. As a complement to the classical experimental designs, we propose to use experimental populations, where the initial state is entirely known and some intermediate states have been thoroughly surveyed, thus providing a short timescale estimation together with a large number of cumulated meioses. In this article, we derived four original gene genealogy-based methods to assess mutation rates with limited bias due to relevant model assumptions incorporating the initial state, the number of new alleles, and the genetic effective population size. We studied the evolution of genetic diversity at 21 microsatellite markers, after 15 generations in an experimental wheat population. Compared to the parents, 23 new alleles were found in generation 15 at 9 of the 21 loci studied. We provide evidence that they arose by mutation. Corresponding estimates of the mutation rates ranged from 0 to 4.97 x 10(-3) per generation (i.e., year). Sequences of several alleles revealed that length polymorphism was only due to variation in the core of the microsatellite. Among different microsatellite characteristics, both the motif repeat number and an independent estimation of the Nei diversity were correlated with the novel diversity. Despite a reduced genetic effective size, global diversity at microsatellite markers increased in this population, suggesting that microsatellite diversity should be used with caution as an indicator in biodiversity conservation issues."
"18690031","articletitle","Role of positively charged amino acids in the M2D transmembrane helix of Ktr/Trk/HKT type cation transporters."
"18690031","abstracttext","Studies suggest that Ktr/Trk/HKT-type transporters have evolved from multiple gene fusions of simple K(+) channels of the KcsA type into proteins that span the membrane at least eight times. Several positively charged residues are present in the eighth transmembrane segment, M2(D), in the transporters but not K(+) channels. Some models of ion transporters require a barrier to prevent free diffusion of ions down their electrochemical gradient, and it is possible that the positively charged residues within the transporter pore may prevent transporters from being channels. Here we studied the functional role of these positive residues in three Ktr/Trk/HKT-type transporters (Synechocystis KtrB-mediated K(+) uniporter, Arabidopsis AtHKT1-mediated Na(+) uniporter and wheat TaHKT1-mediated K(+)/Na(+) symporter) by examining K(+) uptake rates in E. coli, electrophysiological measurements in oocytes and growth rates of E. coli and yeast. The conserved Arg near the middle of the M2(D) segment was essential for the K(+) transport activity of KtrB and plant HKTs. Combined replacement of several positive residues in TaHKT1 showed that the positive residue at the beginning of the M2(D), which is conserved in many K(+) channels, also contributed to cation transport activity. This positive residue and the conserved Arg both face towards the ion conducting pore side. We introduced an atomic-scale homology model for predicting amino acid interactions. Based on the experimental results and the model, we propose that a salt bridge(s) exists between positive residues in the M2(D) and conserved negative residues in the pore region to reduce electrostatic repulsion against cation permeation caused by the positive residue(s). This salt bridge may help stabilize the transporter configuration, and may also prevent the conformational change that occurs in channels."
"18641397","articletitle","A transient assay system for the assessment of cell-autonomous gene function in dehydration-stressed barley."
"18641397","abstracttext","Drought is a serious, worldwide problem for crop production and also affects yields of barley and wheat, together with other stressors such as frost, viral diseases, or fungal pathogens. Although a number of candidate genes have been identified by transcriptome approaches in recent years, only very few have been tested in functional assays for a beneficial effect on drought tolerance. Here, a transient assay system in microprojectile-bombarded barley leaves is described that allows the functional testing of dehydration stress-related candidate genes by RNA interference (RNAi) or overexpression. Cellular stress or damage in dedydrated leaves is reported by a reduced accumulation of slowly maturing, native red-fluorescing protein DsRed that is known to be sensitive to denaturing conditions. After a dehydration-stress period of 4 d during which the relative fresh weight of leaves was kept at 60-66% of initial fresh weight, a reproducible reduction of normalized DsRed fluorescence was observed. In order to obtain proof of concept, a number of barley mRNAs homologous to drought response genes were selected and targeted by transient induced gene silencing (TIGS). TIGS of four tested genes resulted in a significantly stronger decrease of normalized DsRed fluorescence in dehydration-stressed leaves, whereas they had no effect in fully turgescent control leaves. These genes encode barley drought-responsive factor HvDRF1 (DREB2-like), dehydrin 6, late embryogenesis-abundant protein HVA1, and the vacuolar sodium/proton antiporter HvHNX1. The four targeted transcripts were also found to accumulate rapidly in dehydration-stressed barley leaf segments. The results suggest a value of the TIGS system for functional pre-screening of larger numbers of drought or dehydration stress-related candidate genes in barley."

"17626820","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to investigate intestinal nutrient transporter and enzyme mRNA in broilers selected on corn- and soybean-based (line A) or wheat-based (line B) diets. We investigated the peptide transporter PepT1, 10 amino acid transporters (rBAT, b(o,+)AT, ATB(o,+), CAT1, CAT2, LAT1, y(+)LAT1, y(+)LAT2, B(o)AT, and EAAT3), 4 sugar transporters (SGLT1, SGLT5, GLUT5, and GLUT2), and a digestive enzyme (aminopeptidase N). Intestine was collected at embryo d 18 and 20, day of hatch, and d 1, 3, 7, and 14 posthatch. The mRNA abundance of each gene was assayed using real-time PCR and the absolute quantification method. For PepT1, line B had greater quantities of mRNA compared with line A (P = 0.001), suggesting a greater capacity for absorption of amino acids as peptides. Levels of PepT1 mRNA were greatest in the duodenum (P < 0.05), whereas the abundances of SGLT1, GLUT5, and GLUT2 mRNA were greatest in the jejunum (P < 0.05). Abundances of EAAT3, b(o,+)AT, rBAT, B(o)AT, LAT1, CAT2, SGLT5, and aminopeptidase N mRNA were greatest in the ileum (P < 0.05). Quantities of PepT1, EAAT3, B(o)AT, SGLT1, GLUT5, and GLUT2 mRNA increased linearly (P < 0.01), whereas CAT1, CAT2, y(+)LAT1, and LAT1 mRNA decreased linearly (P < 0.05) with age. Abundance of y(+)LAT2 mRNA changed cubically (P = 0.002) with peaks of expression at day of hatch and d 7, and aminopeptidase N and SGLT5 mRNA changed quadratically (P = 0.005) with age. These results provide a comprehensive profile of the temporal and spatial expression of nutrient transporter mRNA in the small intestine of chicks."

"18542913","abstracttext","We previously mapped mRNA transcript abundance traits (expression-QTL or eQTL) using the Barley1 Affymetrix array and 'whole plant' tissue from 139 progeny of the Steptoe x Morex (St/Mx) reference barley mapping population. Of the 22,840 probesets (genes) on the array, 15,987 reported transcript abundance signals that were suitable for eQTL analysis, and this revealed a genome-wide distribution of 23,738 significant eQTLs. Here we have explored the potential of using these mRNA abundance eQTL traits as surrogates for the identification of candidate genes underlying the interaction between barley and the wheat stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici. We re-analysed quantitative 'resistance phenotype' data collected on this population in 1990/1991 and identified six loci associated with barley's reaction to stem rust. One of these coincided with the major stem rust resistance locus Rpg1, that we had previously positionally cloned using this population. Correlation analysis between phenotype values for rust infection and mRNA abundance values reported by the 22,840 GeneChip probe sets placed Rpg1, which is on the Barley1 GeneChip, in the top five candidate genes for the major QTL on chromosome 7H corresponding to the location of Rpg1. A second co-located with the rpg4/Rpg5 stem rust resistance locus that has been mapped in a different population and the remaining four were novel. Correlation analyses identified candidate genes for the rpg4/Rpg5 locus on chromosome 5H. By combining our data with additional published mRNA profiling data sets, we identify a putative sensory transduction histidine kinase as a strong candidate for a novel resistance locus on chromosome 2H and compile candidate gene lists for the other three loci."

"20305029","abstracttext","The recent decrease in the sensitivity of the Western European population of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola to azole fungicides has been associated with the emergence and subsequent spread of mutations in the CYP51 gene, encoding the azole target sterol 14alpha-demethylase. In this study, we have expressed wild-type and mutated M. graminicola CYP51 (MgCYP51) variants in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant carrying a doxycycline-regulatable tetO(7)-CYC promoter controlling native CYP51 expression. We have shown that the wild-type MgCYP51 protein complements the function of the orthologous protein in S. cerevisiae. Mutant MgCYP51 proteins containing amino acid alterations L50S, Y459D, and Y461H and the two-amino-acid deletion DeltaY459/G460, commonly identified in modern M. graminicola populations, have no effect on the capacity of the M. graminicola protein to function in S. cerevisiae. We have also shown that the azole fungicide sensitivities of transformants expressing MgCYP51 variants with these alterations are substantially reduced. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that the I381V substitution, correlated with the recent decline in the effectiveness of azoles, destroys the capacity of MgCYP51 to complement the S. cerevisiae mutant when introduced alone. However, when I381V is combined with changes between residues Y459 and Y461, the function of the M. graminicola protein is partially restored. These findings demonstrate, for the first time for a plant pathogenic fungus, the impacts that naturally occurring CYP51 alterations have on both azole sensitivity and intrinsic protein function. In addition, we also provide functional evidence underlying the order in which CYP51 alterations in the Western European M. graminicola population emerged."

Falcon was shown to be one of the tolerant turfgrass species in response to varying levels of glyphosate [5% (1.58 mM), 20% (6.32 mM)] recommended for weed control. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the mRNA expression patterns and miRNA, critical regulators of gene expression, in response to varying levels of glyphosate treatments. Here, we investigate the transcriptome and miRNA-guided post-transcriptional networks using plant miRNA microarray and Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array platforms. Transcriptome analysis revealed 93 up-regulated and 78 down-regulated genes, whereas a smaller number showed inverse differential expressions. miRNA chip analysis indicated a number of (34 out of the 853) plant miRNAs were differentially regulated in response to glyphosate treatments. Target transcripts of differentially regulated miRNAs were predicted and nine of them were quantified by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Target transcripts of miRNAs validate the expression level change of miRNAs detected by miRNA microarray analysis. Down-regulation of miRNAs upon 5 and 20% glyphosate applications led to the up-regulation of their target observed by qRT-PCR or vice versa. Quantification of F. arundinacea miRNA, homologous of osa-miR1436, revealed the agreement between the Affymetrix and miRNA microarray analyses. In addition to miRNA microarray experiment, 25 conserved F. arundinacea miRNAs were identified through homology-based approach and their secondary structures were predicted.

"20097789","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA) is postulated to be a ubiquitous hormone that plays a central role in seed development and responses to environmental stresses of vascular plants. However, in liverworts (Marchantiophyta), which represent the oldest extant lineage of land plants, the role of ABA has been least emphasized; thus, very little information is available on the molecular mechanisms underlying ABA responses. In this study, we isolated and characterized MpABI1, an ortholog of ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE1 (ABI1), from the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha. The MpABI1 cDNA encoded a 568-amino acid protein consisting of the carboxy-terminal protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C) domain and a novel amino-terminal regulatory domain. The MpABI1 transcript was detected in the gametophyte, and its expression level was increased by exogenous ABA treatment in the gemma, whose growth was strongly inhibited by ABA. Experiments using green fluorescent protein fusion constructs indicated that MpABI1 was mainly localized in the nucleus and that its nuclear localization was directed by the amino-terminal domain. Transient overexpression of MpABI1 in M. polymorpha and Physcomitrella patens cells resulted in suppression of ABA-induced expression of the wheat Em promoter fused to the beta -glucuronidase gene. Transgenic P. patens expressing MpABI1 and its mutant construct, MpABI1-d2, lacking the amino-terminal domain, had reduced freezing and osmotic stress tolerance, and associated with reduced accumulation of ABA-induced late embryogenesis abundant-like boiling-soluble proteins. Furthermore, ABA-induced morphological changes leading to brood cells were not prominent in these transgenic plants. These results suggest that MpABI1 is a negative regulator of ABA signaling, providing unequivocal molecular evidence of PP2C-mediated ABA response mechanisms functioning in liverworts."

A SAGE analysis indicated a strong stage-specific regulation of transcripts encoding secreted proteins. The average sequence identity of putative secreted proteins to their closest orthologs in the wheat stem rust Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici was dramatically reduced compared with non-secreted ones.

"20579407","articletitle","Dietary strategies of immunomodulation in infants at risk for celiac disease."
"20579407","abstracttext","Celiac disease is an inflammatory disorder of the small intestine, triggered by the ingestion of gluten proteins contained in wheat, barley or rye, in genetically susceptible individuals. This disorder is considered to be mainly mediated by cellular immunity and restricted to the human leucocyte antigen-DQ presentation of gluten-derived toxic peptides to T-cells. Moreover, the involvement of innate immunity has been recently demonstrated to be necessary also for the development of intestinal tissue damage. Genetic susceptibility accounts for an uncertain proportion of the disease risk and gluten introduction works as the precipitating factor. However, currently, the research interest is also focused on environmental factors and gene-environment interactions, especially during the first months of life, which might help explain the onset of the disease. Infectious and dietary factors that could modulate the immune response orientating it either towards tolerance or intolerance/autoimmunity are the focus of primary attention. A significant number of studies have looked into the protective effect of breast-feeding against the disease. It is generally accepted that breast-feeding during the introduction of dietary gluten and increasing the duration of breast-feeding are associated with reduced risk of developing celiac disease. However, it is still not fully established whether breast-feeding truly protects with permanent tolerance acquisition or only reduces the symptoms and delays the diagnosis. Moreover, the timing and dose of gluten introduction also seem to be relevant and long-term prospective cohort studies are being carried out in order to elucidate its role in celiac disease development."

"20575507","abstracttext","Autoimmune diseases are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by immune reactions against either a major or a limited number of the bodies own autoantigens, causing inflammation and damage to tissues and organs. Thus, identification of autoantigens is an important first step to understanding autoimmune diseases. Here we demonstrate a simple screening method for identification of autoantigens reacting with patient serum antibodies by combination of an N-terminal biotinylated protein library (BPL), produced using a wheat cell-free protein production system, and a commercially available luminescence system. Optimization studies using well-characterized autoantigens showed specific interactions between N-terminal biotinylated proteins and antibody that were sensitively detected under homogeneous reaction conditions. In this optimized assay, 1 microL of the translation mixture expressing the biotinylated proteins produced significant luminescence signal by addition of diluted serum between 1:500 and 1:10 000 in 25 microL of reaction volume. For the BPL construction, 214 mouse genes, consisting of 103 well-known autoantigens and 111 genes in the mouse autoimmune susceptibility loci, and the sera of MRL/lpr mouse were used as an autoimmune model. By this screening method, 25 well-known autoantigens and 71 proteins in the loci were identified as autoantigen proteins specifically reacting with sera antibodies. Cross-referencing with the Gene Ontology Database, 26 and 38 of autoantigen proteins were predicted to have nuclear localization and identified as membrane and/or extracellular proteins. The immune reaction of six randomly selected proteins was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblot analyses. Interestingly, three autoantigen proteins were recognized by immunoprecipitation but not by immunoblot analysis. These results suggest that the BPL-based method could provide a simple system for screening of autoantigen proteins and would help with identification of autoantigen proteins reacting with antibodies that recognize folded proteins, rather than denatured or unfolded forms."

"20507513","abstracttext_summary","Thirteen cDNA libraries constructed from small amounts of leaf rust mRNA using optimized methods served as the source for the generation of 25 558 high-quality DNA sequence reads. Five life-cycle stages were sampled: resting urediniospores, urediniospores germinated over water or plant extract, compatible, interactive stages during appressorium or haustorium formation just before sporulation, and an incompatible interaction. mRNA populations were subjected to treatments such as full-length cDNA production, subtractive and normalizing hybridizations, and size selection methods combined with PCR amplification. Pathogen and host sequences from interactive libraries were differentiated in silico using cereal and fungal sequences, codon usage analyses, and by means of a partial prototype cDNA microarray hybridized with genomic DNAs. This yielded a non-redundant unigene set of 9760 putative fungal sequences consisting of 6616 singlets and 3144 contigs, representing 4.7 Mbp. At an E-value 10(-5), 3670 unigenes (38%) matched sequences in various databases and collections but only 694 unigenes (7%) were similar to genes with known functions. In total, 296 unigenes were identified as most probably wheat and ten as rRNA sequences. Annotation rates were low for germinated urediniospores (4%) and appressoria (2%). Gene sets obtained from the various life-cycle stages appear to be remarkably different, suggesting drastic reprogramming of the transcriptome during these major differentiation processes. Redundancy within contigs yielded information about possible expression levels of certain genes among stages. Many sequences were similar to genes from other rusts such as Uromyces and Melampsora species; some of these genes have been implicated in pathogenicity and virulence."
"20507537","articletitle","Identification of loci controlling non-host disease resistance in Arabidopsis against the leaf rust pathogen Puccinia triticina."
"20507537","abstracttext","SUMMARY Plant immunity against the majority of microbial pathogens is conveyed by a phenomenon termed non-host resistance (NHR). This multifactorial trait provides durable protection against a given pathogen species. We investigated the molecular basis of NHR in Arabidopsis against the wheat leaf rust pathogen, Puccinia triticina (Ptr). Urediospores germinated with high efficiency and grew randomly over the Arabidopsis leaf surface. However, only 12% of urediospores produced a germ tube that successfully located a stoma and just 0.2% of urediospores went on to produce a haustorium within a penetrated mesophyll cell. Attempted Ptr infection induced the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROIs), nitric oxide (NO), salicylic acid (SA) and camalexin. The expression of SA, jasmonic acid (JA) and ROI-dependent genes was also detected. A series of well-characterized defence-related mutants were challenged with Ptr, but none of these lines exhibited significantly increased susceptibility to this fungus. Our findings also suggest that attempted Ptr infection triggers transient stomatal closure in Arabidopsis. We assessed the response of a collection of 79 geographically diverse Arabidopsis accessions to Ptr. Wa-1 plants supported a striking increase in Ptr substomatal vesicle frequency relative to all other tested accessions. Furthermore, SA and camalexin levels became elevated in Wa-1 plants relative to the Col reference line, in response to attempted Ptr infection. Additionally, the kinetics of SA-dependent gene expression was expedited in this accession relative to Col plants. To uncover the genetic architecture of NHR against Ptr, we assayed the response of the Arabidopsis Landsberg erecta (Ler) x Columbia (Col) recombinant inbred population to this fungus. Multiple small-to-medium effect quantitative trait loci were identified that govern the expression of NHR in Arabidopsis against Ptr."

In quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses this variation, captured in segregating mapping populations, is used to identify the genomic regions affecting these traits. The identification of the causal genes underlying QTLs is a major challenge for which the detection of gene expression differences is of major importance. By combining genetics with large scale expression profiling (i.e. genetical genomics), resulting in expression QTLs (eQTLs), great progress can be made in connecting phenotypic variation to genotypic diversity. In this review we discuss examples from human, mouse, Drosophila, yeast and plant research to illustrate the advances in genetical genomics, with a focus on understanding the regulatory mechanisms underlying natural variation. With their tolerance to inbreeding, short generation time and ease to generate large families, plants are ideal subjects to test new concepts in genetics. The comprehensive resources which are available for Arabidopsis make it a favorite model plant but genetical genomics also found its way to important crop species like rice, barley and wheat. We discuss eQTL profiling with respect to cis and trans regulation and show how combined studies with other 'omics' technologies, such as metabolomics and proteomics may further augment current information on transcriptional, translational and metabolomic signaling pathways and enable reconstruction of detailed regulatory networks. The fast developments in the 'omics' area will offer great potential for genetical genomics to elucidate the genotype-phenotype relationships for both fundamental and applied research."

"20554126","abstracttext","Cereal-rich diets used in ruminant intensive production can affect the physiology of the rumen wall but little is known about the changes induced to the epimural bacterial community. Dynamics in epimural bacteria was monitored by PCR-DGGE on four wethers fed forage for 20 weeks (constant diet) and on four wethers fed successively forage, a high concentrate diet (65% wheat) and forage for 4, 8 and 8 weeks, respectively (variable diet group). In the constant diet group, no changes were observed throughout time. In contrast, in the variable diet group, the community tended to differ between high concentrate and forage samples (P=0.06). For both groups, the structure of the community was strongly associated to individual hosts (P=0.001). This difference between individuals could have masked the effect of cereal on the variable diet group. To get more information on the phylotypes present, 120 16S rDNA gene clones were sequenced from the rumen epithelium of a wether fed forage and cereal-rich diets. Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria were the predominant phyla but the bacterial types detected were in general different from those commonly found in rumen contents with a high proportion of Proteobacteria (14%) in the rumen epithelium. In the forage periods, Firmicutes represented nearly 50% of the total epimural community and Bacteroidetes were about 33%, while in the concentrate-rich diet period these percentages were inversed (P<0.05). Clone libraries seemed more sensitive than PCR-DGGE to study the bacteria attached to the rumen epithelium. The role of epimural bacteria on ruminant's health needs further investigation."
"20419097","articletitle","Comparative genomics of flowering time pathways using Brachypodium distachyon as a model for the temperate grasses."
"20419097","abstracttext","Brachypodium distachyon (Brachypodium) is a model for the temperate grasses which include important cereals such as barley, wheat and oats. Comparison of the Brachypodium genome (accession Bd21) with those of the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana and the tropical cereal rice (Oryza sativa) provides an opportunity to compare and contrast genetic pathways controlling important traits. We analysed the homologies of genes controlling the induction of flowering using pathways curated in Arabidopsis Reactome as a starting point. Pathways include those detecting and responding to the environmental cues of day length (photoperiod) and extended periods of low temperature (vernalization). Variation in these responses has been selected during cereal domestication, providing an interesting comparison with the wild genome of Brachypodium. Brachypodium Bd21 has well conserved homologues of circadian clock, photoperiod pathway and autonomous pathway genes defined in Arabidopsis and homologues of vernalization pathway genes defined in cereals with the exception of VRN2 which was absent. Bd21 also lacked a member of the CO family (CO3). In both cases flanking genes were conserved showing that these genes are deleted in at least this accession. Segmental duplication explains the presence of two CO-like genes in temperate cereals, of which one (Hd1) is retained in rice, and explains many differences in gene family structure between grasses and Arabidopsis. The conserved fine structure of duplications shows that they largely evolved to their present structure before the divergence of the rice and Brachypodium. Of four flowering-time genes found in rice but absent in Arabidopsis, two were found in Bd21 (Id1, OsMADS51) and two were absent (Ghd7, Ehd1). Overall, results suggest that an ancient core photoperiod pathway promoting flowering via the induction of FT has been modified by the recruitment of additional lineage specific pathways that promote or repress FT expression."

"19756470","abstracttext","A highly polymorphic core collection of bread wheat and a more narrow-based breeding material, gathered from pedigrees of seven modern cultivars, was analysed in order to compare genetic diversity indices and linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns along the chromosome 3B with microsatellite (SSR) and Diversity Arrays Technology markers. Five ancestral gene pools could be identified within the core collection, indicating a strong geographical structure (Northwest Europe, Southeast Europe, CIMMYT-ICARDA group, Asia, Nepal). The breeding material showed a temporal structure, corresponding to different periods of breeding programmes [old varieties (from old landraces to 1919), semi-modern varieties (1920-1959), modern varieties (1960-2006)]. Basic statistics showed a higher genetic diversity in the core collection than in the breeding material, indicating a stronger selection pressure in this latter material. More generally, the chromosome 3B had a lower diversity than the whole B-genome. LD was weak in all studied materials. Amongst geographical groups, the CIMMYT-ICARDA pool presented the longest ranged LD in contrast to Asian accessions. In the breeding material, LD increased from old cultivars to modern varieties. Genitors of seven modern cultivars were found to be different; most marker pairs in significant LD were observed amongst genitors of Alexandre and Koreli varieties, indicating an important inbreeding effect. At low genetic distances (0-5 cM), the breeding material had higher LD than the core collection, but globally the two materials had similar values in all classes. Marker pairs in significant LD are generally observed around the centromere in both arms and at distal position on the short arm of the chromosome 3B."
"19762471","articletitle","Biochemical characterization of two wheat phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase isoforms with different sensitivities to inhibition by phosphatidic acid."
"19762471","abstracttext","In plants the triple methylation of phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine catalyzed by phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEAMT) is considered a rate-limiting step in the de novo synthesis of phosphatidylcholine. Besides being a major membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylcholine can be hydrolyzed into choline and phosphatidic acid. Phosphatidic acid is widely recognized as a second messenger in stress signaling, and choline can be oxidized within the chloroplast to yield the putative osmoprotectant glycine betaine. Here we describe the cloning and biochemical characterization of a second wheat PEAMT isoform that has a four times higher specific activity than the previously described WPEAMT/TaPEAMT1 enzyme and is less sensitive to product inhibition by S-adenosyl homocysteine, but more sensitive to inhibition by phosphocholine. Both enzymes follow a sequential random Bi Bi mechanism and show mixed-type product inhibition patterns with partial inhibition for TaPEAMT1 and a strong non-competitive component for TaPEAMT2. An induction of TaPEAMT protein expression and activity is observed after cold exposure, ahead of an increase in gene expression. Our results demonstrate direct repression of in vitro enzymatic activities by phosphatidic acid for both enzymes, with TaPEAMT1 being more sensitive than TaPEAMT2 in the physiological concentration range. Other lipid ligands identified in protein-lipid overlays are phosphoinositide mono- as well as some di-phosphates and cardiolipin. These results provide new insights into the complex regulatory circuits of phospholipid biosynthesis in plants and underline the importance of head group biosynthesis in adaptive stress responses."
"19687280","articletitle","Molecular cloning and tissue distribution of reduced folate carrier and effect of dietary folate supplementation on the expression of reduced folate carrier in laying hens."
"19687280","abstracttext","The reduced folate carrier (RFC) has been postulated to be a major entity for folate transport activity in humans and other mammals. However, there are limited reports of the importance of RFC in an avian system. In the current study, therefore, the molecular cloning and tissue distribution of RFC, as well as the effect of dietary folate supplementation on the expression of this transporter, were investigated in the chicken. Shaver White laying hens (n=8 per diet) received 3 wheat-based diets containing the following: 1) no supplemental folate, 2) folic acid (10.00 mg/kg), or 3) 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (11.30 mg/kg) for 21 d. The mRNA expression levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the cloned partial RFC cDNA containing the full coding region from duodenum was 99% homologous to the reference gene available in GenBank. A broad expression profile of RFC transcripts was observed, with RFC mRNA detected in the brain, liver, kidney, spleen, lung, intestine, ovary, and testis, as well as other tissues. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that no significant differences (P>0.05) due to diet were found in the mRNA levels of RFC in the duodenum and cecum. However, compared with the basal diet, jejunal mRNA levels of RFC were decreased (P<0.05) in hens fed with the 5-methyltetrahydrofolate diet, but the reduction did not reach significance (P=0.077) in the hens fed the folic acid diet. Overall, the current study demonstrated that the RFC cDNA containing the full coding region was successfully cloned from the duodenum of laying hens. The wide tissue distribution of RFC transcripts is suggestive of an important role of RFC in the process of folate transport in the chicken. Moreover, dietary folate supplementation could downregulate the jejunal mRNA expression of RFC. Such findings will lay the foundation of future work involving the RFC in avian systems, including laying hens."
"19717630","articletitle","Protozoan-induced regulation of cyclic lipopeptide biosynthesis is an effective predation defense mechanism for Pseudomonas fluorescens."
"19717630","abstracttext","Environmental bacteria are exposed to a myriad of biotic interactions that influence their function and survival. The grazing activity of protozoan predators significantly impacts the dynamics, diversification, and evolution of bacterial communities in soil ecosystems. To evade protozoan predation, bacteria employ various defense strategies. Soil-dwelling Pseudomonas fluorescens strains SS101 and SBW25 produce the cyclic lipopeptide surfactants (CLPs) massetolide and viscosin, respectively, in a quorum-sensing-independent manner. In this study, CLP production was shown to protect these bacteria from protozoan predation as, compared to CLP-deficient mutants, strains SS101 and SBW25 exhibited resistance to grazing by Naegleria americana in vitro and superior persistence in soil in the presence of this bacterial predator. In the wheat rhizosphere, CLP-producing strains had a direct deleterious impact on the survival of N. americana. In vitro assays further showed that N. americana was three times more sensitive to viscosin than to massetolide and that exposure of strain SS101 or SBW25 to this protozoan resulted in upregulation of CLP biosynthesis genes. Enhanced expression of the massABC and viscABC genes did not require physical contact between the two organisms as gene expression levels were up to threefold higher in bacterial cells harvested 1 cm from feeding protozoans than in cells collected 4 cm from feeding protozoans. These findings document a new natural function of CLPs and highlight that bacterium-protozoan interactions can result in activation of an antipredator response in prey populations."

"19747391","abstracttext_background","Cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), a starchy root crop grown in tropical and subtropical climates, is the sixth most important crop in the world after wheat, rice, maize, potato and barley. The repertoire of simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for cassava is limited and warrants a need for a larger number of polymorphic SSRs for germplasm characterization and breeding applications."
"19747391","abstracttext_results","A total of 846 putative microsatellites were identified in silico from an 8,577 cassava unigene set with an average density of one SSR every 7 kb. One hundred and ninety-two candidate SSRs were screened for polymorphism among a panel of cassava cultivars from Africa, Latin America and Asia, four wild Manihot species as well as two other important taxa in the Euphorbiaceae, leafy spurge (Euphorbia esula) and castor bean (Ricinus communis). Of 168 markers with clean amplification products, 124 (73.8%) displayed polymorphism based on high resolution agarose gels. Of 85 EST-SSR markers screened, 80 (94.1%) amplified alleles from one or more wild species (M epruinosa, M glaziovii, M brachyandra, M tripartita) whereas 13 (15.3%) amplified alleles from castor bean and 9 (10.6%) amplified alleles from leafy spurge; hence nearly all markers were transferable to wild relatives of M esculenta while only a fraction was transferable to the more distantly related taxa. In a subset of 20 EST-SSRs assessed by fluorescence-based genotyping the number of alleles per locus ranged from 2 to 10 with an average of 4.55 per locus. These markers had a polymorphism information content (PIC) from 0.19 to 0.75 with an average value of 0.55 and showed genetic relationships consistent with existing information on these genotypes."
"19747391","abstracttext_conclusion","A set of 124 new, unique polymorphic EST-SSRs was developed and characterized which extends the repertoire of SSR markers for cultivated cassava and its wild relatives. The markers show high PIC values and therefore will be useful for cultivar identification, taxonomic studies, and genetic mapping. The study further shows that mining ESTs is a highly efficient strategy for polymorphism detection within the cultivated cassava gene pool."

"19818205","abstracttext","Using the mouse ES cell line with green fluorescent protein knocked-in at the Rx locus (Rx-KI ES cell), we previously showed that photoreceptors can be efficiently obtained in defined culture conditions by enriching Rx-positive retinal progenitor cells. We aimed to explore a protocol applicable for non-Rx-labeled stem cell lines for subsequent enrichment of retinal photoreceptor precursors for transplantation. The Rx-KI ES cell line was differentiated according to the serum-free suspension conditions with serum-free suspension/Dkk1/LeftyA/serum/activin method (SFEB/DLFA) described previously. Enrichment efficacy by negative selection was compared among 20 different lectins and the lectin combination that effectively enriched the Rx-positive cells by selecting the lectin low-binding population was determined. Subsequent differentiation efficiency to photoreceptor precursors and the contamination of Nanog or Oct3/4(+) cells in the culture were evaluated between the cell cultures using negative selection with lectins and Rx positive selection. The effect of cytarabine (Ara-C) for minimizing the contamination of undifferentiated cells after the selection was also studied. The combination of the lectins, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and Erythrina crista-galli agglutinin (ECA) enabled us to enrich the Rx-positive population by approximately twice the original Rx percentage. The selection also minimized the percentage of Oct3/4(+) cells. The lectin-selected cells produced a comparable percentage of Crx/rhodopsin-positive colonies with Rx-positive selection and were differentiated into photoreceptors. The Ara-C treatment on differentiating days 24-26 decreased Nanog and Oct3/4 expression in subsequent cultures. Enrichment of Rx-positive cells using WGA and ECA was comparable to Rx-positive selection, and the method could be applied to achieve efficient photoreceptor differentiation from other ES or iPS cell lines in which the Rx gene is not marked."

"19882661","abstracttext","The G protein alpha-subunit (Gna1) in the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum has previously been shown to be a critical controlling element in disease ontogeny. In this study, iTRAQ and 2-D LC MALDI-MS/MS have been used to characterise protein expression changes in the S. nodorum gna1 strain versus the SN15 wild-type. A total of 1336 proteins were identified. The abundance of 49 proteins was significantly altered in the gna1 strain compared with the wild-type. Gna1 was identified as having a significant regulatory role on primary metabolic pathways, particularly those concerned with NADPH synthesis or consumption. Mannitol dehydrogenase was up-regulated in the gna1 strain while mannitol 1-phosphate dehydrogenase was down-regulated providing direct evidence of Gna1 regulation over this enigmatic pathway. Enzymatic analysis and growth assays confirmed this regulatory role. Several novel hypothetical proteins previously associated with stress and pathogen responses were identified as positively regulated by Gna1. A short-chain dehydrogenase (Sch3) was also significantly less abundant in the gna1 strains. Sch3 was further characterised by gene disruption in S. nodorum by homologous recombination. Functional characterisation of the sch3 strains revealed their inability to sporulate in planta providing a further link to Gna1 signalling and asexual reproduction. These data add significantly to the identification of the regulatory targets of Gna1 signalling in S. nodorum and have demonstrated the utility of iTRAQ in dissecting signal transduction pathways."

"19884784","abstracttext","To construct a new recombinant strain of Bacillus velezensis that has antifungal and insecticidal activity via the expression of the insecticidal Bacillus thuringiensis crystal protein, a B. thuringiensis expression vector (pHT1K-1Ac) was generated that contained the B. thuringiensis cry1Ac gene under the control of its endogenous promoter in a minimal E. coli-B. thuringiensis shuttle vector (pHT1K). This vector was introduced into a B. velezensis isolate that showed high antifungal activities against several plant diseases, including rice blast (Magnaporthe grisea), rice sheath blight (Rhizotonia solani), tomato gray mold (Botrytis cinerea), tomato late blight (Phytophthora infestans), and wheat leaf rust (Puccinia recondita), by electroporation. The recombinant B. velezensis strain was confirmed by PCR using cry1Ac-specific primers. Additionally, the recombinant strain produced a protein approximately 130 kDa in size and parasporal inclusion bodies similar to B. thuringiensis. The in vivo antifungal activity assay demonstrated that the activity of the recombinant B. velezensis strain was maintained at the same level as that of wild-type B. velezensis. Furthermore, it exhibited high insecticidal activity against a lepidopteran pest, Plutella xylostella, although its activity was lower than that of a recombinant B. thuringiensis strain, whereas wild-type B. velezensis strain did not show any insecticidal activity. These results suggest that this recombinant B. velezensis strain can be used to control harmful insect pests and fungal diseases simultaneously in one crop."

"21957450","abstracttext_methodology/principal findings","Oral microorganisms with gluten-degrading capacity were obtained by a selective plating strategy using gluten agar. Microbial speciations were carried out by 16S rDNA gene sequencing. Enzyme activities were assessed using gliadin-derived enzymatic substrates, gliadins in solution, gliadin zymography, and 33-mer α-gliadin and 26-mer γ-gliadin immunogenic peptides. Fragments of the gliadin peptides were separated by RP-HPLC and structurally characterized by mass spectrometry. Strains with high activity towards gluten were typed as Rothia mucilaginosa and Rothia aeria. Gliadins (250 µg/ml) added to Rothia cell suspensions (OD(620) 1.2) were degraded by 50% after ∼30 min of incubation. Importantly, the 33-mer and 26-mer immunogenic peptides were also cleaved, primarily C-terminal to Xaa-Pro-Gln (XPQ) and Xaa-Pro-Tyr (XPY). The major gliadin-degrading enzymes produced by the Rothia strains were ∼70-75 kDa in size, and the enzyme expressed by Rothia aeria was active over a wide pH range (pH 3-10)."

"21875448","abstracttext","The potential benefits on human health have prompted an interest in developing nutritional strategies for reducing saturated and increasing specific unsaturated fatty acids (FA) in ruminant milk. The impact of the level and type of starchy concentrate added to diets supplemented with sunflower-seed oil on caprine milk FA composition and on mammary, omental and perirenal adipose, and liver lipid metabolism was examined in fourteen Alpine goats in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with 21 d experimental periods. Treatments were a grass hay-based diet with a high level of forage (F) or a high level of concentrate with either maize grain (CM) or flattened wheat (CW) as source of starch and supplemented with 130 g/d sunflower-seed oil. Milk yield was enhanced (P<0·01) and milk fat content was decreased on the CM and CW diets compared with the F diet, resulting in similar milk fat secretion. Both high-concentrate diets increased (P<0·05) milk yield of 10 : 0-16 : 0 and decreased trans-9,11-18 : 1 and cis-9, trans-11-18 : 2. The CW diet decreased (P<0·05) the output of ΣC18 and Σcis-18 : 1 and increased (P<0·05) the output of trans-10-18 : 1 in milk. The expression and/or activity of fourteen proteins involved in the major lipogenic pathways in mammary tissues and of lipogenic genes in adipose and liver tissues were similar among treatments. In conclusion, high starch concentrates alter milk FA yield via mechanisms independent of changes in mammary, liver or adipose tissue lipogenic gene expression. Furthermore, data provided indications that mammary lipogenic responses to starch-rich diets differ between caprine and bovine ruminants."

"21873161","abstracttext_background and aim","Lipopolysaccharide derived from a symbiotic bacterium in wheat (Pantoea agglomerans, LPSp) has shown multiple positive effects, such as prophylactic, antiallergic and antitumour effects, without serious side-effects. LPSp has differential biological activities in comparison to other LPS, such as those from Escherichia coli (LPSe). The only difference between LPSp and LPSe is in the O-antigen polysaccharide structure (O-PS). This led us to the hypothesis that the O-PS structure would seem to participate in biological activities. Thus, the characterization of properties of O-PS in LPS is of the utmost importance for understanding cell activation in the maintenance of homeostasis. However, little is known about the correlation between the O-PS structure of LPS and its biological activities.

"22749286","abstracttext","We investigated Chenopodium murale transgenic hairy root in vitro culture system as a new tool for allelopathic assays. Transgenic hairy roots were induced by Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4M70GUS from roots, cotyledons, leaves, and internodes of C. murale seedlings. Roots were found to be the best target explants, providing transformation efficiency of up to 11.1%. Established hairy root clones differed in their morphology and growth potential. Molecular characterization of these clones was carried out by PCR, RT-PCR and histochemical GUS analyses. No differences in rol gene expression were observed. Liquid culture system of characterized hairy root clones was maintained for over 2 years. Six hairy root clones were selected for assaying the allelopathic effect of their growth medium against germination and seedling elongation of wheat and lettuce test plants. The inhibitory potential varied depending on the hairy root clone. Some transgenic clones showed significantly higher inhibition compared to wild-type roots. These results revealed that hairy roots as an independent system synthesize some bioactive substances with allelopathic activity and exude them into the growth medium. Concentrations of caffeic, ferulic and p-coumaric acids (0.07-2.85 μmol/L) identified by HPLC analysis in the growth media were at least 1000 times lower than the inhibitory active concentration (5 mmol/L) of pure grade phenolic acids, suggesting that they have a limited role in the allelopathic phenomena of C. murale. The presented hairy root system appears to be a suitable tool for further investigation of the potential and nature of root-mediated allelopathic interference of C. murale."
"22711811","articletitle","Fusion of two divergent fungal individuals led to the recent emergence of a unique widespread pathogen species."
"22711811","abstracttext","In a genome alignment of five individuals of the ascomycete fungus Zymoseptoria pseudotritici, a close relative of the wheat pathogen Z. tritici (synonym Mycosphaerella graminicola), we observed peculiar diversity patterns. Long regions up to 100 kb without variation alternate with similarly long regions of high variability. The variable segments in the genome alignment are organized into two main haplotype groups that have diverged ∼3% from each other. The genome patterns in Z. pseudotritici are consistent with a hybrid speciation event resulting from a cross between two divergent haploid individuals. The resulting hybrids formed the new species without backcrossing to the parents. We observe no variation in 54% of the genome in the five individuals and estimate a complete loss of variation for at least 30% of the genome in the entire species. A strong population bottleneck following the hybridization event caused this loss of variation. Variable segments in the Z. pseudotritici genome exhibit the two haplotypes contributed by the parental individuals. From our previously estimated recombination map of Z. tritici and the size distribution of variable chromosome blocks untouched by recombination we estimate that the hybridization occurred ∼380 sexual generations ago. We show that the amount of lost variation is explained by genetic drift during the bottleneck and by natural selection, as evidenced by the correlation of presence/absence of variation with gene density and recombination rate. The successful spread of this unique reproductively isolated pathogen highlights the strong potential of hybridization in the emergence of pathogen species with sexual reproduction."
"23349804","articletitle","Genetic interactions underlying the biosynthesis and inhibition of β-diketones in wheat and their impact on glaucousness and cuticle permeability."
"23349804","abstracttext","Cuticular wax composition greatly impacts plant responses to dehydration. Two parallel pathways exist in Triticeae for manipulating wax composition: the acyl elongation, reduction, and decarbonylation pathway that is active at the vegetative stage and yields primary alcohols and alkanes, and the β-diketone pathway that predominates at the reproductive stage and synthesizes β-diketones. Variation in glaucousness during the reproductive stage of wheat is mainly controlled by the wax production genes, W1 and W2, and wax inhibitor genes, Iw1 and Iw2. Little is known about the metabolic and physiological effects of the genetic interactions among these genes and their roles in shifting wax composition during plant development. We characterized the effect of W1, W2, Iw1, and Iw2 and analyzed their interaction using a set of six near-isogenic lines (NILs) by metabolic, molecular and physiological approaches. Loss of functional alleles of both W genes or the presence of either Iw gene depletes β-diketones and results in the nonglaucous phenotype. Elimination of β-diketones is compensated for by an increase in aldehydes and primary alcohols in the Iw NILs. Accordingly, transcription of CER4-6, which encodes an alcohol-forming fatty acyl-CoA reductase, was elevated 120-fold in iw1Iw2. CER4-6 was transcribed at much higher levels in seedlings than in adult plants, and showed little difference between the glaucous and nonglaucous NILs, suggesting that Iw2 counteracts the developmental repression of CER4-6 at the reproductive stage. While W1 and W2 redundantly function in β-diketone biosynthesis, a combination of both functional alleles led to the β-diketone hydroxylation. Consistent with this, transcription of MAH1-9, which encodes a mid-chain alkane hydroxylase, increased seven-fold only in W1W2. In parallel with the hydroxyl-β-diketone production patterns, glaucousness was intensified and cuticle permeability was reduced significantly in W1W2 compared to the other NILs. This suggests that both W1 and W2 are required for enhancing drought tolerance."

"23440380","abstracttext","Races of stem rust fungus pose a major threat to wheat production worldwide. We mapped adult plant resistance (APR) to Ug99 in 141 lines of a PBW343/Muu recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population by phenotyping them for three seasons at Njoro, Kenya in field trials and genotyping them with Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) markers. Moderately susceptible parent PBW343 and APR parent Muu displayed mean stem rust severities of 66.6 and 5 %, respectively. The mean disease severity of RILs ranged from 1 to 100 %, with an average of 23.3 %. Variance components for stem rust severity were highly significant (p < 0.001) for RILs and seasons and the heritability (h (2)) for the disease ranged between 0.78 and 0.89. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis identified four consistent genomic regions on chromosomes 2BS, 3BS, 5BL, and 7AS; three contributed by Muu (QSr.cim-2BS, QSr.cim-3BS and QSr.cim-7AS) and one (QSr.cim-5BL) derived from PBW343. RILs with flanking markers for these QTLs had significantly lower severities than those lacking the markers, and combinations of QTLs had an additive effect, significantly enhancing APR. The QTL identified on chromosome 3BS mapped to the matching region as the known APR gene Sr2. Four additional QTLs on chromosomes 1D, 3A, 4B, and 6A reduced disease severity significantly at least once in three seasons.

"23508643","abstracttext","The cell walls of grasses such as wheat, maize, rice, and sugar cane, contain large amounts of ferulate that is ester-linked to the cell wall polysaccharide glucuronoarabinoxylan (GAX). This ferulate is considered to limit the digestibility of polysaccharide in grass biomass as it forms covalent linkages between polysaccharide and lignin components. Candidate genes within a grass-specific clade of the BAHD acyl-coA transferase superfamily have been identified as being responsible for the ester linkage of ferulate to GAX. Manipulation of these BAHD genes may therefore be a biotechnological target for increasing efficiency of conversion of grass biomass into biofuel. Here, we describe the expression of these candidate genes and amounts of bound ferulate from various tissues and developmental stages of the model grass Brachypodium distachyon. BAHD candidate transcripts and significant amounts of bound ferulate were present in every tissue and developmental stage. We hypothesize that BAHD candidate genes similar to the recently described Oryza sativa p-coumarate monolignol transferase (OsPMT) gene (PMT sub-clade) are principally responsible for the bound para-coumaric acid (pCA), and that other BAHD candidates (non-PMT sub-clade) are responsible for bound ferulic acid (FA). There were some similarities with between the ratio of expression non-PMT/PMT genes and the ratio of bound FA/pCA between tissue types, compatible with this hypothesis. However, much further work to modify BAHD genes in grasses and to characterize the heterologously expressed proteins is required to demonstrate their function."
"23515261","articletitle","Coevolution and life cycle specialization of plant cell wall degrading enzymes in a hemibiotrophic pathogen."
"23515261","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici is an important fungal pathogen on wheat that originated in the Fertile Crescent. Its closely related sister species Z. pseudotritici and Z. ardabiliae infect wild grasses in the same region. This recently emerged host-pathogen system provides a rare opportunity to investigate the evolutionary processes shaping the genome of an emerging pathogen. Here, we investigate genetic signatures in plant cell wall degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) that are likely affected by or driving coevolution in plant-pathogen systems. We hypothesize four main evolutionary scenarios and combine comparative genomics, transcriptomics, and selection analyses to assign the majority of PCWDEs in Z. tritici to one of these scenarios. We found widespread differential transcription among different members of the same gene family, challenging the idea of functional redundancy and suggesting instead that specialized enzymatic activity occurs during different stages of the pathogen life cycle. We also find that natural selection has significantly affected at least 19 of the 48 identified PCWDEs. The majority of genes showed signatures of purifying selection, typical for the scenario of conserved substrate optimization. However, six genes showed diversifying selection that could be attributed to either host adaptation or host evasion. This study provides a powerful framework to better understand the roles played by different members of multigene families and to determine which genes are the most appropriate targets for wet laboratory experimentation, for example, to elucidate enzymatic function during relevant phases of a pathogen's life cycle."

"22918457","abstracttext","A Gram-negative, non-mobile, polar single flagellum, rod-shaped bacterium WZBFD3-5A2(T) was isolated from a wheat soil subjected to herbicides for several years. Cells of strain WZBFD3-5A2(T) grow optimally on Luria-Bertani agar medium at 30 °C in the presence of 0-4.0 % (w/v) NaCl and pH 8.0. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strain WZBFD3-5A2(T) belongs to the genus Pseudomonas. Physiological and biochemical tests supported the phylogenetic affiliation. Strain WZBFD3-5A2(T) is closely related to Pseudomonas nitroreducens IAM1439(T), sharing 99.7 % sequence similarity. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments between the two strains showed only moderate reassociation similarity (33.92 ± 1.0 %). The DNA G+C content is 62.0 mol%. The predominant respiratory quinine is Q-9. The major cellular fatty acids present are C(16:0) (28.55 %), C(16:1ω6c) or C(16:1ω7c) (20.94 %), C(18:1ω7c) (17.21 %) and C(18:0) (13.73 %). The isolate is distinguishable from other related members of the genus Pseudomonas on the basis of phenotypic and biochemical characteristics. From the genotypic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic data, it is evident that strain WZBFD3-5A2(T) represents a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas nitritereducens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WZBFD3-5A2(T) (=CGMCC 1.10702(T) = LMG 25966(T))."

"22940800","abstracttext","Cellobiose dehydrogenases (CDHs) are extracellular glycosylated haemoflavoenzymes produced by many different wood-degrading and phytopathogenic fungi. Putative cellobiose dehydrogenase genes are recurrently discovered by genome sequencing projects in various phylogenetically distinct fungi. The genomes from the basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea and the ascomycete Podospora anserina were screened for candidate cdh genes, and one and three putative gene models were evidenced, respectively. Two putative cdh genes were selected and successfully expressed for the first time in Aspergillus niger. CDH activity was measured for both constructions (CDHcc and CDHpa), and both recombinant CDHs were purified to homogeneity and subsequently characterised. Kinetic constants were determined for several carbohydrates including β-1,4-linked di- and oligosaccharides. Optimal temperature and pH were 60 °C and 5 for CDHcc and 65-70 °C and 6 for CDHpa. Both CDHs showed a broad range of pH stability between 4 and 8. The effect of both CDHs on saccharification of micronized wheat straw by an industrial Trichoderma reesei secretome was determined. The addition of each CDH systematically decreased the release of total reducing sugars, but to different extents and according to the CDH concentration. Analytical methods were carried out to quantify the release of glucose, xylose and gluconic acid. An increase of glucose and xylose was measured at a low CDHcc concentration. At moderated and high CDHcc and CDHpa concentrations, glucose was severely reduced with a concomitant increase of gluconic acid. In conclusion, these results give new insights into the physical and chemical parameters and diversity of basidiomycetous and ascomycetous CDHs. These findings also demonstrated that CDH drastically influenced the saccharification on a natural substrate, and thus, CDH origin, concentration and potential enzymatic partners should be carefully considered in future artificial secretomes for biofuel applications."
"23028015","articletitle","The cyanobacterial CCM as a source of genes for improving photosynthetic CO2 fixation in crop species."
"23028015","abstracttext","Crop yields need to nearly double over the next 35 years to keep pace with projected population growth. Improving photosynthesis, via a range of genetic engineering strategies, has been identified as a promising target for crop improvement with regard to increased photosynthetic yield and better water-use efficiency (WUE). One approach is based on integrating components of the highly efficient CO(2)-concentrating mechanism (CCM) present in cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) into the chloroplasts of key C(3) crop plants, particularly wheat and rice. Four progressive phases towards engineering components of the cyanobacterial CCM into C(3) species can be envisaged. The first phase (1a), and simplest, is to consider the transplantation of cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters to C(3) chloroplasts, by host genomic expression and chloroplast targeting, to raise CO(2) levels in the chloroplast and provide a significant improvement in photosynthetic performance. Mathematical modelling indicates that improvements in photosynthesis as high as 28% could be achieved by introducing both of the single-gene, cyanobacterial bicarbonate transporters, known as BicA and SbtA, into C(3) plant chloroplasts. Part of the first phase (1b) includes the more challenging integration of a functional cyanobacterial carboxysome into the chloroplast by chloroplast genome transformation. The later three phases would be progressively more elaborate, taking longer to engineer other functional components of the cyanobacterial CCM into the chloroplast, and targeting photosynthetic and WUE efficiencies typical of C(4) photosynthesis. These later stages would include the addition of NDH-1-type CO(2) pumps and suppression of carbonic anhydrase and C(3) Rubisco in the chloroplast stroma. We include a score card for assessing the success of physiological modifications gained in phase 1a."

"23763762","abstracttext","Enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulose is a key process in the global carbon cycle and the industrial conversion of biomass to biofuels. In natural environments, cellulose hydrolysis is predominately performed by microbial communities. However, detailed understanding of bacterial cellulose hydrolysis is primarily confined to a few model isolates. Developing models for cellulose hydrolysis by mixed microbial consortia will complement these isolate studies and may reveal new mechanisms for cellulose deconstruction. Microbial communities were adapted to microcrystalline cellulose under aerobic, thermophilic conditions using green waste compost as the inoculum to study cellulose hydrolysis in a microbial consortium. This adaptation selected for three dominant taxa--the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Thermus. A high-resolution profile of community development during the enrichment demonstrated a community transition from Firmicutes to a novel Bacteroidetes population that clusters in the Chitinophagaceae family. A representative strain of this population, strain NYFB, was successfully isolated, and sequencing of a nearly full-length 16S rRNA gene demonstrated that it was only 86% identical compared with other validated strains in the phylum Bacteroidetes. Strain NYFB grew well on soluble polysaccharide substrates, but grew poorly on insoluble polysaccharide substrates. Similar communities were observed in companion thermophilic enrichments on insoluble wheat arabinoxylan, a hemicellulosic substrate, suggesting a common model for deconstruction of plant polysaccharides. Combining observations of community dynamics and the physiology of strain NYFB, a cooperative successional model for polysaccharide hydrolysis by the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes in the thermophilic cellulolytic consortia is proposed."
"18285355","articletitle","Nascent peptide-mediated translation elongation arrest of Arabidopsis thaliana CGS1 mRNA occurs autonomously."
"18285355","abstracttext","The Arabidopsis thaliana CGS1 gene encodes cystathionine gamma-synthase, the first committed enzyme of methionine biosynthesis in higher plants. Expression of CGS1 is feedback-regulated at the step of mRNA degradation in response to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet). A short stretch of amino acid sequence, termed the MTO1 region, encoded within the first exon of CGS1 itself acts in cis in the regulation. In vitro analyses using wheat germ extract (WGE) revealed that AdoMet induces temporal translation arrest of CGS1 mRNA prior to mRNA degradation. This translational pausing occurs immediately downstream of the MTO1 region and is mediated by the nascent MTO1 peptide. In order to elucidate further the nature of this unique regulatory mechanism, we have examined whether a non-plant system also contains the post-transcriptional regulation activity. Despite the fact that mammals do not carry cystathionine gamma-synthase, AdoMet was able to induce the MTO1 sequence-dependent translation elongation arrest in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL) in a similar manner to that observed in WGE. This result suggests that MTO1 peptide-mediated translation arrest does not require a plant-specific factor and rather most probably occurs via a direct interaction between the nascent MTO1 peptide and the ribosome that has translated it. In contrast, decay intermediates of CGS1 mRNA normally observed upon induction of CGS1 mRNA decay in plant systems were not detected in RRL, raising the possibility that CGS1 mRNA degradation involves a plant-specific mechanism."

"22815564","abstracttext","One hundred ten alkalo-tolerant thermophilic bacteria were isolated from 17 samples (water and sediment) collected from Manikaran. Of 110 isolates, 70 showed the production of xylanases and were further screened for growth and production of xylanases at different temperature ranging from 40 to 75°C. Eleven isolates that showed growth and xylanase production at temperatures ≥50°C were selected for quantitative estimation in modified Reese mineral liquid medium containing wheat bran. Maximum xylanase activity was produced by isolate H-7 followed by H-9 and R-9 and was statistically superior to other isolates. The microscopic observation showed that the isolates possessed the typical rod with endospore, characteristic of genus Bacillus. The isolates were found to be oxidase and catalase positive. Using BIOLOG Microlog 3 software, the isolates H7, H9 and R9 were identified as Paenibacillus ehemensis, Bacillus cereus/B. thuringiensis and B. subtilis respectively, based on utilization of 95 carbon sources. PCR-RFLP analysis of 16S rDNA indicated that the isolates were genetically different from each other. DNA sequencing of the three isolates and phylogenetic analysis revealed that all the isolates obtained from Manikaran thermal springs showed 97 to 100% similarity with the sequences within the GenBank. The closest phylogenetic neighbours according to the 16S rRNA gene sequence data for the three isolates H-7, H-9, and R-9 were Paenibacillus ehemensis, Bacillus cereus and Bacillus subtilis, respectively."

"22695861","abstracttext","It is well known that the ratio of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) ranges widely in soils, but no data exist on what might influence this ratio, its dynamism, or how changes in relative abundance influences the potential contributions of AOA and AOB to soil nitrification. By sampling intensively from cropped-to-fallowed and fallowed-to-cropped phases of a 2-year wheat/fallow cycle, and adjacent uncultivated long-term fallowed land over a 15-month period in 2010 and 2011, evidence was obtained for seasonal and cropping phase effects on the soil nitrification potential (NP), and on the relative contributions of AOA and AOB to the NP that recovers after acetylene inactivation in the presence and absence of bacterial protein synthesis inhibitors. AOB community composition changed significantly (P0.0001) in response to cropping phase, and there were both seasonal and cropping phase effects on the amoA gene copy numbers of AOA and AOB. Our study showed that the AOA:AOB shifts were generated by a combination of different phenomena: an increase in AOA amoA abundance in unfertilized treatments, compared with their AOA counterparts in the N-fertilized treatment; a larger population of AOB under the N-fertilized treatment compared with the AOB community under unfertilized treatments; and better overall persistence of AOA than AOB in the unfertilized treatments. These data illustrate the complexity of the factors that likely influence the relative contributions of AOA and AOB to nitrification under the various combinations of soil conditions and NH(4)(+)-availability that exist in the field."

"22806874","abstracttext","The objectives of this study were to test the effects of various chemical additives, and ensiling time periods on microbial profiles of whole plant wheat silage (WPWS). WPWS was harvested at dough maturation stage, and ensiled with sodium chloride (T), sodium bicarbonate (N), sucrose (S), or urea (U) at 1% dry matter (DM) (w/w). Each WPWS treatment (i.e. T, N, S, and U) was ensiled in 1 dm(3) duplicate anaerobic jars for 7, 14, 28, 35, 42, 49, and 56 days. The highest lactic acid concentration was detected for U (5.9% DM) compared to the control (0.5% DM) at day 56. Similarly, the highest ammonia concentration was observed for U (9.3% DM) compared to the control; T, N, and S treatments averaged 2.4% DM. A higher lactic acid bacteria (LAB) count was observed between days 14 and 56 for all treatments relative to control WPWS, which averaged 6.7 and 5.6 c.f.u./g of fresh material, respectively. The highest quality silage was observed for N and U treated WPWS, with an absence of yeasts and molds from days 7 to 49. Identification of bacterial isolates at days 7 and 56 from each individual silage treatment was performed based on phenotypic (biochemical tests), and molecular (16S rDNA partial gene sequence) methods. 16S rDNA sequence results identified U7 and N56 isolates as Enterococcus faecium, and demonstrated positive galactose, ribose, lactose, maltose, mannitol, mannose, sucrose, and trehalose fermenting characteristics. In addition, most isolates exhibited growth potential in 6.5% NaCl. Overall sequence alignment results supported phenotypic identification, and indicated that U and N treated WPWS were LAB (Enterococcus) dominant compared to the control (non-LAB)."

The A. niger D15 [abfB] strain expressed the α-L-arabinofuranosidase abfB gene under the transcriptional control of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase promoter (gpd(P)) and glucoamylase terminator (glaA(T)) in fermentation cultures containing 10 % glucose. The yield, activity, purity, kinetics and ability of the recombinant AbfB to selectively hydrolyse xylans into hydrogels were assessed. The recombinant AbfB secreted in 125-mL shake flasks and 10-L bioreactor fermentation cultures had specific activities against ρ-nitrophenyl-α-arabinofuranoside of up to 4.4 and 2.7 U g⁻¹ (dry weight), respectively. In addition, the recombinant AbfB was present as a single protein species on silver-stained 10 % sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The recombinant AbfB had optimal activity at 40-55 °C and pH 3.0 to pH 5.0 and was stable at temperature and pH of up to 60 °C and pH 6.0, respectively. About 20 % of the available arabinose in the xylan was released by the recombinant AbfB from the hydrolysis of low viscosity wheat and oat spelt arabinoxylans and about 9 and 5 % from bagasse and bamboo arabinoglucuronoxylans, respectively, that led to the formation of the hydrogels. Therefore, the constructed A. niger D15 [abfB] strain presented a microbial system for the production of recombinant AbfB with the required purity for the modification of xylans into hydrogels."

"19330088","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum clade pathogens cause Fusarium head blight (FHB) or scab of wheat and other small cereal grains, producing different kinds of trichothecene mycotoxins that are detrimental to human and domestic animals. Type B trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol, 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-AcDON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-AcDON) and nivalenol (NIV) are the principal Fusarium mycotoxins reported in China, as well as in other countries. A genomic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to predict chemotypes was developed based on the structural gene sequences of Tri13 genes involved in trichothecene mycotoxin biosynthesis pathways. A single pair of primers derived from the Tri13 genes detected a 583 bp fragment from 15-AcDON-chemotypes, a 644 bp fragment from 3-AcDON-chemotypes and an 859 bp fragment from NIV-producing strains. Fusarium strains from China, Nepal, USA and Europe were identified by this method, revealing their mycotoxin chemotypes identical to that obtained by chemical analyses of HPLC or GC/MS and other PCR assays. The mycotoxin chemotype-specific fragments were amplified from a highly variable region located in Tri13 genes with three deletions for 15-AcDON-chemotypes, two deletions for 3-AcDON-chemotypes and no deletion for NIV-producers. This PCR assay generated a single amplicon and thus should be more reliable than other PCR-based assays that showed the absence or presence of a PCR fragment since these assays may generate false-negative results. The results with strains from several different countries as well as from different hosts further indicated that this method should be globally applicable. This is a rapid, reliable and cost-effective method for the identification of type B trichothecene mycotoxin chemotypes in Fusarium species and food safety controls."

"19322647","abstracttext","The Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) is one of the limiting factors affecting papaya and cucurbits production worldwide. PRSV belongs to the potyvirus genus which consists of 30% of known plant viruses. Two serological closely related strains, namely type-P and -W, have been reported. PRSV type-P infects both papaya and cucurbits, while type-W infects only cucurbits. The genome of PRSV Thailand isolate consists of a (+) RNA molecule of 10323 nucleotides, which is first translated into a single polypeptide and further cleaved by three viral encoded proteases into ten gene products. Helper-component proteinase (HC-Pro), which is encoded by the 2nd cistron of the potyviral genome, has been implicated in aphid transmission, viral movement, viral replication and suppression of host viral defense system. Studies of the Tobacco etch virus (TEV), Lettuce mosaic virus (LMV), Onion yellow dwarf virus (OYDV) and Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) indicate that the N-terminal of HC-Pro is dispensable for systemic infection in their respective hosts. However, deletion analysis of the Tobacco vein mottling virus (TVMV) indicates otherwise. In this study, we examined whether HC-Pro is essential for PRSV systemic infection in cucurbits and the role of its N-terminal in systemic infection. Our results indicated that HC-Pro is indispensable for PRSV infection in zucchini. Deletion analysis of PRSV HC-Pro showed that deletion of as few as 54 amino acids at the N-terminal of HC-Pro completely abolished the infectivity of the corresponding cDNA clone. Therefore, it is proposed that the N-terminal of HC-Pro is involved in systemic infection of PRSV, in addition to its conserved function in aphid transmission."

"19508366","abstracttext","Hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) plays a key role in the regulation of plant responses to various environmental stresses and modulates the expression of related genes including those encoding antioxidant enzymes. A wheat oxalate oxidase (OxO) gene was transformed and expressed in tobacco for production of H(2)O(2). The transgenic plants exhibited enhanced OxO activities and H(2)O(2) concentrations, which was blocked by inhibitors of OxO. The transgenic plants showed increased tolerance to methyl viologen (MV) or high light-induced oxidative stress in both short-time and long-time tests by measuring their maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F(v)/F(m)), ion leakage and malondialdehyde. Higher activities and transcripts of antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase) were observed in the transgenic plants compared to their wild-type controls under normal growth conditions. Pretreatments with inhibitors of OxO and scavenger of H(2)O(2) blocked the increase of tolerance to MV-induced or high light-induced oxidative stress, as well as the induction of antioxidant enzyme activities. Pretreatments with H(2)O(2) increased tolerance to oxidative stresses and antioxidant enzyme activities. It is suggested that H(2)O(2) produced by OxO in the transgenic tobacco plants triggers the signaling pathways to upregulate expressions of antioxidant enzyme genes, which in turn results in the increase of tolerance to MV-induced and high light-induced oxidative stresses."

"19490502","abstracttext","Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), genetically modified with the Al(3+) resistance gene of wheat (TaALMT1), was compared with a non-transformed sibling line when grown on an acidic and highly phosphate-fixing ferrosol supplied with a range of phosphorus concentrations. In short-term pot trials (26 days), transgenic barley expressing TaALMT1 (GP-ALMT1) was more efficient than a non-transformed sibling line (GP) at taking up phosphorus on acid soil, but the genotypes did not differ when the soil was limed. Differences in phosphorus uptake efficiency on acid soil could be attributed not only to the differential effects of aluminium toxicity on root growth between the genotypes, but also to differences in phosphorus uptake per unit root length. Although GP-ALMT1 out-performed GP on acid soil, it was still not as efficient at taking up phosphorus as plants grown on limed soil. GP-ALMT1 plants grown in acid soil possessed substantially smaller rhizosheaths than those grown in limed soil, suggesting that root hairs were shorter. This is a probable reason for the lower phosphorus uptake efficiency. When grown to maturity in large pots, GP-ALMT1 plants produced more than twice the grain as GP plants grown on acid soil and 80% of the grain produced by limed controls. Expression of TaALMT1 in barley was not associated with a penalty in either total shoot or grain production in the absence of Al(3+), with both genotypes showing equivalent yields in limed soil. These findings demonstrate that an important crop species can be genetically engineered to successfully increase grain production on an acid soil."

"19367106","abstracttext","In the 1980s, Japan proposed the terminology of 'functional food' and its concept [1], and since then the importance of conducting basic and applied studies on food functionality has been emphasized globally. Functional foods in particular as well as common foods in general are constituted with a variety of components including functional factors, and it has been recognized as difficult to evaluate their functionalities by usual chemical, biochemical and physiological methodologies [2]. Against this backdrop, nutrigenomics came into being as a new method of evaluating functional foods, as well as nutrients, in a holistic manner. Meanwhile the endowed chair, Functional Food Genomics, was established at the University of Tokyo with the aegis of 32 food companies in Japan. This academia-industry collaboration has been working well to disclose why and how some particular functional foods elicit their effects in the body. These include soy protein isolate, cocoa polyphenol, sesamin as a lignan of sesame origin, and many others. On the other hand, food safety has been gaining public attention, and we applied genomics for assessment of the wholesomeness of newly developed hypoallergenic wheat flour compared with normal flour. The application of this way of holistic evaluation suggested that the new product was basically the same as the normal product in terms of all-gene expression profiles. The same method was applied to a new sweet protein, neoculin, which resembled toxic lectins in conformation. The result indicated that neoculin had lost its lectin activity, possessing no particular toxic effect. It is thus likely that genomics can be applied to a variety of foods in general for the purpose of simultaneously assessing their functionality."

"19455180","abstracttext","A high-resolution transcript linkage map of barley was created using a single doubled haploid (DH) mapping population, only 3'-end expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and only PCR-based assays. Cultivar 'Haruna Nijo' and an ancestral wild-form accession 'H602' were used as EST donors and crossing parents of the mapping population. Of the 10,366 primer sets developed from a non-redundant set of 3'EST sequences, 7700 sets generated useful amplicons and 3975 (52%) showed polymorphisms between the mapping parents. Of these, 2890 (28% of the total) were mapped by single nucleotide polymorphisms (1717), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (933) and INDELs (240). The present work involves an estimated 9% of the genes of barley. Of the mapped ESTs, 2689 (93%) are formatted in the Affymetrix Barley 1 GeneChip and full-length cDNA sequences are available for 1039 (36%). Mapped ESTs show highest similarity with sequences in the wheat gene index (93%) and moderate similarity with rice (50%). Comparison of mapped EST positions and the rice pseudomolecule indicated collinear regions between two species; these are particularly conserved for the entire barley chromosome 3H and rice chromosome 1. These mapped genes, together with a systematically developed set of genetic resources, will make it easier to directly clone genes showing simple inheritance and to determine the genetic basis of complex traits. The information will contribute to the development of a framework for the physical mapping of barley, which is necessary for genome sequencing."

"21081075","abstracttext","The solid component of the tectorial membrane (TM) is a porous matrix made up of the radial collagen fibers and the striated sheet matrix. The striated sheet matrix is believed to contribute to shear impedance in both the radial and longitudinal directions, but the molecular mechanisms involved have not been determined. A missense mutation in Tecta, a gene that encodes for the α-tectorin protein in the striated sheet matrix, causes a 60-dB threshold shift in mice with relatively little reduction in outer hair cell amplification. Here, we show that this threshold shift is coupled to changes in shear impedance, response to osmotic pressure, and concentration of fixed charge of the TM. In Tecta(Y)(1870C/+) mice, the tectorin content of the TM was reduced, as was the content of glycoconjugates reacting with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin. Charge measurements showed a decrease in fixed charge concentration from -6.4±1.4 mmol/L in wild-types to -2.1±0.7 mmol/L in Tecta(Y)(1870C/+) TMs. TMs from Tecta(Y)(1870C/+) mice showed little volume change in response to osmotic pressure compared to those of wild-type mice. The magnitude of both radial and longitudinal TM shear impedance was reduced by 10±1.6 dB in Tecta(Y)(1870C/+) mice. However, the phase of shear impedance was unchanged. These changes are consistent with an increase in the porosity of the TM and a corresponding decrease of the solid fraction. Mechanisms by which these changes can affect the coupling between outer and inner hair cells are discussed."

"21074448","abstracttext","The expression of NMT (3-aminomethylindole/N-methyl-3-aminomethylindole N-methyltransferase; EC 2.1.1.), involved in the biosynthesis of the indole alkaloid gramine, was investigated in aphid-infested barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). NMT is induced by methyl jasmonate and it was hypothesized that the gene would be more strongly upregulated in aphid-resistant barley. We examined the effects of feeding by three aphid species; Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia Mordvilko), rose-grain aphid (Metopolophium dirhodum Walker) and bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) on barley genotypes with varying resistance characteristics. The barley genotypes selected included the cultivar Libra, known to upregulate gramine after feeding by Schizaphis graminum. Infestation by R. padi and M. dirhodum resulted in higher NMT expression in the doubled haploid line 5172-28:4 (DH28:4), which has moderate resistance against R. padi, but not in other aphid-barley combinations. None of the aphid-plant combinations had however increased gramine, suggesting that aphid-induction of gramine is specific to S. graminum. The increased abundance of NMT transcript in aphid-infested DH28:4 did not lead to higher amounts of NMT protein or NMT enzyme activity, neither did 200 times upregulation of NMT transcript in cotyledons incubated with methyl jasmonate, illustrating that even large differences measured at transcript level may have no metabolic consequences. Drought stress or treatments with abscisic acid did lead to higher gramine concentrations in several barley cultivars, but without any concomitant increase of NMT transcripts. Thus, the regulation of the biosynthetic pathway to gramine at transcript and metabolite level diverges during two different stress conditions."

"21041372","abstracttext","Association mapping was used to dissect the genetic basis of drought-adaptive traits and grain yield (GY) in a collection of 189 elite durum wheat accessions evaluated in 15 environments highly different for water availability during the crop cycle (from 146 to 711 mm) and GY (from 9.9 to 67.3 q ha(-1)). For highly heritable traits (e.g. heading date, kernel weight, etc.) several significant experiment-wise marker-trait associations were detected across five or more (up to 13 for kernel weight) environments, with R(2) values ranging from ca. 5 to 10%. As to GY, significant associations (R(2) from 2.5 to 4.2%) were mostly detected in one environment only (56 markers), while decreasing rapidly from two to five environments (from 20 to three markers, respectively) and with only one marker (Xbarc197 on chr. 5A) found significant in six environments (ranging from low- to high-yielding). These results are probably due to the complex genetic basis of GY and its interaction with environmental conditions. The number of markers significantly affecting GY decreased considerably under drought conditions, suggesting a limited effectiveness of association mapping to identify loci for GY under low-moisture conditions, most likely because different genotypes can attain similar phenotypes via different morpho-physiological traits and corresponding gene networks. Our study confirmed the role of major loci for phenology previously described in biparental mapping populations, highlighted a novel set of loci for drought-adaptive traits, and provided information on the agronomic value of the alleles at such loci across a broad range of soil moisture conditions."

"20798930","abstracttext","The trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is produced in wheat, barley and corn following infestation by the fungus Fusarium in the field and during storage. Colloquially known as ""vomitoxin"" because of its emetic effects in pigs, DON has been associated with human gastroenteritis. Since DON is commonly detected in cereal foods, there are significant questions regarding the risks of acute poisoning and chronic effects posed to persons ingesting this trichothecene. A further challenge is how to best manage perceived risks without rendering critical food staples unavailable to an ever-expanding world population. In experimental animal models, acute DON poisoning causes emesis, whereas chronic low-dose exposure elicits anorexia, growth retardation, immunotoxicity as well as impaired reproduction and development resulting from maternal toxicity. Pathophysiologic effects associated with DON include altered neuroendocrine signaling, proinflammatory gene induction, disruption of the growth hormone axis, and altered gut integrity. At the cellular level, DON induces ribotoxic stress thereby disrupting macromolecule synthesis, cell signaling, differentiation, proliferation, and death. There is a need to better understand the mechanistic linkages between these early dose-dependent molecular effects and relevant pathological sequelae. Epidemiological studies are needed to determine if relationships exist between consumption of high DON levels and incidence of both gastroenteritis and potential chronic diseases. From the perspective of human health translation, a particularly exciting development is the availability of biomarkers of exposure (e.g. DON glucuronide) and effect (e.g. IGF1) now make it possible to study the relationship between DON consumption and growth retardation in susceptible human populations such as children and vegetarians. Ultimately, a fusion of basic and translational research is needed to validate or refine existing risk assessments and regulatory standards for this common mycotoxin."
"20661732","articletitle","Celiac disease: how complicated can it get?"
"20661732","abstracttext","In the small intestine of celiac disease patients, dietary wheat gluten and similar proteins in barley and rye trigger an inflammatory response. While strict adherence to a gluten-free diet induces full recovery in most patients, a small percentage of patients fail to recover. In a subset of these refractory celiac disease patients, an (aberrant) oligoclonal intraepithelial lymphocyte population develops into overt lymphoma. Celiac disease is strongly associated with HLA-DQ2 and/or HLA-DQ8, as both genotypes predispose for disease development. This association can be explained by the fact that gluten peptides can be presented in HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 molecules on antigen presenting cells. Gluten-specific CD4(+) T cells in the lamina propria respond to these peptides, and this likely enhances cytotoxicity of intraepithelial lymphocytes against the intestinal epithelium. We propose a threshold model for the development of celiac disease, in which the efficiency of gluten presentation to CD4(+) T cells determines the likelihood of developing celiac disease and its complications. Key factors that influence the efficiency of gluten presentation include: (1) the level of gluten intake, (2) the enzyme tissue transglutaminase 2 which modifies gluten into high affinity binding peptides for HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, (3) the HLA-DQ type, as HLA-DQ2 binds a wider range of gluten peptides than HLA-DQ8, (4) the gene dose of HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8, and finally,(5) additional genetic polymorphisms that may influence T cell reactivity. This threshold model might also help to understand the development of refractory celiac disease and lymphoma."

"21147925","abstracttext","Understanding the genetics underlying host range differences among plant virus strains can provide valuable insights into viral gene functions and virus-host interactions. In this study, we examined viral determinants and mechanisms of differential infection of Zea mays inbred line SDp2 by Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) isolates. WSMV isolates Sidney 81 (WSMV-S81) and Type (WSMV-T) share 98.7% polyprotein sequence identity but differentially infect SDp2: WSMV-S81 induces a systemic infection, but WSMV-T does not. Coinoculation and sequential inoculation of SDp2 with WSMV-T and/or WSMV-S81 did not affect systemic infection by WSMV-S81, suggesting that WSMV-T does not induce a restrictive defense response but that virus-encoded proteins may be involved in differential infection of SDp2. The viral determinant responsible for strain-specific host range was mapped to the N terminus of coat protein (CP) by systematic exchanges of WSMV-S81 sequences with those of WSMV-T and by reciprocal exchanges of CP or CP codons 1 to 74. Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged WSMV-S81 with CP or CP residues 1 to 74 from WSMV-T produced similar numbers of infection foci and genomic RNAs and formed virions in inoculated leaves as those produced with WSMV-S81, indicating that failure to infect SDp2 systemically is not due to defects in replication, cell-to-cell movement, or virion assembly. However, these GFP-tagged hybrids showed profound defects in long-distance transport of virus through the phloem. Furthermore, we found that four of the five differing amino acids in the N terminus of CP between the WSMV-S81 and WSMV-T isolates were collectively involved in systemic infection of SDp2. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the N-terminal region of tritimoviral CP functions in host- and strain-specific long-distance movement."

Additionally, phenotypic properties, such as substrate metabolism profiles as determined by a Biolog GN2 assay and cell-wall fatty acid profiles, particularly contents of the fatty acids C(16 : 0), C(16 : 1)ω7c/t, C(17 : 0), C(17 : 0) cyclo, C(18 : 0) cyclo and C(19 : 0) cyclo, facilitated the differentiation of the newly isolated strain N35(T) from its closest relatives. The isolate underwent phenotypic variation at high frequency in laboratory media. The DNA G+C content was 64.9 mol%. We propose that strain N35(T) is classified as a representative of a novel species within the genus Acidovorax, and suggest the name Acidovorax radicis sp. nov.

"21029322","abstracttext","Quantitative resistance is generally controlled by several genes. More than 100 resistance quantitative trait loci (QTLs) have been identified in wheat and barley against Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Gibberella zeae (anamorph: Fusarium graminearum), implying the possible occurrence of several resistance mechanisms. The objective of this study was to apply metabolomics to identify the metabolites in barley that are related to resistance against FHB. Barley genotypes, Chevron and Stander, were inoculated with mock or pathogen during the anthesis stage. The disease severity was assessed as the proportion of spikelets diseased. The genotype Chevron (0.33) was found to have a higher level of quantitative resistance than Stander (0.88). Spikelet samples were harvested at 48 h post-inoculation; metabolites were extracted and analysed using an LC-ESI-LTQ-Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA). The output was imported to an XCMS 1.12.1 platform, the peaks were deconvoluted and the adducts were sieved. Of the 1826 peaks retained, a t-test identified 496 metabolites with significant treatment effects. Among these, 194 were resistance-related (RR) constitutive metabolites, whose abundance was higher in resistant mock-inoculated than in susceptible mock-inoculated genotypes. Fifty metabolites were assigned putative names on the basis of accurate mass, fragmentation pattern and number of carbons in the formula. The RR metabolites mainly belonged to phenylpropanoid, flavonoid, fatty acid and terpenoid metabolic pathways. Selected RR metabolites were assayed in vitro for antifungal activity on the basis of fungal biomass production. The application of these RR metabolites as potential biomarkers for screening and the potential of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics for the identification of gene functions are discussed."

"21421569","abstracttext","We have previously reported that transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing the wheat dehydrin DHN-5 show enhanced tolerance to osmotic stresses. In order to understand the mechanisms through which DHN-5 exerts this effect, we performed transcriptome profiling using the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray. Our data show an altered expression of 77 genes involved mainly in transcriptional regulation, cellular metabolism, stress tolerance and signaling. Among the up-regulated genes, we identified those which are known to be stress-related genes. Several late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) genes, ABA/stress-related genes (such as RD29B) and those involved in pathogen responses (PR genes) are among the most up-regulated genes. In addition, the MDHAR gene involved in the ascorbate biosynthetic pathway was also up-regulated. This up-regulation was correlated with higher ascorbate content in two dehydrin transgenic lines. In agreement with this result and as ascorbate is known to be an antioxidant, we found that both transgenic lines show enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress caused by H₂O₂. On the other hand, multiple types of transcription factors constitute the largest group of the down-regulated genes. Moreover, three members of the jasmonate-ZIM domain (JAZ) proteins which are negative regulators of jasmonate signaling were severely down-regulated. Interestingly, the dehydrin-overexpressing lines exhibit less sensitivity to jasmonate than wild-type plants and changes in regulation of jasmonate-responsive genes, in a manner similar to that in the jasmonate-insensitive jai3-1 mutant. Altogether, our data unravel the potential pleiotropic effects of DHN-5 on both abiotic and biotic stress responses in Arabidopsis."

"21482579","abstracttext","In many temperate plant species, prolonged cold treatment, known as vernalization, is one of the most critical steps in the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive stage. In contrast to recent advances in understanding the molecular basis of vernalization in Arabidopsis non-vernalization mutants or the spring growth habits of cereal crops such as wheat and barley, natural variations in winter growth habits and their geographic distribution are poorly understood. We analyzed varietal variation and the geographic distribution of the degree of vernalization requirements in germplasms of domesticated barley and wild barley collections. We found a biased geographic distribution of vernalization requirements in domesticated barley: Western regions were strongly associated with a higher degree of spring growth habits, and the extreme winter growth habits were localized to Far Eastern regions including China, Korea and Japan. Both wild accessions and domesticated landraces, the regions of distribution of which overlapped each other, mainly belonged to the moderate class of winter growth habit. As a result of quantitative evaluations performed in this study, we provide evidence that the variation in the degree of winter growth habit in recombinant inbred lines was controlled by quantitative trait loci including three vernalization genes (VRN1, VRN2 and VRN3) that account for 37.9% of the variation in vernalization requirements, with unknown gene(s) explaining the remaining two-thirds of the variation. This evidence implied that the Far Eastern accessions might be a genetically differentiated group derived for an evolutionary reason, resulting in their greater tendency towards a winter growth habit."

The transfer of chromosomes and chromosome segments between related species (chromosome engineering or alien introgression) also provides an important resource for determining the genetic control of target traits. However, the realization of the full potential of chromosome engineering has previously been hampered by the inability to identify and characterize interspecific introgressions accurately."

"21534568","abstracttext","Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, a polychlorinated biphenyl-degrading soil bacterium whose genome has been sequenced, shows lignin degrading activity in two recently developed spectrophotometric assays. Bioinformatic analysis reveals two unannotated peroxidase genes present in the genome of R. jostii RHA1 with sequence similarity to open reading frames in other lignin-degrading microbes. They are members of the Dyp peroxidase family and were annotated as DypA and DypB, on the basis of bioinformatic analysis. Assay of gene deletion mutants using a colorimetric lignin degradation assay reveals that a ΔdypB mutant shows greatly reduced lignin degradation activity, consistent with a role in lignin breakdown. Recombinant DypB protein shows activity in the colorimetric assay and shows Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior using Kraft lignin as a substrate. DypB is activated by Mn(2+) by 5-23-fold using a range of assay substrates, and breakdown of wheat straw lignocellulose by recombinant DypB is observed over 24-48 h in the presence of 1 mM MnCl(2). Incubation of recombinant DypB with a β-aryl ether lignin model compound shows time-dependent turnover, giving vanillin as a product, indicating that C(α)-C(β) bond cleavage has taken place. This reaction is inhibited by addition of diaphorase, consistent with a radical mechanism for C-C bond cleavage. Stopped-flow kinetic analysis of the DypB-catalyzed reaction shows reaction between the intermediate compound I (397 nm) and either Mn(II) (k(obs) = 2.35 s(-1)) or the β-aryl ether (k(obs) = 3.10 s(-1)), in the latter case also showing a transient at 417 nm, consistent with a compound II intermediate. These results indicate that DypB has a significant role in lignin degradation in R. jostii RHA1, is able to oxidize both polymeric lignin and a lignin model compound, and appears to have both Mn(II) and lignin oxidation sites. This is the first detailed characterization of a recombinant bacterial lignin peroxidase."

"21477822","abstracttext","Protein phosphorylation is one of the main process in the signal transduction pathway. In recent years, there has been increasing attention to plant phosphorylation signaling and many laboratories are trying to elucidate pathways using various approaches. Although more than 1000 protein kinase (PK) genes have been annotated in the Arabidopsis genome, biochemical characterization of those PKs is limited. In this work, we demonstrate high-throughput profiling of serine/threonine autophosphorylation activity by a combination of the 759N-terminal biotinylated proteins library, produced using a wheat germ cell-free protein production system, and a commercially available luminescence system. Luminescent analysis revealed that 179 of the 759 PKs had autophosphorylation activity. From these 179 PKs, 67 of the most active PKs were analyzed to determine their function using the PlantP database. This analysis revealed that 35 (53%) of the proteins were classified as non-transmembrane protein kinases, and 15 (23%) were receptor-like protein kinases. Additionally, PKs from Group 4.4-MAP3K, Group 1.6, Group 4.5-MAPK/CDC/CK2/GSK kinases and Group 1.10-receptor like cytoplasmic kinases contained the highest percentage of autophosphorylated activity. Next, to get a better overview of the annotated 67 PKs, we used the gene ontology annotation search on the TAIR website to classify the 67 PKs into functional category. As a result, some of these PKs may be involved in phospho-signaling pathways such as signal transduction, stress response, and the regulation of cell division. Information from this study may shed light on many unknown plant PKs. This study will be a basis for understanding the function of PKs in phosphorylation network for future research."
"21478305","articletitle","Impact of recently emerged sterol 14{alpha}-demethylase (CYP51) variants of Mycosphaerella graminicola on azole fungicide sensitivity."
"21478305","abstracttext","The progressive decline in the effectiveness of some azole fungicides in controlling Mycosphaerella graminicola, causal agent of the damaging Septoria leaf blotch disease of wheat, has been correlated with the selection and spread in the pathogen population of specific mutations in the M. graminicola CYP51 (MgCYP51) gene encoding the azole target sterol 14α-demethylase. Recent studies have suggested that the emergence of novel MgCYP51 variants, often harboring substitution S524T, has contributed to a decrease in the efficacy of prothioconazole and epoxiconazole, the two currently most effective azole fungicides against M. graminicola. In this study, we establish which amino acid alterations in novel MgCYP51 variants have the greatest impact on azole sensitivity and protein function. We introduced individual and combinations of identified alterations by site-directed mutagenesis and functionally determined their impact on azole sensitivity by expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant YUG37::erg11 carrying a regulatable promoter controlling native CYP51 expression. We demonstrate that substitution S524T confers decreased sensitivity to all azoles when introduced alone or in combination with Y461S. In addition, S524T restores the function in S. cerevisiae of MgCYP51 variants carrying the otherwise lethal alterations Y137F and V136A. Sensitivity tests of S. cerevisiae transformants expressing recently emerged MgCYP51 variants carrying combinations of alterations D134G, V136A, Y461S, and S524T reveal a substantial impact on sensitivity to the currently most widely used azoles, including epoxiconazole and prothioconazole. Finally, we exploit a recently developed model of the MgCYP51 protein to predict that the substantial structural changes caused by these novel combinations reduce azole interactions with critical residues in the binding cavity, thereby causing resistance."
"21734379","articletitle","Nutritional influences in selected gastrointestinal diseases."
"21734379","abstracttext","Nutritional factors, as sources of luminal antigens, have been thought to be important factors in the immunopathogenesis of numerous gastrointestinal diseases. In some diseases, the role of the nutritional component is causal in the susceptible host. Such diseases include celiac disease, a common heritable chronic inflammatory condition of the small intestine induced by dietary wheat, rye and barley, in susceptible individuals. Specific HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 risk alleles are necessary, but not sufficient, for disease development. The well-defined role of HLA-DQ heterodimers encoded by these alleles is to present cereal peptides to CD4+ T cells, activating an inflammatory immune response in the intestine. Genome-wide association studies have been performed which identified the IL2-IL21 risk locus and other genes with immune functions and key roles in thymic T-cell selection. Another example for this group is Wilson's disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation of the ATP7B gene, resulting in a defect of biliary copper excretion and toxic accumulation in the body, especially in the liver, brain and cornea, resulting in hepatic and/or neurological symptoms. In other diseases, however, the association is less well established. In such endeavor, epidemiological observations may become a valuable part of the overall investigations aimed at identifying dietary factors, which are involved in the initiation and perpetuation of the specific disease. As an example, relationships between nutrition and colorectal cancer have been hypothesized early on (e.g. folate, calcium, vitamin D, red meat). Similarly, intake of certain diet constituents like fat, refined sugar, fruits, vegetables and fiber was reported to be associated with the expression of inflammatory bowel diseases. In addition, in children with active Crohn's disease, enteral nutrition was found to be equally effective as corticosteroids in induction of remission, with mucosal healing induced by downregulation of mucosal pro-inflammatory cytokine profiles in both the ileum and the colon after enteral nutrition. However, the particular effect of the consumption of each type of food remains questionable in most cases, at least in part because of insufficient data and serious methodological limitations (e.g. recall bias, heterogeneity between collected data, lack of correction for covariates, difficulties in double blinding)."

"21693664","abstracttext_background and aims","Gluten proteins are the major storage protein fraction in the mature wheat grain. They are restricted to the starchy endosperm, which forms white flour on milling, and interact during grain development to form large polymers which form a continuous proteinaceous network when flour is mixed with water to give dough. This network confers viscosity and elasticity to the dough, enabling the production of leavened products. The starchy endosperm is not a homogeneous tissue and quantitative and qualitative gradients exist for the major components: protein, starch and cell wall polysaccharides. Gradients in protein content and composition are the most evident and are of particular interest because of the major role played by the gluten proteins in determining grain processing quality."

"21695540","abstracttext","There have been numerous developments in ethanol fermentation technology since the beginning of the new millennium as ethanol has become an immediate viable alternative to fast-depleting crude reserves as well as increasing concerns over environmental pollution. Nowadays, although most research efforts are focused on the conversion of cheap cellulosic substrates to ethanol, methods that are cost-competitive with gasoline production are still lacking. At the same time, the ethanol industry has engaged in implementing potential energy-saving, productivity and efficiency-maximizing technologies in existing production methods to become more viable. Very high gravity (VHG) fermentation is an emerging, versatile one among such technologies offering great savings in process water and energy requirements through fermentation of higher concentrations of sugar substrate and, therefore, increased final ethanol concentration in the medium. The technology also allows increased fermentation efficiency, without major alterations to existing facilities, by efficient utilization of fermentor space and elimination of known losses. This comprehensive research update on VHG technology is presented in two main sections, namely VHG brewing, wherein the effects of nutrients supplementation, yeast pitching rate, flavour compound synthesis and foam stability under increased wort gravities are discussed; and VHG bioethanol fermentation studies. In the latter section, aspects related to the role of osmoprotectants and nutrients in yeast stress reduction, substrates utilized/tested so far, including saccharide (glucose, sucrose, molasses, etc.) and starchy materials (wheat, corn, barley, oats, etc.), and mash viscosity issues in VHG bioethanol production are detailed. Thereafter, topics common to both areas such as process optimization studies, mutants and gene level studies, immobilized yeast applications, temperature effect, reserve carbohydrates profile in yeast, and economic aspects are discussed and future prospects are summarized."

"21707638","abstracttext","The micronutrient content of most cereal grains is low and responsible for malnutrition deficiencies in millions of people who rely on grains as their primary food source. Any strategy that can increase the micronutrient content of grain will have significant benefits to world health. We identified a gene from barley encoding a cell wall protein with multiple histidine (His)-rich motifs interspersed with short arabinogalactan-protein (AGP) domains and have called it Hordeum vulgare His-rich AGP (HvHRA1). Sequence analysis shows that His-rich AGPs are rare in plants and that the number of His-rich and AGP domains differ between cereals and dicots. The barley and wheat encoded proteins have more than 13 His-rich domains, whereas the putative rice orthologue has only 5 His-rich regions. His-rich motifs are well-established metal-binding motifs; therefore, we developed transgenic (Tx) rice plants that constitutively overexpress barley HvHRA1. There was no significant effect on plant growth or grain yield in Tx plants. Purification of AGPs from wild-type and Tx plants showed that only Tx plants contained detectable levels of a His-rich AGP. Calcein assay shows that the AGP fraction from Tx plants had increased binding affinity for Cu(2+) . Micronutrient analysis of brown and white rice showed that the grain nutrient yield for Fe, Zn and Cu was higher in two Tx lines compared to their respective nulls, although the differences were not statistically significant. This approach highlights the potential of the plant apoplast (cell wall) for storage of key nutrients through overexpression of genes for metal-binding proteins."

Despite the reduced molecular weight of naturally occurring soluble (1--->3),(1--->4)-β-d-glucan (β-glucan) caused by the bread-making process, whole grain barley breads downregulated hepatic expression of CYP7A1 and HMG-CoAR genes that are responsible for bile acid and cholesterol synthesis, suggesting a possible role of bioactive compounds such as short-chain fatty acids and phenolic compounds from barley bread. Barley bread enriched with HPMC downregulated expression of ABCG5 gene. Taken together, it appears that distinctive modulation of synthesis and excretion of hepatic cholesterol and bile acid contributes to the cholesterol-lowering properties of whole grain barley breads and breads enriched with HPMC. These data suggests that alternative whole grain breads supplemented with HPMC may provide consumers with a staple food that can assist in cholesterol management."
"21791197","articletitle","Photochemical characterization of a novel fungal rhodopsin from Phaeosphaeria nodorum."
"21791197","abstracttext","Eukaryotic microbial rhodopsins are widespread bacteriorhodopsin-like proteins found in many lower eukaryotic groups including fungi. Many fungi contain multiple rhodopsins, some significantly diverged from the original bacteriorhodopsin template. Although few fungal rhodopsins have been studied biophysically, both fast-cycling light-driven proton pumps and slow-cycling photosensors have been found. The purpose of this study was to characterize photochemically a new subgroup of fungal rhodopsins, the so-called auxiliary group. The study used the two known rhodopsin genes from the fungal wheat pathogen, Phaeosphaeria nodorum. One of the genes is a member of the auxiliary group while the other is highly similar to previously characterized proton-pumping Leptosphaeria rhodopsin. Auxiliary rhodopsin genes from a range of species form a distinct group with a unique primary structure and are located in carotenoid biosynthesis gene cluster. Amino acid conservation pattern suggests that auxiliary rhodopsins retain the transmembrane core of bacteriorhodopsins, including all residues important for proton transport, but have unique polar intramembrane residues. Spectroscopic characterization of the two yeast-expressed Phaeosphaeria rhodopsins showed many similarities: absorption spectra, conformation of the retinal chromophore, fast photocycling, and carboxylic acid protonation changes. It is likely that both Phaeosphaeria rhodopsins are proton-pumping, at least in vitro. We suggest that auxiliary rhodopsins have separated from their ancestors fairly recently and have acquired the ability to interact with as yet unidentified transducers, performing a photosensory function without changing their spectral properties and basic photochemistry."

"22076248","abstracttext","Expansin protein is a component of the cell wall generally accepted to be the key regulator of cell wall extension during plant growth. Plant hormones regulate expansin gene expression as well as plant growth during drought stress. However, the relationship between expansin and plant hormone is far from clear. Here, we studied the involvement of expansin in plant cell growth mediated by the hormones indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA) under osmotic stress which was induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG)-6000. Wheat coleoptiles from a drought-resistant cultivar HF9703 and a drought-sensitive cultivar 921842 were used to evaluate cell growth and expansin activity. Osmotic stress induced the accumulation of ABA. ABA induced expansin activity mainly by enhancing expansin expression, since ABA induced cell wall basification via decreasing plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase activity, which was unfavorable for expansin activity. Although ABA induced expansin activity and cell wall extension, treatment with exogenous ABA and/or fluridone (FLU, an ABA inhibitor) suggested that ABA was involved in the coleoptile growth inhibition during osmotic stress. IAA application to detached coleoptiles also enhanced coleoptile growth and increased expansin activity, but unlike ABA, IAA-induced expansin activity was mainly due to the decrease of cell wall pH by increasing plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase activity. Compared with drought-sensitive cultivar, the drought-resistant cultivar could maintain greater expansin activity and cell wall extension, which was contributive to its resultant faster growth under water stress."

"22309969","abstracttext","The migratory endoparasitic root lesion nematode Pratylenchus thornei is a major pest of the cereals wheat and barley. In what we believe to be the first global transcriptome analysis for P. thornei, using Roche GS FLX sequencing, 787,275 reads were assembled into 34,312 contigs using two assembly programs, to yield 6,989 contigs common to both. These contigs were annotated, resulting in functional assignments for 3,048. Specific transcripts studied in more detail included carbohydrate active enzymes potentially involved in cell wall degradation, neuropeptides, putative plant nematode parasitism genes, and transcripts that could be secreted by the nematode. Transcripts for cell wall degrading enzymes were similar to bacterial genes, suggesting that they were acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Contigs matching 14 parasitism genes found in sedentary endoparasitic nematodes were identified. These genes are thought to function in suppression of host defenses and in feeding site development, but their function in P. thornei may differ. Comparison of the common contigs from P. thornei with other nematodes showed that 2,039 were common to sequences of the Heteroderidae, 1,947 to the Meloidogynidae, 1,218 to Radopholus similis, 1,209 matched expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of Pratylenchus penetrans and Pratylenchus vulnus, and 2,940 to contigs of Pratylenchus coffeae. There were 2,014 contigs common to Caenarhabditis elegans, with 15.9% being common to all three groups. Twelve percent of contigs with matches to the Heteroderidae and the Meloidogynidae had no homology to any C. elegans protein. Fifty-seven percent of the contigs did not match known sequences and some could be unique to P. thornei. These data provide substantial new information on the transcriptome of P. thornei, those genes common to migratory and sedentary endoparasitic nematodes, and provide additional understanding of genes required for different forms of parasitism. The data can also be used to identify potential genes to study host interactions and for crop protection."
"23285127","articletitle","RNA editing in mitochondrial trans-introns is required for splicing."
"23285127","abstracttext","In plant mitochondria, gene expression of translatable mRNAs is a complex process with two critical steps, RNA editing and splicing. We studied the role of RNA editing on non-coding regions of the mat-r-nad1e-nad5c transcript from wheat mitochondria. This RNA contains two trans-introns, 3'-nad1-I4 and 3'-nad5-I2, involved in different trans-splicing events, ensuring the association of nad1d-nad1e and nad5b-nad5c exons from nad1 and nad5 mRNAs respectively. The C-to-U editing changes studied here affect homologous positions on 3'-nad1-I4 and 3'-nad5-I2. It is proposed that these base changes are necessary to place an Adenosine residue in a bulging conformation characteristic of domain VI (D6) from group II introns. In this work, we investigated the role of RNA editing events on 3'-nad1-I4 and 3'-nad5-I2 in the trans-splicing process using in vivo and in organello approaches. When the branched intermediates formed during the splicing process were analyzed, the C residues from D6 intron domains from 3'-nad1-I4 and 3'-nad5-I2 were found changed to U, suggesting that RNA editing of these residues could be mandatory for splicing. This assumption was tested by expressing recombinant mat-r-nad1e transgenes introduced into mitochondria by electroporation. Mutation of the editing target residue dramatically affected trans-splicing. Interestingly, the exon joining efficiency was not recovered by compensatory mutations, suggesting that the role of RNA editing is not confined to the restoration of the secondary structure of domain D6 of the intron. Our results strongly support the hypothesis that RNA editing in trans-introns precedes maturation, and is required for the splicing reaction. In addition, this is the first report using an in organello approach to study the trans-splicing process, opening the way to future studies of this peculiar mechanism."

"23262780","abstracttext","Winter wheat lines can achieve cold acclimation (development of tolerance to freezing temperatures) and vernalization (delay in transition from vegetative to reproductive phase) in response to low non-freezing temperatures. To describe cold-acclimation-specific processes and pathways, we utilized cold acclimation transcriptomic data from two lines varying in freeze survival but not vernalization. These lines, designated freeze-resistant (FR) and freeze-susceptible (FS), were the source of crown tissue RNA. Well-annotated differentially expressed genes (p ≤ 0.005 and fold change ≥ 2 in response to 4 weeks cold acclimation) were used for gene ontology and pathway analysis. ""Abiotic stimuli"" was identified as the most enriched and unique for FR. Unique to FS was ""cytoplasmic components."" Pathway analysis revealed the ""triacylglycerol degradation"" pathway as significantly downregulated and common to both FR and FS. The most enriched of FR pathways was ""neighbors of DREB2A,"" with the highest positive median fold change. The ""13-LOX and 13-HPL"" and the ""E2F"" pathways were enriched in FR only with a negative median fold change. The ""jasmonic acid biosynthesis"" pathway and four ""photosynthetic-associated"" pathways were enriched in both FR and FS but with a more negative median fold change in FR than in FS. A pathway unique to FS was ""binding partners of LHCA1,"" which was enriched only in FS with a significant negative median fold change. We propose that the DREB2A, E2F, jasmonic acid biosynthesis, and photosynthetic pathways are critical for discrimination between cold-acclimated lines varying in freeze survival."

"23161856","abstracttext","Aquaporin (AQP) proteins have been shown to transport water and other small molecules through biological membranes, which is crucial for plants to combat salt stress. However, the precise role of AQP genes in salt stress response is not completely understood in plants. In this study, a PIP1 subgroup AQP gene, designated TaAQP8, was cloned and characterized from wheat. Transient expression of TaAQP8-green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein revealed its localization in the plasma membrane. TaAQP8 exhibited water channel activity in Xenopus laevis oocytes. TaAQP8 transcript was induced by NaCl, ethylene and H(2)O(2). Further investigation showed that up-regulation of TaAQP8 under salt stress involves ethylene and H(2)O(2) signaling, with ethylene causing a positive effect and H(2)O(2) acting as a negative factor. Overexpression of TaAQP8 in tobacco increased root elongation compared with controls under salt stress. The roots of transgenic plants also retained a high K(+)/Na(+) ratio and Ca(2+) content, but reduced H(2)O(2) accumulation by an enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) activities under salt stress. Further investigation showed that whole seedlings from transgenic lines displayed higher SOD, CAT and POD activities, increased NtSOD and NtCAT transcript levels, and decreased H(2)O(2) accumulation and membrane injury under salt stress. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TaAQP8 confers salt stress tolerance not only by retaining high a K(+)/Na(+) ratio and Ca(2+) content, but also by reducing H(2)O(2) accumulation and membrane damage by enhancing the antioxidant system."
"23139637","articletitle","TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) induced by RANKL negatively regulates osteoclasts survival and function."
"23139637","abstracttext","Osteoclasts are the principle bone-resorbing cells. Precise control of balanced osteoclast activity is indispensable for bone homeostasis. Osteoclast activation mediated by RANK-TRAF6 axis has been clearly identified. However, a negative regulation-machinery in osteoclast remains unclear. TRAF family member-associated NF-κB activator (TANK) is induced by about 10 folds during osteoclastogenesis, according to a genome-wide analysis of gene expression before and after osteoclast maturation, and confirmed by western blot and quantitative RT-PCR. Bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) transduced with lentivirus carrying tank-shRNA were induced to form osteoclast in the presence of RANKL and M-CSF. Tank expression was downregulated by 90% by Tank-shRNA, which is confirmed by western blot. Compared with wild-type (WT) cells, osteoclastogenesis of Tank-silenced BMMs was increased, according to tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) stain on day 5 and day 7. Number of bone resorption pits by Tank-silenced osteoclasts was increased by 176% compared with WT cells, as shown by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) stain and scanning electronic microscope (SEM) analysis. Survival rate of Tank-silenced mature osteoclast is also increased. However, acid production of Tank-knockdown cells was not changed compared with control cells. IκBα phosphorylation is increased in tank-silenced cells, indicating that TANK may negatively regulate NF-κB activity in osteoclast. In conclusion, Tank, whose expression is increased during osteoclastogenesis, inhibits osteoclast formation, activity and survival, by regulating NF-κB activity and c-FLIP expression. Tank enrolls itself in a negative feedback loop in bone resorption. These results may provide means for therapeutic intervention in diseases of excessive bone resorption."

"22426509","abstracttext","Isoproturon is the only herbicide that can control Phalaris minor, a competitive weed of wheat that developed resistance in 1992. Resistance against isoproturon was reported to be due to a mutation in the psbA gene that encodes the isoproturon-binding D1 protein. Previously in our laboratory, a triazole derivative of isoproturon (TDI) was synthesized and found to be active against both susceptible and resistant biotypes at 0.5 kg/ha but has shown poor specificity. In the present study, both susceptible D1((S)), resistant D1((R)) and D2 proteins of the PS-II reaction center of P. minor have been modeled and simulated, selecting the crystal structure of PS-II from Thermosynechococcus elongatus (2AXT.pdb) as template. Loop regions were refined, and the complete reaction center D1/D2 was simulated with GROMACS in lipid (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylglycero-3-phosphoglycerol, POPG) environment along with ligands and cofactor. Both S and R models were energy minimized using steepest decent equilibrated with isotropic pressure coupling and temperature coupling using a Berendsen protocol, and subjected to 1,000 ps of MD simulation. As a result of MD simulation, the best model obtained in lipid environment had five chlorophylls, two plastoquinones, two phenophytins and a bicarbonate ion along with cofactor Fe and oxygen evolving center (OEC). The triazole derivative of isoproturon was used as lead molecule for docking. The best worked out conformation of TDI was chosen for receptor-based de novo ligand design. In silico designed molecules were screened and, as a result, only those molecules that show higher docking and binding energies in comparison to isoproturon and its triazole derivative were proposed for synthesis in order to get more potent, non-resistant and more selective TDI analogs."

"22386519","articletitle","Structural organization of the nuclear pore permeability barrier."
"22386519","abstracttext","The efficiency of gene therapy in non-dividing cells is particularly poor due to restricted nuclear delivery rates of exogenously applied macromolecules across the nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). Therefore, improved intranuclear delivery of transgenes requires an ability to modulate the barrier function of the NPC. Despite a large body of experimental evidence accumulated to date, the contribution of individual NPC proteins (nucleoporins) to the formation of the NPC permeability barrier as well as their structural organization within the NPC remains under debate. In the present study, we revisit the view on the spatial arrangement of the Phe-Gly rich domains (FG-domains) of a subset of nucleoporins known as FG-nucleoporins. They are generally believed to be the key constituents of the NPC permeability barrier. Comparison of the binding pattern of a transport receptor importin β fragment, that binds specifically to FG-domains, with the binding pattern of wheat germ agglutinin that binds elsewhere in the NPC, reveals that FG-domains tend to cluster in the very center of the NPC. Furthermore, a controlled sequential release of the barrier-forming nucleoporins results in a gradual breakdown of the NPC permeability barrier. The breakdown is initiated by a dissociation of Nup62 from the NPC. This is accompanied by an increased passive diffusion of small molecules across the NPC. Subsequent dissociation of Nup98 and possibly other nucleoporins results in a collapse of the barrier for larger molecules. We therefore conclude that FG-nucleoporins do not contribute equally to the maintenance of the NPC permeability barrier exclusion limit. This implies that a controlled release of nucleoporins that contribute most to the formation and maintenance of the NPC barrier can facilitate access of therapeutic macromolecules into the nucleus."

"22412898","abstracttext","The tropical maize race Tuxpeño is a well-known race of Mexican dent germplasm which has greatly contributed to the development of tropical and subtropical maize gene pools. In order to investigate how it could be exploited in future maize improvement, a panel of maize germplasm accessions was assembled and characterized using genome-wide Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers. This panel included 321 core accessions of Tuxpeño race from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) germplasm bank collection, 94 CIMMYT maize lines (CMLs) and 54 U.S. Germplasm Enhancement of Maize (GEM) lines. The panel also included other diverse sources of reference germplasm: 14 U.S. maize landrace accessions, 4 temperate inbred lines from the U.S. and China, and 11 CIMMYT populations (a total of 498 entries with 795 plants). Clustering analyses (CA) based on Modified Rogers Distance (MRD) clearly partitioned all 498 entries into their corresponding groups. No sub clusters were observed within the Tuxpeño core set. Various breeding strategies for using the Tuxpeño core set, based on grouping of the studied germplasm and genetic distance among them, were discussed. In order to facilitate sampling diversity within the Tuxpeño core, a minicore subset of 64 Tuxpeño accessions (20% of its usual size) representing the diversity of the core set was developed, using an approach combining phenotypic and molecular data. Untapped diversity represents further use of the Tuxpeño landrace for maize improvement through the core and/or minicore subset available to the maize community."
"22699509","articletitle","Presence of tannins in sorghum grains is conditioned by different natural alleles of Tannin1."
"22699509","abstracttext","Sorghum, an ancient old-world cereal grass, is the dietary staple of over 500 million people in more than 30 countries in the tropics and semitropics. Its C4 photosynthesis, drought resistance, wide adaptation, and high nutritional value hold the promise to alleviate hunger in Africa. Not present in other major cereals, such as rice, wheat, and maize, condensed tannins (proanthocyanidins) in the pigmented testa of some sorghum cultivars have been implicated in reducing protein digestibility but recently have been shown to promote human health because of their high antioxidant capacity and ability to fight obesity through reduced digestion. Combining quantitative trait locus mapping, meta-quantitative trait locus fine-mapping, and association mapping, we showed that the nucleotide polymorphisms in the Tan1 gene, coding a WD40 protein, control the tannin biosynthesis in sorghum. A 1-bp G deletion in the coding region, causing a frame shift and a premature stop codon, led to a nonfunctional allele, tan1-a. Likewise, a different 10-bp insertion resulted in a second nonfunctional allele, tan1-b. Transforming the sorghum Tan1 ORF into a nontannin Arabidopsis mutant restored the tannin phenotype. In addition, reduction in nucleotide diversity from wild sorghum accessions to landraces and cultivars was found at the region that codes the highly conserved WD40 repeat domains and the C-terminal region of the protein. Genetic research in crops, coupled with nutritional and medical research, could open the possibility of producing different levels and combinations of phenolic compounds to promote human health."
"23321705","articletitle","Exploitation of interspecific diversity for monocot crop improvement."
"23321705","abstracttext","In many cultivated crop species there is limited genetic variation available for the development of new higher yielding varieties adapted to climate change and sustainable farming practises. The distant relatives of crop species provide a vast and largely untapped reservoir of genetic variation for a wide range of agronomically important traits that can be exploited by breeders for crop improvement. In this paper, in what we believe to be the largest introgression programme undertaken in the monocots, we describe the transfer of the entire genome of Festuca pratensis into Lolium perenne in overlapping chromosome segments. The L. perenne/F. pratensis introgressions were identified and characterised via 131 simple sequence repeats and 1612 SNPs anchored to the rice genome. Comparative analyses were undertaken to determine the syntenic relationship between L. perenne/F. pratensis and rice, wheat, barley, sorghum and Brachypodium distachyon. Analyses comparing recombination frequency and gene distribution indicated that a large proportion of the genes within the genome are located in the proximal regions of chromosomes which undergo low/very low frequencies of recombination. Thus, it is proposed that past breeding efforts to produce improved varieties have centred on the subset of genes located in the distal regions of chromosomes where recombination is highest. The use of alien introgression for crop improvement is important for meeting the challenges of global food supply and the monocots such as the forage grasses and cereals, together with recent technological advances in molecular biology, can help meet these challenges."

"22654744","abstracttext","We generated transgenic mice in which a trans-synaptic tracer, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), was specifically expressed in the locus coeruleus (LC) neurons under the control of the dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH) gene promoter. WGA protein was produced in more than 95% of the tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive LC neurons sampled. Transynaptic transfer of WGA was most evident in CA3 neurons of the hippocampus, but appeared absent in CA1 neurons. Faint but significant WGA immunoreactivity was observed surrounding the nuclei of dentate granule cells. Putative hilar mossy cells, identified by the presence of calretinin in the ventral hippocampus, appeared uniformly positive for transynaptically transferred WGA protein. GAD67-positive interneurons in the hilar and CA3 regions tended to be WGA-positive, although a subset of them did not show WGA co-localization. The same mixed WGA uptake profile was apparent when examining co-localization with parvalbumin. The selective uptake of WGA by dentate granule cells, mossy cells, and CA3 pyramidal neurons is consistent with evidence for a large proportion of conventional synapses adjacent to LC axonal varicosities in these regions. The lack of WGA uptake in the CA1 region and its relatively sparse innervation by DBH-positive fibers suggest that a majority of the TH-positive classical synapses revealed by electron microscopy in that region may be producing dopamine. The overall pattern of WGA uptake in these transgenic mice implies a selective role for the granule cell-mossy cell-CA3 network in processing novelty or the salient environmental contingency changes signaled by LC activity."

"23203118","abstracttext","P-glycoprotein (P-gp) overexpression is the most frequently observed cause of multidrug resistance in neoplastic cells. In our experiments, P-gp was expressed in L1210 mice leukemia cells (S cells) by selection with vincristine (R cells) or transfection with the gene encoding human P-gp (T cells). Remodeling of cell surface sugars is associated with P-gp expression in L1210 cells as a secondary cellular response. In this study, we monitored the alteration of cell surface saccharides by Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA). Sialic acid is predominantly linked to the surface of S, R and T cells via α-2,6 branched sugars that tightly bind SNA. The presence of sialic acid linked to the cell surface via α-2,3 branched sugars was negligible, and the binding of MAA (recognizing this branch) was much less pronounced than SNA. WGA induced greater cell death than SNA, which was bound to the cell surface and agglutinated all three L1210 cell-variants more effectively than WGA. Thus, the ability of lectins to induce cell death did not correlate with their binding efficiency and agglutination potency. Compared to S cells, P-gp positive R and T cells contain a higher amount of N-acetyl-glucosamine on their cell surface, which is associated with improved WGA binding. Both P-gp positive variants of L1210 cells are strongly resistant to vincristine as P-gp prototypical drug. This resistance could not be altered by liberalization of terminal sialyl residues from the cell surface by sialidase."

"23236356","abstracttext","The Dothideomycete fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola is the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch, a devastating disease of wheat leaves that causes dramatic decreases in yield. Infection involves an initial extended period of symptomless intercellular colonisation prior to the development of visible necrotic disease lesions. Previous functional genomics and gene expression profiling studies have implicated the production of secreted virulence effector proteins as key facilitators of the initial symptomless growth phase. In order to identify additional candidate virulence effectors, we re-analysed and catalogued the predicted protein secretome of M. graminicola isolate IPO323, which is currently regarded as the reference strain for this species. We combined several bioinformatic approaches in order to increase the probability of identifying truly secreted proteins with either a predicted enzymatic function or an as yet unknown function. An initial secretome of 970 proteins was predicted, whilst further stringent selection criteria predicted 492 proteins. Of these, 321 possess some functional annotation, the composition of which may reflect the strictly intercellular growth habit of this pathogen, leaving 171 with no functional annotation. This analysis identified a protein family encoding secreted peroxidases/chloroperoxidases (PF01328) which is expanded within all members of the family Mycosphaerellaceae. Further analyses were done on the non-annotated proteins for size and cysteine content (effector protein hallmarks), and then by studying the distribution of homologues in 17 other sequenced Dothideomycete fungi within an overall total of 91 predicted proteomes from fungal, oomycete and nematode species. This detailed M. graminicola secretome analysis provides the basis for further functional and comparative genomics studies."

"23243236","abstracttext","Folic acid plays a key role in nucleic acids and protein synthesis, and has been associated with anti-inflammatory effects in LPS-induced infections. To this end, a study was conducted to investigate the effects of dietary folic acid (FA) supplementation in older laying hens (58 to 66 wk of age) challenged with Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS). A total of 24 Shaver White laying hens at 58 wk were fed 2 diets. The diets were wheat-soybean-based, with either 0 or 4 mg of supplemental FA per kg of diet. After 8 wk of feeding and at 66 wk, the hens were injected intravenously with 8 mg of LPS or saline per kg of BW. Four hours after injection, blood was collected and hens were euthanized to obtain spleen and cecal tonsils. The T cell subsets in the blood and the spleen (CD4+ and CD8+), total IgG, and biochemical constituents (total protein, albumin, globulin, and fibrinogen) were not influenced (P > 0.05) by dietary FA supplementation. However, LPS injection decreased (P < 0.05) biochemical constituents, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in the blood, whereas CD4+:CD8+ ratio and total IgG increased (P < 0.05), and fibrinogen was not influenced. Gene expression in the spleen and cecal tonsils was not influenced by dietary FA supplementation except a diet × challenge interaction for interleukin (IL)-8 in the spleen; IL-8 decreased in FA-fed hens that were treated with LPS. Also, FA supplementation decreased the expression of IL-8 in cecal tonsils. Relative to saline-injected hens, expression of IL-1β, interferon-γ, and IL-10 increased in the LPS-injected hens in the spleen and cecal tonsils, IL-8 increased in LPS-injected hens only in the cecal tonsils, whereas Toll-like receptor 4, IL-4, IL-17, and IL-18 increased in the LPS-injected hens only in the spleen; however, LPS decreased expression of IL-13 in the cecal tonsils. In conclusion, FA did not affect inflammatory responses in older laying hens; more studies are required to investigate possible protective effects of FA in laying hens."

The neutral linear PEG(1580) was designed as the stalk part to improve the biocompatibility of the vectors. The obtained polymer PEG-poly(AGE-Suc) was further modified by folate (FA) at the distal end to achieve the cell-specific targeting. It was confirmed that the negatively charged FA-PEG-poly(AGE-Suc) could coat the positively charged PEI 25K/DNA complex and form a ternary complex by electrostatic interaction. The addition of FA-PEG-poly(AGE-Suc) could change the positive charge of PEI 25K/DNA complexes to negative with no influence on the diameter. The ternary complex with the coat of FA-PEG-poly(AGE-Suc) could effectively condense DNA and protect it from degradation by DNase I. The nonspecific interaction between PEI 25K/DNA complexes and blood components was also significantly reduced by the addition of anionic PEG. The ternary complex PEI 25K/DNA/FA-PEG-poly(AGE-Suc) exhibited a 12-fold higher transfection efficiency on 293T cells compared to PEI 25K/DNA in the serum-containing medium. The competitive folate inhibition assay demonstrated that the higher transfection efficiency of PEI 25K/DNA/FA-PEG-poly(AGE-Suc) was attributed to the folate molecule conjugated to the distal end of FA-PEG-poly(AGE-Suc). The ternary complex PEI 25k/DNA/FA-PEG-poly(AGE-Suc) with low side effects and high transfection efficiency may be a novel effective gene delivery system."

"22974422","abstracttext","To provide a comprehensive examination of the bacterial diversity in the rumen content of cows fed different diets, high-throughput 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing was used. Four rumen fistulated nonlactating Holstein cows received 12 kg of dry matter per day of four diets based on maize silage during four periods: the low-starch diet (22% starch, 3% fat); the high-starch diet, supplemented with wheat plus barley (35% starch, 3% fat); the low-starch plus oil diet, supplemented with 5% of sunflower oil (20% starch, 7.6% fat) and the high-starch plus oil diet (33% starch, 7.3% fat). Samples were taken after 12 days of adaptation, 5 h postfeeding. Whatever the diet, bacterial community of sieved rumen contents was dominated by Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae, Prevotellaceae, and Rikenellaceae families were highly present and were clearly affected by cow diet. The highest abundance of Prevotellaceae and the lowest abundance of Ruminococcaceae and Rikenellaceae were found with the high-starch plus oil diet. Dietary starch increased the relative abundance of only three genera: Barnesiella, Oribacterium and Olsenella, but decreased the relative abundances of several genera, with very significant effects for Rikenellaceae_RC9 and Butyrivibrio-Pseudobutyrivibrio. Oil alone had a limited effect, but interestingly, starch plus oil addition differently affected the bacterial populations compared to starch addition without oil."

"22976391","abstracttext","The photoperiod sensitivity gene Ppd-1 influences the timing of flowering in temperate cereals such as wheat and barley. The effect of Ppd-1 on the expression of flowering-time genes was assessed by examining the expression levels of the vernalization genes VRN1 and VRN3/WFT and of two CONSTANS-like genes, WCO1 and TaHd1, during vegetative and reproductive growth stages. Two near-isogenic lines (NILs) were used: the first carried a photoperiod-insensitive allele of Ppd-1 (Ppd-1a-NIL), the other, a photoperiod-sensitive allele (Ppd-1b-NIL). We found that the expression pattern of VRN1 was similar in Ppd-1a-NIL and Ppd-1b-NIL plants, suggesting that VRN1 is not regulated by Ppd-1. Under long day conditions, VRN3/WFT showed similar expression patterns in Ppd-1a-NIL and Ppd-1b-NIL plants. However, expression differed greatly under short day conditions: VRN3/WFT expression was detected in Ppd-1a-NIL plants at the 5-leaf stage when they transited from vegetative to reproductive growth; very low expression was present in Ppd-1b-NIL throughout all growth stages. Thus, the Ppd-1b allele acts to down-regulate VRN3/WFT under short day conditions. WCO1 showed high levels of expression at the vegetative stage, which decreased during the phase transition and reproductive growth stages in both Ppd-1a-NIL and Ppd-1b-NIL plants under short day conditions. By contrast to WCO1, TaHd1 was up-regulated during the reproductive stage. The level of TaHd1 expression was much higher in Ppd-1a-NIL than the Ppd-1b-NIL plants, suggesting that the Ppd-1b allele down-regulates TaHd1 under short day conditions. The present study indicates that down-regulation of VRN3/WFT together with TaHd1 is the cause of late flowering in the Ppd-1b-NIL plants under short day conditions."

"22948438","abstracttext","Two of the domains most widely shared among R genes are the nucleotide binding site (NBS) and protein kinase (PK) domains. The present study describes and maps a number of new oat resistance gene analogues (RGAs) with two purposes in mind: (1) to identify genetic regions that contain R genes and (2) to determine whether RGAs can be used as molecular markers for qualitative loci and for QTLs affording resistance to Puccinia coronata. Such genes have been mapped in the diploid A. strigosa × A. wiestii (Asw map) and the hexaploid MN841801-1 × Noble-2 (MN map). Genomic and cDNA NBS-RGA probes from oat, barley and wheat were used to produce RFLPs and to obtain markers by motif-directed profiling based on the NBS (NBS profiling) and PK (PK profiling) domains. The efficiency of primers used in NBS/PK profiling to amplify RGA fragments was assessed by sequencing individual marker bands derived from genomic and cDNA fragments. The positions of 184 markers were identified in the Asw map, while those for 99 were identified in the MN map. Large numbers of NBS and PK profiling markers were found in clusters across different linkage groups, with the PK profiling markers more evenly distributed. The location of markers throughout the genetic maps and the composition of marker clusters indicate that NBS- and PK-based markers cover partly complementary regions of oat genomes. Markers of the different classes obtained were found associated with the two resistance loci, PcA and R-284B-2, mapped on Asw, and with five out of eight QTLs for partial resistance in the MN map. 53 RGA-RFLPs and 187 NBS/PK profiling markers were also mapped on the hexaploid map A. byzantina cv. Kanota × A. sativa cv. Ogle. Significant co-localization was seen between the RGA markers in the KO map and other markers closely linked to resistance loci, such as those for P. coronata and barley yellow dwarf virus (Bydv) that were previously mapped in other segregating populations."

"23090387","abstracttext","WSCI (Wheat Subtilisin/Chymotrypsin Inhibitor) is a small protein belonging to the Potato inhibitor I family exhibiting a high content of essential amino acid. In addition to bacterial subtilisins and mammalian chymotrypsins, WSCI inhibits chymotrypsin-like activities isolated from digestive traits of a number of insect larvae. In vivo, as suggested for many plant proteinase inhibitors, WSCI seems to play a role of natural defence against attacks of pests and pathogens. The functional region of WSCI, containing the inhibitor reactive site (Met48-Glu49), corresponds to an extended flexible loop (Val42-Asp53) whose architecture is somehow stabilized by a number of secondary interactions established with a small β-sheet located underneath. The aim of this study was to employ a WSCI molecule as a stable scaffold to obtain recombinant inhibitors with new acquired anti-proteinase activity or, alternatively, inactive WSCI variants. A gene sequence coding for the native WSCI, along with genes coding for muteins with different specficities, could be exploited to obtain transformed non-food use plants with improved insect resistance. On the other hand, the genetic transformation of cereal plants over-expressing inactive WSCI muteins could represent a possible strategy to improve the nutritional quality of cereal-based foods, without risk of interference with human or animal digestive enzymes. Here, we described the characterization of four muteins containing single/multiple amino acid substitutions at the WSCI reactive site and/or at its proximity. Modalities of interaction of these muteins with proteinases (subtilisin, trypsin and chymotrypsin) were investigated by time course hydrolysis and molecular simulations studies."

Identifying and comparing CAZymes from fungi with different nutritional modes or infection mechanisms may provide information for better understanding of their life styles and infection models. To date, over hundreds of fungal genomes are publicly available. However, a systematic comparative analysis of fungal CAZymes across the entire fungal kingdom has not been reported."
"23617724","abstracttext_results","In this study, we systemically identified glycoside hydrolases (GHs), polysaccharide lyases (PLs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs), and glycosyltransferases (GTs) as well as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) in the predicted proteomes of 103 representative fungi from Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Zygomycota. Comparative analysis of these CAZymes that play major roles in plant polysaccharide degradation revealed that fungi exhibit tremendous diversity in the number and variety of CAZymes. Among them, some families of GHs and CEs are the most prevalent CAZymes that are distributed in all of the fungi analyzed. Importantly, cellulases of some GH families are present in fungi that are not known to have cellulose-degrading ability. In addition, our results also showed that in general, plant pathogenic fungi have the highest number of CAZymes. Biotrophic fungi tend to have fewer CAZymes than necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi. Pathogens of dicots often contain more pectinases than fungi infecting monocots. Interestingly, besides yeasts, many saprophytic fungi that are highly active in degrading plant biomass contain fewer CAZymes than plant pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, analysis of the gene expression profile of the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum revealed that most of the CAZyme genes related to cell wall degradation were up-regulated during plant infection. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed a complex history of lineage-specific expansions and attritions for the PL1 family."

"23651653","abstracttext_background","Composting is microbial decomposition of biodegradable materials and it is governed by physicochemical, physiological and microbiological factors. The importance of microbial communities (bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi) during composting is well established. However, the microbial diversity during composting may vary with the variety of composting materials and nutrient supplements. Therefore, it is necessary to study the diversity of microorganisms during composting of different agricultural byproducts like wheat bran, rice bran, rice husk, along with grass clippings and bulking agents. Here it has been attempted to assess the diversity of culturable bacteria during composting of agricultural byproducts."
"23651653","abstracttext_results","The culturable bacterial diversity was assessed during the process by isolating the most prominent bacteria. Bacterial population was found to be maximum during the mesophilic phase, but decreased during the thermophilic phase and declined further in the cooling and maturation phase of composting. The bacterial population ranged from 10(5) to 10(9) cfu g(-1) compost. The predominant bacteria were characterized biochemically, followed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The isolated strains, both Gram-positive and Gram-negative groups belonged to the order Burkholderiales, Enterobacteriales, Actinobacteriales and Bacillales, which includes genera e.g. Staphylococcus, Serratia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Terribacillus, Lysinibacillus Kocuria, Microbacterium, Acidovorax and Comamonas.

"23661079","abstracttext","Linkage disequilibrium (LD) is defined as a stochastic dependence between alleles at two or more loci. Although understanding LD is important in the study of the genetics of many species, little attention has been paid on how a covariance structure between many loci distributed across the genome should be represented. Given that biological systems at the cellular level often involve gene networks, it is appealing to evaluate LD from a network perspective, i.e., as a set of associated loci involved in a complex system. We applied a Markov network (MN) to study LD using data on 1,279 markers derived from 599 wheat inbred lines. The MN attempts to account for association between two markers, conditionally on the remaining markers in the network model. In this study, the recovery of the structure of a LD network was done through two variants of pseudo-likelihoods subject to an L1 penalty on the MN parameters. It is shown that, while the L1-regularized Markov network preserves features of a Bayesian network (BN), the nodes in the resulting networks have fewer links. The resulting sparse network, encoding conditional independencies, provides a clearer picture of association than marginal LD metrics, and a sparse graph eases interpretation markedly, since it includes a smaller number of edges than a BN. Thus, an L1-regularized sparse Markov network seems appealing for representing conditional LD with high-dimensional genomic data, where variables, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism markers, are expected to be sparsely connected."

"23867897","abstracttext","Filaggrin (FLG) loss-of-function skin barrier gene mutations are associated with atopic dermatitis (AD) and transepidermal water loss (TEWL). We investigated whether FLG mutation inheritance, skin barrier impairment, and AD also predispose to allergic sensitization to foods. Six hundred and nineteen exclusively breastfed infants were recruited at 3 months of age and examined for AD and disease severity (SCORing Atopic Dermatitis (SCORAD)), and screened for the common FLG mutations. TEWL was measured on unaffected forearm skin. In addition, skin prick testing was performed to six study foods (cow's milk, egg, cod, wheat, sesame, and peanut). Children with AD were significantly more likely to be sensitized (adjusted odds ratio (OR)=6.18, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.94-12.98, P<0.001), but this effect was independent of FLG mutation carriage, TEWL, and AD phenotype (flexural vs. non-flexural). There was also a strong association between food sensitization and AD severity (adjusted ORSCORAD<20=3.91, 95% CI: 1.70-9.00, P=0.001 vs. adjusted ORSCORAD20=25.60, 95% CI: 9.03-72.57, P<0.001). Equally, there was a positive association between AD and sensitization with individual foods (adjusted ORegg=9.48, 95% CI: 3.77-23.83, P<0.001; adjusted ORcow's milk=9.11, 95% CI: 2.27-36.59, P=0.002; adjusted ORpeanut=4.09, 95% CI: 1.00-16.76, P=0.05). AD is the main skin-related risk factor for food sensitization in young infants. In exclusively breastfed children, this suggests that allergic sensitization to foods can be mediated by cutaneous antigen-presenting cells."

"23777406","abstracttext","Fusarium pathogens are among the most damaging pathogens of cereals. These pathogens have the ability to attack the roots, seedlings, and flowering heads of barley and wheat plants with disease, resulting in yield loss and head blight disease and also resulting in the contamination of grain with mycotoxins harmful to human and animal health. There is increasing evidence that brassinosteroid (BR) hormones play an important role in plant defense against both biotic and abiotic stress agents and this study set out to determine if and how BR might affect Fusarium diseases of barley. Application of the epibrassinolide (epiBL) to heads of 'Lux' barley reduced the severity of Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium culmorum by 86% and reduced the FHB-associated loss in grain weight by 33%. Growth of plants in soil amended with epiBL resulted in a 28 and 35% reduction in Fusarium seedling blight (FSB) symptoms on the Lux and 'Akashinriki' barley, respectively. Microarray analysis was used to determine whether growth in epiBL-amended soil changed the transcriptional profile in stem base tissue during the early stages of FSB development. At 24 and 48 h post F. culmorum inoculation, there were 146 epiBL-responsive transcripts, the majority being from the 48-h time point (n = 118). Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis validated the results for eight transcripts, including five defense genes. The results of gene expression studies show that chromatin remodeling, hormonal signaling, photosynthesis, and pathogenesis-related genes are activated in plants as a result of growth in epiBL."
"23785303","articletitle","Breakage-fusion-bridge cycles and large insertions contribute to the rapid evolution of accessory chromosomes in a fungal pathogen."
"23785303","abstracttext","Chromosomal rearrangements are a major driver of eukaryotic genome evolution, affecting speciation, pathogenicity and cancer progression. Changes in chromosome structure are often initiated by mis-repair of double-strand breaks in the DNA. Mis-repair is particularly likely when telomeres are lost or when dispersed repeats misalign during crossing-over. Fungi carry highly polymorphic chromosomal complements showing substantial variation in chromosome length and number. The mechanisms driving chromosome polymorphism in fungi are poorly understood. We aimed to identify mechanisms of chromosomal rearrangements in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We combined population genomic resequencing and chromosomal segment PCR assays with electrophoretic karyotyping and resequencing of parents and offspring from experimental crosses to show that this pathogen harbors a highly diverse complement of accessory chromosomes that exhibits strong global geographic differentiation in numbers and lengths of chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes carried highly differentiated gene contents due to numerous insertions and deletions. The largest accessory chromosome recently doubled in length through insertions totaling 380 kb. Based on comparative genomics, we identified the precise breakpoint locations of these insertions. Nondisjunction during meiosis led to chromosome losses in progeny of three different crosses. We showed that a new accessory chromosome emerged in two viable offspring through a fusion between sister chromatids. Such chromosome fusion is likely to initiate a breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycle that can rapidly degenerate chromosomal structure. We suggest that the accessory chromosomes of Z. tritici originated mainly from ancient core chromosomes through a degeneration process that included BFB cycles, nondisjunction and mutational decay of duplicated sequences. The rapidly evolving accessory chromosome complement may serve as a cradle for adaptive evolution in this and other fungal pathogens."

"23793636","abstracttext","The noncellulolytic actinomycete Rhodococcus opacus strain PD630 is the model oleaginous prokaryote with regard to the accumulation and biosynthesis of lipids, which serve as carbon and energy storage compounds and can account for as much as 87% of the dry mass of the cell in this strain. In order to establish cellulose degradation in R. opacus PD630, we engineered strains that episomally expressed six different cellulase genes from Cellulomonas fimi ATCC 484 (cenABC, cex, cbhA) and Thermobifida fusca DSM43792 (cel6A), thereby enabling R. opacus PD630 to degrade cellulosic substrates to cellobiose. Of all the enzymes tested, five exhibited a cellulase activity toward carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and/or microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) as high as 0.313 ± 0.01 U · ml(-1), but recombinant strains also hydrolyzed cotton, birch cellulose, copy paper, and wheat straw. Cocultivations of recombinant strains expressing different cellulase genes with MCC as the substrate were carried out to identify an appropriate set of cellulases for efficient hydrolysis of cellulose by R. opacus. Based on these experiments, the multicellulase gene expression plasmid pCellulose was constructed, which enabled R. opacus PD630 to hydrolyze as much as 9.3% ± 0.6% (wt/vol) of the cellulose provided. For the direct production of lipids from birch cellulose, a two-step cocultivation experiment was carried out. In the first step, 20% (wt/vol) of the substrate was hydrolyzed by recombinant strains expressing the whole set of cellulase genes. The second step was performed by a recombinant cellobiose-utilizing strain of R. opacus PD630, which accumulated 15.1% (wt/wt) fatty acids from the cellobiose formed in the first step."

"23530038","abstracttext_significance","Enzymatic degradation of plant cell walls is required for wall loosening, which enhances pathogen invasion. A Magnaporthe oryzae enzyme, which was encoded by the Mocel7B gene, was predicted to act on 1,3-1,4-β-glucan degradation and transglycosylation reaction of cellotriose after partial purification from a culture filtrate of M. oryzae cells, followed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. A recombinant MoCel7B prepared by overexpression in M. oryzae exhibited endo-typical depolymerization of polysaccharides containing β-1,4-linkages, in which 1,3-1,4-β-glucan was the best substrate. When cellooligosaccharides were used as the substrate, the recombinant enzyme generated reaction products with both shorter and longer chain lengths than the substrate. In addition, incorporation of glucose and various oligosaccharides including sulforhodamine-conjugated cellobiose, laminarioligosaccharides, gentiobiose, xylobiose, mannobiose, and xyloglucan nonasaccharide into β-1,4-linked glucans were observed after incubation with the enzyme. These results indicate that the recombinant enzyme acts as an endotransglucosylase (ETG) that cleaves the glycosidic bond of β-1,4-glucan as a donor substrate and transfers the cleaved glucan chain to another molecule functioning as an acceptor substrate. Furthermore, ETG treatment caused greater extension of heat-treated wheat coleoptiles. The result suggests that ETG functions to induce wall loosening by cleaving the 1,3-1,4-β-glucan tethers of plant cell walls. On the other hand, use of cellohexaose as a substrate for ETG resulted in the production of cellulose II with a maximum length (degree of polymerization) of 26 glucose units. Thus, ETG functions to depolymerize and polymerize β-glucans, depending on the size of the acceptor substrate."

"23936387","abstracttext","Celiac disease is a common autoimmune disorder characterized by an intestinal inflammation triggered by gluten, a storage protein found in wheat, rye and barley. Similar to other autoimmune diseases such as type 1 diabetes, psoriasis and rheumatoid arthritis, celiac disease is the result of an immune response to self-antigens leading to tissue destruction and production of autoantibodies. Common diseases like celiac disease have a complex pattern of inheritance with inputs from both environmental as well as additive and non-additive genetic factors. In the past few years, Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have been successful in finding genetic risk variants behind many common diseases and traits. To complement and add to the previous findings, we performed a GWAS including 206 trios from 97 nuclear Swedish and Norwegian families affected with celiac disease. By stratifying for HLA-DQ, we identified a new genome-wide significant risk locus covering the DUSP10 gene. To further investigate the associations from the GWAS we performed pathway analyses and two-locus interaction analyses. These analyses showed an over-representation of genes involved in type 2 diabetes and identified a set of candidate mechanisms and genes of which some were selected for mRNA expression analysis using small intestinal biopsies from 98 patients. Several genes were expressed differently in the small intestinal mucosa from patients with celiac autoimmunity compared to intestinal mucosa from control patients. From top-scoring regions we identified susceptibility genes in several categories: 1) polarity and epithelial cell functionality; 2) intestinal smooth muscle; 3) growth and energy homeostasis, including proline and glutamine metabolism; and finally 4) innate and adaptive immune system. These genes and pathways, including specific functions of DUSP10, together reveal a new potential biological mechanism that could influence the genesis of celiac disease, and possibly also other chronic disorders with an inflammatory component."

"24747843","abstracttext","Protein disulfide isomerases (PDI) are involved in catalyzing protein disulfide bonding and isomerization in the endoplasmic reticulum and functions as a chaperone to inhibit the aggregation of misfolded proteins. Brachypodium distachyon is a widely used model plant for temperate grass species such as wheat and barley. In this work, we report the first molecular characterization, phylogenies, and expression profiles of PDI and PDI-like (PDIL) genes in B. distachyon in different tissues under various abiotic stresses. Eleven PDI and PDIL genes in the B. distachyon genome by in silico identification were evenly distributed across all five chromosomes. The plant PDI family has three conserved motifs that are involved in catalyzing protein disulfide bonding and isomerization, but a different exon/intron structural organization showed a high degree of structural differentiation. Two pairs of genes (BdPDIL4-1 and BdPDIL4-2; BdPDIL7-1 and BdPDIL7-2) contained segmental duplications, indicating each pair originated from one progenitor. Promoter analysis showed that Brachypodium PDI family members contained important cis-acting regulatory elements involved in seed storage protein synthesis and diverse stress response. All Brachypodium PDI genes investigated were ubiquitously expressed in different organs, but differentiation in expression levels among different genes and organs was clear. BdPDIL1-1 and BdPDIL5-1 were expressed abundantly in developing grains, suggesting that they have important roles in synthesis and accumulation of seed storage proteins. Diverse treatments (drought, salt, ABA, and H2O2) induced up- and down-regulated expression of Brachypodium PDI genes in seedling leaves. Interestingly, BdPDIL1-1 displayed significantly up-regulated expression following all abiotic stress treatments, indicating that it could be involved in multiple stress responses. Our results provide new insights into the structural and functional characteristics of the plant PDI gene family."

"24795368","abstracttext","As a result of its strong adaptation to wheat and rye sourdoughs, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis has the smallest genome within the genus Lactobacillus. The concomitant absence of some important antioxidative enzymes and the inability to synthesize glutathione suggest a role of cystine transport in maintenance of an intracellular thiol balance. Diamide [synonym 1,1'-azobis(N,N-dimethylformamide)] disturbs intracellular and membrane thiol levels in oxidizing protein thiols depending on its initial concentration. In this study, RNA sequencing was used to reveal the transcriptional response of L. sanfranciscensis DSM 20451(T) (wild type [WT]) and its ΔtcyB mutant with a nonfunctional cystine transporter after thiol stress caused by diamide. Along with the different expression of genes involved in amino acid starvation, pyrimidine synthesis, and energy production, our results show that thiol stress in the wild type can be compensated through activation of diverse chaperones and proteases whereas the ΔtcyB mutant shifts its metabolism in the direction of survival. Only a small set of genes are significantly differentially expressed between the wild type and the mutant. In the WT, mainly genes which are associated with a heat shock response are upregulated whereas glutamine import and synthesis genes are downregulated. In the ΔtcyB mutant, the whole opp operon was more highly expressed, as well as a protein which probably includes enzymes for methionine transport. The two proteins encoded by spxA and nrdH, which are involved in direct or indirect oxidative stress responses, are also upregulated in the mutant. This work emphasizes that even in the absence of definitive antioxidative enzymes, bacteria with a small genome and a high frequency of gene inactivation and elimination use small molecules such as the cysteine/cystine couple to overcome potential cell damage resulting from oxidative stress."

Here, we report the identification and cloning of two such members in R. oryzae strain NRRL 29086. Strain 29086 was one of several selected fungi grown on wheat or triticale bran and screened for xylanase activity among other hydrolytic actions. Its high activity (138 U/ml) in the culture supernatant led to the identification of two activity-stained proteins, designated Xyn-1 and Xyn-2 of respective molecular masses 32,000 and 22,000. These proteins were purified to electrophoretic homogeneity and characterized. The specific activities of Xyn-1 and Xyn-2 towards birchwood xylan were 605 and 7,710 U/mg, respectively. Kinetic data showed that the lower molecular weight Xyn-2 had a higher affinity (K m=3.2 ± 0.2 g/l) towards birchwood xylan than Xyn-1 by about 4-fold. The melting temperature (T m) of the two proteins, estimated to be in the range of 49.5-53.7 °C indicated that they are rather thermostable proteins. N-terminal and internal peptide sequences were obtained by chemical digestion of the purified xylanases to facilitate cloning, expression in Escherichia coli, and sequencing of the respective gene. The cloned Rhizopus xylanases were used to demonstrate release of xylose from flax shives-derived hemicellulose as model feedstock. Overall, this study expands the catalytic toolbox of GH10 and 11 family proteins that have applications in various industrial and bioproducts settings."

"24657866","abstracttext","Efficient degradation of plant polysaccharides in rumen requires xylanolytic enzymes with a high catalytic capacity. In this study, a full-length xylanase gene (xynA) was retrieved from the sheep rumen. The deduced XynA sequence contains a putative signal peptide, a catalytic motif of glycoside hydrolase family 10 (GH10), and an extra C-terminal proline-rich sequence without a homolog. To determine its function, both mature XynA and its C terminus-truncated mutant, XynA-Tr, were expressed in Escherichia coli. The C-terminal oligopeptide had significant effects on the function and structure of XynA. Compared with XynA-Tr, XynA exhibited improved specific activity (12-fold) and catalytic efficiency (14-fold), a higher temperature optimum (50°C versus 45°C), and broader ranges of temperature and pH optima (pH 5.0 to 7.5 and 40 to 60°C versus pH 5.5 to 6.5 and 40 to 50°C). Moreover, XynA released more xylose than XynA-Tr when using beech wood xylan and wheat arabinoxylan as the substrate. The underlying mechanisms responsible for these changes were analyzed by substrate binding assay, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), and xylooligosaccharide hydrolysis. XynA had no ability to bind to any of the tested soluble and insoluble polysaccharides. However, it contained more α helices and had a greater affinity and catalytic efficiency toward xylooligosaccharides, which benefited complete substrate degradation. Similar results were obtained when the C-terminal sequence was fused to another GH10 xylanase from sheep rumen. This study reveals an engineering strategy to improve the catalytic performance of enzymes."
"24495467","articletitle","Cocksfoot mottle virus coat protein is dispensable for the systemic infection."
"24495467","abstracttext_background","The Sobemovirus genome consists of polycistronic single-stranded positive-sense RNA. The first ORF encodes P1, a suppressor of RNA silencing required for virus movement. The coat protein (CP) is expressed from the 3' proximal ORF3 via subgenomic RNA. In addition to its structural role, the CP of some sobemoviruses has been reported to be required for systemic movement and to interact with P1. The aim of this study was to analyse the role of Cocksfoot mottle virus (CfMV) CP in the suppression of RNA silencing and virus movement."
"24495467","abstracttext_methods","Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression method was used for testing CfMV CP capacity to suppress RNA silencing. CP substitution and deletion mutants were generated to examine the role of this protein in CfMV infection, using three host plants (oat, barley and wheat). The viral movement was characterised with CfMV expressing EGFP fused to the C-terminus of CP."
"24495467","abstracttext_results","In the current study we show that CfMV CP is an additional RNA silencing suppressor. Interestingly, we observed that all CP mutant viruses were able to infect the three tested host plants systemically, although usually with reduced accumulation. CfMV expressing EGFP was detected in epidermal and mesophyll cells of inoculated leaves. Although EGFP fluorescence was not detected in upper leaves, some plants displayed CfMV symptoms. Analysis of the upper leaves revealed that the viruses had lost the EGFP sequence and sometimes also most of the CP gene."
"24495467","abstracttext_conclusions","The present study demonstrates that CfMV CP suppresses RNA silencing but, surprisingly, is dispensable for systemic movement. Thus, CfMV does not move as virion in the tested host plants. The composition of the movement RNP complex remains to be elucidated."

"24399024","abstracttext","Four hundred seventy Rhizoctonia solani isolates from different leguminous hosts originating from 16 agro-ecological regions of India covering 21 states and 72 districts were collected. The disease incidence caused by R. solani varied from 6.8 to 22.2 % in the areas surveyed. Deccan plateau and central highlands, hot sub-humid ecoregion followed by northern plain and central highlands and hot semi-arid ecoregion showed the highest disease incidence. R. solani isolates were highly variable in growth diameter, number, size and pattern of sclerotia formation as well as hyphal width. The isolates obtained from aerial part of the infected plants showing web blight symptoms produced sclerotia of 1-2 mm in size whereas, the isolates obtained from infected root of the plants showing wet root rot symptoms produced microsclerotia (<1 mm). Majority of R. solani isolates showed <8 μm hyphal diameter. Based on morphological characters the isolates were categorized into 49 groups. Seven anastomosis groups (AGs) were identified among the populations of R. solani associated with the pulse crops. The frequency (25.6 %) of AG3 was the highest followed by AG2-3 (20.9 %) and AG5 (17.4 %). The cropping sequence of rice/sorghum/wheat-chickpea/mungbean/urdbean/cowpea/ricebean influenced the dominance of AG1 (16.3 %). Phylogenetic analysis utilizing ITS-5.8S rDNA gene sequences indicated high level of genetic similarity among isolates representing different AGs, crops and regions. ITS groups did not correspond to the morphological characters. The sequence data from this article has been deposited with NCBI data libraries with JF701707 to JF701795 accession numbers."
"24099390","articletitle","Application of resistance gene analog markers to analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice."
"24099390","abstracttext","Plant disease resistance gene analog (RGA) markers were designed according to the conserved sequence of known RGAs and used to map resistance genes. We used genome-wide RGA markers for genetic analyses of structure and diversity in a global rice germplasm collection. Of the 472 RGA markers, 138 were polymorphic and these were applied to 178 entries selected from the USDA rice core collection. Results from the RGA markers were similar between two methods, UPGMA and STRUCTURE. Additionally, the results from RGA markers in our study were agreeable with those previously reported from SSR markers, including cluster of ancestral classification, genetic diversity estimates, genetic relatedness, and cluster of geographic origins. These results suggest that RGA markers are applicable for analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice. However, unlike SSR markers, the RGA markers failed to differentiate temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and aromatic subgroups. The restricted way for developing RGA markers from the cDNA sequence might limit the polymorphism of RGA markers in the genome, thus limiting the discriminatory power in comparison with SSR markers. Genetic differentiation obtained using RGA markers may be useful for defining genetic diversity of a suite of random R genes in plants, as many studies show a differentiation of resistance to a wide array of pathogens. They could also help to characterize the genetic structure and geographic distribution in crops, including rice, wheat, barley, and banana."

"23995929","abstracttext","The influence of land use on soil bio-resources is largely unknown. We examined the communities of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in wheat-growing cropland, natural areas, and seminatural areas along roads. We sampled the Canadian prairie extensively (317 sites) and sampled 20 sites in the Atlantic maritime ecozone for comparison. The proportions of the different AM fungal taxa in the communities found at these sites varied with land use type and ecozones, based on pyrosequencing of 18S rRNA gene (rDNA) amplicons, but the lists of AM fungal taxa obtained from the different land use types and ecozones were very similar. In the prairie, the Glomeraceae family was the most abundant and diverse family of Glomeromycota, followed by the Claroideoglomeraceae, but in the Atlantic maritime ecozone, the Claroideoglomeraceae family was most abundant. In the prairie, species richness and Shannon's diversity index were highest in roadsides, whereas cropland had a higher degree of species richness than roadsides in the Atlantic maritime ecozone. The frequencies of occurrence of the different AM fungal taxa in croplands in the prairie and Atlantic maritime ecozones were highly correlated, but the AM fungal communities in these ecozones had different structures. We conclude that the AM fungal resources of soils are resilient to disturbance and that the richness of AM fungi under cropland management has been maintained, despite evidence of a structural shift imposed by this type of land use. Roadsides in the Canadian prairie are a good repository for the conservation of AM fungal diversity."

"24002067","abstracttext","Erythrocyte invasion by merozoites is an obligatory stage of Plasmodium infection and is essential to disease progression. Proteins in the apical organelles of merozoites mediate the invasion of erythrocytes and are potential malaria vaccine candidates. Rhoptry-associated, leucine zipper-like protein 1 (RALP1) of Plasmodium falciparum was previously found to be specifically expressed in schizont stages and localized to the rhoptries of merozoites by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Also, RALP1 has been refractory to gene knockout attempts, suggesting that it is essential for blood-stage parasite survival. These characteristics suggest that RALP1 can be a potential blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen, and here we assessed its potential in this regard. Antibodies were raised against recombinant RALP1 proteins synthesized by using the wheat germ cell-free system. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated for the first time that RALP1 is a rhoptry neck protein of merozoites. Moreover, our IFA data showed that RALP1 translocates from the rhoptry neck to the moving junction during merozoite invasion. Growth and invasion inhibition assays revealed that anti-RALP1 antibodies inhibit the invasion of erythrocytes by merozoites. The findings that RALP1 possesses an erythrocyte-binding epitope in the C-terminal region and that anti-RALP1 antibodies disrupt tight-junction formation, are evidence that RALP1 plays an important role during merozoite invasion of erythrocytes. In addition, human sera collected from areas in Thailand and Mali where malaria is endemic recognized this protein. Overall, our findings indicate that RALP1 is a rhoptry neck erythrocyte-binding protein and that it qualifies as a potential blood-stage vaccine candidate."

"24393083","abstracttext","Heat stress (HS) depresses pig performance mainly because of appetite reduction, although other factors involved in the cellular availability of nutrients may also contribute to that depression. An experiment was conducted with twelve pair-fed pigs (30.3 ± 2.7 kg BW) to examine the effect of severe HS (up to 45 °C) on the expression of genes coding for two cationic amino acid (AA) transporters (b(0,+) AT and CAT-1), leptin, heat-shock protein (Hsp-90) and myosin in several tissues; serum concentrations (SC) of AA; and performance. There were two treatments: Comfort, pigs housed at an average temperature of 22 (±2) °C; and HS, pigs housed in a similar room with no climate control, where temperature was raised up to 45 °C. All pigs received the same wheat-soybean meal diet and had similar daily feed intake. Comfort pigs had a higher daily gain and better gain/feed ratio than HS pigs (p < 0.05). The expression of b(0,+) AT in jejunum and liver, that of myosin in the Semitendinosus muscle, and leptin in adipose tissue was lower, but CAT-1 in jejunum and liver, and Hsp-90 in liver was higher in HS pigs. The SC of Lys and Met in HS pigs were around 55% and 20%, respectively, of that in Comfort pigs (p < 0.05). In conclusion, HS affects the expression of cationic AA transporters, myosin, Hsp-90, leptin; the SC of Lys and Met; and the performance of pair-fed pigs. These results suggest that HS-related changes in gene expression affect the performance of pigs beyond the effect caused by the reduction in voluntary feed intake."

"24474810","abstracttext","Establishing crop cultivars with strong tolerance to P and N deprivation, high salinity, and drought is an effective way to improve crop yield and promote sustainable agriculture worldwide. A vacuolar H+-pyrophosphatase (V-H+-PPase) gene in wheat (TaVP) was functionally characterized in this study. TaVP cDNA is 2586-bp long and encodes a 775-amino-acid polypeptide that contains 10 conserved membrane-spanning domains. Transcription of TaVP was upregulated by inorganic phosphate (Pi) and N deprivation, high salinity, and drought. Transgene analysis revealed that TaVP overexpression improved plant growth under normal conditions and specifically under Pi and N deprivation stresses, high salinity, and drought. The improvement of growth of the transgenic plants was found to be closely related to elevated V-H+-PPase activities in their tonoplasts and enlarged root systems, which possibly resulted from elevated expression of auxin transport-associated genes. TaVP-overexpressing plants showed high dry mass, photosynthetic efficiencies, antioxidant enzyme activities, and P, N, and soluble carbohydrate concentrations under various growth conditions, particularly under the stress conditions. The transcription of phosphate and nitrate transporter genes was not altered in TaVP-overexpressing plants compared with the wild type, suggesting that high P and N concentrations regulated by TaVP were caused by increased root absorption area instead of alteration of Pi and NO3- acquisition kinetics. TaVP is important in the tolerance of multiple stresses and can serve as a useful genetic resource to improve plant P- and N-use efficiencies and to increase tolerance to high salinity and drought."

"24532775","abstracttext","Acm2, the major autolysin of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1, was recently found to be O-glycosylated with N-acetylhexosamine, likely N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc). In this study, we set out to identify the glycosylation machinery by employing a comparative genomics approach to identify Gtf1 homologues, which are involved in fimbria-associated protein 1 (Fap1) glycosylation in Streptococcus parasanguinis. This in silico approach resulted in the identification of 6 candidate L. plantarum WCFS1 genes with significant homology to Gtf1, namely, tagE1 to tagE6. These candidate genes were targeted by systematic gene deletion, followed by assessment of the consequences on glycosylation of Acm2. We observed a changed mobility of Acm2 on SDS-PAGE in the tagE5E6 deletion strain, while deletion of other tagE genes resulted in Acm2 mobility comparable to that of the wild type. Subsequent mass spectrometry analysis of excised and in-gel-digested Acm2 confirmed the loss of glycosylation on Acm2 in the tagE5E6 deletion mutant, whereas a lectin blot using GlcNAc-specific succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA) revealed that besides Acm2, tagE5E6 deletion also abolished all but one other sWGA-reactive, protease-sensitive signal. Only complementation of both tagE5 and tagE6 restored those sWGA lectin signals, establishing that TagE5 and TagE6 are both required for the glycosylation of Acm2 as well as the vast majority of other sWGA-reactive proteins. Finally, sWGA lectin blotting experiments using a panel of 8 other L. plantarum strains revealed that protein glycosylation is a common feature in L. plantarum strains. With the establishment of these enzymes as protein glycosyltransferases, we propose to rename TagE5 and TagE6 as GtfA and GtfB, respectively."

"24443494","abstracttext","Targeted genome modification technologies are key tools for functional genomics. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated endonuclease Cas9 system (CRISPR/Cas9) is an emerging technology for targeted genome modification. The CRISPR/Cas9 system consists of a short guide RNA (gRNA), which specifies the target genome sequence, and the Cas9 protein, which has endonuclease activity. The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been applied to model animals and flowering plants, including rice, sorghum, wheat, tobacco and Arabidopsis. Here, we report the application of CRISPR/Cas9 to targeted mutagenesis in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha L., which has emerged as a model species for studying land plant evolution. The U6 promoter of M. polymorpha was identified and cloned to express the gRNA. The target sequence of the gRNA was designed to disrupt the gene encoding auxin response factor 1 (ARF1) in M. polymorpha. Using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, we isolated stable mutants in the gametophyte generation of M. polymorpha. CRISPR/Cas9-based site-directed mutagenesis in vivo was achieved using either the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S or M. polymorpha EF1α promoter to express Cas9. Isolated mutant individuals showing an auxin-resistant phenotype were not chimeric. Moreover, stable mutants were produced by asexual reproduction of T1 plants. Multiple arf1 alleles were easily established using CRIPSR/Cas9-based targeted mutagenesis. Our results provide a rapid and simple approach for molecular genetics in M. polymorpha, and raise the possibility that CRISPR/Cas9 may be applied to a wide variety of plant species."
"24280346","articletitle","Diversity and genetics of nitrogen-induced susceptibility to the blast fungus in rice and wheat."
"24280346","abstracttext_background","Nitrogen often increases disease susceptibility, a phenomenon that can be observed under controlled conditions and called NIS, for Nitrogen-Induced Susceptibility. NIS has long been reported in the case of rice blast disease caused by the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. We used an experimental system that does not strongly affect plant development to address the question of NIS polymorphism across rice diversity and further explored this phenomenon in wheat. We tested the two major types of resistance, namely quantitative/partial resistance and resistance driven by known resistance genes. Indeed there are conflicting reports on the effects of NIS on the first one and none on the last one. Finally, the genetics of NIS is not well documented and only few loci have been identified that may control this phenomenon."
"24280346","abstracttext_results","Our data indicate that NIS is a general phenomenon affecting resistance to blast fungus in these two cereals. We show that the capacity of rice to display NIS is highly polymorphic and does not correlate with difference related to indica/japonica sub-groups. We also tested the robustness of three different major resistance genes under high nitrogen. Nitrogen partially breaks down resistance triggered by the Pi1 gene. Cytological examination indicates that penetration rate is not affected by high nitrogen whereas growth of the fungus is increased inside the plant. Using the CSSL mapping population between Nipponbare and Kasalath, we identified a Kasalath locus on chromosome 1, called NIS1, which dominantly increases susceptibility under high nitrogen. We discuss the possible relationships between Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE), disease resistance regulation and NIS."
"24280346","abstracttext_conclusions","This work provides evidences that robust forms of partial resistance exist across diversity and can be easily identified with our protocol. This work also suggests that under certain environmental circumstances, complete resistance may breakdown, irrelevantly of the capacity of the fungus to mutate. These aspects should be considered while breeding for robust forms of resistance to blast disease."

Winter-hardy plants interpret seasonal changes and can acquire the ability to resist sub-zero temperatures. This cold acclimation process is associated with physiological, biochemical and molecular alterations in cereals. Brachypodium distachyon is considered a powerful model system to study the response of temperate cereals to adverse environmental conditions. To date, little is known about the cold acclimation and freezing tolerance capacities of Brachypodium. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the cold hardiness of seven diploid Brachypodium accessions."
"24323247","abstracttext_methods","An integrated approach, involving monitoring of phenological indicators along with expression profiling of the major vernalization regulator VRN1 orthologue, was followed. In parallel, soluble sugars and proline contents were determined along with expression profiles of two COR genes in plants exposed to low temperatures. Finally, whole-plant freezing tests were performed to evaluate the freezing tolerance capacity of Brachypodium."
"24323247","abstracttext_key results","Cold treatment accelerated the transition from the vegetative to the reproductive phase in all diploid Brachypodium accessions tested. In addition, low temperature exposure triggered the gradual accumulation of BradiVRN1 transcripts in all accessions tested. These accessions exhibited a clear cold acclimation response by progressively accumulating proline, sugars and COR gene transcripts. However, whole-plant freezing tests revealed that these seven diploid accessions only have a limited capacity to develop freezing tolerance when compared with winter varieties of temperate cereals such as wheat and barley. Furthermore, little difference in terms of survival was observed among the accessions tested despite their previous classification as either spring or winter genotypes."

"24324669","abstracttext_methods","By searching the MEDLINE database and four Chinese full-text databases (CNKI, CBM, VIP and WANFANG) (up to August 2012), as well as two HLA allele frequency net databases and the Chinese Statistics Yearbook databases, we systematically reviewed the literature on definite and suspected cases of celiac disease, the predisposing HLA allele frequencies, and on gluten exposure in China. Meta-analysis was performed by analyzing DQ2, DQ8 and DQB1*0201 gene frequencies and heterogeneity in populations from different geographic regions and ethnicities in China."
"24324669","abstracttext_results","At present, the number of reported celiac disease cases is extremely low in China. The frequencies of the HLA-DQ2.5 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes were 3.4% (95% confidence interval 1.3-5.5%) and 2.1% (0.1-4.1%), respectively. HLA-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 antigen frequencies were 18.4% (15.0-21.7%) and 8.0% (4.5-11.4%), respectively. The frequency of the DQB1*0201 allele was 10.5% (9.3-11.6%) and it was more common in the northern Chinese than in the southern Chinese populations. The chance of being exposed to gluten is rapidly increasing all over China nowadays."
"24324669","abstracttext_conclusion","The data on HLA haplotyping, in conjunction with increasing wheat consumption, strongly suggests that the occurrence of celiac disease is more common in China than currently reported. Coordinated measures by the Chinese government, medical and agricultural research institutions, and food industries, would be justified to create more awareness about celiac disease and to prevent it becoming a medical and societal burden."

"24296078","abstracttext","Thymoquinone (TQ) is a major constituent of Nigella sativa oil with reported anti-oxidative activity and anti-inflammatory activity in animal cells. It also inhibits proliferation and induces programmed cell death (apoptosis) in human skin cancer cells. The present study sought to detect the influence of TQ on dividing cells of three plant systems and on expression of Bcl2-associated athanogene-like (BAG-like) genes that might be involved during the process of cell death. BAG genes are known for the regulation of diverse physiological processes in animals, including apoptosis, tumorigenesis, stress responses, and cell division. Synthetic TQ at 0.1mg/mL greatly reduced wheat seed germination rate, whereas 0.2mg/mL completely inhibited germination. An Evans blue assay revealed moderate cell death in the meristematic zone of Glycine max roots after 1h of TQ treatment (0.2mg/mL), with severe cell death occurring in this zone after 2h of treatment. Light microscopy of TQ-treated (0.2mg/mL) onion hairy root tips for 1h revealed anti-mitotic activity and also cell death-associated changes, including nuclear membrane disruption and nuclear fragmentation. Transmission electron microscopy of TQ-treated cells (0.2mg/mL) for 1h revealed shrinkage of the plasma membrane, leakage of cell lysate, degradation of cell walls, enlargement of vacuoles and condensation of nuclei. Expression of one BAG-like gene, previously associated with cell death, was induced 20 min after TQ treatment in Glycine max root tip cells. Thus, TQ has multiple effects, including cell death, on dividing plant cells and plants may serve as a useful system to further investigate the mechanisms underlying the response of eukaryotic cells to TQ."

"24318302","abstracttext","The developmental time period and the magnitude of expression of the genes for the principal cottonseed storage proteins have been measured by several means. RNA was extracted from cotton cotyledons at stages during embryogenesis and the relative amounts of the mRNAS for these proteins were determined by cell-free translation in the wheat germ system and by dot and northern hybridization of the RNA with cloned cDNA probes representing the three subfamilies of the major storage protein genes. The rates of reassociation in solution of some of the RNAs with one of the cDNA clones were also determined. Data from all four procedures show that the storage protein mRNAs are demonstrable in very small embryo cotyledons, rapidly reach a high abundance level that is maintained during most of embryo growth, and then fall precipitously in amount in the last days of embryogenesis. The expression of all three gene subfamilies appears coordinate.Further, cDNA reverse transcribed from the poly(A)(+) mRNA from a stage of maximum storage protein synthesis was hybridized to saturation with cDNA clones representing each of the subfamilies. These data indicate that the mRNAs for two of the families reach the same relative level in the total mRNA population which is about 15% of the total mRNA mass. The mRNA of the third subfamily comprises only 5% of the total mRNA mass at this stage. This apparent 3∶3∶1 ratio of mRNAs does not change during the period of storage protein synthesis. Based on the amounts of the storage protein species in the mature seed, the mRNAs of each subfamily appear to be translated to the same extent during embryogenesis."

"24253117","abstracttext","Gliadin proteins of the hexaploid wheat variety 'Chinese Spring', and of its nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelocentric aneuploid lines, were analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Reversed-phase separations were carried out at 70°C on C8 and C18 columns using a gradient of increasing acetonitrile concentration in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Thirty-five components were separated and all were found to be controlled by genes on the short arms of group 1 and group 6 chromosomes (the complex Gli-1 and Gli-2 loci). Results indicated that gluten polypeptides elute as groups in order of increasing hydrophobicity in the following approximate order: (1) albumins plus globulins, (2) ω-gliadins, (3) high molecular weight (MW) glutenin subunits, (4) α-type gliadins, (5) low MW glutenin subunits, and (6) γ-gliadins. The three distinct protein types coded by genes at the complex Gli-I loci (ω-gliadins, γ-gliadins, and low MW glutenin subunits) thus have uniquely different surface hydrophobicities. Similarly, gene locations for hexaploid 'Cheyenne' gliadins and durum gliadin proteins in the varieties 'Langdon', 'Edmore', and 'Kharkovskaya-5' were determined through RP-HPLC analysis of aneuploid lines. All results confirm known locations of genes for gliadin proteins, and demonstrate that RP-HPLC is a powerful new tool for analysis of gliadins in breeding and genetic studies."

As a member of the Poaceae, Brachypodium distachyon L. is a new model plant for wheat and barley as well as several potential biofuel grasses such as switchgrass. Vegetative growth is vital for biomass accumulation of plants, but knowledge regarding the role of protein phosphorylation modification during vegetative growth, especially in biofuel plants, is far from comprehensive."
"24885693","abstracttext_results","In this study, we carried out the first large-scale phosphoproteome analysis of seedling leaves in Brachypodium accession Bd21 using TiO2 microcolumns combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and MaxQuant software. A total of 1470 phosphorylation sites in 950 phosphoproteins were identified, and these phosphoproteins were implicated in various molecular functions and basic cellular processes by gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses. Among the 950 phosphoproteins identified, 127 contained 3 to 8 phosphorylation sites. Conservation analysis showed that 93.4% of the 950 phosphoproteins had phosphorylation orthologs in other plant species. Motif-X analysis of the phosphorylation sites identified 13 significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs, of which 3 were novel phosphorylation motifs. Meanwhile, there were 91 phosphoproteins with both multiple phosphorylation sites and multiple phosphorylation motifs. In addition, we identified 58 phosphorylated transcription factors across 21 families and found out 6 significantly over-represented transcription factor families (C3H, Trihelix, CAMTA, TALE, MYB_related and CPP). Eighty-four protein kinases (PKs), 8 protein phosphatases (PPs) and 6 CESAs were recognized as phosphoproteins."
"24885693","abstracttext_conclusions","Through a large-scale bioinformatics analysis of the phosphorylation data in seedling leaves, a complicated PKs- and PPs- centered network related to rapid vegetative growth was deciphered in B. distachyon. We revealed a MAPK cascade network that might play the crucial roles during the phosphorylation signal transduction in leaf growth and development. The phosphoproteins and phosphosites identified from our study expanded our knowledge of protein phosphorylation modification in plants, especially in monocots."

"24377135","abstracttext","Two wheat cultivars, C306 and PBW343 contrasting in drought tolerance were compared for their antioxidant response and Lea genes' expression under salt stress (SS) and combined stress (CS) of salt stress plus water stress during seedlings growth. The drought susceptible cultivar (PBW343) behaved different towards SS/CS than towards WS. It accumulated more dry masses in shoots, more ascorbate, had higher ascorbate to dehydroascorbate ratio, lesser dehydroascorbate, lesser malondialdehyde (MDA), more proline and higher antioxidant enzymes under SS than under WS. CS increased dry masses, ascorbate, ascorbate to dehydroascorbate ratio, antioxidant enzymes and decreased dehydroascorbate and MDA contents from levels under WS. The drought tolerant cultivar (C306) though showed higher levels of ascorbate, ascorbate to dehydroascorbate ratio, lower levels of dehydroascorbate, showed lesser dry biomasses in shoots, higher MDA and lesser ascorbate peroxidase and catalase activities under SS than under WS and these features were improved on combining WS with SS. All lea genes were induced under all stresses in both cultivars except Wrab17 in C306 only, was not induced under any stress. Eight Lea genes out of ten were induced higher under WS than SS in C306 but induced same in PBW343. Wdhn13 gene was higher salt-responsive than other lea genes in both cultivars."

"24567494","abstracttext","A total of 16 BnaGLN1 genes coding for cytosolic glutamine synthetase isoforms (EC 6.3.1.2.) were found in the Brassica napus genome. The total number of BnaGLN1 genes, their phylogenetic relationships, and genetic locations are in agreement with the evolutionary history of Brassica species. Two BnaGLN1.1, two BnaGLN1.2, six BnaGLN1.3, four BnaGLN1.4, and two BnaGLN1.5 genes were found and named according to the standardized nomenclature for the Brassica genus. Gene expression showed conserved responses to nitrogen availability and leaf senescence among the Brassiceae tribe. The BnaGLN1.1 and BnaGLN1.4 families are overexpressed during leaf senescence and in response to nitrogen limitation. The BnaGLN1.2 family is up-regulated under high nitrogen regimes. The members of the BnaGLN1.3 family are not affected by nitrogen availability and are more expressed in stems than in leaves. Expression of the two BnaGLN1.5 genes is almost undetectable in vegetative tissues. Regulations arising from plant interactions with their environment (such as nitrogen resources), final architecture, and therefore sink-source relations in planta, seem to be globally conserved between Arabidopsis and B. napus. Similarities of the coding sequence (CDS) and protein sequences, expression profiles, response to nitrogen availability, and ageing suggest that the roles of the different GLN1 families have been conserved among the Brassiceae tribe. These findings are encouraging the transfer of knowledge from the Arabidopsis model plant to the B. napus crop plant. They are of special interest when considering the role of glutamine synthetase in crop yield and grain quality in maize and wheat."

"24917237","abstracttext","Coeliac disease (CD) is a highly prevalent autoimmune disorder that is triggered by the ingestion of wheat gluten and related proteins in genetically susceptible individuals. The CD is associated with human leucocyte antigen (HLA) genes particularly with HLA-DQ alleles encoding HLA-DQ2 and DQ8 proteins. To define risk and severity alleles for CD, a total of 120 definite CD patients and 100 healthy controls were genotyped for HLA-DQB1 gene. HLA-DQB1 genotyping was performed in all patients and controls using PCR-SSP technique, and to evaluate the clinical relevance of testing for HLA-DQB1 and determining absolute risk of disease, prevalence-corrected positive predictive value and prevalence-corrected negative predictive value (PcPPV and PcNPV) were calculated. Our results for a first time show that DQB1*02:00 and DQB1*03:02 alleles and DQB1*02:01/03:02 genotype very significantly associated with increased risk of patients with CD, and DQB1*03:01,4 allele provides protection against CD in Iranian patients. Furthermore, the PcPPV for DQB*02:01 and 03:02 alleles in CD were 0.014 and 0.012, respectively, and the highest absolute risk presented by DQB*0201/0302 genotype (PcPPV = 0.079) and 98% of patients with CD carried DQB1*02:01/x or DQB1*03:02/x genotype. The results also clearly demonstrated that the DQB1*02:01 allele significantly associated with severity of CD, while DQB1*03:02 allele associated with mild form of CD. These results suggest that clinically suspected individuals for CD and first-degree relatives of patients with CD to be screened for HLA-DQB*0201 and DQB*0302 alleles for possible early diagnosis and treatments."

"25136124","abstracttext","Enzymes that degrade dietary and host-derived glycans represent the most abundant functional activities encoded by genes unique to the human gut microbiome. However, the biochemical activities of a vast majority of the glycan-degrading enzymes are poorly understood. Here, we use transcriptome sequencing to understand the diversity of genes expressed by the human gut bacteria Bacteroides intestinalis and Bacteroides ovatus grown in monoculture with the abundant dietary polysaccharide xylan. The most highly induced carbohydrate active genes encode a unique glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10 endoxylanase (BiXyn10A or BACINT_04215 and BACOVA_04390) that is highly conserved in the Bacteroidetes xylan utilization system. The BiXyn10A modular architecture consists of a GH10 catalytic module disrupted by a 250 amino acid sequence of unknown function. Biochemical analysis of BiXyn10A demonstrated that such insertion sequences encode a new family of carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) that binds to xylose-configured oligosaccharide/polysaccharide ligands, the substrate of the BiXyn10A enzymatic activity. The crystal structures of CBM1 from BiXyn10A (1.8 Å), a cocomplex of BiXyn10A CBM1 with xylohexaose (1.14 Å), and the CBM from its homolog in the Prevotella bryantii B14 Xyn10C (1.68 Å) reveal an unanticipated mode for ligand binding. A minimal enzyme mix, composed of the gene products of four of the most highly up-regulated genes during growth on wheat arabinoxylan, depolymerizes the polysaccharide into its component sugars. The combined biochemical and biophysical studies presented here provide a framework for understanding fiber metabolism by an important group within the commensal bacterial population known to influence human health."

"26442056","abstracttext","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were undertaken to identify SNP markers associated with yield and yield-related traits in 123 Pakistani historical wheat cultivars evaluated during 2011-2014 seasons under rainfed field conditions. The population was genotyped by using high-density Illumina iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay, and finally 14,960 high quality SNPs were used in GWAS. Population structure examined using 1000 unlinked markers identified seven subpopulations (K = 7) that were representative of different breeding programs in Pakistan, in addition to local landraces. Forty four stable marker-trait associations (MTAs) with -log p > 4 were identified for nine yield-related traits. Nine multi-trait MTAs were found on chromosomes 1AL, 1BS, 2AL, 2BS, 2BL, 4BL, 5BL, 6AL, and 6BL, and those on 5BL and 6AL were stable across two seasons. Gene annotation and syntey identified that 14 trait-associated SNPs were linked to genes having significant importance in plant development. Favorable alleles for days to heading (DH), plant height (PH), thousand grain weight (TGW), and grain yield (GY) showed minor additive effects and their frequencies were slightly higher in cultivars released after 2000. However, no selection pressure on any favorable allele was identified. These genomic regions identified have historically contributed to achieve yield gains from 2.63 million tons in 1947 to 25.7 million tons in 2015. Future breeding strategies can be devised to initiate marker assisted breeding to accumulate these favorable alleles of SNPs associated with yield-related traits to increase grain yield. Additionally, in silico identification of 454-contigs corresponding to MTAs will facilitate fine mapping and subsequent cloning of candidate genes and functional marker development."

"25582052","abstracttext","Background Establishing bladder reflex arcs only with the efferent pathway to induce micturition after spinal cord injury (SCI) has been successful. However, the absence of sensory function and micturition desires can lead to serious complications. Objectives To reconstruct a bladder reflex arc with both afferent and efferent pathways to achieve atonic bladder innervation after SCI. Methods A reflex arc was established by microanastomosis of the S2 dorsal root to the peripheral process of the L5 dorsal ganglion and the L5 ventral root to the S2 ventral root. The functions of the reflex arc were evaluated using electrophysiology, wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) tracing, and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) immunocytochemistry analysis. Hind-paw motion was evaluated by CatWalk gait. Results Compound action potentials and compound muscle action potentials were recorded at the right L5 dorsal root following electrical stimulation of right S2 dorsal root. Similar to the control side, these were not significantly different before or after the spinal cord destruction between L6 and S4. WGA-HRP tracing and CGRP immunocytochemistry showed that construction of the afferent and efferent pathways of the bladder reflex arc encouraged axonal regeneration of motor and sensory nerves, which then made contact with the anterior and posterior horns of the spinal cord, ultimately reestablishing axoplasmic transportation. Gait analysis showed that at 3 months following the operation, only the regularity index was significantly different as compared with 1 day before the operation, other parameters showing no difference. Conclusion Bladder reflex arc with the afferent and efferent pathways reconstructs the micturition function without great influence on the motion of leg."

"25548041","abstracttext","An extracellular chlorogenic acid esterase from Ustilago maydis (UmChlE) was purified to homogeneity by using three separation steps, including anion-exchange chromatography on a Q Sepharose FF column, preparative isoelectric focusing (IEF), and, finally, a combination of affinity chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography on polyamide. SDS-PAGE analysis suggested a monomeric protein of ∼71 kDa. The purified enzyme showed maximal activity at pH 7.5 and at 37°C and was active over a wide pH range (3.5 to 9.5). Previously described chlorogenic acid esterases exhibited a comparable affinity for chlorogenic acid, but the enzyme from Ustilago was also active on typical feruloyl esterase substrates. Kinetic constants for chlorogenic acid, methyl p-coumarate, methyl caffeate, and methyl ferulate were as follows: Km values of 19.6 μM, 64.1 μM, 72.5 μM, and 101.8 μM, respectively, and kcat/Km values of 25.83 mM(-1) s(-1), 7.63 mM(-1) s(-1), 3.83 mM(-1) s(-1) and 3.75 mM(-1) s(-1), respectively. UmChlE released ferulic, p-coumaric, and caffeic acids from natural substrates such as destarched wheat bran (DSWB) and coffee pulp (CP), confirming activity on complex plant biomass. The full-length gene encoding UmChlE consisted of 1,758 bp, corresponding to a protein of 585 amino acids, and was functionally produced in Pichia pastoris GS115. Sequence alignments with annotated chlorogenic acid and feruloyl esterases underlined the uniqueness of this enzyme."

"25437809","abstracttext","Gut microbes are known to play various roles in insects such as digestion of inaccessible nutrients, synthesis of deficient amino acids, and interaction with ecological environments, including host plants. Here, we analyzed the gut microbiome in Hessian fly, a serious pest of wheat. A total of 3,654 high quality sequences of the V3 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene were obtained through 454-pyrosequencing. From these sequences, 311 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were obtained at the >97% similarity cutoff. In the gut of 1st instar, otu01, a member of Pseudomonas, was predominant, representing 90.2% of total sequences. otu13, an unidentified genus in the Pseudomonadaceae family, represented 1.9% of total sequences. The remaining OTUs were each less than 1%. In the gut of the 2nd instar, otu01 and otu13 decreased to 85.5% and 1.5%, respectively. otu04, a member of Buttiauxella, represented 9.7% of total sequences. The remaining OTUs were each less than 1%. In the gut of the 3rd instar, otu01 and otu13 further decreased to 29.0% and 0%, respectively. otu06, otu08, and otu16, also three members of the Pseudomonadaceae family were 13.2%, 8.6%, and 2.3%, respectively. In addition, otu04 and otu14, two members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, were 4.7% and 2.5%; otu18 and otu20, two members of the Xanthomonadaceae family, were 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively; otu12, a member of Achromobacter, was 4.2%; otu19, a member of Undibacterium, was 1.4%; and otu9, otu10, and otu15, members of various families, were 6.1%, 6.3%, and 1.9%, respectively. The investigation into dynamics of Pseudomonas, the most abundant genera, revealed that its population level was at peak in freshly hatched or 1 day larvae as well as in later developmental stages, thus suggesting a prominent role for this bacterium in Hessian fly development and in its interaction with host plants. This study is the first comprehensive survey on bacteria associated with the gut of a gall midge, and provides a foundation for future studies to elucidate the roles of gut microbes in Hessian fly virulence and biology."

"25476012","abstracttext_background","Non-host resistance, NHR, to non-adapted pathogens and quantitative host resistance, QR, confer durable protection to plants and are important for securing yield in a longer perspective. However, a more targeted exploitation of the trait usually possessing a complex mode of inheritance by many quantitative trait loci, QTLs, will require a better understanding of the most important genes and alleles."
"25476012","abstracttext_results","Here we present results from a transient-induced gene silencing, TIGS, approach of candidate genes for NHR and QR in barley against the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis. Genes were selected based on transcript regulation, multigene-family membership or genetic map position. Out of 1,144 tested RNAi-target genes, 96 significantly affected resistance to the non-adapted wheat- or the compatible barley powdery mildew fungus, with an overlap of four genes. TIGS results for QR were combined with transcript regulation data, allele-trait associations, QTL co-localization and copy number variation resulting in a meta-dataset of 51 strong candidate genes with convergent evidence for a role in QR."
"25476012","abstracttext_conclusions","This study represents an initial, functional inventory of approximately 3% of the barley transcriptome for a role in NHR or QR against the powdery mildew pathogen. The discovered candidate genes support the idea that QR in this Triticeae host is primarily based on pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity, which is compromised by effector molecules produced by the compatible pathogen. The overlap of four genes with significant TIGS effects both in the NHR and QR screens also indicates shared components for both forms of durable pathogen resistance."

"25467556","abstracttext","Microbial communities involved in biogas production from wheat straw as the sole substrate were investigated. Anaerobic digestion was carried out within an up-flow anaerobic solid-state (UASS) reactor connected to an anaerobic filter (AF) by liquor recirculation. Two lab-scale reactor systems were operated simultaneously at 37 °C and 55 °C. The UASS reactors were fed at a fixed organic loading rate of 2.5 g L(-1) d(-1), based on volatile solids. Molecular genetic analyses of the bacterial and archaeal communities within the UASS reactors (digestate and effluent liquor) and the AFs (biofilm carrier and effluent liquor) were conducted under steady-state conditions. The thermophilic UASS reactor had a considerably higher biogas and methane yield in comparison to the mesophilic UASS, while the mesophilic AF was slightly more productive than the thermophilic AF. When the thermophilic and mesophilic community structures were compared, the thermophilic system was characterized by a higher Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio, as revealed by 16S rRNA gene (rrs) sequence analysis. The composition of the archaeal communities was phase-separated under thermophilic conditions, but rather stage-specific under mesophilic conditions. Family- and order-specific real-time PCR of methanogenic Archaea supported the taxonomic distribution obtained by rrs sequence analysis. The higher anaerobic digestion efficiency of the thermophilic compared to the mesophilic UASS reactor was accompanied by a high abundance of Firmicutes and Methanosarcina sp. in the thermophilic UASS biofilm."

"24983900","abstracttext","Fusarenon-X (FX), a type B trichothecene mycotoxin, is mainly produced by Fusarium crookwellense, which occurs naturally in agricultural commodities, such as wheat and barley. FX has been shown to exert a variety of toxic effects on multiple targets in vitro. However, the embryonic toxicity of FX in vivo remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated FX-induced apoptosis and the relationship between the genetic regulatory mechanisms and FX-induced apoptosis in the developing mouse brain of FX-treated pregnant mice. Pregnant mice were orally administered FX (3.5 mg/kg b.w.) and were assessed at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h after treatment (HAT). Apoptosis in the fetal brain was determined using hematoxylin and eosin staining, the TUNEL method, immunohistochemistry for PCNA and electron microscopy. Gene expressions were evaluated using microarray and real time-reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Histopathological changes showed that the number of apoptotic cells in the telencephalon of the mouse fetus peaked at 12 HAT and decreased at 24 and 48 HAT. FX induced the up-regulation of Bax, Trp53 and Casp9 and down-regulated Bcl2 but the expression levels of Fas and Casp8 mRNA remained unchanged. These data suggested that FX induces apoptosis in the developing mouse brain in FX-treated dams. Moreover, the genetic regulatory mechanisms of FX-induced apoptosis are regulated by Bax, Bcl2, Trp53 and Casp9 or can be defined via an intrinsic apoptotic pathway."

"24985065","abstracttext_key message","Fine mapping by recombinant backcross populations revealed that a preharvest sprouting QTL on 2B contained two QTLs linked in coupling with different effects on the phenotype. Wheat preharvest sprouting (PHS) occurs when grain germinates on the plant before harvest, resulting in reduced grain quality. Previous mapping of quantitative trait locus (QTL) revealed a major PHS QTL, QPhs.cnl-2B.1, located on chromosome 2B significant in 16 environments that explained from 5 to 31 % of the phenotypic variation. The objective of this project was to fine map the QPhs.cnl-2B.1 interval. Fine mapping was carried out in recombinant backcross populations (BC1F4 and BC1F5) that were developed by backcrossing selected doubled haploids to a recurrent parent and self-pollinating the BC1F4 and BC1F5 generations. In each generation, three markers in the QPhs.cnl-2B.1 interval were used to screen for recombinants. Fine mapping revealed that the QPhs.cnl-2B.1 interval contained two PHS QTLs linked in coupling. The distal PHS QTL, located between Wmc453c and Barc55, contributed 8 % of the phenotypic variation and also co-located with a major seed dormancy QTL determined by germination index. The proximal PHS QTL, between Wmc474 and CNL415-rCDPK, contributed 16 % of the variation. Several candidate genes including Mg-chelatase H subunit family protein, GTP-binding protein and calmodulin/Ca(2+)-dependent protein kinase were linked to the PHS QTL. Although many recombinant lines were identified, the lack of polymorphism for markers in the QTL interval prevented the localization of the recombination breakpoints and identification of the gene underlying the phenotype."

"25081835","abstracttext","The bread wheat TaSOS1 has been previously shown to be induced by salt stress treatment. To further investigate the regulation of the TaSOS1 gene, the two genomic fragments Pr SOS1-AB and Pr SOS1-D have been isolated and sequenced. Pr SOS1-AB and Pr SOS1-D are the promoter regions of SOS1 alleles, which are localised on genomes A and/or B, and on genome D, respectively. Sequence analysis of these two promoters revealed the presence of cis-regulatory elements which could be required for abiotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA) responsiveness. Histochemical assays of stably transformed Arabidopsis T3 plants showed that Pr SOS1-AB and Pr SOS1-D are active in this heterologous system, and their activities were almost the same at early developmental stages (4-, 8- and 12-day-old transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings). Nevertheless, β-glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected only in plants carrying the Pr SOS1-AB -gusA construct grown for 20 or 30 days. Furthermore, in these plants, the application of abiotic stress produced an accumulation in gusA transcripts. Taken together, these results show that, in this heterologous dicot system and under normal growth conditions, Pr SOS1-AB and Pr SOS1-D are age-dependent and organ-specific promoters. However, in the presence of different stress conditions, the activities of these two promoters became different and only Pr SOS1-AB is an abiotic stress-inducible promoter at different developmental stages. Thus, Pr SOS1-AB can be used for the development of abiotic stress-tolerant transgenic plants."

"25008985","abstracttext","In soils, bacteria are very abundant and diverse. They are involved in various agro-ecosystem processes such as the nitrogen cycle, organic matter degradation, and soil formation. Yet, little is known about the distribution and composition of bacterial communities through the soil profile, particularly in agricultural soils, as most studies have focused only on topsoils or forest and grassland soils. In the present work, we have used bar-coded pyrosequencing analysis of the V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene to analyze bacterial diversity in a profile (depths 10, 25, and 45 cm) of a well-characterized field of winter wheat. Taxonomic assignment was carried out with the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier program with three bootstrap scores: a main run at 0.80, a confirmation run at 0.99, and a run at 0 to gain information on the unknown bacteria. Our results show that biomass and bacterial quantity and diversity decreased greatly with depth. Depth also had an impact, in terms of relative sequence abundance, on 81 % of the most represented taxonomic ranks, notably the ranks Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteridae, and Acidobacteria. Bacterial community composition differed more strongly between the topsoil (10 and 25 cm) and subsoil (45 cm) than between levels in the topsoil, mainly because of shifts in the carbon, nitrogen, and potassium contents. The subsoil also contained more unknown bacteria, 53.96 % on the average, than did the topsoil, with 42.06 % at 10 cm and 45.59 % at 25 cm. Most of these unknown bacteria seem to belong to Deltaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Rhizobiales, and Acidobacteria."

"25459907","abstracttext","Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) increases lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in the rumen, which might translocate into the systemic circulation, triggering a cascade of clinical and immunological alterations. The objective of this study was to characterize the clinical immune and metabolic responses to ruminal-derived lipopolysaccharide in nonlactating cows induced with SARA using 2 challenges, a grain-based SARA challenge (GBSC) or an alfalfa-pellet SARA challenge (APSC). Six dry, nonlactating Holstein cows were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square arrangement of treatments with 4-wk experimental cycles. All cows received the control diet containing 70% forage and 30% mixed concentrates (dry matter basis) for 3 wk. In wk 4, cows received a control diet, GBSC (38% wheat-barley pellets, 32% other mixed concentrate, and 30% forages), or APSC (45% mixed concentrate, 32% alfalfa pellets, and 23% other forages). Total plasma proteins and immunology-related proteins, acute phase proteins, blood cells, serum chemistry, mRNA gene expression of peripheral blood cell surface markers, and selected proinflammatory cytokines were evaluated. Ruminal pH was lower in both groups with induced SARA compared with a control group. Ruminal endotoxins were higher in GBSC; however, plasma endotoxin was not detected in any study group. No significant differences in feed intake, rectal temperature, white blood cell counts, or differentials were found between control and SARA challenge groups; changes in glucose, urea, Ca, and Mg were observed in SARA groups. Total plasma proteins were lower in both SARA groups, and acute phase proteins were higher in GBSC. The expression of CD14, MD2, and TLR4 mRNA in peripheral blood leukocytes was not affected by SARA induction. The induction of SARA as a result of GBSC or APSC challenge was successful; however, LPS was not detected in plasma. Changes in clinical, metabolic, and inflammatory responses were not observed in the SARA-challenged cows, suggesting that, in this study, SARA was not associated with a systemic response to inflammation."
"25237109","articletitle","Whole-genome analysis of multienvironment or multitrait QTL in MAGIC."
"25237109","abstracttext","Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) populations are now being utilized to more accurately identify the underlying genetic basis of quantitative traits through quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses and subsequent gene discovery. The expanded genetic diversity present in such populations and the amplified number of recombination events mean that QTL can be identified at a higher resolution. Most QTL analyses are conducted separately for each trait within a single environment. Separate analysis does not take advantage of the underlying correlation structure found in multienvironment or multitrait data. By using this information in a joint analysis-be it multienvironment or multitrait - it is possible to gain a greater understanding of genotype- or QTL-by-environment interactions or of pleiotropic effects across traits. Furthermore, this can result in improvements in accuracy for a range of traits or in a specific target environment and can influence selection decisions. Data derived from MAGIC populations allow for founder probabilities of all founder alleles to be calculated for each individual within the population. This presents an additional layer of complexity and information that can be utilized to identify QTL. A whole-genome approach is proposed for multienvironment and multitrait QTL analysis in MAGIC. The whole-genome approach simultaneously incorporates all founder probabilities at each marker for all individuals in the analysis, rather than using a genome scan. A dimension reduction technique is implemented, which allows for high-dimensional genetic data. For each QTL identified, sizes of effects for each founder allele, the percentage of genetic variance explained, and a score to reflect the strength of the QTL are found. The approach was demonstrated to perform well in a small simulation study and for two experiments, using a wheat MAGIC population."

However, the diverse chemical composition and complex structure of crop residues are more challenging for efficient degradation by microbes than are homogeneous polysaccharides. In this study, the transcriptional responses of Neurospora crassa to various plant straws were analyzed using RNA-Seq, and novel beneficial factors for biomass-induced enzyme production were evaluated."
"25691917","abstracttext_results","Comparative transcriptional profiling of N. crassa grown on five major crop straws of China (barley, corn, rice, soybean, and wheat straws) revealed a highly overlapping group of 430 genes, the biomass commonly induced core set (BICS). A large proportion of induced carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) genes (82 out of 113) were also conserved across the five plant straws. Excluding 178 genes within the BICS that were also upregulated under no-carbon conditions, the remaining 252 genes were defined as the biomass regulon (BR). Interestingly, 88 genes were only induced by plant biomass and not by three individual polysaccharides (Avicel, xylan, and pectin); these were denoted as the biomass unique set (BUS). Deletion of one BUS gene, the transcriptional regulator rca-1, significantly improved lignocellulase production using plant biomass as the sole carbon source, possibly functioning via de-repression of the regulator clr-2.

"25711680","abstracttext","The gut immune system and its modification by diet have been implicated in the pathogenesis of type 1 diabetes (T1D). Therefore, we investigated gut immune status in non-diabetes-prone LEW.1AR1 and diabetes-prone LEW.1AR1-iddm rats and evaluated the effect of a low antigen, hydrolysed casein (HC)-based diet on gut immunity and T1D. Rats were weaned onto a cereal-based or HC-based diet and monitored for T1D. Strain and dietary effects on immune homeostasis were assessed in non-diabetic rats (50-60 days old) and rats with recent-onset diabetes using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Immune gene expression was analysed in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and jejunum using quantitative RT-PCR and PCR arrays. T1D was prevented in LEW.1AR1-iddm rats by feeding an HC diet. Diabetic LEW.1AR1-iddm rats had fewer lymphoid tissue T cells compared with LEW.1AR1 rats. The percentage of CD4(+)  Foxp3(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells was decreased in pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) of diabetic rats. The jejunum of 50-day LEW.1AR1-iddm rats contained fewer CD3(+) T cells, CD163(+) M2 macrophages and Foxp3(+) Treg cells. Ifng expression was increased in MLN and Foxp3 expression was decreased in the jejunum of LEW.1AR1-iddm rats; Ifng/Il4 was decreased in jejunum of LEW.1AR1-iddm rats fed HC. PCR arrays revealed decreased expression of M2-associated macrophage factors in 50-day LEW.1AR1-iddm rats. Wheat peptides stimulated T-cell proliferation and activation in MLN and PLN cells from diabetic LEW.1AR1-iddm rats. LEW.1AR1-iddm rats displayed gut immune cell deficits and decreased immunoregulatory capacity, which were partially corrected in animals fed a low antigen, protective HC diet consistent with other models of T1D."

"25360032","abstracttext","Melanin plays an important role in virulence and antimicrobial resistance in several fungal pathogens. The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici is important worldwide, but little is known about the genetic architecture of pathogenicity, including the production of melanin. Because melanin production can exhibit complex inheritance, we used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping in two crosses to identify the underlying genes. Restriction site-associated DNA sequencing was used to genotype 263 (cross 1) and 261 (cross 2) progeny at ~8500 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and construct two dense linkage maps. We measured gray values, representing degrees of melanization, for single-spore colonies growing on Petri dishes by using a novel image-processing approach that enabled high-throughput phenotyping. Because melanin production can be affected by stress, each offspring was grown in two stressful environments and one control environment. We detected six significant QTL in cross 1 and nine in cross 2, with three QTL shared between the crosses. Different QTL were identified in different environments and at different colony ages. By obtaining complete genome sequences for the four parents and analyzing sequence variation in the QTL confidence intervals, we identified 16 candidate genes likely to affect melanization. One of these candidates was PKS1, a polyketide synthase gene known to play a role in the synthesis of dihydroxynaphthalene melanin. Three candidate quantitative trait nucleotides were identified in PKS1. Many of the other candidate genes were not previously associated with melanization."

"25403517","abstracttext","Aristolochic acid (AA) is a potent dietary cytotoxin and carcinogen, and an established etiological agent underlying severe human nephropathies and associated upper urinary tract urothelial cancers, collectively designated aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN). Its genome-wide mutational signature, marked by predominant A:T > T:A transversions occurring in the 5'-CpApG-3' trinucleotide context and enriched on the nontranscribed gene strand, has been identified in human upper urinary tract urothelial carcinomas from East Asian patients and in experimental systems. Here we report a whole-exome sequencing screen performed on DNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded renal cell carcinomas (RCC) arising in chronic renal disease patients from a Balkan endemic nephropathy (EN) region. In the EN regions, the disease results from the consumption of bread made from wheat contaminated by seeds of Aristolochia clematitis, an AA-containing plant. In five of eight (62.5%) tested RCC tumor specimens, we observed the characteristic global mutational signature consistent with the mutagenic effects of AA. This signature was absent in the control RCC samples obtained from patients from a nonendemic, metropolitan region. By identifying a new tumor type associated with the AA-driven genome-wide mutagenic process in the context of renal disease, our results suggest new epidemiological and public health implications for the RCC incidence worldwide, particularly for the high-risk regions with unregulated use of AA-containing traditional herbal medicines."

"25413715","abstracttext","A bacterial strain, designated LYBFD3-16A2(T), was isolated from tribenuron methyl contaminated wheat soil. Cells were observed to be Gram-negative short rods with a single flagellum. The strain was found to utilize methanol, glucose, maltose and mannitol as carbon and energy sources, and utilized glutamate, leucine, phenylalanine as organic nitrogen sources. Strain LYBFD3-16A2(T) was found to be aerobic, to form urease, produce hydrogen sulfide and reduce nitrate to nitrite. The indole test in tryptone broth was observed to be positive. The major cellular fatty acids were identified as C18:1ω7c (81.3 %), 11-methylC18:1ω7c (7.9 %), C18:0 (3.0 %) and C16:0 (3.0 %). The major phospholipids were identified as phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidyglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The main ubiquinone was identified as Q-10. The DNA G+C content was determined to be between 70.2 and 70.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated the affiliation of strain LYBFD3-16A2 to members of the genus Methylopila. The DNA-DNA hybridization values of the novel strain with the type strains of the most closely related species Methylopila musalis MUSA(T) and Methylopila jiangsuensis JZL-4(T) were 35.4 % and 31.4 % respectively. The genotypic and phenotypic characterization, along with chemotaxonomic properties of strain LYBFD3-16A2(T), showed that the strain represents a novel species of the genus Methylopila for which the name Methylopila henanense sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is LYBFD3-16A2(T) (=CGMCC1.10703(T) = LMG 25959(T))."

"26061358","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, endogenous, non-coding RNA molecules that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. As high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS) and Big Data rapidly accumulate for various species, efforts for in silico identification of miRNAs intensify. Surprisingly, the effect of the input genomics sequence on the robustness of miRNA prediction was not evaluated in detail to date. In the present study, we performed a homology-based miRNA and isomiRNA prediction of the 5D chromosome of bread wheat progenitor, Aegilops tauschii, using two distinct sequence data sets as input: (1) raw sequence reads obtained from 454-GS FLX Titanium sequencing platform and (2) an assembly constructed from these reads. We also compared this method with a number of available plant sequence datasets. We report here the identification of 62 and 22 miRNAs from raw reads and the assembly, respectively, of which 16 were predicted with high confidence from both datasets. While raw reads promoted sensitivity with the high number of miRNAs predicted, 55% (12 out of 22) of the assembly-based predictions were supported by previous observations, bringing specificity forward compared to the read-based predictions, of which only 37% were supported. Importantly, raw reads could identify several repeat-related miRNAs that could not be detected with the assembly. However, raw reads could not capture 6 miRNAs, for which the stem-loops could only be covered by the relatively longer sequences from the assembly. In summary, the comparison of miRNA datasets obtained by these two strategies revealed that utilization of raw reads, as well as assemblies for in silico prediction, have distinct advantages and disadvantages. Consideration of these important nuances can benefit future miRNA identification efforts in the current age of NGS and Big Data driven life sciences innovation."

"26026764","abstracttext","Prepartal energy overfeeding may predispose cows to a state of increased insulin resistance with greater lipolysis after parturition. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of prepartal overfeeding in terms of abundant grass silage ration on the liver and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) gene expression around parturition. Sixteen multiparous Finnish Ayrshire dairy cows were fed ad libitum either grass silage [high energy, HE; 144 MJ/d of metabolizable energy (ME) intake, n=8] or a mixture of grass silage, wheat straw, and rapeseed meal [55:40:5 (CON), 109 MJ/d of ME, n=8] during the dry period (58.2±4.89 d, mean ± standard deviation). Tissue biopsies and blood samples were collected at -14 (±4.98), 1, and 7 d relative to the actual parturition date. The HE cows had greater total dry matter intake, ME intake, and ME balance during the dry period than the CON cows. Compared with CON, the increases in body weight and body condition score were greater in HE during the dry period. Milk yield during the first 2 wk of lactation was not different between the groups. Plasma glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, insulin, glucagon, and β-hydroxybutyrate did not differ between the groups during the transition period. Dietary treatment did not affect hepatic triglyceride content; however, a delayed increase in hepatic total lipid content was observed in the HE cows at d 1 postpartum. Hepatic cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 mRNA expression was lower in HE than in CON at d 1 and 7 postpartum. Adiponectin receptor 1 and 2 mRNA abundance tended to be lower in SAT of HE than CON. Lower lipoprotein lipase, leptin, and stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase mRNA abundances were observed at d 7 postpartum in SAT of the HE cows compared with the CON cows. We concluded that prepartal ad libitum feeding of grass silage may decrease insulin sensitivity and lipogenesis in SAT during peripartal period and may attenuate the increase of hepatic gluconeogenic capacity from propionate compared with a controlled-energy diet."

"25606009","abstracttext","Red ginseng (Panax ginseng), a Korean traditional medicinal plant, contains a variety of ginsenosides as major functional components. It is necessary to remove sugar moieties from the major ginsenosides, which have a lower absorption rate into the intestine, to obtain the aglycone form. To screen for microorganisms showing bioconversion activity for ginsenosides from red ginseng, 50 yeast strains were isolated from Korean traditional meju (a starter culture made with soybean and wheat flour for the fermentation of soybean paste). Twenty strains in which a black zone formed around the colony on esculin-yeast malt agar plates were screened first, and among them 5 strains having high β-glucosidase activity on p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside as a substrate were then selected. Strain JNO301 was finally chosen as a bioconverting strain in this study on the basis of its high bioconversion activity for red ginseng extract as determined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis. The selected bioconversion strain was identified as Candida allociferrii JNO301 based on the nucleotide sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene. The optimum temperature and pH for the cell growth were 20~30℃ and pH 5~8, respectively. TLC analysis confirmed that C. allociferrii JNO301 converted ginsenoside Rb1 into Rd and then into F2, Rb2 into compound O, Rc into compound Mc1, and Rf into Rh1. Quantitative analysis using high-performance liquid chromatography showed that bioconversion of red ginseng extract resulted in an increase of 2.73, 3.32, 33.87, 16, and 5.48 fold in the concentration of Rd, F2, compound O, compound Mc1, and Rh1, respectively."

"25644466","abstracttext","The cytochrome P450 gene CYP81A6 confers tolerance to bentazon and metsulfuron-methyl, two selective herbicides widely used for weed control in rice and wheat fields. Knockout mutants of CYP81A6 are highly susceptible to both herbicides. The present study aimed to characterize the CYP81A6 expression in rice. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses demonstrated that foliar treatment of bentazon (500 mg/L) greatly induced expression of CYP81A6 in both wild-type (Jiazhe B) and its knockout mutant (Jiazhe mB): a 10-fold increase at 9 h before returning to basal levels at 24 h in Jiazhe B, while in the mutant the expression level rose to >20-fold at 12 h and maintained at such high level up to 24 h post exposure. In contrast, metsulfuron-methyl (500 mg/L) treatment did not affect the expression of CYP81A6 in Jiazhe B within 80 h; thereafter the expression peaked at 120 h and returned gradually to basal levels by Day 6. We suggest that a metabolite of metsulfuron-methyl, 1H-2,3-benzothiazin-4-(3H)-one-2,2-dioxide, is likely to be responsible for inducing CYP81A6 expression, rather than the metsulfuron-methyl itself. Use of a promoter-GUS reporter construct (CYP81A6Pro::GUS) demonstrated that CYP81A6 was constitutively expressed throughout the plant, with the highest expression in the upper surfaces of leaves. Subcellular localization studies in rice protoplasts showed that CYP81A6 was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. These observations advance our understanding of CYP81A6 expression in rice, particularly its response to the two herbicides."

An ACCD bacterial strain, SBP-8, identified as Klebsiella sp., also having other plant-growth-promoting activities, was isolated from Sorghum bicolor growing in the desertregion of Rajasthan, India. ACCD activity of SBP-8 was characterized at biochemical, physiological, and molecular levels. The presence of AcdS, a structural gene for ACCD, was confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction. Strain SBP-8 showed optimum growth and ACCD activity at increased salt (NaCl) concentrations of up to 6%, indicating its potential to survive and associate with plants growing in saline soil. Inoculation of wheat plants with SBP-8 when grow in the presence of salt (150-200 mM) and temperature (30-40 °C) stressors resulted inamelioration of stress conditions by increasing plant biomass and chlorophyll content, and are duction in plant growth inhibition (10-100%) occurred due to salt and temperature stressors. Moreover, strain SBP-8 also caused Na(+) exclusion (65%) and increased uptake of K(+) (84.21%) in the host plant. This property can protect plants from adverse effects of Na(+) on plant growth and physiology. Thus, SBP-8 improves growth of the host plant and protects from salt stressors through more than one mechanism including an effect of ACCD activity and on K(+)/Na(+) ratio in plants. The colonization efficiency of strain SBP-8 was confirmedby CFU (colony-forming unit) count, microscopy, and ERIC-PCR based DNA-finger-printing approach. Therefore, and the use of efficient colonizing plant-growth-promoting bacteria may provideinsights into possible biotechnological approaches to decrease the impact of salinity and other stressors."

Many proteins, particularly transcription regulatory factors involved in these processes, were identified and genetically engineered in Penicillium oxalicum and other cellulolytic fungi. Despite such great efforts, its effect of modifying a single target to improve the production of cellulase is highly limited."
"25949521","abstracttext_results","In this study, we developed a systematic strategy for the genetic engineering of P. oxalicum to enhance cellulase yields, by enhancing induction (by blocking intracellular inducer hydrolysis and increasing the activator level) and relieving the repression. We obtained a trigenic recombinant strain named 'RE-10' by deleting bgl2 and creA, along with over-expressing the gene clrB. The cellulolytic ability of RE-10 was significantly improved; the filter paper activity and extracellular protein concentration increased by up to over 20- and 10-fold, respectively, higher than those of the wild-type (WT) strain 114-2 both on pure cellulose and complex wheat bran media. Most strikingly, the cellulolytic ability of RE-10 was comparable with that of the industrial P. oxalicum strain JU-A10-T obtained by random mutagenesis. Comparative proteomics analysis provided further insights into the differential secretomes between RE-10 and WT strains. In particular, the enzymes and accessory proteins involved in lignocellulose degradation were elevated specifically and dramatically in the recombinant, thereby confirming the importance of them in biomass deconstruction and implying a possible co-regulatory mechanism."

"25859251","articletitle","Genetic diversity in tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter]."
"25859251","abstracttext","Tef [Eragrostis tef (Zucc.) Trotter] is a cereal crop resilient to adverse climatic and soil conditions, and possessing desirable storage properties. Although tef provides high quality food and grows under marginal conditions unsuitable for other cereals, it is considered to be an orphan crop because it has benefited little from genetic improvement. Hence, unlike other cereals such as maize and wheat, the productivity of tef is extremely low. In spite of the low productivity, tef is widely cultivated by over six million small-scale farmers in Ethiopia where it is annually grown on more than three million hectares of land, accounting for over 30% of the total cereal acreage. Tef, a tetraploid with 40 chromosomes (2n = 4x = 40), belongs to the family Poaceae and, together with finger millet (Eleusine coracana Gaerth.), to the subfamily Chloridoideae. It was originated and domesticated in Ethiopia. There are about 350 Eragrostis species of which E. tef is the only species cultivated for human consumption. At the present time, the gene bank in Ethiopia holds over five thousand tef accessions collected from geographical regions diverse in terms of climate and elevation. These germplasm accessions appear to have huge variability with regard to key agronomic and nutritional traits. In order to properly utilize the variability in developing new tef cultivars, various techniques have been implemented to catalog the extent and unravel the patterns of genetic diversity. In this review, we show some recent initiatives investigating the diversity of tef using genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics and discuss the prospect of these efforts in providing molecular resources that can aid modern tef breeding."
"25702698","articletitle","Drought-resistant cereals: impact on water sustainability and nutritional quality."
"25702698","abstracttext","This review uses production and climate data to examine global and local production trends that can be related to events such as drought. UK grain quality data is also available and provides an overview of trends in protein content. Literature surveys show a consistent reduction in grain size due to the effects of temperature and/or drought. A review of gene expression studies showed that most genes involved in starch synthesis are down regulated under heat stress. Net protein production is also reduced under heat and/or drought stress but apparently to a lesser degree as the reduction in grain mass is larger, resulting in an increase in protein concentration. Modelling has suggested that adaptation could be achieved by moving production to more extreme latitudes but other research suggests that simply transferring germplasm from one region to another is unlikely to be successful. Another review has identified drought tolerance phenotypes that could be used to breed more drought tolerant crops. At the time of the review, the authors concluded that phenotypic selection was generally preferable to forms of marker-assisted breeding and have used the approach to produce drought tolerant wheat cultivars. Transgenic approaches have also been shown to improve drought tolerance under controlled environment conditions but there are no results to show how well these results translate into improved crop performance under field conditions. The recent advances in genomic data and detecting marker-trait associations suggest that marker-assisted breeding will play a much more important role in breeding drought tolerant cereals in the future."

"25557787","abstracttext","One hundred and seven mesophilic isolates of Clostridium were isolated from agricultural soils cultivated with different plants in Assuit Governorate, Egypt. Eighty isolates (out of 107) showed the ability to produce ABE (Acetone, butanol and ethanol) on T6 medium ranging from 0.036 to 31.89 g/L. The highest numbers of ABE producing isolates were obtained from soil samples of potato contributing 27 isolates, followed by 18 isolates from wheat and 10 isolates from onion. On the other hand, there were three native isolates that produced ABE more than those produced by the reference isolate Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 (11.543 g/L). The three isolates were identified based on phenotypic and gene encoding 16S rRNA as Clostridium beijerinckii ASU10 (KF372577), Clostridium chauvoei ASU55 (KF372580) and Clostridium roseum ASU58 (KF372581). The highest ABE level from substandard and surplus dates was produced by C. beijerinckii ASU10 (24.07 g/L) comprising butanol 67.15% (16.16 g/L), acetone 30.73% (7.4 g/L) and ethanol 2.12% (0.51 g/L), while C. roseum ASU58 and C. chauvoei ASU55 produced ABE contributing 20.20 and 13.79 g/L, respectively. ABE production by C. acetobutylicum ATCC 824 was 15.01 g/L. This study proved that the native strains C. beijerinckii ASU10 and C. roseum ASU58 have high competitive efficacy on ABE production from economical substrate as substandard and surplus date fruits. Additionally, using this substrate without any nutritional components is considered to be a commercial substrate for desired ABE production."
"25886396","articletitle","Sweet potato SPAP1 is a typical aspartic protease and participates in ethephon-mediated leaf senescence."
"25886396","abstracttext","Plant aspartic proteases are generally divided into three categories: typical, nucellin-like, and atypical aspartic proteases based on their gene and protein structures. In this report, a full-length cDNA SPAP1 was cloned from sweet potato leaves, which contained 1515 nucleotides (504 amino acids) and exhibited high amino acid sequence identity (ca. 51-72%) with plant typical aspartic proteases, including tomato LeAspP, potato StAsp, and wheat WAP2. SPAP1 also contained conserved DTG and DSG amino acid residues within its catalytic domain and plant specific insert (PSI) at the C-terminus. The cDNA corresponding to the mature protein (starting from the 66th to 311th amino acid residues) without PSI domain was constructed with pET30a expression vector for fusion protein and antibody production. RT-PCR and protein blot hybridization showed that SPAP1 expression level was the highest in L3 mature leaves, then gradually declined until L5 completely yellow leaves. Ethephon, an ethylene-releasing compound, also enhanced SPAP1 expression at the time much earlier than the onset of leaf senescence. Exogenous application of SPAP1 fusion protein promoted ethephon-induced leaf senescence, which could be abolished by pre-treatment of SPAP1 fusion protein with (a) 95 °C for 5 min, (b) aspartic protease inhibitor pepstatin A, and (c) anti-SPAP1 antibody, respectively. Exogenous SPAP1 fusion protein, whereas, did not significantly affect leaf senescence under dark. These data conclude that sweet potato SPAP1 is a functional typical aspartic protease and participates in ethephon-mediated leaf senescence. The SPAP1-promoted leaf senescence and its activity are likely not associated with the PSI domain. Interaction of ethephon-inducible components for effective SPAP1 promotion on leaf senescence is also suggested."
"26886933","articletitle","Bread Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Grain Protein Concentration Is Related to Early Post-Flowering Nitrate Uptake under Putative Control of Plant Satiety Level."
"26886933","abstracttext","The strong negative correlation between grain protein concentration (GPC) and grain yield (GY) in bread wheat complicates the simultaneous improvement of these traits. However, earlier studies have concluded that the deviation from this relationship (grain protein deviation or GPD) has strong genetic basis. Genotypes with positive GPD have an increased ability to uptake nitrogen (N) during the post-flowering period independently of the amount of N taken up before flowering, suggesting that genetic variability for N satiety could enable the breakage of the negative relationship. This study is based on two genotypes markedly contrasted for GPD grown under semi-hydroponic conditions differentiated for nitrate availability both before and after flowering. This allows exploration of the genetic determinants of post-flowering N uptake (PANU) by combining whole plant sampling and targeted gene expression approaches. The results highlights the correlation (r² = 0.81) with GPC of PANU occurring early during grain development (flowering-flowering + 250 degree-days) independently of GY. Early PANU was in turn correlated (r² = 0.80) to the stem-biomass increment after flowering through its effect on N sink activity. Differences in early PANU between genotypes, despite comparable N statuses at flowering, suggest that genetic differences in N satiety could be involved in the establishment of the GPC. Through its strong negative correlation with genes implied in N assimilation, root nitrate concentration appears to be a good marker for evaluating instantaneous plant N demand, and may provide valuable information on the genotypic N satiety level. This trait may help breeders to identify genotypes having high GPC independently of their GY."

The aim of the study was to investigate the bacterial community compositions of the crop, gizzard, ileum, and cecum contents in relation to the feeding strategy and age (8, 15, 22, 25, 29, or 36 days). Among the four dietary treatments, bacterial diversity was analyzed for MBF and CKMS-30 by 454 pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Since the diets had no significant influence on bacterial diversity, data were pooled for downstream analysis. With increasing age, a clear succession of bacterial communities and increased bacterial diversity were observed.Lactobacillaceae(belonging mainly to the genus Lactobacillus) represented most of the Firmicutesat all ages and in all segments of the gut except the cecum. The development of a ""mature"" microbiota in broilers occurred during the period from days 15 to 22. Striking increases in the relative abundances of Lactobacillus salivarius(17 to 36%) and clostridia (11 to 18%), and a concomitant decrease in the relative abundance of Lactobacillus reuteri, were found in the ileum after day 15. The concentration of deconjugated bile salts increased in association with the increased populations of L. salivarius and clostridia. Both L. salivarius and clostridia deconjugate bile acids, and increases in the abundances of these bacteria might be associated with growth reduction and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders occurring in the critical period of broiler life between days 20 and 30."

The coverage of the glycocalyx, determined by the area analysis of the fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-FITC) staining to the cryosections of rat vessels, showed a 27.2% increase in the common carotid artery, a 13.3 and 8.0% decrease in the corresponding abdominal aorta and the femoral artery after 3 wk of tail suspension. The relative mRNA levels of syndecan-2, 3, 4, glypican-1, smooth muscle protein 22 (SM22), smoothelin (SMTN), and calponin were enhanced to 1.40, 1.53, 1.70, 1.90, 2.93, 2.30, and 5.23-fold, respectively, in the common carotid artery of the TS rat. However, both glycocalyx-related genes and smooth muscle contractile apparatus were totally or partially downregulated in the abdominal aorta and femoral artery of the TS rat. A linear positive correlation between the normalized coverage of glycocalyx and normalized mRNA levels of SM22, SMTN, and calponin exists. These results suggest the regional-dependent adaptation of the glycocalyx in simulated microgravity condition, which may affect its mechanotransduction of shear stress to regulate the contractility of the smooth muscle, finally contributing to postspaceflight orthostatic intolerance."

"26442453","abstracttext","The neurohypophysial hormone oxytocin (OXT) and its receptor (OXTR) have critical roles in the regulation of pro-social behaviors, including social recognition, pair bonding, parental behavior, and stress-related responses. Supporting this hypothesis, a portion of patients suffering from autism spectrum disorder have mutations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or epigenetic modifications in their OXTR gene. We previously reported that OXTR-deficient mice exhibit pervasive social deficits, indicating the critical role of OXTR in social behaviors. In the present study, we generated Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre knock-in mice, expressing both OXTR and Cre recombinase under the control of the endogenous Oxtr promoter. Knock-in cassette of Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre consisted of Oxtr cDNA tagged with the hemagglutinin epitope at the 3' end (Oxtr cDNA(HA)), internal ribosomal entry site (Ires), and Cre. Cre was expressed in the uterus, mammary gland, kidney, and brain of Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre knock-in mice. Furthermore, the distribution of Cre in the brain was similar to that observed in Oxtr-Venus fluorescent protein expressing mice (Oxtr-Venus), another animal model previously generated by our group. Social behavior of Oxtr cDNA(HA)-Ires-Cre knock-in mice was similar to that of wild-type animals. We demonstrated that this construct is expressed in OXTR-expressing neurons specifically after an infection with the recombinant adeno-associated virus carrying the flip-excision switch vector. Using this system, we showed the transport of the wheat-germ agglutinin tracing molecule from the OXTR-expressing neurons to the innervated neurons in knock-in mice. This study might contribute to the monosynaptic analysis of neuronal circuits and to the optogenetic analysis of neurons expressing OXTR."

"26442792","abstracttext","Using a combination of de novo transcriptome assembly, a newly developed 9495-marker transcriptome SNP genetic linkage map and comparative genomics approaches, we developed an ordered set of nonredundant transcripts for each of the subgenomes of hexaploid wheat: A (47 160 unigenes), B (59 663 unigenes) and D (40 588 unigenes). We used these as reference sequences against which to map Illumina mRNA-Seq reads derived from young leaf tissue. Transcript abundance was quantified for each unigene. Using a three-way reciprocal BLAST approach, 15 527 triplet sets of homoeologues (one from each genome) were identified. Differential expression (P < 0.05) was identified for 5248 unigenes, with 2906 represented at greater abundance than their two homoeologues and 2342 represented at lower abundance than their two homoeologues. Analysis of gene ontology terms revealed no biases between homoeologues. There was no evidence of genomewide dominance effects, rather the more highly transcribed individual genes were distributed throughout all three genomes. Transcriptome display tile plot, a visualization approach based on CMYK colour space, was developed and used to assess the genome for regions of skewed homoeologue transcript abundance. Extensive striation was revealed, indicative of many small regions of genome dominance (transcripts of homoeologues from one genome more abundant than the others) and many larger regions of genome repression (transcripts of homoeologues from one genome less abundant than the others)."

"26428861","abstracttext_background","The Asian rice gall midge (Orseolia oryzae) is a destructive insect pest of rice. Gall midge infestation in rice triggers either compatible or incompatible interactions leading to survival or mortality of the feeding maggots, respectively. In incompatible interactions, generation of plant allelochemicals/defense molecules and/or inability of the maggots to continue feeding on the host initiate(s) apoptosis within the maggots. Unraveling these molecular events, triggered within the maggots as a response to feeding on resistant hosts, will enable us to obtain a better understanding of host resistance. The present study points towards the likely involvement of a defender against apoptotic cell death gene (DAD1) in the insect in response to the host defense."
"26428861","abstracttext_results","The cDNA coding for the DAD1 orthologue in the rice gall midge (OoDAD1) consisted of 339 nucleotides with one intron of 85 bp and two exons of 208 and 131 nucleotides. The deduced amino acid sequence of OoDAD1 showed a high degree of homology (94.6%) with DAD1 orthologue from the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor)--a major dipteran pest of wheat. Southern hybridization analysis indicated that OoDAD1 was present as a single copy in the genomes of the Asian rice gall midge biotypes (GMB) 1, 4 and 4 M. In the interactions involving GMB4 with Jaya (susceptible rice host) the expression level of OoDAD1 in feeding maggots gradually increased to 3-fold at 96 hai (hours after infestation) and peaked to 3.5-fold at 96 hai when compared to that at 24 hai. In contrast, expression in maggots feeding on RP2068 (resistant host) showed a steep increase of more than 8-fold at 24 hai and this level was sustained at 48, 72 and 96 hai when compared with the level in maggots feeding on Jaya at 24 hai. Recombinant OoDAD1, expressed in E. coli cells, when injected into rice seedlings induced a hypersensitive response (HR) in the resistant rice host, RP2068, but not in the susceptible rice variety, Jaya."
"26428861","abstracttext_conclusions","The results indicate that the expression of OoDAD1 is triggered in the feeding maggots probably due to the host resistance response and therefore, is likely an important molecule in the initial stages of the interaction between the midge and its rice host."

"26430472","abstracttext_background","Supernumerary chromosomes have been found in many organisms. In fungi, these ""accessory"" or ""dispensable"" chromosomes are present at different frequencies in populations and are usually characterized by higher repetitive DNA content and lower gene density when compared to the core chromosomes. In the reference strain of the wheat pathogen, Zymoseptoria tritici, eight discrete accessory chromosomes have been found. So far, no functional role has been assigned to these chromosomes; however, they have existed as separate entities in the karyotypes of Zymoseptoria species over evolutionary time. In this study, we addressed what-if anything-distinguishes the chromatin of accessory chromosomes from core chromosomes. We used chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with high-throughput sequencing (""ChIP-seq"") of DNA associated with the centromere-specific histone H3, CENP-A (CenH3), to identify centromeric DNA, and ChIP-seq with antibodies against dimethylated H3K4, trimethylated H3K9 and trimethylated H3K27 to determine the relative distribution and proportion of euchromatin, obligate and facultative heterochromatin, respectively."
"26430472","abstracttext_results","Centromeres of the eight accessory chromosomes have the same sequence composition and structure as centromeres of the 13 core chromosomes and they are of similar length. Unlike those of most other fungi, Z. tritici centromeres are not composed entirely of repetitive DNA; some centromeres contain only unique DNA sequences, and bona fide expressed genes are located in regions enriched with CenH3. By fluorescence microscopy, we showed that centromeres of Z. tritici do not cluster into a single chromocenter during interphase. We found dramatically higher enrichment of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 on the accessory chromosomes, consistent with the twofold higher proportion of repetitive DNA and poorly transcribed genes. In contrast, no single histone modification tested here correlated with the distribution of centromeric nucleosomes."
"26430472","abstracttext_conclusions","All centromeres are similar in length and composed of a mixture of unique and repeat DNA, and most contain actively transcribed genes. Centromeres, subtelomeric regions or telomere repeat length cannot account for the differences in transfer fidelity between core and accessory chromosomes, but accessory chromosomes are greatly enriched in nucleosomes with H3K27 trimethylation. Genes on accessory chromosomes appear to be silenced by trimethylation of H3K9 and H3K27."

"27113999","abstracttext","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly heritable psychiatric condition with negative lifetime outcomes. Uncovering its genetic architecture should yield important insights into the neurobiology of ADHD and assist development of novel treatment strategies. Twenty years of candidate gene investigations and more recently genome-wide association studies have identified an array of potential association signals. In this context, separating the likely true from false associations ('the wheat' from 'the chaff') will be crucial for uncovering the functional biology of ADHD. Here, we defined a set of 2070 DNA variants that showed evidence of association with ADHD (or were in linkage disequilibrium). More than 97% of these variants were noncoding, and were prioritised for further exploration using two tools-genome-wide annotation of variants (GWAVA) and Combined Annotation-Dependent Depletion (CADD)-that were recently developed to rank variants based upon their likely pathogenicity. Capitalising on recent efforts such as the Encyclopaedia of DNA Elements and US National Institutes of Health Roadmap Epigenomics Projects to improve understanding of the noncoding genome, we subsequently identified 65 variants to which we assigned functional annotations, based upon their likely impact on alternative splicing, transcription factor binding and translational regulation. We propose that these 65 variants, which possess not only a high likelihood of pathogenicity but also readily testable functional hypotheses, represent a tractable shortlist for future experimental validation in ADHD. Taken together, this study brings into sharp focus the likely relevance of noncoding variants for the genetic risk associated with ADHD, and more broadly suggests a bioinformatics approach that should be relevant to other psychiatric disorders."

"27058959","abstracttext","PRP4 encodes the only kinase among the spliceosome components. Although it is an essential gene in the fission yeast and other eukaryotic organisms, the Fgprp4 mutant was viable in the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum. Deletion of FgPRP4 did not block intron splicing but affected intron splicing efficiency in over 60% of the F. graminearum genes. The Fgprp4 mutant had severe growth defects and produced spontaneous suppressors that were recovered in growth rate. Suppressor mutations were identified in the PRP6, PRP31, BRR2, and PRP8 orthologs in nine suppressor strains by sequencing analysis with candidate tri-snRNP component genes. The Q86K mutation in FgMSL1 was identified by whole genome sequencing in suppressor mutant S3. Whereas two of the suppressor mutations in FgBrr2 and FgPrp8 were similar to those characterized in their orthologs in yeasts, suppressor mutations in Prp6 and Prp31 orthologs or FgMSL1 have not been reported. Interestingly, four and two suppressor mutations identified in FgPrp6 and FgPrp31, respectively, all are near the conserved Prp4-phosphorylation sites, suggesting that these mutations may have similar effects with phosphorylation by Prp4 kinase. In FgPrp31, the non-sense mutation at R464 resulted in the truncation of the C-terminal 130 aa region that contains all the conserved Prp4-phosphorylation sites. Deletion analysis showed that the N-terminal 310-aa rich in SR residues plays a critical role in the localization and functions of FgPrp4. We also conducted phosphoproteomics analysis with FgPrp4 and identified S289 as the phosphorylation site that is essential for its functions. These results indicated that FgPrp4 is critical for splicing efficiency but not essential for intron splicing, and FgPrp4 may regulate pre-mRNA splicing by phosphorylation of other components of the tri-snRNP although itself may be activated by phosphorylation at S289."

"27194419","abstracttext","Transcription factors (TFs) play critical roles in mediating defense of plants to abiotic stresses through regulating downstream defensive genes. In this study, a wheat C2H2-ZFP (zinc finger protein) type TF gene designated as TaZAT8 was functionally characterized in mediating tolerance to the inorganic phosphate (Pi)-starvation stress. TaZAT8 bears conserved motifs harboring in the C2H2-ZFP type counterparts across vascular plant species. The expression of TaZAT8 was shown to be induced in roots upon Pi deprivation, with a Pi concentration- and temporal-dependent manner. Overexpression of TaZAT8 in tobacco conferred plants improved tolerance to Pi deprivation; the transgenic lines exhibited enlarged phenotype and elevated biomass and phosphorus (P) accumulation relative to wild-type (WT) after Pi-starvation treatment. NtPT1 and NtPT2, the tobacco phosphate transporter (PT) genes, showed increased transcripts in the Pi-deprived transgenic lines, indicative of their transcriptional regulation by TaZAT8. Overexpression analysis of these PT genes validated their function in mediating Pi acquisition under the Pi deprivation conditions. Additionally, the TaZAT8-overexpressing lines also behaved enhanced antioxidant enzyme (AE) activities and enlarged root system architecture (RSA) with respect to WT. Evaluation of the transcript abundance of tobacco genes encoding AE and PIN proteins, including NtMnSOD1, NtSOD1, NtPOD1;2, NtPOD1;5, NtPOD1;6, and NtPOD1;9, and NtPIN1 and NtPIN4 are upregulated in the TaZAT8-overexpressing lines. Overexpression of NtPIN1 and NtPIN4 conferred plants to enlarged RSA and elevated biomass under the Pi-starvation stress conditions. Our investigation provides insights into plant adaptation to the Pi-starvation stress mediated by distinct ZFP TFs through modulation of Pi acquisition and cellular ROS detoxicity."

"26996463","abstracttext_unlabelled","Sweetpotato has long been acknowledged as a significant contributor of global caloric needs, which continues to be of remarkable economic value. It is an important staple and emergency food in many countries and its annual world production hovers to about 130 million tons. The tubers act as sink and compete for the available photoassimilates eventually leading to the acquisition of nutrients and phytochemicals. Differential display of genes or gene-products, and metabolites causes differences in nutritive value of closely related ecotypes. To better understand the molecular basis for differential nutrient availability and phytochemicals, and exploit the natural genetic variation(s), we aimed at developing proteometabolic profiles of two contrasting ecotypes of sweetpotato. Proteomic analyses led to the identification of 1541 and 1201 proteins in orange fleshed and white fleshed sweetpotato ecotypes, respectively, presumably associated with binding, followed by catalytic, transferase, hydrolase, kinase and transporter activities. Furthermore, metabolome profiling revealed 148 and 126 metabolites in cv. OFSP and WFSP, respectively. This study would provide a basis for future comparative proteometabolomic efforts for sweetpotato, in particular and tuber crops in general. The results would expand our understanding of the proteome as well as metabolome and give new insights into how ecotype-specific traits are developed."
"26996463","abstracttext_biological significance","Sweetpotato, the potato of the tropics, is the seventh most important crop worldwide in terms of production for food and additional industrial resources. Over 95% of the global sweet potato is produced in developing countries where it is considered as emergency food. It is also a vegetable, a snack food and confectionery item in most countries. It greatly contributes as a phytochemical source of nutrition and can produce more edible energy per hectare per day than wheat or rice. The adaptability to a wide range of agroecological conditions with least growth requirements makes it a preferred tuber crop of high commercial significance. Despite its nutritional merits, it has always remained outside the realm of large-scale functional genomics. Therefore, this study was aimed at constructing the proteomics and metabolomics shared resource for sweetpotato. These data are particularly significant, at least partially due to the fact that the currently available information about sweet potato is under-represented."

"27446180","abstracttext","Water is a critical environmental factor that restricts the geographic distribution of plants. Sheepgrass [Leymus chinensis, (Trin.) Tzvel] is an important forage grass in the Eurasia Steppe and a close germplasm for wheat and barley. This native grass adapts well to adverse environments such as cold, salinity, alkalinity and drought, and it can survive when the soil moisture may be less than 6% in dry seasons. However, little is known about how sheepgrass tolerates water stress at the molecular level. Here, drought stress experiment and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed in three pools of RNA samples (control, drought stress, and rewatering). We found that sheepgrass seedlings could still survive when the soil water content (SWC) was reduced to 14.09%. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis showed that 7320 genes exhibited significant responses to drought stress. Of these DEGs, 2671 presented opposite expression trends before and after rewatering. Furthermore, ~680 putative sheepgrass-specific water responsive genes were revealed that can be studied deeply. Gene ontology (GO) annotation revealed that stress-associated genes were activated extensively by drought treatment. Interestingly, cold stress-related genes were up-regulated greatly after drought stress. The DEGs of MAPK and calcium signal pathways, plant hormone ABA, jasmonate, ethylene, brassinosteroid signal pathways, cold response CBF pathway participated coordinatively in sheepgrass drought stress response. In addition, we identified 288 putative transcription factors (TFs) involved in drought response, among them, the WRKY, NAC, AP2/ERF, bHLH, bZIP, and MYB families were enriched, and might play crucial and significant roles in drought stress response of sheepgrass. Our research provided new and valuable information for understanding the mechanism of drought tolerance in sheepgrass. Moreover, the identification of genes involved in drought response can facilitate the genetic improvement of crops by molecular breeding."

"27262159","abstracttext","The TNM-system fails to accurately predict disease recurrence in a considerate number of patients. While node-negative (stage II) colon cancer is considered to have an overall good prognosis, the 5-year cancer-specific survival is reported at 81-83% in patients who did not have adjuvant chemotherapy. Thus, reliance on node-status alone has lead to under-treatment in a subgroup of stage II patients with an unfavorable prognosis. The search for new and better prognosticators in stage II colon cancer has suggested several proposed biomarkers of better prognostication and prediction. However, few such biomarkers have reached widespread clinical utility. For the clinician swimming in the sea of emerging biomarkers, it may be hard to recognize the true floating aid from the surrounding debris in the search for more precise decision-making. Proposed markers include microsatellite instability (MSI), KRAS mutations and BRAF mutations, but a number of gene panels and consensus molecular subtypes are proposed for clinical prediction and prognostication as well. While several studies suggest such biomarkers or panels to have a prognostic role in subgroups of patients, a number of studies are reported in heterogeneous groups with in part discordant findings, which again distorts the predictive and prognostic ability of each marker. Lack of homogeneous cohorts, underpowered studies in strict subgroups and challenges in analytical and clinical validity may hamper the progress towards widespread clinical utility. The harvest of prognostic biomarkers in colon cancer has yielded a huge number of candidates for which it is now time to separate the wheat from the chaff."

"27150814","abstracttext","Gaining new knowledge through fungal monoculture responses to lignocellulose is a widely used approach that can lead to better cocktails for lignocellulose saccharification (the enzymatic release of sugars which are subsequently used to make biofuels). However, responses in lignocellulose mixed cultures are rarely studied in the same detail even though in nature fungi often degrade lignocellulose as mixed communities. Using a dual RNA-seq approach, we describe the first study of the transcriptional responses of wild-type strains of Aspergillus niger, Trichoderma reesei and Penicillium chrysogenum in two and three mixed species shake-flask cultures with wheat straw. Based on quantification of species-specific rRNA, a set of conditions was identified where mixed cultures could be sampled so as to obtain sufficient RNA-seq reads for analysis from each species. The number of differentially-expressed genes varied from a couple of thousand to fewer than one hundred. The proportion of carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZy) encoding transcripts was lower in the majority of the mixed cultures compared to the respective straw monocultures. A small subset of P. chrysogenum CAZy genes showed five to ten-fold significantly increased transcript abundance in a two-species mixed culture with T. reesei. However, a substantial number of T. reesei CAZy transcripts showed reduced abundance in mixed cultures. The highly induced genes in mixed cultures indicated that fungal antagonism was a major part of the mixed cultures. In line with this, secondary metabolite producing gene clusters showed increased transcript abundance in mixed cultures and also mixed cultures with T. reesei led to a decrease in the mycelial biomass of A. niger. Significantly higher monomeric sugar release from straw was only measured using a minority of the mixed culture filtrates and there was no overall improvement. This study demonstrates fungal interaction with changes in transcripts, enzyme activities and biomass in the mixed cultures and whilst there were minor beneficial effects for CAZy transcripts and activities, the competitive interaction between T. reesei and the other fungi was the most prominent feature of this study."
"28974947","articletitle","Fungal Lactamases: Their Occurrence and Function."
"28974947","abstracttext","Fungi are absorptive feeders and thus must colonize and ramify through their substrate to survive. In so doing they are in competition, particularly in the soil, with myriad microbes. These microbes use xenobiotic compounds as offensive weapons to compete for nutrition, and fungi must be sufficiently resistant to these xenobiotics. One prominent mechanism of xenobiotic resistance is through production of corresponding degrading enzymes. As typical examples, bacterial β-lactamases are well known for their ability to degrade and consequently confer resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, a serious emerging problem in health care. We have identified many fungal genes that putatively encode proteins exhibiting a high degree of similarity to β-lactamases. However, fungal cell walls are structurally different from the bacterial peptidoglycan target of β-lactams. This raises the question, why do fungi have lactamases and what are their functions? Previously, we identified and characterized one Fusarium verticillioides lactamase encoding gene (FVEG_08291) that confers resistance to the benzoxazinoid phytoanticipins produced by maize, wheat, and rye. Since benzoxazinoids are γ-lactams with five-membered rings rather than the four-membered β-lactams, we refer to the predicted enzymes simply as lactamases, rather than β-lactamases. An overview of fungal genomes suggests a strong positive correlation between environmental niche complexity and the number of fungal lactamase encoding genes, with soil-borne fungi showing dramatic amplification of lactamase encoding genes compared to those fungi found in less biologically complex environments. Remarkably, Fusarium species frequently possess large (>40) numbers of these genes. We hypothesize that many fungal hydrolytic lactamases are responsible for the degradation of plant or microbial xenobiotic lactam compounds. Alignment of protein sequences revealed two conserved patterns resembling bacterial β-lactamases, specifically those possessing PFAM domains PF00753 or PF00144. Structural predictions of F. verticillioides lactamases also suggested similar catalytic mechanisms to those of their bacterial counterparts. Overall, we present the first in-depth analysis of lactamases in fungi, and discuss their potential relevance to fitness and resistance to antimicrobials in the environment."

"28875871","abstracttext","Obesity is strongly associated with insulin resistance (IR), along with mitochondrial dysfunction to metabolically active tissues and increased production of reactive O2 species (ROS). Foods rich in antioxidants such as wheat germ (WG), protect tissues from damage due to ROS and modulate some negative effects of obesity. This study examined the effects of WG supplementation on markers of IR, mitochondrial substrate metabolism and innate antioxidant markers in two metabolically active tissues (i.e. liver and heart) of C57BL/6 mice fed a high-fat-high-sucrose (HFS) diet. Male C57BL/6 mice, 6-week-old, were randomised into four dietary treatment groups (n 12 mice/group): control (C, 10 % fat kcal), C+10 % WG, HFS (60 % fat kcal) or HFS+10 % WG (HFS+WG). After 12 weeks of treatment, HFS+WG mice had significantly less visceral fat (-16 %, P=0·006) compared with the HFS group. WG significantly reduced serum insulin (P=0·009), the insulinotropic hormone, gastric inhibitory peptide (P=0·0003), and the surrogate measure of IR, homoeostatic model assessment of IR (P=0·006). HFS diet significantly elevated (45 %, P=0·02) cardiac complex 2 mitochondrial VO2, suggesting increased metabolic stress, whereas WG stabilised this effect to the level of control. Consequently, genes which mediate antioxidant defense and mitochondrial biogenesis (superoxide dismutase 2 (Sod2) and PPARγ coactivator 1-α (Pgc1a), respectively) were significantly reduced (P<0·05) in the heart of the HFS group, whereas WG supplementation tended to up-regulate both genes. WG significantly increased hepatic gene expression of Sod2 (P=0·048) but not Pgc1a. Together, these results showed that WG supplementation in HFS diet, reduced IR and improved cardiac mitochondrial metabolic functions."

In this study, a Malaysian salt-tolerant indigenous rice variety named Bajong and one commercial rice variety named MR219 were investigated for their performance in plant growth and ion accumulation properties after salt stress treatment. Bajong was further investigated for the changes in leaf's transcriptome after 6 h of stress treatment using 100 mM NaCl. Based on the results obtained, Bajong is found to be significantly more salt tolerant than MR219, showing better growth and a lower sodium ion accumulation after the stress treatment. Additionally, Bajong was analysed by transcriptomic sequencing, generating a total of 130 millions reads. The reads were assembled into de novo transcriptome and each transcript was annotated using several pre-existing databases. The transcriptomes of control and salt-stressed samples were then compared, leading to the discovery of 4096 DEGs. Based on the functional annotation results obtained, the enrichment factor of each functional group in DEGs was calculated in relation to the total reads obtained. It was found that the group with the highest gene modulation was involved in the secondary metabolite biosynthesis of plants, with approximately 2.5% increase in relation to the total reads obtained. This suggests an extensive transcriptional reprogramming of the secondary metabolic pathways after stress induction, which could be directly responsible for the salt tolerance capability of Bajong."

"29214328","abstracttext_key message","5-azaC treatment and TaPBF - D over-expression decrease C-methylation status of three Glu - 1 gene promoters, and aid in enhancing the expression of the Glu - 1 genes. The wheat glutenins exert a strong influence over dough elasticity, but the regulation of their encoding genes has not been firmly established. Following treatment with 5-azacytidine (5-azaC), both the weight and glutenin content of the developing and mature grains were significantly increased. The abundance of transcript produced by the Glu-1 genes (encoding high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits), as well as those encoding demethylases and transcriptional factors associated with prolamin synthesis was higher than in grain of non-treated plants. These grains also contained an enhanced content of the prolamin box binding factor (PBF) protein. Bisulfite sequencing indicated that the Glu-1 promoters were less strongly C-methylated in the developing grain than in the flag leaf, while in the developing grain of 5-azaC treated plants, the C-methylation level was lower than in equivalent grains of non-treated plants. Both Glu-1 transcript abundance and glutenin content were higher in the grain set by three independent over-expressors of the D genome homoeolog of TaPBF than in the grain set by wild type plants. When assessed 10 days after flowering, the Glu-1 promoters' methylation level was lower in the developing grains set by the TaPBF-D over-expressor than in the wild type control. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that PBF-D was able to bind in vitro to the P-box of Glu-1By8 and -1Dx2, while a ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed that a lower level of C-methylation in the Glu-1By8 and -1Dx2 promoters improved the TaPBF binding. We suggest that promoter DNA C-methylation is a key determinant of Glu-1 transcription."

"29143601","abstracttext_background","Sand rice (Agriophyllum squarrosum (L.) Moq.) is an annual shrub-like plant adapted to the mobile sand dunes in desert and semi-desert regions of Asia. It has a balanced nutrient composition with relatively high concentration of lipids and proteins, which results in its nutrition being similar to legumes. Sand rice's proteins contain the full range of essential amino acids. However, calories content is more similar to wheat. These features together with desert stress resistance make sand rice a potential food crop resilient to ongoing climate change. It is also an important fodder crop (on young stages of growth) for cattle in arid regions of Kazakhstan. In our work, sand rice samples were collected from two distant regions of Kazakhstan as a part of the nation-wide project to determine genetic variation of the native flora."
"29143601","abstracttext_results","Samples were collected in western and southeastern parts of Kazakhstan separated by distances of up to 1300 km. Sequences of the nuclear ribosomal DNA ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region and the chloroplast matK gene confirmed the identity of species defined by morphological traits. Comparison with GenBank sequences revealed polymorphic sequence positions among Kazakh populations and GenBank references, and suggested a distinction among local populations of sand rice. The phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences showed a clear partition of A. squarrosum (L.) Moq. from Agriophyllum minus Fisch. & C.A. Mey, which grows in the same sand dunes environment."
"29143601","abstracttext_conclusions","DNA barcoding analyses of ITS and matK sequences showed a segregation of A. squarrosum from A. minus into separate clades in Maximum-Likelhood dendrograms. ITS analysis can be successfully used to characterize A. squarrosum populations growing quite distant from each other. The data obtained in this work provide the basis for further investigations on A. squarrosum population structure and may play a role in the screening of sand rice plants growing in desert and semi-desert environments of Central Asia and China."

"29149221","abstracttext","Dietary protein sources can have profound effects on host-microbe interactions in the gut that are critically important for immune resilience. However more knowledge is needed to assess the impact of different protein sources on gut and animal health. Thirty-six wildtype male C57BL/6J mice of 35 d age (n = 6/group; mean ± SEM body weight 21.9 ± 0.25 g) were randomly assigned to groups fed for four weeks with semi synthetic diets prepared with one of the following protein sources containing (300 g/kg as fed basis): soybean meal (SBM), casein, partially delactosed whey powder, spray dried plasma protein, wheat gluten meal and yellow meal worm. At the end of the experiment, mice were sacrificed to collect ileal tissue to acquire gene expression data, and mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, ileal digesta to study changes in microbiota and serum to measure cytokines and chemokines. By genome-wide transcriptome analysis, we identified fourteen high level regulatory genes that are strongly affected in SBM-fed mice compared to the other experimental groups. They mostly related to the mTOR pathway. In addition, an increased (P < 0.05) concentration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was observed in serum of SBM-fed mice compared to other dietary groups. Moreover, by 16S rRNA sequencing, we observed that SBM-fed mice had higher (P < 0.05) abundances of Bacteroidales family S24-7, compared to the other dietary groups. We showed that measurements of genome-wide expression and microbiota composition in the mouse ileum reveal divergent responses to diets containing different protein sources, in particular for a diet based on SBM."

"28658302","abstracttext","Effective regulation of primary carbon metabolism is critically important for bacteria to successfully adapt to different environments. We have identified an uncharacterised transcriptional regulator; RccR, that controls this process in response to carbon source availability. Disruption of rccR in the plant-associated microbe Pseudomonas fluorescens inhibits growth in defined media, and compromises its ability to colonise the wheat rhizosphere. Structurally, RccR is almost identical to the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway regulator HexR, and both proteins are controlled by the same ED-intermediate; 2-keto-3-deoxy-6-phosphogluconate (KDPG). Despite these similarities, HexR and RccR control entirely different aspects of primary metabolism, with RccR regulating pyruvate metabolism (aceEF), the glyoxylate shunt (aceA, glcB, pntAA) and gluconeogenesis (pckA, gap). RccR displays complex and unusual regulatory behaviour; switching repression between the pyruvate metabolism and glyoxylate shunt/gluconeogenesis loci depending on the available carbon source. This regulatory complexity is enabled by two distinct pseudo-palindromic binding sites, differing only in the length of their linker regions, with KDPG binding increasing affinity for the 28 bp aceA binding site but decreasing affinity for the 15 bp aceE site. Thus, RccR is able to simultaneously suppress and activate gene expression in response to carbon source availability. Together, the RccR and HexR regulators enable the rapid coordination of multiple aspects of primary carbon metabolism, in response to levels of a single key intermediate."
"28659961","articletitle","Bulked Segregant RNA-seq Reveals Differential Expression and SNPs of Candidate Genes Associated with Waterlogging Tolerance in Maize."
"28659961","abstracttext","Waterlogging has increasingly become one of the major constraints to maize productivity in some maize production zones because it causes serious yield loss. Bulked segregant RNA-seq (BSR-seq) has been widely applied to profile candidate genes and map associated Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) markers in many species. In this study, 10 waterlogging sensitive and eight tolerant inbred lines were selected from 60 maize inbred lines with waterlogging response determined and preselected by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) from over 400 tropical maize inbred lines. BSR-seq was performed to identify differentially expressed genes and SNPs associated with waterlogging tolerance. Upon waterlogging stress, 354 and 1094 genes were differentially expressed in the tolerant and sensitive pools, respectively, compared to untreated controls. When tolerant and sensitive pools were compared, 593 genes were differentially expressed under untreated and 431 genes under waterlogged conditions, of which 122 genes overlapped. To validate the BSR-seq results, the expression levels of six genes were determined by qRT-PCR. The qRT-PCR results were consistent with BSR-seq results. Comparison of allelic polymorphism in mRNA sequences between tolerant and sensitive pools revealed 165 (normal condition) and 128 (waterlogged condition) high-probability SNPs. We found 18 overlapping SNPs with genomic positions mapped. Eighteen SNPs were contained in 18 genes, and eight and nine of 18 genes were responsive to waterlogging stress in tolerant and sensitive lines, respectively. Six alleles of the 18 originated from tolerant pool were significantly up-regulated under waterlogging, but not those from sensitive pool. Importantly, one allele ( GRMZM2G055704 ) of the six genes was mapped between umc1619 and umc1948 on chromosome 1 where a QTL associated with waterlogging tolerance was identified in a previous research, strongly indicating that GRMZM2G055704 is a candidate gene responsive to waterlogging. Our research contributes to the knowledge of the molecular mechanism for waterlogging tolerance in maize."

"28700638","abstracttext","Cyst nematodes are globally important pathogens in agriculture. Their sedentary lifestyle and long-term association with the roots of host plants render cyst nematodes especially good targets for attack by parasitic fungi. In this context fungi were specifically isolated from nematode eggs of the cereal cyst nematode Heterodera filipjevi. Here, Ijuhya vitellina (Ascomycota, Hypocreales, Bionectriaceae), encountered in wheat fields in Turkey, is newly described on the basis of phylogenetic analyses, morphological characters and life-style related inferences. The species destructively parasitises eggs inside cysts of H. filipjevi. The parasitism was reproduced in in vitro studies. Infected eggs were found to harbour microsclerotia produced by I. vitellina that resemble long-term survival structures also known from other ascomycetes. Microsclerotia were also formed by this species in pure cultures obtained from both, solitarily isolated infected eggs obtained from fields and artificially infected eggs. Hyphae penetrating the eggshell colonised the interior of eggs and became transformed into multicellular, chlamydospore-like structures that developed into microsclerotia. When isolated on artificial media, microsclerotia germinated to produce multiple emerging hyphae. The specific nature of morphological structures produced by I. vitellina inside nematode eggs is interpreted as a unique mode of interaction allowing long-term survival of the fungus inside nematode cysts that are known to survive periods of drought or other harsh environmental conditions. Generic classification of the new species is based on molecular phylogenetic inferences using five different gene regions. I. vitellina is the only species of the genus known to parasitise nematodes and produce microsclerotia. Metabolomic analyses revealed that within the Ijuhya species studied here, only I. vitellina produces chaetoglobosin A and its derivate 19-O-acetylchaetoglobosin A. Nematicidal and nematode-inhibiting activities of these compounds have been demonstrated suggesting that the production of these compounds may represent an adaptation to nematode parasitism."
"28771585","articletitle","A Genome Wide Association Study of arabinoxylan content in 2-row spring barley grain."
"28771585","abstracttext","In barley endosperm arabinoxylan (AX) is the second most abundant cell wall polysaccharide and in wheat it is the most abundant polysaccharide in the starchy endosperm walls of the grain. AX is one of the main contributors to grain dietary fibre content providing several health benefits including cholesterol and glucose lowering effects, and antioxidant activities. Due to its complex structural features, AX might also affect the downstream applications of barley grain in malting and brewing. Using a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) method we quantified AX amounts in mature grain in 128 spring 2-row barley accessions. Amounts ranged from ~ 5.2 μg/g to ~ 9 μg/g. We used this data for a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS) that revealed three significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with grain AX levels which passed a false discovery threshold (FDR) and are located on two of the seven barley chromosomes. Regions underlying the QTLs were scanned for genes likely to be involved in AX biosynthesis or turnover, and strong candidates, including glycosyltransferases from the GT43 and GT61 families and glycoside hydrolases from the GH10 family, were identified. Phylogenetic trees of selected gene families were built based on protein translations and were used to examine the relationship of the barley candidate genes to those in other species. Our data reaffirms the roles of existing genes thought to contribute to AX content, and identifies novel QTL (and candidate genes associated with them) potentially influencing the AX content of barley grain. One potential outcome of this work is the deployment of highly associated single nucleotide polymorphisms markers in breeding programs to guide the modification of AX abundance in barley grain."
"28442716","articletitle","A Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici secreted protein activates plant immunity at the cell surface."
"28442716","abstracttext","Pathogens secrete effector proteins to suppress host immunity, mediate nutrient uptake and subsequently enable parasitism. However, on non-adapted hosts, effectors can be detected as non-self by host immune receptors and activate non-host immunity. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms of effector triggered non-host resistance remain unknown. Here, we report that a small cysteine-rich protein PstSCR1 from the wheat rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) activates immunity in the non-host solanaceous model plant Nicotiana benthamiana. PstSCR1 homologs were found to be conserved in Pst, and in its closest relatives, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and Puccinia triticina. When PstSCR1 was expressed in N. benthamiana with its signal peptide, it provoked the plant immune system, whereas no stimulation was observed when it was expressed without its signal peptide. PstSCR1 expression in N. benthamiana significantly reduced infection capacity of the oomycete pathogens. Moreover, apoplast-targeted PstSCR1 triggered plant cell death in a dose dependent manner. However, in Brassinosteroid insensitive 1-Associated Kinase 1 (SERK3/BAK1) silenced N. benthamiana, cell death was remarkably decreased. Finally, purified PstSCR1 protein activated defence related gene expression in N. benthamiana. Our results show that a Pst-secreted protein, PstSCR1 can activate surface mediated immunity in non-adapted hosts and contribute to non-host resistance."

"28588643","abstracttext_results","Here, eight glycosyl hydrolase family candidate genes were selected from metagenomes of wheat straw-degrading microbial consortia using molecular cloning and subsequent gene expression studies in Escherichia coli. Four of the eight enzymes had significant activities on either p NP-β-d-galactopyranoside, p NP-β-d-xylopyranoside, p NP-α-l-arabinopyranoside or p NP-α-d-glucopyranoside. These proteins, denoted as proteins 1, 2, 5 and 6, were his-tag purified and their nature and activities further characterized using molecular and activity screens with the p NP-labeled substrates. Proteins 1 and 2 showed high homologies with (1) a β-galactosidase (74%) and (2) a β-xylosidase (84%), whereas the remaining two (5 and 6) were homologous with proteins reported as a diguanylate cyclase and an aquaporin, respectively. The β-galactosidase- and β-xylosidase-like proteins 1 and 2 were confirmed as being responsible for previously found thermo-alkaliphilic glycosidase activities of extracts of E. coli carrying the respective source fosmids. Remarkably, the β-xylosidase-like protein 2 showed activities with both p NP-Xyl and p NP-Ara in the temperature range 40-50 °C and pH range 8.0-10.0. Moreover, proteins 5 and 6 showed thermotolerant α-glucosidase activity at pH 10.0. In silico structure prediction of protein 5 revealed the presence of a potential ""GGDEF"" catalytic site, encoding α-glucosidase activity, whereas that of protein 6 showed a ""GDSL"" site, encoding a 'new family' α-glucosidase activity."

"28602911","abstracttext","Jaburetox is a recombinant peptide derived from a Canavalia ensiformis urease that presents toxic effects upon several species of insects, phytopathogenic fungi and yeasts of medical importance. So far, no toxicity of Jaburetox to mammals has been shown. Previous reports have identified biochemical targets of this toxic peptide in insect models, although its mechanism of action is not completely understood. In this work, we aimed to characterize the effects of Jaburetox in hemolymphatic insect cells. For this purpose, the model insect and Chagas' disease vector Rhodnius prolixus was used. In vivo and in vitro experiments indicated that Jaburetox interacts with a subset of hemocytes and it can be found in various subcellular compartments. In insects injected with Jaburetox there was an increase in the gene expression of the enzymes UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (UAP), chitin synthase and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Nevertheless, the expression of NOS protein, the enzyme activities of UAP and acid phosphatase (a possible link between UAP and NOS) as well as the phosphorylation state of proteins remained unchanged upon the in vivo Jaburetox treatment. Nitric oxide (NO) imaging using fluorescent probes showed that Jaburetox augmented NO production in the hemocyte aggregates when compared to controls. Even though Jaburetox activated the hemocytes, as demonstrated by wheat germ agglutinin binding assays, the peptide did not lead to an increase of their phagocytic behavior. Taken together, these findings contribute to our understanding of toxic effects of Jaburetox, a peptide with biotechnological applications and a prospective tool for rational insect control."

"28429296","abstracttext_results","Gene expression and metabolite analyses were used to characterise diurnal changes occurring during the Fe deficiency response of rice. Iron deficiency inducible genes involved in root DMA biosynthesis and secretion followed a diurnal pattern with peak induction occurring 3-5 h after the onset of light; a result consistent with that of other Strategy II plant species such as barley and wheat. Furthermore, triple quadrupole mass spectrometry identified 3-5 h after the onset of light as peak time of DMA secretion from Fe-deficient rice roots. Metabolite profiling identified accumulation of amines associated with metal chelation, metal translocation and plant oxidative stress responses occurring with peak induction 10-12 h after the onset of light."

This study complements previous studies on the genetic changes in response to Fe deficiency in rice and constitutes an important advance towards our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the rice Fe deficiency response."

"27790066","abstracttext","The most economically important species used in a wide range of fermentation industries throughout Asia belong to Aspergillus section Flavi , which are morphologically and phylogenetically indistinguishable, with a few being toxigenic and therefore a major concern. They are frequently isolated from Korean fermentation starters, such as nuruk and meju . The growing popularity of traditional Korean alcoholic beverages has led to a demand for their quality enhancement, therefore requiring selection of efficient non-toxigenic strains to assist effective fermentation. This study was performed to classify the most efficient strains of Aspergillus section Flavi isolated from various types of traditional wheat nuruk , based on a polyphasic approach involving molecular and biochemical evaluation. A total of 69 strains were isolated based on colony morphology and identified as Aspergillus oryzae / flavus based on internal transcribed spacer and calmodulin gene sequencing. Interestingly, none were toxigenic based on PCR amplification of intergenic regions of the aflatoxin cluster genes norB - cypA and the absence of aflatoxin in the culture supernatants by thin-layer chromatography analysis. Saccharification capability of the isolates, assessed through α-amylase and glucoamylase activities, revealed that two isolates, TNA24 and TNA15, showed the highest levels of activity. Although the degrees of variation in α-amylase and glucoamylase activities among the isolates were higher, there were only slight differences in acid protease activity among the isolates with two, TNA28 and TNA36, showing the highest activities. Furthermore, statistical analyses showed that α-amylase activity was positively correlated with glucoamylase activity ( p < 0.001), and therefore screening for either was sufficient to predict the saccharifying capacity of the Aspergillus strain."
"27792769","articletitle","Use of Combined MSAP and NGS Techniques to Identify Differentially Methylated Regions in Somaclones: A Case Study of Two Stable Somatic Wheat Mutants."
"27792769","abstracttext","The appearance of somaclonal variability induced by in vitro cultivation is relatively frequent and can, in some cases, provide a valuable source of new genetic variation for crop improvement. The cause of this phenomenon remains unknown; however, there are a number of reports suggesting that epigenetics, including DNA methylations, are an important factor. In addition to the non-heritable DNA methylation changes caused by transient and reversible stress-responsive gene regulation, recent evidence supports the existence of mitotically and meiotically inherited changes. The induction of phenotypes via stable DNA methylation changes has occasionally great economical value; however, very little is known about the genetic or molecular basis of these phenotypes. We used a novel approach consisting of a standard MSAP analysis followed by deep amplicon sequencing to better understand this phenomenon. Our models included two wheat genotypes, and their somaclones induced using in vitro cultivation with a changed heritable phenotype (shortened stem height and silenced high molecular weight glutenin). Using this novel procedure, we obtained information on the dissimilarity of DNA methylation landscapes between the standard cultivar and its respective somaclones, and we extracted the sequences and genome regions that were differentially methylated between subjects. Transposable elements were identified as the most likely factor for producing changes in somaclone properties. In summary, the novel approach of combining MSAP and NGS is relatively easy and widely applicable, which is a rather unique feature compared with the currently available techniques in the epigenetics field."

In this study, stool samples representing the gut microbiomes from 6 gluten-sensitive (GS) captive juvenile rhesus macaques were compared with those from 6 healthy, age- and diet-matched peers. A total of 48 samples representing both groups were studied using V4 16S rRNA gene DNA analysis. Samples from GS macaques were further characterized based on type of diet administered: conventional monkey chow, i.e., wheat gluten-containing diet (GD), gluten-free diet (GFD), barley gluten-derived diet (BOMI) and reduced gluten barley-derived diet (RGB). It was hypothesized that the GD diet would lower the gut microbial diversity in GS macaques. This is the first report illustrating the reduction of gut microbial alpha-diversity ( p < 0.05) following the consumption of dietary gluten in GS macaques. Selected bacterial families (e.g., Streptococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae ) were enriched in GS macaques while Coriobacteriaceae was enriched in healthy animals. Within several weeks after the replacement of the GD by the GFD diet, the composition (beta-diversity) of gut microbiome in GS macaques started to change ( p = 0.011) towards that of a normal macaque. Significance for alpha-diversity however, was not reached by the day 70 when the feeding experiment ended. Several inflammation-associated microRNAs (miR-203, -204, -23a, -23b and -29b) were upregulated ( p < 0.05) in jejunum of 4 biopsied GS macaques fed GD with predicted binding sites on 16S ribosomal RNA of Lactobacillus reuteri (accession number: NR_025911), Prevotella stercorea (NR_041364) and Streptococcus luteciae (AJ297218) that were overrepresented in feces. Additionally, claudin-1, a validated tight junction protein target of miR-29b was significantly downregulated in jejunal epithelium of GS macaques. Taken together, we predict that with the introduction of effective treatments in future studies the diversity of gut microbiomes in GS macaques will approach those of healthy individuals.

"27812362","abstracttext","Oxidative stress in plants can be triggered by many environmental stress factors, such as drought and salinity. Brachypodium distachyon is a model organism for the study of biofuel plants and crops, such as wheat. Although recent studies have found many oxidative stress response-related proteins, the mechanism of microRNA (miRNA)-mediated oxidative stress response is still unclear. Using next generation high-throughput sequencing technology, the small RNAs were sequenced from the model plant B. distachyon 21 (Bd21) under H 2 O 2 stress and normal growth conditions. In total, 144 known B. distachyon miRNAs and 221 potential new miRNAs were identified. Further analysis of potential new miRNAs suggested that 36 could be clustered into known miRNA families, while the remaining 185 were identified as B. distachyon -specific new miRNAs. Differential analysis of miRNAs from the normal and H 2 O 2 stress libraries identified 31 known and 30 new H 2 O 2 stress responsive miRNAs. The expression patterns of seven representative miRNAs were verified by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis, which produced results consistent with those of the deep sequencing method. Moreover, we also performed RT-qPCR analysis to verify the expression levels of 13 target genes and the cleavage site of 5 target genes by known or novel miRNAs were validated experimentally by 5' RACE. Additionally, a miRNA-mediated gene regulatory network for H 2 O 2 stress response was constructed. Our study identifies a set of H 2 O 2 -responsive miRNAs and their target genes and reveals the mechanism of oxidative stress response and defense at the post-transcriptional regulatory level."

"27814391","abstracttext","Tilletia indica causes the disease Karnal bunt in wheat. The disease is under international quarantine regulations. Comparative mitochondrial (mt) genome analysis of T. indica (KX394364 and DQ993184) and T. walkeri (EF536375) has found 325 to 328 SNPs, 57 to 60 short InDels (from 1 to 13 nt), two InDels (30 and 61 nt) and five (>200 nt) presence/absence variations (PAVs) between the two species. The mt genomes of both species have identical gene order. The numbers of SNPs and InDels between the mt genomes of the two species are approximately nine times of the corresponding numbers between the two T. indica isolates. There are eight SNPs between T. indica and T. walkeri that resulted in amino acid substitutions in the mt genes of cob, nad2 and nad5. In contrast, there is no amino acid substitution in the mt genes of the T. indica isolates from the SNPs found. The five PAVs present in T. indica (DQ993184) are absent in T. walkeri. Four PAVs are more than 1 kb and are not present in every T. indica isolate. Analysis of their presence and absence separates a collection of T. indica isolates into 11 subgroups. Two PAVs have ORFs for the LAGLIDAG endonuclease and two have ORFs for the GIY-YIG endonuclease family, which are representatives of homing endonuclease genes (HEGs). These intron- encoded HEGs confer intron mobility and account for their fluid distribution in T. indica isolates. The small PAV of 221 bp, present in every T. indica isolate and unique to the species, was used as the genetic fingerprint for the successful development of a rapid, highly sensitive and specific loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay. The simple procedure of the LAMP assay and the easy detection formats will enable the assay to be automated for high throughput diagnosis."

"27846306","abstracttext","Association mapping was performed for 18 agromorphological and grain quality traits in a set of 183 Spanish landraces, including subspecies durum, turgidum and dicoccon, genotyped with 749 DArT (Diversity Array Technology) markers. Large genetic and phenotypic variability was detected, being the level of diversity among the chromosomes and genomes heterogeneous, and sometimes complementary, among subspecies. Overall, 356 were monomorphic in at least one subspecies, mainly in dicoccon, and some of them coincidental between subspecies, especially between turgidum and dicoccon. Several of those fixed markers were associated to plant responses to environmental stresses or linked to genes subjected to selection during tetraploid wheat domestication process. A total of 85 stable MTAs (marker-trait associations) have been identified for the agromorphological and quality parameters, some of them common among subspecies and others subspecies-specific. For all the traits, we have found MTAs explaining more than 10% of the phenotypic variation in any of the three subspecies. The number of MTAs on the B genome exceeded that on the A genome in subsp. durum, equalled in turgidum and was below in dicoccon. The validation of several adaptive and quality trait MTAs by combining the association mapping with an analysis of the signature of selection, identifying the putative gene function of the marker, or by coincidences with previous reports, showed that our approach was successful for the detection of MTAs and the high potential of the collection to identify marker-trait associations. Novel MTAs not previously reported, some of them subspecies specific, have been described and provide new information about the genetic control of complex traits."

Among these, eight isolates, GS-1, GS-3, GS-4, GS-6, GS-7, FS-2 (cactus), ARS-38 (cotton), and RP-4 (para grass), showed antifungal activity and were selected for detailed study. Based on biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequences, these were identified as strains of P. chlororaphis subsp. chlororaphis and aurantiaca . Secondary metabolites of these strains were analyzed by LC-MS. Phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), 2-hydroxy-phenazine, Cyclic Lipopeptide (white line-inducing principle (WLIP)), and lahorenoic acid A were detected in variable amounts in these strains. P. aurantiaca PB-St2 was used as a reference as it is known for the production of these compounds. The phzO and PCA genes were amplified to assure that production of these compounds is not an artifact. Indole acetic acid production was confirmed and quantified by HPLC. HCN and siderophore production by all strains was observed by plate assays. These strains did not solubilize phosphate, but five strains were positive for zinc solubilization. Wheat seedlings were inoculated with these strains to observe their effect on plant growth. P. aurantiaca strains PB-St2 and GS-6 and P. chlororaphis RP-4 significantly increased both root and shoot dry weights, as compared with uninoculated plants. However, P. aurantiaca strains FS-2 and ARS-38 significantly increased root and shoot dry weights, respectively. All strains except PB-St2 and ARS-38 significantly increased the root length.

"27866226","abstracttext_key message","Mid-parent values of Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance tested across several locations are a good predictor of hybrid performance caused by a preponderance of additive gene action in wheat. Hybrid breeding is intensively discussed as one solution to boost yield and yield stability including an enhanced biotic stress resistance. Our objectives were to investigate (1) the heterosis for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance, (2) the importance of general (GCA) vs. specific combining ability (SCA) for FHB resistance, and (3) the possibility to predict the FHB resistance of the hybrids by the parental means. We re-analyzed phenotypic data of a large population comprising 1604 hybrids and their 120 female and 15 male parental lines evaluated in inoculation trials across seven environments. Mid-parent heterosis of FHB severity averaged -9%, with a range from -36 to +35%. Mean better parent heterosis was 2% and 78 of the hybrids significantly (P < 0.05) outperformed the best commercial check variety included in our study. FHB resistance was not correlated with grain yield in healthy status for lines (r = 0.01) and hybrids (r = 0.09, P < 0.01). While a preponderance of GCA variance (P < 0.01) was found, SCA variance was not significantly different from zero. Accuracy to predict hybrid performance of FHB severity based on mid-parent values and on GCA effects was high (r = 0.70 and 0.86, respectively; P < 0.01). Similarly, line per se performance and GCA effects were significantly correlated (r = 0.77; P < 0.01). The substantial level of mid-parent heterosis in the desired direction of decreased susceptibility and the negligible better parent heterosis suggest that hybrids are an attractive alternative variety type to improve FHB resistance."

"28066495","abstracttext","Deficiencies of essential micronutrients such as iron and zinc are the cause of extensive health problems in developing countries. They adversely affect performance, productivity and are a major hindrance to economic development. Since many people who suffer from micronutrient deficiencies are dependent on staple crops to meet their dietary requirements, the development of crop cultivars with increased levels of micronutrients in their edible parts is becoming increasingly recognized as a sustainable solution. This is largely facilitated by genetics and genomic platforms. The cereal crop pearl millet ( Pennisetum glaucum ), is an excellent candidate for genetic improvement due to its ability to thrive in dry, semi-arid regions, where farming conditions are often unfavorable. Not only does pearl millet grow in areas where other crops such as maize and wheat do not survive, it contains naturally high levels of micronutrients, proteins and a myriad of other health benefitting characteristics. This review discusses the current status of iron and zinc deficiencies and reasons why interventions such as fortification, supplementation, and soil management are neither practicable nor affordable in poverty stricken areas. We argue that the most cost effective, sustainable intervention strategy is to biofortify pearl millet with enhanced levels of bioavailable iron and zinc. We discuss how naturally occurring genetic variations present in germplasm collections can be incorporated into elite, micronutrient rich varieties and what platforms are available to drive this research. We also consider the logistics of transgenic methods that could facilitate the improvement of the pearl millet gene pool."

Of the 5,000 estimated species, only three aphids have published whole genome sequences: the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. We present the whole genome sequence of a fourth aphid, the soybean aphid (Aphis glycines), which is an extreme specialist and an important invasive pest of soybean (Glycine max). The availability of genomic resources is important to establish effective and sustainable pest control, as well as to expand our understanding of aphid evolution. We generated a 302.9 Mbp draft genome assembly for Ap. glycines using a hybrid sequencing approach. This assembly shows high completeness with 19,182 predicted genes, 92% of known Ap. glycines transcripts mapping to contigs, and substantial continuity with a scaffold N 50 of 174,505 bp. The assembly represents 95.5% of the predicted genome size of 317.1 Mbp based on flow cytometry. Ap. glycines contains the smallest known aphid genome to date, based on updated genome sizes for 19 aphid species. The repetitive DNA content of the Ap. glycines genome assembly (81.6 Mbp or 26.94% of the 302.9 Mbp assembly) shows a reduction in the number of classified transposable elements compared to Ac. pisum, and likely contributes to the small estimated genome size. We include comparative analyses of gene families related to host-specificity (cytochrome P450's and effectors), which may be important in Ap. glycines evolution. This Ap. glycines draft genome sequence will provide a resource for the study of aphid genome evolution, their interaction with host plants, and candidate genes for novel insect control methods."

Genes coding for 45S ribosomal RNA are organized in tandem arrays of up to several thousand copies and contain codes for 18S, 5.8S and 26S rRNA units separated by internal transcribed spacers ITS1 and ITS2. While the rRNA units are evolutionary conserved, ITS regions show high level of interspecific divergence and have been used frequently in genetic diversity and phylogenetic studies. In this study, the genomic DNA was then amplified with PCR using primers specific for ITS gene. PCR products were then visualized on agarose gel."

"28005988","articletitle","HvDep1 Is a Positive Regulator of Culm Elongation and Grain Size in Barley and Impacts Yield in an Environment-Dependent Manner."
"28005988","abstracttext","Heterotrimeric G proteins are intracellular membrane-attached signal transducers involved in various cellular processes in both plants and animals. They consist of three subunits denoted as α, β and γ. The γ-subunits of the so-called AGG3 type, which comprise a transmembrane domain, are exclusively found in plants. In model species, these proteins have been shown to participate in the control of plant height, branching and seed size and could therefore impact the harvestable yield of various crop plants. Whether AGG3-type γ-subunits influence yield in temperate cereals like barley and wheat remains unknown. Using a transgenic complementation approach, we show here that the Scottish malting barley cultivar (cv.) Golden Promise carries a loss-of-function mutation in HvDep1, an AGG3-type subunit encoding gene that positively regulates culm elongation and seed size in barley. Somewhat intriguingly, agronomic field data collected over a 12-year period reveals that the HvDep1 loss-of-function mutation in cv. Golden Promise has the potential to confer either a significant increase or decrease in harvestable yield depending on the environment. Our results confirm the role of AGG3-type subunit-encoding genes in shaping plant architecture, but interestingly also indicate that the impact HvDep1 has on yield in barley is both genotypically and environmentally sensitive. This may explain why widespread exploitation of variation in AGG3-type subunit-encoding genes has not occurred in temperate cereals while in rice the DEP1 locus is widely exploited to improve harvestable yield."

"28039114","abstracttext","The potential social-economic and environmental impacts caused by transgene flow from genetically engineered (GE) crops have stimulated worldwide biosafety concerns. To determine transgene flow frequencies resulted from pollination is the first critical step for assessing such impacts, in addition to the determination of transgene expression and fitness in crop-wild hybrid descendants. Two methods are commonly used to estimate pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) frequencies: field experimenting and mathematical modeling. Field experiments can provide relatively accurate results but are time/resource consuming. Modeling offers an effective complement for PMGF experimental assessment. However, many published models describe PMGF by mathematical equations and are practically not easy to use. To increase the application of PMGF modeling for the estimation of transgene flow, we established a tool to calculate PMGF frequencies based on a quasi-mechanistic PMGF model for wind-pollination species. This tool includes a calculating program displayed by an easy-operating interface. PMGF frequencies of different plant species can be quickly calculated under different environmental conditions by including a number of biological and wind speed parameters that can be measured in the fields/laboratories or obtained from published data. The tool is freely available in the public domain (http://ecology.fudan.edu.cn/userfiles/cn/files/Tool_Manual.zip). Case studies including rice, wheat, and maize demonstrated similar results between the calculated frequencies based on this tool and those from published PMGF data. This PMGF calculating tool will provide useful information for assessing and monitoring social-economic and environmental impacts caused by transgene flow from GE crops. This tool can also be applied to determine the isolation distances between GE and non-GE crops in a coexistence agro-ecosystem, and to ensure the purity of certified seeds by setting proper isolation distances among field production plots."

The present study aimed to assess the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on inflammation and clinical features of migraine. Methods: This randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted among 45 non-menopausal women aged 18-50 years, diagnosed for episodic migraine according to the International Headache Society. After one month run-in period, subjects received CoQ10 (400 mg/day CoQ10, n = 23) or placebo (wheat starch, n = 22) for three months. All the patients got prophylactic medication too. Serum CoQ10 concentration, Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured at the beginning and end of the study. Results: CoQ10 supplementation reduced CGRP and TNF-α significantly ( p = 0.011 and p = 0.044, respectively), but there were no significant differences in serum IL-6 and IL-10 between the two groups. Significant increase in serum CoQ10 levels was evident with CoQ10 therapy ( P < 0.001). A significant improvement was found in frequency ( p = 0.018), severity ( p = 0.001) and duration ( p = 0.012) of migraine attacks in CoQ10 group compared to placebo. Conclusion: CoQ10 supplementation may decrease CGRP and TNF-α with no favorable effects on IL-6 and IL-10 in patients with migraine."

"29228925","abstracttext_background","Morphological divergences of snake retinal structure point to complex evolutionary processes and adaptations. The Colubridae family has a remarkable variety of retinal structure that can range from all-cone and all-rod to duplex (cone/rod) retinas. To explore whether nocturnal versus diurnal activity is responsible for constraints on molecular evolution and plays a role in visual opsin spectral tuning of colubrids, we carried out molecular evolution analyses of the visual opsin genes LWS, RH1, and SWS1 from 17 species and performed morphological analyses."
"29228925","abstracttext_results","Phylogenetic reconstructions of the RH1 and LWS recovered major clades characterized by primarily diurnal or primarily nocturnal activity patterns, in contrast with the topology for SWS1, which is very similar to the species tree. We found stronger signals of purifying selection along diurnal and nocturnal lineages for RH1 and SWS1, respectively. A blue-shift of the RH1 spectral peak is associated with diurnal habits. Spectral tuning of cone opsins did not differ among diurnal and nocturnal species. Retinas of nocturnal colubrids had many rows of photoreceptor nuclei, with large numbers of rods, labeled by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), and two types of cones: large cones sensitive to long/medium wavelengths (L/M) and small cones sensitive to ultra-violet/violet wavelengths (UV/VS). In contrast, retinas of diurnal species had only one row of photoreceptor nuclei, with four types of cones: large and double L/M cones, small UV/VS cones, and a second group of small cones, labeled by WGA."
"29228925","abstracttext_conclusions","For LWS gene, selection tests did not confirm different constraints related to activity pattern. For SWS1, stronger purifying selection in nocturnal lineages indicates divergent evolutionary pressures related to the activity pattern, and the importance of the short wavelength sensitivity at low light condition. Activity pattern has a clear influence on the signatures of selection and spectral tuning of RH1, with stronger purifying selection in diurnal lineages, which indicates selective pressure to preserve rhodopsin structure and function in pure-cone retinas. We suggest that the presence of four cone types in primarily diurnal colubrids might be related to the gain of color discrimination capacity."

According to our previous metatranscriptomic analysis, which identifies plenty of thermostable carbohydrate-active enzymes in NF liquor starter, the aim of this study is to provide a direct and efficient way to mine these thermostable enzymes."
"29471820","abstracttext_results","In present study, an alpha-amylase (NFAmy13A) gene, which showed the highest expression level of enzymes in starch degradation at high temperature stage (62 °C), was directly obtained by functional metatranscriptomics from Chinese Nong-flavor liquor starter and expressed in Pichia pastoris. NFAmy13A had a typical signal peptide and shared the highest sequence identity of 64% with α-amylase from Aspergillus niger. The recombinant enzyme of NFAmy13A showed an optimal pH at 5.0-5.5 and optimal temperature at 60 °C.

This work would stimulate mining more enzymes from NF liquor starter and studying their potentially synergistic roles in NF liquor brewing, thus paving the way toward the optimization of liquor production and improvement of liquor quality in future."
"29263029","articletitle","Fine-Scale Recombination Maps of Fungal Plant Pathogens Reveal Dynamic Recombination Landscapes and Intragenic Hotspots."
"29263029","abstracttext","Meiotic recombination is an important driver of evolution. Variability in the intensity of recombination across chromosomes can affect sequence composition, nucleotide variation, and rates of adaptation. In many organisms, recombination events are concentrated within short segments termed recombination hotspots. The variation in recombination rate and positions of recombination hotspot can be studied using population genomics data and statistical methods. In this study, we conducted population genomics analyses to address the evolution of recombination in two closely related fungal plant pathogens: the prominent wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and a sister species infecting wild grasses Z. ardabiliae We specifically addressed whether recombination landscapes, including hotspot positions, are conserved in the two recently diverged species and if recombination contributes to rapid evolution of pathogenicity traits. We conducted a detailed simulation analysis to assess the performance of methods of recombination rate estimation based on patterns of linkage disequilibrium, in particular in the context of high nucleotide diversity. Our analyses reveal overall high recombination rates, a lack of suppressed recombination in centromeres, and significantly lower recombination rates on chromosomes that are known to be accessory. The comparison of the recombination landscapes of the two species reveals a strong correlation of recombination rate at the megabase scale, but little correlation at smaller scales. The recombination landscapes in both pathogen species are dominated by frequent recombination hotspots across the genome including coding regions, suggesting a strong impact of recombination on gene evolution. A significant but small fraction of these hotspots colocalize between the two species, suggesting that hotspot dynamics contribute to the overall pattern of fast evolving recombination in these species."

"29293638","abstracttext","Traceability of processed food and feed products has been gaining importance due to the impact that those products can have on human/animal health and to the associated economic and legal concerns, often related to adulterations and frauds as it can be the case for meat and milk. Despite mandatory traceability requirements for the analysis of feed composition, few reliable and accurate methods are presently available to enforce the legislative frame and allow the authentication of animal feeds. In this study, nine sensitive and species-specific real-time PCR TaqMan MGB assays are described for plant species detection in animal feed samples. The method is based on selective real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR) amplification of target genes belonging to the alternative oxidase (AOX) gene family. The plant species selected for detection in feed samples were wheat, maize, barley, soybean, rice and sunflower as common components of feeds, and cotton, flax and peanut as possible undesirable contaminants. The obtained results were compared with end-point PCR methodology. The applicability of the AOX TaqMan assays was evaluated through the screening of commercial feed samples, and by the analysis of plant mixtures with known composition. The RT-qPCR methodology allowed the detection of the most abundant species in feeds but also the identification of contaminant species present in lower amounts, down to 1% w/w. AOX-based methodology provides a suitable molecular marker approach to ascertain plant species composition of animal feed samples, thus supporting feed control and enforcement of the feed sector and animal production."

Six lactating, rumen-cannulated Danish Holstein cows were used in a cross-over study with two periods. Periods included two cows on a control diet and two cows on a SARA challenge. The control diet was a total mixed ration containing 45.5% dry matter (DM), 43.8% DM neutral detergent fiber, and 19.6% DM starch. The SARA challenge was conducted by gradually substituting the control diet with pellets containing 50% wheat and 50% barley over 3 days to reach a diet containing 55.6% DM, 31.3% DM neutral detergent fiber, and 31.8% DM starch, which was fed for four more days. Rumen fluid samples were collected at day 7 and 10 of experimental periods. Feces samples were collected on days 8 and 10 of these periods. Extracted DNA from the rumen and feces samples was analyzed to assess their bacterial communities using MiSeq Illumina sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. The induction of SARA reduced the richness, diversity, and stability of bacterial communities and resulted in distinctly different microbiota in the rumen and feces. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes were the most abundant phyla and, combined, they represented 76.9 and 94.4% of the bacterial community in the rumen fluid and the feces, respectively. Only the relative abundance of Firmicutes in the rumen was increased by the SARA challenge. In rumen fluid and feces, the abundances of nine out of the 90 and 25 out of the 89 taxa, respectively, were affected by the challenge. Hence, SARA challenge altered the composition of the bacterial community at the lower taxonomical level in the feces and therefore also likely in the hindgut, as well as in the rumen. However, only reductions in the bacterial richness and diversity in the rumen fluid and feces were in agreement with those of other studies and had a biological basis. Although the composition of the bacterial community of the feces was affected by the SARA challenge, bacterial taxa in the feces that can be used for accurate and non-invasive diagnosis of SARA could not be identified."

"29518233","abstracttext","Saccharomyces cerevisiae variety diastaticus is generally considered to be an obligatory spoilage microorganism and spoilage yeast in beer and beer-mixed beverages. Their super-attenuating ability causes increased carbon dioxide concentrations, beer gushing and potential bottle explosion along with changes in flavor, sedimentation and increased turbidity. This research shows clear differences in the super-attenuating properties of S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus yeast strains and their potential for industrial brewing applications. Nineteen unknown spoilage yeast cultures were obtained as isolates and characterized using a broad spectrum of genetic and phenotypic methods. Results indicated that all isolates represent genetically different S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus strains except for strain TUM PI BA 124. Yeast strains were screened for their super-attenuating ability and sporulation. Even if the STA1 gene responsible for super-attenuation by encoding for the enzyme glucoamylase could be verified by real-time polymerase chain reaction, no correlation to the spoilage potential could be demonstrated. Seven strains were further characterized focusing on brewing and sensory properties according to the yeast characterization platform developed by Meier-Dörnberg. Yeast strain TUM 3-H-2 cannot metabolize dextrin and soluble starch and showed no spoilage potential or super-attenuating ability even when the strain belongs to the species S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus. Overall, the beer produced with S. cerevisiae var. diastaticus has a dry and winey body with noticeable phenolic off-flavors desirable in German wheat beers."

"29531066","abstracttext","The understanding and mitigation of the appearance of herbicide-resistant weeds have come to the forefront of study in the past decade, as the number of weed species that are resistant to one or more herbicide modes of action is on the increase. Historically, weed resistance to auxin herbicides has been rare, but examples, such as Kochia scoparia L. Schrad (kochia), have appeared, posing a challenge to conventional agricultural practices. Reports of dicamba-resistant kochia populations began in the early 1990s in areas where auxin herbicides were heavily utilized for weed control in corn and wheat cropping systems, and some biotypes are resistant to other auxin herbicides as well. We have further characterized the auxin responses of one previously reported dicamba-resistant biotype isolated from western Nebraska and found that it is additionally cross-resistant to other auxin herbicides, including 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) and fluroxypyr. We have utilized transcriptome sequencing and comparison to identify a 2-nt base change in this biotype, which results in a glycine to asparagine amino acid change within a highly conserved region of an AUX/indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) protein, KsIAA16. Through yeast two-hybrid analysis, characterization of F2 segregation, and heterologous expression and characterization of the gene in Arabidopsis thaliana , we show that that the single dominant KsIAA16R resistance allele is the causal basis for dicamba resistance in this population. Furthermore, we report the development of a molecular marker to identify this allele in populations and facilitate inheritance studies. We also report that the resistance allele confers a fitness penalty in greenhouse studies."
"28744278","articletitle","Fungal Communities in Rhizosphere Soil under Conservation Tillage Shift in Response to Plant Growth."
"28744278","abstracttext","Conservation tillage is an extensively used agricultural practice in northern China that alters soil texture and nutrient conditions, causing changes in the soil microbial community. However, how conservation tillage affects rhizosphere and bulk soil fungal communities during plant growth remains unclear. The present study investigated the effect of long-term (6 years) conservation (chisel plow, zero) and conventional (plow) tillage during wheat growth on the rhizosphere fungal community, using high-throughput sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene and quantitative PCR. During tillering, fungal alpha diversity in both rhizosphere and bulk soil were significantly higher under zero tillage compared to other methods. Although tillage had no significant effect during the flowering stage, fungal alpha diversity at this stage was significantly different between rhizosphere and bulk soils, with bulk soil presenting the highest diversity. This was also reflected in the phylogenetic structure of the communities, as rhizosphere soil communities underwent a greater shift from tillering to flowering compared to bulk soil communities. In general, less variation in community structure was observed under zero tillage compared to plow and chisel plow treatments. Changes in the relative abundance of the fungal orders Capnodiales, Pleosporales, and Xylariales contributed the highest to the dissimilarities observed. Structural equation models revealed that the soil fungal communities under the three tillage regimes were likely influenced by the changes in soil properties associated with plant growth. This study suggested that: (1) differences in nutrient resources between rhizosphere and bulk soils can select for different types of fungi thereby increasing community variation during plant growth; (2) tillage can alter fungal communities' variability, with zero tillage promoting more stable communities. This work suggests that long-term changes in tillage regimes may result in unique soil fungal ecology, which might influence other aspects of soil functioning (e.g., decomposition)."

"29686728","abstracttext_background","Metabolism of carbon bound in wheat arabinoxylan (WAX) polysaccharides by bacteria requires a number of glycoside hydrolases active toward different bonds between sugars and other molecules. Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius is a Gram-positive thermoacidophilic bacterium capable of growth on a variety of mono-, di-, oligo-, and polysaccharides. Nineteen proposed glycoside hydrolases have been annotated in the A. acidocaldarius Type Strain ATCC27009/DSM 446 genome. Experiments were performed to understand the effect of monosaccharides on gene expression during growth on the polysaccharide, WAX."
"29686728","abstracttext_results","Molecular analysis using high-density oligonucleotide microarrays was performed on A. acidocaldarius strain ATCC27009 when growing on WAX. When a culture growing exponentially at the expense of arabinoxylan saccharides was challenged with glucose or xylose, most glycoside hydrolases were downregulated. Interestingly, regulation was more intense when xylose was added to the culture than when glucose was added, showing a clear departure from classical carbon catabolite repression demonstrated by many Gram-positive bacteria. In silico analyses of the regulated glycoside hydrolases, along with the results from the microarray analyses, yielded a potential mechanism for arabinoxylan metabolism by A. acidocaldarius . Glycoside hydrolases expressed by this strain may have broad substrate specificity, and initial hydrolysis is catalyzed by an extracellular xylanase, while subsequent steps are likely performed inside the growing cell."
"29686728","abstracttext_conclusions","Glycoside hydrolases, for the most part, appear to be found in clusters, throughout the A. acidocaldarius genome. Not all of the glycoside hydrolase genes found at loci within these clusters were regulated during the experiment, indicating that a specific subset of the 19 glycoside hydrolase genes found in A. acidocaldarius were used during metabolism of WAX. While specific functions of the glycoside hydrolases were not tested as part of the research discussed, many of the glycoside hydrolases found in the A. acidocaldarius Type Strain appear to have a broader substrate range than that represented by the glycoside hydrolase family in which the enzymes were categorized."

"29540194","abstracttext_background","MADS-box genes are categorized into A, B, C, D and E classes and are involved in floral organ identity and flowering. Sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel) is an important perennial forage grass and adapts well to many adverse environments. However, there are few studies on the molecular mechanisms of flower development in sheepgrass, especially studies on MADS-domain proteins."
"29540194","abstracttext_results","In this study, we cloned 11 MADS-box genes from sheepgrass (Leymus chinensis (Trin.) Tzvel), and phylogenetic analysis of the 11 genes with their homologs revealed that they are divided into nine subclades. Tissue-specific expression profile analysis showed that most of these MADS-box genes were highly expressed in floral organs. LcMADS1 and LcMADS3 showed higher expression in the stamen than in the other tissues, and LcMADS7 showed high expression in the stamen, glume, lemma and palea, while expression of LcMADS2, LcMADS9 and LcMADS11 was higher in vegetative organs than floral organs. Furthermore, yeast two-hybrid analyses showed that LcMADS2 interacted with LcMADS7 and LcMADS9. LcMADS3 interacted with LcMADS4, LcMADS7 and LcMADS10, while LcMADS1 could interact with only LcMADS7. Interestingly, the expression of LcMADS1 and LcMADS2 were significantly induced by cold, and LcMADS9 was significantly up-regulated by NaCl."

"29085968","articletitle","Evolution of the Aux/IAA Gene Family in Hexaploid Wheat."
"29085968","abstracttext","The Aux/IAA (IAA) gene family, involved in the auxin signalling pathway, acts as an important regulator in plant growth and development. In this study, we explored the evolutionary trajectory of the IAA family in common wheat. The results showed ten pairs of paralogs among 34 TaIAA family members. Seven of the pairs might have undergone segmental duplication, and the other three pairs appear to have experienced tandem duplication. Except for TaIAA15-16, these duplication events occurred in the ancestral genomes before the divergence of Triticeae. After that point, two polyploidization events shaped the current TaIAA family consisting of three subgenomic copies. The structure or expression pattern of the TaIAA family begins to differentiate in the hexaploid genome, where TaIAAs in the D genome lost more genes (eight) and protein secondary structures (α1, α3 and β5) than did the other two genomes. Expression analysis showed that six members of the TaIAA family were not expressed, and members such as TaIAA8, 15, 16, 28 and 33 exhibited tissue-specific expression patterns. In addition, three of the ten pairs of paralogs (TaIAA5-12, TaIAA15-16 and TaIAA29-30) showed similar expression patterns, and another five paralog pairs displayed differential expression patterns. Phylogenetic analysis showed that paralog pairs with high rates of evolution (ω > ω 0 ), particularly TaIAA15-16 and TaIAA29-30, experienced greater motif loss, with only zero to two interacting IAA proteins. In contrast, most paralogous genes with low ω, such as TaIAA5-12, had more complete motifs and higher degrees of interaction with other family members."

"28827159","abstracttext","The use of correlation networks and hierarchical cluster analysis provides a framework to organize and study the coordination of parameters such as genes, metabolites, proteins and physiological parameters. We have analyzed 142 traits from primary C and N metabolism, including biochemical and gene expression analyses, in a range of 32 different growth conditions (various [CO 2 ] levels, temperatures, N supplies, growth stages and experimental methods). To test the integration of primary metabolism, particularly under climate change, we investigated which C and N metabolic traits and transcript levels are correlated in durum wheat flag leaves using a correlation network and a hierarchical cluster analysis. There was a high amount of positive correlation between traits involved in a wide range of biological processes, suggesting a close and intricate coordination between C-N metabolisms at the biochemical and transcriptional levels. Transcript levels for genes related to N uptake and assimilation were especially coexpressed with genes belonging to the respiratory pathway, highlighting the coordination between the synthesis of organic N compounds and provision of energy and C skeletons. Also involved in this coordination were Rubisco and nitrate reductase activities, which play a key role in the regulation of plant metabolism. Carbohydrate accumulation was linked with a down-regulation of photosynthetic and N metabolism genes and nitrate reductase activity. Based on the degree of connectivity between nodes, network exploration facilitated the identification of some traits that may be biologically relevant during plant abiotic stress tolerance, as most of them are involved in limiting steps of plant metabolism."

"28898288","abstracttext","In the dryland Pacific Northwest wheat cropping systems, no-till is becoming more prevalent as a way to reduce soil erosion and fuel inputs. Tillage can have a profound effect on microbial communities and soilborne fungal pathogens, such as Rhizoctonia. We compared the fungal communities in long-term no-till (NT) plots adjacent to conventionally tilled (CT) plots, over three years at two locations in Washington state and one location in Idaho, US. We used pyrosequencing of the fungal ITS gene and identified 422 OTUs after rarefication. Fungal richness was higher in NT compared to CT, in two of the locations. Humicola nigrescens, Cryptococcus terreus, Cadophora spp. Hydnodontaceae spp., and Exophiala spp. were more abundant in NT, while species of Glarea, Coniochaetales, Mycosphaerella tassiana, Cryptococcus bhutanensis, Chaetomium perlucidum, and Ulocladium chartarum were more abundant in CT in most locations. Other abundant groups that did not show any trends were Fusarium, Mortierella, Penicillium, Aspergillus, and Macroventuria. Plant pathogens such as Rhizoctonia (Ceratobasidiaceae) were not abundant enough to see tillage differences, but Microdochium bolleyi, a weak root pathogen, was more abundant in NT. Our results suggest that NT fungi are better adapted at utilizing intact, decaying roots as a food source and may exist as root endophytes. CT fungi can utilize mature plant residues that are turned into the soil with tillage as pioneer colonizers, and then produce large numbers of conidia. But a larger proportion of the fungal community is not affected by tillage and may be niche generalists."

"28871543","abstracttext","Respiration traits allow calculating temperature-dependent carbon use efficiency and prediction of growth rates. This protocol aims (1) to enable validation of respiration traits as non-DNA biomarkers for breeding on robust plants in support of sustainable and healthy plant production; (2) to provide an efficient, novel way to identify and predict functionality of DNA-based markers (genes, polymorphisms, edited genes, transgenes, genomes, and hologenomes), and (3) to directly help farmers select robust material appropriate for a specified region. The protocol is based on applying isothermal calorespirometry and consists of four steps: plant tissue preparation, calorespirometry measurements, data processing, and final validation through massive field-based data.The methodology can serve selection and improvement for a wide range of crops. Several of them are currently being tested in the author's lab. Among them are important cereals, such as wheat, barley, and rye, and diverse vegetables. However, it is critical that the protocol for measuring respiration traits be well adjusted to the plant species by considering deep knowledge on the specific physiology and functional cell biology behind the final target trait for production. Here, Daucus carota L. is chosen as an advanced example to demonstrate critical species-specific steps for protocol development. Carrot is an important global vegetable that is grown worldwide and in all climate regions (moderate, subtropical, and tropical). Recently, this species is also used in my lab as a model for studies on alternative oxidase (AOX) gene diversity and evolutionary dynamics in interaction with endophytes."

Plant metabolomics has been exercised for understanding the fine-tuning of the potential pathways to surmount the adverse effects of drought stress. A broad spectrum of morphological and metabolic responses from seven Triticeae species including wild types with different drought tolerance/susceptibility level was investigated under control and water scarcity conditions."
"29246190","abstracttext_results","Significant morphological parameters measured were root length, surface area, average root diameter and overall root development. Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least-Squares-Discriminant Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis were applied to the metabolomic data obtained by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry technique in order to determine the important metabolites of the drought tolerance across seven different Triticeae species. The metabolites showing significant accumulation under the drought stress were considered as the key metabolites and correlated with potential biochemical pathways, enzymes or gene locations for a better understanding of the tolerance mechanisms. In all tested species, 45 significantly active metabolites with possible roles in drought stress were identified. Twenty-one metabolites out of forty-five including sugars, amino acids, organic acids and low molecular weight compounds increased in both leaf and root samples of TR39477, IG132864 and Bolal under the drought stress, contrasting to TTD-22, Tosunbey, Ligustica and Meyeri samples. Three metabolites including succinate, aspartate and trehalose were selected for further genome analysis due to their increased levels in TR39477, IG132864, and Bolal upon drought stress treatment as well as their significant role in energy producing biochemical pathways."

"28954838","abstracttext","Background: Changes in whole-grain chemical composition can affect the site of nutrient digestion, which may alter substrate availability and gut microbiota composition. Objective: This study elucidated the function of whole-grain fermentable fiber composition on ileal substrate flow, hindgut substrate availability, and subsequent gut microbial profiles in pigs. Methods: Five whole grains- 1 ) high-fermentability, high-β-glucan hull-less barley (HFB); 2 ) high-fermentability, high-amylose hull-less barley (HFA); 3 ) moderate-fermentability hull-less barley (MFB); 4 ) low-fermentability hulled barley (LFB); or 5 ) low-fermentability hard red spring wheat (LFW)-were included at 800 g/kg into diets fed to ileal-cannulated growing pigs for 9 d in a 6 (periods) × 5 (diets) Youden square. Digesta were analyzed for nutrient flow and microbial composition via 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. Results: The consumption of fermentable whole grains, HFB, and HFA increased ( P < 0.05) ileal starch flow by 69% and dry matter flow by 37% compared with LFB and LFW intakes. The consumption of HFB and HFA increased ( P < 0.05) fecal Firmicutes phylum abundance by 26% and 21% compared with LFB intake and increased ( P < 0.05) fecal Dialister genus abundance, on average, by 98% compared with LFB and LFW intakes. Fecal Sharpea and Ruminococcus genera abundances increased ( P < 0.05) with HFB intake compared with LFB and LFW intakes. In contrast, the consumption of LFB increased ( P < 0.05) fecal Bacteroidetes phylum abundance by 43% compared with MFB intake. Ileal starch flow and fecal Firmicutes abundance were positively correlated and determined by using principal components analysis. Conclusions: Increasing dietary fermentable fiber from whole grains can increase ileal substrate flow and hindgut substrate availability, shifting the fecal microbiota toward Firmicutes phylum members. Thus, digesta substrate flow is important to shape gut microbial profiles in pigs, which indicates that the manipulation of substrate flow should be considered as a tool to modulate gut microbiota composition."

"29696332","abstracttext","Mushrooms are an important food crop throughout the world. The most important edible mushroom is the button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which comprises about 30% of the global mushroom market. This species is cultivated commercially on a selective compost that is produced predominantly from wheat straw/stable bedding and chicken manure, at a moisture content of around 70% (w/w) and temperatures of up to 80 °C. Large volumes of water are required to achieve this moisture content, and many producers therefore collect leachate from the composting windrows and bunkers (known in the industry as ""goody water"") and reuse it to wet the raw ingredients. This has the benefit of recycling and saving water and has the potential to enrich beneficial microorganisms that stimulate composting, but also the risk of enhancing pathogen populations that could reduce productivity. Here, we show by 16S rRNA gene sequencing that mushroom compost leachate contains a high diversity of unknown microbes, with most of the species found affiliated with the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. However, by far the most abundant species was the thermophile Thermus thermophilus, which made up approximately 50% of the bacterial population present. Although the leachate was routinely collected and stored in an aerated central storage tank, many of the bacterial species found in leachate were facultative anaerobes. However, there was no evidence for sulfide production, and no sulfate-reducing bacterial species were detected. Because T. thermophilus is important in the high temperature phase of composting, the use of recycled leachate as an inoculum for the raw materials is likely to be beneficial for the composting process."

"29856884","abstracttext","Pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.] is an important ""orphan"" cereal and the most widely grown of all the millet species worldwide. It is also the sixth most important cereal in the world after wheat, rice, maize, barley, and sorghum, being largely grown and used in West Africa as well as in India and Pakistan. The present study was carried out in the frame of a program designed to increase benefits and reduce potential health problems deriving from the consumption of pearl millet. The specific goal was to provide a database of information on the variability existing in pearl millet germplasm as to the amounts of phytate, the most relevant antinutrient compound, and the goitrogenic compounds C-glycosylflavones (C-GFs) accumulated in the grain.Results we obtained clearly show that, as indicated by the range in values, a substantial variability subsists across the investigated pearl millet inbred lines as regards the grain level of phytic acid phosphate, while the amount of C-GFs shows a very high variation. Suitable potential parents to be used in breeding programs can be therefore chosen from the surveyed material in order to create new germplasm with increased nutritional quality and food safety. Moreover, we report novel molecular data showing which genes are more relevant for phytic acid biosynthesis in the seeds as well as a preliminary analysis of a pearl millet orthologous gene for C-GFs biosynthesis. These results open the way to dissect the genetic determinants controlling key seed nutritional phenotypes and to the characterization of their impact on grain nutritional value in pearl millet."

"30805251","abstracttext","The methylated flavone tricin has been associated with numerous health benefits, including reductions in intestinal and colon cancers in animal models. Tricin is found in a wide range of plant species and in many different tissues. However, whole cereal grains, such as rice, barley, oats, and wheat, are the only food sources of tricin, which is located in the bran portion of the grain. Variation in tricin levels was found in bran from rice genotypes with light brown, brown, red, and purple pericarp color, with the purple pericarp genotypes having the highest levels of tricin. Here, we analyzed tricin and tricin derivative levels in developing pericarp and embryo samples of a purple pericarp genotype, IAC600, that had high tricin and tricin derivative levels in the bran, and a light brown pericarp genotype, Cocodrie, that had no detectable tricin or tricin derivatives in the bran. Tricin and tricin derivatives were detected in both the pericarp and embryo of IAC600 but only in the embryo of Cocodrie. The purple pericarp rice had higher total levels of free tricin plus tricin derivatives than the light brown pericarp rice. When expressed on a per grain basis, most of the tricin component of IAC600 was in the pericarp. In contrast, Cocodrie had no detectable tricin in the pericarp samples but did have detectable chrysoeriol, a precursor of tricin, in the pericarp samples. We also used RNA-Seq analysis of developing pericarp and embryo samples of the two cultivars to compare the expression of genes involved in the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. The results presented here suggest that understanding the basis of tricin accumulation in rice pericarp may lead to an approach to increasing tricin levels in whole grain rice. From analysis of gene expression levels in the pericarp samples it appears that regulation of the flavone specific genes is independent of regulation of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. It therefore may be feasible to develop brown pericarp rice cultivars that accumulate tricin in the pericarp."

"30998448","abstracttext","The deployment of diverse sources of resistance in new cultivars underpins durable control of rust diseases. Aus27430 exhibited a moderate level of stripe rust resistance against Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) pathotypes currently prevalent in Australia. Aus27430 was crossed with the susceptible parent Avocet S (AvS) and subsequent filial generations were raised. Monogenic segregation observed among Aus27430/AvS F 3 families was confirmed through stripe rust screening of an F 6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, and the resistance locus was temporarily named YrAW5 . Selective genotyping using an Illumina iSelect 90K wheat SNP bead chip array located YrAW5 in chromosome 6A. Genetic mapping of the RIL population with linked 90K SNPs that were converted into PCR-based marker assays, as well as SSR markers previously mapped to chromosome 6A, confirmed the chromosomal assignment for YrAW5 . Comparative analysis of other stripe rust resistance genes located in chromosome 6A led to the formal designation of YrAW5 as Yr81 . Tests with a marker linked with Yr18 also demonstrated the presence of this gene in Aus27430. Yr18 interacted with Yr81 to produce stripe rust responses lower than those produced by RILs carrying these genes individually. Although gwm459 showed higher recombination with Yr81 compared with the other flanking marker KASP _ 3077 , it amplified the AvS allele in 80 cultivars, whereas KASP_3077 amplified AvS allele in 67 cultivars. Both markers can be used in marker-assisted selection after confirming parental polymorphism."

"31003610","abstracttext","Improved genetic, genomic and statistical technologies have increased the capacity to enrich breeding populations for key alleles underpinning adaptation and continued genetic gain. In turn, directed genomic selection together with increased heritability will reduce genetic variance to narrow the genetic base in many crop breeding programs. Diverse genetic resources (GR), including wild and weedy relatives, landraces and reconstituted synthetics, have potential to contribute novel alleles for key traits. Targeted trait identification may also identify genetic diversity in addressing new challenges including the need for modified root architecture, greater nutrient-use efficiency, and adaptation to warmer air and soil temperatures forecast with climate change. Yet while core collections and other GR sources have historically been invaluable for major gene control of disease and subsoil constraints, the mining of genetically (and phenotypically) complex traits in GR remains a significant challenge owing to reduced fertility, limited seed quantities and poor adaptation through linkage drag with undesirable alleles. High-throughput field phenomics (HTFP) offers the opportunity to capture phenotypically complex variation underpinning adaptation in traditional phenotypic selection or statistics-based breeding programs. Targeted HTFP will permit the reliable phenotyping of greater numbers of GR-derived breeding lines using smaller plot sizes and at earlier stages of population development to reduce the duration of breeding cycles and the loss of potentially important alleles with linkage drag. Two key opportunities are highlighted for use of HTFP in selection among GR-derived wheat breeding lines for greater biomass and stomatal conductance through canopy temperature."
"31096549","articletitle","Impact of Five Succinate Dehydrogenase Inhibitors on DON Biosynthesis of Fusarium asiaticum , Causing Fusarium Head Blight in Wheat."
"31096549","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a class of mycotoxin produced in cereal crops infected with Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC). In China, FGSC mainly includes Fusarium asiaticum and F. graminearum . DON belongs to the trichothecenes and poses a serious threat to the safety and health of humans and animals. Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitors (SDHIs) are a class of fungicides that act on succinate dehydrogenase and inhibit the respiration of pathogenic fungi. In this study, the fungicidal activities of five SDHIs, including fluopyram, flutolanil, boscalid, benzovindiflupyr, and fluxapyroxad, against FGSC were determined based on mycelial growth and spore germination inhibition methods. The five SDHIs exhibited better inhibitory activities in spore germination than mycelial growth. Fluopyram exhibited a higher inhibitory effect in mycelial growth and spore germination in comparison to the other four SDHIs. In addition, the biological characteristics of F. asiaticum as affected by the five SDHIs were determined. We found that these five SDHIs decreased DON, pyruvic acid and acetyl-CoA production, isocitrate dehydrogenase mitochondrial (ICDHm) and SDH activities, and NADH and ATP content of F. asiaticum but increased the citric acid content. In addition, TRI5 gene expression was inhibited, and the formation of toxisomes was disrupted by the five SDHIs, further confirming that SDHIs can decrease DON biosynthesis of F. asiaticum . Thus, we concluded that SDHIs may decrease DON biosynthesis of F. asiaticum by inhibiting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. Overall, the findings from the study will provide important references for managing Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by FGSC and reducing DON contamination in F. asiaticum -infected wheat grains."

"31039395","abstracttext","The advantages of high input agriculture are fading away due to degenerating soil health and adverse effects of climate change. Safeguarding crop yields in the changing environment and dynamics of pest and pathogens, has posed new challenges to global agriculture. Thus, integration of new technologies in crop improvement has been imperative for achieving the breeding objectives in faster ways. Recently, enormous potential of genome editing through engineered nucleases has been demonstrated in plants. Continuous refinements of the genome editing tools have increased depth and breadth of their applications. So far, genome editing has been demonstrated in more than fifty plant species. These include model species like Arabidopsis, as well as important crops like rice, wheat, maize etc. Particularly, CRISPR/Cas9 based two component genome editing system has been facile with wider applicability. Potential of genome editing has unfurled enormous possibilities for engineering diverse agronomic traits including durable resistance against insect-pests and pathogens. Novel propositions of developing insect and pathogen resistant crops by genome editing include altering the effector-target interaction, knocking out of host-susceptibility genes, engineering synthetic immune receptor eliciting broad spectrum resistance, uncoupling of antagonistic action of defense hormones etc. Alternatively, modification of insect genomes has been used either to create gene drive or to counteract resistance to various insecticides. The distinct advantage of genome editing system is that it can knock out specific target region in the genome without leaving the unwanted vector backbone. In this article, we have reviewed the novel opportunities offered by the genome editing technologies for developing insect and pathogen resistant crop-types, their future prospects and anticipated challenges."

"31122440","abstracttext","This article reports the identification, engineering and characterisation of recombinant single chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody against Zearalenone (ZEN), an oestrogenic mycotoxin, using phage display antibody technology. To increase the chance of obtaining clones that can bind to free toxin, the conjugated proteins of the target antigen, i.e. bovine serum albumin ZEN-BSA and ovalbumin ZEN-OVA, were switched during the biopanning. One phage-displayed scFv clone specific to free ZEN, designated yZEN2A8, could be isolated. The gene encoding the yZEN2A8 scFv was sub-cloned into the pET-21d (+) and pKP300 delta III vectors to generate the recombinant scFv and scFv-AP antibody formats, respectively. After ELISA optimisation by checkerboard titration, the sensitivities of the recombinant yZEN2A8 scFv antibody and scFv-AP fusion were improved approx. 2 and 60 folds, respectively. Competitive ELISA indicated that the median inhibition concentration (IC 50 ) of recombinant yZEN2A8 scFv antibody and scFv-AP fusion after ELISA optimisation were 90 and 14 ng mL -1 , with a limit of detection (LOD) of 20 and 2 ng mL -1 , respectively. No cross-reactivity to other common mycotoxins was observed. Homology modelling illustrated specific binding of the recombinant antibody to ZEN and demonstrated the role of complementary determining regions (CDRs) of both the variable heavy and light chains in antibody-antigen interactions. Efficient application of scFv-AP for the detection of ZEN contamination in corns and wheat samples were investigated for the first time. The antibody in the form of scFv-AP can be used as a prototype for the development of a convenient reagent for the detection of ZEN contamination in various format, including biosensor-based."

"31157218","abstracttext","Pathogen detection, identification, and tracking is shifting from non-molecular methods, DNA fingerprinting methods, and single gene methods to methods relying on whole genomes. Viral Ebola and influenza genome data are being used for real-time tracking, while food-borne bacterial pathogen outbreaks and hospital outbreaks are investigated using whole genomes in the UK, Canada, the USA and the other countries. Also, plant pathogen genomes are starting to be used to investigate plant disease epidemics such as the wheat blast outbreak in Bangladesh. While these genome-based approaches provide never-seen advantages over all previous approaches with regard to public health and biosecurity, they also come with new vulnerabilities and risks with regard to cybersecurity. The more we rely on genome databases, the more likely these databases will become targets for cyber-attacks to interfere with public health and biosecurity systems by compromising their integrity, taking them hostage, or manipulating the data they contain. Also, while there is the potential to collect pathogen genomic data from infected individuals or agricultural and food products during disease outbreaks to improve disease modeling and forecast, how to protect the privacy of individuals, growers, and retailers is another major cyberbiosecurity challenge. As data become linkable to other data sources, individuals and groups become identifiable and potential malicious activities targeting those identified become feasible. Here, we define a number of potential cybersecurity weaknesses in today's pathogen genome databases to raise awareness, and we provide potential solutions to strengthen cyberbiosecurity during the development of the next generation of pathogen genome databases."
"30862623","articletitle","Use of F2 Bulks in Training Sets for Genomic Prediction of Combining Ability and Hybrid Performance."
"30862623","abstracttext","Developing training sets for genomic prediction in hybrid crops requires producing hybrid seed for a large number of entries. In autogamous crop species ( e.g. , wheat, rice, rapeseed, cotton) this requires elaborate hybridization systems to prevent self-pollination and presents a significant impediment to the implementation of hybrid breeding in general and genomic selection in particular. An alternative to F1 hybrids are bulks of F2 seed from selfed F1 plants (F1:2). Seed production for F1:2 bulks requires no hybridization system because the number of F1 plants needed for producing enough F1:2 seed for multi-environment testing can be generated by hand-pollination. This study evaluated the suitability of F1:2 bulks for use in training sets for genomic prediction of F1 level general combining ability and hybrid performance, under different degrees of divergence between heterotic groups and modes of gene action, using quantitative genetic theory and simulation of a genomic prediction experiment. The simulation, backed by theory, showed that F1:2 training sets are expected to have a lower prediction accuracy relative to F1 training sets, particularly when heterotic groups have strongly diverged. The accuracy penalty, however, was only modest and mostly because of a lower heritability, rather than because of a difference in F1 and F1:2 genetic values. It is concluded that resorting to F1:2 bulks is, in theory at least, a promising approach to remove the significant complication of a hybridization system from the breeding process."

"30984773","abstracttext","We investigated how the microbiota in the ileum and cecum of broiler chickens fed a diet of low calcium (Ca) and available phosphorus (aP) and prebiotic fructooligosaccharides (FOS) supplements changed over a 3 weeks period. Three dietary treatments were randomly assigned to four replicate cages of five birds each, including: positive control (PC), a wheat-corn-soybean meal-based diet; negative control (NC), as PC with 0.2% reduced Ca and aP; and NC + FOS, as NC supplemented with 0.5% of FOS. Ileal and cecal digesta were sampled from each replicate ( n = 4) on d21 and processed for 16S rRNA gene amplicon (V4 region) sequencing using Illumina platform. Statistical differences were observed in the microbiome by GI location as determined by 2-way ANOVA and Permutational MANOVA. On average, 24,216 sequence reads per sample were generated resulting in 800 and 1,280 operational taxonomic units in the ileal and cecal digesta, respectively. Difference ( P < 0.0001) on alpha diversity and abundances of several phyla was observed between ileal and cecal digesta. ß-diversity was different ( P < 0.05) between each treatment groups in the ileum but not in the cecum. In the cecum, species richness, phylogenetic diversity, and the number of observed species were higher in PC compared to NC + FOS ( P < 0.05). Several phyla, including Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria, had significantly different abundance in the ileal and cecal digesta ( P < 0.05). In the ileal digesta, positive correlation were observed between Salinibacterium and Lysobacter and PC diet. Blautia, Faecalibacterium and Pseudomonas and the NC diet and Lactobacillus and Escherichia and the NC + FOS diet. In the cecal digesta, Butyrivibrio , and Allobaculum were positively correlated to PC. Although, Clostridium and Anaerotruncus were positively correlated to NC + FOS, they showed negative correlation to PC and NC. The study concludes that dietary Ca and aP level and FOS supplementation alters ileal microbiota of the broiler chickens."

"32153323","abstracttext","Alteration in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration and other environmental factors are the significant cues of global climate change. Environmental factors affect the most fundamental biological process including photosynthesis and different metabolic pathways. The feeding of the rapidly growing world population is another challenge which imposes pressure to improve productivity and quality of the existing crops. C 4 plants are considered the most productive, containing lower photorespiration, and higher water-use & N-assimilation efficiencies, compared to C 3 plants. Besides, the C 4 -photosynthetic genes not only play an important role in carbon assimilation but also modulate abiotic stresses. In this review, fundamental three metabolic processes (C 4 , C 3 , and CAM) of carbon dioxide assimilation, the evolution of C 4 -photosynthetic genes, effect of elevated CO 2 on photosynthesis, and overexpression of C 4 -photosynthetic genes for higher photosynthesis were discussed. Kranz-anatomy is considered an essential prerequisite for the terrestrial C 4 carbon assimilation, but single-celled C 4 plant species changed this well-established paradigm. C 4 plants are insensitive to an elevated CO 2 stress condition but performed better under stress conditions. Overexpression of essential C 4 -photosynthetic genes such as PEPC , PPDK , and NADP - ME in C 3 plants like Arabidopsis , tobacco, rice, wheat, and potato not only improved photosynthesis but also provided tolerance to various environmental stresses, especially drought. The review provides useful information for sustainable productivity and yield under elevated CO 2 environment, which to be explored further for CO 2 assimilation and also abiotic stress tolerance. Additionally, it provides a better understanding to explore C 4 -photosynthetic gene(s) to cope with global warming and prospective adverse climatic changes."

"32120878","abstracttext","Plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial strain S58 was isolated from the tobacco rhizosphere. It showed strong antagonism against a battery of plant pathogenic fungi and bacteria, and controlled wheat sharp eyespot and tobacco wildfire diseases efficiently. Further tests showed that strain S58 solubilized organic phosphate and produced siderophore, protease, ammonia, and indole-3-acetic acid. In Arabidopsis thaliana, it promoted plant growth and changed root system architecture by restricting the growth of primary roots and increasing lateral root numbers. We relied on morphological, biochemical, physiological characteristics, and molecular phylogenic analysis to identify strain S58 as Pseudomonas mediterranea . The complete genome of strain S58 has a single circular chromosome of 6,150,838 bp with a 61.06% G+C content. The bacterial genome contained 5,312 predicted genes with an average length of 992.90 bp. A genome analysis suggested that P. mediterranea S58 was a rich cyclic lipopeptide (CLP)-producing strain that possessed seven non-ribosomal peptide gene clusters for CLP synthesis. Leaf inoculation of the bacterial culture and supernatants triggered cell death-like immunity in tobacco. Quantitative real-time PCR assays showed that the strain S58 induced the expression of pattern-triggered immunity and cell death marker genes, but not jasmonic acid marker genes. The results suggested that P. mediterranea S58 is a novel, versatile plant growth-promoting agent with multiple beneficial traits for plants."

"32252770","abstracttext","Phytases are widely utilized in feed industry to increase the utilization of phosphorus, minerals, and amino acids for improvement of animal and human nutrition. At present, all known β-propeller phytases (BPP) have been generated from bacteria, particularly Bacillus. In this work we report for the first time a new fungal-derived BPP phytase. We identified a phytase highly differentially expressed only in the parasitic stage of a nematophagous fungus, Arhtrobotrys oliogospora, during the development of the 3D traps. We found that this phytase was homologous to the known bacterial BPP phytase, thus we referred the new phytase to Aophytase. The heterologous expression of codon-optimized Aophytase gene in Pichia pastoris was successfully investigated to yield recombinant Aophytase (r-Aophytase) with high specific enzyme activity of 74.71 U/mg, much higher than those of recombinant BPP phytases derived bacteria. The kinetic parameters of the r-Aophytase, the optimum pH and temperature, as well as the effects of surfactant, EDTA and different ions on its enzyme activity were further investigated. The potential utilization of r-Aophytase in feed processing was finally explored. We found that the optimal pH value was about 7.5, and the optimal temperature was 50 °C.; r-Aophytase significantly increased the release of inorganic phosphorus from soybean meal, and improved the release of soluble minerals from the durum wheat flour and finger millet flour. The findings indicate its potential utilization in the feed processing to ameliorate nutritional value of cereals and animal feed in the future."

"32252812","abstracttext_background","The soil environment is responsible for sustaining most terrestrial plant life, yet we know surprisingly little about the important functions carried out by diverse microbial communities in soil. Soil microbes that inhabit the channels of decaying root systems, the detritusphere, are likely to be essential for plant growth and health, as these channels are the preferred locations of new root growth. Understanding the microbial metagenome of the detritusphere, and how it responds to agricultural management such as crop rotations and soil tillage, is vital for improving global food production."

"32256170","abstracttext","Generally, under normal conditions plants are resistant to many of the incompatible pathogens (viral, fungal and bacterial), and this is named ""non-host resistance phenomenon"". To understand this phenomenon, different types of food crops (faba bean, squash, barley and wheat) were inoculated with compatible and incompatible pathogens. Strong resistance symptoms were observed in the non-host/incompatible pathogen combinations as compared with host/compatible pathogen combinations, which showed severe infection (susceptibility). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) mostly hydrogen peroxide and superoxide were significantly increased early 24 and 48 h after inoculation (hai) in the non-host plants comparing to the host. Antioxidant enzymes activity (catalase, polyphenol oxidase and peroxidase) were not increased at the same early time 24, 48 hai in the non-host resistant and host resistant plants, however, it increased later at 72 and 168 hai. Electrolyte leakage decreased significantly in non-host resistant and host resistant/pathogen combinations. Catalase and peroxidase genes were significantly expressed in non-host resistant and in host resistant plants as compared to the host susceptible one, which did not show expression using RT-PCR technique. Furthermore, Yr5 , Yr18 and Yr26 resistant genes were identified positively using PCR in all treatments either host susceptible or non-host resistant plants in which prove that no clear role of these resistant genes in resistance. Early accumulation of ROS could have a dual roles, first role is preventing the growth or killing the pathogens early in the non-host, second, stimulating the gene appearance of related genes in addition the activition of antioxidant enzymes later on which thereby, neutralize the harmful effect of ROS and consequently suppressing disease symptoms. The new finding from this study supporting the plant breeders with new source of resistance to develop new resistant cultivars and/or stop the breakdown of resistance in resistant cultivars."

"32249395","abstracttext","In this study, the metagenomic resource generated from an aquatic habitat of extreme temperature was screened for the identification of a novel xylanase, Xyn M1 . Gene sequence analysis designated it as a member of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 10. The metagenomic DNA fragment was cloned, expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein was biochemically characterized. The optimum temperature and pH for the Xyn M1 xylanase were found to be at 80 °C and 7, respectively. It exhibited worthwhile pH stability by retaining about 70% activity in the range of pH 6 to 9 after the exposure for 12 h at 25 °C. Thermostability analysis established considerable heat tolerance in Xyn M1 protein at elevated temperatures, displaying about 50% residual activity after the exposure of 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C, and 70 °C for 20 h, 12 h, 6 h, and 1.5 h, respectively. The effects of additives such as metals, surfactants, and organic solvents were evaluated on the activity of Xyn M1 . It was able to retain about 50% of its initial activity in the presence of NaCl concentration of 1 to 5 M. The novel xylanase was capable of hydrolyzing the hemicellulosic polymer, derived from diverse biomass sources, e.g., beechwood xylan, wheat arabinoxylan, corncob xylan, and sweet sorghum xylan. The Xyn M1 -treated beechwood xylan manifested catalytic release of xylooligosaccharides (XOS) of 2-6 DP. The novel GH10 xylanase is a promising biocatalyst that could be ascribed for biomass conversion and production of prebiotic XOS biomolecules."

"32265455","abstracttext","This study was initiated to identify genomic regions conferring resistance to Karnal Bunt (KB) disease in wheat through a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a set of 179 pre-breeding lines (PBLs). A GWAS of 6,382 high-quality DArTseq SNPs revealed 15 significant SNPs (P-value <10 -3 ) on chromosomes 2D, 3B, 4D and 7B that were associated with KB resistance in individual years. In particular, two SNPs (chromosome 4D) had the maximum R 2 values: SNP 1114200 | F | 0-63:T > C at 1.571 cM and R 2 of 12.49% and SNP 1103052 | F | 0-61:C > A at 1.574 cM and R 2 of 9.02%. These two SNPs displayed strong linkage disequilibrium (LD). An in silico analysis of SNPs on chromosome 4D identified two candidate gene hits, TraesCS4D02G352200 (TaNox8; an NADPH oxidase) and TraesCS4D02G350300 (a rhomboid-like protein belonging to family S54), with SNPs 1103052 | F | 0-61:C > A and 1101835 | F | 0-5:C > A, respectively, both of which function in biotic stress tolerance.

"32226437","articletitle","Long Non-coding RNA in Plants in the Era of Reference Sequences."
"32226437","abstracttext","The discovery of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), and the subsequent elucidation of their functional roles, was largely delayed due to the misidentification of non-protein-coding parts of DNA as ""junk DNA,"" which forced ncRNAs into the shadows of their protein-coding counterparts. However, over the past decade, insight into the important regulatory roles of ncRNAs has led to rapid progress in their identification and characterization. Of the different types of ncRNAs, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), has attracted considerable attention due to their mRNA-like structures and gene regulatory functions in plant stress responses. While RNA sequencing has been commonly used for mining lncRNAs, a lack of widespread conservation at the sequence level in addition to relatively low and highly tissue-specific expression patterns challenges high-throughput in silico identification approaches. The complex folding characteristics of lncRNA molecules also complicate target predictions, as the knowledge about the interaction interfaces between lncRNAs and potential targets is insufficient. Progress in characterizing lncRNAs and their targets from different species may hold the key to efficient identification of this class of ncRNAs from transcriptomic and potentially genomic resources. In wheat and barley, two of the most important crops, the knowledge about lncRNAs is very limited. However, recently published high-quality genomes of these crops are considered as promising resources for the identification of not only lncRNAs, but any class of molecules. Considering the increasing demand for food, these resources should be used efficiently to discover molecular mechanisms lying behind development and a/biotic stress responses. As our understanding of lncRNAs expands, interactions among ncRNA classes, as well as interactions with the coding sequences, will likely define novel functional networks that may be modulated for crop improvement."

"32318981","abstracttext","Gracilibacillus dipsosauri is a moderately-halophilic Gram-positive bacterium which forms an extracellular α-amylase that is induced by starch, repressed by D-glucose, and active in 2.0 M KCl. Previous studies showed that while enzyme activity could be measured with the synthetic substrate 2-chloro-4-nitrophenyl-α-D-maltotrioside (CNPG3), other assays were inconsistent and the protein showed aberrant mobility during nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. To clarify the properties of this enzyme, the genome of G. dipsosauri was sequenced and was found to be 4.19 Mb in size with an overall G+C content of 36.9%. A gene encoding an α-amylase composed of 691 amino acids was identified. The protein was a member of the glycosyl hydrolase 13 family, which had a molecular mass of 77,396 daltons and a pI of 4.39 due to an unusually large number of aspartate and glutamate residues (95/691 or 13.7%). BLAST analysis of the amino acid sequence revealed significant matches to other proteins with cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase activity. Partial purification of the protein from G. dipsosauri showed that fractions catalyzing the hydrolysis of CNPG3 and p-nitrophenyl-D-maltoheptoside also catalyzed the formation of β-cyclodextrin but not α-cyclodextrin or γ-cyclodextrin. Formation of β-cyclodextrin was not stimulated by high salt concentrations but did occur with rice, potato, wheat, and corn starches and amylopectin. These studies explain the unusual features of the α-amylase from G. dipsosauri and indicate it should be classified as EC 2.4.1.19. The availability of the complete genomic sequence of G. dipsosauri will provide the basis for studies on other enzymes from this halophile which may be useful for biotechnology."

"32277460","abstracttext","Biotechnological methods for targeted gene transfers into plants are key for successful breeding in the twenty-first century and thus essential for the survival of humanity. Two decades ago, genetic transformation of crop plants was not routine, and it was all but impossible with important cereals such as barley and wheat. The recent focus on crop plant genomics-yet based on the Arabidopsis toolbox-boosted the research for more efficient plant transformation protocols, thereby considerably widened the number of genetically tractable crops. Moreover, modern genome editing methods such as the CRISPR/Cas technique are game changers in plant breeding, though heavily dependent on technical optimization of plant transformation. Basically, there are two successful ways of introducing DNA into plant cells: one is making use of a living DNA vector, namely, microbes such as the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens that infects plants and naturally transfers and subsequently integrates DNA into the plant genome. The other method uses a direct physical transfer of DNA by means of microinjection, microprojectile bombardment, or polymers such as polyethylene glycol. Both ways subsequently require sophisticated strategies for selecting and multiplying the transformed cells under tissue culture conditions to develop into a fully functional plant with the new desirable characteristics. Here we discuss practical and theoretical aspects of cereal crop plant transformation by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and microparticle bombardment. Using immature embryos as explants, the efficiency of cereal transformation is compelling, reaching today up to 80% transformation efficiency."

In this regard, technologies upgradation in the field of genome editing looks promising. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 is a rapidly growing genome editing technique being effectively applied in different organisms, that includes both model and crop plants.

Availability of whole genome sequence information for number of crops along with the advancement in genome-editing techniques provides several possibilities to achieve desirable traits. In this review, the options available for crop improvement by implementing CRISPR/Cas9 based genome-editing techniques with special emphasis on cereal crops have been summarized. Recent advances providing opportunities to simultaneously edit many target genes were also discussed.

"32676069","abstracttext","Over the past years, gut microbiota became a major field of interest with increasing reports suggesting its association with a large number of human diseases. In this context, there is a major interest to develop analysis tools allowing simple and cost-effective population pattern analysis of these complex ecosystems to follow changes over time. Whereas sequence-based metagenomics profiling is widely used for microbial ecosystems characterization, it still requires time and specific expertise for analysis. Flow cytometry overcomes these disadvantages, providing key information on communities within hours. In addition, it can potentially be used to select, isolate and cultivate specific bacteria of interest. In this study, we evaluated the culturability of strictly anaerobic bacteria that were stained with a classical Live/Dead staining, and then sorted using flow cytometry under anaerobic conditions. This sorting of ""viable"" fraction demonstrated that 10-80% of identified ""viable"" cells of pure cultures of strictly anaerobic bacteria were culturable. In addition, we tested the use of a combination of labeled vancomycin and Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA) lectin to discriminate Gram-positive from Gram-negative bacteria in complex ecosystems. After validation on both aerobic/anaerobic facultative and strictly anaerobic bacteria, the staining methods were applied on complex ecosystems, revealing differences between culture conditions and demonstrating that minor pH variations have strong impacts on microbial community structure, which was confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. This combination of staining methods makes it possible to follow-up evolutions of complex microbial communities, supporting its future use as a rapid analysis tool in various applications. The flow cytometry staining method that was developed has the potential to facilitate the analysis of complex ecosystems by highlighting changes in bacterial communities' dynamics. It is assumed to be applicable as an efficient and fast approach to improve the control of processes linked to a wide range of ecosystems or known communities of bacterial species in both research and industrial contexts."

Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive disease of wheat worldwide, leading to severe yield and quality losses. The genetic basis of native FHB resistance was examined in two populations: a recombinant inbred line population from the cross Cutler/AC Barrie and a doubled haploid (DH) population from the cross AC Barrie/Reeder. Numerous QTL were detected among the two mapping populations with many being cross-specific. Photoperiod insensitivity at Ppd-D1 and dwarfing at Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 was associated with increased FHB susceptibility. Anthesis date QTL at or near the Vrn-A1 and Vrn-B1 loci co-located with major FHB-resistance QTL in the AC Barrie/Reeder population. The loci were epistatic for both traits, such that DH lines with both late alleles were considerably later to anthesis and had reduced FHB symptoms (i.e., responsible for the epistatic interaction). Interestingly, AC Barrie contributed FHB resistance near the Fhb1 locus in the Cutler population and susceptibility in the Reeder population. Analyses of the Fhb1 candidate genes PFT and TaHRC confirmed that AC Barrie, Cutler, and Reeder do not carry the Sumai-3 Fhb1 gene. Resistance QTL were also detected at the expected locations of Fhb2 and Fhb5. The native FHB-resistance QTL detected near Fhb1, Fhb2, and Fhb5 do not appear to be as effective as Fhb1, Fhb2, and Fhb5 from Sumai-3. The presence of awns segregated at the B1 awn inhibitor locus in both populations, but was only associated with FHB resistance in the Cutler/AC Barrie population suggesting linkage caused the association rather than pleiotropy."

"30086701","abstracttext_background","Understanding the mechanisms that underlie the diversification of herbivores through interactions with their hosts is important for their diversity assessment and identification of expansion events, particularly in a human-altered world where evolutionary processes can be exacerbated. We studied patterns of host usage and genetic structure in the wheat curl mite complex (WCM), Aceria tosichella, a major pest of the world's grain industry, to identify the factors behind its extensive diversification."
"30086701","abstracttext_results","We expanded on previous phylogenetic research, demonstrating deep lineage diversification within the taxon, a complex of distinctive host specialist and generalist lineages more diverse than previously assumed. Time-calibrated phylogenetic reconstruction inferred from mitochondrial DNA sequence data suggests that lineage diversification pre-dates the influence of agricultural practices, and lineages started to radiate in the mid Miocene when major radiations of C4 grasses is known to have occurred. Furthermore, we demonstrated that host specificity is not phylogenetically constrained, while host generalization appears to be a more derived trait coinciding with the expansion of the world's grasslands. Demographic history of specialist lineages have been more stable when compared to generalists, and their expansion pre-dated all generalist lineages. The lack of host-associated genetic structure of generalists indicates gene flow between mite populations from different hosts."
"30086701","abstracttext_conclusions","Our analyses demonstrated that WCM is an unexpectedly diverse complex of genetic lineages and its differentiation is likely associated with the time of diversification and expansion of its hosts. Signatures of demographic histories and expansion of generalists are consistent with the observed proliferation of the globally most common lineages. The apparent lack of constrains on host use, coupled with a high colonization potential, hinders mite management, which may be further compromised by host range expansion. This study provides a significant contribution to the growing literature on host-association and diversification in herbivorous invertebrates."

"30026749","articletitle","Measuring Activity of Native Plant Sirtuins - The Wheat Mitochondrial Model."
"30026749","abstracttext","Sirtuins are NAD + -dependent deacetylase enzymes that have gained considerable interest in mammals for their recognized importance in gene silencing and expression and in cell metabolism. Conversely, knowledge about plant sirtuins remains limited, although a sirtuin-mediated regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism has been recently reported in Arabidopsis . However, so far, no information is available about direct measurement of intracellular plant sirtuin activity, i.e., in cell extracts and/or subcellular organelles. In this study, a novel approach was proposed for reliable evaluation of native sirtuin activity in plant samples, based on (i) an adequate combinatory application of enzymatic assays very different for chemical basis and rationale and (ii) a comparative measurement of activity of a recombinant sirtuin isoform. In particular, two sirtuin assays were applied, based on bioluminescence emission and Homogeneous Time-Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF ® ) technology, and the human SIRT1 isoform (hSIRT1) was used for comparison. For the first time in plants, this new approach allowed measuring directly a high and nicotinamide-sensitive sirtuin activity in highly purified mitochondrial fraction obtained from durum wheat (WM). WM-sirtuin activity was 268 ± 10 mU⋅mg -1 protein, as measured by HTRF ® assay, and 166 ± 12 ng hSIRT1 eq.⋅mg -1 protein, as evaluated by the bioluminescent assay and calculated on the basis of the hSIRT1 calibration curve. Moreover, effects of resveratrol and quercetin, reported as potent hSIRT1 activators, but whose activation mechanism is still debated, were also studied. No effect of resveratrol was found on both WM-sirtuin and hSIRT1 activities, while only a slight increase, up to about 20%, of hSIRT1 activity by quercetin was observed. In the whole, results of this study indicate that WM may represent a good system for studying native plant sirtuins. In fact, the high yield of purified WM and their high sirtuin activity, together with use of microplate readers, allow performing a large number of measurements from the same preparation, so qualifying the approach for application to large-scale high-throughput screening. Moreover, WM may also represent an excellent tool to investigate physiological role and modulation of plant sirtuins under experimental conditions more physiologically relevant with respect to recombinant purified enzymes."

"30061923","abstracttext_background","Plant biomass conversion for green chemistry and bio-energy is a current challenge for a modern sustainable bioeconomy. The complex polyaromatic lignin polymers in raw biomass feedstocks (i.e., agriculture and forestry by-products) are major obstacles for biomass conversions. White-rot fungi are wood decayers able to degrade all polymers from lignocellulosic biomass including cellulose, hemicelluloses, and lignin. The white-rot fungus Polyporus brumalis efficiently breaks down lignin and is regarded as having a high potential for the initial treatment of plant biomass in its conversion to bio-energy. Here, we describe the extraordinary ability of P. brumalis for lignin degradation using its enzymatic arsenal to break down wheat straw, a lignocellulosic substrate that is considered as a biomass feedstock worldwide."
"30061923","abstracttext_results","We performed integrative multi-omics analyses by combining data from the fungal genome, transcriptomes, and secretomes. We found that the fungus possessed an unexpectedly large set of genes coding for Class II peroxidases involved in lignin degradation (19 genes) and GMC oxidoreductases/dehydrogenases involved in generating the hydrogen peroxide required for lignin peroxidase activity and promoting redox cycling of the fungal enzymes involved in oxidative cleavage of lignocellulose polymers (36 genes). The examination of interrelated multi-omics patterns revealed that eleven Class II Peroxidases were secreted by the fungus during fermentation and eight of them where tightly co-regulated with redox cycling enzymatic partners."
"30061923","abstracttext_conclusion","As a peculiar feature of P. brumalis , we observed gene family extension, up-regulation and secretion of an abundant set of versatile peroxidases and manganese peroxidases, compared with other Polyporales species. The orchestrated secretion of an abundant set of these delignifying enzymes and redox cycling enzymatic partners could contribute to the delignification capabilities of the fungus. Our findings highlight the diversity of wood decay mechanisms present in Polyporales and the potentiality of further exploring this taxonomic order for enzymatic functions of biotechnological interest."
"30259379","articletitle","Circular RNAs and Plant Stress Responses."
"30259379","abstracttext","Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a novel class of noncoding RNAs that have been extensively explored in the past few years. The advent of new high-throughput sequencing technologies coupled with bioinformatics tools revealed the presence of these molecules in the transcriptome of a wide range of organisms. In animals, circRNAs can modulate gene expression and act as sponges of miRNAs to inhibit their activity. It has been demonstrated that they have the potential to be diagnostic biomarkers as their expression is closely associated to human diseases, such as Alzheimer and cancer. However, in plants their function remains elusive. Recently, the role of the circRNAs in plant stress responses has been studied. During the infection of Pseudomonas syringae in kiwifruit plants, 584 circRNAs were differentially expressed in leaf samples, and a group of them could be further associated with the stage of infection. Under phosphate deficiency conditions, 27 rice circRNAs were reported to be differentially expressed. In tomato, 163 circRNAs demonstrated chilling-responsive expression, with 102 containing miRNA-binding sites and are predicted to act as miRNA sponges. Additionally, Arabidopsis seedlings presented 1583 heat-specific circRNAs, and it was also reported that heat stress could increase the quantity, length, and alternative circularization events of circRNAs. Finally, wheat seedlings under dehydration stress had 62 circRNAs differentially expressed, with 6 being predicted as miRNA sponges. Although the role of plant circRNAs during the biotic and abiotic stresses is still poorly characterised, these molecules have the potential to expand the number of targets and tools in the biotechnology field."
"30460727","articletitle","Effects of methionine on muscle protein synthesis and degradation pathways in broilers."
"30460727","abstracttext","This study investigated the hypothesis that supplementation of methionine (Met) to broiler diets increases muscle growth due to regulation of molecular pathways related to protein synthesis and degradation depending on the Met source. Day-old male Cobb-500 broilers (n = 240) were phase-fed three different wheat-soya bean meal-based basal diets during days 1-10, 11-21 and 22-35. Basal diets (Met- group, Met + Cys concentration 15% below NRC recommendations) were supplemented with 0.10% or 0.40% Met either as DL-Met (DLM) or DL-2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio) butanoic acid (DL-HMTBA) (equimolar comparison). Breast muscle weights were lower in the Met- group compared to all Met-supplemented groups and were lower in broilers supplemented with 0.10% of DL-HMTBA compared to the other groups fed Met-supplemented diets. However, the expression of genes or relative phosphorylation and thus activation state of proteins involved in the somatotropic axis, the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway of protein synthesis, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP) and autophagy-lysosomal pathway of protein degradation, the GCN2/eIF2a pathway involved in the inhibition of protein synthesis and in the myostatin-Smad2/3 pathway involved in myogenesis were not affected by Met source. Feeding diets with suboptimum Met + Cys concentrations, however, decreased expression of GHR and IGF1 in liver and muscle and increased that of MURF1 involved in the UPP in the broiler's muscle at day 10 and 21, while that of FOXO and atrogin-1 and FOXO phosphorylation remained unaffected. Additionally, suboptimum dietary Met concentrations increased expression of the autophagy-related genes ATG5 and BECN1 at day 35. Met supplementation neither affected gene expression nor phosphorylation of proteins involved in the GNC2/eIF2a and mTOR pathways. These data indicate that protein synthesis was not affected on the molecular level, while protein degradation was marginally affected by dietary Met dosage."

"30545051","abstracttext","The study evaluated the symptoms, acceptance, and digestibility of bread made from transgenic low-gliadin wheat, in comparison with gluten free bread, in Non-coeliac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) patients, considering clinical/sensory parameters and gut microbiota composition. This study was performed in two phases of seven days each, comprising a basal phase with gluten free bread and an E82 phase with low-gliadin bread. Gastrointestinal clinical symptoms were evaluated using the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) questionnaire, and stool samples were collected for gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) determination and the extraction of gut microbial DNA. For the basal and E82 phases, seven and five patients, respectively, showed undetectable GIPs content. The bacterial 16S rRNA gene V1-V2 hypervariable regions were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq platform and downstream analysis was done using a Quantitative Insights into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) pipeline. No significant differences in the GSRS questionnaires were observed between the two phases. However, we observed a significantly lower abundance of some gut genera Oscillospira , Dorea , Blautia , Bacteroides , Coprococcus , and Collinsella, and a significantly higher abundance of Roseburia and Faecalibacterium genera during the E82 phase compared with the basal phase. The consumption of low-gliadin bread E82 by NCGS subjects induced potentially positive changes in the gut microbiota composition, increasing the butyrate-producing bacteria and favoring a microbial profile that is suggested to have a key role in the maintenance or improvement of gut permeability."
"30571987","articletitle","Real-time PCR quantification of Fusarium avenaceum in soil and seeds."
"30571987","abstracttext","The pathogenic fungus Fusarium avenaceum infects a broad range of plant hosts across the globe. While primarily soilborne, F. avenaceum can colonize all plant tissues, including buds, seeds, fruits, stems, crowns, and roots, resulting in significant crop yield reductions and economic losses for growers. In addition to its impact on crop productivity, F. avenaceum produces toxic metabolites that can be transferred to humans and livestock through consumption of infected foods. The ability of F. avenaceum to cause seed decay may be utilized to deplete the weed seedbank in soil, an important integrated weed management strategy. We developed a SYBR Green I-based real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay to efficiently detect and quantify F. avenaceum in soil, wild oat (Avena fatua L.) seed caryopses, and wild oat seed hulls. The primer pair was designed from the translation elongation factor 1-alpha (TEF1) gene. In silico and wet lab testing were done to assess the ability of the primers to bind TEF1 sequences from Fusarium spp. and common soil fungi. The findings indicated that the primers were specific to F. avenaceum, and also recognized GenBank TEF1 accessions annotated as F. arthrosporioides, which has been listed as a foliar pathogen of wheat in Oregon, and conspecific with F. avenaceum. Standard curves of F. avenaceum DNA diluted with soil, caryopsis, or hull extracts indicated primer amplification efficiency was not significantly affected by PCR inhibitors. This real-time PCR assay effectively assesses the presence and abundance of F. avenaceum and its close relative F. arthrosporioides, if present, in soil and seed tissues. The assay can be used for endpoint PCR as well."

"30379913","abstracttext","The ToxA effector is a major virulence gene of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), a necrotrophic fungus and the causal agent of tan spot disease of wheat. ToxA and co-located genes are believed to be the result of a recent horizontally transferred highly conserved 14kb region a major pathogenic event for Ptr. Since this event, monitoring isolates for pathogenic changes has become important to help understand the underlying mechanisms in play. Here we examined ToxA in 100 Ptr isolates from Australia, Europe, North and South America and the Middle East, and uncovered in isolates from Denmark, Germany and New Zealand a new variation, a novel 166 bp insertion element (PtrHp1) which can form a perfectly matched 59 bp inverted repeat hairpin structure located downstream of the ToxA coding sequence in the 3' UTR exon. A wider examination revealed PtrHp1 elements to be distributed throughout the genome. Analysis of genomes from Australia and North America had 50-112 perfect copies that often overlap other genes. The hairpin element appears to be unique to Ptr and the lack of ancient origins in other species suggests that PtrHp1 emerged after Ptr speciation. Furthermore, the ToxA UTR insertion site is identical for different isolates, which suggests a single insertion event occurred after the ToxA horizontal transfer. In vitro and in planta-detached leaf assays found that the PtrHp1 element insertion had no effect on ToxA expression. However, variation in the expression of ToxA was detected between the Ptr isolates from different demographic locations, which appears to be unrelated to the presence of the element. We envision that this discovery may contribute towards future understanding of the possible role of hairpin elements in Ptr."

"30408134","abstracttext","Due to their complex chemical and physical properties, the effects and mechanisms of action of natural sources of dietary fiber on the intestine are unclear. Pigs are commonly fed high-fiber diets to reduce production costs and non-starch polysaccharide (NSP)-degrading enzymes have been used to increase fiber digestibility. We evaluated the expression of mucin 2 (MUC2), presence of goblet cells, and ileal immune profile of pigs housed individually for 28 days and fed either a low fiber diet based on corn-soybean meal (CSB, n = 9), or two high fiber diets formulated adding 40% corn distillers' dried grains with solubles (DDGS, n = 9) or 30% wheat middlings (WM, n = 9) to CSB-based diet. Pigs were also fed those diets supplemented with a NSP enzymes mix (E) of xylanase, β-glucanase, mannanase, and galactosidase (n = 8, 10, and 9 for CSB+E, DDGS+E and WM+E, respectively). Feeding DDGS and WM diets increased ileal MUC2 expression compared with CSB diet, and this effect was reversed by the addition of enzymes. There were no differences in abundance of goblet cells among treatments. In general, enzyme supplementation increased gene expression and concentrations of IL-1β, and reduced the concentrations of IL-4, IL-17A and IL-11. The effects of diet-induced cytokines on modulating intestinal MUC2 were assessed in vitro by treating mouse and swine enteroids with 1 ng/ml of IL-4 and IL-1β. In accordance with previous studies, treatment with Il-4 induced Muc2 and expansion of goblet cells in mouse enteroids. However, swine enteroids did not change MUC2 expression or number of goblet cells when treated with IL-4 or IL-1β. Our results suggest that mucin and immune profile are regulated by diet in the swine intestine, but by mechanisms different to mouse, emphasizing the need for using appropriate models to study responses to dietary fiber in swine."

"30754579","abstracttext","The tritimovirus Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) is widespread throughout the world and represents a severe threat to cereal crop production. To increase knowledge of genetic diversity of WSMV in Europe, until now scarce, capsid protein (CP) sequences of several Czech, French, Italian, Slovak, and Turkish isolates have been determined. A multiple alignment of CP nucleotide sequences using available WSMV sequences revealed only limited sequence variation among 3 previously sequenced European isolates and the 14 European isolates sequenced in this study. Moreover, these isolates were characterized by an identical 3-nucleotide deletion, resulting in the lack of the Gly 2761 codon within the CP region of the polyprotein. The results indicate that this monophyletic group of isolates (designated as WSMV-ΔE) is common and widely dispersed throughout the European continent. The close relationship of WSMV-ΔE isolates implies a single common ancestor and, presumably, subsequent dispersal throughout Europe from a single focus. We developed two simple assays for specific and accurate detection of WSMV-ΔE isolates. First, a conserved ClaI restriction site in the core CP gene sequence unique to WSMV-ΔE isolates was used for restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of amplified polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products. Second, the conserved and specific codon gap in WSMV-ΔE sequences was used as a target to design specific primers functional in one-step reverse-transcription PCR detection of WSMV-ΔE isolates."

"30780655","abstracttext","Isolates of two biologically and phylogenetically distinct species, referred to as Fusarium solani f. sp. cucurbitae race 1 (Fsc-1 = Nectria haematococca mating population I [MPI]) and F. solani f. sp. cucurbitae race 2 (Fsc-2 = N. haematococca mating population V [MPV]), were suspected of causing an outbreak of Fusarium foot and fruit rot of pumpkin during 2001 to 2003 in Connecticut, New York, Ohio, and Missouri. Both species affect the fruit, but Fsc-1 also affects the crown and causes a stem rot. In this study, 156 isolates from affected plants and from soil under diseased fruit that tentatively were identified morphologically as members of the F. solani species complex were assayed for pathogenicity on pumpkin seedlings and mature fruit. Results of the pathogenicity assay indicated that 81 of the isolates were Fsc-1. The remaining 74 isolates were either nonpathogenic or only weakly pathogenic on the fruit. A subset of 53 test isolates from soil and plants, plus reference isolates of Fsc-1 and Fsc-2 and an isolate from wheat reported to cause a seedling rot on cucurbits, were characterized phylogenetically by sequencing a portion of the translation elongation factor 1-α gene. A BLAST query of the FUSARIUM-ID database at Pennsylvania State University indicated that 42 of the 53 test isolates were Fsc-1, whereas none were typed as Fsc-2. A polymerase chain reaction assay for mating-type (MAT) idiomorph revealed that all of the Fsc-1 isolates were MAT-1-2, suggesting that the pathogen may be strictly clonal in the affected fields. These findings provide convincing evidence that the Fusarium foot and fruit rot outbreaks were incited by Fsc-1."

"30847106","abstracttext","Weed resistance to herbicide can be conferred by gene mutations, and some mutations can cause pleiotropic effects in some cases. We investigated the pleiotropic effects associated with five specific ACCase mutations (Ile1781Leu, Trp2027Cys, Ile2041Asn, Asp2078Gly, and Gly2096Ala) on the plant growth, seed production, and resource competitiveness in American sloughgrass.Resistant plants (M/M) homozygous for specific ACCase mutation and susceptible wild-type plants (W/W) were derived from single heterozygous mother plant (M/W) by genotyping. Plant growth assay and neighborhood experiments were performed to quantify variation between M/M plants and W/W plants.The Ile1781Leu mutation resulted in slight increases in plant growth in pure stands and improved resource competitiveness under low-competition conditions in pot experiments, but no clear variation was observed under high competitive pressure or field conditions. During competition with wheat plants under field conditions, American sloughgrass plants containing Ile2041Asn ACCase exhibited a significantly lower (12.5%) aboveground biomass but no distinct differences in seed production or resource competitiveness. No significant detrimental pleiotropic effects associated with Gly2096Ala were detected in American sloughgrass.The Trp2027Cys mutation distinctly reduced seed production, especially under high competitive pressure, but did not significantly alter plant growth. The Asp2078Gly mutation consistently reduced not only plant growth and seed production but also resource competitiveness. Synthesis . The Trp2027Cys and Asp2078Gly mutations led to significant fitness costs, which may reduce the frequency of resistance alleles and reduce the propagation speed of resistant weeds in the absence of ACCase inhibitor herbicides. The Ile1781Leu, Ile2041Asn, and Gly2096Ala mutations displayed no obvious fitness costs or displayed very small fitness penalties, which would likely have no effect on the establishment of resistant weeds in the field."

"30800135","abstracttext","Plant parasitic nematodes secrete effectors into host plant tissues to facilitate parasitism. In this study, we identified a G16B09-like effector protein family from the transcriptome of Heterodera avenae , and then verified that most of the members could suppress programmed cell death triggered by BAX in Nicotiana benthamiana . Ha18764, the most homologous to G16B09, was further characterized for its function. Our experimental evidence suggested that Ha18764 was specifically expressed in the dorsal gland and was dramatically upregulated in the J4 stage of nematode development. A Magnaporthe oryzae secretion system in barley showed that the signal peptide of Ha18764 had secretion activity to deliver mCherry into plant cells. Arabidopsis thaliana overexpressing Ha18764 or Hs18764 was more susceptible to Heterodera schachtii . In contrast, BSMV-based host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) targeting Ha18764 attenuated H. avenae parasitism and its reproduction in wheat plants. Transient expression of Ha18764 suppressed PsojNIP, Avr3a/R3a, RBP-1/Gpa2, and MAPK kinases (MKK1 and NPK1 Nt )-related cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana . Co-expression assays indicated that Ha18764 also suppressed cell death triggered by four H. avenae putative cell-death-inducing effectors. Moreover, Ha18764 was also shown strong PTI suppression such as reducing the expression of plant defense-related genes, the burst of reactive oxygen species, and the deposition of cell wall callose. Together, our results indicate that Ha18764 promotes parasitism, probably by suppressing plant PTI and ETI signaling in the parasitic stages of H. avenae ."

"30939734","abstracttext","In plants, pollen grain transfers the haploid male genetic material from anther to stigma, both between flowers (cross-pollination) and within the same flower (self-pollination). In order to better understand chemical hybridizing agent (CHA) SQ-1-induced pollen abortion in wheat, comparative cytological and proteomic analyses were conducted. Results indicated that pollen grains underwent serious structural injury, including cell division abnormality, nutritional deficiencies, pollen wall defect and pollen grain malformations in the CHA-SQ-1-treated plants, resulting in pollen abortion and male sterility. A total of 61 proteins showed statistically significant differences in abundance, among which 18 proteins were highly abundant and 43 proteins were less abundant in CHA-SQ-1 treated plants. 60 proteins were successfully identified using MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry. These proteins were found to be involved in pollen maturation and showed a change in the abundance of a battery of proteins involved in multiple biological processes, including pollen development, carbohydrate and energy metabolism, stress response, protein metabolism. Interactions between these proteins were predicted using bioinformatics analysis. Gene ontology and pathway analyses revealed that the majority of the identified proteins were involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism. Accordingly, a protein-protein interaction network involving in pollen abortion was proposed. These results provide information for the molecular events underlying CHA-SQ-1-induced pollen abortion and may serve as an additional guide for practical hybrid breeding."

"30289499","abstracttext","A total of 90 male Ross 308 broiler chicks were used in a digestibility and performance bioassay to explore the effect of reduction in dietary protein and digestible amino acids and inclusion of an exogenous mono-component protease on amino acid digestibility, net energy, jejunal gene expression, and bird performance. Four dietary treatments were created by the supplementation, or not, of 2 control diets with a mono-component exogenous protease. The control diets were corn/wheat/soybean meal-based and were formulated to be either nutritionally adequate or reduced in protein and amino acids (around 3%). The 2 control diets were supplemented with xylanase and phytase (2000 FYT). Treatments were therefore arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial design. The reduction in diet nutrient density had no significant effect on various experimental outcomes (including bird performance, amino acid digestibility, and net energy [NE]) that were measured with the exception of a reduction in the expression of aminopeptidase N and glucose transporter 2. However, the addition of exogenous protease resulted in an increase in weight gain and a reduction in feed conversion ratio (around 4%; P < 0.05) and an increase in the digestibility of several amino acids (P < 0.05) and starch (P = 0.06). Protease addition also resulted in an increase in both apparent metabolizable energy (AME) (+73 kcal/kg; P < 0.05) and NE (+107 kcal/kg; P < 0.05). The addition of exogenous protease to the diet also increased the jejunal expression of genes responsible for peptide transport (PepT2; P < 0.01) and starch digestion (sucrase isomaltase; P = 0.06). These results confirm the efficacy of exogenous protease in broiler diets that contain both xylanase and phytase and suggest substantial beneficial effects that extend beyond protein and amino acid nutrition. The effect of exogenous protease on energy partitioning, starch digestibility and the efficiency of nitrogen cycling is an area for further study."

"30307389","abstracttext","A bacterium, designated strain CM134L-2 T , was isolated from a chitin-enriched wheat leaf microbiome in Chengdu, Sichuan province, China. It was Gram-stain-negative, strictly aerobic, non-spore-forming, motile, rod-shaped, and bright yellow in colour. Strain CM134L-2 T grew at 4-35 °C, at pH 6.0-9.0 and could use chitin as the only carbon resource. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain CM134L-2 T was most closely related to Pedobacter nanyangensis Q-4 T (97.7 %) and Pedobacter zeaxanthinifaciens TDMA-5 T (97.4 %). Digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) values between strain CM134L-2 T with these two type strains were 26.8  and 20.8 %, respectively, and average nucleotide identity (ANI) values were 83.2 and 76.2 %; these values are lower than the proposed and generally accepted species boundaries of 70 % for dDDH and 95-96 % for ANI, which suggests strain CM134L-2 T represents a novel species. The genomic DNA G+C content of strain CM134L-2 T was 39.3 mol%, menaquinone-7 was the major respiratory quinone, phosphatidylethanolamine was the major polar lipid and the major components of the cellular fatty acids were iso-C15 : 0, and C16 : 1ω7c/C16 : 1ω6c (summed feature 3); these features supported the affiliation of strain CM134L-2 T to the genus Pedobacter. Overall, strain CM134L-2 T belongs to the genus Pedobacter, but can be classified as a novel species, for which the name Pedobacter chitinilyticus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is CM134L-2 T (=CGMCC 1.16520 T =KCTC 62643 T )."

"32421925","abstracttext","Nucleotide-binding (NB) leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors (NLRs) provide resistance against several plant pathogens. We previously cloned the wheat powdery mildew resistance gene Pm21, which encodes a coiled-coil (CC) NLR that confers broad-spectrum resistance against Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. Here, we report comprehensive biochemical and functional analyses of Pm21 CC domain in Nicotiana benthamiana. Transient overexpression assay suggested that only the extended CC (eCC, amino acid residues 1-159) domain has cell-death-inducing activity, whereas the CC-containing truncations, including CC-NB and CC-NB-LRR, do not induce cell-death responses. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assay showed that the eCC domain self-associates and interacts with the NB and LRR domains in planta. These results imply that the activity of the eCC domain is inhibited by the intramolecular interactions of different domains in the absence of pathogens. We found that the LRR domain plays a crucial role in D491V-mediated full-length (FL) Pm21 autoactivation. Some mutations in the CC domain leading to the loss of Pm21 resistance to powdery mildew impaired the CC activity of cell-death induction. Two mutations (R73Q and E80K) interfered with D491V-mediated Pm21 autoactivation without affecting the cell-death-inducing activity of the eCC domain. Notably, some susceptible mutants harbouring mutations in the CC domain still exhibited cell-death-inducing activity. Taken together, these results implicate the CC domain of Pm21 in cell-death signalling and disease-resistance signalling, which are potentially independent of each other."

"32405873","abstracttext","Effect of different nitrogen levels (0, 150, and 300 kg hm -2 ) at booting stage on storage protein biosynthesis and processing quality of wheat was investigated using microstructural and ultrastructural observation, RNA sequencing, and quality analysis in this study. The results showed that the storage protein genes encoding ω- and γ-gliadin and low molecular weight glutenin subunit were upregulated at N150, and the genes encoding α- or β-gliadin and avenin-like protein were upregulated at N300. Two nitrogen levels induced expression of some interesting regulating genes, such as USE1, STX1B_2_3, SEC23, SEC24, SEC61A, HSP A1_8, HSP20, and HSP90B/TRA1. These regulatory genes were enriched in the KEGG pathway protein export, SNARE interactions in vesicular transport, and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum. The amount, morphology, and accumulation pattern of protein body in four different endosperm regions in developing caryopsis show different response to N150 and N300, of which N300 had greater influence than N150. N150 and N300 both enhanced the contents of protein components, endosperm fullness, grain hardness, and parameters of processing quality, with the latter showing a greater degree of influence. Contrary to the accumulation pattern of protein body, N300 reduced the ratio of the amount of starch granules to the area ratio of protein body to starch granule. Results suggested that the difference of different nitrogen levels affecting storage protein biosynthesis might be through affecting the expression of the encoding and regulating gene of storage protein."
"32335384","articletitle","Towards identification of molecular mechanism in which the overexpression of wheat cytosolic and plastid glutamine synthetases in tobacco enhanced drought tolerance."
"32335384","abstracttext","Glutamine synthetases (GS) play an essential role in Nitrogen assimilation. Nonetheless, information respecting the molecular functions of GS in drought tolerance (DT) is limited. Here we show that overexpressing cytosolic GS1 or plastidic GS2 gene in tobacco enhanced DT of both root and leaf tissues of the two transgenic seedlings (named as GS1-TR and GS2-TR). RNA-seq analysis on root tissues showed that 83 aquaporin (AQP) genes were identified. Among them, 37 differential expression genes (DEGs) were found in the GS1-TR roots under normal condition, and all were down-regulated; no any DEGs in the GS2-TR roots were found. Contrastingly, under drought, 28 and 32 DEGs of AQP were up-regulated in GS1-TR and GS2-TR roots, respectively. GC-MS analysis on leaf tissues showed that glutamine (Gln) concentrations were negatively correlated AQP expressions in the all four conditions, which suggests that Gln, as a signal molecule, can negatively regulate many AQP expressions. Prestress accumulation of sucrose and proline (Pro) and chlorophyll, and had higher activities of ROS scavengers also contribute the plant DT in both of the two transgenic plants under drought. In addition, 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) was up-accumulated in GS2-TR leaves solely under normal condition, which leads to its net photosynthetic rate higher than that in GS1-TR leaves. Last but not the less, the PYL-PP2C-SnRK2 core ABA-signaling pathway was uniquely activated in GS1-TR independent of drought stress (DS). Therefore, our results suggest a possible model reflecting how overexpression of wheat TaGS1 and TaGS2 regulate plant responses to drought."
"32340239","articletitle","Change of Amino Acid Residues in Idiotypic Nanobodies Enhanced the Sensitivity of Competitive Enzyme Immunoassay for Mycotoxin Ochratoxin A in Cereals."
"32340239","abstracttext","Anti-idiotypic nanobodies, usually expressed by gene engineering protocol, has been shown as a nontoxic coating antigen for toxic compound immunoassays. We here focused on how to increase immunoassay sensitivity by changing the nanobody's primary sequence. In the experiments, two anti-idiotype nanobodies against monoclonal antibody 1H2, which is specific to ochratoxin A, were obtained and named as nontoxic coating antigen 1 (NCA1) and nontoxic coating antigen 2 (NCA2). Three differences between the nanobodies were discovered. First, there are six amino acid residues (AAR) of changes in the complementarity determining region (CDR), which compose the antigen-binding site. One of them locates in CDR1 (I-L), two of them in CDR2 (G-D, E-K), and three of them in CDR3 (Y-H, Y-W). Second, the affinity constant of NCA1 was tested as 1.20 × 10 8 L mol -1 , which is about 4 times lower than that of NCA2 (5.36 × 10 8 L mol -1 ). Third, the sensitivity (50% inhibition concentration) of NCA1 for OTA was shown as 0.052 ng mL -1 , which was 3.5 times lower than that of nontoxic coating antigen 2 (0.015 ng mL -1 ). The results indicate that the AAR changes in CDR of the anti-idiotypic nanobodies, from nonpolar to polar, increasing the affinity constant may enhance the immunoassay sensitivity. In addition, by using the nontoxic coating antigen 2 to substitute the routine synthetic toxic antigen, we established an eco-friendly and green enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for rapid detection of ochratoxin A in cereals. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of optimized ELISA was 0.017 ng mL -1 with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.003 ng mL -1 . The optimized immunoassay showed that the average recoveries of spiked corn, rice, and wheat were between 80% and 114.8%, with the relative standard deviation (RSD) ranging from 3.1-12.3%. Therefore, we provided not only basic knowledge on how to improve the structure of anti-idiotype nanobody for increasing assay sensitivity, but also an available eco-friendly ELISA for ochratoxin A in cereals."

A study was conducted to determine the impact of MBM, phytase, and antibiotics (AB) on intestinal permeability and morphology, organ weights, and jejunal gene expression in Ross 308 chickens challenged with subclinical necrotic enteritis (NE). Male Ross 308-day-old chicks (672 each) were randomly allocated to 8 treatments with 6 replicate pens each housing 14 birds. A 2 × 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments was used: MBM (no or yes); AB (no or yes-Zn bacitracin 100 in S and 50 ppm in G/F and salinomycin Na 60 ppm in all phases); phytase (500 or 1,500 FTU/kg, both using 500 FTU matrix values) using wheat-SBM-canola meal diets. Birds were challenged with Eimeria spp on day 9, and C. perfringens strain EHE-NE18 on day 14 and 15. An AB × MBM interaction (P < 0.05) was detected for relative gizzard weight (with contents) being lower in birds fed MBM and AB compared to those fed MBM and no AB. A MBM × AB interaction (P > 0.01) was detected for lymphocyte counts being lower with MBM and AB compared to MBM without AB. A phytase × AB interaction (P < 0.05) was observed for villi length being increased with high phytase and no AB compared to with AB. Inclusion of MBM increased (P < 0.05) blood FICT-d concentration, whereas AB decreased it (P < 0.05). Antibiotics increased RBC (P < 0.05), Hgb (P < 0.05), and PCV (P < 0.05) and expression of Ca-binding protein, CALB1 (P > 0.05). Inclusion of MBM decreased expression of MUC2 (P < 0.05). Results indicate that dietary MBM has a detrimental effect on gut health of broilers but this may be counteracted using AB."

"30671040","abstracttext","Salicylic acid (SA) plays an important role in regulating plant defense responses against pathogens. However, pathogens have evolved ways to manipulate plant SA-mediated defense signaling. Fusarium graminearum causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) and reduces crop yields and quality by producing various mycotoxins. In this study, we aimed to identify the salicylate hydroxylase in F. graminearum and determine its role in wheat head blight development. We initially identified a gene in F. graminearum strain NRRL 46422 that encodes a putative salicylate hydroxylase (designated FgShyC ). However, the FgShyC deletion mutant showed a similar ability to degrade SA as wild-type strain 46422; nor did overexpression of FgShyC in E. coli convert SA to catechol. The results indicate that FgShyC is not involved in SA degradation. Further genome sequence analyses resulted in the identification of eight salicylate hydroxylase candidates. Upon addition of 1 mM SA, FGSG_03657 (designated FgShy1 ), was induced approximately 400-fold. Heterologous expression of FgShy1 in E. coli converted SA to catechol, confirming that FgShy1 is a salicylate hydroxylase. Deletion mutants of FgShy1 were greatly impaired but not completely blocked in SA degradation. Expression analyses of infected tissue showed that FgShy1 was induced during infection, but virulence assays revealed that deletion of FgShy1 alone was not sufficient to affect FHB severity. Although the Fgshy1 deletion mutant did not reduce pathogenicity, we cannot rule out that additional salicylate hydroxylases are present in F. graminearum and characterization of these enzymes will be necessary to fully understand the role of SA-degradation in FHB pathogenesis."

Although many genes controlling seed dormancy have been cloned from cereals, the regulatory mechanisms controlling this process are complex, and much remains unknown. The MAPK cascade is involved in many signal transduction pathways. Recently, MKK3 has been reported to be involved in the regulation of seed dormancy, but its mechanism of action is unclear."
"30671680","abstracttext_results","We found that MKKK62-overexpressing rice lines (OE) lost seed dormancy. Further analyses showed that the abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity of OE lines was decreased.

Knock-out experiments confirmed that MKK3, MAPK7, and MAPK14 were involved in the regulation of seed dormancy. The OE lines showed decreased transcript levels of OsMFT, a homolog of a gene that controls seed dormancy in wheat. The up-regulation of OsMFT in MKK3-knockout lines (OE/mkk3) and MAPK7/14-knockout lines (OE/mapk7/mapk14) indicated that the MKKK62-MKK3-MAPK7/MAPK14 system controlled seed dormancy by regulating the transcription of OsMFT."

We used 148 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from the cross of Avocet × Kundan for determining and mapping the genetic basis of adult plant resistance (APR) loci. The population was phenotyped LR and YR for three seasons in field trials conducted in Mexico and genotyped with the diversity arrays technology sequencing (DArT-Seq) and simple sequence repeat markers. The final genetic map was constructed using 2,937 polymorphic markers with an average distance of 1.29 centimorgans between markers. Inclusive composite interval mapping identified two co-located APR quantitative trait loci (QTL) for LR and YR, two LR QTL, and three YR QTL. The co-located resistance QTL on chromosome 1BL corresponded to the pleiotropic APR gene Lr46/Yr29. QLr.cim-2BL, QYr.cim-2AL, and QYr.cim-5AS could be identified as new resistance loci in this population. Lr46/Yr29 contributed 49.5 to 65.1 and 49.2 to 66.1% of LR and YR variations, respectively. The additive interaction between detected QTL showed that LR severities for RIL combining four QTL ranged between 5.3 and 25.8%, whereas the lowest YR severities were for RIL carrying QTL on chromosomes 1BL + 2AL + 6AL. The high-density DArT-Seq markers across chromosomes can be used in fine mapping of the targeted loci and development SNP markers."

"30631890","abstracttext","The soil-borne, asexual fungus Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Fol) is a causal agent of tomato wilt disease. The infection process of Fol comprises root recognition, adhesion, penetration, colonization of the root cortex and hyphal proliferation within the xylem vessels, which are under the regulation of virulence-involved transcription factors (TFs). In this study, we identified a gene, designated FolCZF1, which encodes a C 2 H 2 TF in Fol. The homologs of FolCzf1 are also known to affect pathogenicity in F. graminearum and Magnaporthe oryzae on wheat and rice, respectively. We learned that FolCZF1 transcript level is upregulated in conidia and early host infection stage, which led us to hypothesize that FolCzf1 is associated with early host infection in Fol. The FolCZF1 deletion mutant (ΔFolCZF1) exhibited defects in growth rate, conidiation, conidia morphology and a complete loss of virulence on tomato root. Further microscopic observation showed that ΔFolCZF1 can penetrate the root but the primary infection hypha cannot extend its colonization inside the host tissue, suggesting that FolCzf1 TF plays an important role in early infection. Fusaric acid, a secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium species, is suggested as a virulence factor in many crop diseases. We found that FolCzf1 plays a critical role in fusaric acid production by regulating the expression of fusaric acid biosynthesis genes. In summary, FolCzf1 is required for conidiation, secondary metabolism, and early host infection in Fol, and we propose that homologs of FolCzf1 are required for early parasitic growth in other plant pathogenic filamentous fungi."

"30633747","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major cereal disease caused by a complex of Fusarium species. These species vary in importance depending on climatic conditions, agronomic factors or host genotype. In addition, Fusarium species can release toxic secondary metabolites. These mycotoxins constitute a significant food safety concern as they have health implications in both humans and animals. The Fusarium species involved in FHB differ in their pathogenicity, ability to produce mycotoxins, and fungicide sensitivity. Accurate and exhaustive identification of Fusarium species in planta is therefore of great importance. In this study, using a new set of primers targeting the EF1α gene, the diversity of Fusarium species on cereals was evaluated using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The PCR amplification parameters and bioinformatic pipeline were optimized with mock and artificially infected grain communities and further tested on 65 field samples. Fusarium species were retrieved from mock communities and good reproducibility between different runs or PCR cycle numbers was be observed. The method enabled the detection of as few as one single Fusarium-infected grain in 10,000. Up to 17 different Fusarium species were detected in field samples of barley, durum and soft wheat harvested in France. This new set of primers enables the assessment of Fusarium diversity by high-throughput sequencing on cereal samples. It provides a more exhaustive picture of the Fusarium community than the currently used techniques based on isolation or species-specific PCR detection. This new experimental approach may be used to show changes in the composition of the Fusarium complex or to detect the emergence of new Fusarium species as far as the EF1α sequence of these species show a sufficient amount of polymorphism in the portion of sequence analyzed. Information on the distribution and prevalence of the different Fusarium species in a given geographical area, and in response to various environmental factors, is of great interest for managing the disease and predicting mycotoxin contamination risks."

"30478526","articletitle","Enhanced resistance to sclerotinia stem rot in transgenic soybean that overexpresses a wheat oxalate oxidase."
"30478526","abstracttext","Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), caused by the oxalate-secreting necrotrophic fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is one of the devastating diseases that causes significant yield loss in soybean (Glycine max). Until now, effective control of the pathogen is greatly limited by a lack of strong resistance in available commercial soybean cultivars. In this study, transgenic soybean plants overexpressing an oxalic acid (OA)-degrading oxalate oxidase gene OXO from wheat were generated and evaluated for their resistance to S. sclerotiorum. Integration and expression of the transgene were confirmed by Southern and western blot analyses. As compared with non-transformed (NT) control plants, the transgenic lines with increased oxalate oxidase activity displayed significantly reduced lesion sizes, i.e., by 58.71-82.73% reduction of lesion length in a detached stem assay (T 3 and T 4 generations) and 76.67-82.0% reduction of lesion area in a detached leaf assay (T 4 generation). The transgenic plants also showed increased tolerance to the externally applied OA (60 mM) relative to the NT controls. Consecutive resistance evaluation further confirmed an enhanced and stable resistance to S. sclerotiorum in the T 3 and T 4 transgenic lines. Similarly, decreased OA content and increased hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) levels were also observed in the transgenic leaves after S. sclerotiorum inoculation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the expression level of OXO reached a peak at 1 h and 4 h after inoculation with S. sclerotiorum. In parallel, a significant up-regulation of the hypersensitive response-related genes GmNPR1-1, GmNPR1-2, GmSGT1, and GmRAR occurred, eventually induced by increased release of H 2 O 2 at the infection sites. Interestingly, other defense-related genes such as salicylic acid-dependent genes (GmPR1, GmPR2, GmPR3, GmPR5, GmPR12 and GmPAL), and ethylene/jasmonic acid-dependent genes (GmAOS, GmPPO) also exhibited higher expression levels in the transgenic plants than in the NT controls. Our results demonstrated that overexpression of OXO enhances SSR resistance by degrading OA secreted by S. sclerotiorum and increasing H 2 O 2 levels, and eliciting defense responses mediated by multiple signaling pathways."

This increase, in conjunction with the heterogeneity and variability of the data, presents a major challenge to adopt an integrative research approach. We are facing an urgent need to effectively integrate and assimilate complementary datasets to understand the biological system as a whole. The Semantic Web offers technologies for the integration of heterogeneous data and their transformation into explicit knowledge thanks to ontologies. We have developed the Agronomic Linked Data (AgroLD- www.agrold.org), a knowledge-based system relying on Semantic Web technologies and exploiting standard domain ontologies, to integrate data about plant species of high interest for the plant science community e.g., rice, wheat, arabidopsis. We present some integration results of the project, which initially focused on genomics, proteomics and phenomics. AgroLD is now an RDF (Resource Description Format) knowledge base of 100M triples created by annotating and integrating more than 50 datasets coming from 10 data sources-such as Gramene.org and TropGeneDB-with 10 ontologies-such as the Gene Ontology and Plant Trait Ontology. Our evaluation results show users appreciate the multiple query modes which support different use cases. AgroLD's objective is to offer a domain specific knowledge platform to solve complex biological and agronomical questions related to the implication of genes/proteins in, for instances, plant disease resistance or high yield traits. We expect the resolution of these questions to facilitate the formulation of new scientific hypotheses to be validated with a knowledge-oriented approach."

"30325468","abstracttext","This study aimed to assess the effect of a commercial blend of phytogenic feed additives (PA), comprising 5% carvacrol, 3% cinnamaldehyde, and 2% capsicum oleoresin on the modulation of immune biomarkers of broiler chickens, their growth performance, dietary energy, and nutrient retention. Four-hundred day-old birds were assigned to one of four dietary treatments. Two control diets based on either wheat (WC) or maize (MC) were each given with and without PA at 100 g/t. Growth performance variables including feed intake (FI), weight gain (WG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were recorded. Dietary N-corrected apparent metabolizable energy (MEn), dry matter (DMR), nitrogen (NR), and fat retention (FR) coefficients were also determined. Gene expression of immune biomarkers (cytokines) were determined in caecal tonsil tissue from 21 d old birds. Expression of IL2, IL18, IL10, and IL17C in the caecal tonsils were upregulated (P < 0.05) in the birds fed MC-based diets compared to the WC fed birds. Feeding PA supplemented diets downregulated the expression of CD40LG (P < 0.001), IFNG, and IL6 (P < 0.05). There was a cereal type × PA interaction (P < 0.05), as expression of IFNB was downregulated in the birds fed PA supplemented MC but not WC. However, expression of IL12B was downregulated in birds fed PA supplemented WC but there was no significant (P > 0.05) change in expression levels in birds fed MC diets. Feeding MC diets gave greater FI (P < 0.001) and ME (P < 0.05), but lower FCR (P < 0.05) compared to birds fed WC diets. The WG and nutrient retention coefficients were not affected (P > 0.05) by cereal type. Supplementary PA improved FI (P < 0.05), WG (P < 0.001), FCR (P < 0.05), MEn (P < 0.05), MEn: GE ratio (P < 0.05), and FR (P < 0.05). In conclusion, dietary inclusion of PA improved overall growth performance variables, energy, and nutrient retention and intestinal cytokine expression."

"30315602","abstracttext","This study investigated the hypothesis that dietary supplementation of L-methionine (L-Met) in weaned piglets in relation to DL-methionine (DL-Met) results in a higher antioxidant status and lower need for antioxidant enzyme activation in intestinal epithelium and body tissues, and improves gut morphology and gut barrier function as well as performance. A total of 99 early-weaned 21-day old piglets were allotted to six groups and fed a semi-synthetic wheat-barley-based basal diet supplemented with 0.067%, 0.107% and 0.147% of either DL-Met (MetAmino; Evonik, Hanau, Germany) or L-Met (L-Met100; CJ Europe, Schwalbach am Taunus, Germany) to reach dietary Met concentrations of 0.16%, 0.20% and 0.24%, of which the latter met the requirements for maintenance and growth based on a pre-experiment. Feed intake and body weights were recorded weekly, and samples of plasma, liver and duodenum and jejunum mucosa were collected after 3 weeks at slaughter. Plasma concentrations of L-Met were similar, and those of D-Met and total Met were higher in piglets fed DL-Met in relation to those fed L-Met. Feed intake, daily gains and feed:gain ratio, and the relative bio-efficacy based on gains and feed:gain ratio were similar for both groups. Likewise, villi length, crypt depth, the villi length:crypt depth ratio in duodenum and jejunum and gene expression of tight junction proteins in the jejunum did not differ. Concentrations of antioxidants like glutathione and tocopherol, the total antioxidant capacity, the mRNA abundance or activity of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, concentrations of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, markers for oxidative damage of lipids and the expression of inflammatory genes were similar in liver and jejunum mucosa. These data indicate that the effects of L-Met and DL-Met supplementation are comparable considering both piglet performance and parameters of gut health and function like gut morphology and the intestinal antioxidant status."

"31854080","abstracttext_background","Relatively new herbicides that target 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) are now available for use on the world's great grain crops (rice, wheat, corn and soybean) and for other uses. With widespread and persistent use of HPPD-inhibiting herbicides, the evolution of HPPD-inhibiting herbicide resistant weeds is inevitable. Currently, resistance to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides is known in two weed species, waterhemp and Palmer amaranth. Here, we report a HPPD-inhibiting herbicide resistant wild radish population from the Western Australia grain belt. This population was not selected with HPPD-inhibiting herbicides, rather it evolved resistance to earlier used herbicides with different modes of action and exhibits cross-resistance to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides."
"31854080","abstracttext_results","Dose-response experiments showed the resistant (R) population exhibits 4 to 6.5-fold resistance to the HPPD-inhibiting herbicides mesotrione, tembotrione and isoxaflutole, compared to the susceptible (S) population. This resistance is not target-site based as cloning of full coding sequences of the HPPD genes from S and R plants did not reveal resistance-endowing single nucleotide polymorphisms. The HPPD gene expression levels are similar in S and R plants. In addition, no differences in [ 14 C]-mesotrione uptake and translocation were observed in the S and R plants. However, the time required for R plants to metabolise 50% [ 14 C]-mesotrione is 7.7-fold faster than for the S plants."

"31821969","abstracttext","This study describes the biocontrol potential of rhizobacteria against a range of fungal phytopathogens. Out of 227 bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of maize, rice, wheat, potato, sunflower and soybean crops cultivated in different agro-ecological regions of Pakistan, 48 exhibited >60 % antifungal activity against Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium moniliforme, Rhizoctonia solani, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Colletotrichum falcatum, Aspergillus niger, and Aspergillus flavus. The rhizobacteria inhibiting >65 % pathogen growth were selected for detailed molecular and in planta studies most of which were identified as Pseudomonas and Bacillus species based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Antifungal metabolites produced by these rhizobacteria analyzed through LCMS were identified as antibiotics (iturin, surfactins, fengycin, DAPG, Phenazine, etc.), cell wall degrading enzymes (protease, chitinase, and cellulase), plant growth promotion enzymes and hormones (indole-3-acetic acid, ACC-deaminase, phosphates, nitrogen fixation), N-acyl-homoserine lactones and siderophores. The growth room experiment validated the potential of these bacteria as biofertilizer and biopesticide agents. Of all, P. aeruginosa strain FB2 and B. subtilis strain RMB5 showed significantly higher potential as antagonistic plant-beneficial bacteria effective against a range of fungal phytopathogens. Both these bacteria can be used to develop a dual-purpose bacterial inoculum as biopesticide and biofertilizer. Rest of the antagonistic PGPR may be exploited for disease control in less-infested soils."
"31866983","articletitle","Inhibition of Rumen Protozoa by Specific Inhibitors of Lysozyme and Peptidases in vitro ."
"31866983","abstracttext","Defaunation studies have shown that rumen protozoa are one of the main causes of low nitrogen utilization efficiency due to their bacterivory and subsequent intraruminal cycling of microbial protein in ruminants. In genomic and transcriptomic studies, we found that rumen protozoa expressed lysozymes and peptidases at high levels. We hypothesized that specific inhibition of lysozyme and peptidases could reduce the activity and growth of rumen protozoa, which can decrease their predation of microbes and proteolysis and subsequent ammoniagenesis by rumen microbiota. To test the above hypothesis, we evaluated three specific inhibitors: imidazole (IMI), a lysozyme inhibitor; phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), a serine protease inhibitor; and iodoacetamide (IOD), a cysteine protease inhibitor; both individually and in combinations, with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) as a positive control. Rumen fluid was collected from two Jersey dairy cows fed either a concentrate-based dairy ration or only alfalfa hay. Each protozoa-enriched rumen fluid was incubated for 24 h with or without the aforementioned inhibitors and fed a mixture of ground wheat grain, alfalfa, and grass hays to support microbial growth. Live protozoa cells were morphologically identified and counted simultaneously at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h of incubation. Fermentation characteristics and prokaryotic composition were determined and compared at the end of the incubation. Except for IOD, all the inhibitors reduced all the nine protozoal genera identified, but to different extents, in a time-dependent manner. IOD was the least inhibitory to protozoa, but it lowered ammoniagenesis the most while not decreasing feed digestibility or concentration of volatile fatty acids (VFA). ANCOM analysis identified loss of Fibrobacter and overgrowth of Treponema , Streptococcus , and Succinivibrio in several inhibitor treatments. Functional prediction (from 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequences) using the CowPI database showed that the inhibitors decreased the relative abundance of the genes encoding amino acid metabolism, especially peptidases, and lysosome in the rumen microbiota. Overall, inhibition of protozoa resulted in alteration of prokaryotic microbiota and in vitro fermentation, and peptidases, especially cysteine-peptidase, may be targeted to improve nitrogen utilization in ruminants."

"31855502","abstracttext","Net form net blotch (NFNB), caused by the fungal pathogen Pyrenophora teres f. teres , is an important foliar disease present in all barley-producing regions of the world. This fungus is a hemibiotrophic and heterothallic ascomycete, where sexual recombination can lead to changes in disease expression in the host. Knowledge of the genetic architecture and genes involved in virulence is vital to increase the durability of NFNB resistance in barley cultivars. We used a genome-wide association mapping approach to characterize P. teres f. teres genomic regions associated with virulence in Australian barley cultivars. One hundred eighty-eight P. teres f. teres isolates collected across five Australian states were genotyped using Diversity Arrays Technology sequence markers and phenotyped across 20 different barley genotypes. Association mapping identified 14 different genomic regions associated with virulence, with the majority located on P. teres f. teres chromosomes 3 and 5 and one each present on chromosomes 1, 6, and 9. Four of the regions identified were confirmed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping. The QTL regions are discussed in the context of their genomic architecture together with examination of their gene contents, which identified 20 predicted effectors. The number of QTL shown in this study at the population level clearly illustrates a complex genetic basis of P. teres f. teres virulence compared with pure necrotrophs, such as the wheat pathogens Parastagonospora nodorum and Parastagonospora tritici-repentis ."

"31921053","abstracttext","Limited information on transcription factor (TF)-mediated regulation exists for most filamentous fungi, specifically for regulation of the production of plant-biomass-degrading enzymes (PBDEs). The filamentous fungus, Talaromyces pinophilus , can secrete integrative cellulolytic and amylolytic enzymes, suggesting a promising application in biotechnology. In the present study, the regulatory roles of a Zn2Cys6 protein, TP05746, were investigated in T. pinophilus through the use of biochemical, microbiological and omics techniques. Deletion of the gene TP05746 in T. pinophilus led to a 149.6% increase in soluble-starch-degrading enzyme (SSDE) production at day one of soluble starch induction but an approximately 30% decrease at days 2 to 4 compared with the parental strain Δ TpKu70 . In contrast, the T . pinophilus mutant Δ TP05746 exhibited a 136.8-240.0% increase in raw-starch-degrading enzyme (RSDE) production, as well as a 90.3 to 519.1% increase in cellulase and xylanase production following induction by culturing on wheat bran plus Avicel, relative to that exhibited by Δ TpKu70 . Additionally, the mutant Δ TP05746 exhibited accelerated mycelial growth at the early stage of cultivation and decreased conidiation. Transcriptomic profiling and real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) analyses revealed that TP05746 dynamically regulated the expression of genes encoding major PBDEs and their regulatory genes, as well as fungal development-regulated genes. Furthermore, in vitro binding experiments confirmed that TP05746 bound to the promoter regions of the genes described above. These results will contribute to our understanding of the regulatory mechanism of PBDE genes and provide a promising target for genetic engineering for improved PBDE production in filamentous fungi."
"31921252","articletitle","De Novo Transcriptome Analysis of Durum Wheat Flag Leaves Provides New Insights Into the Regulatory Response to Elevated CO 2 and High Temperature."
"31921252","abstracttext","Global warming is becoming a significant problem for food security, particularly in the Mediterranean basin. The use of molecular techniques to study gene-level responses to environmental changes in non-model organisms is increasing and may help to improve the mechanistic understanding of durum wheat response to elevated CO 2 and high temperature. With this purpose, we performed transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) analyses combined with physiological and biochemical studies in the flag leaf of plants grown in field chambers at ear emergence. Enhanced photosynthesis by elevated CO 2 was accompanied by an increase in biomass and starch and fructan content, and a decrease in N compounds, as chlorophyll, soluble proteins, and Rubisco content, in association with a decline of nitrate reductase and initial and total Rubisco activities. While high temperature led to a decline of chlorophyll, Rubisco activity, and protein content, the glucose content increased and starch decreased. Furthermore, elevated CO 2 induced several genes involved in mitochondrial electron transport, a few genes for photosynthesis and fructan synthesis, and most of the genes involved in secondary metabolism and gibberellin and jasmonate metabolism, whereas those related to light harvesting, N assimilation, and other hormone pathways were repressed. High temperature repressed genes for C, energy, N, lipid, secondary, and hormone metabolisms. Under the combined increases in atmospheric CO 2 and temperature, the transcript profile resembled that previously reported for high temperature, although elevated CO 2 partly alleviated the downregulation of primary and secondary metabolism genes. The results suggest that there was a reprogramming of primary and secondary metabolism under the future climatic scenario, leading to coordinated regulation of C-N metabolism towards C-rich metabolites at elevated CO 2 and a shift away from C-rich secondary metabolites at high temperature. Several candidate genes differentially expressed were identified, including protein kinases, receptor kinases, and transcription factors."

Six important kernel traits, kernel length (KL), kernel width (KW), kernel perimeter (KP), kernel area (KA), kernel length/width ratio (KLW), and thousand-kernel weight (TKW) were evaluated in Yangling, Shaanxi Province, China (2016 and 2017), Nanyang, Henan Province, China (2017) and Suqian, Jiangsu Province, China (2017). A genetic linkage map was constructed using 205 SSR markers, and a total of 21 significant QTLs for KL, KW, KP, KA, KLW and TKW were located on 10 of the 21 wheat chromosomes, including 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3D, 4D, 5A, 5B, and 7D, with a single QTL in different environments explaining 3.495-30.130% of the phenotypic variation. There were four loci for KLW, five for KA, five for KL, three for KP, two for KW, and two for TKW among the detected QTLs. We used BSA + 660 K gene chip technology to reveal the positions of major novel QTLs for KLW. A total of 670 out of 5285 polymorphic SNPs were detected on chromosome 2A. The SNPs in 2A are most likely related to the major QTL, and there may be minor QTLs on 5B, 7A, 3A and 4B. SSR markers were developed to verify the chromosome region associated with KLW. A linkage map was constructed with 7 SSR markers, and a major effect QTL was identified within a 21.55 cM interval, corresponding to a physical interval of 10.8 Mb in the Chinese Spring RefSeq v1.0 sequence.

"32065125","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 20- to 24-nucleotide (nt) endogenous small RNAs (sRNAs) extensively existing in plants and animals that play potent roles in regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Sequencing sRNA libraries by Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods has been widely employed to identify and analyze miRNA transcriptomes in the last decade, resulting in a rapid increase of miRNA discovery. However, two major challenges arise in plant miRNA annotation due to increasing depth of sequenced sRNA libraries as well as the size and complexity of plant genomes. First, many other types of sRNAs, in particular, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from sRNA libraries, are erroneously annotated as miRNAs by many computational tools. Second, it becomes an extremely time-consuming process for analyzing miRNA transcriptomes in plant species with large and complex genomes. To overcome these challenges, we recently upgraded miRDeep-P (a popular tool for miRNA transcriptome analyses) to miRDeep-P2 (miRDP2 for short) by employing a new filtering strategy, overhauling the scoring algorithm and incorporating newly updated plant miRNA annotation criteria. We tested miRDP2 against sequenced sRNA populations in five representative plants with increasing genomic complexity, including Arabidopsis, rice, tomato, maize and wheat. The results indicate that miRDP2 processed these tasks with very high efficiency. In addition, miRDP2 outperformed other prediction tools regarding sensitivity and accuracy. Taken together, our results demonstrate miRDP2 as a fast and accurate tool for analyzing plant miRNA transcriptomes, therefore a useful tool in helping the community better annotate miRNAs in plants."

Our objective was to identify miRNAs related to the regulation of grain characteristics and the response to different N fertilizer conditions."
"32103721","abstracttext_results","A total of 79 miRNAs (46 known and 33 novel miRNAs) were identified that showed significant differential expression during grain development under both high nitrogen (HN) and low nitrogen (LN) treatments. The miRNAs that were significantly upregulated early in grain development target genes involved mainly in cell differentiation, auxin-activated signaling, and transcription, which may be associated with grain size; miRNAs abundant in the middle and later stages target genes mainly involved in carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, transport, and kinase activity and may be associated with grain filling. Additionally, we identified 50 miRNAs (22 known and 28 novel miRNAs), of which 11, 9, and 39 were differentially expressed between the HN and LN libraries at 7, 17, and 27 days after anthesis (DAA). The miRNAs that were differentially expressed in response to nitrogen conditions target genes involved mainly in carbohydrate and nitrogen metabolism, the defense response, and transport as well as genes that encode ubiquitin ligase. Only one novel miRNA (PC-5p-2614_215) was significantly upregulated in response to LN treatment at all three stages, and 21 miRNAs showed significant differential expression between HN and LN conditions only at 27 DAA. We therefore propose a model for target gene regulation by miRNAs during grain development with N-responsive patterns."

"32106769","abstracttext","Stripe rust and leaf rust cause wheat yield losses of up to 70% worldwide. The employment of resistant cultivars is the major method to reduce losses from these diseases. The objective of this study was to detect quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stripe rust and leaf rust resistance in 150 F 6 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a cross between Mianyang351-15 and Zhengzhou 5389. Both parents and the RIL population were genotyped with the Wheat55K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and simple sequence repeat markers, and phenotyped for stripe rust severity at Mianyang in Sichuan Province and Baoding in Hebei Province, and for leaf rust severity at Zhoukou in Henan Province and at Baoding in 2014 to 2017 cropping seasons. Seven and four QTL all contributed from Mianyang351-15 were identified for resistance to stripe rust and leaf rust, respectively. Four of these QTL on chromosomes 1BL, 2AS, 2DS, and 7BL conferred resistance to both stripe rust and leaf rust. The QTL on 1BL, 2AS, and 7BL were identified as Lr46/Yr29 , Lr37/Yr17 , and Lr68 , respectively. QYr.hbau-2DS / QLr.hbau-2DS was detected at similar positions to previously reported loci. QYr.hbau-1DL , QYr.hbau-3AS , and QYr.hbau-3DL are likely to be new. Combined effects of QTL in the RIL population indicated RIL combining all QTL had the highest resistance level compared with those of lower numbers or no QTL.

"31246975","articletitle","A new microbial gluten-degrading prolyl endopeptidase: Potential application in celiac disease to reduce gluten immunogenic peptides."
"31246975","abstracttext","Gluten is a complex of proteins present in barley, wheat, rye and several varieties of oats that triggers celiac disease in genetically predisposed subjects. Gluten is notoriously difficult to digest by mammalian proteolytic enzymes and therefore, proline-rich digestion-resistant peptides contain multiple immunogenic epitopes. Prolyl endopeptidases (PEP) hydrolyse internal proline residues on the carboxyl side of peptides and have been proposed for food gluten detoxification and as oral enzyme supplementation for celiacs. The aim of this study was to identify new gluten-degrading microbial enzymes with the potential to reduce gluten immunogenicity by neutralizing its antigenic epitopes. Using a gluten-degrading colony screening approach, a bacterial isolate (2RA3) displaying the highest glutenase activity was selected, characterized and its genome completely sequenced. The identification through 16S rDNA gene sequencing showed a 99,1% similarity to Chryseobacterium taeanense. Hydrolysis of gluten immunogenic peptides (GIP) was further monitored, over a 48-hour period, by colony encapsulation in gliadin-containing microspheres, followed by detection with the G12 anti-GIP monoclonal antibody. Glutenase activity was detected in the extracellular medium of 2RA3 cultures, where gel electrophoresis and gliadin zymography revealed the presence of a ~50 kDa gluten-degrading enzyme. Nano-ESI-Q-TOF of the excised active band identified 7 peptides contained in the protein product predicted for an open reading frame (ORF) in the 2RA3 genome. Based on sequence similarity to the PEP family, the new enzyme was named PEP 2RA3. The PEP 2RA3 coding sequence was PCR-amplified from C. taeanense 2RA3, cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as a C-terminally His-tagged recombinant protein and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. The recombinant protein, with predicted molecular mass and isoelectric point of 78.95 kDa and 6.8, respectively, shows PEP activity with standard chromogenic substrates, works optimally at pH 8.0 and 30°C and remains stable at pH 6.0 and 50°C, indicating a potential use in gluten-containing food process applications. The ability of the recombinant enzyme to degrade GIP in beer into smaller peptides was confirmed."

"31240662","abstracttext","The effects of plant-based carbon source addition on wastewater NO 3 - -N removal and the involved microorganisms, especially denitrifying bacteria, were investigated. A synthetic wastewater (NO 3 - -N, 15 mg/L) was treated through the batch experiment, which included three inoculation cycles (7 days/cycle), and was conducted at 25 °C. Four natural plant substrates, namely, rice straw (RS), wheat straw (WS), ryegrass (RG), and reed (RD), were used as carbon sources and supplemented at the rate of 1% (w/v). The results showed that both RS and WS performed well in promoting NO 3 - -N removal (79.55-97.07%). While RG removed only 22.08% of NO 3 - -N in the first cycle, the removal efficiency increased afterward (86.09-95.82%). Conversely, the NO 3 - -N removal rate of RD decreased from 95.10 to 24.77% as a result of its low ability to supply carbon. With respect to the microorganisms, the RS treatment resulted in more bacteria and denitrifying genes such as narG, nirK, nirS, and norB than other treatments, while the highest number of nosZ gene copies was recorded in the WS treatment. Sequencing results revealed that Firmicutes (18.19-56.96%), Proteobacteria (38.82-74.80%), and Bacteroidetes (3.15-4.15%) were three dominant bacterial phyla for RS, WS, and RD treatments. Furthermore, the genera Enterobacter, Massilia, and Bacillus were the main denitrifying bacteria participating in the NO 3 - -N removal. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that the denitrifying genus Sphingobacterium played an important role in enhancing nitrogen removal. This study suggested that RS is the superior plant-based carbon source for denitrifying bioreactors used in agricultural runoff treatment."

"31379780","abstracttext","Clonostachys rosea is a biological control agent against Fusarium graminearum in small grain cereals and maize. Infections with F. graminearum do not only reduce the yield but, due to the production of mycotoxins, also affect the entire value chain of food and feed. In addition, production of other secondary metabolites such as hydrophobins, also known as gushing inducers, may cause quality challenges for the malting and brewing industry. Sustainable disease control strategies using C. rosea are treatment of infected residues of the previous crop, direct treatment of the actual cereal crop or post-harvest treatment during malting processes. Follow-up of growth and survival of biocontrol organisms during these different stages is of crucial importance. In the current study, we developed a quantitative real-time PCR detection method that amends the currently available culture-dependent techniques by using TaqMan chemistry with a highly specific primer and probe set, targeting the actin gene. We established a sensitive assay that detects the biological control agent down to 100 genome copies per reaction, with PCR efficiencies between 90 and 100%. The specificity of the assay was confirmed against a panel of 30 fungal and 3 bacterial species including 12 members of the Fusarium head blight complex and DNA of barley, maize and wheat. The DNA of C. rosea was detected in Fusarium -infected maize crop residues that were either treated in the laboratory or in the field with C. rosea and followed its DNA throughout the barley malting process to estimate its growth during grain germination. We used a standardized DNA extraction protocol and showed that C. rosea can be quantified in different sample matrices. This method will enable the monitoring of C. rosea during experiments studying the biological control of F. graminearum on cereal crop residues and on cereal grains and will thus contribute to the development of a new disease control strategy."

Previously documented pleiotropic resistance genes Yr18/Lr34 and Yr46 / Lr67 and tightly linked genes Yr17 - Lr37 and Yr30-Sr2 - Lr27 were also detected in this population. In addition, stripe rust resistance QTL Yrswp-2B.1 , Yrswp-3B , and Yrswp-7B colocated with leaf rust resistance loci 2B_3 , 3B_t2 , and 7B_4 , respectively. Haplotype analysis uncovered that Yrswp-3B and 3B_t2 were either tightly linked genes or the same gene for resistance to both stripe and leaf rusts. Single nucleotide polymorphism markers IWB35950 , IWB74350 , and IWB72134 for the 3B QTL conferring resistance to both rusts should be useful in incorporating the resistance allele(s) in new cultivars."
"31250025","articletitle","The influence of dietary leucine above recommendations and fixed ratios to isoleucine and valine on muscle protein synthesis and degradation pathways in broilers."
"31250025","abstracttext","This study investigated the hypothesis that dietary supplementation of leucine (Leu) above actual recommendations activates protein synthesis and inhibits protein degradation pathways on the molecular level and supports higher muscle growth in broilers. Day-old male Cobb-500 broilers (n = 180) were allotted to 3 groups and phase-fed 3 different corn-wheat-soybean meal-based basal diets during periods 1 to 10, 11 to 21, and 22 to 35 D. The control group (L0) received the basal diet which met the broiler's requirements of nutrients and amino acids for maintenance and growth. Groups L1 and L2 received basal diets supplemented with Leu to exceed recommendations by 35 and 60%, respectively, and isoleucine (Ile) and valine (Val) were supplemented to keep Leu: Ile and Leu: Val ratios fixed. Samples of liver and breast muscle and pancreas were collected on days 10, 21, and 35. The gene expression and abundance of total and phosphorylated proteins involved in the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway of protein synthesis, in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and autophagy-lysosomal pathway of protein degradation, in the general control nonderepressible 2/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2A pathway involved in the inhibition of protein synthesis, and in the myostatin-Smad2/3 pathway involved in myogenesis were evaluated in the muscle, as well as expression of genes involved in the growth hormone axis. Growth performance, feed intake, the feed conversion ratio, and carcass weights did not differ between the 3 groups (P > 0.05). Plasma concentrations of Leu, Ile, and Val and of their keto acids, and the activity of the branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase in the pancreas increased dose dependently with increasing dietary Leu concentrations. In the breast muscle, relative mRNA abundances of genes and phosphorylation of selected proteins involved in all investigated pathways were largely uninfluenced by dietary Leu supplementation (P > 0.05). In summary, these data indicate that excess dietary Leu concentrations do not influence protein synthesis or degradation pathways, and subsequently do not increase muscle growth in broilers at fixed ratios to Ile and Val."
"31431550","articletitle","Metabolomics Analysis Identifies Sphingolipids as Key Signaling Moieties in Appressorium Morphogenesis and Function in Magnaporthe oryzae."
"31431550","abstracttext","The blast fungus initiates infection using a heavily melanized, dome-shaped infection structure known as the appressorium, which forcibly ruptures the cuticle to enter the rice leaf tissue. How this process takes place remains not fully understood. Here, we used untargeted metabolomics analyses to profile the metabolome of developing appressoria and identified significant changes in six key metabolic pathways, including early sphingolipid biosynthesis. Analyses employing small molecule inhibitors, gene disruption, or genetic and chemical complementation demonstrated that ceramide compounds of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway are essential for normal appressorial development controlled by mitosis. In addition, ceramide was found to act upstream from the protein kinase C-mediated cell wall integrity pathway during appressorium repolarization and pathogenicity in rice blast. Further discovery of the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway revealed that glucosylceramide (GlcCer) synthesized by ceramide is the key substance affecting the pathogenicity of Magnaporthe oryzae Our results provide new insights into the chemical moieties involved in the infection-related signaling networks, thereby revealing a potential target for the development of novel control agents against the major disease of rice and other cereals. IMPORTANCE Our untargeted analysis of metabolomics throughout the course of pathogenic development gave us an unprecedented high-resolution view of major shifts in metabolism that occur in the topmost fungal pathogen that infects rice, wheat, barley, and millet. Guided by these metabolic insights, we demonstrated their practical application by using two different small-molecule inhibitors of sphingolipid biosynthesis enzymes to successfully block the pathogenicity of M. oryzae Our study thus defines the sphingolipid biosynthesis pathway as a key step and potential target that can be exploited for the development of antifungal agents. Furthermore, future investigations that exploit such important metabolic intermediates will further deepen our basic understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of fungal blast disease in important cereal crops."

"31483225","abstracttext","Poa semilatent virus (PSLV), Lychnis ringspot virus (LRSV), and Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) are members of the genus Hordeivirus in the family Virgaviridae . However, the biological properties and molecular genetics of PSLV have not been compared with other hordeiviruses. Here, we have constructed an infectious cDNA clone of the PSLV Canadian strain and provided evidence that PSLV differs from BSMV and LRSV. First, unlike the other two hordeiviruses that replicate in chloroplasts, PSLV induces dramatic structural changes in peroxisome during its infection in barley. The αa replication protein also localizes to peroxisomes, suggesting that PSLV replication occurs in peroxisomes. Second, PSLV encodes a γb protein that shares 19 to 23% identity with those of other hordeiviruses, and its activity as a viral suppressor of RNA (VSR) silencing is distinct from those of BSMV and LRSV. Substitution of the BSMV γb protein with that of PSLV or LRSV revealed a negative correlation between VSR activity and symptom severity of the recombinant BSMV derivatives. Intriguingly, the Ser-Lys-Leu (SKL) peroxisome-targeting signals differ among γb proteins of various hordeiviruses, including some BSMV strains. The presence of the C-terminal SKL motif in the γb protein impairs its silencing suppressor activity and influences symptoms. Finally, we developed a PSLV-based virus-induced gene silencing vector that induced strong and effective silencing phenotypes of endogenous genes in barley, wheat, and millet. Our results shed new light on hordeivirus pathogenesis and evolution, and provide an alternative tool for genomics studies of model hosts and economically important monocots."

"31605748","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum responds to environmental cues to modulate its growth and metabolism during wheat pathogenesis. Nitrogen limitation activates virulence-associated behaviours in F. graminearum including mycotoxin production and penetrative growth. In other filamentous fungi, nitrogen sensing is mediated by both the Target of Rapamycin (TOR) and the glutamine synthetase (GS)-dependent signaling pathways. While TOR-dependent nitrogen responses have been demonstrated in F. graminearum, the involvement of GS remains unclear. Our study indicates that both the TOR and GS signalling pathways are involved in nitrogen sensing in F. graminearum and contribute to glutamine-induced mycelial growth. However, neither pathway is required for glutamine-induced repression of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) indicating that an additional nitrogen sensing pathway must exist. Further, two genes FgBMH1 and FgBMH2 encoding 14-3-3 proteins regulate nitrogen responses with effects on gene expression, DON production and mycelial growth. Unlike yeast, where 14-3-3s function redundantly in regulating nitrogen sensing, the 14-3-3 proteins have differing functions in F. graminearum. While both FgBMH1 and FgBMH2 regulate early glutamine-induced DON repression, only FgBMH2 is involved in regulating reproduction, virulence and glutamine-induced AreA repression. Together, our findings help to clarify the nitrogen sensing pathways in F. graminearum and highlight the involvement of 14-3-3s in the nitrogen response of filamentous fungi."

In this study, 179 bacterial strains were isolated by using nitrogen-free medium after heating at 85 °C for 10 min from 69 soil samples collected from different plant rhizospheres in different areas. Of the 179 bacterial strains, 25 Paenibacillus strains had nifH gene encoding Fe protein of nitrogenase and showed nitrogenase activities. Of the 25 N 2 -fixing Paenibacillus strains, 22 strains produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). 21 strains out of the 25 N 2 -fixing Paenibacillus strains inhibited at least one of the 6 plant pathogens Rhizoctonia cerealis , Fusarium graminearum , Gibberella zeae , Fusarium solani , Colletotrichum gossypii and Alternaria longipes . 18 strains inhibited 5 plant pathogens and Paenibacillus sp. SZ-13b could inhibit the growth of all of the 6 plant pathogens. According to the nitrogenase activities, antibacterial capacities and IAA production, we chose eight strains to inoculate wheat, cucumber and tomato. Our results showed that the 5 strains Paenibacillus sp. JS-4, Paenibacillus sp. SZ-10, Paenibacillus sp. SZ-14, Paenibacillus sp. BJ-4 and Paenibacillus sp.

"31526457","abstracttext","Strain TE3 T , an endophytic plant growth promoting bacterium, was isolated from wheat ( Triticumturgidum subsp. durum ) sampled in the Yaqui Valley, Mexico. Biochemical, phenotypic and genotypic approaches were used to clarify the taxonomic affiliation of this strain. Based on analysis of its full-length 16S rRNA gene, strain TE3 T was assigned to the genus Bacillus (similarity ≥98.7 %). This finding was supported by morphological and metabolic characteristics, such as rod shape, strictly aerobic metabolism, spore formation, Gram-positive staining, catalase-positive activity, reduction of nitrate to nitrite, starch and casein hydrolysis, growth in presence of lysozyme and 2 % NaCl, citrate utilization, growth pH from 6.0 to 8.0, and acid and indole production from glucose and tryptophan, respectively. The whole-genome phylogenetic relationship showed that TE3 T formed an individual clade with Bacillus tequilensis KCTC 13622 T , distant from that generated by all Bacillus subtilis subspecies. The maximum values for average nucleotide identity and in silico DNA-DNA hybridization were 93.85 and 54.30 %, respectively, related to Bacillus subtilis subsp. inaquosorum KCTC 13429 T . Analysis of its fatty acid content showed the ability of strain TE3 T to bio-synthetize fatty acids that are not present in closely related Bacillus species, such as C 12 : 0 , C 12 : 0 2OH, C 12 : 0 3OH, C 17 : 0 , iso-C 17 : 0 3OH and C 18 : 1 ω9 c .

"31298518","abstracttext","Avenin-like b protein is rich in cysteine residues, providing the possibility to form intermolecular disulfide bonds and then participate in glutenin polymerization. Site-directed mutagenesis was adopted to produce mutant avenin-like b gene encoding mutant avenin-like b protein, in which one tyrosine codon at the C-terminal is substituted by a cysteine codon. Compared with the control lines, both transgenic lines with wild-type and mutant avenin-like b genes demonstrated superior dough properties. While compared within the transgenic lines, the mutant lines showed relative weaker dough strength and decreased sodium-dodecyl-sulfate sedimentation volumes (from 69.7 mL in line WT alb-1 to 41.0 mL in line Mut alb-4). These inferior dough properties were accompanied by the lower contents of large-sized glutenin polymers, the decreased particle diameters of glutenin macropolymer (GMP), due to the lower content of intermolecular β-sheets (from 39.48% for line WT alb-2 to 30.21% for line Mut alb-3) and the varied contents of disulfide bonds (from 137.37 μmol/g for line WT alb-1 to 105.49 μmol/g for line Mut alb-4) in wheat dough. The extra cysteine might alter the original disulfide bond structure, allowing cysteine residue usually involved in an intermolecular disulfide bond to become available for an intrachain disulfide bond. Avenin-like b proteins were detected in glutenin macropolymers, providing further evidence for this protein to participate in the polymerization of glutenin. This is the first time to investigate the effect of a specific cysteine residue in the avenin-like b protein on flour quality."

A total of 40 endophytic bacteria from cultivated and wild sp. of soybean were screened for multifarious PGP traits and pathogenicity test. Based on PGP traits, antagonistic activities and bio-safety test; L. adecarboxylata (LSE-1) was identified with 16 S rRNA gene sequencing along with the presence of nifH (nitrogen fixation) and ipdc (IAA production) genes. Dual inoculant LSE-1 and LSBR-3 increased indole acetic acid (IAA), P & Zn-solubilization, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD) activity, siderophore, biofilm formation and exo-polysaccharides in contrast to single inoculation treatment. Further, assessment of dual inoculant LSBR-3 + LSE-1 improved growth parameters, nodulation, soil enzymes activities, nutrient accumulation and yield as compared to single as well as un-inoculated control treatment under field conditions. Single inoculant LSBR-3 improved yield by 8.84% over control. Further, enhancement of 4.15% grain yield was noticed with LSBR-3 + LSE-1 over LSBR-3 alone treatment. Application of LSBR-3 + LSE-1 gave superior B:C ratio (1.29) and additional income approximately 116 USD ha -1 in contrast to control treatment.

"32982076","abstracttext","Potentially toxic metals (PTEs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) present in bio-wastes were the major environmental and health risks for soil use. If pyrolyzing bio-wastes into biochar could minimize such risks had not been elucidated. This study evaluated PTE pools, microbial and ARGs abundances of wheat straw (WS), swine manure (SM) and sewage sludge (SS) before and after pyrolysis, which were again tested for soil amendment at a 2% dosage in a pot experiment with a vegetable crop of pak choi ( Brassica campestris L.). Pyrolysis led to PTEs concentration in biochars but reduced greatly their mobility, availability and migration potential, as revealed respectively by leaching, CaCl 2 extraction and risk assessment coding. In SM and SS after pyrolysis, gene abundance was removed by 4-5 orders for bacterial, by 2-3 orders for fungi and by 3-5 orders for total ARGs. With these material amended, PTEs available pool decreased by 25%-85% while all ARGs eliminated to background in the pot soil. Unlike a >50% yield decrease and a >30% quality decline with unpyrolyzed SM and SS, their biochars significantly increased biomass production and overall quality of pak choi grown in the amended soil. Comparatively, amendment of the biochars decreased plant PTEs content by 23-57% and greatly reduced health risk of pak choi, with total target hazard quotient values well below the guideline limit for subsistence diet by adult. Furthermore, biochar soil amendment enabled a synergic improvement on soil fertility, product quality, and biomass production as well as metal stabilization in the soil-plant system. Thus, biowastes pyrolysis and reuse in vegetable production could help build up a closed loop of production-waste-biochar-production, addressing not only circular economy but healthy food and climate nexus also and contributing to achieving the United Nations sustainable development goals."

"32903855","abstracttext","Potato ( Solanum tuberosum L.) is the worldwide most important nongrain crop after wheat, rice, and maize. The autotetraploidy of the modern commercial potato makes breeding of new resistant and high-yielding cultivars challenging due to complicated and time-consuming identification and selection processes of desired crop features. On the other hand, plant protection of existing cultivars using conventional synthetic pesticides is increasingly restricted due to safety issues for both consumers and the environment. Chitosan is known to display antimicrobial activity against a broad range of plant pathogens and shows the ability to trigger resistance in plants by elicitation of defense responses. As chitosan is a renewable, biodegradable and nontoxic compound, it is considered as a promising next-generation plant-protecting agent. However, the molecular and cellular modes of action of chitosan treatment are not yet understood. In this study, transcriptional changes in chitosan-treated potato leaves were investigated via RNA sequencing. Leaves treated with a well-defined chitosan polymer at low concentration were harvested 2 and 5 h after treatment and their expression profile was compared against water-treated control plants. We observed 32 differentially expressed genes (fold change ≥ 1; p-value ≤ 0.05) 2 h after treatment and 83 differentially expressed genes 5 h after treatment. Enrichment analysis mainly revealed gene modulation associated with electron transfer chains in chloroplasts and mitochondria, accompanied by the upregulation of only a very limited number of genes directly related to defense. As chitosan positively influences plant growth, yield, and resistance, we conclude that activation of electron transfer might result in the crosstalk of different organelles via redox signals to activate immune responses in preparation for pathogen attack, concomitantly resulting in a generally improved metabolic state, fostering plant growth and development. This conclusion is supported by the rapid and transient production of reactive oxygen species in a typical oxidative burst in the potato leaves upon chitosan treatment. This study furthers our knowledge on the mode of action of chitosan as a plant-protecting agent, as a prerequisite for improving its ability to replace or reduce the use of less environmentally friendly agro-chemicals."

"33005223","abstracttext","Biological control is a promising approach to reduce plant diseases caused by nematodes to ensure high productivity in agricultural production. Large-scale analyses of genetic variation in fungal species used for biocontrol can generate knowledge regarding interaction mechanisms that can improve efficacy of biocontrol applications. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for in vitro antagonism against the root lesion nematode Pratylenchus penetrans in 53 previously genome re-sequenced strains of the biocontrol fungus Clonostachys rosea . Nematode mortality in C. rosea potato dextrose broth (PDB) culture filtrates was highly variable and showed continuous variation ( p  < .001) between strains, indicating a polygenic inheritance. Twenty-one strains produced culture filtrates with higher ( p  ≤ .05) nematode mortality compared with the PDB control treatment, while ten strains lowered ( p  ≤ .05) the mortality. The difference in in vitro antagonism against P. penetrans correlated with antagonism against the soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines , indicating lack of host specificity in C. rosea . An empirical Bayesian multiple hypothesis testing approach identified 279 single nucleotide polymorphism markers significantly (local false sign rate < 10 -10 ) associated with the trait. Genes present in the genomic regions associated with nematicidal activity included several membrane transporters, a chitinase and genes encoding proteins predicted to biosynthesize secondary metabolites. Gene deletion strains of the predicted nonribosomal peptide synthetase genes nps4 and nps5 were generated and showed increased ( p  ≤ .001) fungal growth and conidiation rates compared to the wild type. Deletion strains also exhibited reduced ( p  < .001) nematicidal activity and reduced ( p  ≤ .05) biocontrol efficacy against nematode root disease and against fusarium foot rot on wheat. In summary, we show that the GWAS approach can be used to identify biocontrol factors in C. rosea , specifically the putative nonribosomal peptide synthetases NPS4 and NPS5."

"33142680","abstracttext","At a global scale, about three billion people have inadequate zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) nutrition and 500,000 children lose their lives due to this. In recent years, the interest in adopting healthy diets drew increased attention to mineral nutrients, including Zn. Zn is an essential micronutrient for plant growth and development that is involved in several processes, like acting as a cofactor for hundreds of enzymes, chlorophyll biosynthesis, gene expression, signal transduction, and plant defense systems. Many agricultural soils are unable to supply the Zn needs of crop plants, making Zn deficiency a widespread nutritional disorder, particularly in calcareous (pH > 7) soils worldwide. Plant Zn efficiency involves Zn uptake, transport, and utilization; plants with high Zn efficiency display high yield and significant growth under low Zn supply and offer a promising and sustainable solution for the production of many crops, such as rice, beans, wheat, soybeans, and maize. The goal of this review is to report the current knowledge on key Zn efficiency traits including root system uptake, Zn transporters, and shoot Zn utilization. These mechanisms will be valuable for increasing the Zn efficiency of crops and food Zn contents to meet global needs for food production and nutrition in the 21st century. Furthermore, future research will address the target genes underlying Zn efficiency and the optimization of Zn efficiency phenotyping for the development of Zn-efficient crop varieties for more sustainable crop production under suboptimal Zn regimes, as well food security of the future."

"32849361","abstracttext","Rab GTPases play an important role in vesicle-mediated membrane trafficking in eukaryotes. Previous studies have demonstrated that deletion of RAB5 / VPS21 reduces endocytosis and virulence of fungal phytopathogens in their host plants. However, Rab5 GTPase cycle regulators have not been characterized in Fusarium graminearum , the causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) or head scab disease in cereal crops. In this study, we have identified and characterized a Rab5 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), the Vps9 homolog FgVps9, in F. graminearum . Yeast two hybrid (Y2H) assays have shown that FgVps9 specifically interacts with the guanosine diphosphate (GDP)-bound (inactive) forms of FgRab51 and FgRab52, the Rab5 isoforms in F. graminearum . Deletion of FgVPS9 shows impaired fungal growth and conidiation. Pathogenicity assays indicate that deletion of FgVPS9 can significantly decrease the virulence of F. graminearum in wheat. Cytological analyses have indicated that FgVps9 colocalizes with FgRab51 and FgRab52 on early endosomes and regulates endocytosis and autophagy processes. Gene expression and cytological examination have shown that FgVps9 and FgRab51 or FgRab52 function in concert to control deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis by regulating the expression of trichothecene biosynthesis-related genes and toxisome biogenesis. Taken together, FgVps9 functions as a GEF for FgRab51 and FgRab52 to regulate endocytosis, which, as a basic cellular function, has significant impact on the vegetative growth, asexual development, autophagy, DON production, and plant infection in F. graminearum ."

"32853651","abstracttext","Pregabalin (PGB) drug abuse is common among the youth. It substituted tramadol before its recent schedule as a controlled drug since April 2019. PGB is an antiepileptic drug acting on the central nervous system. It blocks calcium channels regulating the action of neurotransmitters and causing prolonged depolarization. The present study aimed to investigate the toxic effect of long term pregabalin abuse on the reproductive function and body weight in both male and female albino rats and to evaluate the ameliorative effect of wheat germ oil (WGO). Forty-eight rats were randomly divided into eight groups. The first four groups were males and they were treated as follows: control group (1.5 mL saline), WGO group (1.5 mL L/kg), PGB group (300 mg/kg), and protective group (PGB + WGO). All doses were administrated once per day for 60 days by gastric gavage. The second four groups were females. They were divided and treated the same as the male groups. Pregabalin caused significant weight loss, decreased serum triglyceride level, and increased leptin gene expression in all rats. PGB affected male rats reproduction by decreasing total testosterone serum level and inhibiting spermatogenesis. Reproductive toxicity in females was caused by decreasing pituitary steroids, increasing gonadal hormones, and increasing the number of atretic ovarian follicles. Mechanism of toxicity may be attributed to the PGB oxidative stress effect that induced apoptosis and caused diffuse gonadal atrophy. WGO showed a protective effect on PGB induced toxicity as all measured parameters were relatively improved."

"33114292","abstracttext","Drought induces several challenges for plant development, growth, and production. These challenges become more severe, in particular, in arid and semiarid countries like Egypt. In terms of production, barley ranks fourth after wheat, maize, and rice. Seed germination and seedling stages are critical stages for plant establishment and growth. In the current study, 60 diverse barley genotypes were tested for drought tolerance using two different treatments: control (0-PEG) and drought (20%-PEG). Twenty-two traits were estimated for seed germination and seedling parameters. All traits were reduced under drought stress, and a significant variation was found among genotypes under control and stress conditions. The broad-sense heritability estimates were very high under both control and drought for all traits. It ranged from 0.63 to 0.97 under the control condition and from 0.89 to 0.97 under drought, respectively. These high heritabilities suggested that genetic improvement of drought tolerance in barley at both stages is feasible. The principal component analysis revealed that root-related parameters account for the largest portion of phenotypic variation in this collection. The single-marker analysis (SMA) resulted in 71 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) distributed across the seven chromosomes of barley. Thirty-three QTLs were detected for root-length-related traits. Many hotspots of QTLs were detected for various traits. Interestingly, some markers controlled many traits in a pleiotropic manner; thus, they can be used to control multiple traits at a time. Some QTLs were constitutive, i.e., they are mapped under control and drought, and targeting these QTLs makes the selection for drought tolerance a single-step process. The results of gene annotation analysis revealed very potential candidate genes that can be targeted to select for drought tolerance."

Using in planta transcriptomic data from Z. tritici, we suggest different roles for the shared orthologs and for the accessory genes during infection of their hosts."
"32842972","abstracttext_conclusion","Despite previous reports of high genomic plasticity in Z. tritici, we describe here a high level of conservation in genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic composition and structure across the genus Zymoseptoria. The compartmentalized genome allows the maintenance of a functional core genome co-occurring with a highly variable accessory genome."

"32847024","abstracttext","The inclusion of pulses in traditional wheat-based food products is increasing as the food industry and consumers are recognizing the nutritional benefits due to the high protein, antioxidant activity, and good source of dietary fiber of pulses. Iron deficiency is a significant global health challenge, affecting approximately 30% of the world's population. Dietary iron deficiency is the foremost cause of anemia, a condition that harms cognitive development and increases maternal and infant mortality. This study intended to demonstrate the potential efficacy of low-phytate biofortified pea varieties on dietary iron (Fe) bioavailability, as well as on intestinal microbiome, energetic status, and brush border membrane (BBM) functionality in vivo ( Gallus gallus ). We hypothesized that the low-phytate biofortified peas would significantly improve Fe bioavailability, BBM functionality, and the prevalence of beneficial bacterial populations. A six-week efficacy feeding ( n = 12) was conducted to compare four low-phytate biofortified pea diets with control pea diet (CDC Bronco), as well as a no-pea diet. During the feeding trial, hemoglobin (Hb), body-Hb Fe, feed intake, and body weight were monitored. Upon the completion of the study, hepatic Fe and ferritin, pectoral glycogen, duodenal gene expression, and cecum bacterial population analyses were conducted. The results indicated that certain low-phytate pea varieties provided greater Fe bioavailability and moderately improved Fe status, while they also had significant effects on gut microbiota and duodenal brush border membrane functionality. Our findings provide further evidence that the low-phytate pea varieties appear to improve Fe physiological status and gut microbiota in vivo, and they highlight the likelihood that this strategy can further improve the efficacy and safety of the crop biofortification and mineral bioavailability approach."
"32689090","articletitle","Viewpoint: Evolution of cultivated chickpea: four bottlenecks limit diversity and constrain adaptation."
"32689090","abstracttext","Chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.) is characterised by a different adaptation profile from the other crops of West Asian origin such as pea, barley, and wheat. In this paper we suggest that a series of four evolutionary bottlenecks occur in chickpea: (1) the scarcity and limited distribution of the wild progenitor, C. reticulatum Ladiz., (2) the founder effect associated with domestication, (3) the shift, early in the crop's history, from winter to spring sowing, and the attendant change from using rainfall as it occurs to a reliance on residual soil moisture, and (4) the replacement of locally evolving landraces by elite cultivars produced by modern plant breeding. While two of the bottlenecks are common to all species, the limited distribution of the wild progenitor and shift of cropping from utilisation of current rainfall to stored soil moisture is unique to chickpea. In this paper we suggest that in order to widen the genetic base of cultivated chickpea it is imperative to reintroduce traits from across the primary gene pool. Moreover, a comparative physiological approach to the study of adaptation among the annual wild relatives of chickpea may reveal adaptive strategies within the genus currently obscured by monomorphic loci. The poor state of the world collection of annual wild Cicer species severely constrains the implementation of both these imperatives. We suggest that an extensive collection of annual wild Cicer species, based on ecogeographic principles to maximise the probability of collecting diverse ecotypes, should provide a better understanding of the biology and adaptation in this ancient crop and lead to improved productivity."
"33175843","articletitle","A haplotype-phased genome of wheat stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, race PST-130 from the Western USA."
"33175843","abstracttext","More virulent and aggressive races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the pathogen causing wheat stripe rust, have been spreading around the world since 2000 causing large grain yield losses. A better understanding of the genome and genetic diversity of these new Pst races will be useful to develop new strategies to ameliorate these losses. In this study, we generated an improved genome assembly of a post-2000 virulent race from the Western USA designated as PST-130. We implemented a haplotype phasing strategy using the diploid-aware assembler, Falcon-Unzip and new long-read technology from PacBio to phase the two genomes of this dikaryotic organism. The combination of these new technologies resulted in an improved PST-130 assembly with only 151 contigs (85.4 Mb, N50 of 1.44 Mb), and a complementary assembly (haplotigs) with 458 contigs (65.9 Mb, N50 of 0.235 Mb, PRJNA650506). This new assembly improved gene predictions resulting in 228 more predicted complete genes than in the initial Illumina assembly (29,178 contigs, N50 of 5 kb). The alignment of the non-repetitive primary and haplotig contigs revealed and average of 5.22 SNP/kb, with 39.1% showing <2 SNP/kb and 15.9% >10 SNP/kb. This large divergent regions may represent introgressions of chromosome segments from more divergent Pst races in regions where a complete sexual cycle and recombination are possible. We hypothesize that some of the divergent regions in PST-130 may be related to the European ""Warrior"" race PST-DK0911 because this genome is more similar to PST-130 (3.18 SNP/kb) than to the older European race PST-104E (3.75 SNP/kb). Complete phasing of additional Pst genomes or sequencing individual nuclei will facilitate the tracing of the haploid genomes introduced by the new Pst races into local populations."
"33262997","articletitle","Beyond the HLA Genes in Gluten-Related Disorders."
"33262997","abstracttext","Most common food grains contain gluten proteins and can cause adverse medical conditions generally known as gluten-related disorders. Celiac disease is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by gluten in individuals carrying a specific genetic make-up. The presence of the human leukocyte antigens (HLA)-DQ2 and HLA-DQ8 haplotypes together with gluten intake is a necessary, although not sufficient, condition, to develop celiac disease. Fine mapping of the human genome has revealed numerous genetic variants important in the development of this disease. Most of the genetic variants are small nucleotide polymorphisms located within promoters and transcriptional enhancer sequences. Their importance is underlined by an increased risk in DQ2/DQ8 carriers who also have these non-HLA alleles. In addition, several immune-mediated diseases share susceptibility loci with celiac disease, shedding light on the reasons for co-occurrence between these diseases. Finally, most of the genes potentially involved in celiac disease by fine genetic mapping of non-HLA loci were confirmed in gene expression studies. In contrast to celiac disease, very little is known about the genetic make-up of non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS), a clinically defined pathology that shares symptoms and gluten dependence with the celiac disease. We recently identified differentially expressed genes and miRNAs in the intestinal mucosa of these patients. Remarkably, the differentially expressed genes were long non-coding RNAs possibly involved in the regulation of cell functions. Thus, we can speculate that important aspects of these diseases depend on alteration of regulatory genetic circuits. Furthermore, our finding suggests that innate immune response is involved in the pathogenic mechanism of NCWS. This review is intended to convey the idea that in order to fully understand celiac disease and its relationship with other gluten-related disorders, it is worth learning more about non-HLA variants."
"33198292","articletitle","Sensitivity to Dietary Wheat Gluten in Atlantic Salmon Indicated by Gene Expression Changes in Liver and Intestine."
"33198292","abstracttext","Feed safety is a necessity for animal health and welfare as well as prerequisite for food safety and human health. Wheat gluten (WG) is considered as a valuable protein source in fish feed due to its suitability as a feed binder, high digestibility, good amino acid profile, energy density and most importantly, due to its relatively low level of anti-nutritional factors (ANFs). The main aim of this study was to identify the impact of dietary WG on salmon health by analysing growth, feed efficiency and the hepatic and intestinal transcriptomes. The fish were fed either control diet with fishmeal (FM) as the only source of protein or diets, where 15% or 30% of the FM were replaced by WG. The fish had a mean initial weight of 223 g and approximately doubled their weight during the 9-week experiment. Salmon fed on 30% WG showed reduced feed intake compared to the 15% and FM fed groups. The liver was the less affected organ but fat content and activities of the liver health markers in plasma increased with the inclusion level of WG in the diet. Gene expression analysis showed significant changes in both, intestine and liver of fish fed with 30% WG. Especially noticeable were changes in the lipid metabolism, in particular in relation to the intestinal lipoprotein transport and sterol metabolism. Moreover, the intestinal transcriptome of WG-fed fish showed shifts in the expression of a large number of genes responsible for immunity and tissue structure and integrity. These observations implied that the fish receiving WG-containing diet were undergoing nutritional stress. Overall, the study provided evidence that a high dietary level of WG can have a negative impact on the intestinal and liver health of salmon with symptoms similar to gluten sensitivity in humans."
"33202556","articletitle","Comparative Effects of Flaxseed Sources on the Egg ALA Deposition and Hepatic Gene Expression in Hy-Line Brown Hens."
"33202556","abstracttext","Healthy diets are necessary for both humans and animals, including poultry. These diets contain various nutrients for maintenance and production in laying hens. Therefore, research was undertaken to explore the efficiency of various dietary flaxseed sources on the n-3 deposition in the egg yolk and gene expression in laying hens. Five dietary groups were analyzed, i.e., (i) a corn-based diet with no flaxseed (FS) as a negative control (NC), (ii) a wheat-based diet supplemented with 10% whole FS without multi-carbohydrase enzymes (MCE) as a positive control (PC), (iii) ground FS supplemented with MCE (FS), (iv) extruded flaxseed meal was supplemented with MCE (EFM), (v) flaxseed oil supplemented with MCE (FSO). Results indicated that egg weight was highest in the NC, FS, EFM, and FSO groups as compared to PC in the 12th week. Egg mass was higher in enzyme supplemented groups as compared to the PC group, but lower than NC. In the 12th week, the HDEP (hen day egg production) was highest in the FS and EFM groups as compared to FSO, PC, and NC. The FCR (feed conversion ratio) was better in enzyme supplemented groups as compared to the PC group. Enzyme addition enhanced the egg quality as compared to PC in the 12th week. The HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) was increased, while LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), VLDL-C (very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), TC (total cholesterol), and TG (total triglycerides) were reduced in the enzyme supplemented groups as compared to PC and NC. The FSO deposit more n-3 PUFA and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the egg yolk as compared to FS and EFM groups. The expression of ACOX1 , LCPT1 , FADS1 , FADS2 , and ELOV2 genes were upregulated, while PPAR-α was downregulated in the FSO group. The LPL mRNA expression was upregulated in the FS, EFM, and FSO groups as compared to the PC and NC groups. It was inferred that FSO with enzymes at 2.5% is cost-effective, improves the hen performances, upregulated the fatty acid metabolism and β-oxidation genes expression, and efficiently deposits optimal n-3 PUFA in the egg as per consumer's demand."
"30727423","articletitle","First Report of Peanut Cylindrocladium Black Rot Caused by Cylindrocladium parasiticum in Fujian Province, Eastern China."
"30727423","abstracttext","During late July and early August of 2010, a serious disease of peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) resembling Cylindrocladium black rot (CBR) was found in Longyan City, Fujian Province of Eastern China. Aboveground symptoms were chlorosis and yellowing of leaves, a black rot of the basal stem and pegs, and wilting of the vines. Underground plant parts (including pods, pegs, taproots, and hypocotyls) were blackened and rotted. Orange-to-reddish spherical fruiting bodies appeared on the lesions of the basal stems and pegs of peanut. Disease incidence was approximately 20%. A fungus was consistently isolated from the edge of lesions on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with streptomycin and incubated at 25°C. The fungus produced white-to-pale buff mycelia with a yellowish brown pigment. Optimum growth of the fungus on PDA was at 25 to 30°C. Conidiophores were borne laterally on a stipe that terminated in a hyaline, globose vesicle measuring 5.5 × 10.9 μm in diameter. Conidia were hyaline, cylindrical, rounded at both ends, slightly wider at the base than at the apex, with one to three septa (mostly one septa), and measured 27.3 to 70.9 × 4.1 to 8.2 μm. Orange-to-reddish perithecia were readily formed in old cultures. The perithecia were subglobose to oval or obovate and measured 215.6 to 609.4 × 309.4 to 496.9 μm. The asci were hyaline, clavate, thin walled, long stalked, with each containing eight ascospores. Ascospores were hyaline, falcate, had one septum, and measured 27.3 to 54.5 × 4.1 to 6.8 μm. The fungus was identified as Cylindrocladium parasiticum Crous, M.J. Wingfield, & Alfenas (teleomorph Calonectria ilicicola) (1,2). The beta-tubulin gene fragment was amplified using the T1/Bt2b primers (3) and sequenced. The sequences of three isolates (GenBank Accession Nos. JF343965, JF429656, and JF429657), when compared with existing sequences in GenBank, had 95 to 99% sequence identity with Calonectria ilicicola (GenBank Accession Nos. AY725643 and AY725639). Pathogenicity tests were conducted by first culturing the fungus on wheat kernels for 2 weeks. Inoculated kernels were then used as inoculum and mixed with sterilized soil in a proportion of 1:20 by weight in plastic pots (10 × 9 cm). Noninoculated wheat kernels were mixed with sterilized soil in the same proportion and served as the control. Two-week-old peanut seedlings (cv. Yueyou No. 7) were transplanted into inoculated or noninoculated pots. There were five plants per pot and each treatment was replicated four times. The plants were incubated in a greenhouse at 25 ± 2°C. All of the treated plants exhibited typical basal stem and root rot symptoms of CBR 2 weeks after inoculation, while all of the control plants remained healthy. C. parasiticum was reisolated from the diseased plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of CBR on peanut in Fujian Province in Eastern China. The disease has been previously reported in Guangdong Province in Southern China but is not known elsewhere (4). This pathogen may pose a serious threat to peanut production in China, where peanut is an important crop. References: (1) D. K. Bell and E. K. Sobers. Phytopathology 56:1361, 1966. (2) P. W.

"30708932","articletitle","Trichothecene Genotype of Fusarium graminearum Isolates from Soybean (Glycine max) Seedling and Root Diseases in the United States."
"30708932","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is an economically important pathogen that causes Fusarium head blight of wheat, barley, and oat, and Gibberella ear and stalk rot of maize. More recently, F. graminearum was reported as a soybean seedling and root pathogen in North America (1,5), causing seed decay, damping-off, and brown to reddish-brown root rot symptoms. Type B trichothecene mycotoxins are commonly produced by F. graminearum, which can be categorized into three trichothecene genotypes; those that produce 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON), 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), or nivalenol (NIV). The 15-ADON genotype is dominant in populations from small grains and maize in North America (4), but the 3-ADON genotype has recently been found (4). F. graminearum was known as a pathogen of wheat and maize in North America for over a century before it was reported as a soybean pathogen. Therefore, we hypothesized that recent reports on soybean could be associated with the appearance of the 3-ADON genotype. The objective of this research was to determine the trichothecene genotype of F. graminearum isolates from soybean in the United States. Thirty-eight isolates from soybean were evaluated. Twenty-seven isolates came from a 3-year survey for Fusarium root rot from 2007 to 2009 in Iowa. Other isolates (Ahmad Fakhoury, Southern Illinois University, Carbondale) were collected from soybean seedlings during a multi-state survey in 2012, and included three isolates from Illinois, three from Indiana, and five from Nebraska. Species identification and lineage of F. graminearum were confirmed by sequencing the translation elongation factor gene (EF1-α) using EF-1H and EF-2T primers. A maximum likelihood analysis of the EF1-α, including voucher strains from nine lineages of F. graminearum (2), placed all 38 isolates into lineage 7, F. graminearum sensu stricto (representative GenBank accessions KJ415349 to KJ415352). To determine the trichothecene genotype of each isolate we used three multiplex PCR assays. The first two assays targeted a portion of trichothecene biosynthesis genes Tri3 and Tri12 (4), while the third assay targeted portions of the Tri3, Tri5, and Tri7 genes (3). The PCR for the first two assays was conducted as described by Ward et al. (4) using four sets of primers: 3CON, 3NA, 3D15A, and 3D3A; and 12CON, 12NF, 12-15F, and 12-3F for the Tri3 and Tri12 genes, respectively. The PCR for the third assay was conducted as described by Quarta et al. (3) using the following primers: Tri3F971, Tri3F1325, Tri3R1679, Tri7F340, Tri7R965, 3551H, and 4056H. The amplification products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. All 38 isolates produced amplicons consistent with the 15-ADON genotype; ~610 and 670 bp for the Tri3 and Tri12 genes, respectively (4), and two amplicons of ~708 and 525 bp for the Tri3/Tri5 genes (3). Our results indicated that the dominant trichothecene genotype among isolates of F. graminearum from soybean is 15-ADON, and the introduction of 3-ADON isolates does not explain the recent host shift of F. graminearum to soybean in North America. To our knowledge, this is the first assessment of trichothecene genotypes in F. graminearum populations from soybean from the United States. References: (1) K. E. Broders et al.

"31924620","articletitle","Comparative Genomics and Phylogenetic Analyses Suggest Several Novel Species within the Genus Clavibacter , Including Nonpathogenic Tomato-Associated Strains."
"31924620","abstracttext","Members of the genus Clavibacter are economically important bacterial plant pathogens infecting a set of diverse agricultural crops (e.g., alfalfa, corn, potato, tomato, and wheat). Tomato-associated Clavibacter sp. strains account for a great portion of the genetic diversity of the genus, and C. michiganensis sensu stricto (formerly C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis ), causing bacterial canker disease, is considered one of the most destructive seed-borne agents for the crop worldwide. However, current taxonomic descriptions of the genus do not reflect the existing diversity of the strains, resulting in unsatisfactory results in quarantine surveys for the pathogens. In this study, we used all the available genome sequences of Clavibacter sp. strains, including the type strains of newly described subspecies, to provide precise insight into the diversity of tomato-associated members of the genus and further clarify the taxonomic status of the strains using genotypic and phenotypic features. The results of phylogenetic analyses revealed the existence of nine hypothetical new species among the investigated strains. None of the three new subspecies (i.e., C. michiganensis subsp. californiensis , C. michiganensis subsp. chilensis , and C. michiganensis subsp. phaseoli ) is included within the tomato-pathogenic C. michiganensis sensu stricto lineage. Although comparative genomics revealed the lack of chp and tomA pathogenicity determinant gene clusters in the nonpathogenic strains, a number of pathogenicity-related genes were noted to be present in all the strains regardless of their pathogenicity characteristics. Altogether, our results indicate a need for a formal taxonomic reconsideration of tomato-associated Clavibacter sp. strains to facilitate differentiation of the lineages in quarantine inspections. IMPORTANCE Clavibacter spp. are economically important bacterial plant pathogens infecting a set of diverse agricultural crops, such as alfalfa, corn, pepper, potato, tomato, and wheat. A number of plant-pathogenic members of the genus (e.g., C. michiganensis sensu stricto and C. sepedonicus , infecting tomato and potato plants, respectively) are included in the A2 (high-risk) list of quarantine pathogens by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization (EPPO). Although tomato-associated members of Clavibacter spp. account for a significant portion of the genetic diversity in the genus, only the strains belonging to C. michiganensis sensu stricto (formerly C. michiganensis subsp. michiganensis ) cause bacterial canker disease of tomato and are subjected to the quarantine inspections. Hence, discrimination between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic Clavibacter sp. strains associated with tomato seeds and transplants plays a pivotal role in the accurate detection and cost-efficient management of the disease. On the other hand, detailed information on the genetic contents of different lineages of the genus would lead to the development of genome-informed specific detection techniques. In this study, we have provided an overview of the phylogenetic and genomic differences between the pathogenic and nonpathogenic tomato-associated Clavibacter sp. strains. We also noted that the taxonomic status of newly introduced subspecies of C. michiganensis (i.e., C. michiganensis subsp. californiensis , C. michiganensis subsp. chilensis , and C. michiganensis subsp. phaseoli ) should be reconsidered."

"30743597","abstracttext","Branched broomrape is a holoparasitic weed present in some areas of central and southern Chile (33°S to 38°S), which is often found parasitizing tomato and tobacco crops. During an extensive survey conducted in different tomato-growing areas during the summer of 2010, branched broomrape plants with stem rot symptoms were detected in a commercial tomato crop located in the central zone (34°14'S, 71°1'W). Rotten stems were observed with white mycelia and approximately 1-mm-diameter spherical sclerotia on affected tissue below the soil surface. Parasitized tomato plants showed no symptoms. Sclerotia were taken directly from affected stems with a dissecting needle under a stereoscopic microscope in a flow chamber and placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. Germinating sclerotia consistently produced colonies similar to Sclerotium rolfsii with new sclerotia formed within 6 to 7 days. Mycelia produced hyphal clamp connections under the light microscope (2). DNA was extracted from one fungal culture. The ITS1 region, 5.8S rRNA gene, and the ITS2 region of the nuclear-encoded ribosomal RNA gene were amplified with primers ITS1 and ITS4 (4). The sequence was deposited in GenBank (Accession No. HM222638) and showed ≥99% identity values with sequences of similar regions from Athelia rolfsii (anamorph S. rolfsii; Accession Nos. AB075304, DQ0595578, AF499018, and AB075305). Different pathogenicity tests were performed. Inoculum was prepared by placing mycelia plugs from a PDA-grown, 6-day-old colony in a flask with sterilized wheat seeds and incubated for 2 weeks. Three Orobanche plants, each one with 10 to 15 shoots at different aerial stages (starting emergence, flowering, and formed capsules) were gently planted separately in 35-cm pots. Inoculum (10 g per pot) was placed in the soil surrounding the plants. One pot was used as a control. Forty-five-day-old tomato and tobacco plants were additionally inoculated by a similar procedure. After 12 days, inoculated Orobanche plants showed reduced vigor and stem decay. After 9 days, tomato and tobacco plants showed wilt. In all cases, the fungus was reisolated on PDA from all inoculated plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of S. rolfsii on O. ramosa (1). A previous report of S. rolfsii parasitizing O. cernua has also been made (3). The high susceptibility of tomato and tobacco plants to this isolate of S. rolfsii precludes the use of this pathogen as a biological control agent against broomrape. References: (1) D. F.

"30780623","articletitle","Identification of New Alternative Weed Hosts for Iris yellow spot virus in the Pacific Northwest."
"30780623","abstracttext","Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV; family Bunyaviridae, genus Tospovirus) is an economically important viral pathogen of onion bulb and seed crops in several parts of the United States and the world (1). IYSV is primarily transmitted by onion thrips (Thrips tabaci) and there is no evidence of seed transmission (1). However, susceptible cultivated and weed species could serve as reservoirs of inoculum from which thrips could acquire the virus to introduce and spread it in onion fields. Samples from asymptomatic and symptomatic volunteer onion plants in some of the commonly cultivated crops in the region (corn, wheat, grapes, mint, carrot, alfalfa, and sugar beets) and several common weeds in and around onion bulb and seed fields with a history of IYSV in Idaho and Washington were collected during the months of July, August, September and October of 2006. More than 175 samples from 35 plant species were analyzed for IYSV by a commercially available ELISA kit (Agdia Inc., Elkhart, IN). With the exception of a few volunteer onions, none of the other plant species had any symptoms of virus infection. Symptoms on volunteer onions included characteristic diamond-shaped lesions. To confirm the presence of IYSV in the ELISA-positive samples, total nucleic acids were extracted (2) and used in a reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay (3). The primer pair consisted of 5'-TAA AAC AAA CAT TCA AAC AA-3' and 5'-CTC TTA AAC ACA TTT AAC AAG CAC-3'. This primer pair flanks the nucleocapsid (N) gene of IYSV and generates an approximate 1.2-kb amplicon (3) that includes the complete N gene. An amplicon of expected size was obtained from each IYSV-positive sample. The amplicons were cloned and sequenced. There was a 95% sequence identity with known IYSV sequences. While several weed species gave ELISA values that suggested the presence of IYSV, results of RT-PCR assays failed to confirm the presence of the virus. This discrepancy between ELISA and RT-PCR results could be due to nonspecific reaction in ELISA (4) or difficulty associated with obtaining RT-PCR-quality templates for amplification. Only volunteer onions and the following weeds tested positive for IYSV by ELISA and RT-PCR: redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), puncturevine (Tribulus terrestris), kochia (Kochia scoparia), prickly lettuce (Lactuca serriola), and common lambsquarters (Chenopodium album). Of these, redroot pigweed was recently reported to be ELISA-positive for IYSV (1). This information on the wider natural host range of IYSV, including potential alternative hosts that could serve as virus reservoirs, is useful for a better understanding of the disease epidemiology and in developing an integrated management strategy for reducing the impact of this disease.

"30731869","articletitle","First Report of a Leaf Spot on Conyza sumatrensis Caused by Phoma macrostoma in China."
"30731869","abstracttext","Conyza sumatrensis (Asteraceae), an annual or biennial plant, is native to North and South America. It is an invasive, noxious weed that is widespread in southern and southeastern China. It invades farm land and causes great losses to dry land crops, including wheat, corn, and beans. It also reduces biological diversity by crowding out native plants in the infested areas (3,4). During a search for fungal pathogens that could serve as potential biological control agents of C. sumatrensis, a leaf spot disease was observed in 2010 in Chongqing, China. An isolate (SMBC22) of a highly virulent fungus was obtained from diseased leaves. Pathogenicity tests were performed by placing 6-mm-diameter mycelial disks of 7-day-old potato dextrose agar (PDA) cultures of SMBC22 on leaves of 15 healthy greenhouse-grown plants of C. sumatrensis; the same number of control plants was treated with sterile PDA disks. Treated plants were covered with plastic bags for 24 h and maintained in a growth chamber with daily average temperatures of 24 to 26°C, continuous light (3,100 lux), and high relative humidity (>90%). Lesions similar to those observed in the field were first obvious on the SMBC22-inoculated leaves 3 days after inoculation. Symptoms became severe 7 to 9 days after inoculation. Control plants remained healthy. The fungus was reisolated from inoculated and diseased leaves and it was morphologically the same as SMBC22. The pathogenicity test was conducted three times. A survey of 10 southern and southeastern Chinese provinces revealed that the disease was widespread and it attacked leaves and stems of seedlings and mature plants of C. sumatrensis. Lesions on leaves were initially small, circular, and water soaked. The typical lesion was ovoid or fusiform, dark brown, and surrounded by a yellow halo. The spots coalesced to form large lesions and plants were often completely blighted. Fungal colonies of SMBC22 on PDA plates were initially white and turned dark gray. Colonies were circular with smooth edges with obvious rings of pycnidia on the surface. Aerial hyphae were short and dense. Pycnidia, black and immersed or semi-immersed in the medium, were visible after 12 days of incubation. Pycnidia were 72 to 140 μm in diameter. Conidia were produced in the pycnidia and were hyaline, unicellular, ellipsoidal, and 4.4 to 6.1 × 1.6 to 2.2 μm. To confirm identification of the fungus, genomic DNA was extracted from mycelia of a 7-day-old culture on PDA at 25°C (2). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene of rDNA was amplified using primers ITS4/ITS5. The gene sequence was 524 bp long and registered in NCBI GenBank (No. HQ645974). BLAST analysis showed that the current sequence had 99% homology to an isolate of Phoma macrostoma (DQ 404792) from Cirsium arvense (Canada thistle) in Canada and reported to cause chlorotic symptoms on that host plant (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of P. macrostoma causing disease on C. sumatrensis in China. P. macrostoma, thought of as a biocontrol agent of broadleaf weeds in Canada, has been patented in the United States. The current isolate of P. macrostoma is considered as a potential biocontrol agent of C. sumatrensis. References: (1) P. R. Graupner et al. J. Nat. Prod. 66:1558, 2004. (2) S. Takamatsu et al.

"30708824","articletitle","First Report of Fusarium Maize Ear Rot Caused by Fusarium meridionale in China."
"30708824","abstracttext","Fusarium is an important genus of fungal pathogens that are responsible for devastating diseases, such as Fusarium ear rot on maize, which may result in yield losses and/or mycotoxin contamination. In September 2013, a survey to determine population composition of Fusarium species on maize was conducted at 22 fields in 18 counties in Gansu Province. Maize ears with clear symptoms (with a white to pink- or salmon-colored mold at the ear tip) were collected. Symptomatic seeds were surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol and 10% sodium hypochlorite and rinsed three times with sterile water to eliminate hypochlorite residues. After drying on sterile filter paper, the seeds were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C in the dark for 3 days. Mycelium that was characteristic of Fusarium spp. (2) was purified by transferring single spores to fresh PDA. Fusarium species were identified by morphological characteristics (2), multilocus genotyping assay (MLGT) (3), and sequence analysis of the translation elongation factor-1α (TEF) gene. Several Fusarium species were identified and Fusarium verticillioides and F. proliferatum were the predominant species. Based on MLGT, two strains from Chenghong County were identified as F. meridionale with NIV chemotype, a species in F. graminearum species complex (FGSC). Morphological characteristics were also identical to FGSC. Colonies grew rapidly on PDA and produce relatively large amounts of dense mycelia and red pigments. Slender, thick-walled, and moderately curved or straight macroconidia were observed with 5- to 6-septate. Furthermore, conidia on SNA also showed typical characteristics of F. meridionale, as the dorsal and ventral lines were often parallel and gradually curved. Sequences comparison of the partial translation elongation factor (TEF-1α, 644 bp) gene (1) was used to validate these observations. BLASTn analysis with the FUSARIUM-ID database revealed 100% sequence identity to F. meridionale (GenBank Accession No. KJ137017). Thus, both morphological and molecular criteria supported identification of the strains as F. meridionale. A pathogenicity test was performed on Zhengdan958, the maize variety with the largest planted acreage in China. Four days after silk emergence, 2 ml conidial suspension (10 5 macroconidia/ml) of each isolate were injected into each of 10 maize ears through silk channel. Control plants were inoculated with sterile distilled water. Typical FER symptoms (reddish-white mold) was observed on inoculated ears and no symptoms were observed on water controls. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-isolating the same fungus from the infected seeds. F. meridionale was one of the pathogens causing Fusarium head blight on wheat and barley in China and produced nivalenol (4,5) and it also has been isolated from maize in Korea and Nepal. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. meridionale causing Fusarium ear rot on maize in China. Further studies on biological characteristics such as temperature sensibility and fungicide resistance are needed to gain a better understanding of this new pathogen. References: (1) D. M.

"2677009","articletitle","Mutations at the transit peptide-mature protein junction separate two cleavage events during chloroplast import of the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein."
"2677009","abstracttext","We have shown previously that during in vitro import into chloroplasts, the precursor of the major light-harvesting chlorphyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) generated from a wheat gene gives rise to two mature forms (25 and approximately 26 kDa) which are inserted into the thylakoids. However, during incubation of the LHCP precursor with a chloroplast-soluble extract in an organelle-free processing reaction, the NH2 terminus is cleaved, yielding only a 25-kDa peptide. In the present study, mutations at the transit peptide-mature protein junction were introduced in the LHCP precursor to investigate the relationship between the two peptides and the determinants of proteolytic processing. Mutant p delta 3 lacks 3 amino acids including Met34 at the primary cleavage site thought to give rise to the 26-kDa peptide. It is still processed during import and in the organelle-free reaction yielding in both assays only a 25-kDa peptide. Mutant p + 4 has 4 amino acids inserted immediately after Met34 and a proline that disrupts the alpha-helix predicted by the Garnier-Osguthorpe-Robson method (Garnier, J., Osguthorpe, D. J., and Robson, B. (1978) J. Mol. Biol. 120, 97-120) to extend through this region. Although p + 4 is imported, it is inefficiently processed; both a 25- and 26-kDa peptide are found, but at least 60% of the imported precursor remains uncleaved. Less than 5% is processed in the organelle-free assay. Replacement of the predicted alpha-helix in the mutant p + 4 alpha restores processing upon import into the chloroplast, but this mutant, which also has a 4-amino acid insert, yields only a 26-kDa peptide. p + 4 alpha is not processed in the organelle-free reaction. These results provide evidence that the two forms of LHCP obtained during import are the result of independent processing at two cleavage sites: the first site at Met34, and a second approximately 10 amino acids downstream within what has been designated the NH2 terminus of the mature protein. Whereas p delta 3 has the first site removed but retains a functional second site, in p + 4 alpha only the first site, or one very near it, is accessible to the processing enzyme during import. The conditions of the organelle-free reaction are specific for processing at only the secondary site. We discuss the implications of these findings in terms of the heterogeneity of LHCP in vivo."
"1692851","articletitle","Ultrastructural organization of regenerated adult dorsal root axons within transplants of fetal spinal cord."
"1692851","abstracttext","It has previously been demonstrated that the severed central branches of adult mammalian dorsal root ganglion cells regenerate into transplants of fetal spinal cord. The aim of this study was to determine whether these regenerating axons form synapses, and, if they do, to characterize them morphologically. Embryonic day 14 or 15 spinal cord was transplanted into the lumbar enlargement of adult Sprague-Dawley rats, and the L4 or L5 dorsal root was cut and then juxtaposed to the transplant. One to 3 months later the regenerated dorsal roots were labeled by anterograde filling with wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) or by immunocytochemistry for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). Dorsal root labeling with WGA-HRP demonstrated that regenerated axon terminals made synaptic contacts within transplants, and stereological electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that CGRP-immunoreactive axon terminals occupied an average of 9% of the neuropil within 2 mm of the dorsal root-transplant interface. The majority of synapses were axodendritic, but a significant percentage were axosomatic or axoaxonic. Since axoaxonic synapses were observed in transplants in which both pre- and postsynaptic profiles of axoaxonic synapses were labeled for CGRP, some regenerated axons apparently form synapses with each other. Approximately 90% of synaptic contacts were simple, 9% were complex, and 25% of the complex terminals were immunopositive for CGRP. Glia occupied 25% of the neuropil within 1 mm of the dorsal root-transplant interface, but only 6% of the neuropil 1-2 mm from the interface. We also performed a stereological analysis of the neuropil in lamina I. The area fractions of neuropil occupied by myelinated axons, perikarya, and dendrites were similar in transplants and in lamina I. However, the area fraction occupied by unmyelinated axons was significantly smaller in transplants, and the area fraction occupied by axon terminals was significantly larger in transplants compared with lamina I. Regenerated CGRP-immunoreactive synaptic terminals in transplants were significantly larger than in normal lamina I, and their synaptic contact length was also increased, suggesting that a compensatory mechanism for increasing synaptic efficiency might occur within the transplants. Synaptic density, however, was significantly reduced in transplants, indicating a smaller number of synaptic terminals per unit area. In lamina I, as in the transplant, most synapses were axodendritic, but the percentage of axosomatic and axoaxonic terminals was lower in lamina I than in the transplants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"6207067","articletitle","Regulation of hemoglobin synthesis by ecdysterone and juvenile hormone during development of Chironomus thummi (Diptera)."
"6207067","abstracttext","Chironomus thummi contains nine soluble hemoglobins (Hbs) in the larval hemolymph which can be resolved by 12.7% acrylamide gel electrophoresis (pH 8.65). Hemoglobins 2 and 3 are stage specific for the 4th instar and are first detected by day 4 of this stage in vivo, being absent in the 3rd instar. Fat-body cultures in the presence of 3H-delta-aminolevulinic acid and 14C-amino acids synthesize and secrete labelled Hbs, as was assayed by acrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoprecipitation of Hbs recovered from the culture medium. During development from 3rd instar to pupa, Chironomus fat body undergoes functional changes, being actively involved in Hb synthesis in intermolt periods and inactive with respect to Hb production during molting. The repression of Hb synthesis is reversed following the molt from the 3rd instar to the 4th instar. Metamorphosis is related to a gradual and irreversible loss of Hb synthesis and secretion by the fat body. The treatment of fat body in vitro with ecdysterone inhibits Hb synthesis in tissue from intermolt animals, even in the presence of excess methoprene, a potent juvenile hormone analogue. In contrast, immunoprecipitation of the translation products from a wheat-germ cell-free system, using mRNA from ecdysterone-treated 4th-instar fat body as a template, shows significant synthesis of globins, suggesting that ecdysterone does not affect the amount or template activity of globin messages. Methoprene induces the precocious in vitro synthesis of Hbs 2 and 3 in day-2 4th-instar fat body and enhances all Hb synthesis in the absence of ecdysterone. In vitro treatment with methoprene activates newly molted fat body to synthesize Hbs 2 and 3 in vitro. The process of Hb induction by this analogue is completely inhibited by actinomycin D or ecdysterone. Fat body from animals already exposed to high endogeneous ecdysterone titer are insensitive to treatment with this juvenile hormone analogue. Intermolt larvae normally possess stable Hb mRNA molecules, because actinomycin-D administration in vitro does not affect Hb synthesis for as long as 30 h, whereas it effectively inhibits all RNA synthesis in the fat body. Immunoprecipitation of globin translated in vitro from mRNA from 2-day-old 4th-instar larvae treated in vivo with methoprene shows enhanced synthesis of globins 2 and 3, as compared to controls with no treatment. It is suggested that both juvenile hormone and ecdysterone regulate Hb synthesis in Chironomus; juvenile hormone affecting the activity of Hb genes, and ecdysterone modulating the level of Hb gene expression."
"9057330","articletitle","Cloning and mapping of a putative barley NADPH-dependent HC-toxin reductase."
"9057330","abstracttext","The NADPH-dependent HC-toxin reductase (HCTR), encoded by Hm1 in maize, inactivates HC-toxin produced by the fungus Cochliobolus carbonum, and thus confers resistance to the pathogen. The fact that C. carbonum only infects maize (Zea mays) and is the only species known to produce HC-toxin raises the question: What are the biological functions of HCTR in other plant species? An HCTR-like enzyme may function to detoxify toxins produced by pathogens which infect other plant species (R. B. Meeley, G. S. Johal, S. E. Briggs, and J. D. Walton, Plant Cell, 4:71-77, 1992). Hm1 homolog in rice (Y. Hihara, M. Umeda, C. Hara, Q. Liu, S. Aotsuka, K. Toriyama, and H. Uchimiya, unpublished) and HCTR activity in barley, wheat, oats and sorghum have been reported (R. B. Meeley and J. D. Walton, Plant Physiol. 97:1080-1086, 1993). To investigate the sequence conservation of Hm1 and HCTR in barley and the possible relationship of barley Hm1 homolog to the known disease resistance genes, we cloned and mapped a barley (Hordeum vulgare) Hm1-like gene. A putative full-length cDNA clone, Bhm1-18, was isolated from a cDNA library consisting of mRNA from young leaves, inflorescences, and immature embryos. This 1,297-bp clone encodes 363 amino acids which show great similarity (81.6%) with the amino acid sequence of HM1 in maize. Two loci were mapped to barley molecular marker linkage maps with Bhm1-18 as the probe; locus A (Bhm1A) on the long arm of chromosome 1, and locus B (Bhm1B) on the short arm of chromosome 1 which is syntenic to maize chromosome 9 containing the Hm2 locus. The Bhm1-18 probe hybridized strongly to a Southern blot of a wide range of grass species, indicating high conservation of HCTR at the DNA sequence level among grasses. The HCTR mRNA was detected in barley roots, leaves, inflorescences, and immature embryos. The conservation of the HCTR sequence, together with its expression in other plant species (R. B. Meeley and J. D. Walton, Plant Physiol. 97:1080-1086, 1993), suggest HCTR plays an important functional role in other plant species."
"8375391","articletitle","In vivo regulation of low-density lipoprotein receptors by estrogen differs at the post-transcriptional level in rat and mouse."
"8375391","abstracttext","Rats and mice are frequently used in studies of the regulation of lipoprotein metabolism. Although the species are closely related, they differ dramatically in the responses of their lipoproteins to estrogen administration. In rats, estrogens produce profound decreases in the levels of all plasma lipoproteins and this is attributed largely to estrogen-induced increases of hepatic low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-receptor) activity. Estrogens affect mouse plasma lipoproteins to a much lesser extent. Therefore, one of our aims was to compare the regulation of LDL-receptor gene expression in rats and mice at several potential loci of regulation. To assess the specificity of the estrogen effect, we also compared the responses of apolipoprotein AI (apoAI), apolipoprotein B (apoB), and beta-actin to the response of the LDL-receptor. In male Sprague Dawley rats given 17 beta-estradiol or 17 alpha-ethinyl estradiol at supraphysiological doses of 5 micrograms/g body mass/day, plasma total cholesterol and triacylglycerols fell to approximately 5% and approximately 50%, and, plasma apoAI and apoB fell to approximately 12% and approximately 16% of controls, respectively. By contrast, in male C3H/HeJ mice the above parameters dropped only to approximately 65% of controls and apoB concentrations rose to approximately 200% of controls. In rats, relative rates of LDL-receptor mRNA transcription (nuclear 'run-off' assay) and total hepatic, nuclear and polysomal LDL-receptor mRNA levels (RNase protection assay) increased by 1.5-2-fold, while synthesis of LDL-receptor protein on hepatic polysomes (in a wheat-germ translation system) increased 8-fold and LDL-receptor protein mass in hepatic plasma membranes increased 10-fold (by immunoblotting). In mouse liver, too, LDL-receptor mRNA levels increased 1.5-fold and the LDL-receptor mRNA transcription start sites in rat and mouse were found to be the same, but mouse LDL-receptor protein mass did not change, i.e. LDL-receptors of mice were similar to rat with respect to transcriptional regulation, but differed in their post-transcriptional control mechanisms. In rats, estrogen administration increased apoAI mRNA transcription rates 1.6-fold and also apoAI mRNA levels in total liver homogenates, nuclei and polysomes, (2-fold for each) consistent with transcriptional regulation. However, apoAI synthesis on total RNA increased less than apoAI mRNA, indicating that apoAI translational control mechanisms, at least in part, also regulate hepatic rates of apoAI production. ApoB mRNA transcription rates and levels showed small increases following estrogen administration. Hepatic beta-actin mRNA transcription and levels did not change.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

"10903861","abstracttext","Celiac disease is a wheat gliadin-promoted disorder that displays a complex genetic susceptibility associated with HLA-DQ2, and one or more unknown factor(s), possibly gliadin-like. The presence of mammalian proteins with partial gliadin similarity was suggested by transglutaminase-independent multi-tissue reactivity of gliadin-immunopurified antibodies from celiac patients. No non-plant sequence, however, was identified in gliadin peptide epitope searches of non-redundant and EST databanks via TBLASTN, BLASTP and FASTA, even at E values as high as 20. Therefore, an alpha-gliadin cDNA screen of human cDNA and genomic libraries was undertaken, an approach in keeping with positive human Northern and Southern analyses with the same probe. Four distinct cDNA clones were obtained, the most stringent of which (3.2 and 5.1 kb) were novel, and featured potential open reading frames with high gliadin domain II and domain IV homologies (BestFit quality scores >/=295 and 322, respectively, versus random value 126-127). Both were also homologous to ESTs. An additional 5' gliadin oligonucleotide screen identified the widely distributed cytoplasmic protein acyl coA hydrolase whose homology was restricted to the oligonucleotide probe (BestFit quality=215 versus 100 for random); and achaete-scute homologous protein, which displays particularly high gliadin domain II homology (BestFit quality 316 versus 111 for random). Genomic screening uncovered 16 positives, one of which was the ALR gene, whose similarity to three of gliadin's five domains (I, II and IV; BestFit quality 322-473 versus 121-154 for random) was remarkable. More extensive was novel genomic clone 2, with fragments hybridizing to cDNA probes approximating gliadin domains I, II+IV, V and the gliadin 5' untranslated region, and mapping by FISH to 19q13.11-13. 12. Two fragments were sequenced; one was exonic, as predicted by four different programs; and test oligonucleotides suggested widespread 4 and/or 2 kb mRNA expression, even at high stringency (t(m)-8.8 deg. C). Taken together, it is apparent that several genes with partial gliadin homology exist in the human genome. Many bear gliadin-like T-cell epitopes, are expressed in intestine and, like transglutaminase, are cytoplasmic. Glutamine to glutamic acid or other mutation within such epitopes followed by injury or infection-related release could explain enhanced disease susceptibility in affected families."
"11526037","articletitle","A second quorum-sensing system regulates cell surface properties but not phenazine antibiotic production in Pseudomonas aureofaciens."
"11526037","abstracttext","The root-associated biological control bacterium Pseudomonas aureofaciens 30-84 produces a range of exoproducts, including protease and phenazines. Phenazine antibiotic biosynthesis by phzXYFABCD is regulated in part by the PhzR-PhzI quorum-sensing system. Mutants defective in phzR or phzI produce very low levels of phenazines but wild-type levels of exoprotease. In the present study, a second genomic region of strain 30-84 was identified that, when present in trans, increased beta-galactosidase activity in a genomic phzB::lacZ reporter and partially restored phenazine production to a phzR mutant. Sequence analysis identified two adjacent genes, csaR and csaI, that encode members of the LuxR-LuxI family of regulatory proteins. No putative promoter region is present upstream of the csaI start codon and no lux box-like element was found in either the csaR promoter or the 30-bp intergenic region between csaR and csaI. Both the PhzR-PhzI and CsaR-CsaI systems are regulated by the GacS-GacA two-component regulatory system. In contrast to the multicopy effects of csaR and csaI in trans, a genomic csaR mutant (30-84R2) and a csaI mutant (30-84I2) did not exhibit altered phenazine production in vitro or in situ, indicating that the CsaR-CsaI system is not involved in phenazine regulation in strain 30-84. Both mutants also produced wild-type levels of protease. However, disruption of both csaI and phzI or both csaR and phzR eliminated both phenazine and protease production completely. Thus, the two quorum-sensing systems do not interact for phenazine regulation but do interact for protease regulation. Additionally, the CsaI N-acylhomoserine lactone (AHL) signal was not recognized by the phenazine AHL reporter 30-84I/Z but was recognized by the AHL reporters Chromobacterium violaceum CV026 and Agrobacterium tumefaciens A136(pCF240). Inactivation of csaR resulted in a smooth mucoid colony phenotype and formation of cell aggregates in broth, suggesting that CsaR is involved in regulating biosynthesis of cell surface components. Strain 30-84I/I2 exhibited mucoid colony and clumping phenotypes similar to those of 30-84R2. Both phenotypes were reversed by complementation with csaR-csaI or by the addition of the CsaI AHL signal. Both quorum-sensing systems play a role in colonization by strain 30-84. Whereas loss of PhzR resulted in a 6.6-fold decrease in colonization by strain 30-84 on wheat roots in natural soil, a phzR csaR double mutant resulted in a 47-fold decrease. These data suggest that gene(s) regulated by the CsaR-CsaI system also plays a role in the rhizosphere competence of P. aureofaciens 30-84."
"15148605","articletitle","Mutational analysis of the binding affinity and transport activity for N-acetylglucosamine of the novel ABC transporter Ngc in the chitin-degrader Streptomyces olivaceoviridis."
"15148605","abstracttext","The highly differentiated bacterium Streptomyces olivaceoviridis efficiently hydrolyses chitin, a highly abundant natural polysaccharide, to low molecular weight products including N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N,N' -diacetylchitobiose (chitobiose). NAG is taken up by a PTS (phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system) which includes the PtsC2 protein, and via the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter Ngc, which itself includes the substrate-binding protein NgcE. This is at present the only ABC transporter which is known to mediate specific uptake of NAG (K(m) 0.48 microM, V(max) 1.3 nmol/min/mg dry weight) and is competitively inhibited by chitobiose (K(i) 0.68 microM). The latter finding suggests that the Ngc system transports both NAG and chitobiose efficiently. To identify amino acid residues required for the function of NgcE, either the wild-type or one of several mutant forms of the ngcE gene was introduced into the strain S. olivaceoviridis DeltaNgcE/DeltaPtsC1/DeltaPtsC2, which lacks both functional transport systems for NAG, and chromosomal recombinants were selected. Based on the in vivo transport parameters of the recombinants, and the in vitro binding characteristics of the corresponding purified proteins, the following conclusions can be drawn. (1) Replacement of the C-terminally located residue Y396 by A (Y396A) has little effect on ligand-binding or transport parameters. The W395A mutation also induced little change in the substrate affinity in vitro, but it led in vivo to a marked increase (11 fold) in K(m), and enhanced V(max) (by 1.5 fold). (2) The amino acids Y201 and W280 both contribute (51% and 38%) to the ligand-binding capacity of NgcE. They are both very important for the in vivo function of the complete transport apparatus; strains expressing either Y201A or W280A show drastically (100 or 150 times) enhanced K(m) values. (3) The concomitant presence of either Y200 and W280 or Y201 and W280 is essential for the function of NgcE. (4) Y201 is located within a tyrosyl-rich motif. This has been found to share some features with the ligand-binding site of amelogenins (enamel matrix proteins), which interact with NAG residues in glycoconjugates. In addition, it is distantly related to the ligand-binding site(s) in the plant-lectins UDA ( Urtica dioicaagglutinin, specific for NAG and its oligomers) and WGA (wheat germ agglutinin, which recognises a motif comprising three consecutive NAG residues)."

"18809864","abstracttext","The efficacy of corn expressing an Escherichia coli-derived gene (corn-based phytase; CBP) and an E. coli-derived microbial phytase (expressed in Pichia pastoris) sprayed onto a wheat carrier (Quantum) was comparatively evaluated in two 14-d broiler chicken studies. In experiment 1, a total of 288 seven-day-old male broiler chicks were grouped by weight into 8 blocks of 6 cages, with 6 birds per cage, and used to measure growth performance, bone mineralization, and nutrient utilization. In experiment 2, a total of 192 seven-day-old male broiler chicks were used, with 4 birds per cage. Six dietary treatment groups were randomly allotted to the cages within each of 8 blocks. The corn-soybean meal-based diets used in each study consisted of a positive control adequate in P and Ca; a negative control (NC) low in P and Ca (no added inorganic P); the NC supplemented with 3,630, 36,300, or 363,000 phytase units (FTU) of CBP/kg; and the NC + 3,630 FTU of Quantum/kg. Growth performance and bone mineralization criteria were reevaluated in the second broiler study. Data from the 2 experiments were combined because there was no diet x experiment interaction and analyzed as a randomized complete block design. Weight gain decreased (P < 0.05) with a reduction in dietary P and Ca in the NC diet. Weight gain, feed efficiency, and percentage of tibia ash of birds fed 3,630 FTU/kg of either CBP or Quantum phytase were not different. There was a quadratic response (P < 0.01) to CBP supplementation of the NC diets in weight gain of the broiler chicks. Feed intake increased quadratically (P < 0.01) with CBP supplementation of the NC diets, but CBP supplementation of the NC diets did not affect feed efficiency. Tibia ash of birds fed the positive control diet was greater (P < 0.01) than that of birds fed the NC diet. There was a quadratic response (P < 0.01) to CBP supplementation of the NC diets in tibia ash of the broiler chicks. Birds fed supplemental phytase had greater (P < 0.01) ileal and total tract P and Ca digestibility than birds fed the NC diet. Data from the study suggest that E. coli phytase expressed in corn is efficacious in P-deficient broiler chick diets for the improvement of growth performance and indices of P utilization, which would minimize the need for supplemental P in broiler diets."

"21880343","abstracttext","Denitrification beds are containers filled with wood by-products that serve as a carbon and energy source to denitrifiers, which reduce nitrate (NO(3)(-)) from point source discharges into non-reactive dinitrogen (N(2)) gas. This study investigates a range of alternative carbon sources and determines rates, mechanisms and factors controlling NO(3)(-) removal, denitrifying bacterial community, and the adverse effects of these substrates. Experimental barrels (0.2 m(3)) filled with either maize cobs, wheat straw, green waste, sawdust, pine woodchips or eucalyptus woodchips were incubated at 16.8 °C or 27.1 °C (outlet temperature), and received NO(3)(-) enriched water (14.38 mg N L(-1) and 17.15 mg N L(-1)). After 2.5 years of incubation measurements were made of NO(3)(-)-N removal rates, in vitro denitrification rates (DR), factors limiting denitrification (carbon and nitrate availability, dissolved oxygen, temperature, pH, and concentrations of NO(3)(-), nitrite and ammonia), copy number of nitrite reductase (nirS and nirK) and nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ) genes, and greenhouse gas production (dissolved nitrous oxide (N(2)O) and methane), and carbon (TOC) loss. Microbial denitrification was the main mechanism for NO(3)(-)-N removal. Nitrate-N removal rates ranged from 1.3 (pine woodchips) to 6.2 g N m(-3) d(-1) (maize cobs), and were predominantly limited by C availability and temperature (Q(10) = 1.2) when NO(3)(-)-N outlet concentrations remained above 1 mg L(-1). The NO(3)(-)-N removal rate did not depend directly on substrate type, but on the quantity of microbially available carbon, which differed between carbon sources. The abundance of denitrifying genes (nirS, nirK and nosZ) was similar in replicate barrels under cold incubation, but varied substantially under warm incubation, and between substrates. Warm incubation enhanced growth of nirS containing bacteria and bacteria that lacked the nosZ gene, potentially explaining the greater N(2)O emission in warmer environments. Maize cob substrate had the highest NO(3)(-)-N removal rate, but adverse effects include TOC release, dissolved N(2)O release and substantial carbon consumption by non-denitrifiers. Woodchips removed less than half of NO(3)(-) removed by maize cobs, but provided ideal conditions for denitrifying bacteria, and adverse effects were not observed. Therefore we recommend the combination of maize cobs and woodchips to enhance NO(3)(-) removal while minimizing adverse effects in denitrification beds."

Cows were then randomly assigned (n=7/diet) to either the same CON diet or a moderate-energy close-up diet (OVE; net energy for lactation=1.47 Mcal/kg of DM) until parturition. Biopsies of SAT were harvested at -10, 7, and 21 d for mRNA expression of 48 genes associated with insulin signaling, adipogenesis, and lipolysis. In vitro basal and insulin-stimulated insulin receptor substrate 1 tyrosine phosphorylation (IRS1-PY) was assessed at -10 and 7 d. The OVE led to more positive energy balance and greater serum insulin concentration prepartum. Compared with CON, OVE led to a more drastic increase in serum NEFA and also greater overall serum BHBA postcalving, both of which were associated with greater hepatic total lipid and triacylglycerol concentration. Close-up OVE did not improve any aspect of performance. In prepartal SAT, insulin-stimulated IRS1-PY was greater in OVE than in CON. However, IRS1-PY, serum insulin, and GLUT4 expression decreased postpartum regardless of prepartal treatment, suggesting a more severe state of insulin resistance. The expression of all genes encoding adipogenic regulators (PPARG and ZFP423), most lipogenic enzymes/inducers (FASN, SCD, DGAT2, and INSIG1), and basal-lipolysis regulators (ATGL and ABDH5) was greater at -10 d in OVE than in CON. Whereas adipogenic and basal lipolysis regulator expression remained greater in cows fed OVE by 7 d postpartum, expression of all lipogenic enzymes decreased regardless of diet. Despite those responses, the approximately 3-fold increase in expression of IRS1 and ZFP423 between 7 and 21 d suggested that insulin responsiveness and adipogenic capacity of SAT were partially restored. Expression of the preadipocyte marker DLK1, adiponutrin (PNPLA3), and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) was undetectable. Results suggested that close-up energy overfeeding did not exacerbate insulin resistance in SAT. Signs of restored insulin responsiveness (upregulation of IRS1, INSIG2, SREBF1, and ZFP423) were apparent as early as 3 wk postpartum. Thus, identifying specific nutrients capable of activating PPARγ after calving in AT might help accelerate its replenishment. A regulatory network encompassing the genes and physiological measurements obtained is proposed."

"22802186","abstracttext","Phytase B, a product of Aspergillus niger phyB gene expressed in Trichoderma reesei, which increased myo-inositol concentrations in 20 mM sodium phytate solution 7.5-fold during 120-min incubation, a combination of phytase B with 6-phytase A, and pure myo-inositol were tested as feed supplements in Bovans Brown laying hens. In the 2-factorial experiment (2×5), birds from wk 50 to 62 were fed 2 basal diets, corn-soybean (CSM) or wheat-soybean (WSM), using 12 one-hen cages per treatment. For both basal diets, the dietary treatments included negative control (0.08% nonphytate P in CSM, 0.13% nonphytate P in WSM; NC); internal control groups, NC+0.04% nonphytate P from monocalcium phosphate, MCP (IC); NC+0.1% of myo-inositol (Inos), NC+phytase B at 1,300 units of phytase B-acid phosphatase activity (AcPU)/kg (PhyB), NC+phytase B at 1,300 AcPU/kg+6-phytase A at 300 FTU/kg (PhyA+B). Feed intake, laying performance, and eggshell quality were determined. The total lipid and cholesterol contents as well as fatty acid profile were assessed in egg yolks collected from hens fed CSM diets, as was fatty acid profile. The hens fed the WSM diet consumed significantly more feed, laid a higher mass of eggs daily with higher mean weights, and had a higher hen-day egg production than the birds receiving the CSM diets. Similarly, higher values for yolk weights, shell weights, shell thickness, shell density, and breaking strengths were determined in the eggs laid by the hens fed the WSM diets. In hens fed either the CSM diets with phytase B alone, or in combination with 6-phytase A, enhanced feed intakes, egg mass, and hen-day egg production were recorded. Phytases also enhanced the eggshell quality parameters in the hens fed both variants of the diets. Phytase B alone, or in combination with 6-phytase A, reduced the total lipid and cholesterol concentrations in egg yolks collected from the hens fed the CSM diets, whereas the combination of both phytases improved the n-6:n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ratio. In the CSM diets, the supplemental myo-inositol suppressed feed intakes, reduced egg production, had no effect on eggshell quality and reduced the deposition of eicosanoid fatty acids in yolks. When comparing the effects of feeding MCP, myo-inositol, and phytases on the nutritional quality of the eggs laid by the hens fed phosphorus-deficient CSM diets, it seems that the enhancements in nutritional quality cannot be attributed solely to higher phosphorus level or higher concentrations of myo-inositol."
"23050764","articletitle","Association of a bitter taste receptor mutation with Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN)."
"23050764","abstracttext_background","Balkan Endemic Nephropathy (BEN) is late-onset kidney disease thought to arise from chronic exposure to aristolochic acid, a phytotoxin that contaminates wheat supplies in rural areas of Eastern Europe. It has recently been demonstrated that humans are capable of perceiving aristolochic acid at concentrations below 40 nM as the result of high-affinity interactions with the TAS2R43 bitter taste receptor. Further, TAS2R43 harbors high-frequency loss-of-function mutations resulting in 50-fold variability in perception. This suggests that genetic variation in TAS2R43 might affect susceptibility to BEN, with individuals carrying functional forms of the receptor being protected by an ability to detect tainted foods."
"23050764","abstracttext_methods","To determine whether genetic variation in TAS2R43 predicts BEN susceptibility, we examined genotype-phenotype associations in a case-control study. A cohort of 88 affected and 99 control subjects from western Bulgaria were genotyped with respect to two key missense variants and a polymorphic whole-gene deletion of TAS2R43 (W35S, H212R, and wt/Δ), which are known to affect taste sensitivity to aristolochic acid. Tests for association between haplotypes and BEN status were then performed."
"23050764","abstracttext_results","Three major TAS2R43 haplotypes observed in previous studies (TAS2R43-W35/H212, -S35/R212 and -Δ) were present at high frequencies (0.17, 0.36, and 0.47 respectively) in our sample, and a significant association between genotype and BEN status was present (P = 0.020; odds ratio 1.18). However, contrary to expectation, BEN was positively associated with TAS2R43-W35/H212, a highly responsive allele previously shown to confer elevated bitter sensitivity to aristolochic acid, which should drive aversion but might also affect absorption, altering toxin activation."
"23050764","abstracttext_conclusions","Our findings are at strong odds with the prediction that carriers of functional alleles of TAS2R43 are protected from BEN by an ability to detect and avoid aristolochic acid exposure. Evidence for a positive association between high-sensitivity alleles and BEN status suggests instead that possession of toxin-responsive receptor variants may paradoxically increase vulnerability, possibly by shifting attractive responses associated with low-intensity bitter sensations. The broad-spectrum tuning of the ~25-member TAS2R family as a whole toward xenobiotics points to a potentially far-reaching relevance of bitter responses to exposure-related disease in both individuals and populations."

"24093800","abstracttext_background","Global warming predictions indicate that temperatures will increase by another 2-6°C by the end of this century. High temperature is a major abiotic stress limiting plant growth and productivity in many areas of the world. Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.) is a model herbaceous bioenergy crop, due to its rapid growth rate, reliable biomass yield, minimal requirements of water and nutrients, adaptability to grow on marginal lands and widespread distribution throughout North America. The effect of high temperature on switchgrass physiology, cell wall composition and biomass yields has been reported. However, there is void in the knowledge of the molecular responses to heat stress in switchgrass."
"24093800","abstracttext_results","We conducted long-term heat stress treatment (38°/30°C, day/night, for 50 days) in the switchgrass cultivar Alamo. A significant decrease in the plant height and total biomass was evident in the heat stressed plants compared to controls. Total RNA from control and heat stress samples were used for transcriptome analysis with switchgrass Affymetrix genechips. Following normalization and pre-processing, 5365 probesets were identified as differentially expressed using a 2-fold cutoff. Of these, 2233 probesets (2000 switchgrass unigenes) were up-regulated, and 3132 probesets (2809 unigenes) were down-regulated. Differential expression of 42 randomly selected genes from this list was validated using RT-PCR. Rice orthologs were retrieved for 78.7% of the heat stress responsive switchgrass probesets. Gene ontology (GOs) enrichment analysis using AgriGO program showed that genes related to ATPase regulator, chaperone binding, and protein folding was significantly up-regulated. GOs associated with protein modification, transcription, phosphorus and nitrogen metabolic processes, were significantly down-regulated by heat stress."
"24093800","abstracttext_conclusions","Plausible connections were identified between the identified GOs, physiological responses and heat response phenotype observed in switchgrass plants. Comparative transcriptome analysis in response to heat stress among four monocots - switchgrass, rice, wheat and maize identified 16 common genes, most of which were associated with protein refolding processes. These core genes will be valuable biomarkers for identifying heat sensitive plant germplasm since they are responsive to both short duration as well as chronic heat stress treatments, and are also expressed in different plant growth stages and tissue types."

To date, over hundreds of fungal genomes are publicly available. However, a systematic comparative analysis of fungal CAZymes across the entire fungal kingdom has not been reported."
"24422981","abstracttext_results","In this study, we systemically identified glycoside hydrolases (GHs), polysaccharide lyases (PLs), carbohydrate esterases (CEs), and glycosyltransferases (GTs) as well as carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) in the predicted proteomes of 94 representative fungi from Ascomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota, and Zygomycota. Comparative analysis of these CAZymes that play major roles in plant polysaccharide degradation revealed that fungi exhibit tremendous diversity in the number and variety of CAZymes. Among them, some families of GHs and CEs are the most prevalent CAZymes that are distributed in all of the fungi analyzed. Importantly, cellulases of some GH families are present in fungi that are not known to have cellulose-degrading ability. In addition, our results also showed that in general, plant pathogenic fungi have the highest number of CAZymes. Biotrophic fungi tend to have fewer CAZymes than necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi. Pathogens of dicots often contain more pectinases than fungi infecting monocots. Interestingly, besides yeasts, many saprophytic fungi that are highly active in degrading plant biomass contain fewer CAZymes than plant pathogenic fungi. Furthermore, analysis of the gene expression profile of the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum revealed that most of the CAZyme genes related to cell wall degradation were up-regulated during plant infection. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed a complex history of lineage-specific expansions and attritions for the PL1 family."

"25046106","abstracttext","Most plant-origin fiber sources used in pig production contains a mixture of soluble and insoluble non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). The knowledge about effects of these sources of NSP on the gut microbiota and its fermentation products is still scarce. The aim of this study was to investigate effects of feeding diets with native sources of NSP on the ileal and fecal microbial composition and the dietary impact on the concentration of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and lactic acid. The experiment comprised four diets and four periods in a change-over design with seven post valve t-cecum cannulated growing pigs. The four diets were balanced to be similar in NSP content and included one of four fiber sources, two diets were rich in pectins, through inclusion of chicory forage (CFO) and sugar beet pulp, and two were rich in arabinoxylan, through inclusion of wheat bran (WB) and grass meal. The gut microbial composition was assessed with terminal restriction fragment (TRF) length polymorphism and the abundance of Lactobacillus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas and the β-xylosidase gene, xynB, were assessed with quantitative PCR. The gut microbiota did not cluster based on NSP structure (arabinoxylan or pectin) rather, the effect was to a high degree ingredient specific. In pigs fed diet CFO, three TRFs related to Prevotellaceae together consisted of more than 25% of the fecal microbiota, which is about 3 to 23 times higher (P<0.05) than in pigs fed the other diets. Whereas pigs fed diet WB had about 2 to 22 times higher abundance (P<0.05) of Megasphaera elsdenii in feces and about six times higher abundance (P<0.05) of Lactobacillus reuteri in ileal digesta than pigs fed the other diets. The total amount of digested NSP (r=0.57; P=0.002), xylose (r=0.53; P=0.004) and dietary fiber (r=0.60; P=0.001) in ileal digesta were positively correlated with an increased abundance of Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas. The effect on SCFA was correlated to specific neutral sugars where xylose increased the ileal butyric acid proportion, whereas arabinose increased the fecal butyric acid proportion. Moreover, chicory pectin increased the acetic acid proportion in both ileal digesta and feces."
"28878756","articletitle","Analysis of Microbial Functions in the Rhizosphere Using a Metabolic-Network Based Framework for Metagenomics Interpretation."
"28878756","abstracttext","Advances in metagenomics enable high resolution description of complex bacterial communities in their natural environments. Consequently, conceptual approaches for community level functional analysis are in high need. Here, we introduce a framework for a metagenomics-based analysis of community functions. Environment-specific gene catalogs, derived from metagenomes, are processed into metabolic-network representation. By applying established ecological conventions, network-edges (metabolic functions) are assigned with taxonomic annotations according to the dominance level of specific groups. Once a function-taxonomy link is established, prediction of the impact of dominant taxa on the overall community performances is assessed by simulating removal or addition of edges (taxa associated functions). This approach is demonstrated on metagenomic data describing the microbial communities from the root environment of two crop plants - wheat and cucumber. Predictions for environment-dependent effects revealed differences between treatments (root vs. soil), corresponding to documented observations. Metabolism of specific plant exudates (e.g., organic acids, flavonoids) was linked with distinct taxonomic groups in simulated root, but not soil, environments. These dependencies point to the impact of these metabolite families as determinants of community structure. Simulations of the activity of pairwise combinations of taxonomic groups (order level) predicted the possible production of complementary metabolites. Complementation profiles allow formulating a possible metabolic role for observed co-occurrence patterns. For example, production of tryptophan-associated metabolites through complementary interactions is unique to the tryptophan-deficient cucumber root environment. Our approach enables formulation of testable predictions for species contribution to community activity and exploration of the functional outcome of structural shifts in complex bacterial communities. Understanding community-level metabolism is an essential step toward the manipulation and optimization of microbial function. Here, we introduce an analysis framework addressing three key challenges of such data: producing quantified links between taxonomy and function; contextualizing discrete functions into communal networks; and simulating environmental impact on community performances. New technologies will soon provide a high-coverage description of biotic and a-biotic aspects of complex microbial communities such as these found in gut and soil. This framework was designed to allow the integration of high-throughput metabolomic and metagenomic data toward tackling the intricate associations between community structure, community function, and metabolic inputs."

Swollenin SWO1 is the major expansin-like protein from the fungus Trichoderma reesei. Here, we have performed a detailed characterization of a recombinant native form of SWO1 with respect to its possible auxiliary role in the enzymatic saccharification of lignocellulosic substrates."
"27570542","abstracttext_results","The swo1 gene was overexpressed in T. reesei QM9414 Δxyr1 mutant, featuring downregulated cellulase production, and the protein was purified from culture supernatant. SWO1 was N-glycosylated and its circular dichroism spectrum suggested a folded protein. Adsorption isotherms (25 °C, pH 5.0, 1.0 mg substrate/mL) revealed SWO1 to be 120- and 20-fold more specific for binding to birchwood xylan and kraft lignin, respectively, than for binding to Avicel PH-101. The SWO1 binding capacity on lignin (25 µmol/g) exceeded 12-fold that on Avicel PH-101 (2.1 µmol/g). On xylan, not only the binding capacity (22 µmol/g) but also the affinity of SWO1 (K d = 0.08 µM) was enhanced compared to Avicel PH-101 (K d = 0.89 µM). SWO1 caused rapid release of a tiny amount of reducing sugars (<1 % of total) from different substrates (Avicel PH-101, nanocrystalline cellulose, steam-pretreated wheat straw, barley β-glucan, cellotetraose) but did not promote continued saccharification. Atomic force microscopy revealed that amorphous cellulose films were not affected by SWO1. Also with AFM, binding of SWO1 to cellulose nanocrystallites was demonstrated at the single-molecule level, but adsorption did not affect this cellulose. SWO1 exhibited no synergy with T. reesei cellulases in the hydrolysis of the different celluloses. However, SWO1 boosted slightly (1.5-fold) the reducing sugar release from a native grass substrate."
"27570542","abstracttext_conclusions","SWO1 is a strongly glycosylated protein, which has implications for producing it in heterologous hosts. Although SWO1 binds to crystalline cellulose, its adsorption to xylan is much stronger. SWO1 is not an auxiliary factor of the enzymatic degradation of a variety of cellulosic substrates. Effect of SWO1 on sugar release from intact plant cell walls might be exploitable with certain (e.g., mildly pretreated) lignocellulosic feedstocks."

"29402331","abstracttext_background","The relative importance of stochasticity versus determinism in soil bacterial communities is unclear, as are the possible influences that alter the balance between these. Here, we investigated the influence of spatial scale on the relative role of stochasticity and determinism in agricultural monocultures consisting only of wheat, thereby minimizing the influence of differences in plant species cover and in cultivation/disturbance regime, extending across a wide range of soils and climates of the North China Plain (NCP). We sampled 243 sites across 1092 km and sequenced the 16S rRNA bacterial gene using MiSeq. We hypothesized that determinism would play a relatively stronger role at the broadest scales, due to the strong influence of climate and soil differences in selecting many distinct OTUs of bacteria adapted to the different environments. In order to test the more general applicability of the hypothesis, we also compared with a natural ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau."
"29402331","abstracttext_results","Our results revealed that the relative importance of stochasticity vs. determinism did vary with spatial scale, in the direction predicted. On the North China Plain, stochasticity played a dominant role from 150 to 900 km (separation between pairs of sites) and determinism dominated at more than 900 km (broad scale). On the Tibetan Plateau, determinism played a dominant role from 130 to 1200 km and stochasticity dominated at less than 130 km. Among the identifiable deterministic factors, soil pH showed the strongest influence on soil bacterial community structure and diversity across the North China Plain. Together, 23.9% of variation in soil microbial community composition could be explained, with environmental factors accounting for 19.7% and spatial parameters 4.1%."
"29402331","abstracttext_conclusions","Our findings revealed that (1) stochastic processes are relatively more important on the North China Plain, while deterministic processes are more important on the Tibetan Plateau; (2) soil pH was the major factor in shaping soil bacterial community structure of the North China Plain; and (3) most variation in soil microbial community composition could not be explained with existing environmental and spatial factors. Further studies are needed to dissect the influence of stochastic factors (e.g., mutations or extinctions) on soil microbial community distribution, which might make it easier to predictably manipulate the microbial community to produce better yield and soil sustainability outcomes."

Two hundred pigs (initial BW: 6.31 ± 0.73 kg) were allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments (5 pigs per pen and 10 pens per treatment). Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial design with 2 diet types [low-fiber (LF) or high-fiber (HF)] and 2 concentrations of DFM (0 or 60 g DFM/t of feed). The DFM contained 1.5 × 10 cfu/g and was obtained from Danisco Animal Nutrition-DuPont Industrial Biosciences, Marlborough, UK. Phase 1 diets were fed for 2 wk post-weaning and phase 2 diets were fed over the following 29 d. Low fiber diets contained corn and soybean meal as main ingredients and HF diets contained corn, soybean meal, corn distillers dried grains with solubles (7.5 and 15.0% in phase 1 and 2, respectively), and wheat middlings (10.0%). Pigs and feed were weighed at the start and at the end of each phase, and ADG, ADFI, and G:F were calculated. At the conclusion of phase 2, blood was collected from 1 pig per pen and 1 pig per pen was sacrificed. Cecum and rectum contents were analyzed for VFA, and tissue samples were collected from the ileum, cecum, rectum, and liver to determine expression of genes related to absorption and metabolism of VFA using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR. Results indicated that feeding HF diets reduced ( ≤ 0.05) ADFI and ADG of pigs compared with feeding LF diets. Pigs fed DFM diets had improved ( ≤ 0.05) G:F compared with pigs fed non-DFM diets. Pigs fed LF diets had greater ( ≤ 0.05) BW at the end of phase 2 compared with pigs fed HF diets. The concentration of VFA in rectum contents was greater ( ≤ 0.05) in pigs fed LF diets than in pigs fed HF diets. The expression of in the rectum of pigs fed HF diets was greater ( ≤ 0.05) than for pigs fed LF diets, and pigs fed DFM-containing diets had an increased ( ≤ 0.05) expression of in the liver. Pigs fed HF diets had greater ( ≤ 0.05) concentrations of urea N in plasma compared with pigs fed LF diets, but dietary fiber and DFM had no effect on plasma concentration of TNF-ɑ.

"29551457","abstracttext_purpose","Muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) regulate a number of important physiological functions. Alteration of mAChR expression or function has been associated in the etiology of several pathologies including functional bladder disorders (e.g bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis - BPS/IC). In a previous study we found specific mAChR expression patterns associated with BPS/IC, while correlation between protein and gene expression was lacking. Posttranslational regulatory mechanisms, e.g. altered intracellular receptor trafficking, could explain those differences. In addition, alternative G protein (GP) coupling could add to the pathophysiology via modulation of muscarinic signaling. In our proof-of-principle study, we addressed these questions in situ. We established PLA in combination with confocal laserscanning microscopy (CLSM) and 3D object reconstruction for highly specific detection and analysis of muscarinic 3 receptors (M3), G protein (GP) coupling and intracellular trafficking in human detrusor samples."

"30769665","articletitle","First Report of Leaf Smut on Fescue (Festuca rubra) Caused by Urocystis agropyri in Interior Alaska."
"30769665","abstracttext","In June and early July of 2003 and July of 2007, a smut disease was found on fescue (Festuca rubra L.) at the Fairbanks Golf and Country Club and vicinities, Interior Alaska. Diseased plants were pale green-to-slightly yellow and stunted. The lesions were long, narrow, yellowish green streaks parallel to the veins of leaves and sheaths. At a later stage, sori developed under the epidermis and the leaves and sheaths turned silvery gray. Rupture of the epidermis resulted in the release of masses of black spores that covered the leaves, especially along and within infected sheaths. Microscopic observation showed spore balls consisting of one-to-four, dark reddish brown teliospores surrounded by small, hyaline-to-light brown sterile cells. The spore balls were globose to elongate and 16 to 32 × 18 to 38 μm. The teliospores were globose, dark reddish brown, and 7.5 to 20 μm in diameter. Urocystis agropyri is recognized by R. W. Smiley et al. (2) and J. D. Smith et al. (3) as occurring on turf grasses; K. Vánky (4) restricts this species to Elymus spp. and recognizes U. ulei as the valid species infecting Festuca spp, including F. rubra. On the basis of host symptoms and morphology of spores, the smut found on F. rubra in Alaska fits better with published descriptions of U. agropyri (Preuss) Schrot (2,3), however, it likely is not conspecific with flag smut of wheat. For molecular verification of this identification, DNA was isolated from teliospores with a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Primers were designed for amplification of the large subunit ribosomal gene based on the only two published sequences of U. ranunculi (Lib.) Moesz (GenBank Accession No. AF009879) and U. colchici (Schltdl.) Rabenh (GenBank Accession No. AF009878) (1). A 400-bp PCR product was amplified by the forward primer 3'-GCATTGTAAACTCAGAAGTGTTATCCG-5' and reverse primer 5'-TTCCCTAAACCTATATCCGGCG-3'. Nucleotide sequence of the PCR product (GenBank Accession No. AY547283) shared 97.7% homology with U. ranunculi and 98.2% with U. colchici. Comparison of nucleotide sequences will be more meaningful in the identification of species of Urocystis when additional sequences are published. To our knowledge, this is the first report of U. agropyri from turfgrass in Alaska. References: (1) D. Begerow et al. Can. J. Bot. 75:2045, 1997. (2) R. W. Smiley et al.

"32191715","abstracttext","The flag leaf is the main organ of photosynthesis during grain-filling period of wheat, and flag leaf-related traits affect plant morphology and yield potential. In this study, two BC3F6 introgression line (IL) populations derived from the common recipient parent Lumai 14 with Jing 411 and Shaanhan 8675, respectively, were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flag leaf length (FLL), flag leaf width (FLW), flag leaf area (FLA) and chlorophyll content (CC) at flowering stage and 15 and 20 days after anthesis (DAA) in 2016-2017 (E1) and 2017-2018 (E2) two environments. A total of 14 and 15 QTLs for flag leaf-related traits were detected in Lumai 14 / Jing 411 and Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 populations, respectively. Among them, Both QFLW-6A and QFLA-6A were detected in Lumai 14 / Jing 411 population under E2 and in Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 population under E1 and E2 environments, respectively. QCCS2-3A from Lumai 14 / Jing 411 population and QCCS3-1A, QFLL-4A and QFLL-6A from Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 population were repeatedly identified under two tested environments. Moreover, eight QTL clusters controlling flag leaf-related traits were identified, which provided a genetic basis for significant correlations in phenotype among these traits. On the other hand, positive alleles of QFLW-6A for FLW detected in two populations were derived from their donors. Eighteen lines and 44 lines carried this QTL were found in Lumai 14 / Jing 411 and Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 populations, respectively. The means of FLW in these lines were wider than that of the recipient parent, Lumai 14, in two environments, suggesting that QFLW-6A played an important role for increasing FLW. The IL 124 in Lumai 14 / Jing 411 population and the IL 59 and IL 127 in Lumai 14 / Shaanhan 8675 population had five, five and four donor chromosomal segments which carried no other QTL controlling FLW than QFLW-6A, respectively. And the FLWs of these lines were significantly greater than that of Lumai 14 under two environments. So these lines and their donor parent can be regarded as potential near-isogenic lines. Further, a synteny analysis found QFLW-6A was near the 574,283,851-574,283,613 bp fragment on chromosome 6A and 10 genes were in the range of 500 kb upstream and downstream of the fragment. These results provide the basis for identification of candidate gene and map-based cloning and functional verification of the QTL."
"32194522","articletitle","Comparative Genome Analysis of the Lignocellulose Degrading Bacteria Citrobacter freundii so4 and Sphingobacterium multivorum w15."
"32194522","abstracttext","Two bacterial strains, denoted so4 and w15, isolated from wheat straw (WS)-degrading microbial consortia, were found to grow synergistically in media containing WS as the single carbon and energy source. They were identified as Citrobacter freundii so4 and Sphingobacterium multivorum w15 based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing and comparison to the respective C. freundii and S. multivorum type strains. In order to identify the mechanisms driving the synergistic interactions, we analyzed the draft genomes of the two strains and further characterized their metabolic potential. The latter analyses revealed that the strains had largely complementary substrate utilization patterns, with only 22 out of 190 compounds shared. The analyses further indicated C. freundii so4 to primarily consume amino acids and simple sugars, with laminarin as a key exception. In contrast, S. multivorum w15 showed ample capacity to transform complex polysaccharides, including intermediates of starch degradation. Sequence analyses revealed C. freundii so4 to have a genome of 4,883,214 bp, with a G + C content of 52.5%, 4,554 protein-encoding genes and 86 RNA genes. S. multivorum w15 has a genome of 6,678,278 bp, with a G + C content of 39.7%, 5,999 protein-encoding genes and 76 RNA genes. Genes for motility apparatuses (flagella, chemotaxis) were present in the genome of C. freundii so4, but absent from that of S. multivorum w15. In the genome of S. multivorum w15, 348 genes had regions matching CAZy family enzymes and/or carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), with 193 glycosyl hydrolase (GH) and 50 CBM domains. Remarkably, 22 domains matched enzymes of glycoside hydrolase family GH43, suggesting a strong investment in the degradation of arabinoxylan. In contrast, 130 CAZy family genes were found in C. freundii so4, with 61 GH and 12 CBM domains identified. Collectively, our results, based on both metabolic potential and genome analyses, revealed the two strains to harbor complementary catabolic armories, with S. multivorum w15 primarily attacking the WS hemicellulose and C. freundii so4 the cellobiose derived from cellulose, next to emerging oligo- or monosaccharides. Finally, C. freundii so4 may secrete secondary metabolites that S. multivorum w15 can consume, and detoxify the system by reducing the levels of (toxic) by-products."
"30108170","articletitle","Developmental Dynamics of Long Noncoding RNA Expression during Sexual Fruiting Body Formation in Fusarium graminearum."
"30108170","abstracttext","Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) plays important roles in sexual development in eukaryotes. In filamentous fungi, however, little is known about the expression and roles of lncRNAs during fruiting body formation. By profiling developmental transcriptomes during the life cycle of the plant-pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum , we identified 547 lncRNAs whose expression was highly dynamic, with about 40% peaking at the meiotic stage. Many lncRNAs were found to be antisense to mRNAs, forming 300 sense-antisense pairs. Although small RNAs were produced from these overlapping loci, antisense lncRNAs appeared not to be involved in gene silencing pathways. Genome-wide analysis of small RNA clusters identified many silenced loci at the meiotic stage. However, we found transcriptionally active small RNA clusters, many of which were associated with lncRNAs. Also, we observed that many antisense lncRNAs and their respective sense transcripts were induced in parallel as the fruiting bodies matured. The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway is known to determine the fates of lncRNAs as well as mRNAs. Thus, we analyzed mutants defective in NMD and identified a subset of lncRNAs that were induced during sexual development but suppressed by NMD during vegetative growth. These results highlight the developmental stage-specific nature and functional potential of lncRNA expression in shaping the fungal fruiting bodies and provide fundamental resources for studying sexual stage-induced lncRNAs. IMPORTANCE Fusarium graminearum is the causal agent of the head blight on our major staple crops, wheat and corn. The fruiting body formation on the host plants is indispensable for the disease cycle and epidemics. Long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) molecules are emerging as key regulatory components for sexual development in animals and plants. To date, however, there is a paucity of information on the roles of lncRNAs in fungal fruiting body formation. Here we characterized hundreds of lncRNAs that exhibited developmental stage-specific expression patterns during fruiting body formation. Also, we discovered that many lncRNAs were induced in parallel with their overlapping transcripts on the opposite DNA strand during sexual development. Finally, we found a subset of lncRNAs that were regulated by an RNA surveillance system during vegetative growth. This research provides fundamental genomic resources that will spur further investigations on lncRNAs that may play important roles in shaping fungal fruiting bodies."
"30087681","articletitle","Development of PSP1, a Biostimulant Based on the Elicitor AsES for Disease Management in Monocot and Dicot Crops."
"30087681","abstracttext","In this work, we present a novel biostimulant for sustainable crop disease management, PSP1, based on the plant defense-elicitor AsES, an extracellular protease produced by the strawberry fungal pathogen Acremonium strictum . Fungal fermentation conditions and downstream processing were determined to maximize extracellular protein production, product stability and a high plant defense-eliciting activity, as monitored by anthracnose resistance in supernatant-treated strawberry plants subsequently infected with a virulent strain of Colletotrichum acutatum . Fermentation batches were shown to reduce anthracnose development by 30-60% as compared to infected non-treated plants. Product formulation was shown to be stable for 6 months when stored at temperatures up to 45°C and toxicological tests showed that PSP1 was harmless to beneficial organisms and non-toxic to mammalian species at concentrations 50 times higher than those used in plant experiments. Furthermore, disease protection studies using dilutions of PSP1 indicated that there is a minimum threshold protease activity needed to induce pathogen defense in strawberry and that this induction effect is dose-independent. A significant characteristic of PSP1 is its broad-range protection against different diseases in various crop species. In soybean, PSP1 reduced the symptomatology by 70% of Corynespora cassiicola , etiological agent of the target spot. This protection effect was similar to the commercial inducer BION 500 WG based on BTH, and both products were shown to induce an oxidative burst and up-regulated PR1 -gene expression in soybean. Furthermore, a double PSP1-treatment on greenhouse-grown sugarcane plants provided protection against bacterial red stripe disease caused by Acidovorax avenae and a double foliar application of PSP1 on field-grown wheat plants significantly increased resistance against Fusarium graminearum , causal agent of head blight disease, manifested mainly in an increased seed germination rate. In summary, these disease protection studies demonstrated an effective control against both bacterial and fungal pathogens in both monocot and dicot crop species, which together with its low production cost, effectiveness at low concentrations, long shelf-life, tolerance to high temperatures, harmlessness to non-target organisms and simple handling and application, make PSP1 a very promising candidate for effective and sustainable disease management in many crop species."
"30754602","articletitle","First Report of Plasmodiophora brassicae on Rapeseed in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg."
"30754602","abstracttext","Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is the third most important crop after wheat and barley in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Since 2005, clubroot symptoms in this crop have been reported by farmers in the Gutland Region. In February 2009, plants of the hybrid rapeseed cv. Exocet, with stunted growth, yellow leaves, and club-shaped roots, were sampled from a field in Oberkorn village near Differdange. Microscopic observations of the rapeseed root fragments revealed the presence of the three life stages characteristic of Plasmodiophora brassicae Woronin. Plasmodia and zoosporangia were observed in the root hairs and resting spores were present in root galls. Individual spores were 2 to 3 μm in diameter. Total DNA was extracted from the root galls with a FAST DNA Kit (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and 5.8S gene of the rDNA region were amplified with ITS5 and ITS4 primers as described by White et al. (2) and part of this region was sequenced. A BLASTn search in GenBank revealed that the sequence closely resembled (98% identity) sequences of P. brassicae (Genbank Accession No. EF195335) from an isolate of the pathogen from Switzerland. To confirm the presence of the pathogen, seeds of the susceptible ecotype cvi-0 of Arabidopsis thaliana were grown in a soil sample (1 liter) collected near the infected rapeseed plants. After 55 days of growth in a glasshouse at 15 to 20°C, the roots of 11 plants were analyzed. Two showed clear clubroot symptoms and four others exhibited small swellings. The remaining five plants were symptomless, but plasmodia and zoosporangia were found in root hair cells. Clubroot caused by P. brassicae has previously been described on B. napus and other crucifers (1). To our knowledge, this is the first report of clubroot disease caused by P. brassicae in Luxembourg. Because its presence has since been observed in new fields in the Gutland Region and because of the ability of the pathogen to survive for a long period in the soil, this disease could represent a severe threat for cropping of Brassicaceae in Luxembourg and neighboring countries.

"30727410","articletitle","First Report of Lavender Wilt Caused by Fusarium sporotrichioides in Croatia."
"30727410","abstracttext","In May 2011, samples of lavender plants (Lavandula × intermedia) showing wilt symptoms were collected from two commercial plantings in Slavonia County. Disease was observed on 20 to 30% of the plants. Symptoms of the disease consisted of chlorosis, stunting, wilting, and death. Vascular tissue of stems and roots exhibited brown discoloration. Isolations of the pathogen were made from the discolored tissues on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Colonies were initially white, but with age became red, and red pigments were produced in agar. Microconidia were pear shaped, oval, and fusoid, and ranged from 4.5 to 14.0 × 2.8 to 4.7 μm. Macroconidia were curved, mostly three septate, and ranged from 21.8 to 24.3 × 2.9 to 3.9 μm. Morphology of colonies and conidia matched the description of Fusarium sporotrichioides Sherb. (1). Identity of the fungus was confirmed by examining a portion of the EF1-α gene using the degenerated primers EF1 and EF2 (2). BLAST searches of the obtained sequences showed a 100% homology with several isolates of F. sporotrichioides from GenBank. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on 20 4-month-old rooted cuttings under greenhouse conditions. Each plant was planted in a separate pot containing 0.7 liter of sterile soil. Inoculum for artificial infection was prepared with sterilized mixtures of wheat and barley seeds (10 g of each). Seeds were inoculated with a F. sporotrichioides spore suspension (10 6 conidia/ml) and incubated at 22°C for 10 days. Noninoculated seeds served as controls. Ten seeds were placed under the soil surface around the root of each plant. Plants were irrigated and placed in a greenhouse (22°C and a 12-h day/night photoperiod). Sixteen days after inoculation, 80% of inoculated plants were wilted. Symptoms on infected plants were similar to those observed in the field. The pathogen was reisolated and confirmed from the infected vascular tissue, thus fulfilling Koch's postulates. A previous paper reported lavender as host of F. solani in China (4) and F. oxysporum in Saudi Arabia (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of Fusarium wilt of lavender caused by F. sporotrichioides. References: (1) J. F. Leslie and B. A. Summerell. Page 256 in: The Fusarium Laboratory Manual.

"30590571","articletitle","Exogenous carbohydrases added to a starter diet reduced markers of systemic immune activation and decreased Lactobacillus in weaned pigs1."
"30590571","abstracttext","Although the impact of carbohydrases on performance and nutrient utilization has been well studied, their effects on immune status and intestinal microbiota are less known in pigs. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of xylanase (X) and a carbohydrase enzyme blend (EB; cellulase, ß-glucanase, and xylanase) on the immune profile of the intestine and peripheral system as well as intestinal microbes and microbial metabolites of weaned pigs fed higher fiber diets. Pigs (n = 460; 6.43 ± 0.06 kg BW; F25 × 6.0 Genetiporc) were blocked by initial BW. Pens (n = 48; 12 per treatment; 9 or 10 pigs per pen) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dietary treatments, including a higher fiber control diet (CON) and the CON supplemented with 0.01% X, 0.01% EB, or both enzymes (X + EB), arranged in a 2 × 2 factorial. The diets were based on corn, soybean meal, corn distillers dried grains with solubles, and wheat middlings. After 7-d adaptation to the environment, pigs were fed experimental diets ad libitum for 28 d. Blood samples were collected from the same pig within each pen on days 0, 7, 14, and 28. Intestinal tissues and digesta were collected on day 28. Bacteria 16S rRNA gene copy numbers were quantified using qPCR. The mRNA levels of colonic IL-17, occludin (OCLN), and claudin 3 (CLDN3) were greater in pigs fed diets with X + EB, but not X or EB, compared with those fed CON (P < 0.05). The EB in the diet reduced plasma IL-8 over the 28-d trial compared with diets without EB (P < 0.05). There was an X × EB interaction on plasma tumor necrosis factor α and IL-1ß (P < 0.05); their levels were decreased when X and EB were added together, but not individually, compared with CON. The EB decreased cecal propionate, butyrate, and total volatile fatty acids (P < 0.05). Pigs fed X had lower ileal Lactobacillus and greater ileal and cecal Enterobacteriaceae compared with those fed unsupplemented diets (P < 0.05). The EB decreased Lactobacillus (P < 0.05) and tended to decrease (P = 0.065) Enterobacteriaceae in the colon compared with diets without EB. In conclusion, the addition of X and EB together decreased systemic markers of immune activation, potentially diverting energy and nutrients towards growth. The EB reduced colonic Lactobacillus and cecal total volatile fatty acids, probably due to improved prececal fiber and starch degradation and thus reduced substrate availability in the large intestine. These data corroborated previously observed enhanced growth in pigs fed EB-supplemented diets."
"30591335","articletitle","Estimation of correction factors to determine the true amino acid concentration of protein after a 24-hour hydrolysis."
"30591335","abstracttext","Although it has been acknowledged for a long time that a single period of hydrolysis, normally 21 to 24 h, is not the optimal time for most of the AA, a single period is routinely used due to time and cost constraints. As models to balance dairy rations for proteins are evolving toward balancing for AA, it becomes critical to improve the predictions of AA supply from digested proteins. Our objective was to develop correction factors that could systematically be applied to AA concentrations obtained after a 24-h hydrolysis of proteins to account for incomplete recovery and therefore determine their true AA composition. Thirteen substrates were selected to represent different types of proteins commonly used to estimate the supply of AA in ration formulation models: feed ingredients (grass silage, corn silage, soybean meal, canola meal, high-protein corn dried distillers grains, and wheat dried distillers grains plus solubles), 16-h rumen residues (soybean meal and canola meal), digesta (duodenal digesta and feces), and rumen microorganisms (fluid-associated bacteria, particle-associated bacteria and protozoa). Each protein was hydrolyzed in 6 N HCl for multiple hydrolysis times: 13 (2, 4, 8, 12, 18, 21, 24, 30, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 168 h) for feed ingredients, rumen residues, and digesta, and 9 (2, 4, 8, 18, 24, 30, 48, 96, and 168 h) for rumen microorganisms; all analyses were conducted in triplicate. Using nonlinear regression, the AA composition in the protein before the hydrolysis (A 0 ) was derived for each AA in each protein. Two ratios were calculated as potential correction factors: A 0 /24-h concentration (A 0 /24h) and the maximal concentration/24-h concentration (max/24h). Both ratios were tested to determine if the type of proteins was affecting them. The ratios A 0 /24h were not affected by the type of proteins, whereas the ratios max/24h were also not affected by the type of proteins except for 3 nonessential AA (Ala, Glu, and Gly). In an attempt to propose correction factors, our results were combined with results from the literature reporting ratios A 0 /24h, ratios max/24h, or the ratio of the AA composition calculated from gene structure/24 h. The correction factors proposed for individual AA varied from 1.02 (Asp) to 1.12 (Thr). For the essential AA, the highest ratios were obtained, as expected, for the branched-chain AA and Thr. Formulation programs balancing dairy rations for essential AA would need to acknowledge the incomplete recovery of AA when obtained from 24-h hydrolysis and include correction factors, specific for each AA, but the same across different types of proteins, to correctly estimate the true AA supply to dairy cows."

"31602304","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to determine the effect of different stocker management programs on skeletal muscle development and growth characteristics, satellite cell (SC) activity in growing-finishing beef cattle as well as the effects of SC-conditioned media on preadipocyte gene expression and differentiation. Fall-weaned Angus steers (n = 76; 258 ± 28 kg) were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 stocker production systems: 1) grazing dormant native range (NR) supplemented with a 40% CP cottonseed meal-based supplement (1.02 kg · steer -1 · d -1 ) followed by long-season summer grazing (CON, 0.46 kg/d); 2) grazing dormant NR supplemented with a ground corn and soybean meal-based supplement fed at 1% of BW followed by short-season summer grazing (CORN, 0.61 kg/d); 3) grazing winter wheat pasture (WP) at high stocking density (3.21 steers/ha) to achieve a moderate rate of gain (LGWP, 0.83 kg/d); and 4) grazing winter WP at low stocking density (0.99 steers/ha) to achieve a high rate of gain (HGWP, 1.29 kg/d). At the end of the stocker (intermediate harvest, IH) and finishing (final harvest, FH) phases, 4 steers / treatment were harvested and longissimus muscles (LM) sampled for cryohistological immunofluorescence analysis and SC culture assays. At IH, WP steers had greater LM fiber cross-sectional area than NR steers; however, at FH, the opposite was observed ( p < 0.0001). At IH, CORN steers had the lowest Myf-5+:Pax7+ SC density ( p = 0.020), while LGWP steers had the most Pax7+ SC ( p = 0.043). At FH, CON steers had the highest LM capillary density ( p = 0.003) and their cultured SC differentiated more readily than all other treatments ( p = 0.017). At FH, Pax7 mRNA was more abundant in 14 d-old SC cultures from HGWP cattle ( p = 0.03). Preadipocytes exposed to culture media from proliferating SC cultures from WP cattle isolated at FH had more PPARγ ( p = 0.037) and less FABP4 ( p = 0.030) mRNA expression compared with NR cattle. These data suggest that different stocker management strategies can impact skeletal muscle growth, SC function, and potentially impact marbling development in growing-finishing beef cattle."
"32978122","articletitle","Synergistic Action of a Lytic Polysaccharide Monooxygenase and a Cellobiohydrolase from Penicillium funiculosum in Cellulose Saccharification under High-Level Substrate Loading."
"32978122","abstracttext","Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are crucial industrial enzymes required in the biorefinery industry as well as in the natural carbon cycle. These enzymes, known to catalyze the oxidative cleavage of glycosidic bonds, are produced by numerous bacterial and fungal species to assist in the degradation of cellulosic biomass. In this study, we annotated and performed structural analysis of an uncharacterized LPMO from Penicillium funiculosum (PfLPMO9) based on computational methods in an attempt to understand the behavior of this enzyme in biomass degradation. PfLPMO9 exhibited 75% and 36% sequence identities with LPMOs from Thermoascus aurantiacus (TaLPMO9A) and Lentinus similis (LsLPMO9A), respectively. Furthermore, multiple fungal genetic manipulation tools were employed to simultaneously overexpress LPMO and cellobiohydrolase I (CBH1) in a catabolite-derepressed strain of Penicillium funiculosum , Pf Mig1 88 (an engineered variant of P. funiculosum ), to improve its saccharification performance toward acid-pretreated wheat straw (PWS) at 20% substrate loading. The resulting transformants showed improved LPMO and CBH1 expression at both the transcriptional and translational levels, with ∼200% and ∼66% increases in ascorbate-induced LPMO and Avicelase activities, respectively. While the secretome of Pf Mig 88 overexpressing LPMO or CBH1 increased the saccharification of PWS by 6% or 13%, respectively, over the secretome of Pf Mig1 88 at the same protein concentration, the simultaneous overexpression of these two genes led to a 20% increase in saccharification efficiency over that observed with Pf Mig1 88 , which accounted for 82% saccharification of PWS under 20% substrate loading. IMPORTANCE The enzymatic hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass by cellulases continues to be a significant bottleneck in the development of second-generation biobased industries. While increasing efforts are being made to obtain indigenous cellulases for biomass hydrolysis, the high production cost of this enzyme remains a crucial challenge affecting its wide availability for the efficient utilization of cellulosic materials. This is because it is challenging to obtain an enzymatic cocktail with balanced activity from a single host. This report describes the annotation and structural analysis of an uncharacterized lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO) gene in Penicillium funiculosum and its impact on biomass deconstruction upon overexpression in a catabolite-derepressed strain of P. funiculosum Cellobiohydrolase I (CBH1), which is the most important enzyme produced by many cellulolytic fungi for the saccharification of crystalline cellulose, was further overexpressed simultaneously with LPMO. The resulting secretome was analyzed for enhanced LPMO and exocellulase activities and the corresponding improvement in saccharification performance (by ∼20%) under high-level substrate loading using a minimal amount of protein."
"19475440","articletitle","Farmer knowledge and a priori risk analysis: pre-release evaluation of genetically modified Roundup Ready wheat across the Canadian prairies."
"19475440","abstracttext_background, aim, and scope","The controversy over the world's first genetically modified (GM) wheat, Roundup Ready wheat (RRW), challenged the efficacy of 'science-based' risk assessment, largely because it excluded the public, particularly farmers, from meaningful input. Risk analysis, in contrast, is broader in orientation as it incorporates scientific data as well as socioeconomic, ethical, and legal concerns, and considers expert and lay input in decision-making. Local knowledge (LK) of farmers is experience-based and represents a rich and reliable source of information regarding the impacts associated with agricultural technology, thereby complementing the scientific data normally used in risk assessment. The overall goal of this study was to explore the role of farmer LK in the a priori risk analysis of RRW."
"19475440","abstracttext_materials and methods","In 2004, data were collected from farmers using mail surveys sent across the three prairie provinces (i.e., Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta) in western Canada. A stratified random sampling approach was used whereby four separate sampling districts were identified in regions where wheat was grown for each province. Rural post offices were randomly selected in each sampling district using Canada Post databases such that no one post office exceeded 80 farms and that each sampling district comprised 225-235 test farms (n = 11,040). In total, 1,814 people responded, representing an adjusted response rate for farmers of 33%. A subsequent telephone survey showed there was no non-response bias."
"19475440","abstracttext_results","The primary benefits associated with RRW were associated with weed control, whereas risks emphasized the importance of market harm, corporate control, agronomic problems, and the likelihood of contamination. Overall, risks were ranked much higher than benefits, and the great majority of farmers were highly critical of RRW commercialization. In total, 83.2% of respondents disagreed that RRW should have unconfined release into the environment. Risk was associated with distrust in government and corporations, previous experience with GM canola, and a strong belief in the importance of community and environment. Farmers were critical of expert-based risk assessment, particularly RRW field trials, and believed that their LK was valuable for assessing agbiotechnology as a whole."
"19475440","abstracttext_discussion","Over 90% of canola production across the Canadian prairies makes use of herbicide-tolerant (HT) varieties. Yet, respondents were generally uniform in their criticism of RRW, regardless whether they were HT users, non-HT-users, conservation tillage or organic in approach. They had a sophisticated understanding of how GM trait confinement was intrinsically tied to grain system segregation and, ultimately, market accessibility, and were concerned that gene flow in RRW would not be contained. Organic farmers were particularly critical of RRW, in large part because certification standards prohibit the presence of GM traits. Farmers practicing conservation tillage were also at relatively great risk, in part because their dependence on glyphosate to control weeds increases the likelihood that RRW volunteer would become more difficult and costly to control."
"19475440","abstracttext_conclusions","This research is the first of its kind to include farmer knowledge in the a priori risk analysis of GM crops and, arguably, given its prairie-wide scope, is the largest scale, independent-farmer-focused study on GM crops ever conducted. The surprising uniformity in attitudes between users and non-users of GM technology and among organic, conventional, conservation tillage and GM using farmers speaks to the ability of farmers to discriminate among HT varieties. Our results clearly show that prairie farmers recognize that the risks associated with RRW commercialization outweigh any benefits."
"19475440","abstracttext_recommendations and perspectives","Farmer knowledge systems are holistic in nature, incorporating socioeconomic, cultural, political, and agroecological factors that all can contribute meaningfully to the pre-release evaluation of GM crops. The inclusion of farmers and other stakeholders in risk assessment will also help enhance and even restore public confidence in science-focused approaches to risk assessment. Although farmers are highly knowledgeable regarding RRW and arguably any agricultural technology, their expertise continues to be overlooked by decision-makers and regulators across North America."

"33090068","abstracttext","Bletilla striata (Thunb.) Rchb.f. (Orchidaceae family, known as Baiji in Chinese) is an endangered plant species with important medicinal value in China. Bletilla striata plants with symptoms of wilting, leaf yellowing and rotting on underground parts were found in Shizong (24.82822 N; 103.99084 E), Yunnan Province, China in July 2016. In the following years, this disease occurred and became prevalent when high temperature and high humidity prevailed in the fields from May to August. The incidence of the disease varied from 45 to 75%, with yield losses of 40 to 65% in different B. striata fields. To identify the causal agent of the disease, symptomatic vascular tissue fragments were soaked in 2% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, rinsed twice with sterile distilled water, and then placed on 4% (w/v) potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. The plates were incubated at 26°C in 12h light/dark for three days. Mycelia grown from the edges of the plant fragments were transferred to PDA plates and incubated at 26°C in 12h light/dark. After three days, hyphal tips were isolated from the edge of the colonies to PDA plates. Three hyphal-tip isolates from different plants were further studied. The colonies of these three isolates were dark red, with cottony mycelia of moderate density. Hyphae were transparent and branched. Numerous hyphae anastomosed frequently and formed hyphal coils. For further morphological analysis, sporulation was induced as described by Cabral et al. (2012) and Lombard et al. (2014). Macroconidia were abundant, 37.2 to 44.0 µm × 5.2 to 8.7 µm based on the measurement of 20 conidia from each isolate. Ascospores divided into two cells of equal size, ellipsoid to oblong-ellipsoid, 12.5 to 14.8 µm × 4.8 to 5.9 µm based on the measurement of 20 spores from each isolate. Conidiophores simple or complex, sporodochial. Simple conidiophores arising laterally or terminally from aerial mycelium, solitary to loosely aggregated, unbranched or sparsely brached, more or less cylindrical. These morphological characteristics were consistent with the description of Dactylonectria spp. by Cabral et al. (2012) and Lombard et al. (2014). From one isolate, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA and the beta-tubulin (tub2) gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990) and T1/Bt-2b (Cabral et al. 2012), respectively. PCR products were sequenced and deposited in GenBank with accession numbers MH458779 (ITS) and MH626485 (tub2). BLAST search revealed that both sequences showed 99 to 100% homology with the corresponding sequences of previously identified D. torresensis isolates. Specially, MH458779 shares 100% identity with the entire 463-base pair (bp) sequence of KP411806, the ITS sequence of a D. torresensis isolate identified from olive trees (Nigro et al. 2019); MH626485 shares 99% identity with the entire 320-bp sequence of KP411801, the tub2 sequence of the same olive tree isolate. In addition, the entire 609-bp sequence of MH626485 shares 99% identity with JF735478, the tub2 sequence of a D. torresensis isolate identified from grapevines (Cabral et al. 2012). To test the pathogenicity of the fungus, plants of B. striata in plastic pots filled with sterilized nursery soil were inoculated with each of the three isolates by placing a fungal-colonized wheat kernel adjacent to each health plant. Plants inoculated with noncolonized wheat kernels were used as controls. Plants in three pots (replicates), with one plant per pot, were inoculated by each isolate. The pots were maintained in a greenhouse with a 12h photoperiod at 25°C. Ten days after inoculation, black necrotic lesions identical to those observed in the field were evident on the roots of all inoculated plants. Using the same methods described above, fungi with identical morphologies as described above were isolated from lesions caused by each of the three isolates. The control plants remained healthy, and no fungus was re-isolated. This completed Koch's postulates. Based on the morphological characteristics and molecular identification, the pathogen was determined to be D. torresensis. To our knowledge, this is the first report of D. torresensis causing root rot of B. striata in Yunnan, China. It is important to further study the impacts of this new disease on B. striata production in China."

Wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1) has been studied extensively in the context of cancer and the regulation of different types of stem cells, but the role of Wip1 in cardiac adaptation to MI is unknown. We investigated the significance of Wip1 in a mouse model of MI."

We compared Wip1-knockout (Wip1-KO) mice and wild-type (WT) mice to determine changes in cardiac function and survival in response to MI. The heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratio and cardiac function were measured before MI. Mouse MI was established by ligating the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery under 1.5% isoflurane anesthesia. After MI, survival of the mice was observed for 4 weeks. Cardiac function was examined by echocardiography. The HW/BW ratio was analyzed, and cardiac hypertrophy was measured by wheat germ agglutinin staining. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining was used to determine the infarct size. Gene expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) was assessed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and the levels of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (stat3) and phosphor-stat3 (p-stat3) were also analyzed by Western blotting.

"30727547","abstracttext","Tedera (Bituminaria bituminosa (L.) C.H. Stirton var. albomarginata) has been successfully established across the mixed-farming (wheat-sheep) region of Western Australia because this species has remarkable drought tolerance and can survive the dry-summer period with strong retention of green leaf. A leaf spot symptom involving pale brown lesions with distinct dark brown margins had been observed in genetic evaluation plots of tedera at Medina and Mount Barker, Western Australia, and a Phoma sp. was isolated. Single-spore isolations of a typical Phoma sp. isolate were made onto potato dextrose agar and maintained at 20°C, and a representative culture has been lodged in the Western Australian Culture Collection Herbarium maintained at the Department of Agriculture and Food Western Australia (Accession No. WAC13435). Amplification of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 1 and ITS2 regions flanking the 5.8S rRNA gene were carried out with universal primers ITS1 and ITS4 according to published protocol (3). The DNA PCR products were sequenced and BLAST analyses was used to compare sequences with those in GenBank. The sequence had 99% nucleotide identity with the corresponding sequence in GenBank for Phoma herbarum. Isolates also showed morphological (e.g., 1) and molecular (e.g., 2) similarities with P. herbarum as described in other reports. The relevant sequence information for a representative isolate has been lodged in GenBank (Accession No. JQ282910). A conidial suspension of 10 7 conidia ml -1 from a single-spore culture was spray inoculated onto foliage of 6-week-old tedera plants maintained under >90% relative humidity conditions for 72-h postinoculation. Symptoms evident by 10 days postinoculation consisted of pale brown lesions, mostly 1.5 to 4 mm in diameter, which developed a distinct, dark brown margin. Occasional lesions also showed a distinct chlorotic halo extending 1 to 1.5 mm outside the boundary of the lesion. Infection studies were successfully repeated twice and P. herbarum was readily reisolated from infected foliage. No disease was observed on and no P. herbarum were isolated from water-inoculated control plants. Except for a recent published report of P. herbarum on field pea (Pisum sativum L.) (2), this pathogen has only been noted in the Australian Plant Pest Database as occurring on lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) and soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) in Western Australia in 1985 and on a Protea sp. in 1991. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of P. herbarum as a pathogen on tedera in Australia or elsewhere. That P. herbarum occurs on other hosts in Australia and has a wide host range elsewhere together suggest its potential to be a pathogen on a wider range of host genera and species. References: (1) G.

"30743343","abstracttext","A research program was initiated at the University of Georgia in 2003 to identify banana cultivars suitable for production in the coastal and southern areas of the state. During a root disease survey conducted in October 2007 on bananas (Musa spp.) grown at the University of Georgia Bamboo Farm and Coastal Gardens in Savannah, GA, root lesions and root rot were observed on banana cvs. Gold Finger, Kandarian, and Manzano. Root lesions were dark brown to black and irregular in shape, with partial or entire roots affected. Lateral roots and outer layers of cord roots (roots arising from interior layers of the corm) of infected plants were blackened and rotted. Diseased root samples were collected from three plants of each cultivar, surface sterilized with 0.6% sodium hypochlorite, and placed on tannic acid benomyl agar (TABA). Pure cultures of the fungus consistently associated with diseased tissue were obtained by subculturing hyphal tips on TABA. Mycelia of the fungus on potato dextrose agar (PDA) were light to deep brown and the hyphae tended to branch at right angles. A septum was present in each hyphal branch near the point of origin and a slight constriction at the branch was observed. The hyphae of two isolates were stained with 0.6% phenosafranin and 3% KOH and binucleate hyphal cells were observed. On the basis of these morphological features, the isolates appeared to be binucleate Rhizoctonia anamorphs (teleomorph Ceratobasidium Rogers). For molecular identification, the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions and the 5.8S gene from rDNA of the isolates were cloned and sequenced (GenBank Accession No. HQ168370). The ITS regions (775 bp) were 100% identical between the two isolates and 99% identical to Ceratobasidium sp. AG-F strain SIR-1 isolated from sweet potato in Japan (GenBank Accession No. AF354085). The anastomosis group of the isolates was confirmed by pairing with strain SIR-1 on PDA. On the basis of morphological and molecular characteristics and the anastomosis assay, the two isolates were identified as a Ceratobasidium sp. AG-F (1-3). Pathogenicity assays were conducted by inoculating banana plants (cv. Golden pillow, synonym = Manzano) grown in pots under greenhouse conditions (25 to 27°C). Twenty wheat seeds infested with each isolate were placed uniformly around each plant at a depth of 10 cm in the soil. The plants were incubated in the greenhouse and the roots were examined 2 months after inoculation. Brown-to-black lesions and root rot, identical to symptoms associated with field banana roots, were observed on all inoculated plants but not on the noninoculated control plants. The fungus was reisolated from affected root samples and the identity was confirmed by morphological and molecular characteristics and the anastomosis assay. To our knowledge, this is the first report of banana root rot caused by binucleate Rhizoctonia anastomosis group F. With the increased interest in producing bananas for food and ornamental purposes, the occurrence of Ceratobasidium root rot on bananas needs to be considered when designing disease management programs and searching for suitable cultivars for banana production.

"30722393","articletitle","First Report of Fusarium Wilt of Tobacco Caused by Fusarium kyushuense in China."
"30722393","abstracttext","Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) is a leafy, annual, solanaceous plant grown commercially for its leaves. China accounts for more than 39.6% of total global tobacco production (3). In May 2012, seedlings of tobacco cv. Honghuadajinyuan in a Guiyang tobacco commercial field (Guizhou, China, 26.35° N, 106.42° E) developed symptoms of severe wilting, chlorosis, and stunting. The main stem and taproot exhibited reddish to light brown vascular discoloration; further progression of these symptoms eventually caused mortality of infected seedlings. To isolate the causal agent, necrotic tissues from the symptomatic root were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C in darkness. Colonies with white to rose mycelia and red-brown colony colors developed on PDA after 5 days of incubation. Microconidia were abundant, straight or slightly curved, clavate, 0- to 3-septate, and 7.5 to 20.0 × 2.5 to 5.0 μm. Macroconidia were straight or slightly curved, slender, 3- to 5-septate, and 25.0 to 45.0 × 3.3 to 5.0 μm. Based on the observed colony attributes, growth patterns, absence of chlamydospores, micro- and macro-spore attributes (1), and PCR amplification (using primers ITS1/4) combined with translation elongation factor primers (EF1/2) (2), the fungus was identified as F. kyushuense O'Donnell & T. Aoki. Sequence of ITS1-5.8s-ITS2 region of rDNA (GenBank Accession No. JX235957) exactly matched the sequences of F. kyushuense accession AB587020.1 (100% similarity). Analysis of the elongation factor (EF-1alpha) gene of the fungus (JX658565) resulted in a 99% match for F. kyushuense accession AB674297.1. Pathogenicity of the fungus was confirmed by performing Koch's postulate as follows. Pure cultures of the fungus F. kyushuense obtained from symptomatic tissues of tobacco seedlings were grown on PDA for 6 days. Tobacco plants to be used in pathogenicity tests were germinated and grown on potting soils in a plastic container. Additional fertilization was supplied by adding 0.2 g/L of 20-20-20 (N-P-K) in the float water. When seedlings got 6-leaf stage, they were ready for pathogenicity tests. Spores harvested from these culture plates were suspended in sterile distilled water, adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 10 4 conidia/ml, and inoculated by irrigating 10 ml of the conidia suspension onto roots of each of the 12 tobacco seedlings with 6-leaf stage. A group of 12 seedlings of the same age treated with sterile water served as control. Inoculated seedlings were maintained at 25°C, 100 μE m -2. s -1 , relative humidity >70%, and 16 h light per day, and monitored for 9 days for symptom development. Seedlings inoculated with conidia developed disease symptoms with roots with vascular discoloration of roots whereas control seedlings remained symptomless. F. kyushuense was reisolated from the symptomatic seedlings 9 days after inoculation. F. kyushuense has also been isolated from rice seeds in China (4), and from diseased wheat in Japan (1). The common tobacco Fusarium disease reported in China was caused by F. oxysporium f. sp. nicotianae. However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of F. kyushuense causing wilt on tobacco in China and the disease must be considered in existing disease management practices.

"20078771","abstracttext_unlabelled","Maize streak virus (MSV; Genus Mastrevirus, Family Geminiviridae) occurs throughout Africa, where it causes what is probably the most serious viral crop disease on the continent. It is obligately transmitted by as many as six leafhopper species in the Genus Cicadulina, but mainly by C. mbila Naudé and C. storeyi. In addition to maize, it can infect over 80 other species in the Family Poaceae. Whereas 11 strains of MSV are currently known, only the MSV-A strain is known to cause economically significant streak disease in maize. Severe maize streak disease (MSD) manifests as pronounced, continuous parallel chlorotic streaks on leaves, with severe stunting of the affected plant and, usuallly, a failure to produce complete cobs or seed. Natural resistance to MSV in maize, and/or maize infections caused by non-maize-adapted MSV strains, can result in narrow, interrupted streaks and no obvious yield losses. MSV epidemiology is primarily governed by environmental influences on its vector species, resulting in erratic epidemics every 3-10 years. Even in epidemic years, disease incidences can vary from a few infected plants per field, with little associated yield loss, to 100% infection rates and complete yield loss."
"20078771","abstracttext_taxonomy","The only virus species known to cause MSD is MSV, the type member of the Genus Mastrevirus in the Family Geminiviridae. In addition to the MSV-A strain, which causes the most severe form of streak disease in maize, 10 other MSV strains (MSV-B to MSV-K) are known to infect barley, wheat, oats, rye, sugarcane, millet and many wild, mostly annual, grass species. Seven other mastrevirus species, many with host and geographical ranges partially overlapping those of MSV, appear to infect primarily perennial grasses."
"20078771","abstracttext_physical properties","MSV and all related grass mastreviruses have single-component, circular, single-stranded DNA genomes of approximately 2700 bases, encapsidated in 22 x 38-nm geminate particles comprising two incomplete T = 1 icosahedra, with 22 pentameric capsomers composed of a single 32-kDa capsid protein. Particles are generally stable in buffers of pH 4-8."
"20078771","abstracttext_disease symptoms","In infected maize plants, streak disease initially manifests as minute, pale, circular spots on the lowest exposed portion of the youngest leaves. The only leaves that develop symptoms are those formed after infection, with older leaves remaining healthy. As the disease progresses, newer leaves emerge containing streaks up to several millimetres in length along the leaf veins, with primary veins being less affected than secondary or tertiary veins. The streaks are often fused laterally, appearing as narrow, broken, chlorotic stripes, which may extend over the entire length of severely affected leaves. Lesion colour generally varies from white to yellow, with some virus strains causing red pigmentation on maize leaves and abnormal shoot and flower bunching in grasses. Reduced photosynthesis and increased respiration usually lead to a reduction in leaf length and plant height; thus, maize plants infected at an early stage become severely stunted, producing undersized, misshapen cobs or giving no yield at all. Yield loss in susceptible maize is directly related to the time of infection: infected seedlings produce no yield or are killed, whereas plants infected at later times are proportionately less affected."
"20078771","abstracttext_disease control","Disease avoidance can be practised by only planting maize during the early season when viral inoculum loads are lowest. Leafhopper vectors can also be controlled with insecticides such as carbofuran. However, the development and use of streak-resistant cultivars is probably the most effective and economically viable means of preventing streak epidemics. Naturally occurring tolerance to MSV (meaning that, although plants become systemically infected, they do not suffer serious yield losses) has been found, which has primarily been attributed to a single gene, msv-1. However, other MSV resistance genes also exist and improved resistance has been achieved by concentrating these within individual maize genotypes. Whereas true MSV immunity (meaning that plants cannot be symptomatically infected by the virus) has been achieved in lines that include multiple small-effect resistance genes together with msv-1, it has proven difficult to transfer this immunity into commercial maize genotypes. An alternative resistance strategy using genetic engineering is currently being investigated in South Africa."

"29384047","abstracttext_background","Cellulose represents a major source of fermentable sugars in lignocellulosic biomass and a combined action of hydrolytic enzymes (exoglucanases , endoglucanases and β-glucosidases) is required to effectively convert cellulose to glucose that can be fermented to bio-ethanol. However, in-order to make the production of bio-ethanol an economically feasible process, the costs of the enzymes to be used for hydrolysis of the raw material need to be reduced and an increase in specific activity or production efficiency of cellulases is required. Among the cellulases, β-glucosidase not only hydrolyzes cellobiose to glucose but it also reduces the cellobiose inhibition, resulting in efficient functioning of endo- and exo-glucanases. Therefore, in the current study kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of highly active β-glucosidase from randomly mutated Aspergillus niger NIBGE-06 have been evaluated for its industrial applications."
"29384047","abstracttext_objective","The main objective of this study was the identification of mutations and determination of their effect on the physiochemical, kinetic and thermodynamic characteristics of β-glucosidase activity and stability."
"29384047","abstracttext_methods","Pure cultures of Aspergillus niger NIBGE and its 2-Deoxy-D-glucose resistant γ-rays mutant Aspergillus niger NIBGE-06 were grown on Vogel's medium containing wheat bran (3% w/v), at 30±1 °C for 96-108 h. Crude enzymes from both strains were subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation and column chromatography on Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography (FPLC) system. The purified β-glucosidases from both fungal sources were characterized for their native and subunit molecular mass through FPLC and SDS-PAGE, respectively. The purified enzymes were then comparatively characterized for their optimum temperature, activation energy (Ea), temperature quotient (Q10), Optimum pH, Heat of ionization (ΔHI) of active site residues , Michaelis-Menten constants (Vmax, Km, kcat and kcat/Km) and thermodynamics of irreversible inactivation through various enzyme assays. The genomic DNA from both fungal strains was also extracted by SDS-method and full length β- glucosidase genes (bgl) were amplified through PCR. The PCR products were cloned in TA cloning vector followed by the sequencing of potentially full length clones using the commercial services of Macrogen, Korea. The in silico analyses of the sequences thus obtained were also performed using various online tools such as blastn, blastp, GeneWise, SignalP, Inter- ProScan."
"29384047","abstracttext_results","The extracellular β-glucosidases (BGL) from both fungal sources were purified to homogeneity level by ammonium sulfate precipitation and FPLC system. The BGLs from both strains were dimeric in nature, with subunit and native molecular masses of 130 kDa and 252 kDa, respectively. The comparative analysis of nucleotides of bgl genes revealed 8 point mutations. Significant improvement was observed in the kinetic properties of the mutant BGL relative to the wild type enzyme. Arrhenius plot for energy of activation (Ea) showed a biphasic trend and ES-complex formation required Ea of 50 and 42 kJ mol-1 by BGL from parent and mutant, respectively. The pKa1 and pKa2 of the active site residues were 3.4 & 5.5 and 3.2 & 5.6, respectively. The heat of ionization for the acidic limb (ΔHI-AL) and the basic limb (ΔHI-BL) of BGL from both strains were equal to 56 & 41 and 71 & 45 kJ mol-1, respectively. Kinetic constants of cellobiose hydrolysis for BGL from both strains were determined as follows: kcat = 2,589 and 4,135 s-1, Km = 0.24 and 0.26 mM cellobiose, kcat/Km = 10,872 and 15,712 s-1 mM-1 cellobiose, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters for cellobiose hydrolysis also suggested that mutant BGL is more efficient compared to the parent enzyme. Comparative analysis of Ea(d), ΔH* and ΔG* for irreversible thermostability indicated that the thermostabilization of mutant enzyme was due to higher functional energy (free energy), which enabled the enzyme to resist against unfolding of its transition state."
"29384047","abstracttext_conclusion","Physiochemical and thermodynamic characterization of extracellular β-glucosidases (BGL) from 2-Deoxy-Dglucose resistant mutant derivative of A. niger showed that mutagenesis did not greatly affect the physiochemical properties of the BGL enzyme, like temperature optima, pH optima and molecular mass, while the catalytic efficiency for cellobiose hydrolysis was significantly improved (High kcat and kcat/Km). Furthermore, the mutant BGL was more thermostable than the parent enzyme. This shows that random mutagenesis has changed the BGL structural gene, resulting in improvement within its stability- function characteristics. Hence, directed evolution or random mutagenesis with careful selection can result in the engineering of highly efficient enzymes for intended industrial applications."
