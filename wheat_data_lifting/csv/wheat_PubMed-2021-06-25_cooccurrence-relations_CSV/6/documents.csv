"2142646","articletitle","Osmotic stress and abscisic acid induce expression of the wheat Em genes."
"2142646","abstracttext","The early-methionine-labelled (Em) polypeptide is the single most abundant cytosolic protein of dry wheat embryos. It is encoded by messenger RNA which accumulates during the later (maturation) stages of embryogenesis. The accumulation of Em mRNA can be induced in isolated developing embryos, in culture, by the application of the plant growth regulator, abscisic acid, which prevents precocious germination. Precocious germination is also inhibited by the culture of embryos under conditions of osmotic stress when accumulation of Em mRNA is induced. This induction occurs in the absence of any significant increase in the endogenous levels of embryonic abscisic acid although there is a requirement for the continued presence of the growth regulator. Additionally, expression of Em genes can be repeated during early germination, if imbibing embryos are subjected to osmotic stress. Induction of Em-gene expression by osmotic stress is consistent with the proposed role of the Em polypeptide in mediating the remarkable tolerance of cereal embryos to the programmed desiccation undergone during their maturation."
"1726783","articletitle","RNA editing of wheat mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit 9: direct protein and cDNA sequencing."
"1726783","abstracttext","RNA editing of subunit 9 of the wheat mitochondrial ATP synthase has been studied by cDNA and protein sequence analysis. Most of the cDNA clones sequenced (95%) showed that editing by C-to-U transitions occurred at eight positions in the coding region. Consequently, 5 amino acids were changed in the protein when compared with the sequence predicted from the gene. Two edited codons gave no changes (silent editing). One of the C-to-U transitions generated a stop codon by modifying the arginine codon CGA to UGA. Thus, the protein produced is 6 amino acids shorter than that deduced from the genomic sequence. Minor forms of cDNA with partial or overedited sequences were also found. Protein sequence and amino acid composition analyses confirmed the results obtained by cDNA sequencing and showed that the major form of edited atp9 mRNA is translated."
"1953783","articletitle","The lectin wheat germ agglutinin stimulates a protein-tyrosine kinase activity of p72syk in porcine splenocytes."
"1953783","abstracttext","We previously reported a molecular cloning of porcine gene syk encoding a non-receptor type 72-kDa protein-tyrosine kinase and a generation of anti-CPTK40 antibodies which could immunoprecipitate the activity of p72syk (Taniguchi et al. (1991) J. Biol. Chem. 266, 15790-15796). In this study, we have demonstrated that wheat germ agglutinin caused an increase in the autophosphorylation activity of p72syk which preceded an increase of protein-tyrosine phosphorylation observed at the same time in porcine splenocyte. The increase of p72syk activity was dose dependent and was inhibited by the coexistence of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine. Upon stimulation by the combination of 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionophore A23187, we could not detect the increase of activity of p72syk suggesting that the activation of p72syk was independent of protein kinase C and calcium ions."
"1692513","articletitle","Synchronized endocytosis studied in the oocyte of a temperature-sensitive mutant of Drosophila melanogaster."
"1692513","abstracttext","This study demonstrates that endocytosis in the oocyte of Drosophila melanogaster is reversibly blocked at the stage of pit formation by the temperature-sensitive, single-gene mutant, shibirts1. Uptake of horeradish peroxidase conjugated with wheat-germ agglutinin was observed to be normal in mutant oocytes at 19 degrees C, but was blocked at 29 degrees C. After 10 min at 29 degrees C, there was a build-up of coated pits along invaginations of the plasma membrane. Also, the endosomal compartment consisting of tubules, bulbs, and small yolk spheres, disappeared. Lowering the temperature to 19 degrees C after 10 min at 29 degrees C released a synchronized wave of endocytosis into a cytoplasm cleared of uptake-related organelles. By observing this synchronized wave after exposure to 19 degrees C for varying durations, we determined that endocytosis proceeds as follows: coated pits/vesicles----tubules----small yolk spheres----mature yolk spheres. The observations suggest that these organelles transform one into another within this sequence."
"1617739","articletitle","Co-transcription of orf25 and coxIII in rice mitochondria."
"1617739","abstracttext","Southern hybridization analysis using homologous maize probes indicated that orf25 and coxIII are closely linked in the mitochondrial genome of rice (Oryza sativa) cultivar IR36. The two coding regions were found on the same 5.1 kb BamHI fragment, and this fragment was cloned, mapped and partially sequenced. Using probes for each gene derived from the rice clone, a 2.4 kb dicistronic mRNA transcript was found containing both orf25 and coxIII coding regions. Multiple 5' ends were identified by primer extension analysis and a double stem/loop structure was mapped to the 3' end. The orf25 coding region shares greater than 85% identity with orf25 sequences from maize, tobacco and wheat, suggesting that orf25 may code for a conserved protein product."
"1838309","articletitle","Editing of mitochondrial atp9 transcripts from two sorghum lines."
"1838309","abstracttext","Genomic and cDNA sequences of the ATP synthase complex subunit 9 (atp9) genes from two sorghum lines were determined. Sequences of cDNAs revealed eight C to U transcript editing events resulting in six amino acid changes and a new stop codon which eliminated 12 carboxy-terminal residues, compared to the genomic sequence. Sorghum atp9 has a unique five-residue amino-extension relative to other higher plants. The resulting predicted 79-residue gene product has a molecular weight of 8.179 kDa. The predicted phe-val-phe carboxy-terminus is identical to that from cDNA sequences of wheat, Oenothera, and petunia. Partial editing of transcripts was detected in each sorghum line."
"7009386","articletitle","Arrangement of chromosomes in the interphase nucleus of plants."
"7009386","abstracttext","Chromosomal arrangement in the interphase nucleus has two main aspects: (1) arrangement of chromosomes with respect to nuclear polarity and to other nuclear components, and (2) arrangement of chromosomes with respect to one another. The latter aspect consists of two main types of spatial relationships; (1) relationships between different members of one chromosomal set, (b) relationships between different chromosomal sets. Data concerning various aspects of chromosomal arrangement in the interphase nucleus are presented and discussed and the genetic control as well as subcellular mechanisms which are involved in nuclear organization, are elucidated. Evidence is presented indicating that, in common wheat, the gene system that determines the specific pattern of chromosomal arrangement in the nucleus is operating via the microtubular elements of the spindle system. The significance of ordered arrangement of chromosomes in the nucleus for the regularity of genetic activity and chromosomal behavior, is pointed out."
"3066367","articletitle","Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Zea mays: amino-acid sequence of the small subunit."
"3066367","abstracttext","The amino-acid sequence of the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from Zea mays has been determined by alignment of peptides generated by digestion with trypsin, chymotrypsin, staphylococcal protease and thermolysin. The protein-chemically determined structure is in complete agreement with the nucleotide-derived sequence as published recently (Matsuoka et al. (1987) J. Biochem. 102, 673-676), but in addition possesses, however, sixteen experimentally verified dimorphies at various positions and possibly nine more for which evidence is tentatively pointing to two (or more) different expressed nuclear genes for the small subunit. These protein dimorphies represent a protein family corresponding to a gene family, the components of which have not been separated. The closest homologous polypeptide is the small subunit from wheat."
"3536663","articletitle","Expression of a wheat alpha-amylase gene in Escherichia coli: recognition of the translational initiation site and the signal peptide."
"3536663","abstracttext","Transcription of a full-length cDNA clone of wheat alpha-amylase using a lac promoter in Escherichia coli results in synthesis of a precursor alpha-amylase polypeptide of the correct size, indicating that translation initiates correctly. Recognition of the plant translational initiation site by E. coli ribosomes is 15-20% as efficient as the ribosome-binding site of the beta-lactamase gene when it is fused to alpha-amylase. The alpha-amylase signal peptide is recognised in E. coli resulting in secretion of the enzyme into the periplasmic space; deletion of the signal peptide prevents secretion. Replacement of the alpha-amylase signal peptide with a beta-lactamase signal peptide also enables the bacterial cell to secrete the enzyme. The presence of the beta-lactamase and the alpha-amylase signal peptides in tandem results in secretion of the enzyme and removal of both signal peptides."
"7737506","articletitle","The presence of tRNA pseudogenes in mammalia and plants and their absence in yeast may account for different specificities of pre-tRNA processing enzymes."
"7737506","abstracttext","Six of 13 cloned members of the human tRNA(Val) gene family code for tRNA(Val) pseudogenes, of which all but one are transcribed efficiently in HeLa cell extracts. Due to single or multiple mismatches in stem regions, the corresponding pre-tRNAs are resistant against the action of human 5'- and 3'-processing enzymes and are thus prevented from being converted to mature tRNAs. Surprisingly, all of them are accurately and efficiently processed to mature-sized tRNA in yeast nuclear extract. This is in agreement with corresponding studies of plant pre-tRNAs which are not processed in wheat germ extract but are rapidly processed in yeast extract. These observations imply that the yeast pre-tRNA 5'- and 3'-maturases do not monitor the three-dimensional structure of their substrates as stringently as mammalian and plant enzymes, possibly because tRNA pseudogenes do not occur in yeast."
"6929532","articletitle","Effect of introduction of small alkyl groups on mRNA function."
"6929532","abstracttext","Treatment of RNA with dimethyl sulfate methylates only nitrogens, preferentially the 7 position of guanosine, whereas treatment with ethylnitrosourea ethylates mainly oxygens, preferentially the phosphodiester groups. Two plant viral mRNAs were modified with these two reagents at levels of 4-28 alkylations per molecule. The ability of alkylated RNAs to stimulate amino acid incorporation in the wheat germ system was somewhat diminished by both types of modification, but the predominant protein made, as ascertained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, was the typical gene product of the respective mRNA. These data suggest that random alkylations, mostly of either the guanosine N-7s or the phosphates, do not interfere with peptide chain elongation, but that the ability to initiate translation properly is affected by these substitutions, presumably through their effect on the conformation of the RNAs."
"6341380","articletitle","Construction of a synthetic messenger RNA encoding a membrane protein."
"6341380","abstracttext","We have synthesized microgram quantities of a functional eucaryotic mRNA by in vitro transcription. For this purpose, we constructed a plasmid in which the Escherichia coli lactose promoter was 5' to the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein gene (Rose, J. K., and C. J. Gallione, 1981, J. Virol., 39:519-528). This DNA served as the template in an in vitro transcription reaction utilizing E. coli RNA polymerase. The RNA product was capped using the vaccinia guanylyltransferase. A typical preparation of the synthetic G mRNA was equivalent to the amount of G mRNA that can be isolated from approximately 10(8) VSV-infected cells. This synthetic mRNA was translated by a wheat germ extract in the presence of microsomes, producing a polypeptide that was indistinguishable from G protein in its size, antigenicity, degree of glycosylation, and its membrane insertion. This technique should aid in identifying features needed by proteins for insertion into membranes."
"7521796","articletitle","Translation in a wheat germ cell-free system of RNA from mitochondria of the normal and Texas male-sterile cytoplasms of maize (Zea mays L.)."
"7521796","abstracttext","RNA isolated from etiolated seedling shoot mitochondria of maize (Zea mays L.) with normal (N) or Texas male-sterile (T) cytoplasm stimulated the incorporation of [35S]-methionine into protein when added to a cell-free protein-synthesizing system from wheat germ. Discrete polypeptides with molecular masses of up to approximately 67 kDa were synthesized, and the pattern of bands was distinct from that obtained with total RNA. Products of translation of T-urf13 RNA were identified by immunoprecipitation, and of atpA, coxI, and coxII RNA by hybrid arrest of translation by the cloned gene. Several polypeptides were differentially synthesized from N and T mitochondrial RNA; these differences were more extensive than those found when isolated, intact, N and T mitochondria are allowed to synthesize proteins."
"8251057","articletitle","The amino acid sequence of a protein from wheat kernel closely related to proteins involved in the mechanisms of plant defence."
"8251057","abstracttext","The amino acid sequence of wheatwin1, a monomeric protein of 125 residues isolated from wheat kernel (variety S. Pastore), is reported. Wheatwin1 is highly homologous (95%) to barwin, a protein from barley seed, which was shown to be related to the C-terminal domain of two proteins encoded by the wound-induced genes win1 and win2 in potato and to a protein encoded by the same domain of the hevein gene (hev1) in rubber tree. Similarly to barwin, wheatwin1 contains six cysteine residues all linked in disulfide bridges and the N-terminal residue is pyroglutamate. Moreover, structural studies performed on wheatwin1 and win1 protein by predictive methods demonstrated that these proteins and barwin are closely related in the secondary structure also. The high level of homology found with the product of win1, win2, and hev1 genes strongly suggests that barwin and wheatwin1 play a common role in the mechanism of plant defence."
"8263390","articletitle","CGRP-immunoreactive cells supplying laryngeal sensory nerve fibres in the cat's nodose ganglion."
"8263390","abstracttext","Through a combination of retrograde staining by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and immunohistochemistry, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-reactive sensory neurons projecting from the laryngeal mucosa were detected in the feline nodose ganglion. The size of the CGRP-immunoreactive cell which was regarded as a laryngeal sensory neuron, was about 60 microns in diameter: the shape of the immunoreactive laryngeal sensory neuron was unipolar. CGRP-reacted laryngeal sensory cells were found in the rostral part of the nodose ganglion extending to the middle part. They aggregated in the most rostral part, were sparse in other parts and were approximately 50 per cent of WGA-reactive laryngeal sensory neurons in number. Our results suggest that this neurotransmitter might play an important role in laryngeal peripheral sensory innervation."
"8219072","articletitle","Functional expression and molecular characterization of AtUBC2-1, a novel ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) from Arabidopsis thaliana."
"8219072","abstracttext","The first member of a novel subfamily of ubiquitin-conjugating E2-proteins was cloned from a cDNA library of Arabidopsis thaliana. Genomic blots indicate that this gene family (AtUBC2) consists of two members and is distinct from AtUBC1, the only other E2 enzyme known from this species to date (M.L. Sullivan and R.D. Vierstra, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86 (1989) 9861-9865). The cDNA sequence of AtUBC2-1 extends over 794 bp which would encode a protein of 161 amino acids and a calculated molecular mass of 18.25 kDa. The protein encoded by AtUBC2-1 is shown to accept 125I-ubiquitin from wheat E1 enzymes, when expressed from Escherichia coli hosts as fusion protein carrying N-terminal extensions. It is deubiquitinated in the presence of lysine and, by these criteria, is considered a functional E2 enzyme."
"7980385","articletitle","Extraction and genetic control of two new water-soluble proteins of mature barley seed."
"7980385","abstracttext","This paper describes the genetic control of two new water-soluble proteins in barley. Water-soluble proteins (WSPs) of mature barley seed form part of the albumin/globulin class of seed proteins. They can be extracted from hand-milled grain with water, though some WSPs are more efficiently extracted with a solution of 10 mM dithiothreitol. Polymorphisms for WSPs were detected in isoelectric focusing gels incorporating various ampholine combinations. Two new controlling genes (Wsp4 and Wsp5) have been identified and located using wheat/barley chromosome addition lines and barley doubled haploids. Wsp4 is located on chromosome 2 (2H), and Wsp5 was found to be tightly linked to Wsp2 on the long arm of chromosome 7 (5HL). Segregation of a sixth gene (Wsp6) is also described, but this has not been mapped. The results are discussed with respect to other previously mapped Wsp loci."
"8987539","articletitle","Rice allergenic protein and molecular-genetic approach for hypoallergenic rice."
"8987539","abstracttext","Allergenic proteins with a molecular mass of about 14 to 16 kDa were isolated from a rice salt-soluble fraction based on the reactivity with IgE antibodies from patients allergic to rice. cDNA clones encoding these allergenic proteins were isolated from a cDNA library of maturing rice seeds, and the deduced amino acid sequences showed considerable similarity to wheat and barley alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitors, which have recently been identified as major allergens associated with baker's asthma. An antisense RNA strategy was applied to repress the allergen gene expression in maturing rice seeds. Immunoblotting and ELISA analyses of the seeds using a monoclonal antibody to a 16-kDa allergen showed that allergen content of seeds from several transgenic rice plants was markedly lower than that of the seeds from parental wild type rice."
"8939812","articletitle","Deficiency of cox1 gene expression in wheat plants with Aegilops columnaris cytoplasm."
"8939812","abstracttext","Wheat plants with Aegilops columnaris cytoplasm are characterized by growth inhibition and partial male sterility and show an impaired mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase activity. We designed this study to clarify the functional relationship between this impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity and possible structural alterations to the mitochondrial genes cox1, cox2 and cox3 that encode three subunits of the cytochrome c oxidase. Using restriction mapping and DNA sequencing, we found major rearrangements in the flanking regions of the cox1 and cox3 genes. In Northern-blot analysis, we detected two different cox3 transcripts and a reduced level of a cox2 transcript, whereas we could not detect a transcript of cox1. These results suggest that rearrangements of the flanking regions of the cox1 gene may result in the severe suppression of its transcription, and subsequently, may lead to the impaired cytochrome c oxidase activity."
"9000559","articletitle","Short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides reduce the occurrence of colon tumors and develop gut-associated lymphoid tissue in Min mice."
"9000559","abstracttext","C57BL/6J-Min/+ mice, which are heterozygous for a non-sense mutation in the Apc gene, provide a model for both familial adenomatous polyposis and sporadic colon cancers. In our study, gut tumors and small intestine lymphoid nodules were counted in Min mice fed fiber-enriched diets for 6 weeks. Neither starch-free wheat bran nor resistant starch modified the number of tumors. However, short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides dramatically reduced the incidence of colon tumors and concomitantly developed gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Our experiment shows that short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides counteract advanced stages of colon carcinogenesis, possibly via stimulation of antitumoral immunity by modulation of the colonic ecosystem."
"9205568","articletitle","An overview of the safety evaluation of the Thermomyces lanuginosus xylanase enzyme (SP 628) and the Aspergillus aculeatus xylanase enzyme (SP 578)."
"9205568","abstracttext","Xylanases SP 628 and SP 578 were produced by submerged fermentation of Aspergillus oryzae, containing a gene code originating from Thermomyces lanuginosus and Aspergillus aculeatus, respectively. Both enzymes were subject to the same series of toxicological tests to document their safety in use. The enzymes are to be applied as processing aids in the baking industry and in wheat starch separation. Neither enzyme was found to be mutagenic in the Salmonella typhimurium reverse mutation assay, nor did they cause chromosomal aberrations in cultured human peripheral lymphocytes. No evidence of inhalation toxicity or skin and eye irritation was found. The enzymes are not regarded as skin-sensitizers, although the Buehler test with guinea-pigs revealed a minor potential. Oral administration up to 10.0 ml/kg bw/day (equivalent to a Total Organic Solids amount of 13.3% for SP 628 and of 11.3% for SP 578) in 13-week rat studies did not show any adverse effect."
"9161415","articletitle","Molecular cloning and expression of the large subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase from barley (Hordeum vulgare) leaves."
"9161415","abstracttext","A cDNA clone, blpl14, corresponding to the large subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), has been isolated from a cDNA library prepared from leaves of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). An open reading frame encodes a protein of 503 aa, with a calculated molecular weight of 54815. The derived aa sequence contains a putative transit peptide sequence, required for targeting to plastids, and has a highly conserved positioning of critical Lys residues that are believed to be involved in effector binding. The derived aa sequence shows 97% identity with the corresponding protein from wheat, but only 36% identity with AGPase from E. coli. The blpl14 gene is expressed predominantly in leaves and to a lesser degree in seed endosperm, but not roots, of barley."
"9005441","articletitle","The de novo protein with grafted biological function: transferring of interferon blast-transforming activity to albebetin."
"9005441","abstracttext","The de novo protein albebetin has been designed recently to form a predetermined tertiary fold that has not yet been observed in natural proteins. An eight amino acid fragment (131-138) of human interferon alpha(2) carrying the blast-transforming activity of the protein was attached to the N-terminus of albebetin next to its initiatory methionine residue. The gene of chimeric protein was expressed in a wheat germ cell-free translation system and synthesized protein was tested for its compactness and stability. Its ability for receptor binding was also studied. We have shown that albebetin with attached octapeptide is practically as compact as natural proteins of corresponding molecular weight and possesses high stability toward the urea-induced unfolding. It binds murine thymocyte receptor at a high affinity and activates the thymocyte blast transformation efficiently at a concentration of 10(-11) M."
"8623538","articletitle","The complete nucleotide sequence of barley mild mosaic virus RNA1 and its relationship with other members of the Potyviridae."
"8623538","abstracttext","The complete nucleotide sequence of RNA1 of a French barley mild mosaic bymovirus isolate has been determined. The molecule is composed of 7261 nucleotides and contains a single large open reading frame encoding a protein of 2258 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 256,375. Amino acid sequence comparison with poty- and rymoviruses reveals eight domains corresponding to the potyviral P3, 6K1, Cl, 6K2, Nla-VPg, Nla-Pro, Nlb and capsid proteins, respectively. Seven putative cleavage sites, similar to those mediated by potyvirus Nla proteinases, were identified. The presence of two, so far undescribed putative cleavage sites (6K2/Nla-VPg and Nla-VPg/Nla-Pro) in the polyproteins encoded by RNA1 of barley yellow mosaic virus and wheat spindle streak mosaic virus, was predicted. These data indicate that the bymovirus RNA1 fits the consensus potyviral genetic map downstream of the helper component gene."
"8837463","articletitle","Cloning of a gene encoding cinnamoyl ester hydrolase from the ruminal bacterium Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens E14 by a novel method."
"8837463","abstracttext","A gene (cinI) encoding a cinnamoyl ester hydrolase (CEH) has been isolated from the ruminal bacterium, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens E14, using a model substrate, MUTMAC [4-methylumbelliferoyl (p-trimethylammonium cinnamate chloride)]. CinI has significant amino-acid similarities with members of a large and diverse family of hydrolases with a serine/aspartic acid/histidine catalytic triad. Our analyses identified two previously unclassified amino acid sequences, the amino-terminal domain of unknown function in XynZ from Clostridium thermocellum and XynC, an acetylxylan esterase from Caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus, as members of the same family of hydrolases. A previously described esterase with CEH activity, XylD from Pseudomonas fluorescens ssp. cellulosa, is not similar to CinI. CinI was expressed at high levels in the periplasmic fraction of E. coli TOPP2 and released ferulic acid from Fara [5-O-(trans-feruloyl)-arabinofuranose] prepared from wheat bran."
"9247551","articletitle","Molecular genetic and biochemical analysis of Brassica napus proliferating cell nuclear antigen function."
"9247551","abstracttext","A cDNA encoding the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) from Brassica napus (oilseed rape) was shown to complement the lethal deletion mutation in the PCNA gene (delta POL30) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We provide unequivocal evidence that the B. napus PCNA can perform all the essential functions of the yeast PCNA in DNA replication, although some species-specific differences may exist. In addition, the B. napus PCNA expressed as a fusion polypeptide with glutathione S-transferase (GST) was shown to stimulate the activity and processivity of two delta-like DNA polymerases from wheat in vitro. These experiments provide direct biochemical evidence that the B. napus PCNA may function as an auxiliary factor in plant cell DNA replication."
"9924828","articletitle","Group specific PCR-detection of potential trichothecene-producing Fusarium-species in pure cultures and cereal samples."
"9924828","abstracttext","A PCR based assay (Tox5 PCR) which analyses Fusarium species potentially producing trichothecenes was developed using a pair of primers derived from the DNA-sequence of the trichodiene synthase gene (tri5). The primer pair was tested using DNA isolated from a variety of strains representing 64 species and varieties of Fusarium as well as from other fungi, bacteria and cereals. A 658 bp PCR fragment was specifically amplified with DNA isolated from strains of species belonging to the Fusarium sections Discolor, Sporotrichiella, Arthrosporiella, Gibbosum, and ""Dlaminia"". PCR products obtained were sequenced. Alignment to tri5 sequences given in the literature revealed a high degree of homology. Results of the PCR developed correlated well with literature data on the trichothecene producing capabilities of the respective species. Potential trichothecene producing fusaria were detected in contaminated cereals and malts using the Tox5 PCR assay. Intensity of the signals produced were well correlated with the concentration of deoxynivalenol (DON) in samples of wheat."
"9487693","articletitle","A transcriptional regulator of the LuxR-UhpA family, FlcA, controls flocculation and wheat root surface colonization by Azospirillum brasilense Sp7."
"9487693","abstracttext","Genetic complementation of a spontaneous mutant, impaired in flocculation, Congo red binding, and colonization of root surface, led to the identification of a new regulatory gene in Azospirillum brasilense Sp7, designated flcA. The deduced amino acid sequence of flcA shared high similarity with a family of transcriptional activators of the LuxR-UphA family. The most significant match was with the AgmR protein, an activator for glycerol metabolism in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Derivatives of Sp7 resulting from site-directed Tn5 mutagenesis in the flcA coding sequence were constructed by marker exchange. Characterization of the resulting mutant strains showed that flcA controls the production of capsular polysaccharides, the flocculation process in culture, and the colonization of the root surface of wheat. This study provides new information on the genetic control of the mechanism of plant root colonization by Azospirillum."
"9526137","articletitle","Poll glands of the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius): a histochemical and scanning electron microscopic study."
"9526137","abstracttext","Poll glands of the one-humped camel were obtained to examine their secretory mechanism by lectin histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and scanning electron microscopy. The glands were composed of numerous conical lobules which consisted of apocrine tubules. Lectins of peanut agglutinin (PNA), Dolicos biflorus agglutinin (DBA) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) showed a variety of staining in the Golgi areas and secretory granules in secretory cells of the apocrine tubules. Most myoepithelial cells stained intensely with a-smooth muscle actin. Varicose nerve fibers immunostained with protein gene product 9.5 were scattered among apocrine tubules. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the luminal surface of secretory cells was covered with microvilli and that secretory cells pinched off smooth-surfaced apocrine blebs. After pinching off, crater-like pits remained on the luminal surface of secretory cells. These findings are similar to those obtained from the infraorbital glands of the serows."
"11390964","articletitle","Kinetics and mechanism of DNA uptake into the cell nucleus."
"11390964","abstracttext","Gene transfer to eukaryotic cells requires the uptake of exogenous DNA into the cell nucleus. Except during mitosis, molecular access to the nuclear interior is limited to passage through the nuclear pores. Here we demonstrate the nuclear uptake of extended linear DNA molecules by a combination of fluorescence microscopy and single-molecule manipulation techniques, using the latter to follow uptake kinetics of individual molecules in real time. The assays were carried out on nuclei reconstituted in vitro from extracts of Xenopus eggs, which provide both a complete complement of biochemical factors involved in nuclear protein import, and unobstructed access to the nuclear pores. We find that uptake of DNA is independent of ATP or GTP hydrolysis, but is blocked by wheat germ agglutinin. The kinetics are much slower than would be expected from hydrodynamic considerations. A fit of the data to a simple model suggests femto-Newton forces and a large friction relevant to the uptake process."
"11027564","articletitle","Expression of integrated hepatitis B virus X variants in human hepatocellular carcinomas and its significance."
"11027564","abstracttext","Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBX) has been implicated in the transactivation of diverse cellular genes and possibly also the pathogenesis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We report the characterization of HBX variants from HBV-related human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These HBX variants were integrated into the host chromosomes and also expressed in the HCC tissues. In addition, we report a novel in vitro HBX activity assay based on color changes that were indicative of the beta-galactosidase enzyme activity. Conducted in wheat germ lysates, the transactivating function of either wild type or mutant HBX protein was measured through their interaction with the Early Growth Response factor 1 (Egr-1) that controls the beta-galactosidase gene. Further analysis of these HBX deletion mutants using this assay may shed new insights on the significance of various mutations occurring in HCC-associated HBX."
"11076997","articletitle","Assessment of in vitro mutagenicity in Salmonella and in vivo genotoxicity in mice of the mycotoxin fumonisin B(1)."
"11076997","abstracttext","Fumonisin B(1) (FB(1)), a mycotoxin produced by Fusarium moniliforme, is a contaminant of cereals with various and complex cellular effects. FB(1) induces liver cancer in rats and has been linked to esophageal cancer in South Africa and China. The mechanisms of FB(1)-induced carcinogenesis are uncertain and the information on FB(1) mutagenic properties is limited and controversial. FB(1) contamination levels in maize and wheat from Chile were found to be similar to those in other countries. FB(1) was devoid of activity in gene mutation assays with Salmonella typhimurium strains TA100, TA102 and TA98. However, i.p. injection of FB(1) induced an increased frequency of micronuclei in mouse bone marrow polychromatic erythrocytes at 25 and 100 mg/kg. We conclude that FB(1) induces in vivo genotoxicity in the absence of in vitro mutagenicity in Salmonella."
"10476064","articletitle","Transcription activation mediated by the bZIP factor SPA on the endosperm box is modulated by ESBF-1 in vitro."
"10476064","abstracttext","A modified in vitro transcription system has been used to study the function of the cloned bZIP transcription factor SPA and the binding activity ESBF I in activating transcription from the bifactorial endosperm box region of the wheat prolamin LMWG-1D1 gene. Recombinant SPA expressed in Escherichia coli activated transcription from the endosperm box motif, and this was dependent upon the binding of the nuclear protein ESBF I. ESBF I did not activate transcription independently, but potentiated SPA-mediated transcriptional activation. ESBF I is likely to be the equivalent of, or contain the recently characterised DOF class of, Zn-finger protein called WPBF. These data provide new information about the interplay of members of the bZIP and DOF transcription factor families in regulating expression from bifactorial sites found in a variety of plant promoters."
"10586878","articletitle","Angiosperm phylogeny inferred from multiple genes as a tool for comparative biology."
"10586878","abstracttext","Comparative biology requires a firm phylogenetic foundation to uncover and understand patterns of diversification and evaluate hypotheses of the processes responsible for these patterns. In the angiosperms, studies of diversification in floral form, stamen organization, reproductive biology, photosynthetic pathway, nitrogen-fixing symbioses and life histories have relied on either explicit or implied phylogenetic trees. Furthermore, to understand the evolution of specific genes and gene families, evaluate the extent of conservation of plant genomes and make proper sense of the huge volume of molecular genetic data available for model organisms such as Arabidopsis, Antirrhinum, maize, rice and wheat, a phylogenetic perspective is necessary. Here we report the results of parsimony analyses of DNA sequences of the plastid genes rbcL and atpB and the nuclear 18S rDNA for 560 species of angiosperms and seven non-flowering seed plants and show a well-resolved and well-supported phylogenetic tree for the angiosperms for use in comparative biology."
"10628859","articletitle","Transcripts containing the 5' untranslated regions of the plastid genes psbA and psbB from higher plants are unstable in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii chloroplasts."
"10628859","abstracttext","The 5' regions of chloroplast genes contain cis-acting regulatory elements including promoters, and determinants of RNA stability and translation. In this work I examined whether the 5' regions of the spinach psbB and the wheat psbA genes can drive the expression of an aadA reporter gene in chloroplasts of the unicellar green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Both plant 5' sequences confer aadA-dependent, spectinomycin resistance on Escherichia coli, but not on the alga following integration into its chloroplast genome. Northern and run-on transcription analyses reveal that the plant promotors are active in C. reinhardtii but that the resulting chimeric transcripts are unstable. Therefore, the data suggest differences between higher plants and green algae with respect to the molecular mechanisms underlying plastid RNA metabolism."
"11607411","articletitle","The circadian oscillator is regulated by a very low fluence response of phytochrome in wheat."
"11607411","abstracttext","Expression of genes encoding the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins of photosystem II (Cab) in etiolated wheat seedlings is controlled by phytochrome and a circadian clock. Even photoconversion of <1% of phytochrome to its active form, which can be achieved by moonlight, induces the expression of the Cab genes, particularly that of the Cab-1 gene, in circadian fashion. Thus, this reaction shows the characteristics of a low and a very low fluence response. A single far-red light pulse given to an etiolated seedling is sufficient for a persistence of the circadian oscillation of the Cab-1 mRNA level for at least 100 h. Subsequent red (R) or long-wavelength far-red (RG9) light irradiations alter the free running rhythm. These observations indicate a change in sensitivity to phytochrome and/or a control by stable phytochrome. The latter hypothesis is supported by the observation that the level of Cab-1 mRNA is increased or decreased by a second R or RG9 light pulse, respectively."

"11983285","abstracttext","Distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-like substance in the optic lobe cortex and retina of the octopus was examined immunohistochemically. Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), a retrograde-transporting marker, was also used to label the centrifugal neurons. CGRP-immunoreactive (CGRP-IR) somata were seen in the inner granular cell layer, but not in the outer granular cell layer or the retina. CGRP-IR fibers were seen not only in the optic lobe cortex, but also in the retinal nerve plexus. Retrogradely labeled somata were seen in the inner granular cell layer, but not in the outer granular cell layer. Immunohistochemical double staining indicated that WGA-labeled centrifugal neurons were immunopositive for CGRP. These results suggested that the centrifugal neurons in the octopus optic lobe cortex are CGRP-like peptide-containing neurons, and that the peptide may modulate photoreceptor cell functions."

"15378246","abstracttext","Three dominant resistance genes, Pr3, Pr4, and Pr5, were identified by genetic analysis of resistance to leaf rust in rye (Puccinia recondita f. sp. secalis). Each of the three genes confers resistance to a broad scale of single-pustule isolates (SPIs), but differences could be observed for specific Pr gene/SPI combinations. Resistance conferred by the three genes was effective in both detached-leaf tests carried out on seedlings and in field tests of adult plants. Molecular marker analysis mapped Pr3 to the centromeric region of rye chromosome arm 1RS, whereas Pr4 and Pr5 were assigned to the centromeric region of 1RL. Chromosomal localization and reaction patterns to specific SPIs provide evidence that the three Pr genes represent distinct and novel leaf-rust resistance genes in rye. The contributions of these genes to resistance breeding in rye and wheat are discussed."

"12032089","abstracttext","Accurate tRNA 3' end maturation is essential for aminoacylation and thus for protein synthesis in all organisms. Here we report the first identification of protein and DNA sequences for tRNA 3'-processing endonucleases (RNase Z). Purification of RNase Z from wheat identified a 43 kDa protein correlated with the activity. Peptide sequences obtained from the purified protein were used to identify the corresponding gene. In vitro expression of the homologous proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana and Methano coccus janaschii confirmed their tRNA 3'-processing activities. These RNase Z proteins belong to the ELAC1/2 family of proteins and to the cluster of orthologous proteins COG 1234. The RNase Z enzymes from A.thaliana and M.janaschii are the first members of these families to which a function can now be assigned. Proteins with high sequence similarity to the RNase Z enzymes from A.thaliana and M.janaschii are present in all three kingdoms."
"12667868","articletitle","The genetic colinearity of rice and other cereals on the basis of genomic sequence analysis."
"12667868","abstracttext","Small segments of rice genome sequence have been compared with that of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and with several closer relatives, including the cereals maize, rice, sorghum, barley and wheat. The rice genome is relatively stable relative to those of other grasses. Nevertheless, comparisons with other cereals have demonstrated that the DNA between cereal genes is highly variable and evolves rapidly. Genic regions have undergone many more small rearrangements than have been revealed by recombinational mapping studies. Tandem gene duplication/deletion is particularly common, but other types of deletions, inversions and translocations also occur. The many thousands of small genic rearrangements within the rice genome complicate but do not negate its use as a model for larger cereal genomes."

"12573853","abstracttext","The publicly reported limited application of marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding programmes to date is reviewed and contrasted with the current situation, in which it has increasingly become technically feasible to tag almost any gene with a microsatellite assay. Although this capability is starting to have an impact on the conduct of large breeding programmes, a much more profound change in breeding strategy will become possible when single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) technology has matured sufficiently so that the throughput of molecular marker-based genotyping is able to keep pace with the numbers of plants that breeders routinely handle in the field. We explore the extent to which the genomics revolution might generate a change in the conventional breeding paradigm, which has operated with such success for the best part of the 20th century, and identify the need for a substantial reduction in assay price before MAS is likely to make more than a marginal impact on present practice."
"12695848","articletitle","Mating, conidiation and pathogenicity of Fusarium graminearum, the main causal agent of the head-blight disease of wheat, are regulated by the MAP kinase gpmk1."
"12695848","abstracttext","To date, only very little is known about the molecular infection mechanisms of the head-blight pathogen of wheat, Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph Gibberella zeae). Here, we report on the isolation and characterization of the Fus3/Pmk1 mitogen-activated protein kinase homologue Gpmk1 from F. graminearum. Disruption of the gpmk1 gene in F. graminearum results in mutants that are reduced in conidial production, are sexually sterile and are fully apathogenic. This leads to the conclusion that gpmk1 is responsible for signal transduction processes taking place during the most important developmental stages in the life cycle of this fungal pathogen. Thus, Delta gpmk1 mutants are a useful tool to find other important genes involved in plant-infection mechanisms. Previously, only the trichothecene biosynthesis pathway was identified as a virulence factor in F. graminearum. Hence, Gpmk1 is now the second pathogenicity trait to be known in this important plant pathogen."

"12656176","abstracttext","A strain was isolated from red soil from the suburb of Kunming in Yunnan, China, during the screening of agricultural antibiotics which prevented and cured wheat-stem rust. This isolate, designated YIM 41004T (= CGMCC 4.1004T = DSM 41793), was identified by a polyphasic approach. The test results suggested that this strain was clearly assigned to the genus Streptomyces and found to be marginally close to Williams cluster 32 based on the morphological and physiological data. The almost-complete 16S rRNA gene sequence of the strain was determined and compared with those of representative streptomycetes. The phylogenetic tree confirmed its membership in the genus Streptomyces and demonstrated that this strain represented a separate phyletic line in a clade encompassed by streptomycetes within cluster 32. Based on the polyphasic evidence, it is therefore proposed that strain YIM 41004T should be classified as Streptomyces yunnanensis sp. nov."

"12659836","abstracttext","From a number of wild plant species growing on soils highly contaminated by heavy metals in Eastern Spain, Nicotiana glauca R. Graham (shrub tobacco) was selected for biotechnological modification, because it showed the most appropriate properties for phytoremediation. This plant has a wide geographic distribution, is fast-growing with a high biomass, and is repulsive to herbivores. Following Agrobacterium mediated transformation, the induction and overexpression of a wheat gene encoding phytochelatin synthase (TaPCS1) in this particular plant greatly increased its tolerance to metals such as Pb and Cd, developing seedling roots 160% longer than wild type plants. In addition, seedlings of transformed plants grown in mining soils containing high levels of Pb (1572 ppm) accumulated double concentration of this heavy metal than wild type. These results indicate that the transformed N. glauca represents a highly promising new tool for use in phytoremediation efforts."
"12730371","articletitle","A novel class of gene controlling virulence in plant pathogenic ascomycete fungi."
"12730371","abstracttext","Insertional mutants of the fungal maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus were screened for altered virulence. One mutant had 60% reduction in lesion size relative to WT but no other detectable change in phenotype. Analysis of sequence at the insertion site revealed a gene (CPS1) encoding a protein with two AMP-binding domains. CPS1 orthologs were detected in all Cochliobolus spp. examined, in several other classes of ascomycete fungi, and in animals but not in basidiomycete fungi, bacteria, or plants. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that CPS1 represents a previously undescribed subset of adenylate-forming enzymes that have diverged from certain acyl-CoA ligases, which in bacteria are involved in biosynthesis of nonribosomal peptides or polyketidepeptide hybrids. Disruption of CPS1 caused reduced virulence of both race T and race O of C. heterostrophus on maize, of Cochliobolus victoriae on oats, and of Gibberella zeae on wheat. These results suggest that CPS1 functions as a general fungal virulence factor in plant pathogenic ascomycetes."

"15849410","abstracttext","Buckwheat often causes severe allergic reactions, even when its ingestion level is extremely low. Therefore, buckwheat is listed in several countries as a common food allergen. In addition to common buckwheat and Tartarian buckwheat that are cultivated and consumed widely, wild buckwheat may be potentially allergenic. Food containing undeclared buckwheat poses a risk to patients with the buckwheat allergy. We describe in this report a PCR method to detect buckwheat DNA by using primers corresponding to the internal transcribed spacer region and the 5.8S rRNA gene. The method is buckwheat-specific and compatible with both cultivated and wild buckwheat of the Fagopyrum spp. Its sensitivity was sufficient to detect 1 ppm (w/w) of buckwheat DNA spiked in wheat DNA. This method should benefit food manufacturers, clinical doctors, and allergic patients by providing information on the presence of buckwheat contamination in food."

All NILs had no significant difference to their recurrent parents in the investigated traits of agronomic importance. The results of AFLP analysis indicated Jaccard's genetic similarity of the NILs with their recurrent parents varied from 0.96 to 0.98, and confirmed that the NILs had high genetic similarity with their recurrent parents. The resistance to powdery mildew was stably expressed by the relevant NILs. Eleven of the NILs were tested using molecular markers linked to the resistance genes Pm1c, Pm4b, Pm13, Pm21, PmP, PmE, PmPS5A, PmPS5B, PmY39, PmY150, and PmH, and they were all found to carry the targeted genes.

"14709414","abstracttext","Celiac disease is characterized by intestinal mucosal injury and malabsorption precipitated by dietary exposure to gluten of some cereals with a prominent role being played by gliadins, specific antigenic determinants found in wheat gluten. Patients suffering from celiac disease have serum antibodies recognizing gliadin, as well as the endomysial autoantigen tissue transglutaminase. Phage display antibody libraries have revealed ectopic production of anti-transglutaminase antibodies by intestinal lymphocytes with a biased use of the VH5 antibody gene family. Here we report a study on the pairing of VH and VL families in the antibodies to transglutaminase. Our results led to the construction of small phage display antibody libraries based on the amplification of the two genes in the VH5 family from intestinal lymphocytes. This method can be used for the rapid characterization of the anti-transglutaminase response in a potentially large number of subjects including asymptomatic patients whose serum antibodies may be undetectable."

"14629347","abstracttext","The effects of recent colonization on the aphid parasitoid, Diaeretiella rapae (M'Intosh) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae: Aphidiidae), in Western Australia were investigated. When compared with populations from the Old World, the results of a microsatellite analysis show that the insects have low allelic length and low allele frequency variation, revealing that these individuals experienced a significant founder effect. Marked genetic differentiation between populations was also revealed, which has potentially important implications for host utilization in this species when introduced to a new geographical area(s). Low genetic variation and gene flow in a founder population could limit evolutionary potential in Australia, including the ability of a population to mount a response to newly introduced hosts, such as the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko). Although the actual importance of genetic diversity in the success of biological control agents is unclear, current theory concerning the potential impact of genetic bottlenecks on additive genetic variance is discussed."

However, the two strains shared low DNA-DNA relatedness. Strain 88T also had a profile of phenotypic properties that readily distinguished it from representatives of the species of Saccharopolyspora with validly published names. It is evident from the combination of genotypic and phenotypic data that the organism should be classified within a novel species of the genus Saccharopolyspora, for which the name Saccharopolyspora shandongensis sp. nov. is proposed.

"18515487","abstracttext","The bacterium Xenorhabdus nematophila is an insect pathogen and an obligate symbiont of the nematode Steinernema carpocapsae. X. nematophila makes a biofilm that adheres to the head of the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a capability X. nematophila shares with the biofilms made by Yersinia pestis and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. As in Yersinia spp., the X. nematophila biofilm requires a 4-gene operon, hmsHFRS. Also like its Yersinia counterparts, the X. nematophila biofilm is bound by the lectin wheat germ agglutinin, suggesting that beta-linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine or N-acetylneuraminic acid is a component of the extracellular matrix. C. elegans mutants with aberrant surfaces that do not permit Yersinia biofilm attachment also are resistant to X. nematophila biofilms. An X. nematophila hmsH mutant that failed to make biofilms on C. elegans had no detectable defect in symbiotic association with S. carpocapsae, nor was virulence reduced against the insect Manduca sexta."

"18539481","abstracttext","We established transgenic mouse lines expressing a transneuronal tracer, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), under the control of mouse T1R3 gene promoter/enhancer. In the taste buds, WGA transgene was faithfully expressed in T1R3-positive sweet/umami taste receptor cells. WGA protein was transferred not laterally to the synapse-bearing, sour-responsive type III cells in the taste buds but directly to a subset of neurons in the geniculate and nodose/petrosal ganglia, and further conveyed to a rostro-central region of the nucleus of solitary tract. In addition, WGA was expressed in solitary chemoreceptor cells in the nasal epithelium and transferred along the trigeminal sensory pathway to the brainstem neurons. The solitary chemoreceptor cells endogenously expressed T1R3 together with bitter taste receptors T2Rs. This result shows an exceptional signature of receptor expression. Thus, the t1r3-WGA transgenic mice revealed the sweet/umami gustatory pathways from taste receptor cells and the trigeminal neural pathway from solitary chemoreceptor cells."

"15060608","abstracttext","Genetic stocks were developed for the localization and eventual cloning of the stem rust resistance gene SrR that occurs in wheat lines carrying the 1RS translocation from Secale cereale 'Imperial' rye. We have used a mutation-based approach for molecular analysis of the SrR region in rye. Forty-one independent mutants resulting in loss of SrR resistance were isolated: many of these were deletions of various sizes that were used to locate SrR with respect to chromosome group 1S markers. The analysis of the mutants showed that markers about 1 Mb apart flanking the barley Mla locus also flank SrR. Additionally, three of the approximately 20 closely related sequences of Mla in rye are deleted in each of six interstitial deletion mutants of SrR. The results indicate that the SrR region in rye is syntenic to the Mla region in barley or that SrR is possibly orthologous to the Mla locus."

"16275671","abstracttext","The cytosolic free-calcium concentration [Ca2+](cyt) transiently increases under abiotic stresses and the proteins that control this process are gradually disclosed. The Ca2+-permeable channel is one type of these proteins in plants. In the present study, a novel Ca2+-permeable channel gene TaTPC1 encoding a putative membrane protein was cloned from wheat. It was induced under high salinity, polyethylene glycol, low temperature (4 degrees C), and abscisic acid. Expression of TaTPC1 in the yeast mutant lacking CCH1 can recover its growth under lithium stress through functional complementation. TaTPC1 transgenic plants exhibited more stomatal closing in the presence of Ca2+ than the control, supporting a role for the calcium channel in regulating plant responses to environmental change."

"16278507","abstracttext","The aim of the present study was to detect candidate DNA markers for selected leaf rust resistance genes. A total number of 286 loci in the 'Thatcher' near-isogenic lines carrying resistance gene Lr1, Lr9, Lr10, Lr13, Lr19, Lr21, Lr24, Lr26, Lr28, Lr35, and Lr37 were screened for DNA polymorphism by the PstIAFLP method. A survey with 33 selective primers yielded 16 candidate markers. Further validation studies on cultivars characterized for the presence and absence of selected resistance genes confirmed specificity of markers for Lr24, Lr26 and Lr37. The AFLP-based marker P42-530 was successfully converted into an STS marker. The new marker was linked with the Lr37-specific marker (CslVrga13) at the distance of 1.7 cM.

We also amplified and cloned PCR products from total DNA isolated from the same soil samples. The total diversity within the resulting clone libraries (Sigma 218 clones) was higher than that recovered from trap plants, but differed depending on the PCR protocols and primers used. However, some plant-selected genotypes could not be obtained using the community approach, probably due to variable detection limits and limited clone library sizes."

Hence, the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region was transformed to a completely new polypeptide. Based on this finding, 7 additional recombinant prolamin genes of similar structure were isolated with specific PCR primers. The 8 chimeric clones seem to be derived from 4 individual gamma-gliadin and 3 LMW-glutenin sequences. These genes show remarkable diversity in size, gliadin:glutenin ratio, frameshift mutations, and sulphur content. The putative functional characteristics of the chimeric polypeptides and problems related to the origin of the encoding genes are discussed."

"16479170","abstracttext","The retinoblastoma (RB) protein family plays a conserved and inhibitory role in cell cycle progression in higher eukaryotes. In mammals, this family includes, in addition to RB, the related (RBR) proteins p107 and p130, which appear to have both specific and redundant functions compared to those of the prototypical RB protein. Whereas most plant species seem to possess only one RBR gene, a recent study has shown that in maize there are two types of distinctly regulated RBR proteins, RBR1 and RBR3. Expression of RBR3 RNA is controlled by the RBR1-E2F pathway, and it is upregulated upon inhibition of RBR1 activity by the wheat dwarf virus RepA protein in tissue culture, indicating the presence of a specific compensatory mechanism sustaining high pocket protein activity. Database mining and phylogenetic analyses suggest the presence of two distinct RBR genes to be a unique feature of grasses among plants, which might help to explain their recalcitrance to genetic transformation."

Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis of the representative strain LP33T indicated that these strains belong to the genus Lactobacillus and that they formed a branch distinct from their closest relatives Lactobacillus farciminis, Lactobacillus alimentarius, Lactobacillus paralimentarius and Lactobacillus mindensis. DNA-DNA reassociation experiments with the three phylogenetically closest Lactobacillus species confirmed that LP33T (= DSM 16982T = CIP 108546T = TMW 1.1265T) represents the type strain of a novel species, for which the name Lactobacillus nantensis sp. nov. is proposed."

"16702853","abstracttext","Coeliac disease (CD) is an enteropathy caused by an immune reaction towards wheat gluten and similar proteins from barley and rye. It was shown that some gluten peptides spontaneously form N-terminal L-pyroglutamate. This modification could potentially make gluten more resistant to proteolytic degradation within the intestine. Pyroglutamyl-peptidase I (PGPEPI) is an enzyme that hydrolytically removes the L-pyroglutamyl residues that render the modified proteins and peptides more sensitive to degradation by other proteases. Interestingly, we found that the PGPEP1 gene is located in a CD susceptibility locus. As an impaired enzyme function caused by genetic alterations might increase the amount of immunogenic gluten peptides, we conducted a comprehensive functional genomics analysis of PGPEP1, including DNA sequencing, genetic association testing, and quantifying RNA expression. We also determined the enzymatic activity of PGPEPI in duodenal biopsies. Our results uniformly indicate that PGPEP1 is not involved in the aetiology and pathology of CD."

Phylogenetic analyses based on the phlD sequences of 70 isolates supported the previous classification into 18 BOX-PCR genotypes (A-Q and T). Exploiting polymorphisms within the sequence of phlD, we designed and used allele-specific PCR primers with a PCR-based dilution endpoint assay to quantify the population sizes of A-, B-, D-, K-, L- and P-genotype strains grown individually or in pairs in vitro, in the rhizosphere of wheat and in bulk soil. Except for P. fluorescens Q8r1-96, which strongly inhibited the growth of P. fluorescens Q2-87, inhibition between pairs of strains grown in vitro did not affect the accuracy of the method. The allele-specific primer-based technique is a rapid method for studies of the interactions between genotypes of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol producers in natural environments."

The RPS18C leader mediated CIT as demonstrated by dicistronic constructs consisting of luciferase and chloramphenicol acetyl transferase reporter genes in an in vitro wheat germ extract system. CIT was rapidly inhibited upon addition of an oligonucleotide that competed for the 18S rRNA site complementary to the RPS18C leader and interfered with polysome assembly at the transcript."

"19233233","abstracttext","Rust fungi are obligate parasites and cannot be routinely cultured to obtain sufficient biomass for DNA extractions. Multiple displacement amplification (MDA) was demonstrated in this study for whole genome amplification from single spores of the rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis. The genomic DNA coverage and fidelity of this method was evaluated by PCR amplification and sequencing of two genetic markers: portions of the multi-copy nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and the single copy beta-tubulin gene from two geographical diverse isolates. Our results show that MDA is a valuable tool for whole genome amplification from single spores, and we propose that MDA-amplified DNA can be used for molecular genetic analysis of the wheat yellow rust fungus."

"19170501","abstracttext","Suppression of postprandial hyperglycemia reduces lipogenic enzyme activities in the adipose tissues of normal rats. The present study investigated the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and insulin sensitivity in mesenteric adipose and epididymal adipose tissues to evaluate the effects of wheat albumin (WA) and a crude preparation of WA (CWA) with alpha-amylase inhibitory activity on lipid metabolism. Rats fed 2.5% WA, which had 12.7-fold inhibitory activity compared with CWA, exhibited reduced mRNA levels for G6PDH, ACO, ACS, PEPCK, and LPL in the mesenteric adipose, but not in the epididymal adipose tissue. Linear regression analyses showed that the gene expression levels of FAS, G6PDH, ACS, and LPL were reduced in dose-dependent manners in the mesenteric adipose tissue of rats fed the CWA diet. These results suggest that supplementation with CWA as well as WA reduces the expression of genes related to lipogenesis and insulin sensitivity in mesenteric adipose tissue."

"19047000","abstracttext","Contamination of cereals with Fusarium species is one of the major sources of mycotoxins in food and feed. Quantification of biomass of Fusarium species is essential to understand the interactions of individual species in disease development. In this study quantitative real-time PCR assays based on the elongation factor 1 alpha (EF1alpha) gene for the 11 Fusarium species F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. poae, F. langsethiae, F. sporotrichioides, F. equiseti, F. tricinctum, F. avenaceum, F. verticillioides, F. subglutinans and F. proliferatum were developed and tested on 24 wheat and 24 maize field samples. The assays were found to be specific and sensitive. Generally, the results from the quantitative real-time PCR assays corresponded well with mycotoxin data of the field samples."

"18926918","abstracttext","With the increase of sequenced fungal genomes, high-throughput methods for functional analyses of genes are needed. We assessed the potential of a new transposon mutagenesis tool deploying a Fusarium oxysporum miniature inverted-repeat transposable element mimp1, mobilized by the transposase of impala, a Tc1-like transposon, to obtain knock-out mutants in Fusarium graminearum. We localized 91 mimp1 insertions which showed good distribution over the entire genome. The main exception was a major hotspot on chromosome 2 where independent insertions occurred at exactly the same nucleotide position. Furthermore insertions in promoter regions were over-represented. Screening 331 mutants for sexual development, radial growth and pathogenicity on wheat resulted in 19 mutants (5.7%) with altered phenotypes. Complementation with the original gene restored the wild-type phenotype in two selected mutants demonstrating the high tagging efficiency. This is the first report of a MITE transposon tagging system as an efficient mutagenesis tool in F. graminearum."

"17391792","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a disease of small-grain cereals and corn caused by a complex of fungal species of the genus Fusarium. The disease reduces the yield and quality of seeds and results in the accumulation of various mycotoxins which cause a variety of toxic effects on humans and livestock. Beauvericin (BEA) and enniatins (ENs) are a group of toxins with antimicrobial, insecticidal and phytotoxic activities produced mainly by F. avenaceum, F. poae and F. tricinctum. In this study, primer sets were designed that were targeted to esyn1 gene homologs encoding multifunctional enzyme enniatin synthetase. Primers used in multiplex PCR amplified products from the FHB species reported to produce (ENs) and/or BEA. The use of the marker developed on asymptomatic wheat seed samples originating from Northern and Southern Poland demonstrated that all samples were positive for the presence of potential enniatin-producing Fusarium species."

"17073308","abstracttext","The dimorphic ascomycete pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola switches from a yeastlike form to an infectious filamentous form that penetrates the host foliage through stomata. We examined the biological function of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-encoding gene MgHog1 in M. graminicola. Interestingly, MgHog1 mutants were unable to switch to filamentous growth on water agar that mimics the nutritionally poor conditions on the foliar surface and, hence, exclusively developed by a yeastlike budding process. Consequently, due to impaired initiation of infectious germ tubes, as revealed by detailed in planta cytological analyses, the MgHog1 mutants failed to infect wheat leaves. We, therefore, conclude that MgHog1 is a new pathogenicity factor involved in the regulation of dimorphism in M. graminicola. Furthermore, MgHog1 mutants are osmosensitive, resistant to phenylpyrrole and dicarboximide fungicides, and do not melanize."

"17477281","abstracttext","The detection of potentially allergenic foods, such as sesame seeds, in food products is a major concern for the food-processing industry. A real-time PCR method was designed to determine if sesame seed DNA is present in food products. The PCR reaction amplifies a 66-bp fragment of the sesame seed 2S albumin gene, which is detected with a sesame-specific, dual-labeled TaqMan probe. This reaction will not amplify DNA derived from other seeds present in baked goods, such as pumpkin, poppy, and sunflower seeds. Additionally, this assay will not cross-react with DNA from several tree nut species, such as almond, Brazil nut, cashew, hazelnut, and walnut, as well as four varieties of peanut. This assay is sensitive enough to detect 5 pg of purified sesame seed DNA, as well as sesame seed DNA in a spiked wheat cracker sample."

"16751703","abstracttext","The effect of the consumption of hypoallergenic wheat flour (HWF) on the expression of a wide spectrum of genes was analyzed by using a DNA microarray. Gene expression profiles in the liver and intestines of rats fed on a diet composed mainly of HWF were compared with those of rats fed on a normal flour-based diet. Among the eight thousand transcripts represented on the GeneChip microarray, no more than 30 genes exhibited up- or down-regulation of two-fold or more after one week or two months of HWF consumption. No adverse effects were apparent. Up-regulation of some of the genes known to respond to the interferon-gamma signal was apparent in the one-week experiment, which may be related to possible oral immunotolerance resulting from HWF feeding. This DNA microarray technology presents an efficient method for evaluating the safety of foods."

"18194165","abstracttext","Drawing a direct connection between adaptive evolution at the phenotypic level and underlying genetic factors has long been a major goal of evolutionary biologists, but the genetic characterization of adaptive traits in natural populations is notoriously difficult. The study of evolution in experimental populations offers some help - initial conditions are known and changes can be tracked for extended periods under conditions more controlled than wild populations and more realistic than laboratory or greenhouse experiments. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, researchers studying experimental wheat populations over a 12-year period have demonstrated evolution in a major adaptive trait, flowering time, and parallel changes in underlying genetic variation (Rhoné et al. 2008). Their work suggests that cis-regulatory mutations at a single gene may explain most of the flowering time variation in these populations."

"17686457","abstracttext","Plant genomic projects, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and maize, have provided excellent tools for comparative genome analysis on Base Excision DNA Repair (BER). A data-mining study associated with the SUCEST Genome project identified two EST clusters that shared homology to the bacteria MutM/Fpg protein. Comparative analyses presented here show a duplication of the MutM/Fpg gene in sugarcane, wheat and rice. The complementation assays show that both cDNAs from sugarcane are able to complement the Fpg and MutY-glycosylase deficiency in a double mutant Escherichia coli strain (CC104mutMmutY), reducing the spontaneous mutation frequency by 10-fold. The expression analyses by semi-quantitative RT-PCR show that these two mRNAs have different expression levels."

"16664870","abstracttext","Western blots of soluble protein from wheat, rice, and corn showed that ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase subunits have a size of 50 kilodaltons from endosperm tissue and 43 and 46 kilodaltons from leaf. Antisera to ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase precipitated in vitro translation products of 73 and 76 kilodaltons when leaf poly(A)(+) RNA was used, whereas endosperm mRNA directed the synthesis of 50 and 56 kilodalton polypeptides. To further study the nature of these mRNA species, an ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase cDNA clone from rice endosperm polyadenylated RNA was obtained and used as a hybridization probe. Northern blots showed that ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase mRNA was slightly larger in leaf (2100 bases) than in endosperm tissue (1900 bases). These studies indicated that in cereals there are at least two tissue specific forms of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase that are encoded by distinct mRNA transcripts. Analysis of genomic DNA by Southern blotting suggested that ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase is encoded by a small gene family."

This approach revealed NHR binding to natural response elements and new heterodimeric NHR-HRE bindings. We analyzed 408 possible binding combinations between 34 human NHRs and 12 different HREs, and identified 205 NHR-HRE binding combinations, 124 of which have not been previously reported. Thus, this study provides a novel biochemical classification of the human NHRs, as well as describing a novel approach to the large-scale analysis of DNA-protein interactions."

"20377623","abstracttext","Although it is now established that sensory neurons in both the main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ may be activated by both general and pheromonal odorants, it remains unclear what initiates sampling by the vomeronasal organ. Anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase was used to determine that adequate intranasal syringing with zinc sulfate interrupted all inputs to the main olfactory bulb but left intact those to the accessory olfactory bulb. Adult male treated mice were frankly anosmic when tested with pheromonal and non-pheromonal odors and failed to engage in aggressive behavior. Treated juvenile females failed to show puberty acceleration subsequent to exposure to bedding from adult males. Activation of the immediate early gene c-Fos and electrovomeronasogram recording confirmed the integrity of the vomeronasal system in zinc sulfate-treated mice. These results support the hypothesis that odor detection by the main olfactory epithelium is required to initiate sampling by the vomeronasal system."

Twenty-nine strains of Aspergillus flavus were screened for their ability to produce aflatoxins (AFs). Four strains produced only aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), two strains produced AFB1 and aflatoxin B2, and one strain produced AFB1, aflatoxin G1, and aflatoxin G2. Random amplified polymorphic DNA-polymerase chain reaction technique could not differentiate between toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of A. flavus.

"19686106","abstracttext","Neural pathways conveying taste information from the tongue to the brain underlie gustatory information coding and processing. To visualize the gustatory neural pathways, we established transgenic mouse lines in which a transneuronal tracer, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), was faithfully and robustly expressed in sweet/umami taste receptor cells (TRCs) under the control of mouse T1R3 gene promoter/enhancer. WGA protein was transferred not laterally to the cells with synaptic structure, but directly to a subset of neurons in the geniculate and nodose/petrosal ganglia, and further conveyed to a subpopulation of neurons in the rostro-central region of the nucleus of the solitary tract. However, no WGA immunoreactivity was observed in more central gustatory relay nuclei even in the parabrachial nucleus. These results imply that sweet/umami information from TRCs can be directly transmitted to the gustatory neurons that innervate the sweet/umami TRCs, and this study uncovered a precise map of the sweet/umami information pathway from TRCs to the nucleus of solitary tract in the brain stem."
"19704698","articletitle","A hydrogen peroxide detoxification system in the nucleus of wheat seed cells: protection or signaling role?"
"19704698","abstracttext","Aerobic metabolism inevitably produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), including hydrogen peroxide, which may cause damage to the cell. Besides this toxic effect, hydrogen peroxide has an important signaling function in plant development and response to environmental stimuli. So, the balance of toxic and signaling effects of hydrogen peroxide is highly dependent on mechanisms to adjust its level in the different cell compartments. We recently described a redox system, formed by NADPH thioredoxin reductase (NTR) and 1-Cys peroxiredoxin (1-Cys Prx), able to use the reducing power of NADPH to reduce hydrogen peroxide. This system is localized in the nucleus of wheat seed cells and probably has an important antioxidant function in aleurone and scutellum cells, which suffer oxidative stress during seed development and germination. We discuss here the possibility that the control of the level of hydrogen peroxide in the nucleus may be important to balance redox regulation of gene expression and cell death in cereal seed cells."

"22649303","abstracttext","We present an experiment done on a bar(+) wheat line treated with 14 different concentrations of glufosinate ammonium-an effective component of nonselective herbicides-during seed germination in a closed experimental system. Yield components as number of spikes per plant, number of grains per spike, thousand kernel weight, and yield per plant were thoroughly analysed and statistically evaluated after harvesting. We found that a concentration of glufosinate ammonium 5000 times the lethal dose was not enough to inhibit the germination of transgenic plants expressing the bar gene. Extremely high concentrations of glufosinate ammonium caused a bushy phenotype, significantly lower numbers of grains per spike, and thousand kernel weights. Concerning the productivity, we observed that concentrations of glufosinate ammonium 64 times the lethal dose did not lead to yield depression. Our results draw attention to the possibilities implied in the transgenic approaches."

"23339832","abstracttext","In the past few years, mathematical modeling approaches in biology have begun to fulfill their promise by assisting in the dissection of complex biological systems. Here, we review two recent examples of predictive mathematical modeling in plant biology. The first involves the quantitative epigenetic silencing of the floral repressor gene FLC in Arabidopsis, mediated by a Polycomb-based system. The second involves the spatiotemporal dynamics of telomere bouquet formation in wheat-rye meiosis. Although both the biology and the modeling framework of the two systems are different, both exemplify how mathematical modeling can help to accelerate discovery of the underlying mechanisms in complex biological systems. In both cases, the models that developed were relatively minimal, including only essential features, but both nevertheless yielded fundamental insights. We also briefly review the current state of mathematical modeling in biology, difficulties inherent in its application, and its potential future development."

To overcome these limitations and help rice phenomics more closely parallel rice genomics, reliable, automatic, multifunctional, and high-throughput phenotyping platforms should be developed. In this article, we discuss the key plant phenotyping technologies, particularly photonics-based technologies, and then introduce their current applications in rice (wheat or barley) phenomics. We also note the major challenges in rice phenomics and are confident that these reliable high-throughput phenotyping tools will give plant scientists new perspectives on the information encoded in the rice genome."

The sequencing and annotation of the 1.59-Mbp replicon of A. brasilense CBG497, a strain isolated from a maize rhizosphere grown on an alkaline soil in the northeast of Mexico, revealed a GC content of 68.7 % and the presence of 1,430 potential protein-encoding genes, 1,147 of them classified into clusters of orthologous groups categories, and 16 tRNA genes representing 11 tRNA species. The presence of sixty-two genes representatives of the minimal gene set and chromid core genes suggests its importance in bacterial survival. The phaAB → G operon, reported as involved in the bacterial adaptation to alkaline pH in the presence of K(+), was also found on this replicon and detected in several Azospirillum strains. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that it was laterally acquired. We were not able to show its inference on the adaptation to basic pH, giving a hint about the presence of an alternative system for adaptation to alkaline pH."

"22615891","abstracttext","The geographic distribution of genetic diversity and the population structure of tetraploid wheat landraces in the Mediterranean basin has received relatively little attention. This is complicated by the lack of consensus concerning the taxonomy of tetraploid wheats and by unresolved questions regarding the domestication and spread of naked wheats. These knowledge gaps hinder crop diversity conservation efforts and plant breeding programmes. We investigated genetic diversity and population structure in tetraploid wheats (wild emmer, emmer, rivet and durum) using nuclear and chloroplast simple sequence repeats, functional variations and insertion site-based polymorphisms. Emmer and wild emmer constitute a genetically distinct population from durum and rivet, the latter seeming to share a common gene pool. Our population structure and genetic diversity data suggest a dynamic history of introduction and extinction of genotypes in the Mediterranean fields."

"20685306","abstracttext","The developing world has many unique constraints to crop production and, lacking inputs, they are best overcome if solutions are seed borne. Classical breeding cannot overcome many of these constraints because the species have attained a 'genetic glass ceiling', the genes are not available within the species. Transgenics can supply the genes, but typically not as 'hand me down genes' from the developed world because of the unique problems: mainly parasitic weeds, and weedy rice, stem borers and post-harvest insects, viral diseases, tropical mycotoxins, anti-feedants, toxic heavy metals and mineral deficiencies. Public sector involvement is imperative for genetically engineering against these constraints, as the private biotechnology sector does not see the developing world as a viable market in most instances. Rice, sorghum, barley, wheat and millets have related weeds, and in certain cases, transgenic gene containment and/or mitigation is necessary to prevent establishment of transgenes in the weedy relatives."

The enzyme showed maximal activity at pH 7.5 and 55 °C, maintained more than 50% of maximal activity when assayed at pH 9.0, and was stable over a wide pH range from 4.0 to 11.0. The specific activity of AWS-2x towards hardwood xylan (beechwood and birchwood xylan) was significantly higher than that to cereal xylan (oat spelt xylan and wheat arabinoxylan). These properties make AWS-2x a potential candidate for application in the pulp and paper industry."

After 72 h of fermentation by the Y. lipolytica transformant in the fed-batch fermentor, the fermentation broth accumulated 41.11 U/ml esterase activity. Rice bran, wheat bran, bagasse and corncob were used as hydrolysis substrates for the esterase, with corncob giving the best ferulic acid yield. The corncob was incubated with T. fusca xylanase (Tfx) for 12h and then with the AXE esterase for an additional 12h. Ferulic acid accumulated to 396 μM in the culture broth, a higher concentration than with esterase alone or with Tfx and esterase together for 24 h."
"22118614","articletitle","Current advances in the investigation of leaf rolling caused by biotic and abiotic stress factors."
"22118614","abstracttext","Leaf rolling is known as a typical response to water deficit in numerous species such as rice, maize, wheat and sorghum. However, it results not only from the water deficit but also from other abiotic stress factors such as salt, temperature, heavy metals and UV radiation. In addition to the abiotic factors, herbivores, viruses, bacteria and fungi are biotic factors of leaf rolling. Leaf rolling is an effective protective mechanism from the effects of high light levels in agricultural fields and protects leaves of unirrigated plants from photodamage. The rolling reduces effective leaf area and transpiration, and thus is a potentially useful drought avoidance mechanism in dry areas. The current review focuses on the recent progress in understanding leaf rolling in relation to abiotic and biotic stress factors, the role of signal molecules, and the mechanisms of gene regulation."

"22056429","abstracttext","We identified a gene product of At5g19500 (At5g19500p) from Arabidopsis thaliana that is homologous to EcTyrP, a tyrosine-specific transporter from Escherichia coli. Computational analyses of the amino acid sequence of At5g19500p predicted 11 transmembrane domains (TMDs) and a potential plastid targeting signal at its amino terminus. As a first step toward understanding the possible role of At5g19500p in plant cells, we attempted to determine the localization of At5g19500p by an in vitro chloroplastic import assay using At5g19500p translated in a cell-free wheat germ system (Madin et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 97, 559-564 (2000)), followed by subfractionation of the chloroplasts. At5g19500p was successfully imported into chloroplasts, and the newly transported mature form of At5g19500p was recovered from the inner envelope membrane."

"23287498","abstracttext","The cDNA of acetyl xylan esterase 2 (PcAxe2) gene containing a carbohydrate binding module (CBM) sequence from Phanerochaete chrysosporium was cloned and expressed in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant PcAxe2 protein (rPcAxe2) was efficiently produced, reaching a maximum of 1058 U l(-1) after 6 days of cultivation. Molecular mass of the rPcAxe2 on SDS-PAGE was approximately 63 kDa under hyperglycosylation. Optimal activity of the purified rPcAxe2 enzyme was observed at pH and temperature of 7.0 and 30-35°C, respectively. In addition to acetyl xylan esterase activity, rPcAxe2 also exhibited a xylanase activity at an optimum pH and temperature of 5.0 and 80°C, respectively. The synergistic action of rPcAxe2 with rPcXynC on birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan and wheat arabinoxylan enhanced the total reducing soluble sugar."

"23320867","abstracttext","Herbaspirillum seropedicae Z67 is a diazotrophic endophyte able to colonize the interior of many economically relevant crops such as rice, wheat, corn and sorghum. Structures of siderophores produced by bacterial endophytes have not yet been elucidated. The aim of this work was to identify and characterize the siderophores produced by this bacterium. In a screening for mutants unable to produce siderophores we found a mutant that had a transposon insertion in a non-ribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS) gene coding for a putative siderophore biosynthetic enzyme. The chemical structure of the siderophore was predicted using computational genomic tools. The predicted structure was confirmed by chemical analysis. We found that siderophores produced by H. seropedicae Z67 are a suite of amphiphilic lipopeptides, named serobactin A, B and C, which vary by the length of the fatty acid chain. We also demonstrated the biological activity of serobactins as nutritional iron sources for H. seropedicae. These are the first structurally described siderophores produced by endophytic bacteria."

"23247911","abstracttext","Significant differences in the two-dimensional electrophoresis patterns of proteins from developing rye grain were found to be associated with resistance and susceptibility to preharvest sprouting (PHS). Mass spectrometry of individual spots showing different abundance in PHS-resistant and PHS-susceptible lines identified proteins involved in: reaction to biotic and abiotic stresses, including oxidative stress, energy metabolism and regulation of gene expression. Highly differentiated abundance of proteins found in developing grain suggest that the diversification of processes leading to developing PHS resistance or PHS susceptibility starts from an early stage of grain development. A part of the identified proteins in rye grain were also reported to be associated with PHS in wheat and rice, which suggests that some mechanisms affecting precocious germination might be common for different cereal species."

"23619014","articletitle","The molecular basis of vernalization in different plant groups."
"23619014","abstracttext","Timing of flowering is key to the reproductive success of many plants. In temperate climates, flowering is often coordinated with seasonal environmental cues such as temperature and photoperiod. Vernalization, the process by which a prolonged exposure to the cold of winter results in competence to flower during the following spring, is an example of the influence of temperature on the timing of flowering. In different groups of plants, there are distinct genes involved in vernalization, indicating that vernalization systems evolved independently in different plant groups. The convergent evolution of vernalization systems is not surprising given that angiosperm families had begun to diverge in warmer paleoclimates in which a vernalization response was not advantageous. Here, we review what is known of the vernalization response in three different plant groups: crucifers (Arabidopsis), Amaranthaceae (sugar beet), and Pooideae (wheat, barley, and Brachypodium distachyon). We also discuss the advantages of using Brachypodium as a model system to study flowering and vernalization in the Pooids. Finally, we discuss the evolution and function of the Ghd7/VRN2 gene family in grasses."

"23586992","abstracttext","Mycosphaerella graminicola is a key fungal pathogen of wheat and a major target for azole fungicides, many of whose central mode of action is through inhibition of cytochrome P450 51 (lanosterol 14α-demethylase) in the ergosterol biosynthetic pathway. The range of activities of other fungal CYPs is thought to be a reflection of the differences between different organisms and their range of secondary metabolic pathways as a response to their niche environments, for example, in the production of mycotoxins. The present study collates information from a range of databases, to classify the CYPs found in M. graminicola and assign them an internationally recognized nomenclature, which, when referenced to the recent publication of the JGI version 2.0 genome model, creates a current, robust model for the CYP complement (CYPome) of M. graminicola. These CYPome data, which examined 82 CYPs and one pseudo-gene, may be utilized not only to further characterize and describe the physiology of the organism but also to enhance our understanding of CYP function and diversity."

It displayed excellent cold adaptation over a low temperature range of 10-30°C, retaining over 85% of its relative activity. RmGBE showed the highest specificity to amylose, about ten times higher than to amylopectin. Addition of RmGBE to wheat bread resulted in a 26% increase in specific volume and a 38% decrease in crumb firmness in comparison with the control. Besides, the retrogradation of bread was significantly retarded along with the enzyme reaction. These properties make RmGBE highly useful in the food and starch industries."

"24904617","abstracttext","Nuclear-mitochondrial (NM) communication impacts many aspects of plant development including vigor, sterility, and viability. Dynamic changes in mitochondrial number, shape, size, and cellular location takes place during the cell cycle possibly impacting the process itself and leading to distribution of this organelle into daughter cells. The genes that underlie these changes are beginning to be identified in model plants such as Arabidopsis. In animals disruption of the drp1 gene, a homolog to the plant drp3A and drp3B, delays mitochondrial division. This mutation results in increased aneuploidy due to chromosome mis-segregation. It remains to be discovered if a similar outcome is observed in plants. Alloplasmic lines provide an opportunity to understand the communication between the cytoplasmic organelles and the nucleus. Examples of studies in these lines, especially from the extensive collection in wheat, point to the role of mitochondria in chromosome movement, pollen fertility and other aspects of development."

Blocks include components differing in their electrophoretic mobility and molecular weight. Some allelic variants of blocks differ only in presence of few additional components or in the electrophoretic mobility of components with similar molecular weights; other variants may contain no similar components.

The initial step of the degradation pathway is to hydrolyze the carboxylic acid ester bond. A novel esterase gene feh, encoding the FE-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase (FeH) responsible for this initial step, was cloned from strain JPL-2. Its molecular mass was approximately 39 kDa, and the catalytic efficiency of FeH followed the order of FE > quizalofop-P-ethyl > clodinafop-propargyl > cyhalofop-butyl > fluazifop-P-butyl > haloxyfop-P-methyl > diclofop-methy, which indicated that the chain length of the alcohol moiety strongly affected the hydrolysis activity of the FeH toward AOPP herbicides."

Gene ontology analysis of drought-responsive proteins (DRPs) suggested an induction of proteins related to cell wall biogenesis, ATP synthesis, photosynthesis, and carbohydrate/energy metabolism in leaves under stress condition. A large fraction of root proteins were identified to be involved in defense and oxidative stress response. In addition, a significant change was detected in proteins related to protein synthesis, ATP synthesis, and germin-like proteins in response to drought stress. A detailed analysis of this data may be obtained from Ref. [1]."

"26828593","abstracttext","A number of cereals produce the benzoxazolinone class of phytoalexins. Fusarium species pathogenic towards these hosts can typically degrade these compounds via an aminophenol intermediate, and the ability to do so is encoded by a group of genes found in the Fusarium Detoxification of Benzoxazolinone (FDB) cluster. A zinc finger transcription factor encoded by one of the FDB cluster genes (FDB3) has been proposed to regulate the expression of other genes in the cluster and hence is potentially involved in benzoxazolinone degradation. Herein we show that Fdb3 is essential for the ability of Fusarium pseudograminearum to efficiently detoxify the predominant wheat benzoxazolinone, 6-methoxy-benzoxazolin-2-one (MBOA), but not benzoxazoline-2-one (BOA). Furthermore, additional genes thought to be part of the FDB gene cluster, based upon transcriptional response to benzoxazolinones, are regulated by Fdb3. However, deletion mutants for these latter genes remain capable of benzoxazolinone degradation, suggesting that they are not essential for this process."

"26505308","abstracttext","A hybrid sensor kinase termed RetS (regulator of exopolysaccharide and Type III secretion) controls expression of numerous genes in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. To investigate the function of RetS in P. fluorescens FD6, the retS gene was disrupted. Genetic inactivation of retS resulted in enhanced production of 2, 4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyrrolnitrin, and pyoluteorin. The retS mutant also exhibited significant increase in phlA-lacZ, prnA-lacZ, and pltA-lacZ transcription levels, influencing expression levels of the small regulatory RNAs RsmX and RsmZ. In the gacSretS double mutant, all the phenotypic changes caused by the retS deletion were reversed to the level of gacS single mutant. Furthermore, the retS mutation drastically elevated biofilm formation and improved the colonization ability of strain FD6 on wheat rhizospheres. Based on these results, we proposed that RetS negatively controlled the production of antibiotics through the Gac/Rsm pathway in P. fluorescens FD6."

The engineering strain could produce the crude enzyme with more alkali-tolerant EG and little PFA. Potential of the crude enzyme in modification of different pulps were investigated. It was found that the enzyme could be used for improving drainage and strength properties of pulps from softwood, hardwood and non-wood materials, especially non-wood pulp such as wheat straw pulp. The underlying mechanisms of pulp modification and different effects on various types of pulps by the EG treatment were also discussed by studying the change in fibers characteristics and fiber bonding."

Sequence analysis of TlXyn10A identified seven residues probably involved in substrate contacting. Three mutants (TlXyn10A_P, _N and _C) were then constructed by substituting some or all of the residues with corresponding ones of hyperthermal Xyl10C from Bispora sp. MEY-1. TlXyn10A_P with mutations at subsites +2 to +4 exhibited improved specific activity (by 0.44-fold) and pH stability (2.0-10.0). Molecular dynamics simulation analysis indicated that mutations E229I and F232E probably weaken the substrate affinity at subsites +3 to +4, and G149D may introduce a new hydrogen bond. These modifications altogether account for the improved performance of TlXyn10A_P. Moreover, TlXyn10A_P was able to hydrolyze wheat straw persistently, and has the application potentials in various industries."

One of the most effective ways to identify SAGs is to screen for candidate genes using massive genome-scale transcriptomic data such as microarray, RNA-seq, digital RNA expression level data, etc. The basic functional analysis of candidate genes is to observe the phenotypes of transgenic plants, in which the candidate SAGs are overexpressed, knocked down, or knocked out. In this chapter, we outline methods for identifying and characterizing SAGs by microarray analysis in wheat. Methods of gene functional analyses by screening transgenic plants are also described. The protocols described in this chapter could also be used in other plant species, especially for Poaceae plants."

"28324580","abstracttext","The bacterial strain producing thermostable, alklophilic alpha-amylase was identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens KCP2 using 16S rDNA gene sequencing data (NCBI Accession No: KF112071). Medium components were optimized through the statistical approach for the synthesis of alpha-amylase by the organism under solid-state fermentation using wheat bran as the substrate. The medium components influencing the enzyme production were identified using a two-level fractional factorial Plackett-Burman design. Among the various variables screened, starch, ammonium sulphate and calcium chloride were found to be most significant medium components. The optimum levels of these significant parameters were determined employing the response surface Central Composite design which significantly increased the enzyme production with the supplementation of starch 0.01 g, ammonium sulphate 0.2 g and 5 mM calcium chloride in the production medium. Temperature and pH stability of the alpha-amylase suggested its wide application in the food and pharmaceutical industries."

"28234336","abstracttext","Putrescine, spermidine and spermine are the most abundant polycationic natural amines found in nearly all organisms. They are involved in regulation of gene expression, translation, cell proliferation and differentiation. They can be supplied by the endogenous synthesis inside the cell or by the intake from exogenous sources. There is a growing body of literature associated with the effects of bioactive amines on health and diseases, but limited information about polyamine content in foods is available. In the present study, the polyamine content of frequently consumed foods in a typical Turkish diet was estimated for adults, including tea, bread and yoghurt. The estimation of daily intake was defined as 93,057 nmol/day putrescine, 33,122 nmol/day spermidine, 13,685 nmol/day spermine. The contribution of foods to daily intake was: dairy products (47.32%), vegetables and grains (21.09%) and wheat products (12.75%)."

"29079075","abstracttext","Phospholipase D (PLD) is an important phospholipid hydrolase that plays critical roles in various biological processes in eukaryotic cells. However, little is known about its functions in plant pathogenic fungi. In this study, we identified three FgPLD genes in Fusarium graminearum that are homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Spo14 gene. We constructed deletion mutants of all three FgPLD genes using homologous recombination. Deletion of FgPLD1 (Δpld1), but not FgPLD2 or FgPLD3, affected hyphal growth, conidiation, and perithecium formation. The Δpld1 mutant showed reduced deoxynivalenol (DON) production and virulence in flowering wheat heads and corn silks. Furthermore, three FgPLD proteins have the same subcellular localization and localize to the cytoplasm in F. graminearum. Taken together, these results indicate that FgPLD1, but not FgPLD2 or FgPLD3, is important for hyphal growth, sexual or asexual reproduction, and plant infection."

A polyphasic study was carried out to establish the taxonomic position of the two strains. Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the isolates coincided with the genus Glycomyces. Sequences analysis of the 16S rRNA gene also showed that the organisms belong to the genus Glycomyces and Glycomyces algeriensis is the highest sequence match for both strains. Furthermore, a combination of DNA-DNA hybridization results and some differential physiological and biochemical properties indicated that they were distinguishable from the phylogenetically closest relatives.

We report herein for the first time the genome sequence of F. culmorum strain PV and its associated secondary metabolome that plays a role in the interaction with other microorganisms and contributes to its pathogenicity on plants. The genome revealed the presence of two terpene synthases, trichodiene and longiborneol synthase, which generate an array of volatile terpenes. Furthermore, we identified two gene clusters, deoxynivalenol and zearalenone, which encode for the production of mycotoxins. Linking the production of mycotoxins with in vitro bioassays, we found high virulence of F. culmorum PV on maize, barley and wheat. By using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we confirmed several compounds important for the behaviour and lifestyle of F. culmorum. This research sets the basis for future studies in microbe-plant interactions."

"29751917","abstracttext","Lupine is widely used as an ingredient in diverse food products, but it is also a source of allergens. This work aimed at proposing a method to detect/quantify lupine as an allergen in processed foods based on a normalised real-time PCR assay targeting the Lup a 4 allergen-encoding gene of Lupinus albus. Sensitivities down to 0.0005%, 0.01% and 0.05% (w/w) of lupine in rice flour, wheat flour and bread, respectively, and 1 pg of L. albus DNA were obtained, with adequate real-time PCR performance parameters using the ΔCt method. Both food matrix and processing affected negatively the quantitative performance of the assay. The method was successfully validated with blind samples and applied to processed foods. Lupine was estimated between 4.12 and 22.9% in foods, with some results suggesting the common practice of precautionary labelling. In this work, useful and effective tools were proposed for the detection/quantification of lupine in food products."

The PPA titer was low due to relatively low expression of LDH, intermediate accumulation, and lack of cofactors. To address this issue, ribosome binding site regulation, gene duplication, and induction optimization were performed to increased the PLA titer to 43.8 g/L. Then co-substrates (glucose, yeast extract, and glycerol) were used to increase NADH concentration and cell stability, resulting that the PLA titer was increased to 54.0 g/L, which is the highest reported production by biocatalyst. Finally, glucose was replaced with wheat straw hydrolysate as co-substrate to decrease the cost. Notably, the strategies reported herein may be generally applicable to other whole-cell cascade biocatalysts."

Digestates were collected based on each crop type during anaerobic co-digestion of cow manure and barley, triticale, wheat and rye. Bacterial and fungal diversity in digestate composting systems were determined by 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, respectively. Crop-based composting of anaerobic digestates showed similar process trends in terms of pH, temperature, moisture content (MC) and C:N ratio. The properties of final compost products were in accordance with the national legislations regarding soil applications, except MC, which were therefore air-dried before being amended to soil.

"32290962","abstracttext","Potato plays a key role in global food and nutritional security. Potato is an N fertiliser-responsive crop, producing high tuber yields. However, excessive use of N can result in environmental damage and high production costs, hence improving nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of potato plants is one of the sustainable options to address these issues and increase yield. Advanced efforts have been undertaken to improve NUE in other plants like Arabidopsis, rice, wheat and maize through molecular and physiological approaches. Conversely, in potato, NUE studies have predominantly focussed on agronomy or soil management, except for a few researchers who have measured gene expression and proteins relevant to N uptake or metabolism. The focus of this review is to adapt knowledge gained from other plants to inform investigation of N metabolism and associated traits in potato with the aim of improving potato NUE using integrated genomics, physiology and breeding methods."
"32296449","articletitle","The Rise of the CRISPR/Cpf1 System for Efficient Genome Editing in Plants."
"32296449","abstracttext","Cpf1, an endonuclease of the class 2 CRISPR family, fills the gaps that were previously faced in the world of genome engineering tools, which include the TALEN, ZFN, and CRISPR/Cas9. Other simultaneously discovered nucleases were not able to carry out re-engineering at the same region due to the loss of a target site after first-time engineering. Cpf1 acts as a dual nuclease, functioning as an endoribonuclease to process crRNA and endodeoxyribonuclease to cleave target sequences and generate double-stranded breaks. Additionally, Cpf1 allows for multiplexed genome editing, as a single crRNA array transcript can target multiple loci in the genome. The CRISPR/Cpf1 system enables gene deletion, insertion, base editing, and locus tagging in monocot as well as in dicot plants with fewer off-target effects. This tool has been efficiently demonstrated into tobacco, rice, soybean, wheat, etc. This review covers the development and applications of Cpf1 mediated genome editing technology in plants."

"32328483","abstracttext","The novel cellobiohydrolase gene ctcel7 was identified from Chaetomium thermophilum , and its recombinant protein CtCel7, a member of glycoside hydrolase family 7, was heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris and biochemically characterized. Compared with commercial hydrolases, purified CtCel7 exhibited superior bifunctional cellobiohydrolase and xylanase activities against microcrystalline cellulose and xylan, respectively, under optimal conditions of 60°C and pH 4.0. Moreover, CtCel7 displayed remarkable thermostability with over 90% residual activity after heat (60°C) treatment for 180 min. CtCel7 was insensitive to most detected cations and reagents and preferentially cleaved the β-1,4-glycosidic bond to generate oligosaccharides through the continuous saccharification of lignocellulosic substrates, which are crucial for various practical applications. Notably, the hydrolysis effect of a commercial cellulase cocktail on pretreated wheat straw was substantively improved by its combination with CtCel7. Taken together, these excellent properties distinguish CtCel7 as a robust candidate for the biotechnological production of biofuels and biobased chemicals."

Transformants secreted active AXHd3 in compost as shown by the degradation of double substituted arabinoxylan oligomers in an in vitro assay. However, carbohydrate composition and degree of arabinosyl substitution of arabinoxylans were not affected in compost possibly due to inaccessibility of the doubly substituted xylosyl residues."
"30764335","articletitle","Emergence of Virulence to Sr25 of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici on Wheat in India."
"30764335","abstracttext","Stem (black) rust, caused by Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. & Henn., is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat. It could be controlled through introgression of race-specific resistance genes. However, such kind of resistance is mostly short lived due to emergence of new virulences. For example, resistance genes Sr11, Sr24, Sr30, and Sr31 are no longer effective (2,4). Detection of new virulences has remained vital in the evaluation and identification of new sources of resistance. We report here the detection of virulence to Sr25, a gene from Thinopyrum elongatum (4), which had been effective or partially effective against stem rust worldwide, including race Ug99 (TTKSK) (4). A stem rust isolate collected in 2006 from Karnataka (southern India) produced susceptible reactions (infection type [IT] 3+ to 4) on the primary leaves of differential genotype 'Agatha' carrying Sr25 and susceptible check 'Agra Local' at 22 ± 2°C. To verify virulence to Sr25, single-pustule isolates from this sample were inoculated onto seedlings of 'Agrus', 'Agatha', 'RL6040' ('Thatcher' + Sr25), 'Superseri#1', 'Wheatear', and 'Morocco' + Sr25 (obtained from CIMMYT), which all carry Sr25. All these accessions were found susceptible (IT 3+ to 4) to this isolate, except Wheatear which expressed resistance (IT ;1), indicating the presence of additional gene(s). These genotypes are resistant (ITs ;1 to 2+) to Sr25-avirulent pathotypes. The new pathotype is avirulent to Sr11, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 38, 39, 40, 43, and Tmp and virulent to Sr5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 9a, 9b, 9d, 9e, 9f, 9g, 10, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 28, 30, 34, 36, 42, Wld-1, and Gt at 22 ± 2°C. This pathotype has been designated as 58G13-3 and PKTSC according to the Indian nomenclature (1) and the North American system (3), respectively. It represents race 40 based on Stakman's differentials. It may have arisen from race 40 through mutation. The type culture of the pathotype has been added to the culture collection at Flowerdale, Shimla. Interestingly, 'Festiguay' (Sr30) was found resistant to this pathotype, indicating the presence of additional gene(s), whereas 'Webster' (Sr30) was susceptible. Adult plants of Agrus, Agatha, RL6040, Superseri#1, and Morocco+Sr25 also were susceptible, producing 20S to 60S responses. Sr25-avirulent pathotype 62G29 produced a TR (flecking in traces) response on these lines except Morocco + Sr25 that showed 20 to 40MR (moderately resistant) responses. In the same study however, adult plants of Thatcher showed a resistant reaction (10R to MR) at low (16 ± 2°C) and susceptible (20S) at high (22 ± 2°C) temperatures. Agatha and RL6040, having Thatcher as one of the parents, had similar responses. The detection of Sr25 virulence is significant since Sr25 is an important gene to be targeted for breeding wheat cultivars resistant to Ug99. We should use either adult plant resistance and/or pyramiding two or more genes for seedling resistance to enhance the field life of wheat cultivars. References: (1) P. Bahadur et al. Proc.

"30296206","abstracttext","Zinc (Zn) is an essential element in human nutrition. The concentration of Zn in cereals, which is a staple food in developing countries, is often too low thus contributing to Zn malnutrition in nearly two billion people worldwide. We have reported recently that transgenic barley plants expressing a cytokinin-degrading CYTOKININ OXIDASE/DEHYDROGENASE (CKX) gene in their roots form a larger root system and accumulate a higher concentration of Zn in their grains when grown under greenhouse conditions. Here, we have tested this trait under field conditions. Four independent pEPP:CKX lines accumulated an up to 30% higher Zn concentration in their grains as compared to the untransformed control suggesting that this is a stable trait. The increased Zn concentration exceeded the limit set by the HarvestPlus program for wheat. We, therefore, propose that root enhancement achieved by increased degradation of cytokinin in roots can be a sustainable strategy to combat malnutrition caused by Zn deficiency."

The purified wCat1 exhibits its highest activity at pH 7.5 and 35 °C with K m and V max of 22.95 mM and 0.24 μmol/min, respectively. wCat1 could markedly improve the farinographic properties of dough, with the stability time increasing and degree of softening decreasing, and enhance the rheological properties of dough. wCat1 could also elevate bread-making quality, with increased specific volume of the bread and decreased hardness, gumminess, and chewiness, which are attributable to increased amounts of SDS-insoluble protein in dough, resulting in extended glutenin networks and thus larger pores in the fermented dough and bread crumb. The decrease of hydrogen peroxide and increase of free thiol groups in wCat1-treated dough suggest that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide by wCat1 likely promotes disulfide-bond formation and thus the cross-linking of dough proteins."

This study deals with the identification of stem rust resistance genes in a collection of winter wheats grown in Southern Russia. This genepool has not been studied yet. A total of 620 samples of winter soft wheat from various ecological and geographical zones were tested under field conditions. To identify the specific genes or alleles responsible for resistance, all samples were genotyped using PCR. As a result, the groups of resistant samples, carrying the Sr2 , Sr31 , Sr38 and Sr44 genes in various combinations, were identified. Most of the stem rust resistance was provided by the presence of the effective Sr44 gene. This information can be used in the future breeding work for stem rust resistance."

In general, a similar evolution of microbial biodiversity was seen in both the inoculated and uninoculated (control) piles, which was in keeping with a similar evolution of phytotoxicity and water-soluble phenol content. Overall, under the conditions applied, data suggest a marginal influence of the inoculated starters on the physical, chemical and microbiological properties of compost piles, with the resident microbiota playing a major role."

The PoOLV1- and PoOLV3-associated RNAs (ARNA1 and ARNA3) were 639 and 514 nt in length, and possessed one and two small ORFs, respectively. In the field isolates of P. oryzae, PoOLVs and ARNAs were detectable at varying levels, and the levels of PoOLV1 and ARNA1 as well as those of PoOLV3 and ARNA3, were tightly correlated. In addition, gene silencing of PoOLV1 and PoOLV3 resulted in a reduction of ARNA1 and ARNA3, respectively. There results indicated that replication of ARNA1 and ARNA3 was associated with PoOLV1 and PoOLV3, respectively."

"31358515","abstracttext","Semidwarf stature is a valuable agronomic trait in grain crops that reduces lodging and increases harvest index. A fundamental advance during the 1960s Green Revolution was the introduction of semidwarf cultivars of rice and wheat. Essentially, all semidwarf varieties of rice under cultivation today owe their diminished stature to a specific null mutation in the gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis gene, SD1 However, it is now well-established that, in addition to GAs, brassinosteroids and strigolactones also control plant height. In this review, we describe the synthesis and signaling pathways of these three hormones as understood in rice and discuss the mutants and transgenics in these pathways that confer semidwarfism and other valuable architectural traits. We propose that such genes offer underexploited opportunities for broadening the genetic basis and germplasm in semidwarf rice breeding."

"31553484","abstracttext","The aldol reaction is one of the most fundamental stereocontrolled carbon-carbon bond-forming reactions and is mainly catalyzed by aldolases in nature. Despite the fact that the aldol reaction has been widely proposed to be involved in fungal secondary metabolite biosynthesis, a dedicated aldolase that catalyzes stereoselective aldol reactions has only rarely been reported in fungi. Herein, we activated a cryptic polyketide biosynthetic gene cluster that was upregulated in the fungal wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum during plant infection; this resulted in the production of the phytotoxic stemphyloxin II (1). Through heterologous reconstruction of the biosynthetic pathway and in vitro assay by using cell-free lysate from Aspergillus nidulans, we demonstrated that a berberine bridge enzyme (BBE)-like protein SthB catalyzes an intramolecular aldol reaction to establish the bridged tricyclo[6.2.2.0 2,7 ]dodecane skeleton in the post-assembly tailoring step. The characterization of SthB as an aldolase enriches the catalytic toolbox of classic reactions and the functional diversities of the BBE superfamily of enzymes."

Overexpression of WZY3-1 in E.coli enhanced their tolerance to mannitol and NaCl. WZY3-1 protein could protect lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) under freeze and heat stress. Overexpression of WZY3-1 showed that WZY3-1 could help to improve the drought tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis . In summary, our works show that WZY3-1 plays an important role in abiotic stress resistance in prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms."

"31697495","abstracttext","The major components of wheat storage proteins are gliadins and glutenins, and as they contribute differently to baking quality, a balanced mixture of these components is essential. The application of foliar nitrogen (N) at anthesis is a common practice to improve protein concentration and composition. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a foliar N application at anthesis on storage protein gene expression during grain development and on the distribution of protein concentration and protein body size within the grain. In this experiment, an additional N application at anthesis stimulated the expression of genes of the majority of storage proteins when the N supply was low. Furthermore, it led to higher protein concentrations in the subaleurone layers, while in the center of the lobes, the protein concentrations were decreased. These changes will affect the protein recovery in white flours, as proportionally more protein might be lost during milling processes."

"31698543","abstracttext","The economically important necrotrophic fungal pathogen, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), causes tan spot of wheat, a disease typified by foliar necrosis and chlorosis. The culture filtrate of an Australian Ptr isolate, M4, possesses phytotoxic activity and plant bioassay guided discovery led to the purification of necrosis inducing toxins called triticone A and B. High-resolution LC-MS/MS analysis of the culture filtrate identified an additional 37 triticone-like compounds. The biosynthetic gene cluster responsible for triticone production (the Ttc cluster) was identified and deletion of TtcA, a hybrid polyketide synthase (PKS)-nonribosomal peptide synthase (NRPS), abolished production of all triticones. The pathogenicity of mutant (ttcA) strains was not visibly affected in our assays. We hypothesize that triticones possess general antimicrobial activity important for competition in multi-microbial environments."

"33015458","abstracttext","Plant genetic engineering offers promising solutions to the increasing demand for efficient, sustainable, and high-yielding crop production as well as changing environmental conditions. The main challenge for gene delivery in plants is the presence of a cell wall that limits the transportation of genes within the cells. Microspores are plant cells that are, under the right conditions, capable of generating embryos, leading to the formation of haploid plants. Here, we designed cationic and fluorescent rosette nanotubes (RNTs) that penetrate the cell walls of viable wheat microspores under mild conditions and in the absence of an external force. These nanomaterials can capture plasmid DNA to form RNT-DNA complexes and transport their DNA cargo into live microspores. The nanomaterials and the complexes formed were nontoxic to the microspores."

"33017145","abstracttext","We here designed an in vitro selection scheme for obtaining an aptamer with which to rationally construct an artificial riboswitch as its component part. In fact, a nanosized DNA-binding aptamer obtained through this scheme allowed us to easily and successfully create eukaryotic riboswitches that upregulate internal ribosome entry site-mediated translation in response to the ligand (nanosized DNA) in wheat germ extract, a eukaryotic cell-free expression system. The induction ratio of the best riboswitch ligand-dose-dependently increased to 21 at 300 μM ligand. This switching efficiency is much higher than that of the same type of riboswitch with a widely used theophylline-binding aptamer, which was in vitro selected without considering its utility for constructing riboswitches. The selection scheme described here would facilitate obtaining various ligand/aptamer pairs suitable for constructing artificial riboswitches, which could serve as elements of synthetic gene circuits in synthetic biology."

"32933546","abstracttext","Chitinase and chitin-oligosaccaride can be used in multiple field, so it is important to develop a high-yield chitinase producing strain. Here, a recombinant Pichia pastoris with 4 copies of ChiA gene from Bacillus licheniformis and co-expression of molecular chaperon HAC1 was constructed. The amount of recombinant ChiA in the supernatant of high-cell-density fermentation reaches a maximum of 12.7 mg/mL, which is 24-fold higher than that reported in the previous study. The recombinant ChiA can hydrolyze 30% collodidal chitin with 74% conversion ratio, and GlcNAc is the most abundant hydrolysis product, followed by N, N'-diacetylchitobiose. Combined with BsNagZ, the hydrolysate of ChiA can be further transformed into GlcNAc with 88% conversion ratio. Additionally, the hydrolysate of ChiA can obviously accelerate the germination growth of rice and wheat, increasing the seedling height and root length by at least 1.6 folds within 10 days."

"32712756","abstracttext","In this study, rumen content was used to obtain three enrichments of anaerobic fungi and methanogens (F + M enrichment), bacteria and methanogens (B + M enrichment), and whole rumen content (WRC enrichment), to evaluate their respective ability to degrade lignocellulose and produce methane. Among the treatments, F + M enrichment elicited the strongest lignocellulose degradation and methane production ability with both rice straw and wheat straw as substrates. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis and diversity analyses of methanogens in the three enrichment treatments demonstrated that F + M had larger number of 16S rRNA gene copies of methanogens and higher relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter, the predominant methanogen found in all enrichments. Caecomyces was the main anaerobic fungal genus for co-culturing to provide substrates for methanogens in this enrichment. Importantly, the F + M enrichment was stable and could be maintained with transfers supplied every 3 days, confirming its potential utility in anaerobic digestion for lignocellulose degradation and methane production."

"33176219","abstracttext","Phosphatidylserine decarboxylases (Psds) are enzymes regulating phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, and have the central role in lipid metabolism. To date, the functions of Psds in plant pathogenic fungi are not fully understood. In this study, we have characterized two yeast Psd orthologues: FgPsd1 and FgPsd2, in Fusarium graminearum. Our results indicate that FgPsd1 and FgPsd2 are localized in mitochondria and Golgi, respectively. In addition, we have determined that FgPsd1 is a lethal gene and deletion of FgPsd2 resulted in a significant reduction of mycelial growth and conidiation. Futhermore, the FgPsd2 deletion mutant (ΔFgPsd2) is defective in ascospore production and virulence in wheat. Our study has also found that the ΔFgPsd2 mutant is more sensitive to osmotic and oxygen stresses. Moreover, deletion of FgPsd2 reduced the formation of lipid droplets and aggravated autophagy in F. graminearum. In summary, our findings indicate that FgPsd2 is important for mycelial growth, sexual and asexual reproduction, virulence, lipid droplet formation and autophagy in F. graminearum."

"10902715","abstracttext","A nuclear gene, Ncc-tmp1A, of Triticum timopheevii is required for the nucleus-cytoplasm (NC) compatibility in tetraploid NC hybrids with the cytoplasm of Aegilops squarrosa. A euploid NC hybrid of T. durum was previously produced by introgressing the gene from chromosome 1A of T. timopheevii. To examine the possible presence of a functional homoeoallele in the G genome of T. timopheevii, segregation of seed viability was studied as a marker phenotype in BC1s involving the two types of NC hybrids, (Ae. squarrosa)-T. timopheevii and (Ae. squarrosa)-T. turgidum. The result of these test crosses suggested that the G genome possesses a functional homoeoallele Ncc-tmp1G. Segregation of two RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) markers that were closely linked to Ncc-tmp1A was further studied among the viable BC1s obtained from a test cross of (Ae. squarrosa)-T. timopheevii x T. turgidum. Some viable BC1 segregants without the markers were obtained, suggesting a limited degree of transmission of chromosome 1G carrying Ncc-tmp1G. However, a similar RAPD analysis of BC1s obtained after backcrosses of reciprocal F1s of T. timopheevii/T. turgidum with T. turgidum showed random marker segregation. Thus, it was concluded that Ncc-tmp1A is not required for compatibility with its own cytoplasm. Southern blot analysis of the euploid NC hybrid using RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism) markers on the homologous group 1 chromosomes showed that Ncc-tmp1A locates in the centromeric region."

"20145294","abstracttext","Employing FISH analysis as well as BLAST and CUSTAL W (1.82) programs, we investigated types of DNA nucleotide sequences building an additional heterochromatic band in 2R chromosomes of 3 lines of Secale vavilovii Grossh. The probes used in FISH analysis were designed based on the reverse transcriptase sequence of Ty1-copia and Ty3-gypsy retrotransposons and the 5S rRNA gene sequence. No hybridization signals from the reverse transcriptase probes were observed in the chromosome region where the additional band occurs. On the other hand, signals were observed after hybridization with the 5S rDNA probe, clearly suggesting the presence of that type of sequences in the analyzed heterochromatin band. Using BLAST and CUSTAL W programs, we revealed high similarity of the JNK1 sequence to the 5S rRNA gene from Hordeum chilense (HCH1016, HCH1018, 88%) and to a fragment of the 5S rRNA sequence of H. marinum (HMAR003, 97%). In addition, the same fragment of JNK1 was shown to be very similar to the part of the Angela retrotransposon (92%) as well as to the SNAC 426K20-1 transposon (89%) belonging to CACTA family, both from Triticum monococcum, and to Zingeria biebersteiniana pericentromeric sequences (78%). The similarity of JNK1 to those sequences may be accidental or the JNK1 may represent an ancient mobile genetic element that caught the 5S rRNA sequence. During the evolution those sequences might have been accumulated in the particular region on the 2R chromosome. Our results suggest that the additional heterochromatin band in chromosomes 2R of S. vavilovii is a collection of defective genes and/or mobile genetic elements."

"21073590","articletitle","Nonadditive changes to cytosine methylation as a consequence of hybridization and genome duplication in Senecio (Asteraceae)."
"21073590","abstracttext","The merger of two or more divergent genomes within an allopolyploid nucleus can facilitate speciation and adaptive evolution in flowering plants. Widespread changes to gene expression have been shown to result from interspecific hybridisation and polyploidy in a number of plant species, and attention has now shifted to determining the epigenetic processes that drive these changes. We present here an analysis of cytosine methylation patterns in triploid F(1) Senecio (ragwort) hybrids and their allohexaploid derivatives. We observe that, in common with similar studies in Arabidopsis, Spartina and Triticum, a small but significant proportion of loci display nonadditive methylation in the hybrids, largely resulting from interspecific hybridisation. Despite this, genome duplication results in a secondary effect on methylation, with reversion to additivity at some loci and novel methylation status at others. We also observe differences in methylation state between different allopolyploid generations, predominantly in cases of additive methylation with regard to which parental methylation state is dominant. These changes to methylation state in both F(1) triploids and their allohexaploid derivatives largely mirror the overall patterns of nonadditive gene expression observed in our previous microarray analyses and may play a causative role in generating those expression changes. These similar global changes to DNA methylation resulting from hybridisation and genome duplication may serve as a source of epigenetic variation in natural populations, facilitating adaptive evolution. Our observations that methylation state can also vary between different generations of polyploid hybrids suggests that newly formed allopolyploid species may display a high degree of epigenetic diversity upon which natural selection can act."

"23789993","abstracttext","We have investigated the complex relationships among the annual genera within the tribe Triticeae through phylogenetic analyses of the 5S rRNA multigene family. Cloned sequences were assigned to groups of orthologous sequences, called unit classes, that were subjected to several analyses including BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) searches to assess possible ancestral relationships with perennial genera; phylogenetic analyses using parsimony (Pars), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian methods; and minimum reticulation networks from the Pars, ML, and Bayesian trees. In this study, we included genera with both annual and perennial species, such as Dasypyrum, Hordeum, and Secale. BLAST pointed to Pseudoroegneria (carrier of the St genome) and possibly Thinopyrum (carrier of the J genome) as the potential next of kin. However, Thinopyrum and Pseudoroegneria have never fallen together on the individual trees with the former generally associated with Crithopsis, Aegilops, Triticum, and Dasypyrum, while the latter is usually associated with the rest of the genera within Triticeae. The ""long"" unit classes placed Dasypyrum breviaristatum together with Dasypyrum villosum, whereas the ""short"" unit classes put them far apart on the trees. None of the gene trees alone was able to summarize the complex relationships among the genera, in line with previous results in the Triticeae. However, the application of tools designed to display phylogenetic networks was able to depict the complex links among the genera based on the short and the long gene trees, including the close link between Thinopyrum and Pseudoroegneria suggested by the phylogenetic analyses. In addition, our analyses provide support for the hypothesis that at least some annual Triticeae taxa are derived from their perennial relatives."
"25907026","articletitle","The effects of recombination, mutation and selection on the evolution of the Rp1 resistance genes in grasses."
"25907026","abstracttext","Plant immune genes, or resistance genes, are involved in a co-evolutionary arms race with a diverse range of pathogens. In agronomically important grasses, such R genes have been extensively studied because of their role in pathogen resistance and in the breeding of resistant cultivars. In this study, we evaluate the importance of recombination, mutation and selection on the evolution of the R gene complex Rp1 of Sorghum, Triticum, Brachypodium, Oryza and Zea. Analyses show that recombination is widespread, and we detected 73 independent instances of sequence exchange, involving on average 1567 of 4692 nucleotides analysed (33.4%). We were able to date 24 interspecific recombination events and found that four occurred postspeciation, which suggests that genetic introgression took place between different grass species. Other interspecific events seemed to have been maintained over long evolutionary time, suggesting the presence of balancing selection. Significant positive selection (i.e. a relative excess of nonsynonymous substitutions (dN /dS >1)) was detected in 17-95 codons (0.42-2.02%). Recombination was significantly associated with areas with high levels of polymorphism but not with an elevated dN /dS ratio. Finally, phylogenetic analyses show that recombination results in a general overestimation of the divergence time (mean = 14.3%) and an alteration of the gene tree topology if the tree is not calibrated. Given that the statistical power to detect recombination is determined by the level of polymorphism of the amplicon as well as the number of sequences analysed, it is likely that many studies have underestimated the importance of recombination relative to the mutation rate."
"26837272","articletitle","Genetic architecture of adaptation to novel environmental conditions in a predominantly selfing allopolyploid plant."
"26837272","abstracttext","Genetic architecture of adaptation is traditionally studied in the context of local adaptation, viz. spatially varying conditions experienced by the species. However, anthropogenic changes in the natural environment pose a new context to this issue, that is, adaptation to an environment that is new for the species. In this study, we used crossbreeding to analyze genetic architecture of adaptation to conditions not currently experienced by the species but with high probability of encounter in the near future due to global climate change. We performed targeted interpopulation crossing using genotypes from two core and two peripheral Triticum dicoccoides populations and raised the parents and three generations of hybrids in a greenhouse under simulated desert conditions to analyze the genetic architecture of adaptation to these conditions and an effect of gene flow from plants having different origin. The hybrid (F1) fitness did not differ from that of the parents in crosses where both plants originated from the species core, but in crosses involving one parent from the species core and another one from the species periphery the fitness of F1 was consistently higher than that of the periphery-originated parent. Plant fitness in the next two generations (F2 and F3) did not differ from the F1, suggesting that effects of epistatic interactions between recombining and segregating alleles of genes contributing to fitness were minor or absent. The observed low importance of epistatic gene interactions in allopolyploid T. dicoccoides and low probability of hybrid breakdown appear to be the result of permanent fixation of heterozygosity and lack of intergenomic recombination in this species. At the same time, predominant but not complete selfing combined with an advantage of bivalent pairing of homologous chromosomes appears to maintain high genetic variability in T. dicoccoides, greatly enhancing its adaptive ability."

"29926196","abstracttext","HKT transporters which mediate Na + -specific transport or Na + -K + co-transport, play an important role in protecting plants from salinity stress by preventing Na + -over-accumulation in leaves. In this work, a 1508-bp genomic fragment upstream of the TmHKT1;4-A1 translated sequence from Triticum monococcum has been isolated, cloned, and designated as the ''PrTmHKT1;4-A1'' promoter. Sequence analysis of ''PrTmHKT1;4-A1'' revealed the presence of cis-regulatory elements which could be required for abiotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA) responsiveness. The PrTmHKT1;4-A1 sequence was fused to the β-glucuronidase gene and the resulting construct was transferred into Arabidopsis plants. Histochemical assays of stably transformed Arabidopsis plants showed that PrTmHKT1;4-A1 is active in this heterologous system. Under control conditions, GUS histochemical staining was observed significantly only in leaves of 20-day-old plants. Histological sections prepared at this stage and in leaves revealed activity localized in leaf veins (phloem and bundle sheath). In flowers, GUS activity was detected only in sepals. After 3 days of challenging the plants with salt, dehydration or ABA treatments, the PrTmHKT1;4-A1 transformed Arabidopsis plants showed a substantial increase in the GUS staining in leaves, compared to untransformed plants under the same conditions. Real time qPCR expression analysis of the uidA gene, showed that GusA transcripts were up-regulated by salt, dehydration, and ABA treatments. All together, these results showed that PrTmHKT1;4-A1 is an age-dependent, abiotic-stress-inducible, organ-specific and tissue-specific promoter in a heterologous dicot system."

Research in skin care and dermatology is constantly looking for new non-invasive solutions, preferably those based on the use of natural certified products, able to accelerate the spontaneous skin repair mechanisms and without altering the skin normal appearance and functionality. The wound healing process in the skin is finely regulated by several factors and orchestrated mechanisms, which modulate the progression and the fitting of different consequent phases, including haemostasis, inflammation, cell proliferation and tissue remodelling.

"1125978","abstracttext","Sixteen virus-specific polypeptides have been resolved in reovirus-infected mouse L cells by using SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. Of these, ten have been designated as primary products of the genome by the following criteria: they are present in lysates of infected cells labeled for a short time; they co-migrate on SDS-polyacrylamide slab gels with polypeptides synthesized in cell-free-extracts of wheat germ in response to purified viral mRNA; and their molecular weights correspond to the values expected if all ten reovirus mRNA species are monocistronic. Reovirus mRNA species lack 3' poly(A) but are translated into proteins of the expected size. The pattern of synthesis of the primary gene products observed in vitro mimicks that observed in reovirus-infected cells suggesting that the structure of the mRNA may profoundly influence its translation. The results further indicate that there is little, if any, exclusively regulatory information in the reovirus genome since both in vivo and in vitro, transcripts of the ten genome segments direct the synthesis of ten polypeptides that presumably correspond to the primary gene products. The expression of the reovirus genome thus appears to be complete."

"2493582","abstracttext","Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is caused by a defective gene found on the X-chromosome. Dystrophin is encoded by the DMD gene and represents about 0.002% of total muscle protein. Immunochemical studies have shown that dystrophin is localized to the sarcolemma in normal muscle but is absent in muscle from DMD patients. Many features of the predicted primary structure of dystrophin are shared with membrane cytoskeletal proteins, but the precise function of dystrophin in muscle is unknown. Here we report the first isolation of dystrophin from digitonin-solubilized skeletal muscle membranes using wheat germ agglutinin (WGA)-Sepharose. We find that dystrophin is not a glycoprotein but binds to WGA-Sepharose because of its tight association with a WGA-binding glycoprotein. The association of dystrophin with this glycoprotein is disrupted by agents that dissociate cytoskeletal proteins from membranes. We conclude that dystrophin is linked to an integral membrane glycoprotein in the sarcolemma. Our results indicate that the function of dystrophin could be to link this glycoprotein to the underlying cytoskeleton and thus help either to preserve membrane stability or to keep the glycoprotein non-uniformly distributed in the sarcolemma."

"2145628","abstracttext","The mechanism by which phytohormones, like abscisic acid (ABA), regulate gene expression is unknown. An activity in nuclear extracts that interacts with the ABA response element (ABRE) from the 5' regulatory region of the wheat Em gene was identified. A complementary DNA clone was isolated whose product is a DNA binding protein (EmBP-1) that interacts specifically with an 8-base pair (bp) sequence (CACGTGGC) in the ABRE. A 2-bp mutation in this sequence prevented binding of EmBP-1. The same mutation reduced the ability of the ABRE to confer ABA responsiveness on a viral promoter in a transient assay. The 8-bp EmBP-1 target sequence was found to be conserved in several other ABA-responsive promoters and in promoters from plants that respond to signals other than ABA. Similar sequences are found in promoters from mammals, yeast, and in the major late promoter of adenovirus. The deduced amino acid sequence of EmBP-1 contains conserved basic and leucine zipper domains found in transcription factors in plants, yeast, and mammals. EmBP-1 may be a member of a highly conserved family of proteins that recognize a core sequence found in the regulatory regions of various genes that are integrated into a number of different response pathways."
"2090425","articletitle","Variation and inheritance of cytosine methylation patterns in wheat at the high molecular weight glutenin and ribosomal RNA gene loci."
"2090425","abstracttext","Chromosome marking by cytosine methylation has been examined in two gene systems in wheat--at the loci encoding high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits (seed proteins) and ribosomal RNA. Variation in cytosine methylation occurs between progeny in highly inbred lines around the HMW glutenin locus. The variation is inherited through meiosis to F1 and F2 generations but occasionally a new variant arises. Specific cytosine residues lose their methyl group in the seed, the organ where the genes are expressed. Within the multigene family of ribosomal RNA genes, several subsets of genes can be defined based upon the cytosine methylation patterns. High activity of a ribosomal RNA gene locus is correlated with loss of methylation at specific cytosine residues, especially in the promoter and upstream regulatory regions. A model is described in which the subset of genes selected to be used are those to which specific regulatory proteins and transcription complexes bind most favourably. Binding of such proteins inhibits cytosine methylation and so marks the subset of genes for expression in subsequent cell generations. Examples are described where new types of RNA genes are introduced via sexual crosses that result in changes to the methylation patterns of the ribosomal RNA genes. The processes determining the changes begin, it is believed, in the fertilised egg."

"1370465","abstracttext","The response of endothelial cells to the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) is complex, involving the induction and suppression of multiple genes and gene products. Differential screening of a TNF-stimulated, cycloheximide-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cell library has resulted in the cloning of several novel cDNAs whose protein products are involved in the primary response of the endothelium to TNF. One of these cDNAs, designated B12, is further characterized here. B12 is encoded by a 3.5-kilobase transcript and is induced rapidly and transiently by TNF. Transcript expression is found to be developmentally regulated in a tissue-specific manner, with B12 message being differentially expressed in the heart and liver during mouse embryogenesis. The open reading frame of B12 predicts a 316-amino acid sequence rich in charged residues, particularly at the carboxyl terminus, and has neither significant homology to other known proteins nor to any extent sequence motifs. B12 is found to be a highly conserved single-copy gene which is located in the q22----q23 region of human chromosome 17. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a large portion of the B12 open reading frame immunoprecipitate a 36-kilodalton polypeptide from wheat germ lysates programmed to translate in vitro transcribed B12 mRNA. The B12 protein is further shown to be induced in human umbilical vein endothelial cells by TNF, and the protein is shown to be rapidly degraded."

"1495483","abstracttext","We isolated, and expressed in Escherichia coli, a gene (Wcs120) that is strongly induced during cold acclimation of wheat. The gene product was purified and used to produce antibodies. Immunoblotting experiments with the anti-WCS120 antibody identified several cold-induced proteins named FTMs for Freezing Tolerance Markers since they are associated with the development of freezing tolerance. This protein family was found to be coordinately regulated specifically by low temperature, highly hydrophilic, stable to boiling, and to have a pI above 6.5. The accumulation kinetics during the acclimation period indicated a positive correlation with the capacity of each genotype to develop freezing tolerance. Accumulation of the proteins was higher in the freezing-tolerant genotype than in the less tolerant one. In addition, their accumulation was more pronounced in the crown and leaf tissues compared with roots, confirming a relationship to the capacity of the different tissues to develop freezing tolerance. Analysis of different species (eight monocots and four dicots) indicated that this protein family is specific for freezing-tolerant cereals. The antibody did not cross-react with any of the non-cereal species examined. The anti-FTMs antibody represents a potential tool for breeders to select for freezing tolerance traits in the Gramineae."

The phage library was screened with a 5'-labelled synthetic oligonucleotide complementary to nucleotides 18 to 37 of cytoplasmic tobacco tRNA(Tyr). Eleven hybridizing Eco RI fragments ranging in size from 1.7 to 7.5 kb were isolated from recombinant lambda phage and subcloned into pUC19 plasmid. Four of the sequenced tRNA(Tyr) genes code for the known tobacco tRNA1(Tyr) (G psi A) and seven code for tRNA2(Tyr) (G psi A). The two tRNA species differ in one nucleotide pair at the basis of the T psi C stem. Only one tRNA(Tyr) gene (pNtY5) contains a point mutation (T54-->A54). Comparison of the intervening sequences reveals that they differ considerably in length and sequence. Maturation of intron-containing pre-tRNAs was studied in HeLa and wheat germ extracts. All pre-tRNAs(Tyr)--with one exception--are processed and spliced in both extracts. The tRNA(Tyr) gene encoded by pNtY5 is transcribed efficiently in HeLa extract but processing of the pre-tRNA is impaired."

(1973) Plant Physiol. 51, 448-453]. A cDNA clone which presumably encodes the C3-form isozyme was newly isolated and analyzed. Comparison of the sequences of the C3-form and C4-form isozymes revealed that (i) the homologies in the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were 71 and 77%, respectively, and (ii) the gene for the C4-form isozyme evolved under strong G/C pressure. The genes for these isozymes were found to be located apart on different chromosomes. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using 8 amino acid sequences of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases from various sources. The topology of the tree indicated that, at least in monocots such as maize and sorghum, the genes for the C4-form and C3-form isozymes diverged from their common ancestral gene earlier than the monocot-dicot divergence (about 2 x 10(8) yr ago), though the divergence of maize (C4 plant) from wheat (C3 plant) is supposed to have occurred much later (6 x 10(7) yr ago)."
"267932","articletitle","Regulation by estrogen of the vitellogenin gene."
"267932","abstracttext","The vitellogenin gene is inactive in the liver of male Xenopus laevis, unless exogenous estrogen is administered. We have previously shown that conventional doses of estradiol-17beta result in the appearance of new hepatic messenger RNAs, some of which are encoded for vitellogenin. We now report that much higher doses of the hormone (2 mg/frog per day for 4 days) are required to elicit maximal responses. The relative levels of membrane-bound polysomes and vitellogenin mRNA were determined as a function of time and dose of hormone. Translation of total polysomal RNA in a cell-free system derived from wheat germ was used to estimate the relative levels of vitellogenin messenger RNA. Faithful translation of this messenger RNA was indicated by two lines of evidence: labeled cell-free products were immunoprecipitated with antivitellogenin antibody, and the migration of the major labeled product in sodium dodecyl sulfate/acrylamide gels was identical to that of native vitellogenin. Our results establish conditions for maximal estrogen-induced responses in this system, and are compatible with the hypothesis that a major regulatory mechanism of steroid hormones in the control of protein synthesis is that of gene activation and regulation of messenger RNA levels."
"3208752","articletitle","Wheat germ splicing endonuclease is highly specific for plant pre-tRNAs."
"3208752","abstracttext","Intron-containing pre-tRNAs from organisms as different as yeast, Nicotiana, Xenopus and man are efficiently spliced and processed in a HeLa cell extract. They are also correctly processed in a wheat germ extract; however, the intron is removed only from the tobacco pre-tRNA. To determine whether plant pre-tRNA introns have any specific structural and/or sequence feature we have cloned two intron-containing tRNATyr genes from the plant Arabidopsis. Comparison of these genes, of the Nicotiana tRNATyr gene and of a Glycine max tRNAMet gene reveals that plant introns from three different species have no sequence homology and are only 11 to 13 nucleotides long. Thus, short length may be one important feature of plant introns. Furthermore, the 5' and 3' splice sites are separated by 4 bp in the extended anticodon stems of these pre-tRNA structures. In contrast, yeast and vertebrate introns are rather variable in length and the splice sites are separated by 5 or 6 bp. These differences in distance and relative helical orientation of the splice sites in plant pre-tRNAs versus pre-tRNAs from other organisms are obviously tolerated by the vertebrate splicing endonuclease, but not at all by the plant enzyme."

"3575095","abstracttext","A 67-nucleotide portion of the non-coding, 5'-leader sequence of tobacco mosaic virus RNA [defined as omega' (Gr. omega prime)] has been shown to enhance the translation of contiguous foreign gene transcripts both in vitro and in vivo. Chemically-synthesized omega', containing convenient linker sequences, was inserted into derivatives of an in vitro transcription plasmid (pSP64) between the bacteriophage-SP6 promoter and sequences coding for either chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) or neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII). Run-off in vitro transcripts, with or without a 5'-cap structure (G(5')ppp(5')G) and/or the omega' sequence, were tested in mRNA-dependent cell-free translation systems derived from rabbit reticulocyte lysate, wheat germ extract or Escherichia coli (MRE 600). In all cases, the presence of omega' increased the translational expression of both reporter genes, typically between 2- to 10-fold. Electroporation of isolated mesophyll protoplasts from Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi, or microinjection of oocytes from Xenopus laevis, with SP6-transcripts containing the CAT-coding region confirmed and extended the value of omega' as a potential translational enhancer of gene expression in vivo."

"1840685","abstracttext","AT-rich sequences in the 5' flanking regions of several plant genes have been shown to bind nuclear proteins, but the nature of these proteins has remained largely unknown. We report here that certain plant high mobility group (HMG) chromosomal proteins can interact specifically (in the presence of excess non-specific competitor) with AT-rich sequences located upstream of the pea ferredoxin 1 gene (Fed-1) and a member of the wheat Em gene family. Binding was observed with highly purified preparations of HMGa or HMGb, but not with HMGc or HMGd. HMG-DNA complexes were similar to one of the two types of Fed-1 complexes we observed previously using pea nuclear extracts [7]. HMG binding to the Fed-1 DNA was localized to a region containing AT-rich sequences; very similar sequences are present 5' to Em and several other plants genes. Such sequences have been shown to bind unidentified nuclear proteins in a number of these systems. Binding experiments with a synthetic oligo (dA).oligo (dT) probe and competition experiments with synthetic DNA polymers suggest that HMG binding may depend upon structural features of AT-rich DNA rather than being sequence-specific. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest a role for HMG binding which is consistent with previous evidence linking HMGs with transcriptionally competent chromatin."

"1740163","abstracttext","A plumage color mutant, dotted white (DTW), of Japanese quail is described in this paper. The adult DTW mutant shows white plumage with a small colored spot on the head and/or back. The pigmented spots invariably appear on the dorsal region and never on the ventral region of the body. Some birds lack colored spots and show pure white plumage. The chick of the DTW mutant shows cream yellow plumules similar to those of the White Leghorn chick. Colored spots also exist as in adults, and its coloration is diluted light brown. The feathers on colored spots of the adult show diluted pigmentation as compared with wild-type feathers. In addition, the wheat-straw colored shaft streak is extremely narrow and the transversal bars are missing. The DTW mutant is thought to be genetically different from previously reported similar mutants, brown-splashed white, panda, and recessive white. Genetic analyses revealed that the DTW mutant plumage is controlled by an autosomal recessive gene. The gene symbol dtw is provisionally proposed, since there remains a possibility that the DTW character may be allelic to some of the similar mutant characters mentioned above."

"1806042","abstracttext","We report the complete sequence of one functional member of the Em gene family whose expression in wheat embryos is regulated by a complex set of environmental and developmental controls, including the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). The Em coding region contains one short intron, and there is an inverted repeat in the transcribed 3'-flanking region. A 646 bp fragment from the 5' promoter, which was previously shown to direct ABA-regulated expression in transformed tobacco tissue and rice cells, is characterized by: (1) three stretches of between 33 and 73 nucleotides of A/T rich (greater than 86%) boxes, (2) one copy of an eight bp palindrome (CATGCATG) which is identical to the RY repeat found in the 5' promoters of many legume genes expressed during embryo development, (3) 15 copies of a six bp repeat (PuCACGPy), found primarily in the 5' region, and (4) two sequences in the ABA-response region, CGAGCAG and a CACGT motif, both of which are conserved in 5' non-coding regions of other plant genes that are expressed in response to ABA and/or in embryos. These sequence comparisons are discussed in relation to the regulation of Em gene expression and other ABA-regulated genes."

"6951159","abstracttext","The biosynthesis of the protein precursor of [Met]enkephalin (Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-Met) was studied using cell-free translation systems to characterize the enkephalin-precursor gene product and mRNA. Proteins obtained by translation of bovine adrenal medullary mRNA in the presence of [35S]methionine were digested with trypsin and carboxypeptidase B. The resultant peptides were immunoprecipitated with anti[Met]enkephalin serum and subsequently analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. [35S][Met]Enkephalin (up to 0.2 fmol/micrograms mRNA, identified by antigenic specificity and chromatographic mobility, was isolated from peptides obtained from proteins whose synthesis was dependent upon adrenal medullary mRNA. Both trypsin and carboxy-peptidase B were required to generate [35S][Met]enkephalin from translation products. The largest protein containing the [35S]-[Met]enkephalin sequence synthesized in the wheat germ system has a Mr, of 31,000 +/- 1000, determined by NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Adrenal medullary mRNA coding for protein containing the [35S][Met]enkephalin sequence was resolved into a major fraction of 1450 +/- 150 nucleotides and a minor fraction of 47000 +/- 450 nucleotides, as determined by agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of methylmercuric hydroxide. It is proposed that the major enkephalin-precursor gene product of adrenal medulla is a protein of Mr approximately 31,000.U"

"6361032","abstracttext","Rates of synthesis of albumin and transferrin were compared with the levels of their cognate mRNAs in primary monolayer cultures of chick embryo hepatocytes over a period of 72 h. These liver cells were exposed, from the onset of culture, only to a chemically defined medium devoid of hormonal or macromolecular supplement. Synthesis of transferrin was constant whereas synthesis of albumin diminished to near 0 in 3 days. RNA prepared from hepatocyte monolayers, maintained for various lengths of time in culture, was translated in wheat germ extracts and Xenopus oocytes. Translation products were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In addition, total RNA from the cultured cells was hybridized to labeled cDNA probes to determine the number of sequences specific for each protein. Albumin mRNA was found to decrease with time in culture in all three assay systems, while transferrin mRNA remained constant. Analysis of the kinetics suggests a selective decay, with a half-life of 7 h, of the amount of albumin-specific RNA present at the beginning of culture. Apparently, in the hormone-deprived hepatocytes, there is little or no further transcription of the albumin gene. After addition of insulin to the cultures, albumin mRNA levels increased, suggesting an effect of this hormone on albumin gene utilization."

"7647293","abstracttext","In order to study the regulation of nuclear genes coding for plastid ribosomal proteins, we have analysed the promoter region of spinach rps22 using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. By footprinting analyses, we have identified eight DNA elements interacting with spinach leaf nuclear factors in the 300 bp promoter region upstream of the transcription start site. Among these elements, four are short AT-rich sequences and one is identical to the Hex motif characterized initially in wheat histone genes. In transgenic tobacco plants, the reporter gene coding for the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) directed by a 1.2 kb upstream region of rps22 was expressed in several plant organs, with high levels in leaf mesophyll, embryo cotyledons and root meristematic cells and very low levels in other cell types. Interestingly, when deleted to -295, the promoter, which contained all the foot-printed elements, was still able to confer the same expression pattern, although the activity was relatively lower than with the 1.2 kb promoter. When deleted further to -154, the promoter, from which the AT-rich elements were eliminated, loses its activity almost completely, suggesting that these AT-rich elements are important for the rps22 promoter activity. Altogether, our results show that rps22 gene expression is controlled by specific cis elements not present in other nuclear-encoded plastid ribosomal protein genes studied so far."
"8431957","articletitle","RNA editing of a chimeric maize mitochondrial gene transcript is sequence specific."
"8431957","abstracttext","RNA editing was analysed in the mitochondrial ATPase complex subunit 6 gene (atp6) transcripts of the C male-sterile cytoplasm (cms-C) of maize. The only copy of atp6 in cms-C, designated C-atp6, is a triple gene fusion product comprised of DNA sequences derived from atp9, atp6, and an unknown origin. Sequences of cDNAs revealed 19 C to U alterations resulting in 16 amino acid residue changes compared to the genomic sequence. The only C to U edit in the 39-nucleotide sequence similar to atp9 was comparable to a change in the complete atp9 mRNAs of Petunia, Oenothera, wheat, and sorghum. The 442 nucleotides of unknown origin were not edited. The 18 editing events within the atp6 homologous region were similar to those in the atp6 transcripts of sorghum. RNA editing in maize C-atp6 transcripts introduces a translational stop codon at the same position where it is created by editing in sorghum and Oenothera atp6 mRNAs and is already present in atp6 open reading frames of most other plant and non-plant organisms. Our results, along with other reports on editing in chimeric transcripts, indicate that RNA editing is not influenced by rearrangements but instead is sequence specific."
"8437559","articletitle","Correlation between the size of the intergenic regulatory region, the status of cytosine methylation of rRNA genes and nucleolar expression in wheat."
"8437559","abstracttext","A large number of wheat rRNA genes are methylated at all the CCGG sites that are present in the intergenic regions. A smaller number of rRNA genes are not methylated at one or more CCGG sites. A subset of genes was found unmethylated at a specific CCGG site just downstream of the array of 135 bp A repeats in the intergenic region. In all the genotypes studied, the rDNA loci with larger intergenic regions between their genes also possess a greater number of rRNA genes that are unmethylated at one or more CCGG sites in the intergenic regions than do the loci with shorter intergenic regions. In four genotypes (for which data were available), rDNA loci with longer intergenic regions had larger secondary constrictions on metaphase chromosomes, a measure of relative locus activity, than the loci with shorter intergenic regions. The results have been integrated into a model for the control of rDNA expression based on correlations between cytosine methylation patterns and the number of upstream 135 bp repeats in intergenic regions. According to this model the 135 bp repeats play a part in the control of gene activity by binding a protein(s) that is in limiting supply, thereby predisposing the neighbouring gene to become active preferentially."

"8466755","abstracttext","The recently identified placenta growth factor gene (PIGF) code for a protein related to the vascular permeability factor (VPF). We present evidence indicating that expressing of this gene could be regulated at the post-transcriptional level. The region upstream to the coding region of PIGF mRNA contains a small open reading frame (ORF), potentially coding for a peptide of 15 amino acids. The translation of different constructs in reticulocyte and wheat germ lysates as well as in COS-1 and CV-1 cells indicates that this short region is a translational inhibitory element since mutations in its two potential initiator codons increase PIGF synthesis in vivo. Using RNAse protection assay, we demonstrate that the PIGF mRNAs obtained from human term placenta and JEG choriocarcinoma cell line have a complete 5' untranslated region and, consequently, also the above mentioned small ORF. Finally, the analysis of a bovine PIGF genomic clone reveals that this small ORF is strongly conserved with respect to both putative peptide sequences and distance from the PIGF coding region."

"8492808","abstracttext","An Arabidopsis homolog of the abscisic acid (ABA)-inducible cotton D19 and wheat Em genes was cloned and its expression assayed at two developmental stages in wild-type, ABA-deficient (aba) and three ABA-insensitive (abi) lines of Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of this gene was reduced slightly in seeds of aba mutants and approximately ten-fold in abi3 mutants, but seed expression was not decreased in either abi1 or abi2 monogenic mutants. In contrast, the abi1 and abi2 mutants showed a very slight reduction of ABA inducibility in 8-day-old plants, while the responses of aba and abi3 mutants were comparable to that of wild type. Although previous studies have shown that none of the abi mutations show completely stage-specific effects, the results reported here indicate that the importance of each of the ABI loci in regulating this single gene is stage-dependent. Furthermore, the fact that none of the abi mutations show more than minor effects on exogenous ABA inducibility of the Arabidopsis D19/Em homolog in young plants suggests that an additional ABA signalling pathway may be operating during vegetative growth."
"9024788","articletitle","Import of plasmid DNA into the nucleus is sequence specific."
"9024788","abstracttext","Nuclear import of plasmid DNA in nondividing cells is a process essential to the success of numerous viral life cycles, gene therapy protocols, and gene expression experiments. Here, intact protein-free SV40 DNA was cytoplasmically injected into cells and its subcellular localization was followed by in situ hybridization. SV40 DNA localized to the nucleus consistent with a mechanism of transport through the nuclear pore complex (NPC): import was inhibited by the addition of the NPC-inhibitory agents wheat germ agglutinin and an anti-nucleoporin antibody as well as by energy depletion. DNA transport appeared to be a multistep process with the DNA accumulating at the nuclear periphery before its import. Most importantly, nuclear import was sequence specific: a region of SV40 DNA containing the origin of replication and the early and late promoters supported import, whereas bacterial sequences alone and other SV40-derived sequences did not. The majority of the imported DNA colocalized with the SC-35 splicing complex antigen, suggesting that the intranuclear DNA localizes to areas of transcription or message processing. This link to transcription was strengthened by the finding that inhibition of transcription blocked DNA import but not protein nuclear import. Taken together, these results support a model in which plasmid DNA nuclear import occurs by a mechanism similar to that used by nuclear localization signal-containing proteins but is also dependent on transcription."

"8103614","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequence of the coat protein gene of cymbidium mosaic virus (CyMV) has been determined from a cDNA clone that encompassed the 3'-region of the virus genome. The 0.75 kb coat protein open reading frame (ORF) codes for a 24kD polypeptide. The coat protein coding region was separated from the 3'-poly(A) terminal of the viral genome by an 80 base noncoding region. The derived amino acid sequence of this ORF showed considerable homology with other potexvirus coat protein sequences, notably with narcissus mosaic virus (NMV), potato virus X (PVX), and white clover mosaic virus (WClMV). In vitro expression of the CyMV coat protein gene was carried out by T7 RNA polymerase on the linearized cDNA clone template, followed by in vitro translation of the purified transcript in wheat germ extract. One of the translated products was found to comigrate with the coat protein of the virus at about 24 kD, as determined by NaDodSO4-PAGE. This translated product was also found to crossreact with antibodies raised against CyMV."

The immunoresponse to the antibodies correlated with the enzymatic activity profile of the RdRP after chromatography on Q-, poly(A)-, and poly(U)-Sepharose, hydroxyapatite, and Sephadex G-200 columns. DNA gel blot analysis revealed a single copy of the RdRP gene in tomato. RdRP homologs from petunia, Arabidopsis, tobacco, and wheat were identified by using polymerase chain reaction. A sequence comparison indicated that sequences homologous to RdRP are also present in the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe and in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The previously described induction of RdRP activity upon viroid infection is shown to be correlated with an increased steady state level of the corresponding mRNA. The possible involvement of this heretofore functionally elusive plant RNA polymerase in homology-dependent gene silencing is discussed."

"10369673","abstracttext","Phytochelatins play major roles in metal detoxification in plants and fungi. However, genes encoding phytochelatin synthases have not yet been identified. By screening for plant genes mediating metal tolerance we identified a wheat cDNA, TaPCS1, whose expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae results in a dramatic increase in cadmium tolerance. TaPCS1 encodes a protein of approximately 55 kDa with no similarity to proteins of known function. We identified homologs of this new gene family from Arabidopsis thaliana, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and interestingly also Caenorhabditis elegans. The Arabidopsis and S.pombe genes were also demonstrated to confer substantial increases in metal tolerance in yeast. PCS-expressing cells accumulate more Cd2+ than controls. PCS expression mediates Cd2+ tolerance even in yeast mutants that are either deficient in vacuolar acidification or impaired in vacuolar biogenesis. PCS-induced metal resistance is lost upon exposure to an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis, a process necessary for phytochelatin formation. Schizosaccharomyces pombe cells disrupted in the PCS gene exhibit hypersensitivity to Cd2+ and Cu2+ and are unable to synthesize phytochelatins upon Cd2+ exposure as determined by HPLC analysis. Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells expressing PCS produce phytochelatins. Moreover, the recombinant purified S.pombe PCS protein displays phytochelatin synthase activity. These data demonstrate that PCS genes encode phytochelatin synthases and mediate metal detoxification in eukaryotes."

"10352448","abstracttext","The presence of a sensory component in the pharyngeal branch of the vagus nerve (PhB), including its peripheral distribution and central projection, was studied by denervation and tracer experiments in the cat. The distribution of nerve fibers immunoreactive to protein gene product 9.5, a sensitive neuronal marker; calcitonin gene-related peptide; and substance P in the pharyngeal epithelium was analyzed in both intact animals and animals subjected to partial denervation by means of sectioning two of the three nerve trunks, the glossopharyngeal nerve, the superior laryngeal nerve, and the PhB, while leaving one intact. The results of this study show that the glossopharyngeal nerve and superior laryngeal nerve carry nerve fibers to the pharyngeal epithelium rostral and caudal to the middle level of the epiglottis, respectively, whereas the PhB carries nerve fibers to the mesopharyngeal epithelium. Tracer experiments, by applying wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase to the PhB, demonstrated retrogradely labeled primary sensory neurons in the jugular ganglion and transganglionic labeling of terminals in the interstitial subnucleus of the nucleus of the tractus solitarius. These results indicate that the PhB contains a sensory component that originates from the jugular ganglion, innervates the mesopharyngeal epithelium, and projects to the nucleus of the tractus solitarius."

"8790284","abstracttext","The lifetime of the zein mRNA in a developing corn (Zea mays L.) kernel under genome transcription blockade with actinomycin D (in vivo) and in a cell-free system (in vitro) was studied. After a 10 h blockade of gene transcription with actinomycin D, only 55% of 19 kDa zein mRNA and 40% of 22 kDa mRNA were detected in a developing kernel of normal corn. In that of the opaque-2 mutant 80% of 19 kDa zein mRNA remained. To examine the relative stability of poly(A)-containing mRNA, cell-free systems from rabbit reticulocyte lysate and wheat-germ extract were used. In both cases only 40% of 19 kDa zein mRNA and 60% of 22 kDa zein mRNA decayed during a 30 min incubation. Differential mRNA degradation of poly(A)-containing zein mRNA was observed on affinity chromatography; poly(A)-containing 19 kDa zein mRNA from normal corn partially decayed by elution from poly(U)-Sepharose whereas that from opaque-2 remained stable. These data suggest that differential mRNA stability is an important factor in the regulation of the zein gene expression in a developing corn kernel."

"9452497","abstracttext","A wheat germ cell-free system was used to study details of ribosome shunting promoted by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S RNA leader. By testing a dicistronic construct with the leader placed between two coding regions, we confirmed that the 35 S RNA leader does not include an internal ribosome entry site of the type observed with picornavirus RNAs. A reporter gene fused to the leader was shown to be expressed by ribosomes that had followed the bypass route (shunted) and, with lower efficiency, by ribosomes that had scanned through the whole region. Stem section 1, the most stable of the three stem sections of the leader, was shown to be an important structural element for shunting. Mutations that abolished formation of this stem section drastically reduced reporter gene expression, whereas complementary mutations that restored stem section 1 also restored shunting. A micro-leader capable of shunting consisting of stem section 1 and flanking sequences could be defined. A small open reading frame preceding stem section 1 enhances shunting."

"9618537","abstracttext","A colonization mutant of the efficient root-colonizing biocontrol strain Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS365 is described that is impaired in competitive root-tip colonization of gnotobiotically grown potato, radish, wheat, and tomato, indicating a broad host range mutation. The colonization of the mutant is also impaired when studied in potting soil, suggesting that the defective gene also plays a role under more natural conditions. A DNA fragment that is able to complement the mutation for colonization revealed a multicistronic transcription unit composed of at least six ORFs with similarity to lppL, lysA, dapF, orf235/233, xerC/sss, and the largely incomplete orf238. The transposon insertion in PCL1233 appeared to be present in the orf235/233 homologue, designated orf240. Introduction of a mutation in the xerC/sss homologue revealed that the xerC/sss gene homologue rather than orf240 is crucial for colonization. xerC in Escherichia coli and sss in Pseudomonas aeruginosa encode proteins that belong to the lambda integrase family of site-specific recombinases, which play a role in phase variation caused by DNA rearrangements. The function of the xerC/sss homologue in colonization is discussed in terms of genetic rearrangements involved in the generation of different phenotypes, thereby allowing a bacterial population to occupy various habitats. Mutant PCL1233 is assumed to be locked in a phenotype that is not well suited to compete for colonization in the rhizosphere. Thus we show the importance of phase variation in microbe-plant interactions."

"9645425","abstracttext","Here we describe the structure and expression of the mitochondrial gene that encodes the S4 subunit of the mitochondrial ribosome (rps4) in two higher plants, rapeseed and rice. The ORFs of rapeseed and rice rps4 genes are 362 and 352 codons long, respectively, and their corresponding transcripts are edited (C-to-U conversions) in 19 and 15 positions, respectively. The amino acid sequences deduced from the sequences of the two rps4 genes are 78.1% identical to each other and show about 50% identity to the liverwort (Marchantia polymorpha) mitochondrial RPS4 polypeptide. Both higher plant mitochondrial genes have an inserted sequence (of 137 and 141 codons for rapeseed and rice, respectively) relative to the liverwort rps4 gene. In rice rps4, the 3' portion of the inserted sequence can potentially form two stem-loop structures that resemble two domains characteristic of group II introns, i.e., domains V and VI. However, RT-PCR analysis showed that these sequences were not spliced out during maturation of the rps4 transcripts. Antibodies specific for the plant RPS4 proteins were prepared. Protein blot analysis revealed that RPS4 polypeptides are present in both rapeseed and rice mitochondria, whose sizes are in agreement with the molecular weights calculated from the non-spliced sequences. The rps4 genes and RPS4 polypeptides have been also identified in the mitochondria of wheat, maize, soybean, and turnip by Southern and Western analyses, respectively."

We have cloned a cDNA (Rir1a) and a closely related gene (Rir1b) corresponding to transcripts that accumulate in leaf tissue upon inoculation with P. syringae pv. syringae. The cDNA encodes a putative 107 amino acid protein, Rir1a, that exhibits a putative signal peptide cleavage site in its hydrophobic N-terminal part and a C-terminal part that is relatively rich in glycine and proline. The Rir1b gene contains a Tourist and a Wanderer miniature transposable element in its single intron and encodes a nearly identical protein. Rir1a is similar in sequence (ca. 35% identical and ca. 60% conservatively changed amino acids) to the putative Wir1 family of proteins that are encoded by pathogen-induced transcripts in wheat. Using antibodies raised against a Rir1a-fusion protein we show that Rir1a is secreted from rice protoplasts transiently expressing a 35S::Rir1a construct and that the protein accumulates in the cell wall compartment of rice leaves upon inoculation with P. syringae pv. syringae. Possible roles of Rir1a in pathogen defense are discussed."

"11431702","abstracttext","Historically, association tests have been used extensively in medical genetics, but have had virtually no application in plant genetics. One obstacle to their application is the structured populations often found in crop plants, which may lead to nonfunctional, spurious associations. In this study, statistical methods to account for population structure were extended for use with quantitative variation and applied to our evaluation of maize flowering time. Mutagenesis and quantitative trait locus (QTL) studies suggested that the maize gene Dwarf8 might affect the quantitative variation of maize flowering time and plant height. The wheat orthologs of this gene contributed to the increased yields seen in the 'Green Revolution' varieties. We used association approaches to evaluate Dwarf8 sequence polymorphisms from 92 maize inbred lines. Population structure was estimated using a Bayesian analysis of 141 simple sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Our results indicate that a suite of polymorphisms associate with differences in flowering time, which include a deletion that may alter a key domain in the coding region. The distribution of nonsynonymous polymorphisms suggests that Dwarf8 has been a target of selection."

"11311346","abstracttext","Maize streak virus (MSV) is the most economically significant member of a diverse group of African grass-infecting Mastrevirus species in the family Geminiviridae. We designed a single set of degenerate primers which enables the PCR amplification of an approximately 1300 bp DNA fragment spanning both conserved (the RepA gene) and variable (the long intergenic region and MP gene) portions of these viruses' genomes. Using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of PCR products obtained from 39 MSV, one SSV, and two PanSV isolates, it was possible to both identify the different virus species, which differ in nucleotide sequence by up to 40%, and to differentiate between MSV isolates sharing up to 99% sequence identity. The reliability of the RFLP data for typing the MSV isolates was verified by the phylogenetic analysis of the partial genomic nucleotide sequences of a representative subset of the MSV isolates. Based on both the RFLP and sequence data, the MSV isolates could be clearly differentiated into the four groups: these were a group of predominantly maize-infecting isolates, and three groups containing grass/wheat-infecting isolates. RFLP analysis also revealed a number of mixed virus infections in which, in certain instances, it was possible to identify individual population members."

"11341729","abstracttext","A population of 100 F6-derived recombinant inbred lines was developed from the cross of two diploid (2n = 14) Avena accessions, CI3815 (A. strigosa) and C11994 (A. wiestii). Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) probes previously mapped in other grass species were used to develop a framework linkage map suitable for comparative genetics. Nine linkage groups were identified among the 181 loci mapped, with an average interlocus distance of 5 cM, and a total genetic map length of 880 cM. A cluster of five tightly linked crown rust resistance genes (Pca) was localized on the map, as were five loci identified by disease resistance gene analogs from maize, sorghum, and wheat. None of the five loci identified by the gene analogs were linked to the Pca locus. The linkage map was compared with previously published diploid and hexaploid linkage maps in an attempt to identify homologous or homoeologous chromosomes between populations. Locus orders and linkage relationships were poorly conserved between the A. strigosa x A. wiestii map and other Avena maps. In spite of mapping complications due to duplications within a basic genome a well as the allopolyploid constitution of many Avena species, such map comparisons within Avena provide further evi dence of substantial chromosomal rearrangement between species within Avena."

"11080301","abstracttext","Antifreeze proteins similar to two different chitinases accumulate during cold acclimation in winter rye (Secale cereale). To determine whether these cold-responsive chitinases require post-translational modification to bind to ice, cDNAs coding for two different full-length chitinases were isolated from a cDNA library produced from cold-acclimated winter rye leaves. CHT9 is a 1,193-bp clone that encodes a 31.7-kD class I chitinase and CHT46 is a 998-bp clone that codes for a 24.8-kD class II chitinase. Chitinase-antifreeze proteins purified from the plant were similar in mass to the predicted mature products of CHT9 and CHT46, thus indicating that there was little chemical modification of the amino acid sequences in planta. To confirm these results, the mature sequences of CHT9 and CHT46 were expressed in Escherichia coli and the products of both cDNAs modified the growth of ice. Transcripts of both genes accumulated late in cold acclimation in winter rye. Southern analysis of winter rye genomic DNA indicated the presence of a small gene family homologous to CHT46. In hexaploid wheat, CHT46 homologs mapped to the homeologous group 1 chromosomes and were expressed in response to cold and drought. We conclude that two novel cold-responsive genes encoding chitinases with ice-binding activity may have arisen in winter rye and other cereals through gene duplication."

"10849198","abstracttext","The nucleus in plants and animals is a highly structured organelle containing several well-defined subregions or suborganelles. These include the nucleolus, interphase chromosome territories and coiled bodies. We have visualized transcription sites in plants at both light- and electron-microscopy level by the incorporation of BrUTP. In the nucleolus many dispersed foci are revealed within the dense fibrillar component, each of which probably corresponds to a single gene copy. In the nucleoplasm there are also many dispersed foci of transcription, but not enough to correspond to one site per transcribed gene. We have shown that in wheat, and probably many other plant species, interphase chromosome territories are organized in a very regular way, with all the chromosomes in the Rabl configuration, all the centromeres clustered at the nuclear membrane and all the telomeres located at the nuclear membrane on the opposite side of the nucleus. However, despite this regular, polarized structure, there is no sign of polarization of transcription sites, or of any preferred location for them with respect to chromosome territorial boundaries. The nucleus is also highly dynamic. As an example, we have shown by the use of a green fluorescent protein fusion to the spliceosomal protein U2B"" that coiled bodies move and coalesce within the nucleus, and may act as transport structures within the nucleus and nucleolus."

"10835258","abstracttext","We prepared a short (29 nucleotides) 5' UTR that enhanced cap-independent translation in a wheat germ translation system by trimming the tobacco etch virus 5' UTR. The trimmed sequence, designated as TE(37-65), was obtained from a conserved region among several potyviruses. The productivities of uncapped reporter mRNAs carrying the TE(37-65) sequence were comparable to those of capped counterparts, in that 5-20 microg of proteins were synthesized per 1 mL of translation reaction mixture. The ribosome that entered onto the TE(37-65) sequence precisely initiated polypeptide synthesis at the defined initiation codon, which ensures rapid and efficient protein truncation analyses. Moreover, the TE(37-65) sequence is short enough to be involved in a PCR primer, which allows a simple method for rapid gene expression, i.e., PCR amplification of a target gene and succeeding in vitro transcription and translation. As a demonstration, the rapid in vitro expression of rice cDNAs using the TE(37-65) sequence was also performed."

"11231294","abstracttext","A novel protein-deamidating enzyme was purified to homogeneity from Chryseobacterium proteolyticum and the gene encoding it was cloned. The enzyme is a monomer with a pI of 10.0, a measured M(r) of approximately 20,000 and a calculated M(r) of 19,860. Extensive comparison with Streptoverticillium transglutaminase showed that the protein-deamidating enzyme lacked transglutaminase activity in terms of hydroxamate-formation between benzyloxycarbonyl-Gln-Gly and hydroxylamine, or monodansylcadaverine incorporation into casein. The enzyme deamidated the two glutaminyl residues in the oxidized insulin A chain and deamidated both casein and the oxidized insulin B chain with higher catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(m)) than with short peptides. The enzyme was active against several proteins, including insoluble wheat gluten, but did not deamidate asparaginyl residues in peptides, free glutamine or other amides. The enzyme was therefore named protein-glutaminase (EC 3.5.1). The gene encoding the protein was cloned and, when expressed in Escherichia coli, the protein product had protein-glutaminase activity and cross-reacted with antiserum raised against the purified enzyme. The protein-glutaminase was shown to be expressed as a prepro-protein with a putative signal peptide of 21 amino acids and a pro-sequence of 114 amino acids. The amino-acid sequence had no obvious homology to any published sequence and is therefore a novel protein-glutaminase."

"11208025","abstracttext","The barley Mla locus confers multiple resistance specificities to the obligate fungal biotroph, Blumeria (= Erysiphe) graminis f. sp. hordei. Interspersed within the 240 kb Mla complex are three families of resistance gene homologs (RGHs). Probes from the Mla-RGH1 family were used to identify three classes of cDNAs. The first class is predicted to encode a full-length CC-NBS-LRR protein and the other two classes contain alternatively spliced, truncated variants. Utilizing a cosmid that contains a gene corresponding to the full-length candidate cDNA, two single-cell expression assays were used to demonstrate complementation of AvrMla6-dependent, resistance specificity to B. graminis in barley and wheat. The first of these assays was also used to substantiate previous genetic data that the Mla6 allele requires the signaling pathway component, Rar1, for function. Computational analysis of MLA6 and the Rar1-independent, MLA1 protein reveals 91.2% identity and shows that the LRR domain is subject to diversifying selection. Our findings demonstrate that highly related CC-NBS-LRR proteins encoded by alleles of the Mla locus can dictate similar powdery mildew resistance phenotypes yet still require distinct downstream signaling components."

"10527420","abstracttext","The expression of the mat-r locus (mat-r-nad1e-nad5III) was studied in wheat mitochondria. Transcription initiation sites were mapped by S1 protection, primer extension and capping experiments. Two different transcription initiation sites were found. One, non-canonical promoter of low expression level generates a transcript containing the complete mat-r open reading frame (orf), suggesting that this form is the maturase-reverse transcriptase mRNA. A second transcription initiation site, found within the coding region of the mat-r orf, directs the transcription of an abundant co-transcript containing the carboxy-terminal region of the mat-r orf, exon e of the nad1 gene, exon III of the nad5 gene and their respective trains-introns. The co-transcript promoter carries the consensus motif of plant mitochondrial promoters. Analysis of transcript sequences reveals the presence of editing sites in analogous positions in both nad1e and nad5III trans-introns, suggesting that RNA editing is necessary for the trans-splicing process."

"10425751","abstracttext","The rrs (16S rDNA) gene sequences of nitrogen-fixing endospore-forming bacilli isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat and maize were determined in order to infer their phylogenetic position in the Bacillaceae. These rhizosphere strains form a monophyletic cluster with Paenibacillus azotofixans, Paenibacillus polymyxa and Paenibacillus macerans. Two of them (RSA19 and TOD45) had previously been identified as Bacillus circulans (group 2) by phenotypic characterization (API 50CH). Evidence for nitrogen fixation by P. azotofixans, P. polymyxa, P. macerans and putative B. circulans strains RSA19 and TOD45 was provided by acetylene-reduction activity, and confirmed by amplifying and sequencing a nifH fragment (370 nt). The phylogenetic tree of nifH-derived amino acid sequences was compared to the phylogenetic tree of rrs sequences. All Paenibacillus nifH sequences formed a coherent cluster distinct from that of related nitrogen-fixing anaerobic clostridia and Gram-positive high-G+C-content frankiae. The nifH gene was neither detected in the B. circulans type strain (ATCC 4513T) nor in the type strains of Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus alcalophilus, Bacillus simplex, Brevibacillus brevis and Paenibacillus validus. Accordingly, nitrogen fixation among aerobic endospore-forming Firmicutes seems to be restricted to a subset of species in the genus Paenibacillus."

"10701130","abstracttext","The wheat homoeologous Group 5 chromosomes were characterized physically in terms of rice linkage blocks using a deletion mapping approach. All three chromosomes, 5A, 5B, and 5D, were shown to have a similar structure, apart from the 4A-5A translocation on the distal end of chromosome arm 5AL. The physical mapping of rice markers on the deletion lines revealed that the whole of rice chromosome 9 is syntenous to a large block, proximal to the centromere, on the long arm. Likewise, a small segment of the distal end of the long arm showed conserved synteny with the distal one-third end of the long arm of rice chromosome 3. In between those conserved regions, there is a region on the long arm of the Group 5 chromosomes which shows broken synteny. The proximal part of the short arms of the Group 5 chromosomes showed conserved synteny with a segment of the short arm of rice chromosome 11 and the distal ends showed conserved synteny with a segment of rice chromosome 12. The physical locations of flowering time genes (Vrn and earliness per se) and the gene for grain hardness (Ha) on the Group 5 chromosomes were determined. These results indicate that comparative mapping using the deletion mapping approach is useful in the study of genome relationships, the physical location of genes, and can determine the appropriate gene cloning strategy."

"10778756","abstracttext","The wheat gene WPK4 encodes a 56-kDa protein kinase that belongs to group 3 of the SNF1-related protein kinase family (SnRK3), and is up-regulated by light and cytokinins and down-regulated by sucrose. In order to determine whether or not this particular regulation pattern is general among plant species, we isolated and characterized homologous genes from rice and maize. Two rice genes, OsPK4 and OsPK7, encode proteins comprising 508 and 520 amino acids, and show, respectively, 75% and 76% sequence similarity to WPK4. OsPK4 and OsPK7 proteins produced in Escherichia coli were able to phosphorylate themselves and myelin basic proteins, the reaction requiring magnesium and/or manganese ions. Transcripts of OsPK4 were detected in all tissues tested, and amounts were increased upon illumination, nutrient deprivation and treatment with cytokinins. In contrast, transcripts of OsPK7 were not found in any tissues except in mature leaves at low levels, and did not accumulate under any of the stress conditions examined. A maize gene, ZmPK4, encodes a protein with 518 amino acids that shows 74% similarity to WPK4. Its transcripts were constitutively expressed in all tissues, regardless of light, nutrient and cytokinin status, but were increased upon exposure to low temperature. These results indicate that, despite the sequence similarity between their products, genes for SnRK3 proteins are differentially regulated in response to environmental stimuli."

"11550882","abstracttext","Terminal deletions of chromosome 1B in common wheat were selected on a large scale. The gametocidal gene of Aegilops cylindrica was used as the inducer of chromosome breakage. First, genes for endosperm storage proteins located on both arms of chromosome 1B were used as the selection markers. However, it was found that the chromosome breakage occurred during female gametogenesis, causing genotypic inconsistency between the embryo and endosperm. Thus, we isolated plants with terminal deletions in chromosome 1B by C-banding. Of 1327 plants examined, 128 showed aberrations in chromosome 1B: 47 in the short arm, 76 in the long arm, and 5 in both arms. The present deletions tended to have the breakpoint at more proximal regions than those produced previously by T.R. Endo and B.S. Gill. Using 33 deletion lines produced in this study and 34 lines previously produced, we mapped 39 RFLP loci and a nucleolar organizer region (NOR) on a specific region of chromosome 1B. The NOR was found to consist of two subregions with different repetitive units, which were termed NOR-Bld and NOR-Blp. Based on this fine deletion map and genotypic inconsistency between embryo and endosperm, the features of the gametocidal gene are discussed."

"11891864","abstracttext","Many transcription factors are demonstrated as being glycosylated with O-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) residue in transfected insect cell lines, but rarely in the original cells. For the first time, we demonstrate the O-GlcNAc modification of the p48/p46 Pax-6 gene (a developmental control gene involved in the eye morphogenesis) products in the quail neuroretina (QNR). In conjunction with a systematic PNGase F treatment, we used wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binding, in vitro labeling with bovine galactosyltransferase, and labeling of cultured QNR with [14C]GlcNH2. Glycosylated forms of Pax-6 proteins were found in the nucleus of the neuroretina cells. WGA-selected Pax-6 proteins produced in the reticulocyte lysate were able to bind a DNA target, as well as to the unglycosylated form. The O-GlcNAc may, however, modulate protein interactions, mainly with other factors involved in the transcription process. Characterization of products released after reductive alkaline treatment of the proteins clearly demonstrates that N-acetylglucosamine is directly linked to serine or threonine residues. Examination of Pax-6 primary sequence allowed us to determine potential O-GlcNAc attachment sites. Most of these expected glycosylation sites appear to be located on the two DNA binding domains and on the carboxyterminal transactivation domain, while experimental evidence taken from WGA-selected proteins experiment points in favor of a main localization on the paired-box domain."

"11704678","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA) regulates seed maturation, germination, and adaptation of vegetative tissues to environmental stresses. The mechanisms of ABA action and the specificity conferred by signaling components in overlapping pathways are not completely understood. The ABI5 gene (ABA insensitive 5) of Arabidopsis encodes a basic leucine zipper factor required for ABA response in the seed and vegetative tissues. Using transient gene expression in rice protoplasts, we provide evidence for the functional interactions of ABI5 with ABA signaling effectors VP1 (viviparous 1) and ABI1 (ABA insensitive 1). Co-transformation experiments with ABI5 cDNA constructs resulted in specific transactivation of the ABA-inducible wheat Em, Arabidopsis AtEm6, bean beta-Phaseolin, and barley HVA1 and HVA22 promoters. Furthermore, ABI5 interacted synergistically with ABA and co-expressed VP1, indicating that ABI5 is involved in ABA-regulated transcription mediated by VP1. ABI5-mediated transactivation was inhibited by overexpression of abi1-1, the dominant-negative allele of the protein phosphatase ABI1, and by 1-butanol, a competitive inhibitor of phospholipase D involved in ABA signaling. Lanthanum, a trivalent ion that acts as an agonist of ABA signaling, potentiated ABI5 transactivation. These results demonstrate that ABI5 is a key target of a conserved ABA signaling pathway in plants."

"15620214","abstracttext","Suppression subtractive hybridization was carried out to enrich gene fragments over-expressed in rice leaves by subtraction to rice roots, from which two identical cDNA fragments were identified to encode putative phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. Then the corresponding full-length cDNA (Osppc) is isolated by RT-PCR and sequenced, which indicates an open reading frame of 2895bp is contained. Its deduced protein is encoded in 10 exons and shows high similarity to many other plant PEPCs. Comparing with maize and bacterial PEPCs, it is revealed that OSPPC shares many conserved domains and active sites that responsible for the structure, activity and regulation of this enzyme. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that OSPPC is grouped with C3 form PEPCs of wheat, maize and sorghum, which is consistent with the classification of rice. And a putative promoter element is predicted with DOF binding box, CAAT box and TATA box in the 5'-flanking sequence of Osppc gene. Moreover, Quantitative RT-PCR analyses are performed in hybrid rice and its parents, which show that Osppc is specifically expressed in leaf including leaf vein and sheath."

"15481828","abstracttext","The molecular basis and mode of inheritance of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides were investigated in a biotype of Lolium rigidum Gaud that has been discovered in Israel. Dose-response experiments at the whole-plant level have revealed that the resistant biotype was more resistant (6.3- to 40-fold) than the susceptible wild-type to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides. A 276-bp genomic DNA encoding the carboxyltransferase domain within the chloroplastic ACCase from resistant and susceptible biotypes were amplified by PCR and analyzed. Sequence comparison revealed that a single isoleucine-to-leucine substitution differentiated ACCases from susceptible and resistant biotypes (corresponds to residue 1769 of wheat ACCase, Acc No AF029895). A PCR amplification of specific alleles (PASA) method was developed to detect the allele composition leading to isoleucine-leucine mutation. ACCase extracted from homozygote resistant, heterozygote and homozygote susceptible plants showed IC50 values of 25.8, 5.6 and 0.6 microM, respectively, suggesting that alteration in the ACCase is governed by a co-dominant gene. The inheritance studies confirmed that the resistance of L rigidum to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides is governed by a single, nuclear and co-dominant gene."

"15363843","abstracttext","Three ASF/SF2-like alternative splicing genes from maize were identified, cloned, and analyzed. Each of these genes (zmSRp30, zmSRp31, and zmSRp32) contains two RNA binding domains, a signature sequence SWQDLKD, and a characteristic serine/ariginine-rich domain. There is a strong structural similarity to the human ASF/SF2 splicing factor and to the Arabidopsis atSRp34/p30 proteins. Similar to ASF/SF2-like genes in other organisms, the maize pre-mRNA messages are alternatively spliced. They are differentially expressed in maize tissues with relatively uniform levels of zmSRp30 and zmSRp31 messages being observed throughout the plant, while zmSRp32 messages preferentially accumulated in the meristematic regions. Overexpression of zmSRp32 in maize cells leads to the enhanced selection of weak 5' intron splice sites during the processing of pre-mRNA molecules. Overexpression of the zmSRp31 or zmSRp32 gene affects regulation of wheat dwarf virus rep gene pre-mRNA splicing, presumably by interacting with the weak 5' splice site, CCGU. Our results suggest that the described genes are functional homologues of the human ASF/SF2 alternative splicing factor and they indicate a diversity of the ASF/SF2-like alternative splicing factors in monocot plant cells."

"12468599","abstracttext","To gain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of dietary protein on alternations in physiologic and pathologic status, the GeneChip microarray system was used to investigate the consequences of two different states of protein malnutrition on gene expression in rat liver. Expressions of 281 genes were increased or decreased by twofold or more by treatment with a protein-free diet for 1 wk compared with control rats fed a casein diet. Similarly, 111 genes were affected in rats fed a wheat gluten diet compared with those fed the casein diet. Although some of the genes identified were known to respond to protein nutrition, a majority were newly identified as responders to protein nutritional status. Interesting findings included the drastic changes in the levels of genes for Id (inhibitor of DNA binding) proteins, which are involved in the regulation of multiple genes, and of a set of genes in the pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis and disposal. This study represents a step toward a more global understanding of gene expression changes in states of protein malnutrition."

ToxA was localized to a 3.0 Mb chromosome. PCR-based subtraction was carried out with the ToxA chromosome as tester DNA and genomic DNA from a non-pathogenic isolate as driver DNA. Seven of 8 single-copy probes that originated from the 3.0 Mb chromosome could be assigned to a 2.75 Mb chromosome of a non-pathogenic isolate. Nine different repetitive DNA probes originated from the 3.0 Mb chromosome, including sequences that correspond to known fungal transposable elements. Two additional single-copy probes that originated from a 3.4 Mb chromosome were unique to the pathogens and they correspond to a peptide synthetase gene. Our findings suggest substantial differences between pathogenic and non-pathogenic isolates of P. tritici-repentis."

"12072386","abstracttext","As glucose-induced insulin expression is mainly regulated at the translational level, and such regulation often involves the 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), we examined the human proinsulin gene 5'UTR. RT-PCR and sequencing demonstrated that a proinsulin splice variant (SPV) generated from a cryptic 5'-splice site and retaining the first 26 bp of intron 1 was present in human pancreatic islets from normal donors. The expression of this SPV was metabolically regulated, as shown by quantitative real-time RT-PCR, revealing a more than 10-fold increase in the SPV in isolated human islets incubated at 16.7 mM compared with 1.67 mM glucose. In vitro wheat-germ translation and in vivom transfection studies demonstrated that the altered 5'UTR of the SPV increased translation. The SPV yielded 4-fold more in vitro translated preproinsulin protein than the native proinsulin mRNA, and the SPV 5'UTR inserted upstream from a luciferase reporter gene resulted in a more than 6-fold higher luciferase activity, suggesting enhanced translation in vivo. Retention of the 26 bp changed the proposed secondary RNA structure of the SPV, which may facilitate ribosomal binding and explain the increase in translation efficiency. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which metabolic changes can modulate the expression of 5'UTR SPVs and thereby regulate translation efficiency."

"12072477","abstracttext","Comparative mapping of cereals has shown that chromosomes of barley, wheat, and maize can be described in terms of rice ""linkage segments."" However, little is known about marker order in the junctions between linkage blocks or whether this will impair comparative analysis of major genes that lie in such regions. We used genetic and physical mapping to investigate the relationship between the distal part of rice chromosome 7L, which contains the Hd2 heading date gene, and the region of barley chromosome 2HS containing the Ppd-H1 photoperiod response gene, which lies near the junction between rice 7 and rice 4 linkage segments. RFLP markers were mapped in maize to identify regions that might contain Hd2 or Ppd-H1 orthologs. Rice provided useful markers for the Ppd-H1 region but comparative mapping was complicated by loss of colinearity and sequence duplications that predated the divergence of rice, maize, and barley. The sequences of cDNA markers were used to search for homologs in the Arabidopsis genome. Homologous sequences were found for 13 out of 16 markers but they were dispersed in Arabidopsis and did not identify any candidate equivalent region. The implications of the results for comparative trait mapping in junction regions are discussed."

In the advanced lines, about 70% of the plants examined had 2n = 56 chromosomes (range: 50 to 58). Almost all advanced lines, however, had lost rye chromosome 2R and the short arm of 5R (5RS). The exceptions were lines Y1005 and Y4683: The former had lost only the 2R chromosome and the latter only 5RS. The reduction of rye chromosomes was compensated by an extra pair of 2D or A-genome (possibly 2A) chromosomes in plants with 2n = 56. This suggests that the loss of 2R and 5RS chromosomes contributes to the improvement of octoploid triticale. Since the plants with chromosome 2R are non-free threshing and chromosome 2D of synthetic wheat is known to carry the Tg (tenacious glumes) gene, it is possible that chromosome 2R carries a gene affecting the threshability, and we carried out selection to remove it. We also discuss the possible relationshipbetween 5RS and the genetic stability of octoploid triticale."

"12807905","abstracttext","Charge-neutral DNA nanoparticles have been developed in which single molecules of DNA are compacted to their minimal possible size. We speculated that the small size of these DNA nanoparticles may facilitate gene transfer in postmitotic cells, permitting nuclear uptake across the 25-nm nuclear membrane pore. To determine whether DNA nanoparticles can transfect nondividing cells, growth-arrested neuroblastoma and hepatoma cells were transfected with DNA/liposome mixtures encoding luciferase. In both models, growth-arrested cells were robustly transfected by compacted DNA (6,900-360-fold more than naked DNA). To evaluate mechanisms responsible for enhanced transfection, HuH-7 cells were microinjected with naked or compacted plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein. Cytoplasmic microinjection of DNA nanoparticles generated a approximately 10-fold improvement in transgene expression as compared with naked DNA; this enhancement was reversed by the nuclear pore inhibitor, wheat germ agglutinin. To determine the upper size limit for gene transfer, DNA nanoparticles of various sizes were microinjected into the cytoplasm. A marked decrease in transgene expression was observed as the minor ellipsoidal diameter approached 25 nm. In summary, suitably sized DNA nanoparticles productively transfect growth arrested cells by traversing the nuclear membrane pore."
"12956534","articletitle","Rare instances of Cre-mediated deletion product maintained in transgenic wheat."
"12956534","abstracttext","Previously, we described a Cre-lox based strategy to convert a complex multi-copy integration pattern to a single-copy transgene (Srivastava et al., 1999). When a lox-containing transgenic line of wheat was crossed with a cre-expressing line, extra copies of the transgene were deleted by site-specific recombination. This process included the removal of a lox-flanked selection marker gene, bar. Three out of six F1 plants were chimeric for the resolved and the complex loci because both completely resolved and incompletely resolved patterns were found in the F2 population. From one F1 plant, 4 out of 20 F2 progeny showed not only incomplete resolution of the complex integration pattern, but also the presence of a circular loxP-bar-nos3' fragment, which we refer to as the bar circle. This bar circle was detected in subsequent generations, and was associated with the presence of both the lox transgene and the cre locus. We hypothesize that the cre gene in these bar circle plants must have undergone a genetic or epigenetic change that altered the spatial and/or temporal pattern of cre expression. Late expression might excise the DNA incompletely, and late in development. What is surprising is that the DNA is not degraded, but remains in the cells as an extra-chromosomal circular molecule."

"15735966","abstracttext","Exopolysaccharides (EPS) produced in situ by sourdough lactobacilli affect rheological properties of dough as well as bread quality and may serve as prebiotics. The aim of this study was to characterize EPS-formation by Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis TMW 1.392 at the molecular level. A levansucrase gene from L. sanfranciscensis TMW 1.392 encompassing 2,300 bp was sequenced. This levansucrase is predicted to be a cell-wall associated protein of 879 amino acids with a relative molecular weight (M(R)) of 90,000. The levansucrase gene was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity. The recombinant enzyme exhibited transferase and hydrolase activities and produced glucose, fructose, 1-kestose and levan from sucrose; truncation of the N-terminal domain did not affect catalytic activity. Kestose formation was enhanced relative to fructose and levan formation by low temperature or high sucrose levels. During growth in wheat doughs, strain TMW 1.392 utilized sucrose to form fructose, 1-kestose, and fructan, whereas a levansucrase deletion mutant, L. sanfranciscensis TMW 1392Deltalev, lost the ability to hydrolyze sucrose, and did not produce fructan or 1-kestose. These results indicate that, in L. sanfranciscensis TMW 1.392, sucrose metabolism and formation of fructan and 1-kestose is dependent on the activity of a single enzyme, levansucrase."

"15972848","abstracttext","Introgressive hybridization has played a crucial role in the evolution of many plant species, especially polyploids. The duplicated genetic material and wide geographical distribution facilitate hybridization and introgression among polyploid species having either homologous or homoeologous genomes. Such introgression may lead to the production of recombinant genomes that are more difficult to form at the diploid level. Crop genes that have introgressed into wild relatives can increase the capability of the wild relatives to adapt to agricultural environments and compete with crops or to compete with other wild species. Although the transfer of genes from crops into their conspecific immediate wild progenitors has been reported, little is known about spontaneous gene movement from crops to more distantly related species. We describe recent spontaneous DNA introgression from domesticated polyploid wheat into distantly related, wild tetraploid Aegilops peregrina (syn. Aegilops variabilis) and the stabilization of this sequence in wild populations despite not having homologous chromosomes. Our results show that DNA can spontaneously introgress between homoeologous genomes of species of the tribe Triticeae and, in the case of crop-wild relatives, possibly enrich the wild population. These results also emphasize the need for fail-safe mechanisms in transgenic crops to prevent gene flow where there may be ecological risks."

These tissues were induced from mature seeds on NB-based medium containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), 6-benzylaminopurine (BAP) and high concentrations of cupric sulfate under dim light conditions; germinating shoots and roots were completely removed. Highly regenerative, green tissues were proliferated on the same medium and used as transformation targets. From 431 explants bombarded with transgenes [i.e. a hygromycin phosphotransferase ( hpt) gene plus one of a wheat thioredoxin h ( wtrxh), a barley NADP-thioredoxin reductase ( bntr), a maize Mutator transposable element ( mudrB) or beta-glucuronidase ( uidA; gus) gene], 28 independent transgenic events were obtained after an 8- to 12-week selection period, giving a 6.5% transformation frequency. Of the 28 independent events, 17 (61%) were regenerable. Co-transformation of the second introduced transgene was detected in 81% of the transgenic lines tested. Stable integration and expression of the foreign genes in T(0) plants and T(1) progeny were confirmed by DNA hybridization, western blot analyses and germination tests."

"15286987","abstracttext","It has been previously shown that expression of a high-molecular-weight glutenin (HMW-GS) in transgenic wheat seeds resulted in the improvement of flour functional properties. In this study, potato flour viscosity was improved through a specific expression of a low-molecular-weight glutenin (LMW-GS-MB1) gene in tuber. The resulting construct was introduced into potato leaf explants (Solanum tuberosum cv Kennebec) through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated gene transfer. Southern and Northern analysis of transgenic potato confirmed that the integration of LMW-GS-MB1 in genomic DNA was stable and its mRNA was abundant in transgenic line 16 tubers. Western blot analysis of line 16 extract shows a LMW-GS subunit accumulation in tuber. To demonstrate the capacity of transgenic lines to produce tubers with improved flour functional properties, transgenic lines 9 and 16 exhibiting, respectively, moderate and high expression of LMW-GS-MB1 mRNA and nontransgenic plants were transferred to field plots. The mean viscosity value of flour obtained from the field-grown tubers of transgenic line 16 exhibited a 3-fold increase in viscosity at 23 degrees C when compared to flour from nontransgenic tubers."

"15306011","abstracttext","A gene encoding malate synthase, a key enzyme of the glyoxylate cycle, has been cloned and characterized in the necrotrophic wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum. Expression studies of Mls1 showed high levels of transcript in ungerminated spores whereas malate synthase enzyme activities were low. Expression studies in planta found that Mls1 transcript levels decreased approximately 10-fold upon germination before slowly increasing throughout the remainder of the infection. To characterize Mls1 further, the gene was disrupted in S. nodorum by homologous recombination. In the absence of any supplied carbon source, the mls1 spores were unable to germinate and consequently the mutants were non-pathogenic. Germination and pathogenicity could be restored by the addition of either glucose or sucrose, implying that S. nodorum is reliant upon the catabolism of lipids for infection. Furthermore, analysis of lipid bodies in the mutant strain indicated that lipid mobilization and, consequently, peroxisomal beta-oxidation of fatty acids is delayed or inhibited by the disruption of the glyoxylate cycle. This study has demonstrated for the first time in a fungal phytopathogen the requirement of malate synthase for pathogenicity, suggesting that gluconeogenesis is both dependent on the glyoxylate cycle and required for infection."

"15141949","abstracttext","Gna1, a gene encoding a Galpha subunit, a key component of signal transduction pathways, has been cloned and characterized in the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum. Analysis of Gna1 expression during infection revealed a slight decrease in transcript levels shortly after germination, after which levels steadily increased until sporulation. Inactivation of Gna1 had a pleiotropic effect on phenotype. The Gna1 mutants were less pathogenic, attributed to coinciding with a defect in direct penetration. Also, Gna1 mutants were unable to sporulate, showed an albino phenotype, and secreted one or more brown pigments into growth media. Analysis of growth medium identified tyrosine, phenylalanine, and dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) were excreted by the Gna1 strains but not by wild type. The presence of these compounds, and the insensitivity of melanization to tricyclazole suggest that S. nodorum synthesizes melanin via the L-DOPA pathway, the first fungal phytopathogen described to do so. Decreases in protease (and several other depolymerases) activities and sensitivity to osmotic stress were other phenotypes identified in the Gna1 mutants. Gna1 is the first signal transduction gene to be cloned and characterized from S. nodorum and its inactivation has uncovered several previously unknown facets of pathogenicity."

"15006424","abstracttext","Several extracellular feruloyl esterases were produced by the mesophilic fungus Talaromyces stipitatus when grown on selective carbon sources in liquid media. Type-A and Type-B feruloyl esterases, as defined by their substrate specificity against methyl hydroxycinnamates, were produced during growth on wheat bran and sugar beet pulp, respectively. In addition, Tal. stipitatus produced a new type of esterase (TsFaeC) during growth on sugar beet pulp with a broader spectrum of activity (Type-C) against the (hydroxy)cinnamate esters than those previously described. All three enzymes were purified and N-terminal amino acid sequences and internal peptide sequences determined. The TsFaeC sequences were used to amplify a gene fragment from Tal. stipitatus genomic DNA. The flanking sequences were identified with the aid of RACE-RTPCR, and a full-length clone constructed. The faeC gene is present as a single copy and contains a single intron. The complete cDNA fragment contains an ORF of 1590bp, faeC, which is predicted to encode a 530 amino acid pre-protein, including a 25-residue signal peptide, and to produce a mature protein of M(R) 55 340Da. There was no evidence for a carbohydrate-binding domain in TsFaeC."

"15247043","abstracttext","We developed a high-throughput screening system that allows identification of genes prolonging life span in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The method is based on isolating yeast mother cells with an extended number of cell divisions as indicated by the increased number of bud scars on their surface. Fluorescently labeled wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was used for specific staining of bud scars. Screening of a human HepG2 cDNA expression library in yeast resulted in the isolation of several yeast transformants with a potentially prolonged life span. The budding yeast S. cerevisiae, one of the favorite models used to study aging, has been studied extensively for the better understanding of the mechanisms of human aging. Because human disease genes often have yeast counterparts, they can be studied efficiently in this organism. One interesting example is the WRN gene, the human DNA helicase, which participates in the DNA repair pathway. The mutation of the WRN gene causes Werner syndrome showing premature-aging phenotype. Budding yeast contains WRN homologue, SGS1, and its mutation results in shortening yeast life span. The knowledge gained from the studies of budding yeast will benefit studies in humans for better understanding of aging and aging-related disease."

"15086824","abstracttext","Wheat dwarf geminivirus (WDV) is a single-stranded DNA Mastrevirus. The large intergenic region (LIR) of WDV contains cis-acting elements essential for the replication of the genome as well as for the bidirectional transcription of virus genes. The LIR was fused to the GUS (uidA) reporter gene and the WDV viral sense (V-sense) promoter activity derived from the stable integration of that promoter was analysed in transgenic dicot plants. Various dicot species were tested, including Nicotiana tabacum, Nicotiana benthamiana, Arabidopsis thaliana and Cucumis melo. The GUS activity driven by the WDV promoter was also compared to that obtained in plants transformed with the GUS gene controlled by the CaMV 35S promoter as well as two phloem-specific promoters derived from the Arabidopsis thaliana AtSUC2 and AtAHA3 genes. Histochemistry showed that the WDV V-sense promoter consistently induced an expression pattern restricted to the vascular tissues, predominantly in the phloem of all organs. This promoter exhibited levels of GUS activity comparable to that driven by AtSUC2 and AtAHA3 promoters. A vascular expression pattern was observed in the four dicots tested. This was stable during plant development and was not altered following viral infection by an unrelated geminivirus. The uses of such a promoter are discussed regarding the targeting to the phloem of molecules active against vascular pests or pathogens."

"16019807","abstracttext","The major products of the trichothecene mycotoxin biosynthetic pathway produced in a species- and sometimes isolate-specific manner by cereal-pathogenic Fusarium fungi include T-2 toxin, diacetoxyscirpenol, deoxynivalenol and nivalenol. This paper briefly reviews the major effects of such trichothecenes on the gross morphology, cytology and molecular signalling within eukaryotic cells. The gross toxic effects of select trichothecenes on animals include growth retardation, reduced ovarian function and reproductive disorders, immuno-compromization, feed refusal and vomiting. The phytotoxic effects of deoxynivalenol on plants can be summarized as growth retardation, inhibition of seedling and green plant regeneration. Trichothecenes are now recognized as having multiple inhibitory effects on eukaryote cells, including inhibition of protein, DNA and RNA synthesis, inhibition of mitochondrial function, effects on cell division and membrane effects. In animal cells, they induce apoptosis, a programmed cell death response. Current knowledge about the eukaryotic signal transduction cascades and downstream gene products activated by trichothecenes is limited, especially in plants. In mammalian cells, certain trichothecenes trigger a ribotoxic stress response and activate mitogen-activated protein kinases. DON mediates the inflammatory response by modulating the binding activities of specific transcription factors and subsequently inducing cytokine gene expression. Several genes are up-regulated in wheat in response to trichothecene mycotoxins; the significance, if any, of these genes in the host response to trichothecenes has yet to be elucidated."

"16453616","abstracttext","The gene for CF(0) subunit I of ATP synthase has been located in wheat chloroplast DNA, between the genes for CF(0) subunit III and alpha subunit of CF(1). Nucleotide sequencing and analysis of RNA-DNA hybrids indicated that the gene is interrupted by an 823-bp intron which has boundaries similar to those previously described for the introns in protein-coding chloroplast genes of Euglena gracilis. The deduced amino acid sequence of CF(0) subunit I indicates a polypeptide of 183 amino acid residues. However, N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the mature spinach CF(0) subunit I suggests that the protein is synthesised with a N-terminal extension of 17 amino acid residues and is processed to give a protein of mol. wt. 19 001 of 166 amino acids residues. The mature CF(0) subunit I shows similarities in primary and predicted secondary structure to F(0) subunit b of Escherichia coli ATP synthase. A major transcript of 3.3 kb containing sequences from the genes for CF(0) subunit III, subunit I and CF(1) subunit alpha has been observed by RNA-DNA hybridisation."

"16636992","abstracttext","Genetic diversity within populations of Fusarium pseudograminearum isolated from wheat grains from the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan was investigated. Three restriction enzymes (EcoRI, HaeIII, and PstI) were used to carry out restriction analysis of the nuclear ribosomal DNA (nrDNA) intergenic spacer region (IGS region) and eight primers were used to generate inter-simple sequence-repeat (ISSR) molecular markers. Our study indicated substantially high genetic diversity within these two populations, but low genetic differentiation and frequent gene flow among populations. The IGS data showed no genetic distinction between the two Alberta populations and only minor genetic differentiation between the Saskatchewan and Alberta populations. Analysis of molecular variance indicated that most genetic variability resulted from differences among isolates within populations. Multilocus linkage disequilibrium analysis suggested a panmictic population genetic structure and the occurrence of significant recombination in F. pseudograminearum. Regular gene flow and random mating between isolates from different populations could result in novel genotypes with both improved pathological and biological traits."

"16810504","abstracttext","Isolation of mitotic chromosomes using flow cytometry is an attractive way to dissect nuclear genomes into their individual chromosomal components or portions of them. This approach is especially useful in plants with complex genomes, where it offers a targeted and hence economical approach to genome analysis and gene cloning. In several plant species, DNA of flow-sorted chromosomes has been used for isolation of molecular markers from specific genome regions, for physical mapping using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), for integration of genetic and physical maps and for construction of chromosome-specific DNA libraries, including those cloned in bacterial artificial chromosome vectors. Until now, chromosome analysis and sorting using flow cytometry (flow cytogenetics) has found little application in barley (2n = 14, 1C approximately 5,100 Mbp) because of the impossibility of discriminating and sorting individual chromosomes, except for the smallest chromosome 1H and some translocation chromosomes with DNA content significantly different from the remaining chromosomes. In this work, we demonstrate that wheat-barley ditelosomic addition lines can be used to sort any arm of barley chromosomes 2H-7H. Thus, the barley genome can be dissected into fractions representing only about 6-12% of the total genome. This advance makes the flow cytogenetics an attractive tool, which may greatly facilitate genome analysis and gene cloning in barley."

Four plots from each site were used to determine grain dry weight, grain nitrogen, dough strength (measured as peak resistance by Mixograph analysis) and the expression levels of the endogenous and ""added"" subunits. Detailed statistical analyses showed that the transgenic and non-transgenic lines did not differ in terms of stability of HMW subunit gene expression or in stability of grain nitrogen, dry weight or dough strength, either between the 3 years or between sites and plots. These results indicate that the transgenic and control lines can be regarded as substantially equivalent in terms of stability of gene expression between generations and environments."

"16894215","abstracttext","Mutations within the HC-Pro coding region of Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) were introduced by misincorporation during PCR and evaluated for phenotype within the context of an infectious clone. Nine synonymous substitutions and 15 of 25 non-synonymous substitutions had no phenotypic effect. Four non-synonymous substitutions, including one that reverted consistently to wild type, resulted in attenuated systemic infection. Six non-synonymous substitutions and one nonsense substitution abolished systemic infectivity. Mutants bearing the GUS reporter gene were evaluated for the ability to establish primary infection foci. All attenuated mutants and two systemic infection-deficient mutants produced localized regions of GUS expression on inoculated leaves 3 days post-inoculation. In vitro assays revealed that mutants able to establish infection foci retained HC-Pro proteinase activity. Among mutants unable to establish infection foci, HC-Pro proteinase activity was retained, reduced or absent. As a complete HC-Pro deletion mutant can infect plants systemically, certain substitutions in this dispensable gene probably prevented infection of WSMV via interference."

"19266903","abstracttext","In this study, we exploit the useful described CODEHOP primer design and RT-PCR strategy for targeted isolation of homologues in large gene families. The method was tested with two different objectives. The first was to apply CODEHOP strategy for design degenerate oligonucleotide primers in a broad range of plant species. The second was to isolate an orthologus of the transcription factor of dehydration-responsive element binding protein (DREB) and to determine the complexity of gene family in bread wheat. We used a new primer design strategy for PCR amplification of unknown targets that are related to multiply-aligned protein sequences. Each primer consists of a short 3' degenerate core region and a longer 5' consensus clamp region. Only 3-4 highly conserved amino acid residues are necessary for design of the core, which is stabilized by the clamp annealing to templates molecules. This provides the possibility of isolating numerous additional DREB genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) with degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The relationship of the amplified products to DREB genes was evaluated by several sequence and genetic criteria. Present data show that expression of DREB and its homologues, is induced by low temperature stress. Towards this step, it found that the expression of DRE-regulated genes increased freezing tolerance in plants."

"18944687","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Race-specific resistance genes to powdery mildew have been extensively used in wheat breeding programs, but the complete resistance they provide breaks down when confronted by pathogen isolates with matching virulence. However, when overcome, some race-specific genes have a residual action leading to a reduction of the symptoms. Our objective was to determine if the resistance genes MlRE and Pm4b have a residual effect on adult plant resistance (APR) and on vernalized seedling plant resistance (VPR) in the line RE714. Individuals from two populations (double haploid [DH] and F(3) families) were genotyped for the race-specific genes MlRE and Pm4b and assessed for their resistance under field conditions at the adult plant stage (in 1996 and 1997 for the DH lines and in 1997 for the F(3) families). Vernalized seedlings of the DH population were tested with four powdery mildew isolates. Only the MlRE gene had a significant effect (dominant type) on APR. Neither MlRE nor Pm4b had a significant effect on VPR. The dominant residual effect of the defeated race-specific gene MlRE was a component of APR in the line RE714."

Fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of whole genomes and whole-cell protein electrophoresis confirmed the unique taxonomic status of the novel strain. DNA-DNA hybridizations, DNA G+C content determination, comparative sequence analysis of the pheS, rpoA and atpA genes and physiological and biochemical characterization demonstrated that strain LMG 23999(T) (=CCUG 54535(T)=CRL 776(T)) represents a novel species for which the name Pediococcus argentinicus sp. nov. is proposed.

"18943769","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Partial resistance to Septoria tritici blotch (STB) and its inheritance were investigated in a doubled-haploid population of a cross between cvs. Arina and Riband. The former has good partial resistance whereas the latter is susceptible. In adult plant trials in polytunnels, STB disease scores were negatively correlated with heading date. Resistance was not specific to any of the three fungal isolates used in these tests. A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for partial resistance to STB was identified in Riband on chromosome 6B and is named QStb.psr-6B-1. No QTL controlling a major part of the Arina resistance was identified, suggesting that its resistance may be dispersed and polygenic. There was no correlation between the lines' mean disease scores at the seedling and adult stages, implying that partial resistance to STB is developmentally regulated. Seedling resistance to the isolate IPO323 was isolate-specific and controlled by a single gene in Arina, probably allelic with the Stb6 gene in cv. Flame that confers resistance to the same isolate. The implications of these results for wheat breeding programs are discussed."
"18943886","articletitle","Population Analysis of Fusarium graminearum from Wheat Fields in Eastern China."
"18943886","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Wheat heads showing symptoms of Fusarium head blight were collected from four commercial fields in Zhejiang Province, China, an area where epidemics occur regularly. A total of 225 isolates were subjected to population-level analyses using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) as markers. Diagnostic RFLP markers established that all isolates belonged to Fusarium graminearum lineage 6. Nine polymorphic probes were hybridized to all isolates, resulting in 65 multilocus RFLP haplotypes (MRH). Probing with the telomeric clone pNla17, which reveals differences among isolates in the hypervariable subtelomeric region, differentiated the 65 MRH further into 144 clones. Mean gene diversity for the four field populations was similar, ranging from H = 0.306 - 0.364 over the nine RFLP loci for clone-corrected data. High levels of gene flow were inferred from a low level of population subdivision among all field populations, indicating that they were part of the same population. Pairwise linkage disequilibrium measures did not unequivocally support a random mating population, because one-third of locus pairs were significantly different from the null hypothesis of no-association between alleles. We speculate therefore that sexual recombination may not be frequent and that high levels of genotypic diversity may be maintained by relatively low selection pressure acting on a highly diverse population."

"19412652","abstracttext","Full-length cDNAs are essential for the correct annotation of genomic sequences as well as for the functional analysis of genes and their products. We have isolated about 240,000 RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length (RAFL) cDNA clones. These clones were clustered into about 17,000 non-redundant cDNA groups, i.e., about 60% of all Arabidopsis predicted genes. The sequence information of the RAFL cDNAs is useful for promoter analysis, and for the correct annotation of predicted transcriptional units and gene products. We prepared cDNA microarrays containing independent full-length cDNA groups and studied the expression profiles of genes under various stress- and hormone-treatment conditions, and in various mutants and transgenic plants. These expression profiling studies have shown the expression levels of many genes as a detailed snapshot describing the state of a biological system in planta under various conditions. We have applied RAFL cDNAs to the functional analysis of proteins using the full-length cDNA over-expressing (FOX) gene hunting system and the wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system. The RAFL cDNA collection was also used for determination of the domain structure of proteins by NMR.

"17522826","abstracttext","Gene flow from crops to wild relatives by sexual reproduction is one of the major issues in risk assessment for the cultivation of genetically engineered (GE) plants. The main factors which influence hybridization and introgression, the two processes of gene flow, as well as the accompanying containment measures of the transgene, are reviewed. The comparison of risks between Switzerland and Europe highlights the importance of regional studies. Differences were assessed for barley, beet and wheat. Moreover, transgene flow through several wild species acting as bridge (bridge species) has been up to now poorly investigated. Indeed, transgene flow may go beyond the closest wild relative, as in nature several wild species complexes hybridize. Its importance is assessed by several examples in Poaceae. Finally, the transgene itself has genetic and ecological consequences that are reviewed. Transgenic hybrids between crops and wild relatives may have lower fitness than the wild relatives, but in several cases, no cost was detected. On the other hand, the transgene provides advantages to the hybrids, in the case of selective value as a Bt transgene in the presence of herbivores. Genetic and ecological consequences of a transgene in a wild species are complex and depend on the type of transgene, its insertion site, the density of plants and ecological factors.

"17546098","abstracttext","Wild Triticeae grasses serve as important gene pools for forage and cereal crops. Understanding their genome compositions is pivotal for efficient use of this vast gene pool in germplasm-enhancement programs. Several cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were developed to distinguish the Eb, Ee, and R genomes. With the aid of disomic addition lines of wheat, it was confirmed that all 7 chromosomes of Eb, Ee, and R genomes carry these genome-specific CAPS markers. Thus, the identified CAPS markers are useful in detecting and monitoring the chromosomes of these 3 genomes. This study also provides evidence suggesting that some Purdue and Chinese germplasm lines developed for barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance are different from those developed in Australia. Furthermore, Thinopyrum intermedium and Thinopyrum ponticum were shown to have different genome constitutions. Sequence analyses of the 1272 bp sequences, containing Ty3/gypsy retrotransposons, from the Eb, Ee, and R genomes also shed light on the evolution of these 3 genomes."

"18226935","abstracttext","The mitochondrial genomes of two isolates of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola were sequenced completely and compared to identify polymorphic regions. This organism is of interest because it is phylogenetically distant from other fungi with sequenced mitochondrial genomes and it has shown discordant patterns of nuclear and mitochondrial diversity. The mitochondrial genome of M. graminicola is a circular molecule of approximately 43,960bp containing the typical genes coding for 14 proteins related to oxidative phosphorylation, one RNA polymerase, two rRNA genes and a set of 27 tRNAs. The mitochondrial DNA of M. graminicola lacks the gene encoding the putative ribosomal protein (rps5-like), commonly found in fungal mitochondrial genomes. Most of the tRNA genes were clustered with a gene order conserved with many other ascomycetes. A sample of 35 additional strains representing the known global mt diversity was partially sequenced to measure overall mitochondrial variability within the species. Little variation was found, confirming previous RFLP-based findings of low mitochondrial diversity. The mitochondrial sequence of M. graminicola is the first reported from the family Mycosphaerellaceae or the order Capnodiales. The sequence also provides a tool to better understand the development of fungicide resistance and the conflicting pattern of high nuclear and low mitochondrial diversity in global populations of this fungus."
"18205613","articletitle","A view of an elemental naturalist at the DNA world (base composition, sequences, methylation)."
"18205613","abstracttext","The pioneering data on base composition and pyrimidine sequences in DNA of pro- and eukaryotes are considered, and their significance for the origin of genosystematics is discussed. The modern views on specificity and functional role of enzymatic DNA methylation in eukaryotes are described. DNA methylation controls all genetic functions and is a mechanism of cellular differentiation and gene silencing. A model of regulation of DNA replication by methylation is suggested. Adenine DNA methylation in higher eukaryotes (higher plants) was first observed, and it was established that one and the same gene can be methylated at both cytosine and adenine moieties. Thus, there are at least two different and seemingly interdependent DNA methylation systems present in eukaryotic cells. The first eukaryotic adenine DNA-methyltransferase is isolated from wheat seedlings and described: the enzyme methylates DNA with formation of N6-methyladenine in the sequence TGATCA-->TGm6ATCA. It is found that higher plants have endonucleases that are dependent on S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and sensitive to DNA methylation status. Therefore, as in bacteria, plants seem to have a restriction-modification (R-M) system. A system of conjugated up- and down-regulation of SAM-dependent endonucleases by SAM modulations is found in plants. Revelation of an essential role of DNA methylation in regulation of genetic processes is a fundament of materialization of epigenetics and epigenomics."

"17665369","abstracttext_results","Dose-response studies revealed very high level (>340-fold) resistance to the sulfonylurea herbicides sulfosulfuron and sulfometuron. In vitro ALS assays revealed that resistance was due to reduced sensitivity of the ALS enzyme to herbicide inhibition. This altered ALS sensitivity in the resistant biotypes was found to be due to a mutation in the ALS gene resulting in amino acid proline to serine substitution at position 197. In addition, two- to threefold higher ALS activities were consistently found in the resistant biotypes, compared with the known susceptible biotype. Two cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers were developed for diagnostic testing of the resistant populations."

"17911450","abstracttext","Anti-inflammatory efficacy of the fermented wheat germ extract (FWGE, Avemar) in the rat adjuvant arthritis (AA) model was examined. To Wistar rats with AA, different doses of FWGE and anti-inflammatory drugs (indomethacin, dexamethasone) as monotherapies were administered and FWGE and either diclofenac or dexamethasone were also given in combination. Besides plethysmographies of the paws, histological investigations of synovial tissues were also performed along with detection of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. Gene expressions of COX-1 and 2 were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). FWGE monotherapy significantly inhibited the development of the secondary (immune-mediated) response in AA, and dexamethasone and indomethacin exerted inhibitory effects in a degree comparable to that of FWGE. Histological analysis of the affected joints confirmed the results. FWGE inhibited COX-1 and -2, while indomethacin enhanced COX-2 gene expressions. FWGE had an additive interaction with diclofenac. It is concluded that FWGE has significant anti-inflammatory efficacy confirmed by plethysmography, histology, and real-time PCR."
"17977144","articletitle","Stability of Barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing in barley."
"17977144","abstracttext","Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) can be used as a powerful tool for functional genomics studies in plants. With this approach, it is possible to target most genes and downregulate the messenger (m)RNA in a sequence-specific manner. Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) is an established VIGS vector for barley and wheat; however, silencing using this vector is generally transient, with efficient silencing often being confined to the first two or three systemically infected leaves. To investigate this further, part of the barley Phytoene desaturase (PDS) gene was inserted into BSMV and the resulting photobleaching in infected barley plants was used as a reporter for silencing. In addition, downregulation of PDS mRNA was measured by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Using fragments of PDS ranging from 128 to 584 nucleotides in BSMV, we observed that insert length influenced stability but not efficiency of VIGS. Silencing was transient in most cases; however, the decrease in PDS mRNA levels measured by qRT-PCR began earlier and lasted longer than the photobleaching. Occasionally, silencing persisted and could be transmitted through seed as well as via mechanical inoculation, although large parts of the insert had been lost from the virus vector. The instability of the insert, observed consistently throughout our experiments, offers an explanation for the transient nature of silencing when using BSMV as a VIGS vector."

"16665020","abstracttext","The developmental accumulation pattern of messenger RNA transcripts and polypeptides for wheat gliadins and ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase was determined using cDNA and antibody probes. Gliadin mRNA was detected on Northern and RNA dot blots at 3 days after flowering, it increased 100-fold by 10 days and decreased subsequent to 14 days. The abundant mRNAs encoding alpha/beta- and gamma-type gliadins and mRNA for ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase, a key regulatory enzyme of starch biosynthesis, accumulated coordinately. Despite the coordinate accumulation of their mRNA transcripts, the accumulation of gliadin and ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase polypeptides, as determined by Western blot, differed significantly. The time at which gliadin and ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase mRNAs began accumulating was also the time when the overall pattern of gene expression, as seen by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of in vitro translation products, changed most significantly. However, the accumulation of a number of other mRNAs or polypeptides having unknown function occurred at other times during endosperm development. The pattern of expression in the earliest stages of development was strikingly similar to that of coleoptile, another rapidly growing, nonphotosynthetic tissue. Thus, the pattern of gene expression reflects the program of development observed cytologically."

"16668202","abstracttext","We show that the control of gene expression at the level of elongation and termination of protein synthesis can be observed in vitro. Free cytoplasmic polyribosomes were isolated from maize (Zea mays) root tips, and translated in root tip extracts that had been fractionated with ammonium sulfate to contain elongation factors, and be depleted in initiation factors. The root tip extract performs elongation and termination reactions as efficiently as wheat germ extracts. The translation products of the maize system are the same as made in vivo. The dependence of these in vitro elongation and termination reactions on pH was determined. Total protein synthesis in this system exhibits an optimum at pH approximately 7.5. However, the pH dependence of rates of synthesis of individual proteins is not at all uniform; many polyribosomes become stalled when translated at low pH. These data were compared with the elongation and termination capacity of polyribosomes isolated from oxygenated and hypoxic root tips (tissue having, respectively, high and low cytoplasmic pH values). We observed an inverse relationship between the relative abundance of many specific translatable mRNAs in polyribosomes of hypoxic root tips, and the relative rates of elongation and termination reactions on the different mRNAs at low pH in vitro. These results suggest that changes in intracellular pH in hypoxic root tips can be sensed directly by the translational machinery and thereby selectively modulate gene expression."

"16668683","abstracttext","We have investigated whether the precursors for the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding proteins (LHCP) of photosystems II and I (PSII and PSI) are cleavable substrates in an organelle-free reaction, and have compared the products with those obtained during in vitro import into chloroplasts. Representatives from the tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) LHCP family were analyzed. The precursor for LHCP type I of PSII (pLHCPII-1), encoded by the tomato gene Cab3C, was cleaved at only one site in the organelle-free assay, but two sites were recognized during import, analogous to our earlier results with a wheat precursor for LHCPII-1. The relative abundance of the two peptides produced was investigated during import of pLHCPII-1 into chloroplasts isolated from plants greened for 2 or 24 hours. In contrast to pLHCPII-1, the precursors for LHCP type II and III of PSI were cleaved in both assays, giving rise to a single peptide. The precursor for LHCP type I of PSI, encoded by gene Cab6A, yielded two peptides of 23.5 and 21.5 kilodaltons during import, whereas in the organelle-free assay only the 23.5 kilodalton peptide was found. N-terminal sequence analysis of this radiolabeled peptide has tentatively identified the site cleaved in the organelle-free assay between met40 and ser41 of the precursor."

"18776038","abstracttext","The fungus Stagonospora nodorum is a causal agent of leaf and glume blotch disease of wheat. It has been previously shown that inactivation of heterotrimeric G protein signaling in Stagonospora nodorum caused development defects and reduced pathogenicity [P. S. Solomon et al., Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 17:456-466, 2004]. In this study, we sought to identify targets of the signaling pathway that may have contributed to phenotypic defects of the signaling mutants. A comparative analysis of Stagonospora nodorum wild-type and Galpha-defective mutant (gna1) intracellular proteomes was performed via two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Several proteins showed significantly altered abundances when comparing the two strains. One such protein, the short-chain dehydrogenase Sch1, was 18-fold less abundant in the gna1 strain, implying that it is positively regulated by Galpha signaling. Gene expression and transcriptional enhanced green fluorescent protein fusion analyses of Sch1 indicates strong expression during asexual development. Mutant strains of Stagonospora nodorum lacking Sch1 demonstrated poor growth on minimal media and exhibited a significant reduction in asexual sporulation on all growth media examined. Detailed histological experiments on sch1 pycnidia revealed that the gene is required for the differentiation of the subparietal layers of asexual pycnidia resulting in a significant reduction in both pycnidiospore size and numbers."
"18655071","articletitle","Comparative proteomic and transcriptional profiling of a bread wheat cultivar and its derived transgenic line overexpressing a low molecular weight glutenin subunit gene in the endosperm."
"18655071","abstracttext","We carried out a parallel transcriptional and proteomic comparison of seeds from a transformed bread wheat line that overexpresses a transgenic low molecular weight glutenin subunit gene relative to the corresponding nontransformed genotype. Proteomic analyses showed that, during seed development, several classes of endosperm proteins were differentially accumulated in the transformed endosperm. As a result of the strong increase in the amount of the transgenic protein, the endogenous glutenin subunit, all subclasses of gliadins, and metabolic as well as chloroform/methanol soluble proteins were diminished in the transgenic genotype. The differential accumulation detected by proteomic analyses, both in mature and developing seeds, was paralleled by the corresponding changes in transcript levels detected by microarray experiments. Our results suggest that the most evident effect of the strong overexpression of the transgenic glutenin gene consists in a global compensatory response involving a significant decrease in the amounts of polypeptides belonging to the prolamin superfamily. It is likely that such compensation is a consequence of the diversion of amino acid reserves and translation machinery to the synthesis of the transgenic glutenin subunit."

Here we report the synthesis and in vitro biological testing of eleven BAP derivatives substituted in the benzyl ring and in the C2, N7 and N9 positions of the purine moiety. The ability of the compounds to interact with Arabidopsis cytokinin receptors AHK3 and CRE1/AHK4 was tested in bacterial receptor and in live-cell binding assays, and in an Arabidopsis ARR5:GUS (Arabidopsis response regulator 5) reporter gene assay. Cytokinin activity of the compounds was determined in classical cytokinin biotests (tobacco callus, wheat leaf senescence and Amaranthus bioassays). 6-(2,5-Dihydroxybenzylamino)purine (LGR-991) was identified as a cytokinin receptor antagonist. At the molecular level LGR-991 blocks the cytokinin receptor CRE1/AHK4 with the same potency as PI-55. Moreover, LGR-991 acts as a competitive inhibitor of AHK3, and importantly shows reduced agonistic effects in comparison to PI-55 in the ARR5:GUS reporter gene assay and in cytokinin bioassays. LGR-991 causes more rapid germination of Arabidopsis seeds and increases hypocotyl length of dark-grown seedlings, which are characteristics of plants with a reduced cytokinin status. LGR-991 exhibits a structural motive that might lead to preparation of cytokinin antagonists with a broader specificity and reduced agonistic properties."

"20581179","abstracttext","The lactic acid bacterial (LAB) community dynamics of two wheat and two spelt sourdough fermentations that were daily back-slopped were monitored during a period of 10 days by hybridizing time-related RNA samples, representing the metatranscriptome, to an LAB functional gene microarray. To indicate the species present in each hybridized sample, annotation information for the 2,269 oligonucleotides on the microarray was used. The overall hybridization data revealed that after a transition phase of 5 days, in which atypical sourdough LAB species, including Enterococcus species, were found, a stabilized ecosystem was established with Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus fermentum as the dominating LAB species. Compared with the combined outcome of culture-dependent and culture-independent identification techniques, the microarray data revealed a functional role for Lactococcus lactis in the early stage ecosystem and the dominance of Pediococcus pentosaceus in most of the fermentations, besides L. plantarum and L. fermentum. Consequently, metatranscriptome hybridization data obtained using an LAB functional gene microarray was shown to be an interesting alternative to microbiological analysis of the community dynamics of complex food ecosystems."
"20610411","articletitle","Accidental amplification and inactivation of a methyltransferase gene eliminates cytosine methylation in Mycosphaerella graminicola."
"20610411","abstracttext","A de novo search for repetitive elements in the genome sequence of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola identified a family of repeats containing a DNA cytosine methyltransferase sequence (MgDNMT). All 23 MgDNMT sequences identified carried signatures of repeat induced point mutation (RIP). All copies were subtelomeric in location except for one on chromosome 6. Synteny with M. fijiensis implied that the nontelomeric copy on chromosome 6 served as a template for subsequent amplifications. Southern analysis revealed that the MgDNMT sequence also was amplified in 15 additional M. graminicola isolates from various geographical regions. However, this amplification event was specific to M. graminicola; a search for MgDNMT homologs identified only a single, unmutated copy in the genomes of 11 other ascomycetes. A genome-wide methylation assay revealed that M. graminicola lacks cytosine methylation, as expected if its MgDNMT gene is inactivated. Methylation was present in several other species tested, including the closest known relatives of M. graminicola, species S1 and S2. Therefore, the observed changes most likely occurred within the past 10,500 years since the divergence between M. graminicola and S1. Our data indicate that the recent amplification of a single-copy MgDNMT gene made it susceptible to RIP, resulting in complete loss of cytosine methylation in M. graminicola."

"20176888","abstracttext","Members of the ALMT gene family contribute to the Al(3+) resistance of several plant species by facilitating malate efflux from root cells. The first member of this family to be cloned and characterized, TaALMT1, is responsible for most of the natural variation of Al(3+) resistance in wheat. The current study describes the isolation and characterization of HvALMT1, the barley gene with the greatest sequence similarity to TaALMT1. HvALMT1 is located on chromosome 2H which has not been associated with Al(3+) resistance in barley. The relatively low levels of HvALMT1 expression detected in root and shoot tissues were independent of external aluminium or phosphorus supply. Transgenic barley plants transformed with the HvALMT1 promoter fused to the green fluorescent protein (GFP) indicated that expression of HvALMT1 was relatively high in stomatal guard cells and in root tissues containing expanding cells. GFP fused to the C-terminus of the full HvALMT1 protein localized to the plasma membrane and motile vesicles within the cytoplasm. HvALMT1 conferred both inward and outward currents when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes that were bathed in a range of anions including malate. Both malate uptake and efflux were confirmed in oocyte assays using [(14)C]malate as a radiotracer. It is suggested that HvALMT1 functions as an anion channel to facilitate organic anion transport in stomatal function and expanding cells."

"20384785","abstracttext","Sourdough fermentations are characterized by the combined activity of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. An investigation of the microbial composition of 21 artisan sourdoughs from 11 different Belgian bakeries yielded 127 yeast isolates. Also, 12 spontaneous 10-day laboratory sourdough fermentations with daily backslopping were performed with rye, wheat, and spelt flour, resulting in the isolation of 217 yeast colonies. The isolates were grouped according to PCR-fingerprints obtained with the primer M13. Representative isolates of each M13 fingerprint group were identified using the D1/D2 region of the large subunit rRNA gene, internal transcribed spacer sequences, and partial actin gene sequences, leading to the detection of six species. The dominant species in the bakery sourdoughs were Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Wickerhamomyces anomalus (formerly Pichia anomala), while the dominant species in the laboratory sourdough fermentations were W. anomalus and Candida glabrata. The presence of S. cerevisiae in the bakery sourdoughs might be due to contamination of the bakery environment with commercial bakers yeast, while the yeasts in the laboratory sourdoughs, which were carried out under aseptic conditions with flour as the only nonsterile component, could only have come from the flour used."

Pseudomonas fluorescens ATCC 13525, transformed with pAB3 plasmid containing the ppc gene showed a 14-fold increase in PPC activity under P-sufficiency resulting in increased carbon flow through the direct oxidative pathway and reduced metabolic overflow. Under P-limitation, contribution of the direct oxidative pathway significantly increased in P. fluorescens ATCC 13525; however, ppc overexpression enhanced glucose catabolism through intracellular phosphorylative pathway. These results correlated with gluconic, pyruvic and acetic acid levels as well as the activities of key glucose catabolic enzymes. Irrespective of the P-status, ppc overexpression improved biomass yield without altering growth rate, resulting in improved P- solubilizing abilities of P. fluorescens ATCC 13525 as well as of the wheat rhizosphere fluorescent pseudomonads isolates Fp585, P109 and Fp315. Collectively, ppc overexpression reversed the P-status dependent glucose distribution between the direct oxidative and phosphorylative pathways of glucose catabolism in P. fluorescens ATCC 13525 and presents a feasible genetic engineering approach for developing efficient P-solubilizing bacteria."

"19594311","abstracttext","Sugar beet in Europe is commonly grown in wheat and maize crop rotations and subsequently pile-stored for several weeks. Beet is threatened by the colonization of saprophytic as well as pathogenic Fusarium spp. A tool for reliable identification based on sequence information of the translation elongation factor 1alpha (TEF-1alpha) gene was developed for the numerous Fusarium spp. being isolated from sugar beets. In all, 65 isolates from different species (Fusarium avenaceum, F. cerealis, F. culmorum, F. equiseti, F. graminearum, F. oxysporum, F. proliferatum, F. redolens, F. solani, F. tricinctum, and F. venenatum) were obtained from sugar beet at different developmental stages from locations worldwide. Database sequences for additional species (F. sporotrichioides, F. poae, F. torulosum, F. hostae, F. sambucinum, F. subglutinans, and F. verticillioides), isolated from sugar beets in previous studies, were included in the analysis. Molecular sequence analysis of the partial TEF-1alpha gene fragment revealed sufficient variability to differentiate between the Fusarium spp., resulting in species-dependent separation of the isolates analyzed. This interspecific divergence could be translated into a polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism assay using only two subsequent restriction digests for the differentiation of 17 of 18 species."

The deduced amino acid sequence was highly homologous with the alpha-L-arabinofuranosidases belonging to family 51 of the glycoside hydrolases. The recombinant protein was purified to electrophoretic homogeneity by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and subsequently characterized. The optimal pH and temperature for the recombinant enzyme were 6.0 and 60 approximately 65 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme showed a broad pH range of stability, retaining over 75% of the maximum activity at pH 5.0 to 11.0. The specific activity, K (m), and V (max) with p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside as substrate were 60.0 U mg(-1), 1.45 mM, and 221 mumol min(-1) mg(-1), respectively.

These favorable properties make Abf51S9 a good candidate in various industrial applications."
"19874543","articletitle","Transformation of the flax rust fungus, Melampsora lini: selection via silencing of an avirulence gene."
"19874543","abstracttext","Rust fungi cause devastating diseases on many important food crops, with a damaging stem rust epidemic currently affecting wheat production in Africa and the Middle East. These parasitic fungi propagate exclusively on plants, precluding the use of many biotechnological tools available for other culturable fungi. In particular the lack of a stable transformation system has been an impediment to the genetic manipulation required for molecular analysis of rust pathogenicity. We have developed an Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation procedure for the model flax rust fungus Melampsora lini, which infects flax (Linum usitatissimum). Selection of transgenic rust lines is based on silencing of AvrL567, which encodes a rust effector protein that is recognised by the flax L6 immune receptor. The non-transgenic rust line is unable to infect flax plants expressing L6, while silenced transgenic lines are virulent on these plants, providing an effective selection system. This directly confirms that the cloned AvrL567 gene is responsible for flax rust virulence phenotypes, and demonstrates the utility of this system to probe rust gene function."

"19706486","abstracttext","Paleogenomics seeks to reconstruct ancestral genomes from the genes of today's species. The characterization of paleo-duplications represented by 11,737 orthologs and 4,382 paralogs identified in five species belonging to three of the agronomically most important subfamilies of grasses, that is, Ehrhartoideae (rice) Panicoideae (sorghum, maize), and Pooideae (wheat, barley), permitted us to propose a model for an ancestral genome with a minimal size of 33.6 Mb structured in five proto-chromosomes containing at least 9,138 predicted proto-genes. It appears that only four major evolutionary shuffling events (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta) explain the divergence of these five cereal genomes during their evolution from a common paleo-ancestor. Comparative analysis of ancestral gene function with rice as a reference indicated that five categories of genes were preferentially modified during evolution. Furthermore, alignments between the five grass proto-chromosomes and the recently identified seven eudicot proto-chromosomes indicated that additional very active episodes of genome rearrangements and gene mobility occurred during angiosperm evolution. If one compares the pace of primate evolution of 90 million years (233 species) to 60 million years of the Poaceae (10,000 species), change in chromosome structure through speciation has accelerated significantly in plants."
"21831136","articletitle","Identification, characterization and interpretation of single-nucleotide sequence variation in allopolyploid crop species."
"21831136","abstracttext","An understanding of nature and extent of nucleotide sequence variation is required for programmes of discovery and characterization of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which provide the most versatile class of molecular genetic marker. A majority of higher plant species are polyploids, and allopolyploidy, because of hybrid formation between closely related taxa, is very common. Mutational variation may arise both between allelic (homologous) sequences within individual subgenomes and between homoeologous sequences among subgenomes, in addition to paralogous variation between duplicated gene copies. Successful SNP validation in allopolyploids depends on differentiation of the sequence variation classes. A number of biological factors influence the feasibility of discrimination, including degree of gene family complexity, inbreeding or outbreeding reproductive habit, and the level of knowledge concerning progenitor diploid species. In addition, developments in high-throughput DNA sequencing and associated computational analysis provide general solutions for the genetic analysis of allopolyploids. These issues are explored in the context of experience from a range of allopolyploid species, representing grain (wheat and canola), forage (pasture legumes and grasses), and horticultural (strawberry) crop. Following SNP discovery, detection in routine genotyping applications also presents challenges for allopolyploids. Strategies based on either design of subgenome-specific SNP assays through homoeolocus-targeted polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, or detection of incremental changes in nucleotide variant dosage, are described."

Coliform bacteria were not detected during fermentation, while LAB and yeasts were in the range 10(7)-10(8) colony forming units (CFU) g(-1). Plate counts showed an optimal development of both fermenting microbial groups and the differences in cell concentrations were not significant (P > 0.05). LAB were isolated during fermentation and grouped on the basis of phenotypic and polymorphic characteristics. LAB isolates were identified by a combined genetic approach consisting of 16S/23S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ITS) and partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing as Pediococcus acidilactici, Lactobacillus plantarum and Lactobacillus brevis. Hence, the pasteurisation of the vegetable ingredients, excluded wheat flour, enhanced the hygienic conditions of tarhana without influencing the normal evolution of LAB. However, the fermentation at 40 °C favoured pediococci, while the production at 30 °C was mainly characterised by lactobacilli. Yeasts, identified by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of the 5.8S ITS rRNA gene, were mainly represented by the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae in both productions."

"21779350","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is an obligate biotrophic fungus that causes the destructive wheat stripe rust disease worldwide. Due to the lack of reliable transformation and gene disruption method, knowledge about the function of Pst genes involved in pathogenesis is limited. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) genes have been shown in a number of plant pathogenic fungi to play critical roles in regulating various infection processes. In the present study, we identified and characterized the first MAPK gene PsMAPK1 in Pst. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that PsMAPK1 is a YERK1 MAP kinase belonging to the Fus3/Kss1 class. Single nucleotide polymerphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletion were detected in the coding region of PsMAPK1 among six Pst isolates. Real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that PsMAPK1 expression was induced at early infection stages and peaked during haustorium formation. When expressed in Fusarium graminearum, PsMAPK1 partially rescued the map1 mutant in vegetative growth and pathogenicity. It also partially complemented the defects of the Magnaporthe oryzae pmk1 mutant in appressorium formation and plant infection. These results suggest that F. graminearum and M. oryzae can be used as surrogate systems for functional analysis of well-conserved Pst genes and PsMAPK1 may play a role in the regulation of plant penetration and infectious growth in Pst."

"21862481","abstracttext","Jacalin-related lectins (JRLs) are a subgroup of proteins with one or more jacalin-like lectin domains. Although JRLs are often associated with biotic or abiotic stimuli, their biological functions in plants, as well as their relationships to plant disease resistance, are poorly understood. A mannose-specific JRL (mJRL)-like gene (TaJRLL1) that is mainly expressed in stem and spike and encodes a protein with two jacalin-like lectin domains was identified in wheat. Pathogen infection and phytohormone treatments induced its expression; while application of the salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis inhibitor paclobutrazol and the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis inhibitor diethyldithiocarbamic acid, respectively, substantially inhibited its expression. Attenuating TaJRLL1 through virus-induced gene silencing increased susceptibility to the facultative fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum and the biotrophic fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis. Arabidopsis thaliana transformed with TaJRLL1 displayed increased resistance to F. graminearum and Botrytis cinerea. JA and SA levels in transgenic Arabidopsis increased significantly. A loss or increase of disease resistance due to an alteration in TaJRLL1 function was correlated with attenuation or enhancement of the SA- and JA-dependent defence signalling pathways. These results suggest that TaJRLL1 could be a component of the SA- and JA-dependent defence signalling pathways."

"21876378","abstracttext","A xylanase gene, xyn7c, was cloned from Paenibacillus sp. 12-11, an alkalophilic strain isolated from the alkaline wastewater sludge of a paper mill, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The full-length gene consists of 1,296 bp and encodes a mature protein of 400 residues (excluding the putative signal peptide) that belongs to the glycoside hydrolase family 10. The optimal pH of the purified recombinant XYN7C was found to be 8.0, and the enzyme had good pH adaptability at 6.5-8.5 and stability over a broad pH range of 5.0-11.0. XYN7C exhibited maximum activity at 55 degrees C and was thermostable at 50 degrees C and below. Using wheat arabinoxylan as the substrate, XYN7C had a high specific activity of 1,886 U/mg, and the apparent Km and Vmax values were 1.18 mg/ml and 1,961 μmol/mg/min, respectively. XYN7C also had substrate specificity towards various xylans, and was highly resistant to neutral proteases. The main hydrolysis products of xylans were xylose and xylobiose. These properties make XYN7C a promising candidate to be used in biobleaching, baking, and cotton scouring processes."

"22713714","abstracttext","The velvet complex containing VeA, VelB and LaeA has been showed to play critical roles in the regulation of secondary metabolism and diverse cellular processes in Aspergillus spp. In this study, we identified FgVelB, a homolog of Aspergillus nidulans VelB, from Fusarium graminearum using the BLASTP program. Disruption of FgVELB gene led to several phenotypic defects, including suppression of aerial hyphae formation, reduced hyphal hydrophobicity and highly increased conidiation. The mutant showed increased resistance to osmotic stress and cell wall-damaging agents, which may be related to a high level of glycerol accumulation in the mutant. Additionally, the mutant exhibited increased sensitivity to the phenylpyrrole fungicide fludioxonil. Ultrastructural and histochemical analyses revealed that conidia of FgVELB deletion mutant contained numerous lipid droplets. Pathogenicity assays showed FgVELB deletion mutant was impaired in virulence on flowering wheat head, which is consistent with the observation that FgVelB is involved in the regulation of deoxynivalenol biosynthesis in F. graminearum. All of the defects were restored by genetic complementation of the mutant with wild-type FgVELB gene. Yeast two hybrid assays showed that FgVelB does not interact with FgVeA. Taken together, results of this study indicated that FgVelB plays a critical role in the regulation of various cellular processes in F. graminearum."

"23543108","abstracttext","American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was transformed with a wheat oxalate oxidase (oxo) gene in an effort to degrade the oxalic acid (OA) secreted by the fungus Cryphonectria parasitica, thus decreasing its virulence. Expression of OxO was examined under two promoters: a strong constitutive promoter, CaMV 35S, and a predominantly vascular promoter, VspB. Oxo gene transcription was quantified by RT-qPCR. Relative expression of OxO varied approximately 200 fold among events produced with the 35S-OxO. The lowest 35S-OxO event expressed approximately 3,000 fold higher than the highest VspB-OxO event. This was potentially due to the tissue-specific nature of the VspB-controlled expression, the strength of the CaMV 35S constitutive promoter, or position effects. Leaf assays measuring necrotic lesion length were conducted to better understand the relationship between OxO expression level and the blight fungus in planta. A threshold response was observed between the OxO expression level and the C. parasitica lesion length. Five events of the 35S-OxO line showed significantly reduced lesion length compared to the blight-susceptible American chestnut. More importantly, the lesion length in these five events was reduced to the same level as the blight-resistant Chinese chestnut, C. mollissima. This is the first report on enhanced pathogen resistance in transgenic American chestnut."

"22943368","abstracttext","CN17 is a functional stay-green wheat variety that exhibits delayed leaf senescence and enhanced photosynthetic competence. To better understand these valuable traits, levels of chlorophyll a and b, soluble proteins, unsaturated fatty acids, and other components of CN17 were assayed. In addition, chloroplast ultrastructure, chloroplast number, and differences in gene expression between CN17 and a control variety, MY11, were examined. By 21 d post-anthesis (DPA), CN17 leaves exhibited a significantly higher maximal photochemical efficiency for photosystem II (PSII) (F(v) /F(m) ) and a significantly higher efficiency of excitation capture by open PSII reaction centres (F(v) '/F(m) '). In addition, chlorophyll degradation in CN17 was delayed by approximately 14 d, and was not blocked as observed in cosmetic stay-green phenotypes. The soluble protein content (Ps) of CN17 was higher than MY11 at all timepoints assayed, and the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids was significantly higher. CN17 also exhibited isolated granal lamellae associated with vesicles and diminished peroxidation, and between 35 and 42 DPA, a sharp decrease in chloroplast number was detected. Taken together, these results strongly support the hypothesis that chloroplast ultrastructure regeneration is responsible for the functional stay-green trait of CN17, and gene expression data provide insight into the mechanistic details."

"22897438","abstracttext","High-throughput methods are needed for functional genomics analysis in Fusarium culmorum, the cause of crown and foot rot on wheat and a type B trichothecene producer. Our aim was to develop and test the efficacy of a double-component system based on the ability of the impala transposase to transactivate the miniature inverted-repeat transposable element mimp1 of Fusarium oxysporum. We report, for the first time, the application of a tagging system based on a heterologous transposon and of splinkerette-polymerase chain reaction to identify mimp1 flanking regions in the filamentous fungus F. culmorum. Similar to previous observations in Fusarium graminearum, mimp1 transposes in F. culmorum by a cut-and-paste mechanism into TA dinucleotides, which are duplicated on insertion. mimp1 was reinserted in open reading frames in 16.4% (i.e. 10 of 61) of the strains analysed, probably spanning throughout the entire genome of F. culmorum. The effectiveness of the mimp1/impala double-component system for gene tagging in F. culmorum was confirmed phenotypically for a putative aurofusarin gene. This system also allowed the identification of two genes putatively involved in oxidative stress-coping capabilities in F. culmorum, as well as a sequence specific to this fungus, thus suggesting the valuable exploratory role of this tool."
"22859676","articletitle","Genomic asymmetry in allopolyploid plants: wheat as a model."
"22859676","abstracttext","The evolvement of duplicated gene loci in allopolyploid plants has become the subject of intensive studies. Most duplicated genes remain active in neoallopolyploids contributing either to a favourable effect of an extra gene dosage or to the build-up of positive inter-genomic interactions when genes or regulation factors on homoeologous chromosomes are divergent. However, in a small number of loci (about 10%), genes of only one genome are active, while the homoeoalleles on the other genome(s) are either eliminated or partially or completely suppressed by genetic or epigenetic means. For several traits, the retention of controlling genes is not random, favouring one genome over the other(s). Such genomic asymmetry is manifested in allopolyploid wheat by the control of various morphological and agronomical traits, in the production of rRNA and storage proteins, and in interaction with pathogens. It is suggested that the process of cytological diploidization leading to exclusive intra-genomic meiotic pairing and, consequently, to complete avoidance of inter-genomic recombination, has two contrasting effects. Firstly, it provides a means for the fixation of positive heterotic inter-genomic interactions and also maintains genomic asymmetry resulting from loss or silencing of genes. The possible mechanisms and evolutionary advantages of genomic asymmetry are discussed."

"20696001","abstracttext","The initial stages of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (the causal agent of yellow rust in wheat) infection triggered a hypersensitive cell death (HCD) response in both compatible and Yr1-mediated incompatible interactions, although the response was earlier and more extensive in the incompatible interaction. Later stages of fungal development were only associated with an HCD response in the incompatible interaction, the HCD response being effectively suppressed in the compatible interaction. Cell autofluorescence was seen in mesophyll cells in direct contact with fungal infection hyphae (primary HCD) and in adjacent mesophyll cells (secondary HCD), indicating the activation of cell-to-cell signalling. Microarray analysis identified a number of defence-related transcripts implicated in Yr1-mediated resistance, including classical pathogenesis-related (PR) transcripts and genes involved in plant cell defence responses, such as the oxidative burst and cell wall fortification. A quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction time course analysis identified a number of defence-related genes, including PR2, PR4, PR9, PR10 and WIR1 transcripts, associated with the latter stages of Yr1-mediated resistance. A meta-analysis comparison of the Yr1-regulated transcriptome with the resistance transcriptomes of the race-specific resistance gene Yr5 and the race-nonspecific adult plant resistance gene Yr39 indicated limited transcript commonality. Common transcripts were largely confined to classic PR and defence-related genes."
"20698755","articletitle","Plant height affects Fusarium crown rot severity in wheat."
"20698755","abstracttext","Effects of plant height on Fusarium crown rot (FCR) disease severity were investigated using 12 pairs of near-isogenic lines (NILs) for six different reduced height (Rht) genes in wheat. The dwarf isolines all gave better FCR resistance when compared with their respective tall counterparts, although the Rht genes involved in these NILs are located on several different chromosomes. Treating plants with exogenous gibberellin increased FCR severity as well as seedling lengths in all of the isolines tested. Analysis of the expression of several defense genes with known correlation with resistance to FCR pathogens between the Rht isolines following FCR inoculation indicated that the better resistance of the dwarf isolines was not due to enhanced defense gene induction. These results suggested that the difference in FCR severity between the tall and dwarf isolines is likely due to their height difference per se or to some physiological and structural consequences of reduced height. Thus, caution should be taken when considering to exploit any FCR locus located near a height gene."

"20683632","abstracttext","The recent release of the genome sequences of a number of crop and model plant species has made it possible to define the genome organisation and functional characteristics of specific genes and gene families of agronomic importance. For instance, Sorghum bicolor, maize (Zea mays) and Brachypodium distachyon genome sequences along with the model grass species rice (Oryza sativa) enable the comparative analysis of genes involved in plant defence. Germin-like proteins (GLPs) are a small, functionally and taxonomically diverse class of cupin-domain containing proteins that have recently been shown to cluster in an area of rice chromosome 8. The genomic location of this gene cluster overlaps with a disease resistance QTL that provides defence against two rice fungal pathogens (Magnaporthe oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani). Studies showing the involvement of GLPs in basal host resistance against powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis ssp.) have also been reported in barley and wheat. In this mini-review, we compare the close proximity of GLPs in publicly available cereal crop genomes and discuss the contribution that these proteins, and their genome sequence organisation, play in plant defence."
"21223323","articletitle","Horizontal gene and chromosome transfer in plant pathogenic fungi affecting host range."
"21223323","abstracttext","Plant pathogenic fungi adapt quickly to changing environments including overcoming plant disease resistance genes. This is usually achieved by mutations in single effector genes of the pathogens, enabling them to avoid recognition by the host plant. In addition, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and horizontal chromosome transfer (HCT) provide a means for pathogens to broaden their host range. Recently, several reports have appeared in the literature on HGT, HCT and hybridization between plant pathogenic fungi that affect their host range, including species of Stagonospora/Pyrenophora, Fusarium and Alternaria. Evidence is given that HGT of the ToxA gene from Stagonospora nodorum to Pyrenophora tritici-repentis enabled the latter fungus to cause a serious disease in wheat. A nonpathogenic Fusarium species can become pathogenic on tomato by HCT of a pathogenicity chromosome from Fusarium oxysporum f.sp lycopersici, a well-known pathogen of tomato. Similarly, Alternaria species can broaden their host range by HCT of a single chromosome carrying a cluster of genes encoding host-specific toxins that enabled them to become pathogenic on new hosts such as apple, Japanese pear, strawberry and tomato, respectively. The mechanisms HGT and HCT and their impact on potential emergence of fungal plant pathogens adapted to new host plants will be discussed."

"21224378","abstracttext","Riboswitches are RNA elements in mRNA that control gene expression in cis in response to their specific ligands. Because artificial riboswitches make it possible to regulate any gene with an arbitrary molecule, they are expected to function as biosensors, in which the output is easily detectable protein expression. I report herein a fully rational design strategy for artificially constructing novel riboswitches that work in a eukaryotic cell-free translation system (wheat germ extract). In these riboswitches, translation mediated by an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) is promoted only in the presence of a specific ligand (ON), while it is inhibited in the absence of the ligand (OFF). The first rationally designed riboswitch, which is regulated by theophylline, showed a high switching efficiency and dependency on theophylline. In addition, based on the design of the theophylline-dependent riboswitch, other three kinds of riboswitches controlled by FMN, tetracycline, and sulforhodamine B, were constructed only by calculating the ΔG value of one stem-loop structure. The rational design strategy described herein is therefore useful for easily producing various ligand-dependent riboswitches, which are available as biosensors for detecting their ligands."

"21295455","abstracttext","Triglyceride lipases catalyze the reversible degradation of glycerol esters with long-chain fatty acids into fatty acids and glycerol. In silico analysis of 5'-end flanking sequence of the gene LIP1 encoding a triglyceride lipase from the wheat head blight pathogen Fusarium graminearum revealed the presence of several cis-regulatory elements. To delineate the function of these regulatory elements, we constructed a series of deletion mutants in the LIP1 promoter region fused to the open reading frame of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) and assayed the promoter activity. Analysis of GFP expression levels in mutants indicated that a 563-bp promoter sequence was sufficient to drive the expression of LIP1 and regulatory elements responsible for the gene induction were located within the 563-372bp region. To further investigate the regulatory elements, putative cis-acting elements spanned within the 563-372bp region were mutated using a targeted mutagenesis approach. A CCAAT box, a CreA binding site, and a fatty acid responsive element (FARE) were identified and confirmed to be required for the basal expression of LIP1, glucose suppression and fatty acid induction, respectively."

"21535349","abstracttext","Response regulator (RR) proteins are core elements of the high-osmolarity glycerol (HOG) pathway, which plays an important role in the adaptation of fungi to a variety of environmental stresses. In this study, we constructed deletion mutants of two putative RR genes, FgRRG-1 and FgRRG-2, which are orthologues of Neurospora crassa RRG-1 and RRG-2, respectively. The FgRRG-1 deletion mutant (ΔFgRrg1-6) showed increased sensitivity to osmotic stress mediated by NaCl, KCl, sorbitol or glucose, and to metal cations Li(+) , Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) . The mutant, however, was more resistant than the parent isolate to dicarboximide and phenylpyrrole fungicides. Inoculation tests showed that the mutant exhibited decreased virulence on wheat heads. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction assays indicated that the expression of FgOS-2, the putative downstream gene of FgRRG-1, was decreased significantly in ΔFgRrg1-6. All of the defects were restored by genetic complementation of ΔFgRrg1-6 with the wild-type FgRRG-1 gene. Different from the FgRRG-1 deletion mutant, FgRRG-2 deletion mutants were morphologically indistinguishable from the wild-type progenitor in virulence and in sensitivity to the dicarboximide fungicide iprodione and osmotic stresses. These results indicate that the RR FgRrg-1 of F. graminearum is involved in the osmotic stress response, pathogenicity and sensitivity to dicarboximide and phenylpyrrole fungicides and metal cations."

For each TF, sequence features, promoter regions, domain alignments, GO assignment, FL-cDNA information, if available, and cross-references to various public databases and genetic resources are provided. Additionally, GramineaeTFDB possesses a tool which aids the users to search for putative cis-elements located in the promoter regions of TFs and predict the functions of the TFs using cis-element-based functional prediction approach. We also supplied hyperlinks to expression profiles of those TF genes of maize, rice, and barley, for which data are available. Furthermore, information about the availability of FOX and Ds mutant lines for rice and maize TFs, respectively, are also accessible through hyperlinks. Our study provides an important user-friendly public resource for functional analyses and comparative genomics of grass TFs, and understanding of the architecture of transcriptional regulatory networks and evolution of the TFs in agriculturally important cereal crops."

"23124957","abstracttext","The sense of taste plays a pivotal role in the food-selecting behaviors of vertebrates. We have shown that the fish ortholog of the phospholipase C gene (plc-β2) is expressed in a subpopulation of taste bud cells that transmit taste stimuli to the central nervous system to evoke favorable and aversive behaviors. We generated transgenic medaka expressing wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) under the control of a regulatory region of the medaka plc-β2 gene to analyze the neuronal circuit connected to these sensory cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of the transgenic fish 12 days post fertilization revealed that the WGA protein was transferred to cranial sensory ganglia and several nuclei in the hindbrain. WGA signals were also detected in the secondary gustatory nucleus in the hindbrain of 3-month-old transgenic fish. WGA signals were observed in several diencephalic and telencephalic regions in 9-month-old transgenic fish. The age-dependent increase in the labeled brain regions strongly suggests that labeling occurred at taste bud cells and progressively extended to cranial nerves and neurons in the central nervous system. These data are the first to demonstrate the tracing of higher order gustatory neuronal circuitry that is associated with a specific subpopulation of taste bud cells. These results provide insight into the basic neuronal architecture of gustatory information processing that is common among vertebrates."

"22442306","abstracttext","R-type and F-type pyocins are high-molecular-mass bacteriocins produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that resemble bacteriophage tails. They contain no head structures and no DNA, and are used as defence systems. In this report, we show that Pseudomonas fluorescens SF4c, a strain isolated from the wheat rhizosphere, produces a high-molecular-mass bacteriocin which inhibits the growth of closely related bacteria. A mutant deficient in production of this antimicrobial compound was obtained by transposon mutagenesis. Sequence analysis revealed that the transposon had disrupted a gene that we have named ptm, since it is homologous to that encoding phage tape-measure protein in P. fluorescens Pf0-1, a gene belonging to a prophage similar to phage-like pyocin from P. aeruginosa PAO1. In addition, we have identified genes from the SF4c pyocin cluster that encode a lytic system and regulatory genes. We constructed a non-polar ptm mutant of P. fluorescens SF4c. Heterologous complementation of this mutation restored the production of bacteriocin. Real-time PCR was used to analyse the expression of pyocin under different stress conditions. Bacteriocin was upregulated by mitomycin C, UV light and hydrogen peroxide, and was downregulated by saline stress. This report constitutes, to our knowledge, the first genetic characterization of a phage tail-like bacteriocin in a rhizosphere Pseudomonas strain."

In this work, the full-length cDNA of a novel CIPK gene (TaCIPK14) was isolated from wheat and was found to have significant sequence similarity to OsCIPK14/15. Subcellular localization assay revealed the presence of TaCIPK14 throughout the cell. qRT-PCR analysis showed that TaCIPK14 was upregulated under cold conditions or when treated with salt, PEG or exogenous stresses related signaling molecules including ABA, ethylene and H2 O2 . Transgenic tobaccos overexpressing TaCIPK14 exhibited higher contents of chlorophyll and sugar, higher catalase activity, while decreased amounts of H2 O2 and malondialdehyde, and lesser ion leakage under cold and salt stresses. In addition, overexpression also increased seed germination rate, root elongation and decreased Na(+) content in the transgenic lines under salt stress. Higher expression of stress-related genes was observed in lines overexpressing TaCIPK14 compared to controls under stress conditions. In summary, these results suggested that TaCIPK14 is an abiotic stress-responsive gene in plants."

Isolation of fluorescent Pseudomonas species was carried out from the soil samples collected. The percentage of isolates positive for indolic compound, P-solubilisation, siderophore production and ACC deaminase activity were 64.0, 38.6, 63.5, and 19.7, respectively. A total of 543 isolates were randomly selected for studies based on the genus specific confirmation by the Pseudomonas specific primer. Among the 543 isolates, 26 different clusters were formed from 16S rDNA-RFLP whereas 27 clusters were generated by the rpoB-RFLP with similarity percent ranging from 3 to 100%. 16S rDNA sequencing showed 9 different species of Pseudomonas whereas, rpoB sequencing showed 13 different species of Pseudomonas. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rDNA gene sequences generated 15 branches showing the more than 70% of boot strap value, whereas 18 branches in the rpoB based phylogenetic tree were supported by bootstrap values above 70%.

"23766524","abstracttext","Grass inflorescence and stem branches show recognizable architectural differences among species. The inflorescence branches of Triticeae cereals and grasses, including wheat, barley, and 400-500 wild species, are usually contracted into a spike formation, with the number of flowering branches (spikelets) per node conserved within species and genera. Perennial Triticeae grasses of genus Leymus are unusual in that the number of spikelets per node varies, inflorescences may have panicle branches, and vegetative stems may form subterranean rhizomes. Leymus cinereus and L. triticoides show discrete differences in inflorescence length, branching architecture, node number, and density; number of spikelets per node and florets per spikelet; culm length and width; and perimeter of rhizomatous spreading. Quantitative trait loci controlling these traits were detected in 2 pseudo-backcross populations derived from the interspecific hybrids using a linkage map with 360 expressed gene sequence markers from Leymus tiller and rhizome branch meristems. Alignments of genes, mutations, and quantitative trait loci controlling similar traits in other grass species were identified using the Brachypodium genome reference sequence. Evidence suggests that loci controlling inflorescence and stem branch architecture in Leymus are conserved among the grasses, are governed by natural selection, and can serve as possible gene targets for improving seed, forage, and grain production."
"24777609","articletitle","The transcriptional network of WRKY53 in cereals links oxidative responses to biotic and abiotic stress inputs."
"24777609","abstracttext","The transcription factor WRKY53 is expressed during biotic and abiotic stress responses in cereals, but little is currently known about its regulation, structure and downstream targets. We sequenced the wheat ortholog TaWRKY53 and its promoter region, which revealed extensive similarity in gene architecture and cis-acting regulatory elements to the rice ortholog OsWRKY53, including the presence of stress-responsive abscisic acid-responsive elements (ABRE) motifs and GCC-boxes. Four proteins interacted with the WRKY53 promoter in yeast one-hybrid assays, suggesting that this gene can receive inputs from diverse stress-related pathways such as calcium signalling and senescence, and environmental cues such as drought and ultraviolet radiation. The Ser/Thr receptor kinase ORK10/LRK10 and the apoplastic peroxidase POC1 are two downstream targets for regulation by the WRKY53 transcription factor, predicted based on the presence of W-box motifs in their promoters and coregulation with WRKY53, and verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Both ORK10/LRK10 and POC1 are upregulated during cereal responses to pathogens and aphids and important components of the oxidative burst during the hypersensitive response. Taken with our yeast two-hybrid assay which identified a strong protein-protein interaction between microsomal glutathione S-transferase 3 and WRKY53, this implies that the WRKY53 transcriptional network regulates oxidative responses to a wide array of stresses."

"24657475","abstracttext","Agrocybe praecox is a litter-decomposing Basidiomycota species of the order Agaricales, and is frequently found in forests and open woodlands. A. praecox grows in leaf-litter and the upper soil and is able to colonize bark mulch and wood chips. It produces extracellular manganese peroxidase (MnP) activities and mineralizes synthetic lignin. In this study, the A. praecox MnP1 isozyme was purified, cloned and enzymatically characterized. The enzyme catalysed the oxidation of Mn(2+) to Mn(3+), which is the specific reaction for manganese-dependent class II heme-peroxidases, in the presence of malonate as chelator with an activity maximum at pH 4.5; detectable activity was observed even at pH 7.0. The coding sequence of the mnp1 gene demonstrates a short-type of MnP protein with a slightly modified Mn(2+) binding site. Thus, A. praecox MnP1 may represent a novel group of atypical short-MnP enzymes. In lignocellulose-containing cultures composed of cereal bran or forest litter, transcription of mnp1 gene was followed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. On spruce needle litter, mnp1 expression was more abundant than on leaf litter after three weeks cultivation. However, the expression was constitutive in wheat and rye bran cultures. Our data show that the atypical MnP of A. praecox is able to catalyse Mn(2+) oxidation, which suggests its involvement in lignocellulose decay by this litter-decomposer."

(1) Translocations with Lr9 and Lr19 decreased embryo frequency and green plant regeneration. (2) Both F1 hybrids showed a decrease in embryo frequency. One of the F1 hybrids, S29 (Lr19+Rht1)/S29 (Ppd1+Ppd2) showed a decrease, with respect to S29 for green plant regeneration; the other F1 S29 (Pro1+Pro2)/S29 (Lr19+Rht1), equalled S29 for green plant regeneration. (3) The gene complex of the F1 hybrid S29 (Pro1+Pro2)/S29 (Lr19+Rht1) was better than that of the F1 hybrid S29 (Lr19+Rht1)/S29 (Ppd1+Ppd2) for embryo induction and green plant regeneration. This effect was possibly induced by interactions between the Pro1+Pro2 and Lr19+Rht1 genes or was the result of direct actions of the Pro1+Pro2 genes."

"24446316","abstracttext","Griffonia simplicifolia lectin II (GSII) and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) are N-acetylglucosamine-binding lectins. Previous studies demonstrated that they have anti-insect activity, a property potentially useful in pest control. To gain some insight into the insect response to dietary lectins, we performed transcriptomic analysis using the cowpea bruchid (Callosobruchus maculatus) midgut microarray platform we built. Compared to the nonnutritional cellulose treatment, dietary lectins induced more profound changes in gene expression. Ingestion of relatively high doses of lectins for 24 h resulted in alteration of gene expression involved in sugar and lipid metabolism, transport, development, defense, and stress tolerance. Metabolic genes were largely downregulated. Moreover, we observed disorganized microvilli resulting from ingestion of WGA. This morphological change is consistent with the lectin-induced changes in genes related to midgut epithelial cell repair. In addition, suboptimal nutrient conditions may serve as a stress signal to trigger senescence processes, leading to growth arrest and developmental delay."

"24264413","abstracttext","The effect of gibberellic acid (GA3) on gene expression in wheat aleurone cells has been characterised. In-vitro translation of polyadenylated RNA indicated that α-amylase and other messenger-RNA (mRNA) species increase in relative concentration in GA3-treated tissue. At least one mRNA species declines in relative level in response to GA3. There is also a GA3-dependent, four-fold increase in the level of polyadenylated RNA. This effect is largely the result of increased levels of many mRNA species which are also present in untreated tissue. Seven GA3-induced polyadenylated RNA species including the Amyl α-amylase gene product have been cloned as complementary DNA in the plasmid pBR322. These cloned DNAs have been used as hybridisation probes to show that the GA3-induced increase in α-amylase mRNA is more prolonged than the accumulation of the other GA3-regulated mRNA species. A polyadenylated-RNA sequence showing reduced concentration in GA3-treated tissue has also been cloned."

"24957701","abstracttext_main conclusion","BdDOF24 interacting with BdGAMYB regulates the BdCathB gene upon germination. During barley seed germination, hydrolytic enzymes (α-amylases, proteases, etc.) synthesized in the aleurone layer in response to gibberellins (GA), catalyse the mobilization of storage reserves accumulated in the endosperm during seed maturation. In Brachypodium distachyon, the BdCathB gene that encodes a Cathepsin B-like thiol-protease, orthologous to the wheat Al21 and barley HvCathB, is highly induced in germinating seeds and its expression is regulated by transcription factors (TFs) encoded by genes BdGamyb and BdDof24, orthologous to the barley HvGamyb and BPBF-HvDof24, respectively. Transcripts of both TF genes increase during germination and treatments with abscisic acid (ABA) or paclobutrazol (PAC, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis) decrease mRNA expression of BdGamyb but do not affect that of BdDof24. Besides, proteins BdDOF24 and BdGAMYB interact in yeast-2 hybrid systems and in plant nuclei, and in transient expression assays in aleurone layers BdDOF24 is a transcriptional repressor and BdGAMYB is an activator of the BdCathB promoter, as occurs with the putative orthologous in barley BPBF-HvDOF24 and HvGAMYB. However, when both TFs are co-bombarded, BdDOF24 enhances the activation driven by BdGAMYB while BPBF-HvDOF24 strongly decreases the HvGAMYB-mediated activation of the BdCathB promoter. The different results obtained when BdDOF24 and BPBF-HvDOF24 interact with BdGAMYB and HvGAMYB are discussed."

"25026671","abstracttext","Pheromone traps have been widely used to monitor insect population activity. However, sticky pheromone traps for the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor), one of the most destructive pests of wheat, have been used only in recent years. Hessian fly male adults are small and fragile, and preserving specimens during sorting of sticky pheromone traps is a challenge when intact specimens are often required to visually distinguish them from related insects such as fungus gnats. In this study, we have established a quick and reliable method based on polymerase chain reaction markers to correctly distinguish Hessian fly males from other closely related insects. Two Hessian fly-specific markers were established, one based on the trypsin gene MDP-10 and the other based on a gene encoding the salivary gland protein SSGP31-5. Both markers provided > 98% identification success of 110 Hessian fly samples prepared from single insects. The method should provide a useful tool to allow for identification of Hessian fly individuals on sticky pheromone traps or in other situations when Hessian fly eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults are difficult to distinguish from other insects."

"25149235","abstracttext","Water chickweed is a widespread and competitive winter annual or biennial weed of wheat in China. One Water chickweed population (HN02) resistant to several acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors was found in Henan province of China. Whole-plant bioassays showed that HN02 was high resistance to tribenuron (292.05-flod). In vitro ALS assays revealed that resistance was due to reduced sensitivity of the ALS enzyme to tribenuron. The I50 value for HN02 was 85.53 times greater respectively than that of susceptible population (SD05). This altered ALS sensitivity in the resistant population was due to a mutation in the ALS gene resulting in a Pro197 to Ser substitution. Cross-resistance experiments indicated that HN02 exhibited various resistance patterns to pyrithiobac-sodium, florasulam and pyroxsulam, without resistance to imazethapyr. This is the first report of tribenuron-resistant Water chickweed in Henan province of China, target-site based resistance was established as being due to an insensitive form of ALS, resulting from a Pro to Ser substitution at amino acid position 197 in the ALS gene."

It is classified along with wheat, barley, oats and Brachypodium distachyon in the Pooideae sub-family of the grass family (Poaceae). Transcriptome data was used to identify 28,455 gene models, and we utilized macro-co-linearity between perennial ryegrass and barley, and synteny within the grass family, to establish a synteny-based linear gene order. The gametophytic self-incompatibility mechanism enables the pistil of a plant to reject self-pollen and therefore promote out-crossing. We have used the sequence assembly to characterize transcriptional changes in the stigma during pollination with both compatible and incompatible pollen. Characterization of the pollen transcriptome identified homologs to pollen allergens from a range of species, many of which were expressed to very high levels in mature pollen grains, and are potentially involved in the self-incompatibility mechanism. The genome sequence provides a valuable resource for future breeding efforts based on genomic prediction, and will accelerate the development of new varieties for more productive grasslands."

"26173115","abstracttext","Exposing fully cold-acclimated wheat plants to a mild freeze-thaw cycle of -3 °C for 24h followed by +3 °C for 24 or 48 h results in dramatically improved tolerance of subsequent exposure to sub-freezing temperatures. Gene enrichment analysis of crown tissue from plants collected before or after the -3 °C freeze or after thawing at +3 °C for 24 or 48 h revealed that many biological processes and molecular functions were activated during the freeze-thaw cycle in an increasing cascade of responses such that over 150 processes or functions were significantly enhanced by the end of the 48 h, post-freeze thaw. Nearly 2,000 individual genes were upregulated more than 2-fold over the 72 h course of freezing and thawing, but more than 70% of these genes were upregulated during only one of the time periods examined, suggesting a series of genes and gene functions were involved in activation of the processes that led to enhanced freezing tolerance. This series of functions appeared to include extensive cell signaling, activation of stress response mechanisms and the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, extensive modification of secondary metabolites, and physical restructuring of cell membranes. By identifying plant lines that are especially able to activate these multiple mechanisms it may be possible to develop lines with enhanced winterhardiness."

The chromosomal location of Sec2 loci in wild Secale species, Secale africanum, was carried out by the wheat--S. africanum derivatives, which were identified by genomic in situ hybridization and multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization. The Sec2 gene-specific PCR analysis indicated that the S. cereale Sec2 was located on chromosome 2R, while the S. africanum Sec2 was localized on chromosome 6Rafr of S. africanum. A total of 38 Sec2 gene sequences were isolated from S. africanum, S. cereale and S. sylvestre by PCR-based cloning. Phylogenetic analysis showed that S. africanum Sec2 diverged from S. cereale Sec2 approximately 2-3 million years ago. The illegitimate recombination of chromosome 2R-6R involving the Sec2 loci region may accelerate sequence variation during evolutionary process from wild to cultivated Secale species."

"25356548","abstracttext","Sitobion avenae is a major agricultural pest of wheat in China. Using microsatellite markers, we studied the potential gene flow, genetic diversity, genetic differentiation, and genetic structure of seven S. avenae populations from different regions of China (Beijing, Hebei, Henan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces). The populations from Henan, Shandong, and Jiangsu showed high levels of genic and genotypic diversity. By contrast, the genic diversity in the Beijing and Hebei populations was much lower. Despite this low genic diversity, the genotypic diversity of the Beijing population was higher than that of all of the other populations, except those from Jiangsu and Shandong. Overall, the genetic divergence among the seven S. avenae populations tested was high, though there was almost no differentiation between the Shandong and Henan populations. We observed significant negative correlation between the strength of gene flow and the geographic distances among populations. Based on genetic analysis, the seven S. avenae populations studied can be divided into four distinct clusters; (i) Hubei, (ii) Shanxi, (iii) Beijing and Hebei, and (iv) Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu. The present results provide a basis for potentially optimizing integrated pest management (IPM) programs in China, through adapting control methods that target biological traits shared by various populations of the same genotype."

These reads were then de novo assembled into 120,715 unigenes with an average length of 627 bp. Functional annotations were then obtained by aligning all unigenes with public protein databases. In total, 9657 potential EST-SSRs were identified, and 6310 primer pairs for 1329 SSRs were obtained. Meanwhile, a comparison of four tag-based digital gene expression libraries, which was built from the control and cold-treated young spikes were performed. Overall, 526 up-regulated and 489 down-regulated genes were identified, and GO and KEGG pathway analyses of those genes were further conducted. Based on these results, a series of candidate genes involved in cold response pathways were identified, and 12 of them were confirmed by qRT-PCR. The combination of RNA-Seq and digital gene expression analysis in this study provides a powerful approach for investigating the transcriptional changes and obtained a large number of unigenes annotated to public databases."

"26092798","abstracttext","Understanding the cellular organization and biology of fungal pathogens requires accurate methods for genomic integration of mutant alleles or fluorescent fusion-protein constructs. In Zymoseptoria tritici, this can be achieved by integrating of plasmid DNA randomly into the genome of this wheat pathogen. However, untargeted ectopic integration carries the risk of unwanted side effects, such as altered gene expression, due to targeting regulatory elements, or gene disruption following integration into protein-coding regions of the genome. Here, we establish the succinate dehydrogenase (sdi1) locus as a single ""soft-landing"" site for targeted ectopic integration of genetic constructs by using a carboxin-resistant sdi1(R) allele, carrying the point-mutation H267L. We use various green and red fluorescent fusion constructs and show that 97% of all transformants integrate correctly into the sdi1 locus as single copies. We also demonstrate that such integration does not affect the pathogenicity of Z. tritici, and thus the sdi1 locus is a useful tool for virulence analysis in genetically modified Z. tritici strains. Furthermore, we have developed a vector which facilitates yeast recombination cloning and thus allows assembly of multiple overlapping DNA fragments in a single cloning step for high throughput vector and strain generation."

"26071810","abstracttext","Alopecurus aequalis, a predominant weed species in wheat and oilseed rape fields, can no longer be controlled by mesosulfuron-methyl application after continuous use over several years. Based on dose-response studies, the putative resistant populations, JTJY-1 and JHHZ-1, were found to be resistant to mesosulfuron-methyl, with resistance index values of 5.5 and 14, respectively. Sensitivity assays of the mesosulfuron-methyl-resistant populations to other herbicides revealed that the JTJY-1 population had moderate or high cross resistance to sulfonylureas (SUs) and triazolopyrimidines (TPs), but displayed a low level resistance to imidazolinones (IMIs). JTJY-1 also had high multi-resistance to ACCase inhibitors, but remained susceptible to photosystem II inhibitors. The JHHZ-1 population was resistant to all ALS inhibitors tested, but was sensitive to ACCase inhibitors and photosystem II inhibitors. To clarify the molecular basis of resistance in JTJY-1 and JHHZ-1 population, the ALS and ACCase gene were sequenced. Two ALS mutations (Pro-197-Thr or Trp-574-Leu) were detected in the mesosulfuron-methyl-resistant plants. The ACCase gene analysis revealed that the resistant JTJY-1 population had an Ile-1781-Leu mutation. Furthermore, the presence of two different target site resistance (TSR) mechanisms (ALS and ACCase mutations) existing simultaneously in individual A. aequalis was firstly documented in the presented study."

"26058921","abstracttext","Adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) is a constitutive mitochondrial component that is involved in ADP/ATP exchange and mitochondrion-mediated apoptosis in yeast and mammals. However, little is known about the function of ANT in pathogenic fungi. In this study, we identified an ANT gene of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), designated PsANT. The PsANT protein contains three typical conserved mitochondrion-carrier-protein (mito-carr) domains and shares more than 70% identity with its orthologs from other fungi, suggesting that ANT is conserved in fungi. Immuno-cytochemical localization confirmed the mitochondrial localization of PsANT in normal Pst hyphal cells or collapsed cells. Over-expression of PsANT indicated that PsANT promotes cell death in tobacco, wheat and fission yeast cells. Further study showed that the three mito-carr domains are all needed to induce cell death. qRT-PCR analyses revealed an in-planta induced expression of PsANT during infection. Knockdown of PsANT using a host-induced gene silencing system (HIGS) attenuated the growth and development of virulent Pst at the early infection stage but not enough to alter its pathogenicity. These results provide new insight into the function of PsANT in fungal cell death and growth and might be useful in the search for and design of novel disease control strategies."

"26025896","abstracttext","Alternariol (AOH) is an important mycotoxin from the Alternaria fungi. AOH was detected for the first time in the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum in a recent study. Here, we exploited reverse genetics to demonstrate that SNOG_15829 (SnPKS19), a close homolog of Penicillium aethiopicum norlichexanthone (NLX) synthase gene gsfA, is required for AOH production. We further validate that SnPKS19 is solely responsible for AOH production by heterologous expression in Aspergillus nidulans. The expression profile of SnPKS19 based on previous P. nodorum microarray data correlated with the presence of AOH in vitro and its absence in planta. Subsequent characterization of the ΔSnPKS19 mutants showed that SnPKS19 and AOH are not involved in virulence and oxidative stress tolerance. Identification and characterization of the P. nodorum SnPKS19 cast light on a possible alternative AOH synthase gene in Alternaria alternata and allowed us to survey the distribution of AOH synthase genes in other fungal genomes. We further demonstrate that phylogenetic analysis could be used to differentiate between AOH synthases and the closely related NLX synthases. This study provides the basis for studying the genetic regulation of AOH production and for development of molecular diagnostic methods for detecting AOH-producing fungi in the future."

"26052312","abstracttext","Paenibacillus polymyxa is a common soil bacterium with broad range of practical applications. An important group of secondary metabolites in P. polymyxa are non-ribosomal peptide and polyketide derived metabolites (NRPs/PKs). Modular non-ribosomal peptide synthetases catalyze main steps in the biosynthesis of the complex secondary metabolites. Here we report on the inactivation of an A26 Sfp-type 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase (Sfp-type PPTase). The inactivation of the gene resulted in loss of NRPs/PKs production. In contrast to the former Bacillus spp. model the mutant strain compared to wild type showed greatly enhanced biofilm formation ability. A26Δsfp biofilm promotion is directly mediated by NRPs/PKs, as exogenous addition of the wild type metabolite extracts restores its biofilm formation level. Wheat inoculation with bacteria that had lost their Sfp-type PPTase gene resulted in two times higher plant survival and about three times increased biomass under severe drought stress compared to wild type. Challenges with P. polymyxa genetic manipulation are discussed."

"26206730","abstracttext","Pong-like elements are members of the PIF/Harbinger superfamily of DNA transposons that has been described in many plants, animals, and fungi. Most Pong elements contain two open reading frames (ORFs). One encodes a transposase (ORF2) that catalyzes transposition of Pong and related non-autonomous elements, while the function of the second is unknown. Little is known about the evolutionary history of Pong elements in flowering plants. In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the diversity, abundance, and evolution of the Pong-like transposase gene in the genomes of 21 diploid species from the wheat tribe, Triticeae, and we present the first convincing evidence of horizontal transfer of nuclear-encoded Pong elements in any organism. A phylogenetic analysis of nearly 300 Pong sequences based on a conserved region of the transposase domain revealed a complex evolutionary history of Pong elements that can be best explained by ancestral polymorphism, followed by differential evolutionary success of some transposase lineages, and by occasional horizontal transfer between phylogenetically distant genera. In addition, we used transposon display to estimate the abundance of the transposase gene within Triticeae genomes, and our results revealed varying levels of Pong proliferation, with numbers of transposase copies ranging from 22 to 92. Comparisons of Pong transposase abundance to flow cytometry estimates of genome size revealed that larger Triticeae genome size was not correlated with transposase abundance."

The traditional substrate-specificity analysis for AFs is labor-consuming and money costing, because the substrates include over 30 kinds of various 4-nitrophenol (PNP)-glycosides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides.

"25870922","abstracttext","The spring wheat 'Canthatch' has been shown to suppress stem rust resistance genes in the background due to the presence of a suppressor gene located on the long arm of chromosome 7D. However, it is unclear whether the suppressor also suppresses resistance genes against leaf rust and stripe rust. In this study, we investigated the specificity of the resistance suppression. To determine whether the suppression is genome origin specific, chromosome location specific, or rust species or race specific, we introduced 11 known rust resistance genes into the Canthatch background, including resistance to leaf, stripe, or stem rusts, originating from A, B, or D genomes and located on different chromosome homologous groups. F1 plants of each cross were tested with the corresponding rust race, and the infection types were scored and compared with the parents. Our results show that the Canthatch 7DL suppressor only suppressed stem rust resistance genes derived from either the A or B genome, and the pattern of the suppression is gene specific and independent of chromosomal location."

"25703795","abstracttext","Wheat scab caused by Fusarium graminearum is an important disease. In a previous study, the FGK3 glycogen synthase kinase gene orthologous to mammalian GSK3 was identified as an important virulence factor. Although GSK3 orthologs are well-conserved, none of them have been functionally characterized in fungal pathogens. In this study, we further characterized the roles of FGK3 gene. The Δfgk3 mutant had pleiotropic defects in growth rate, conidium morphology, germination, and perithecium formation. It was non-pathogenic in infection assays and blocked in DON production. Glycogen accumulation was increased in the Δfgk3 mutant, confirming the inhibitory role of Fgk3 on glycogen synthase. In FGK3-GFP transformants, GFP signals mainly localized to the cytoplasm in conidia but to the cytoplasm and nucleus in hyphae. Moreover, the expression level of FGK3 increased in response to cold, H2O2, and SDS stresses. In the Δfgk3 mutant, cold, heat, and salt stresses failed to induce the expression of the stress response-related genes FgGRE2, FgGPD1, FgCTT1, and FgMSN2. In the presence of 80 mM LiCl, a GSK3 kinase inhibitor, the wild type displayed similar defects to the Δfgk3 mutant. Overall, our results indicate that FGK3 is important for growth, conidiogenesis, DON production, pathogenicity, and stress responses in F. graminearum."

"26883048","abstracttext_key message","Models based on additive marker effects and on epistatic interactions can be translated into genomic relationship models. This equivalence allows to perform predictions based on complex gene interaction models and reduces computational effort significantly. In the theory of genome-assisted prediction, the equivalence of a linear model based on independent and identically normally distributed marker effects and a model based on multivariate Gaussian distributed breeding values with genomic relationship as covariance matrix is well known. In this work, we demonstrate equivalences of marker effect models incorporating epistatic interactions and corresponding mixed models based on relationship matrices and show how to exploit these equivalences computationally for genome-assisted prediction. In particular, we show how models with epistatic interactions of higher order (e.g., three-factor interactions) translate into linear models with certain covariance matrices and demonstrate how to construct epistatic relationship matrices for the linear mixed model, if we restrict the model to interactions defined a priori. We illustrate the practical relevance of our results with a publicly available data set on grain yield of wheat lines growing in four different environments. For this purpose, we select important interactions in one environment and use this knowledge on the network of interactions to increase predictive ability of grain yield under other environmental conditions. Our results provide a guide for building relationship matrices based on knowledge on the structure of trait-related gene networks."

Except a few members, the AP2/EREBP family has not been characterized in Brachypodium distachyon, a model plant of Poaceae. We performed a genome-wide study of this family in B. distachyon by phylogenetic analyses, transactivation assays and transcript profiling. A total of 149 AP2/EREBP genes were identified and divided into four subfamilies, i.e., ERF (ethylene responsive factor), DREB (dehydration responsive element binding gene), RAV (related to ABI3/VP) and AP2. Tandem duplication was a major force in expanding B. distachyon AP2/EREBP (BdAP2/EREBP) family. Despite a significant expansion, genomic organizations of BdAP2/EREBPs were monotonous as the majority of them, except those of AP2 subfamily, had no intron. An analysis of transcription activities of several closely related and duplicated BdDREB genes showed their functional divergence and redundancy in evolution. The expression of BdAP2/EREBPs in different tissues and the expression of DREB/ERF subfamilies in B. distachyon, wheat and rice under abiotic stresses were investigated by next-generation sequencing and microarray profiling. Our results are valuable for further function analysis of stress tolerant AP2/EREBP genes in B. distachyon."

"26708413","abstracttext","Modular proteins are an evolutionary answer to optimize performance of proteins that physically interact with each other for functionality. Using a combination of genetic and biochemical experiments, we characterized the rice protein OsJAC1, which consists of a jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domain predicted to bind mannose-containing oligosaccharides, and a dirigent domain which might function in stereoselective coupling of monolignols. Transgenic overexpression of OsJAC1 in rice resulted in quantitative broad-spectrum resistance against different pathogens including bacteria, oomycetes, and fungi. Overexpression of this gene or its wheat ortholog TAJA1 in barley enhanced resistance against the powdery mildew fungus. Both protein domains of OsJAC1 are required to establish resistance as indicated by single or combined transient expression of individual domains. Expression of artificially separated and fluorescence-tagged protein domains showed that the JRL domain is sufficient for targeting the powdery mildew penetration site. Nevertheless, co-localization of the lectin and the dirigent domain occurred. Phylogenetic analyses revealed orthologs of OsJAC1 exclusively within the Poaceae plant family. Dicots, by contrast, only contain proteins with either JRL or dirigent domain(s). Altogether, our results identify OsJAC1 as a representative of a novel type of resistance protein derived from a plant lineage-specific gene fusion event for better function in local pathogen defense."

"26699689","abstracttext_background","A search is underway for new solutions to counter farm loss caused by fungal contamination of grains, since the active agents of fungicides can remain in the environment and contribute to the development of resistant and toxigenic species. In this study, the antifungal activity of natural compounds (γ-oryzanol, phenolic extract of neem seeds and of rice bran) was assessed on three toxigenic strains of Fusarium graminearum isolated from wheat, rice and barley. Their efficacy was compared to that of synthetic fungicides. The halo diameters were measured and the susceptible pathways were determined by the levels of structural compounds and activities of enzymes involved in the primary metabolism of the microorganisms. Moreover, mycotoxin production and gene expression were examined."

"27135336","articletitle","NAC Transcription Factors in Senescence: From Molecular Structure to Function in Crops."
"27135336","abstracttext","Within the last decade, NAC transcription factors have been shown to play essential roles in senescence, which is the focus of this review. Transcriptome analyses associate approximately one third of Arabidopsis NAC genes and many crop NAC genes with senescence, thereby implicating NAC genes as important regulators of the senescence process. The consensus DNA binding site of the NAC domain is used to predict NAC target genes, and protein interaction sites can be predicted for the intrinsically disordered transcription regulatory domains of NAC proteins. The molecular characteristics of these domains determine the interactions in gene regulatory networks. Emerging local NAC-centered gene regulatory networks reveal complex molecular mechanisms of stress- and hormone-regulated senescence and basic physiological steps of the senescence process. For example, through molecular interactions involving the hormone abscisic acid, Arabidopsis NAP promotes chlorophyll degradation, a hallmark of senescence. Furthermore, studies of the functional rice ortholog, OsNAP, suggest that NAC genes can be targeted to obtain specific changes in lifespan control and nutrient remobilization in crop plants. This is also exemplified by the wheat NAM1 genes which promote senescence and increase grain zinc, iron, and protein content. Thus, NAC genes are promising targets for fine-tuning senescence for increased yield and quality."

"27388555","abstracttext","To understand physiological phenomena at the tissue level, elucidation of tissue-specific molecular functions in vivo is required. As an example of the current state of affairs, many genes in plants have been reported to have discordant levels of expression between bulk tissues and the specific tissues in which the respective gene product is principally functional. The principal challenge in deciphering such tissue-specific functions lies in separating tissues with high spatiotemporal resolution to evaluate accurate gene expression profiles. Here, we provide a simple and rapid tissue isolation protocol to isolate all three major leaf tissues (mesophyll, vasculature and epidermis) from Arabidopsis within 30 min with high purity. On the basis of the different cell-to-cell connectivities of tissues, the mesophyll isolation is achieved by making protoplasts, and the vasculature and epidermis isolation is achieved through sonication and enzymatic digestion of leaves. We have successfully tested the protocol on several other plant species, including crop plants such as soybean, tomato and wheat. Furthermore, isolated tissues can be used not only for tissue-specific transcriptome assays but also potentially for tissue-specific proteome and methylome assays."

"27215438","abstracttext_key message","We found a histone variant enhances drought tolerance partially via promoting stomatal closure other than osmotic stress resistance, indicating the crucial and complicated contribution of epigenetic regulation to abiotic stress response. Histone variants epigenetically regulate gene transcription through remodeling chromatin. They have been implicated in modulating plant abiotic stress response, however, the role(s) is not well documented. Here, we identified an abiotic stress responsive H2A variant gene TaH2A.7 from wheat. TaH2A.7 shared high identity with H2A homologs and localized to the nucleus. TaH2A.7 overexpression in Arabidopsis significantly enhanced drought tolerance, but had no effect on the response to saline, osmotic and oxidative stresses. TaH2A.7 lowered water loss rate, and promoted ABA-induced stomatal closure. In TaH2A.7 overexpression plants, the mRNA levels of numerous genes involved in the ABA pathway and stomatal movement signaling pathway were elevated, H2O2 level in guard cells was increased, as well. Together, TaH2A.7 can enhance drought tolerance via, at least in part, promoting stomatal closure, and appears to be a promising target for molecular breeding."

DNA-DNA hybridization studies showed a mean of 30 % DNADNA relatedness between strain AMTAE16T and the type strain of P. daejeonensis. The isolate was a Gram-stainvariable, motile and sporulating rod. Catalase and oxidase activities were positive. Gelatin and starch were hydrolysed but not casein. Growth was supported by many carbohydrates and organic acids as carbon source. MK-7 was the only menaquinone detected and anteiso-C15 : 0, C16 : 0 and iso-C16 : 0 were the major fatty acids. The major polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, two unidentified aminophospholipids, four unidentified phospholipids and two unidentified lipids. meso-Diaminopimelic acid was detected in the peptidoglycan. The DNA G+C content was 55.4 mol%. Phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic analyses showed that strain AMTAE16T represents a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus hispanicus sp. nov. is proposed.

"27352233","abstracttext","Alkylresorcinols (ARs, 5-n-alkylresorcinols) are amphiphilic phenolic lipids in whole grain rye and wheat, with a long odd-numbered carbon chain. A preventive effect of whole grain diet on sex hormone-dependent cancers has been recognized, but the active component(s) or mechanisms are not known. We have investigated the effects of the ARs C15:0, C19:0, and C21:0, individually and in combination, on steroid hormone production by using the human adrenocortical cell line H295R. Decreased synthesis of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), testosterone, and estradiol was demonstrated at low concentrations of C15:0 and C19:0. There were no indications of additive effects on steroid secretion from the combined treatment with equimolar concentrations of the three ARs. Gene expressions of CYP21A2, HSD3B2, and CYP19A1 were downregulated and CYP11A1 was upregulated by the ARs. The results on gene expression could not explain the effects on steroidogenesis, which may be due to direct effects on enzyme activities, such as inhibition of CYP17A1. Our results demonstrate suppressed synthesis of testosterone and estradiol by ARs suggesting a novel mechanism for ARs in the chemoprevention of prostate and breast cancer."

"27340568","abstracttext","Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are important resource for gene discovery, gene expression and its regulation, molecular marker development, and comparative genomics. We procured 10000 ESTs and analyzed 267 EST-SSRs markers through computational approach. The average density was one SSR/10.45 kb or 6.4% frequency, wherein trinucleotide repeats (66.74%) were the most abundant followed by di- (26.10%), tetra- (4.67%), penta- (1.5%), and hexanucleotide (1.2%) repeats. Functional annotations were done and after-effect newly developed 63 EST-SSRs were used for cross transferability, genetic diversity, and bulk segregation analysis (BSA). Out of 63 EST-SSRs, 42 markers were identified owing to their expansion genetics across 20 different plants which amplified 519 alleles at 180 loci with an average of 2.88 alleles/locus and the polymorphic information content (PIC) ranged from 0.51 to 0.93 with an average of 0.83. The cross transferability ranged from 25% for wheat to 97.22% for Schlerostachya, with an average of 55.86%, and genetic relationships were established based on diversification among them. Moreover, 10 EST-SSRs were recognized as important markers between bulks of pooled DNA of sugarcane cultivars through BSA. This study highlights the employability of the markers in transferability, genetic diversity in grass species, and distinguished sugarcane bulks."

"27181952","abstracttext","Ubiquitination plays an important role in regulating plant's development and adaptability to abiotic stress. To investigate the possible functions of a wheat monoubiquitin gene Ta-Ub2 in abiotic stress in monocot and compare it with that in dicot, we generated transgenic Brachypodium plants overexpressing Ta-Ub2 under the control of CaMV35s and stress-inducible RD29A promoters. The constitutive expression of Ta-Ub2 displayed slight growth inhibition in the growth of transgenic Brachypodium distachyon under the control conditions. However, this inhibition was minimized by expression of Ta-Ub2 under the control of stress-inducible RD29A promoter. Compared with WT, the transgenic plants preserved more water and showed higher enzymatic antioxidants under drought stress, which might be related to the change in the expression of some antioxidant genes. The expression of C-repeat binding factors transcription factor genes in the transgenic B. distachyon lines were upregulated under water stress. Salt and cold tolerances of transgenic B. distachyon were also improved. Although the phenotypic changes in the transgenic plants were different, overexpression of Ta-Ub2 improved the abiotic stress tolerance in both dicot and monocot plants. The improvement in Ta-Ub2 transgenic plants in abiotic stress tolerance might be, at least partly, through regulating the gene expression and increasing the enzymatic antioxidants."

"29186895","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON) is commonly detected in cereals, and is a threat to human and animal health. The effects of microbiological detoxification are now being widely studied. A total of 24 pigs (over four months) were randomly divided into three treatments. Treatment A was fed with a basal diet as the control group. Treatment B was fed with naturally DON-contaminated wheat as a negative control group. Treatment C was fed with a contaminated diet that also had Clostridium sp. WJ06, which was used as a detoxicant. Growth performance, relative organ weight, intestinal morphology, and the intestinal flora of bacteria and fungi were examined. The results showed that after consuming a DON-contaminated diet, the growth performance of the pigs decreased significantly ( p < 0.05), the relative organ weight of the liver and kidney increased significantly ( p < 0.05), and the integrity of the intestinal barrier was also impaired, though the toxic effects of the contaminated diets on growing pigs were relieved after adding Clostridium sp. WJ06. The data from MiSeq sequencing of the 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) gene and internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) gene suggested that the abundance of intestinal flora was significantly different across the three treatments. In conclusion, the application of Clostridium sp. WJ06 can reduce the toxic effects of DON and adjust the intestinal microecosystem of growing pigs."

"29193198","abstracttext","Humicola grisea var. thermoidea (Hgvt) is a thermophilic ascomycete that produces lignocellulolytic enzymes and it is proposed for the conversion of agricultural residues into useful byproducts. Drugs that inhibit the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) activity are employed in epigenetic studies but nothing is known about a possible effect on the production of fungal enzymes. We evaluated the effect of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza; a chemical inhibitor of DNMTs activity) on the secreted enzyme activity and on the transcription of cellulase and xylanase genes from Hgvt grown in agricultural residues and in glucose. Upon cultivation on wheat bran (WB), the drug provoked an increase in the xylanase activity at 96 h. When Hgvt was grown in glucose (GLU), a repressor of Hgvt glycosyl hydrolase genes, 5-Aza led to increased transcript accumulation for the cellobiohydrolases and for the xyn2 xylanase genes. In WB, 5-Aza enhanced the expression of the transcription factor CreA gene. Growth on WB or GLU, in presence of 5-Aza, led to a significant increase in transcripts of the pH-response regulator PacC gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of a DNMT inhibitor in the production of fungal plant cell wall degradation enzymes."
"28424497","articletitle","The glycogen synthase kinase MoGsk1, regulated by Mps1 MAP kinase, is required for fungal development and pathogenicity in Magnaporthe oryzae."
"28424497","abstracttext","Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of blast disease, is one of the most destructive plant pathogens, causing significant yield losses on staple crops such as rice and wheat. The fungus infects plants with a specialized cell called an appressorium, whose development is tightly regulated by MAPK signaling pathways following the activation of upstream sensors in response to environmental stimuli. Here, we show the expression of the Glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) MoGSK1 in M. oryzae is regulated by Mps1 MAP kinase, particularly under the stressed conditions. Thus, MoGSK1 is functionally characterized in this study. MoGsk1 is functionally homologues to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GSK3 homolog MCK1. Gene replacement of MoGSK1 caused significant delay in mycelial growth, complete loss of conidiation and inability to penetrate the host surface by mycelia-formed appressorium-like structures, consequently resulting in loss of pathogenicity. However, the developmental and pathogenic defects of Δmogsk1 are recovered via the heterologous expression of Fusarium graminearum GSK3 homolog gene FGK3, whose coding products also shows the similar cytoplasmic localization as MoGsk1 does in M. oryzae. By contrast, overexpression of MoGSK1 produced deformed appressoria in M. oryzae. In summary, our results suggest that MoGsk1, as a highly conservative signal modulator, dictates growth, conidiation and pathogenicity of M. oryzae."

"28613837","abstracttext","We constructed novel artificial riboswitches that function in a eukaryotic translation system (wheat germ extract), by rationally implanting an in vitro-selected aptamer into the intergenic internal ribosome entry site (IRES) of Plautia stali intestine virus. These eukaryotic OFF-riboswitches (OFF-eRSs) ligand-dose-dependently downregulate IRES-mediated translation without hybridization switches, which typical riboswitches utilize for gene regulation. The hybridization-switch-free mechanism not only allows for easy design but also requires less energy for regulation, resulting in a higher switching efficiency than hybridization-switch-based OFF-eRSs provide. In addition, even a small ligand such as theophylline can induce satisfactory repression, in contrast to other types of OFF-eRSs that modulate the 5' cap-dependent canonical translation. Because our proposed hybridization-switch-free OFF-eRSs are based on a versatile IRES that functions well in many types of eukaryotic translation systems, they would be widely usable elements for synthetic gene circuits in both cell-free and cell-based synthetic biology."

"27820649","abstracttext","A gene encoding 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic oxidase (ACO), which catalyzes the terminal step in ethylene biosynthesis, was isolated from Agrostis stolonifera. The AsACO gene is composed of 975 bp, encoding 324 amino acids. Three exons interspersed by two introns form AsACO gDNA. A BLAST search of the nucleotide sequence revealed a high level of similarity (79-91%) between AsACO and ACO genes of other plants. A phylogenetic tree was constructed via BLAST in the NCBI, and revealed the highest homology with wheat TaACO. The calculated molecular mass and predicted isoelectric point of AsACO were 36.25 and 4.89 kDa, respectively. Analysis of subcellular localization revealed that AsACO is located in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The Fe(II)-binding cofactors and cosubstrate were identified, pertaining to the ACO family. The expression patterns of AsACO were determined by quantitative real time PCR. AsACO expression was highest in the stem, and was strongly up-regulated in response to ethephon, methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, and cold temperature, but down-regulated in response to drought and NaCl treatment. The protein encoded by AsACO exhibited ACC oxidase activity in vitro. Taken together, these findings suggest that AsACO contains domains common to the ACO family, and is induced in response to exogenous hormones. Conversely, some abiotic stress conditions can inhibit AsACO expression."

"28193629","abstracttext","Polyploidy is a major evolutionary process in eukaryotes, yet the expression balance of homeologs in natural polyploids is largely unknown. To study this expression balance, the expression patterns of 2180 structurally well-characterized genes of wheat were studied, of which 813 had the expected three copies and 375 had less than three. Copy numbers of the remaining 992 ranged from 4 to 14, including homeologs, orthologs, and paralogs. Of the genes with three structural copies corresponding to homeologs, 55% expressed from all three, 38% from two, and the remaining 7% expressed from only one of the three copies. Homeologs of 76-87% of the genes showed differential expression patterns in different tissues, thus have evolved different gene expression controls, possibly resulting in novel functions. Homeologs of 55% of the genes showed tissue-specific expression, with the largest percentage (14%) in the anthers and the smallest (7%) in the pistils. The highest number (1.72/3) of homeologs/gene expression was in the roots and the lowest (1.03/3) in the anthers. As the expression of homeologs changed with changes in structural copy number, about 30% of the genes showed dosage dependence. Chromosomal location also impacted expression pattern as a significantly higher proportion of genes in the proximal regions showed expression from all three copies compared to that present in the distal regions."
"28343064","articletitle","A barley homolog of yeast ATG6 is involved in multiple abiotic stress responses and stress resistance regulation."
"28343064","abstracttext","Autophagy is a highly conserved degradation pathway among eukaryote cells, which can recycle damaged or unwanted cell materials upon encountering stress conditions. As a key component of the Class III PI3K kinase complex, ATG6/Beclin-1 is essential for autophagosome formation. In this study, we isolated a putative HvATG6 gene in barley genome. The protein encoded by HvATG6 shares high sequence identity to ATG6 orthologs in rice and wheat, and has a typical autophagy-specific domain containing segments of repeated β-sheet-α-helix. The expression of HvATG6 protein restored the appearance of autophagosomes in yeast atg6 mutant, indicating that HvATG6 complements the deficiency of yeast ATG6 protein in autophagy. Punctate florescence signals, considered as the PAS for autophagosome initiation, were observed in the cytoplasm of cells when HvATG6-GFP fusion construct was transformed into barley protoplast. Furthermore, the expression of HvATG6 was upregulated by various abiotic stresses including dark, H 2 O 2 treatment, nitrogen deficiency, high salinity, drought, low temperature and toxic aluminum. Knockdown of HvATG6 in barley leaves through barley strip mosaic virus (BSMV)-induced gene silencing led to accelerated yellowing under dark and H 2 O 2 treatments. Based on the above findings, we propose that barley ATG6 plays the similar role as other plant ATG6 orthologs, and might be involved in stress-induced autophagy process."

"28742460","abstracttext","Resistance genes are a major tool for managing crop diseases. The networks of crop breeders who exchange resistance genes and deploy them in varieties help to determine the global landscape of resistance and epidemics, an important system for maintaining food security. These networks function as a complex adaptive system, with associated strengths and vulnerabilities, and implications for policies to support resistance gene deployment strategies. Extensions of epidemic network analysis can be used to evaluate the multilayer agricultural networks that support and influence crop breeding networks. Here, we evaluate the general structure of crop breeding networks for cassava, potato, rice, and wheat. All four are clustered due to phytosanitary and intellectual property regulations, and linked through CGIAR hubs. Cassava networks primarily include public breeding groups, whereas others are more mixed. These systems must adapt to global change in climate and land use, the emergence of new diseases, and disruptive breeding technologies. Research priorities to support policy include how best to maintain both diversity and redundancy in the roles played by individual crop breeding groups (public versus private and global versus local), and how best to manage connectivity to optimize resistance gene deployment while avoiding risks to the useful life of resistance genes.

"29722915","abstracttext","To investigate effector gene regulation in the wheat pathogenic fungus Parastagonospora nodorum, the promoter and expression of Tox3 was characterised through a series of complementary approaches. Promoter deletion and DNase I footprinting experiments identified a 25 bp region in the Tox3 promoter as being required for transcription. Subsequent yeast one-hybrid analysis using the DNA sequence as bait identified that interacting partner as the C2H2 zinc finger transcription factor PnCon7, a putative master regulator of pathogenesis. Silencing of PnCon7 resulted in the down-regulation of Tox3 demonstrating that the transcription factor has a positive regulatory role on gene expression. Analysis of Tox3 expression in the PnCon7 silenced strains revealed a strong correlation with PnCon7 transcript levels, supportive of a direct regulatory role. Subsequent pathogenicity assays using PnCon7-silenced isolates revealed that the transcription factor was required for Tox3-mediated disease. The expression of two other necrotrophic effectors (ToxA and Tox1) was also affected but in a non-dose dependent manner suggesting that the regulatory role of PnCon7 on these genes was indirect. Collectively, these data have advanced our fundamental understanding of the Con7 master regulator of pathogenesis by demonstrating its positive regulatory role on the Tox3 effector in P. nodorum through direct interaction."

"29728569","abstracttext","The SQUAMOSA-promoter binding like (SPL) gene family encodes transcription factors that have been shown in many species to influence plant growth and development, but information about these genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is limited. This study identified 17 barley SPL genes, within eight distinct groups, that are orthologs of SPL genes described in Arabidopsis, wheat, and rice. Sixteen barley SPLs undergo alternative splicing. Seven SPLs contain a putative miR156 target site and the transcript levels of the miR156-targeted HvSPLs (HvSPL3, 13 and 23) were lower in vegetative than in reproductive phase but this was true also for some SPL genes such as HvSPL6 that were not regulated by miR156. Because SPL gene products regulate miR172, which is also involved in floral development, the expression of miR172 was studied. An antagonistic expression pattern of miR156 and miR172b during the vegetative and the reproductive phases signifies their apparent function in barley growth phase transition. Characterization of a barley mir172 mutant having an abnormal, indeterminate spikelet phenotype suggests the possible feedback role of AP2/miR172 module on HvSPL genes. This is the first comprehensive analysis of the miR156/SPL/miR172 axis in barley that provides a basis to elucidate their roles in various biological processes."

These identified strains were classified by 879F-RAPD and 16S rRNA sequence analysis. RAPD analyses revealed that the 10 strains were clustered into seven 879F-RAPD groups, suggesting a clonal origin. 16S rRNA sequencing analyses allowed the assignment of the 10 strains to known groups of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, including organisms from the genera Paenibacillus, Enterobacter, Klebsiella and Pantoea. These representative genus are not endophytic diazotrophs in the conventional sense. They may have obtained nitrogen fixation ability through lateral gene transfer, however, the evolutionary forces of lateral gene transfer are not well known. Molecular identification results from 16S rRNA analyses were also confirmed by morphological and biochemical data. The test strains SH6A and MZB showed positive effect on the growth of plants."

"29031630","abstracttext","The dimorphic fungal pathogen, Zymoseptoria tritici undergoes discrete developmental changes to complete its life cycle on wheat. Molecular mechanisms underlying morphogenesis during infection process of Z. tritici are poorly understood. In this study, we have investigated the role of ZtVf1 gene encoding a transcription factor belonging to C 2 -H 2 subfamily. In planta assays revealed that ZtVf1 is required for virulence. Reduced necrotic lesions and low pycnidia density within the lesions resulted in significantly reduced virulence of ZtVf1 mutants. Cytological analysis showed that the impaired virulence of ZtVf1 mutants attributed to reduced penetration and colonization along with hampered pycnidia differentiation. In vitro phenotyping showed that ZtVf1 deletion affects hyphal branching and biomass production suggesting that the reduced tissue colonization by the ZtVf1 mutant might be due to lower hyphal branching and less fungal biomass production. In addition, the majority of infected substomatal cavities by the ZtVf1 mutant filled with compacted mycelia mat that did not differentiate to mature pycnidia indicating that the impaired melanization negatively affected pycnidia formation and maturation. The ZtVf1 might target multiple genes belonging to different cellular processes whose identification is of eminent interest to increase our understanding of this pathosystem. Overall, the data provided in this study indicates that attenuated pathogenicity of ZtVf1 mutant is due to involvement of this gene in the regulation of both early and late stages of infection."

"29151162","abstracttext","The aim of this study was to develop an effective bioaugmentation concept for anaerobic digesters treating lignocellulosic biomass such as straw. For that purpose, lignocellulose-degrading methanogenic communities were enriched on wheat straw from cow and goat rumen fluid as well as from a biogas reactor acclimated to lignocellulosic biomass (sorghum as mono-substrate). The bacterial communities of the enriched cultures and the different inocula were examined by 454 amplicon sequencing of 16S rRNA genes while the methanogenic archaeal communities were analyzed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) fingerprinting of the mcrA gene. Bacteroidetes was the most abundant phylum in all samples. Within the Bacteroidetes phylum, Bacteroidaceae was the most abundant family in the rumen-derived enrichment cultures, whereas Porphyromonadaceae was the predominant one in the reactor-derived culture. Additionally, the enrichment procedure increased the relative abundance of Ruminococcaceae (phylum: Firmicutes) in all cultures. T-RFLP profiles of the mcrA gene amplicons highlighted that the ruminal methanogenic communities were composed of hydrogenotrophic methanogens dominated by the order Methanobacteriales regardless of the host species. The methanogenic communities changed significantly during the enrichment procedure, but still the strict hydrogenotrophic Methanobacteriales and Methanomicrobiales were the predominant orders in the enrichment cultures. The bioaugmentation potential of the enriched methanogenic cultures will be evaluated in further studies."

"29671758","abstracttext","The color of grain in cereals is determined mainly by anthocyanin pigments. A large level of genetic diversity for anthocyanin content and composition in the grain of different species was observed. In rye, recessive mutations in six genes (vi1...vi6) lead to the absence of anthocyanins in all parts of the plant. Moreover, dominant genes of anthocyanin synthesis in aleurone (gene C) and pericarp (gene Vs) also affect the color of the grain. Reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry were used to study anthocyanins in 24 rye samples. A lack of anthocyanins in the lines with yellow and brown grain was determined. Delphinidin rutinoside and cyanidin rutinoside were found in the green-seeded lines. Six samples with violet grains significantly varied in terms of anthocyanin composition and content. However, the main aglycone was cyanidin or peonidin in all of them. Monosaccharide glucose and disaccharide rutinose served as the glycoside units. Violet-seeded accession forms differ in the ratio of the main anthocyanins and the range of their acylated derivatives. The acyl groups were presented mainly by radicals of malonic and sinapic acids. For the colored forms, a profile of the revealed anthocyanins with the indication of their contents was given. The obtained results are discussed in connection to similar data in rice, barley, and wheat, which will provide a perspective for future investigations."

"29891382","abstracttext","The small brown planthopper (SBPH), Laodelphax striatellus (Fallen) is a major pest insect of rice, wheat, and maize in China and other countries. SBPH not only damage rice plants through sucking plant sap, but also transmits rice virus diseases, for example, striped virus disease (RSV), black streaked dwarf, and maize rough disease virus. Therefore, understanding of pesticide-induced stimulation of reproduction in SBPH is of great significance for the pest management. Our previous study discovered that triazophos (TZP) increased reproduction of SBPH. But the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, by using proteomic analysis, we screened and cloned the gene of long chain fatty acid coenzyme A ligase (FACL), and silenced FACL to examine influences of TZP on reproduction and glycerin content in SBPH females. In TZP-treated females vs control females, there were 41 differential proteins in 18 pathways related to reproduction, of which 8 were up-regulated and 33 were down-regulated. TZP + dsFACL eliminated TZP-induced stimulation of reproduction of SBPH females (↓about 73.92%) and decreased glycerin content and body weight (↓about 19.93% and 13.62%). TZP + dsFACL treatment led to reduced expression of FACL (↓about 61.88%). FACL is a key gene of TZP-induced increase of reproduction of SBPH."

"29852333","abstracttext","Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is the fourth major cereal crop and shows high adaptive capabilities to diverse environments. Thus, it might represent a potential reservoir of novel genes to improve abiotic stress tolerance. In this study, a novel AP2/ERF transcription factor gene designated as HvSHN1 was isolated from barley. Protein sequence analysis showed that the HvSHN1 protein contained a nuclear localization signal and the conserved AP2/ERF domain. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HvSHN1 belongs to the group Va protein in the ERF subfamily which contains the Arabidopsis genes (SHN1, 2 and 3) and the wheat gene TdSHN1 with which it has 94.7% protein sequence identity. Expression profile analysis revealed that HvSHN1 is strongly induced by heat, cold, salt and drought. Transient expression using tobacco BY-2 protoplast coupled to confocal microscopy analysis revealed that HvSHN1 is exclusively targeted to the nucleus. Interestingly, when constitutively expressed in transgenic tobacco, HvSHN1 up-regulated stress responsive genes known to harbor GCC or DRE motif in their promoter regions. Therefore, HvSHN1 might represent a potential candidate for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in economically important crops."

"29930543","abstracttext","Rho GTPases are signaling macromolecules that are associated with developmental progression and pathogenesis of Fusarium graminearum . Generally, enzymatic activities of Rho GTPases are regulated by Rho GTPase guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs). In this study, we identified a putative RhoGEF encoding gene ( FgBUD3 ) in F. graminearum database and proceeded further by using a functional genetic approach to generate FgBUD3 targeted gene deletion mutant. Phenotypic analysis results showed that the deletion of FgBUD3 caused severe reduction in growth of FgBUD3 mutant generated during this study. We also observed that the deletion of FgBUD3 completely abolished sexual reproduction and triggered the production of abnormal asexual spores with nearly no septum in ΔFgbud3 strain. Further results obtained from infection assays conducted during this research revealed that the FgBUD3 defective mutant lost its pathogenicity on wheat and hence, suggests FgBud3 plays an essential role in the pathogenicity of F. graminearum . Additional, results derived from yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that FgBud3 strongly interacted with FgRho4 compared to the interaction with FgRho2, FgRho3, and FgCdc42. Moreover, we found that FgBud3 interacted with both GTP-bound and GDP-bound form of FgRho4. From these results, we subsequently concluded that, the Rho4-interacting GEF protein FgBud3 crucially promotes vegetative growth, asexual and sexual development, cell division and pathogenicity in F. graminearum ."

"31146387","abstracttext","Domestication and breeding have created productive crops that are adapted to the climatic conditions of their growing regions. Initially, this process solely relied on the frequent occurrence of spontaneous mutations and the recombination of resultant gene variants. Later, treatments with ionizing radiation or mutagenic chemicals facilitated dramatically increased mutation rates, which remarkably extended the genetic diversity of crop plants. However, a major drawback of conventionally induced mutagenesis is that genetic alterations occur simultaneously across the whole genome and at very high numbers per individual plant. By contrast, the newly emerging Cas endonuclease technology allows for the induction of mutations at user-defined positions in the plant genome. In fundamental and breeding-oriented research, this opens up unprecedented opportunities for the elucidation of gene functions and the targeted improvement of plant performance. This review covers historical aspects of the development of customizable endonucleases, information on the mechanisms of targeted genome modification, as well as hitherto reported applications of Cas endonuclease technology in barley and wheat that are the agronomically most important members of the temperate cereals. Finally, current trends in the further development of this technology and some ensuing future opportunities for research and biotechnological application are presented."

"32183058","abstracttext","Non-celiac wheat sensitivity (NCWS) is a recently recognized syndrome triggered by a gluten-containing diet. The pathophysiological mechanisms engaged in NCWS are poorly understood and, in the absence of laboratory markers, the diagnosis relies only on a double-blind protocol of symptoms evaluation during a gluten challenge. We aimed to shed light on the molecular mechanisms governing this disorder and identify biomarkers helpful to the diagnosis. By a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, we investigated gene expression profiles of the intestinal mucosa of 12 NCWS patients, as well as 7 controls. We identified 300 RNA transcripts whose expression differed between NCWS patients and controls. Only 37% of these transcripts were protein-coding RNA, whereas the remaining were non-coding RNA. Principal component analysis (PCA) and receiver operating characteristic curves showed that these microarray data are potentially useful to set apart NCWS from controls. Literature and network analyses indicated a possible implication/dysregulation of innate immune response, hedgehog pathway, and circadian rhythm in NCWS. This exploratory study indicates that NCWS can be genetically defined and gene expression profiling might be a suitable tool to support the diagnosis. The dysregulated genes suggest that NCWS may result from a deranged immune response. Furthermore, non-coding RNA might play an important role in the pathogenesis of NCWS."

"32179904","abstracttext","Straw return is widely applied to increase soil fertility and soil organic carbon storage. However, its effect on N2O emissions from paddy soil and the associated microbial mechanisms are still unclear. In this study, wheat straw was amended to two paddy soils (2% w/w) from Taizhou (TZ) and Yixing (YX), China, which were flooded and incubated for 30 d. Real-time PCR and Illumina sequencing were used to characterize changes in denitrifying functional gene abundance and denitrifying bacterial communities. Compared to unamended controls, straw addition significantly decreased accumulated N2O emissions in both TZ (5071 to 96 mg kg-1) and YX (1501 to 112 mg kg-1). This was mainly due to reduced N2O production with decreased abundance of major genera of nirK and nirS-bacterial communities and reduced nirK and nirS gene abundances. Further analyses showed that nirK-, nirS- and nosZ-bacterial community composition shifted mainly along the easily oxidizable carbon (EOC) arrows following straw amendment among four different soil organic carbon fractions, suggesting that increased EOC was the main driver of alerted denitrifying bacterial community composition. This study revealed straw return suppressed N2O emission via altering denitrifying bacterial community compositions and highlighted the importance of EOC in controlling denitrifying bacterial communities."

"32392904","abstracttext","Crop cultivars with larger root systems have an increased ability to absorb water and nutrients under conditions of water deficit. To unravel the molecular mechanism of water-stress tolerance in wheat, we performed RNA-seq analysis on the two genotypes, Colotana 296-52 (Colotana) and Tincurrin, contrasting the root growth under polyethylene-glycol-induced water-stress treatment. Out of a total of 35,047 differentially expressed genes, 3692 were specifically upregulated in drought-tolerant Colotana under water stress. Transcription factors, pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase and late-embryogenesis-abundant proteins were among upregulated genes in Colotana. Variant calling between Colotana and Tincurrin detected 15,207 SNPs and Indels, which may affect protein function and mediate the contrasting root length phenotype. Finally, the expression patterns of five triads in response to water, high-salinity, heat, and cold stresses were analyzed using qRT-PCR to see if there were differences in homoeologous gene expression in response to those conditions. The five examined triads showed variation in the contribution of homoeologous genes to water, high-salinity, heat, and cold stresses in the two genotypes. The variation of homoeologous gene expression in response to environmental stresses may enable plants to better cope with stresses in their natural environments."

"32518116","abstracttext","Recombination between homeologous chromosomes, also known as homeologous exchange (HE), plays a significant role in shaping genome structure and gene expression in interspecific hybrids and allopolyploids of several plant species. However, the molecular mechanisms that govern HEs are not well understood. Here, we studied HE events in the progeny of a nascent allotetraploid (genome AADD) derived from two diploid progenitors of hexaploid bread wheat using cytological and whole-genome sequence analyses. In total, 37 HEs were identified and HE junctions were mapped precisely. HEs exhibit typical patterns of homologous recombination hotspots, being biased toward low-copy, subtelomeric regions of chromosome arms and showing association with known recombination hotspot motifs. But, strikingly, while homologous recombination preferentially takes place upstream and downstream of coding regions, HEs are highly enriched within gene bodies, giving rise to novel recombinant transcripts, which in turn are predicted to generate new protein fusion variants. To test whether this is a widespread phenomenon, a dataset of high-resolution HE junctions was analyzed for allopolyploid Brassica , rice, Arabidopsis suecica , banana, and peanut. Intragenic recombination and formation of chimeric genes was detected in HEs of all species and was prominent in most of them. HE thus provides a mechanism for evolutionary novelty in transcript and protein sequences in nascent allopolyploids."

Therefore, reducing higher alcohols in alcoholic beverages is necessary. We used nitrogen compensation to reduce higher alcohols with Chinese rice wine as an experimental model. Higher alcohols including isobutyl alcohols, isoamyl alcohols, and β -phenethyl alcohols were significantly decreased by 19.27, 23.03 and 19.43%, respectively, when 200 mg/L (NH 4 ) 2 HPO 4 , 5% (w/v) yeast, and 11% wheat Koji were added to fermentation broth. Meanwhile, important quality parameters remained unchanged including free amino acids, organic acids, biogenic amines, and esters. The expression of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 gene ( GDH1 ) and glutamine synthetase gene ( GLN1 ) was significantly enhanced, 26.9- and 1.9-folds respectively. These results suggest that ammonium compensation could effectively decrease higher alcohols in Chinese rice wine by activating glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) pathway in ammonium assimilation."

"32484730","abstracttext","The plant-pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum , causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease on small grain cereals, produces toxic trichothecenes that require facilitated export for full virulence. Two potential modes of mycotoxin transport are membrane-bound transporters, which move toxins across cellular membranes, and N -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor (SNARE)-mediated vesicular transport, by which toxins may be packaged as cargo in vesicles bound for organelles or the plasma membrane. In this study, we show that deletion of a gene ( Sso2 ) for a subapically localized t-SNARE protein results in growth alteration, increased sensitivity to xenobiotics, altered gene expression profiles, and reduced deoxynivalenol (DON) accumulation in vitro and in planta as well as reduced FHB symptoms on wheat. A double deletion mutant generated by crossing the ∆sso2 deletion mutant with an ATP-binding cassette transporter deletion mutant ( ∆abc1 ) resulted in an additive reduction in DON accumulation and almost complete loss of FHB symptoms in planta. These results suggest an important role of Sso2-mediated subapical exocytosis in FHB progression and xenobiotic defense and are the first report of an additive reduction in F. graminearum DON accumulation upon deletion of two distinct modes of cellular export. This research provides useful information which may aid in formulating novel management plans of FHB or other destructive plant diseases."

"32481188","abstracttext","Flowering time is an important contributor to plant productivity and yield. Plants integrate flowering signals from a range of different internal and external cues in order to flower and set seed under optimal conditions. Networks of genes controlling flowering time have been uncovered in the flowering models Arabidopsis, wheat, barley and rice. Investigations have revealed important commonalities such as FT genes that promote flowering in all of these plants, as well as regulators that are unique to some of them. FT genes also have functions beyond floral promotion, including acting as floral repressors and having a complex role in woody polycarpic plants such as vines and trees. However, much less is known overall about flowering control in other important groups of plants such as the legumes. This review discusses recent efforts to uncover flowering-time regulators using candidate gene approaches or forward screens for spring early flowering mutants in the legume Medicago truncatula. The results highlight the importance of a Medicago FT gene, FTa1, in flowering-time control. However, the mechanisms by which FTa1 is regulated by environmental signals such as long days (photoperiod) and vernalisation (winter cold) appear to differ from Arabidopsis."

"32444783","abstracttext","It is currently uncertain to what extent genetic transformations of strategic crops (targeting diverse traits) have improved their N use efficiency (NUE), and what the key factors affecting their NUE are. Based on data collected from 130 publications, the effect sizes of genetic transformations and the key factors influencing NUE for three major cereal crops (rice, maize, and wheat), were investigated using a meta-analysis approach. Genetic transformations increased yield, shoot biomass, N uptake efficiency (NUpE), and partial factor productivity of N (PFPN) in the crops, but decreased shoot NUE (SNUE) and grain NUE (GNUE). Transporter genes improved yield and NUE parameters more efficiently, than did the other gene types. The effect sizes for some NUE parameters varied according to crop species and experimental conditions but did not differ between the overexpression and ectopic expression methods. Most effect sizes did not correlate with gene overexpression levels. These results indicate a promising potential of genetic transformations approaches for improving certain NUE parameters."

"30131572","abstracttext","The value of exotic wheat genetic resources for accelerating grain yield gains is largely unproven and unrealized. We used next-generation sequencing, together with multi-environment phenotyping, to study the contribution of exotic genomes to 984 three-way-cross-derived (exotic/elite1//elite2) pre-breeding lines (PBLs). Genomic characterization of these lines with haplotype map-based and SNP marker approaches revealed exotic specific imprints of 16.1 to 25.1%, which compares to theoretical expectation of 25%. A rare and favorable haplotype (GT) with 0.4% frequency in gene bank identified on chromosome 6D minimized grain yield (GY) loss under heat stress without GY penalty under irrigated conditions. More specifically, the 'T' allele of the haplotype GT originated in Aegilops tauschii and was absent in all elite lines used in study. In silico analysis of the SNP showed hits with a candidate gene coding for isoflavone reductase IRL-like protein in Ae. tauschii. Rare haplotypes were also identified on chromosomes 1A, 6A and 2B effective against abiotic/biotic stresses. Results demonstrate positive contributions of exotic germplasm to PBLs derived from crosses of exotics with CIMMYT's best elite lines. This is a major impact-oriented pre-breeding effort at CIMMYT, resulting in large-scale development of PBLs for deployment in breeding programs addressing food security under climate change scenarios."

Here, we describe a combined physical and genetic map derived from a cross between the drug-type strain Purple Kush and the hemp variety ""Finola."" The map reveals that cannabinoid biosynthesis genes are generally unlinked but that aromatic prenyltransferase ( AP ), which produces the substrate for THCA and CBDA synthases (THCAS and CBDAS), is tightly linked to a known marker for total cannabinoid content. We further identify the gene encoding CBCA synthase ( CBCAS ) and characterize its catalytic activity, providing insight into how cannabinoid diversity arises in cannabis. THCAS and CBDAS (which determine the drug vs. hemp chemotype) are contained within large (>250 kb) retrotransposon-rich regions that are highly nonhomologous between drug- and hemp-type alleles and are furthermore embedded within ∼40 Mb of minimally recombining repetitive DNA.

"30195381","abstracttext","Fungal resistance to fungicides is a serious challenge in crop protection. Although strategies have been found to prevent the development of fungicide resistance, rare strategy has been found to quickly reduce such resistance once it has occurred. We demonstrate that the application of dsRNAs, which inhibit the expression of the phenamacril (fungicide JS399-19) target gene-Myosin 5 (Myo5) in Fusarium, decreased F. asiaticum resistance to phenamacril and infection. RNAi molecules derived from different regions of Myo5 gene had different effects on phenamacril-resistance. Myo5-8 (one of Myo5 segments) exhibited great and stable effect on phenamacril-resistant reduction both in vivo and in vitro. Myo5 mRNA and protein were both reduced when mycelium was treated with Myo5-8 dsRNA. After a mixture of Myo5-8 dsRNA and phenamacril treatment, plants can highly control the infection of phenamacril-resistant strain. The antifungal activity of Myo5-8 dsRNA plus phenamacril effected longer than a single Myo5-8 dsRNA. In addition, no off-target sequences were found in wheat and/or other plant and animal species for Myo5-8 dsRNA sequence. Our findings suggest a new strategy for fungicide resistant reduction and for designing new fungicides to control pathogens which easily develop fungicide resistance."

"30781002","abstracttext","Previously, Mdm1, a gene controlling resistance to Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV), was identified in the inbred line Pa405. The gene was tightly linked to the restriction fragment length polymorphism marker umc85 on the short arm of chromosome 6. This chromosomal region is also the location of resistance genes to two other viruses in the family Potyviridae, Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) and Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV). A diverse collection of 115 maize inbred lines was evaluated for resistance to MDMV and SCMV, and for MDMV resistance loci on chromosome 6S. Forty-six resistant inbred lines were crossed to three MDMVsusceptible inbred lines to develop F 2 populations. The F 2 populations were inoculated with MDMV and scored for infection and symptom type. Environmental factors influenced both the rate and type of symptom development. Bulked segregant analysis of each F 2 population indicated that, in 42 of 43 MDMV-resistant lines, chromosome 6S markers found in the resistant parent also were present in the bulked resistant but not the susceptible tissue. Markers previously associated with resistance to both SCMV and WSMV on chromosome 3 and to WSMV on chromosome 10 were associated with resistance in nine and seven of the F 2 populations, respectively. These data suggest that Mdm1 or closely linked genes on chromosome 6S are associated with MDMV resistance in most germplasm, but that other loci also may affect resistance."

"30857621","abstracttext","Acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor-resistant biotypes are the fastest growing class of herbicide-resistant weeds. Shepherd's purse (Capsella bursa-pastoris (L.) Medik.), a tetraploid species and one of the most troublesome weeds in wheat production, has evolved ALS inhibitor resistance. To confirm and characterize the resistance of shepherd's purse populations to ALS-inhibiting herbicides, whole-plant bioassays were conducted. To investigate the molecular basis of resistance in shepherd's purse, the ALS gene was sequenced and compared between susceptible (S) and resistant (R) biotypes. Two partial intronless ALS genes (ALS-1 and ALS-2) were identified, and two heterozygous mutations (CCT to TCT in ALS-1 and CCT to CAT in ALS-2) at position 197 (Pro197Ser and Pro197His) providing resistance were simultaneously found in a single plant in a resistant population. Our results confirmed that the resistant shepherd's purse population showed high-level resistance to tribenuron-methyl (RI = 59.8), pyroxsulam (RI = 38.7) and flucarbazone-Na (RI = 88.0). Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results suggested that the difference in ALS gene expression was small between S and R populations, which may be insufficient to cause herbicide resistance, and according to the results of in vitro ALS activity, insensitivity of ALS may be the main mechanism of high resistance to tribenuron-methyl in resistant populations."

"30274246","abstracttext","An understanding of the genes and mechanisms regulating environmental stress in crops is critical for boosting agricultural yield and safeguarding food security. Under adverse conditions, response pathways are activated for tolerance or resistance. In multiple species, the alternative oxidase ( AOX ) genes encode proteins which help in this process. Recently, this gene family has been extensively investigated in the vital crop plants, wheat, barley and rice. Cumulatively, these three species and/or their wild ancestors contain the genes for AOX1a , AOX1c , AOX1e , and AOX1d , and common patterns in the protein isoforms have been documented. Here, we add more information on these trends by emphasizing motifs that could affect expression, and by utilizing the most recent discoveries from the AOX isoform in Trypanosoma brucei to highlight clade-dependent biases. The new perspectives may have implications on how the AOX gene family has evolved and functions in monocots. The common or divergent amino acid substitutions between these grasses and the parasite are noted, and the potential effects of these changes are discussed. There is the hope that the insights gained will inform the way future AOX research is performed in monocots, in order to optimize crop production for food, feed, and fuel."
"30307098","articletitle","A novel citrate synthase isoform contributes infection and stress resistance of the stripe rust fungus."
"30307098","abstracttext","The early development of a rust fungus is dependent on the endogenous lipids stored in the urediniospores. After it establishes a parasitic relationship with the host, sugars absorbed from the host cells by haustoria become the primary nutrients. The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle is essential to oxidize these nutrients. However, few studies have addressed the role of citrate synthase (CS), a rate-limiting enzyme of the TCA cycle, during the infection process of rust fungi. In this study, a CS gene from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), PsCS1, was cloned and characterized. Transcripts of PsCS1 and the enzyme activity of the CS were increased in the early Pst infection stage. Biochemical features and subcellular localization revealed that PsCS1 encoded a mitochondrial CS. Size exclusion chromatography, yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments confirmed that PsCS1 could form a functional homo-octamer. The overexpression of PsCS1 enhanced the resistance of Escherichia coli to salt stress. The knockdown of PsCS1 using a host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) system blocked Pst growth in wheat. These results indicate that PsCS1 is required for nutrient metabolism in Pst and contributes to Pst infection by regulating ATP production and the supply of carbon sources."

"30642485","abstracttext","Wild blueberry pomace extract complexed with wheat or chickpea flour or soy protein isolate produced spray dried and freeze-dried polyphenol-protein particles. To evaluate the impact of spray drying on the biological activity of these food ingredients in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, regulation of glucose metabolism and ability to stimulate fibroblast migration were tested. Extracts from polyphenol-protein particles significantly decreased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and down-regulated the gene expression of inflammation markers (COX-2 and IL-1β). Milder suppression of nitric oxide production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression was evident. The extracts significantly inhibited phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and accelerated fibroblast cell migration up to 3-fold after 24 h. Complexed polyphenols retained their structural integrity and bioactive potency for both lyophilized and spray dried treatments. The data suggests that spray drying is a convenient and cost-effective technique to produce blueberry-polyphenol food ingredients with preserved phytochemicals with biological activities."
"30359739","articletitle","Identification of novel C-repeat binding factor (CBF) genes in rye (Secale cereale L.) and expression studies."
"30359739","abstracttext","Although rye is one of the most cold-tolerant species among temperate cereals, its huge and complex genome has prevented us from identifying agronomically useful genes. However, advances in high-throughput sequencing technology are making it increasingly possible to investigate its genome. The C-repeat binding factor (CBF) gene family controls cold tolerance in plants and its members are well conserved among eudicots and monocots, among which there are diverse homologs. Despite its large genome, only a small number of CBF genes have been identified in rye. In this study, we explored high-throughput sequencing data of the rye genome and identified 12 novel CBF genes. Sequence analyses revealed that these genes contain signature sequences of the CBF family. Chromosomal localization of the genes by PCR using wheat-rye addition lines showed that most of these are located on the long arm of chromosome 5, but also on the long arm of chromosomes 2 and 6. On the basis of comparative analyses of CBF family members in the Triticeae, CBF proteins were divided into several groups according to phylogenetic relationship and conserved motifs. Light is essential to fully induce CBF gene expression and there is specificity in the response to different types of abiotic stresses in ScCBF genes. The results of our study will assist investigations of CBF genes in the Triticeae and the mechanism of cold tolerance through the CBF-dependent pathway in plants."
"30622636","articletitle","Genetic diversity and relationship between domesticated rye and its wild relatives as revealed through genotyping-by-sequencing."
"30622636","abstracttext","Rye ( Secale cereale L.) is a cereal grass that is an important food crop in Central and Eastern Europe. In contrast to its close relatives wheat and barley, it was not a founder crop of Neolithic agriculture, but is considered a secondary domesticate that may have become a crop plant only after a transitory phase as a weed. As a minor crop of only local importance, genomic resources in rye are underdeveloped, and few population genetic studies using genomewide markers have been published to date. We collected genotyping-by-sequencing data for 603 individuals from 101 genebank accessions of domesticated rye and its wild progenitor S. cereale subsp. vavilovii and related species in the genus Secale . Variant detection in the context of a recently published draft sequence assembly of cultivated rye yielded 55,744 single nucleotide polymorphisms with present genotype calls in 90% of samples. Analysis of population structure recapitulated the taxonomy of the genus Secale . We found only weak genetic differentiation between wild and domesticated rye with likely gene flow between the two groups. Moreover, incomplete lineage sorting was frequent between Secale species because of either ongoing gene flow or recent speciation. Our study highlights the necessity of gauging the representativeness of ex situ germplasm collections for domestication studies and motivates a more in-depth analysis of the interplay between sequence divergence and reproductive isolation in the genus Secale ."

"30699610","abstracttext","Leaf rust and stripe rust are important diseases of wheat and can be controlled by growing resistant varieties. We investigated the genetic basis of resistance to both rusts in 198 F 5 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between 'Avocet' and 'Francolin#1'. The population was phenotyped in greenhouse and field, and genotyped with known gene-associated molecular markers. Seedling resistance of Francolin#1 to leaf and stripe rusts was attributed to the loosely linked genes Lr16 and YrF, respectively, with a recombination frequency of 0.36. Field segregation indicated that adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf and stripe rusts was conferred by three and five additive genes, respectively. Among them, Lr46/Yr29 was associated with resistance to both rusts in Francolin#1, Lr16 reduced field leaf rust severity by 8 to 9%, and YrF contributed to 10 to 25% reductions in stripe rust severity. The Lr16 region was also associated with a 5 to 16% reduction in stripe rust severity, which is likely due to its linkage with YrF or another unidentified stripe rust APR gene. Significant additive effects on stripe rust were detected between YrF and Yr29. We conclude that APR in Francolin#1 to leaf and stripe rusts involves a combination of seedling and APR genes."

"30722230","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most destructive plant diseases in China. Gansu and Ningxia Provinces are considered to be the key areas for over-summering of this pathogen in China. In this study, 283 P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates were collected in these two provinces. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) was used to analyze the population genetics and to infer the chance of population exchanges between different geographic locations and seasons. The genotypic diversity of the Gansu population (0.514) was slightly higher than that of the Ningxia population (0.489). The occurrence of frequent population exchanges between these two regions was observed, showing that 40 AFLP genotypes were shared by the populations of the two provinces. Gene flow between these two regions in autumn and spring subpopulations was also detected. The genotype distribution in three populations of Ningxia from opposite sides of the Liupan Mountains revealed possible significant effects of the mountains on limiting gene flow and population exchange. Phylogenetic analysis confirmed the possibility of recombination in some of the studied subpopulations in both provinces."

"31820048","abstracttext","This study reports the evolutionary history and in-silico functional characterization of a novel water-deficit and ABA-responsive gene in wheat. This gene has remote sequence similarity to known abiotic stress-related genes in different plants, including CAP160 in Spinacia oleracea, RD29B in Arabidopsis thaliana, and CDeT11-24 in Craterostigma plantagineum. The study investigated if these genes form a close homologous relationship or if they are a result of convergent evolutionary processes. The results indicated a closely shared homologous relationship between these genes. Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences of the remotely related CAP160 proteins from various plant species indicated the presence of three distinct clades. Further analyses indicated that CAP160 homologous genes have predominantly evolved through neutral processes, with multiple regions experiencing signatures of purifying selection, while others were indicated to be the result of episodic diversifying selection events. Functional predictions revealed that these genes might share at least two functions related to abiotic stress conditions: one similar to the cryoprotective function of LEA protein, and the other a signalling molecule with phosphatidic acid binding specificity. Studies focused on the identification of cold-responsive genes are essential for the development of cold-tolerant crop plants, if we are to increase agricultural productivity throughout temperate regions."

"31805731","abstracttext","A doubled haploid population of 94 lines from the Chinese Spring × SQ1 wheat cross (CSDH) was used to evaluate additive and epistatic gene action effects on total phenolic content, grain yield of the main stem, grain number per plant, thousand grain weight, and dry weight per plant at harvest based on phenotypic and genotypic observations of CSDH lines. These traits were evaluated under moderate and severe drought stress and compared with well-watered plants. Plants were grown in pots in an open-sided greenhouse. Genetic parameters, such as additive and epistatic effects, affecting total phenolic content, were estimated for eight year-by-drought combinations. Twenty-one markers showed a significant additive effect on total phenolic content in all eight year-by-drought combinations. These markers were located on chromosomes: 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 3A, 3B, 3D, 4A, and 4D. A region on 4AL with a stable QTL controlling the phenolic content, confirmed by various statistical methods is particularly noteworthy. In all years and treatments, three markers significantly linked to QTLs have been identified for both phenols and yield. Thirteen markers were coincident with candidate genes. Our results indicated the importance of both additive and epistatic gene effects on total phenolic content in eight year-by-drought combinations."

"31737001","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium pathogens are devastating diseases worldwide. Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) which involves host expression of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-generating constructs directed against genes in the pathogen has been a potential strategy for the ecological sound control of FHB. In this study, we constructed transgenic Brachypodium distachyon lines carrying RNA interference (RNAi) cassettes to target two essential protein kinase genes Fg00677 and Fg08731 , and cytochrome P450 lanosterol C14-α-demethylase (CYP51) encoding genes ( CYP51A , CYP51B , and CYP51C ) of Fusarium graminearum , respectively. Northern blotting confirmed the presence of short interfering RNAs (siRNA) derived from Fg00677 , Fg08731 , and CYP51 in transgenic B. distachyon plants, and the transcript levels of the corresponding genes were down-regulated in the F. graminearum colonizing B. distachyon spikes. All the corresponding independent, Fg00677 -RNAi, Fg08731 -RNAi, and CYP51 -RNAi transgenic T2 lines exhibited strong resistance to F. graminearum , suggesting that silencing molecules produced by transgenic plants inhibited the corresponding gene function by down-regulating its expression, thereby reducing pathogenicity. Our results indicate that Fg00677 and Fg08731 are effective targets for HIGS and can be applied to construct transgenic HIGS materials to enhance FHB resistance in wheat and other cereal crops."

"31378346","abstracttext","Lithospermum arvense is a troublesome dicotyledonous winter annual weed of wheat in China. A L. arvense population (HN01) suspected of being resistant to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitors was found in Henan Province, China. This study aimed to testify the sensitivity of this HN01 population to eight herbicides from 3 different modes of action, and to explore the potential target-site-resistance mechanism to tribenuron-methyl. The whole-plant bioassays indicated that the population was highly resistant to tribenuron-methyl (SU, 350-fold), pyrithiobac sodium (PTB, 151-fold), pyroxsulam (TP, 62.7-fold), florasulam (TP, 80.6-fold), and imazethapyr (IMI, 136-fold), but was sensitive to carfentrazone-ethyl and fluroxypyr-meptyl. ALS gene sequencing revealed that the Trp (TGG) was substituted by Leu (TTG) at codon 574 in resistant plants. In in vitro ALS assays, the concentration of tribenuron-methyl required to inhibit 50% ALS activity (I 50 ) for HN01 was 117-fold greater than that required to inhibit a susceptible population (HN05), indicating that resistance was due to reduced sensitivity of the ALS enzyme to tribenuron-methyl. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of ALS gene Trp-574-Leu amino acid mutation confer resistance to tribenuron-methyl in L. arvense."

"31402758","abstracttext","Transposable elements (TEs) are found almost in all living organism, shaping organisms' genomes. miRNAs are noncoding RNA types which are especially important in gene expression regulations. Many previously determined plant miRNAs are identical/homologous to transposons (TE-MIR). The aim of this study was computational characterization of novel TE-related miRNAs and their targets in Aegilops genome by using stringent criteria. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were performed by BLAST2GO. Seventeen novel TE-related miRNAs in Aegilops genome were identified for the first time. GO analyses indicated that 40 targets played different roles in biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions. Moreover, these genes were involved in 10 metabolic pathways such as purine metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, etc. as a result of KEGG analyses. Identification of miRNAs and their targets are significant to understand miRNA-TEs relationships and even how TEs affect plant growth and development. Obtaining results of this study are expected to provide possible new insight into Aegilops and its related species, wheat, with respect to miRNAs evolution and domestication.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

"31254100","abstracttext_main conclusion","Site-specific changes of photosynthesis, a relatively new concept, can be used to improve the productivity of critical food crops to mitigate the foreseen food crisis. Global food security is threatened by an increasing population and the effects of climate change. Large yield improvements were achieved in major cereal crops between the 1950s and 1980s through the Green Revolution. However, we are currently experiencing a significant decline in yield progress. Of the many approaches to improved cereal yields, exploitation of the mode of photosynthesis has been intensely studied. Even though the C 4 pathway is considered the most efficient, mainly because of the carbon concentrating mechanisms around the enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, which minimize photorespiration, much is still unknown about the specific gene regulation of this mode of photosynthesis. Most of the critical cereal crops, including wheat and rice, are categorized as C 3 plants based on the photosynthesis of major photosynthetic organs. However, recent findings raise the possibility of different modes of photosynthesis occurring at different sites in the same plant and/or in plants grown in different habitats. That is, it seems possible that efficient photosynthetic traits may be expressed in specific organs, even though the major photosynthetic pathway is C 3 . Knowledge of site-specific differences in photosynthesis, coupled with site-specific regulation of gene expression, may therefore hold a potential to enhance the yields of economically important C 3 crops."

First, a six-gene cluster, including XYL1 / XYL2 / XKS1 / TAL1 / PYK1 / MGT05196 , was generated by using an in-depth two-stage (glucose and xylose) transcription reprogramming strategy in an evolutionary adapted strain of CE7, resulting in two improved engineered strains WXY46 and WXY53. Through a combined screening of xylose and glucose stage-specific promoters between tricarboxylic acid (TCA)/HSP and constitutive types, respectively, WXY46 with the constitutive promoters showed a much higher ethanol yield than that of WXY53 with the TCA/HSP promoters. Second, an optimized strain WXY74 was obtained by using more copies of a six-gene cluster, which resulted in a higher ethanol yield of 0.500 g/g total sugars with acetate conditions. At last, simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation were performed by using the evolved WXY74 strain, which produced 58.4 g/L of ethanol from wheat straw waste and outperformed previous haploid XR-XDH strains."

The involvement of these enzymes was studied in the model organism Brachypodium distachyon (L.)P.Beauv. Bd21 and in its derivative Bd21-3, a more drought tolerant line. Osmotic stress treatment resulted in a decrease in the water potential of both Brachypodium genotypes, the difference between the control and treated plant's ψw decreased by the last sampling day in Bd21-3, suggesting some degree of adaptation to the applied osmotic stress. Increased GST activity revealed a severe defence reaction against the harmful imbalance of the redox environment. Screening for the gene sequences led to the identification of 91 full-length or partial GST sequences. Although purple false brome has a relatively small genome, the number of identified GST genes was almost as high as the number predicted in wheat. The estimation of GST expression showed stress-induced differences: higher expression levels or the fast induction of BdGSTF8, BdGSTU35 and BdGSTU42 gene products presumably indicate a strong detoxification under osmotic stress."

In this study, a double haploid (DH) population was developed from a cross between XuBYDV (introduced from China showing very good resistance to BYD) and H-120 (a BYD-sensitive Chinese accession), and was used to identify QTL for BYD resistance. The population was genotyped using an Infinium iSelect bead chip array targeting 90K gene-based SNPs. The disease resistance of DH lines inoculated with BYDV was assessed at the heading stage. The infections were assessed by tissue blot immunoassay (TBIA). Three new QTL were identified on chromosomes 5A, 6A, and 7A for both symptom and TBIA, with all three resistance alleles being inherited from XuBYDV. Some DH lines with the resistance alleles from all three QTL showed high level resistance to BYD. These new QTL will be useful in breeding programs for pyramiding BYD resistance genes."

F 2 and F 3 populations derived from a Matlabas × Line 37-07 cross segregated for a single resistance gene to race TTKSF that is avirulent to Matlabas. In screening genomic DNA bulks of susceptible or resistant F 2 plants with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, three chromosome arm 2BS markers and one multilocus marker amplified alleles present only in the resistant bulks and Matlabas. Additional 2B-specific SSR markers, incorporating markers spanning regions containing Sr9h , SrWLR , Sr28 , and Sr47 , were screened in the parental lines and mapped in the F 2 population. Linkage and QTL mapping showed that the gene is located between Xbarc160 in the centromeric region and Xgwm47 on the long arm of chromosome 2B. When 2B-specific SNP markers were mapped, the area of interest was delimited to a 15.3 cM region on chromosome arm 2BL, with XIWA543-HRM and Xgwm47 as flanking loci. Matlabas, Webster, and related Sr9h lines all produced a similar, low infection type to race TTKSF, but were susceptible to race TTKSF+. Phenotypic data and allelic studies suggested that stem rust resistance in Matlabas was derived from an Sr9h source."

Total genetic diversity (HT) and polymorphic information content (PIC) were 0.36 and 0.30 respectively for both landraces and modern cultivars. Linkage disequilibrium for the modern cultivars was higher than for the landraces (0.18 and 0.12, respectively). Analysis of the genetic structure showed a clear geographical pattern for the landraces, which were clustered into three subpopulations (SPs) representing the western, northern and eastern Mediterranean, whereas the modern cultivars were structured according to the breeding programmes that developed them: CIMMYT/ICARDA, France/Italy, and Balkan/eastern European countries. The modern cultivars showed higher genetic differentiation (GST) and lower gene flow (0.1673 and 2.49, respectively) than the landraces (0.1198 and 3.67, respectively), indicating a better distinction between subpopulations. The maximum gene flow was observed between landraces from the northern Mediterranean SPs and the modern cultivars released mainly by French and Italian breeding programmes."

High generation stability was achieved by almost no gene lost after six generations but Chd activity decreased. aprE promoter alteration, translation initiation region modification and multi-copy chromosome integration were studied and these modifications could increase Chd activity by 270%, 2304% and 25%. Chlorothalonil residual exhibited inhibition on bioconversion of lignocellulosic biomass. The addition of Chd crude enzyme (60 μL per g wheat straw) could increase glucose production by 36.10% and 39.65% in synergistic hydrolysis and separate hydrolysis by laccase and cellulase with 120 mg/L residual chlorothalonil. Filter paper activity and carboxymethyl cellulase activity were enhanced by 12.84% and 23.95%, and biomass of Trichoderma reesei was increased by 76.67% under 50 μg chlorothalonil/g dry straw in solid-state fermentation. Thus, the high-level stable expressed Chd effectively eliminated chlorothalonil inhibition on enzymatic hydrolysis and solid-state fermentation. It showed promising potential for bioremediation of chlorothalonil pollution and improving conversion efficiency of lignocellulose."

"33042084","abstracttext","Most species live in a variable environment in nature. Yet understanding the evolutionary processes underlying molecular adaptation to fluctuations remains a challenge. In this study we investigate the transcriptome of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici after experimental evolution under stable or fluctuating temperature, by comparing ancestral and evolved populations simultaneously. We found that temperature regimes could have a large and pervasive effect on the transcriptome evolution, with as much as 38% of the genes being differentially expressed between selection regimes. Although evolved lineages showed different changes of gene expression based on ancestral genotypes, we identified a set of genes responding specifically to fluctuation. We found that transcriptome evolution in fluctuating conditions was repeatable between parallel lineages initiated from the same genotype for about 60% of the differentially expressed genes. Further, we detected several hotspots of significantly differentially expressed genes in the genome, in regions known to be enriched in repetitive elements, including accessory chromosomes. Our findings also evidenced gene expression evolution toward a gain of robustness (loss of phenotypic plasticity) associated with the fluctuating regime, suggesting robustness is adaptive in changing environment. This work provides valuable insight into the role of transcriptional rewiring for rapid adaptation to abiotic changes in filamentous plant pathogens."

Tibetan wild barley germplasm is a valuable source of potential genes for breeding barley with acid and Al tolerance. We performed microRNA and RNA sequencing using wild (XZ16, Al-tolerant; XZ61, Al-sensitive) and cultivated (Dayton, Al-tolerant) barley. A novel homeobox-leucine zipper transcription factor, HvHOX9, was identified as a target gene of miR166b and functionally characterized. HvHOX9 was up-regulated by Al stress in XZ16 (but unchanged in XZ61 and Dayton) and was significantly induced only in root tip. Phylogenetic analysis showed that HvHOX9 is most closely related to wheat TaHOX9 and orthologues of HvHOX9 are present in the closest algal relatives of Zygnematophyceae. Barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing of HvHOX9 in XZ16 led to significantly increased Al sensitivity but did not affect its sensitivity to other metals and low pH. Disruption of HvHOX9 did not change Al concentration in the root cell sap, but led to more Al accumulation in root cell wall after Al exposure. Silencing of HvHOX9 decreased H+ influx after Al exposure. Our findings suggest that miR166b/HvHOX9 play a critical role in Al tolerance by decreasing root cell wall Al binding and increasing apoplastic pH for Al detoxification in the root."

"32719425","abstracttext","Barley (Hordeum vulgare) awns contribute to grain yield, but the genetic basis of awn development remains largely unclear. Five barley lines differing in awn traits and row types were used to create four F 2 populations. Genetic analyses revealed that four pairs of genes were involved in awn development: A/a (awnless/awned), B/b (awnless/awned), H/h (hooded/straight), and L/l (long/short). Of these four loci, A, H and L functioned on both central rows (CR) and lateral rows (LR) of the barley spikes, while B exhibited effect only on LR. A and B had duplicate effects on LR, and both showed dominant epistasis to loci H and L, whereas H was epistatic to L. Meanwhile, A and B were found to be genetically linked, with a row-type locus V located between them. The genetic distances of A-V and B-V were estimated to be 9.6 and 7.7 cM, respectively. Literature search suggested that A, H and V may correspond to the reported Lks1, Kap1 and Vrs1, respectively, whereas B is a novel gene specifically controlling awn development on LR, designated as Lsa1 for lateral spikelet awnless 1. The only barley homolog of wheat awn inhibitor gene B1, HORVU2Hr1G077570, is a potential candidate of Lsa1."

"32994429","abstracttext","Factors influencing production of greenhouse gases nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and nitrogen (N 2 ) in arable soils include high nitrate, moisture and plants; we investigate how differences in the soil microbiome due to antecedent soil treatment additionally influence denitrification. Microbial communities, denitrification gene abundance and gas production in soils from tilled arable plots with contrasting fertilizer inputs (no N, mineral N, FYM) and regenerated woodland in the long-term Broadbalk field experiment were investigated. Soil was transferred to pots, kept bare or planted with wheat and after 6 weeks, transferred to sealed chambers with or without K 15 NO 3 fertilizer for 4 days; N 2 O and N 2 were measured daily. Concentrations of N 2 O were higher when fertilizer was added, lower in the presence of plants, whilst N 2 increased over time and with plants. Prior soil treatment but not exposure to N-fertiliser or plants during the experiment influenced denitrification gene (nirK, nirS, nosZI, nosZII) relative abundance. Under our experimental conditions, denitrification generated mostly N 2 ; N 2 O was around 2% of total gaseous N 2  + N 2 O. Prior long-term soil management influenced the soil microbiome and abundance of denitrification genes. The production of N 2 O was driven by nitrate availability and N 2 generation increased in the presence of plants."
"33277993","articletitle","Diversity of Plant Heat Shock Factors: Regulation, Interactions and Functions."
"33277993","abstracttext","Plants Heat Shock Factors (HSFs) are encoded by large gene families with variable structure, expression and function. HSFs are components of complex signaling systems which control responses not only to high temperatures but also to a number of abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, hypoxic conditions, soil salinity, toxic minerals, strong irradiation and to pathogen threats. Here we provide an overview of the diverse world of plant HSFs through compilation and analysis of their functional versatility, diverse regulation and interactions. Bioinformatic data on gene expression profiles of Arabidopsis HSF genes were re-analysed to reveal their characteristic transcript patterns. While HSFs are regulated primarily at the transcript level, alternative splicing and posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation and sumoylation provides further variability. Plant HSFs are involved in an intricate web of protein-protein interactions which adds considerable complexity to their biological function. A list of such interactions was compiled from public databases, published data and discussed to pinpoint their relevance in transcription control. Although most fundamental studies of plant HSFs have been conducted in the model plant, Arabidopsis, information on HSFs is accumulating in other plants such as tomato, rice, wheat and sunflower.. Understanding the function, interactions and regulation of HSFs will facilitate the design of novel strategies to use engineered proteins to improve tolerance and adaptation of crops to adverse environmental conditions."

"7999119","abstracttext","Many cell surface receptors contain covalently linked carbohydrates recognizable by lectins. This study examined the feasibility of using lectins as gene delivery vectors. Polylysine (PL) and histone (His) conjugates of concanavalin A (Con A), Maackia amurensis agglutinin (MAA), Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA), and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), were employed to deliver pCMVlacZ to human airway epithelial cells (CFT1). As compared to the control (= 1.0), the beta-galactosidase activities expressed in CFT1 cells transfected with lectin-PL/His-DNA containing 5 micrograms/ml conjugate and 10 micrograms/ml DNA were: Con A-His, 7.7; SNA-His, 3.5; Con A-PL, 2.4; WGA-PL/His, 1.3; others, 1.0. The efficiency of gene transfer directed by Con A-His was dose dependent between 2.5 and 10 micrograms/ml of the conjugate. The maximal beta-galactosidase activity expressed relative to the control was 42 obtained using 10 micrograms/ml conjugate. These results demonstrate that lectin-PL/His conjugates can be used as vectors to transfer genes to airway epithelial cells."

"7800488","abstracttext","EmBP-1 is a wheat DNA binding protein of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) class of transcription factors implicated in the mechanisms of abscisic acid mediated gene activation. Understanding the role of EmBP-1 in regulating gene transcription requires elucidation of its DNA binding specificity. The binding of EmBP-1 was studied using gel shift selection of DNA from random sequence pools. DNA binding sites were identified by sequencing of a selected pool and by cloning and sequencing individual sites. The binding sites were compared by mobility shift assay and DNase I footprinting, which show that EmBP-1 binds to a family of sequences with varying degrees of affinity. The highest affinity site bound by EmBP-1 is the palindrome GCCACGTGGC. EmBP-1 also binds several other sequences with high affinity, however most of these are asymmetric. While nearly all sequences bound by EmBP-1 contain an ACGT core sequence, EmBP-1 can also bind at least two sites with altered cores. These results provide a basis for comparing the DNA binding specificity of EmBP-1 with those of other plant bZIP proteins and provide insight into the possible target sites which EmBP-1 might bind in vivo."

"18421588","abstracttext","The gene encoding a glycoside hydrolase family 39 xylosidase (BH1068) from the alkaliphile Bacillus halodurans strain C-125 was cloned with a C-terminal His-tag, and the recombinant gene product termed BH1068(His)(6) was expressed in Escherichia coli. Of the artificial substrates tested, BH1068(His)(6) hydrolyzed nitrophenyl derivatives of beta-D-xylopyranose, alpha-L-arabinofuranose, and alpha-L-arabinopyranose. Deviation from Michaelis-Menten kinetics at higher substrate concentrations indicative of transglycosylation was observed, and k (cat) and K (m) values were measured at both low and high substrate concentrations to illuminate the relative propensities to proceed along this alternate reaction pathway. The pH maximum was 6.5, and under the conditions tested, maximal activity was at 47 degrees C, and thermal instability occurred above 45 degrees C. BH1068(His)(6) was inactive on arabinan, hydrolyzed xylooligosaccharides, and released only xylose from oat, wheat, rye, beech, and birch arabinoxylan, and thus, can be classified as a xylosidase with respect to natural substrate specificity. The enzyme was not inhibited by up to 200 mM xylose. The oligomerization state was tetrameric under the size-exclusion chromatography conditions employed."

"18469981","abstracttext","Genetic linkage maps based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms are useful for many purposes; however, different populations are required to fulfill different objectives. Clones from the linkage map(s) are subsequently probed onto populations developed for special purposes such as gene tagging. Therefore, clones contained on the initial map(s) must be polymorphic on a wide range of genotypes to have maximum utility. The objectives of this research were to (i) calculate polymorphism information content values of 51 low-copy DNA clones and (ii) use the resulting values to choose potential mapping parents. Polymorphism information content was calculated using gene diversity by classifying restriction fragment patterns on a diverse set of 18 wheat genotypes. Combinations of potential parents were then compared by examining both the proportion of polymorphic clones and the likelihood that those mapped clones would give a polymorphism when used on other populations. Genotype pairs were identified that would map more highly informative DNA clones compared with a population derived from the most polymorphic potential parents. The methodologies used to characterize clones and rank potential parents should be applicable to other species and types of markers as well."

The yield of total extracellular phytase activity was 17.6 U/ml induced in Buffered Methanol-complex Medium (BMMY) and 18.5 U/ml in Wheat Bran Extract Induction (WBEI) medium at the flask scale, respectively, improving over 90 folds compared with the wild-type isolate. Purified enzyme showed temperature optimum of 70 degrees and pH optimum of 7.5. The enzyme activity retained 97% of the relative activity after incubation at 80 degrees for 5 min. Because of the heavy glycosylation the expressed phytase had a molecular size of approximately 51 kDa. After deglycosylation by endoglycosylase H (EndoH(f)), the enzyme had an apparent molecular size of 42 kDa. Its property and thermostability was affected by the glycosylation."

"17348672","abstracttext","An alteration in the secondary metabolism of maize (Zea mays L.) genetically modified with the wheat oxalate oxidase (OxO) gene was observed using HPLC and fluorescence microscopy. Phenolic concentrations in the OxO lines were significantly increased, but DIMBOA synthesis was reduced due to a diversion in the shikimate pathway leading to phenolic and hydroxamic acids. Ferulic acid exhibited the largest increase and accounted for 80.4% of the total soluble phenolics. Transcription of a 13-lipoxygenase gene, coding for a key enzyme involved in the regulation of secondary metabolism, was substantially higher in the OxO line than in the null line. To test whether the high levels of soluble phenolic acids, in particular ferulic acid, contributed to the insect resistance in the OxO maize, ferulic acid was administered in meridic diets to European corn borer (ECB). A significant negative correlation between ferulic acid concentration and ECB larval growth rate was found. Field testing during 2001 showed that OxO maize was more resistant to ECB, with leaf consumption and stalk-tunneling damage significantly reduced by 28-34 and 37-39%, respectively, on all of the OxO lines tested and confirming published 2000 findings."

A total of 315 fungal isolates from Texas, Oregon, and Switzerland were analyzed using seven nuclear RFLP probes that hybridized to discrete loci and purified mitochondrial DNA that hybridized to the entire mtDNA genome. Forty-two different mitochondrial haplotypes and 298 different nuclear haplotypes were detected. The two most frequent mtDNA haplotypes were present in every population and represented 32% of all isolates. High levels of gene flow, low levels of population subdivision, no evidence for either host specificity or cyto-nuclear disequilibrium were inferred from the analysis of both genomes. The concordance in estimates of these population genetic parameters from both genomes suggests that the two genomes experienced similar degrees of migration, genetic drift and selection."

"17075706","abstracttext","CBF/DREB1 proteins are the most important regulators of the cold temperature signaling pathway in many plants. CBF genes are candidates for low-temperature tolerance QTL in wheat and barley. Ten novel putative CBF cDNAs of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) have been isolated from cold-treated leaf tissue. Their primary structures contain some conserved motifs, characteristic of the gene class. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that LpCBF genes were attributable to the HvCBF3-, and HvCBF4-subgroups following the previously proposed classification of barley CBF genes. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression of LpCBF genes was rapidly induced in response to low temperature and that the expression pattern under the low-temperature conditions for a long period was different between the various LpCBF genes. Five of the ten LpCBF genes were assigned to the genetic linkage map using the p150/112 reference mapping population. LpCBFIb, LpCBFII, LpCBFIIIb and LpCBFIIIc were mapped on LG5 forming a cluster within 2.2 cM, while LpCBFVb was located on LG1. Based on comparative genetic studies, conserved synteny for CBF gene family was observed between the Triticeae cereals and perennial ryegrass. Information on the perennial ryegrass CBF genes at both the molecular and genetic level obtained in this study would be useful for the further study on the role of CBF genes and low-temperature tolerance in grasses."

"19116166","abstracttext","Pleurotus eryngii and P. ferulae, two species belonging to the P. eryngii complex, synthesize laccases, ligninolytic enzymes that play a role in the host-pathogen interaction in the first step of infection. Ecological studies have shown that although both fungi have been recognized as saprophytes, P. eryngii weakly pathogenic when colonizing the roots and stems of Eryngium campestre, whereas P. ferulae is mostly pathogenic to Ferula communis. The paper describes the genomic organization of four putative laccase genes (lac1, lac2, lac3, and lac5-like gene; gene names were assigned on the basis of sequence homologies) of P. eryngii and P. ferulae. The mRNA expression and enzymatic activity of the laccases were analysed under culture conditions where a source of lignin (wheat bran) or lyophilized roots of E. campestre or F. communis were present. These experiments indicated that the four lac-like genes were differentially regulated in the two mushrooms. Specifically, the addition of the lyophilized roots of the respective host plant to the culture media induced an advance in the mRNA expression of the four lac-like genes and a seven-fold higher total laccase activity in P. ferulae than in P. eryngii. The results obtained are discussed in relation to the possible role of laccases in the interaction of P. eryngii and P. ferulae with their respective host."

"19330313","abstracttext","Lesion mimics (LM) that resemble plant disease symptoms in the absence of plant pathogens may confer enhanced plant disease resistance to a wide range of pathogens. Wheat line Ning7840 has adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and shows LM symptoms at heading. A recessive gene (lm) was found to be responsible for LM in Ning7840 and located near the proximal region of chromosome 1BL using a population of 179 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from the cross Ning7840/Chokwang. Genomic in situ hybridization showed that Ning7840 carries the short arm of 1R chromosome from rye (Secale cereale L.), on which the race-specific gene Lr26 resides. The RILs were infected with the isolate PRTUS 55, an isolate virulent to Lr26, at anthesis in two greenhouse experiments. The result showed that the lines with LM phenotype had a significantly higher rust resistance than the non-LM lines. Composite interval mapping consistently detected a QTL, Qlr.pser.1BL, for APR on chromosome 1BL. Qlr.pser.1BL peaked at lm and explained up to 60.8% of phenotypic variation for leaf rust resistance in two greenhouse experiments, therefore, lm from Ning7840 may have pleiotropic effects on APR to leaf rust."

"19320833","abstracttext","Trichothecenes are isoprenoid mycotoxins produced in wheat infected with the filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum. Some fungal genes for trichothecene biosynthesis (Tri genes) are known to be under control of transcription factors encoded by Tri6 and Tri10. Tri6 and Tri10 deletion mutants were constructed in order to discover additional genes regulated by these factors in planta. Both mutants were greatly reduced in pathogenicity and toxin production and these phenotypes were largely restored by genetic complementation with the wild-type gene. Transcript levels for over 200 genes were altered > or = twofold for Deltatri6 or Deltatri10 mutants including nearly all known Tri genes. Also reduced were transcript levels for enzymes in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway leading to farnesyl pyrophosphate, the immediate molecular precursor of trichothecenes. DNA sequences 5' to isoprenoid biosynthetic genes were enriched for the Tri6p DNA binding motif, YNAGGCC, in F. graminearum but not in related species that do not produce trichothecenes. To determine the effect of trichothecene metabolites on gene expression, cultures were treated with trichodiene, the first metabolic intermediate specific to the trichothecene biosynthetic pathway. A total of 153 genes were upregulated by added trichodiene and were significantly enriched for genes likely involved in cellular transport. Differentially regulated genes will be targeted for functional analysis to discover additional factors involved in toxin biosynthesis, toxin resistance and pathogenesis."
"19497949","articletitle","Low pH regulates the production of deoxynivalenol by Fusarium graminearum."
"19497949","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum, which causes the globally important head blight disease of wheat, is responsible for the production of the harmful mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in infected grain. The production of DON by F. graminearum occurs at much higher levels during infection than during axenic growth, and it is therefore important to understand how DON production is regulated in the fungus. Recently, we have identified amines as potent inducers of in vitro DON production in F. graminearum. Although amines strongly induced expression of the key DON biosynthesis gene TRI5 and DON production to levels equivalent to those observed during infection, the timing of this induction suggested that other factors are also likely to be important for the regulation of DON biosynthesis. Here we demonstrate that low extracellular pH both promotes and is required for DON production in F. graminearum. A combination of low pH and amines results in significantly enhanced expression of the TRI5 gene and increased DON production during axenic growth. A better understanding of DON production in F. graminearum would have implications in developing future toxin management strategies."

The small brown planthopper (Laodephax striatellus Fallén), one of the most destructive agricultural pests, causes great damage to crops including rice, wheat, and maize. However, information about the genome of L. striatellus is limited. In this study, a small RNA library was constructed from a mixed L. striatellus population and sequenced by Solexa sequencing technology. A total of 501 mature miRNAs were identified, including 227 conserved and 274 novel miRNAs belonging to 125 and 250 families, respectively. Sixty-nine conserved miRNAs that are included in 38 families are predicted to have an RNA secondary structure typically found in miRNAs. Many miRNAs were validated by stem-loop RT-PCR. Comparison with the miRNAs in 84 animal species from miRBase showed that the conserved miRNA families we identified are highly conserved in the Arthropoda phylum. Furthermore, miRanda predicted 2701 target genes for 378 miRNAs, which could be categorized into 52 functional groups annotated by gene ontology. The function of miRNA target genes was found to be very similar between conserved and novel miRNAs. This study of miRNAs in L. striatellus will provide new information and enhance the understanding of the role of miRNAs in the regulation of L. striatellus metabolism and development."

By combining GFF lines with Tg lines carrying a reporter gene located downstream of Gal4 binding sequences (upstream activating sequence: UAS), we investigated the anatomy and developmental processes of the cerebellar neural circuitry. Combining an IO-specific Gal4 line with a UAS reporter line expressing the photoconvertible fluorescent protein Kaede demonstrated the contralateral projections of climbing fibers. Combining a granule cell-specific Gal4 line with a UAS reporter line expressing wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) confirmed direct and/or indirect connections of granule cells with Purkinje cells, eurydendroid cells, and IO neurons in zebrafish. Time-lapse analysis of a granule cell-specific Gal4 line revealed initial random movements and ventral migration of granule cell nuclei. Transgenesis of a reporter gene with another transposon Tol1 system visualized neuronal structure at a single cell resolution. Our findings indicate the usefulness of these zebrafish Gal4 Tg lines for studying the development and function of cerebellar neural circuits."

To investigate how gene expression influences fungal development and pathogenicity in Fusarium graminearum, a causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat and barley, our previous study identified a SR protein FgSrp1 in F. graminearum, and showed that it is important for conidiation, plant infection and pre-mRNA processing. In this study, we identified another SR protein FgSrp2 in F. graminearum, which is orthologous to Schizosaccharomyces pombe Srp2. Our data showed that, whereas yeast Srp2 is essential for growth, deletion of FgSRP2 resulted in only slight defects in vegetative growth and perithecia melanization. FgSrp2 localized to the nucleus and both its N- and C-terminal regions were important for the localization to the nucleus. FgSrp2 interacted with FgSrp1 to form a complex in vivo. Double deletion of FgSRP1 and FgSRP2 revealed that they had overlapping functions in vegetative growth and sexual reproduction. RNA-seq analysis revealed that, although deletion of FgSRP2 alone had minimal effects, deletion of both FgSRP1 and FgSRP2 caused significant changes in gene transcription and RNA splicing. Overall, our results indicated that FgSrp2 regulates vegetative growth, sexual reproduction and pre-mRNA processing by interacting with FgSrp1."

"31990139","abstracttext","Xylitol is a five-carbon sugar alcohol that has a variety of uses in the food and pharmaceutical industries. In xylose assimilating yeasts, NAD(P)H-dependent xylose reductase (XR) catalyzes the reduction of xylose to xylitol. In the present study, XR with varying cofactor specificities was overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to screen for efficient xylitol production. Xylose consumption and xylitol yields were higher when NADPH-dependent enzymes (Candida tropicalis XR and S. cerevisiae Gre3p aldose reductase) were expressed, indicating that heterologous enzymes can utilize the intracellular NADPH pool more efficiently than the NADH pool, where they may face competition from native enzymes. This was confirmed by overexpression of a NADH-preferring C. tropicalis XR mutant, which led to decreased xylose consumption and lower xylitol yield. To increase intracellular NADPH availability for xylitol production, the promoter of the ZWF1 gene, coding for the first enzyme of the NADPH-generating pentose phosphate pathway, was replaced with the constitutive GPD promoter in a strain expressing C. tropicalis XR. This change led to a ~12% increase in xylitol yield. Deletion of XYL2 and SOR1, whose gene products can use xylitol as substrate, did not further increase xylitol yield. Using wheat stalk hydrolysate as source of xylose, the constructed strain efficiently produced xylitol, demonstrating practical relevance of this approach."

"32791445","abstracttext","Intracellular Ca 2+ plays an essential role in plant cellular sensing of various environmental stress signals by modulating the activity of Ca 2+ -binding proteins. Leymus chinensis is a dominant forage grass widely distributed in the Eurasian Steppe that is well adapted to drought and salty soils common in the region. Through transcript profiling of L. chinensis roots, we identified a transcript predicted to encode histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRC), a protein recently characterized in wheat. L. chinensis HRC (LcH RC) localized in the nucleus, as demonstrated using a transient gene expression method that we developed for this species. Different regions of LcHRC showed affinity for either Ca 2+ or Zn 2+ , but not Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ . Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings heterologously overexpressing LcHRC showed greater sensitivity to abscisic acid (ABA), along with decreased expression of some ABA-induced marker genes, but no increase in ABA content. Screening a Arabidopsis cDNA yeast library identified a Tudor/PWWP/MBT-domain-containing protein (AtPWWP3) that interacts with LcHRC. AtPWWP3 also localized in the nucleus and is predicted to mediate gene expression by modifying histone deacetylation. Based on these results, we propose a functional model of LcHRC action."

"33072145","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust caused by the fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ( Pgt ), is regaining prominence due to the recent emergence of virulent isolates and epidemics in Africa, Europe and Central Asia. The development and deployment of wheat cultivars with multiple stem rust resistance ( Sr ) genes stacked together will provide durable resistance. However, certain disease resistance genes can suppress each other or fail in particular genetic backgrounds. Therefore, the function of each Sr gene must be confirmed after incorporation into an Sr -gene stack. This is difficult when using pathogen disease assays due to epistasis from recognition of multiple avirulence (Avr) effectors. Heterologous delivery of single Avr effectors can circumvent this limitation, but this strategy is currently limited by the paucity of cloned Pgt Avrs . To accelerate Avr gene cloning, we outline a procedure to develop a mutant population of Pgt spores and select for gain-of-virulence mutants. We used ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS) to mutagenize urediniospores and create a library of > 10,000 independent mutant isolates that were combined into 16 bulks of ~658 pustules each. We sequenced random mutants and determined the average mutation density to be 1 single nucleotide variant (SNV) per 258 kb. From this, we calculated that a minimum of three independently derived gain-of-virulence mutants is required to identify a given Avr gene. We inoculated the mutant library onto plants containing Sr43 , Sr44 , or Sr45 and obtained 9, 4, and 14 mutants with virulence toward Sr43 , Sr44 , or Sr45 , respectively. However, only mutants identified on Sr43 and Sr45 maintained their virulence when reinolculated onto the lines from which they were identified. We further characterized 8 mutants with virulence toward Sr43 . These also maintained their virulence profile on the stem rust international differential set containing 20 Sr genes, indicating that they were most likely not accidental contaminants. In conclusion, our method allows selecting for virulent mutants toward targeted resistance ( R ) genes. The development of a mutant library from as little as 320 mg spores creates a resource that enables screening against several R genes without the need for multiple rounds of spore multiplication and mutagenesis."

Twenty Angus x Angus-Hereford steer calves (initial BW = 231 +/- 25 kg) were allotted randomly to one of two winter grazing treatments: 1) grazing winter wheat pasture to achieve a high rate of BW gain (HGW); or 2) grazing dormant tallgrass native range (NR). Steers in the NR treatment were provided 0.91 kg.steer(-1).d(-1) of a 41% CP (as-fed basis) cottonseed meal supplement. Following the grazing period, steers were assigned randomly to feedlot pens. Steers were fed to a common endpoint of 1.27 cm of backfat between the 12th and 13th rib. Four steers from each treatment were slaughtered at the end of the grazing period, and the remaining steers from each treatment (n = 6) were slaughtered at the predetermined compositional endpoint. Intramuscular and s.c. fat samples were collected from LM sections of each steer at the 12th-/13th-rib interface on the left side. Pools of RNA were prepared for HGW and NR s.c. adipose tissue from steers slaughtered immediately after grazing. Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed followed by dot-blot hybridization screening to confirm differential expression of subtracted transcripts. Transcripts confirmed to be differentially expressed were subjected to dideoxy chain-termination sequencing. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR was performed on three differentially expressed clones: osteonectin, ferritin heavy chain, and decorin. Osteonectin, ferritin heavy chain, and decorin gene expression was greater (P < 0.05) in s.c. than in i.m. adipose tissue of finished steers. A depot x background interaction for osteonectin (P < 0.01) and ferritin heavy chain (P = 0.03) gene expression was observed for steers slaughtered after grazing, indicating that nutritional management can affect gene expression in adipose tissue depots differently. No differences resulting from prefinishing nutritional background (HGW or NR) were noted in osteonectin, ferritin heavy chain, or decorin gene expression in i.m. adipose tissue collected from finished steers, which might have resulted from feeding steers to the same compositional endpoint. Our data suggest that nutritional background alters gene expression in adipose depots, and that depots are influenced differently."

"22807623","abstracttext","The transcription factor family intimately regulates gene expression in response to hormones, biotic and abiotic factors, symbiotic interactions, cell differentiation, and stress signalling pathways in plants. In this study, 170 AP2/ERF family genes are identified by phylogenetic analysis of the rice genome (Oryza sativa l. japonica) and they are divided into a total of 11 groups, including four major groups (AP2, ERF, DREB, and RAV), 10 subgroups, and two soloists. Gene structure analysis revealed that, at position-6, the amino acid threonine (Thr-6) is conserved in the double domain AP2 proteins compared to the amino acid arginine (Arg-6), which is preserved in the single domain of ERF proteins. In addition, the histidine (His) amino acid is found in both domains of the double domain AP2 protein, which is missing in single domain ERF proteins. Motif analysis indicates that most of the conserved motifs, apart from the AP2/ERF domain, are exclusively distributed among the specific clades in the phylogenetic tree and regulate plausible functions. Expression analysis reveals a widespread distribution of the rice AP2/ERF family genes within plant tissues. In the vegetative organs, the transcripts of these genes are found most abundant in the roots followed by the leaf and stem; whereas, in reproductive tissues, the gene expression of this family is observed high in the embryo and lemma. From chromosomal localization, it appears that repetition and tandem-duplication may contribute to the evolution of new genes in the rice genome. In this study, interspecies comparisons between rice and wheat reveal 34 rice loci and unveil the extent of collinearity between the two genomes. It was subsequently ascertained that chromosome-9 has more orthologous loci for CRT/DRE genes whereas chromosome-2 exhibits orthologs for ERF subfamily members. Maximum conserved synteny is found in chromosome-3 for AP2 double domain subfamily genes. Macrosynteny between rice and Arabidopsis, a distant, related genome, uncovered 11 homologs/orthologs loci in both genomes. The distribution of AP2/ERF family gene paralogs in Arabidopsis was most frequent in chromosome-1 followed by chromosome-5. In Arabidopsis, ERF subfamily gene orthologs are found on chromosome-1, chromosome-3, and chromosome-5, whereas DRE subfamily genes are found on chromosome-2 and chromosome-5. Orthologs for RAV and AP2 with double domains in Arabidopsis are located on chromosome-1 and chromosome-3, respectively. In conclusion, the data generated in this survey will be useful for conducting genomic research to determine the precise role of the AP2/ERF gene during stress responses with the ultimate goal of improving crops."
"1932695","articletitle","Amber codon suppression: the in vivo and in vitro analysis of two C-hordein genes from barley."
"1932695","abstracttext","A 1420 bp genomic fragment (lambda-hor1-17) encompassing a Hor-1 gene encoding a C-hordein polypeptide is presented. The deduced amino acid sequence is 261 residues long. It comprises a 20 amino acid signal peptide, unique NH2- and COOH-terminal regions and a coding region comprised of pentapeptide (PQQPY) and octapeptide (PQQPFPQQ) repeat motifs. The 431 bp of 5' non-coding region contains a 'TATA box' at -105, a 'CACA box' (-181 to -201) and a -300 prolamin element. In the 3' non-coding region there are two putative polyadenylation signals located 88 and 142 bp downstream of the stop codon. The structure of lambda-hor1-17 is compared with that of another gene (lambda-hor1-14) encoding a C-hordein polypeptide, which contains an amber codon interrupting the ORF. A functional assay in which the 5' non-coding regions of the two genes were fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene demonstrated that both genes were transcriptionally active and that circa 430 bp of the C-hordein promoters were sufficient to drive the expression of the GUS gene in developing barley endosperms. It also demonstrated that both promoters had transcriptional efficiencies comparable with that of the 35S CaMV promoter. The in vitro translation of the coding region of lambda-hor1-14 in the wheat germ system showed that the premature stop codon could be partially suppressed. The suppression was also demonstrated in a transient expression assay in vivo using isolated barley endosperms."

"8443339","abstracttext","A reproducible and efficient transformation system has been developed for maize that is based on direct DNA uptake into embryogenic protoplasts and regeneration of fertile plants from protoplast-derived transgenic callus tissues. Plasmid DNA, containing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene, under the control of the doubled enhancer element (the -208 to -46 bp upstream fragment) from CaMV 35S promoter, linked to the truncated (up to -389 bp from ATG) promoter of wheat, alpha-amylase gene was introduced into protoplasts from suspension culture of HE/89 genotype. The constructed transformation vectors carried either the neomycin phosphotransferase (NPTII) or phosphinothricin acetyltransferase (PAT) gene as selective marker. The applied DNA uptake protocol has resulted at least in 10-20 resistant calli, or GUS-expressing colonies after treatment of 10(6) protoplasts. Vital GUS staining of microcalli has made possible the shoot regeneration from the GUS-stained tissues. 80-90% of kanamycin or PPT resistant calli showed GUS activity, and transgenic plants were regenerated from more than 140 clones. Both Southern hybridization and PCR analysis showed the presence of introduced foreign genes in the genomic DNA of the transformants. The chimeric promoter, composed of a tissue specific monocot promoter, and the viral enhancer element specified similar expression pattern in maize plants, as it was determined by the full CaMV 35S promoter in dicot and other monocot plants. The highest GUS specific activity was found in older leaves with progressively less activity in young leaves, stem and root. Histochemical localization of GUS revealed promoter function in leaf epidermis, mesophyll and vascular bundles, in the cortex and vascular cylinder of the root. In roots, the meristematic tip region and vascular tissues stained intensively. Selected transformants were grown up to maturity, and second-generation seedlings with segregation for GUS activity were obtained after outcrossing. The GUS-expressing segregants carried also the NPTII gene as shown by Southern hybridization."
"8616217","articletitle","The macrophage-specific membrane protein Nramp controlling natural resistance to infections in mice has homologues expressed in the root system of plants."
"8616217","abstracttext","In mice, natural resistance or susceptibility to infection with Mycobacteria, Salmonella, and Leishmania is controlled by a gene named Bcg. Bcg regulates the capacity of macrophages to limit intracellular replication of the ingested parasites, and is believed to regulate a key bactericidal mechanism of this cell. Recently, we have cloned the Bcg gene and shown that it encodes a novel macrophage-specific membrane protein designated Nramp. A routine search of the public databases for sequences homologous to Nramp identified 3 expressed sequence tags (EST) that show strong similarities to the mammalian protein. We report the identification and cloning of a full-length cDNA clone corresponding to a plant homologue (OsNramp1) of mammalian Nramp. Predicted amino acid sequence of the plant protein indicates a remarkable degree of similarity (60% homology) with its mammalian counterpart, including identical number, position, and composition of transmembrane domains, glycosylation signals, and consensus transport motif, suggesting an identical overall secondary structure and membrane organization for the two proteins. This high degree of structural similarity indicates that the two proteins may be functionally related, possibly through a common mechanism of transport. RNA hybridization studies and RT-PCR analyses indicate that OsNramp1 mRNA is expressed primarily in roots and only at very low levels in leaves/stem. DNA hybridization studies indicate that OsNramp1 is not a single gene, but rather forms part of a novel gene family which has several members in all plants tested including cereals such as rice, wheat, and corn, and also in common weed species. The striking degree of conservation between the macrophage-specific mammalian Nramp and its OsNramp1 plant homologue is discussed with respect to possible implications in the metabolism of nitrate in both organisms."
"10397340","articletitle","New experimental and computational approaches to the analysis of gene expression."
"10397340","abstracttext","Public and private EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) programs provide access to a large number of ESTs from a number of plant species, including Arabidopsis, corn, soybean, rice, wheat. In addition to the homology of each EST to genes in GenBank, information about homology to all other ESTs in the data base can be obtained. To estimate expression levels of genes represented in the DuPont EST data base we count the number of times each gene has been seen in different cDNA libraries, from different tissues, developmental stages or induction conditions. This quantitation of message levels is quite accurate for highly expressed messages and, unlike conventional Northern blots, allows comparison of expression levels between different genes. Lists of most highly expresses genes in different libraries can be compiled. Also, if EST data is available for cDNA libraries derived from different developmental stages, gene expression profiles across development can be assembled. We present an example of such a profile for soybean seed development. Gene expression data obtained from Electronic Northern analysis can be confirmed and extended beyond the realm of highly expressed genes by using high density DNA arrays. The ESTs identified as interesting can be arrayed on nylon or glass and probed with total labeled cDNA first strand from the tissue of interest. Two-color fluorescent labeling allows accurate mRNA ratio measurements. We are currently using the DNA array technology to study chemical induction of gene expression and the biosynthesis of oil, carbohydrate and protein in developing seeds."

"9675892","abstracttext","Colonization-defective, transposon-induced mutants of the efficient root colonizer Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS365 were identified with a gnotobiotic system. Most mutants were impaired in known colonization traits, i.e., prototrophy for amino acids, motility, and synthesis of the O-antigen of LPS (lipopolysaccharide). Mutants lacking the O-antigen of LPS were impaired in both colonization and competitive growth whereas one mutant (PCL1205) with a shorter O-antigen chain was defective only in colonization ability, suggesting a role for the intact O-antigen of LPS in colonization. Eight competitive colonization mutants that were not defective in the above-mentioned traits colonized the tomato root tip well when inoculated alone, but were defective in competitive root colonization of tomato, radish, and wheat, indicating they contained mutations affecting host range. One of these eight mutants (PCL1201) was further characterized and contains a mutation in a gene that shows homology to the Escherichia coli nuo4 gene, which encodes a subunit of one of two known NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductases. Competition experiments in an oxygen-poor medium between mutant PCL1201 and its parental strain showed a decreased growth rate of mutant PCL1201. The requirement of the nuo4 gene homolog for optimal growth under conditions of oxygen limitation suggests that the root-tip environment is micro-aerobic. A mutant characterized by a slow growth rate (PCL1216) was analyzed further and contained a mutation in a gene with similarity to the E. coli HtrB protein, a lauroyl transferase that functions in lipid A biosynthesis."
"15543947","articletitle","The p50-p50 NF-kappaB complex as a stimulus-specific repressor of gene activation."
"15543947","abstracttext","The transcription factor NF-kappaB can be activated in different forms, including transcriptional activating and repressing forms. Intestinal epithelial cells have been found to modulate the relative levels of the p65-p50 and p50-p50 NF-kappaB complexes in a number of instances, and here we show that this ratio was altered in response to dietary fiber (wheat bran) and carcinogen exposure (azoxymethane). The influence of these complexes on gene regulation was examined in more detail in cell culture models. The colon-derived HT-29 cell line likewise activated both p65-p50 and p50-p50 NF-kappaB complexes: TNF-alpha triggered a strong, sustained p65-p50 activation with lower relative levels of p50-p50, whereas IL-1beta transiently activated p65-p50 with higher relative levels of p50-p50. Transfection experiments with an NF-kappaB reporter plasmid indicated that p50 was a repressor in HT-29 cells. Increased expression of the p50-p50 dimer by an adenovirus showed that the p50-p50 dimer suppressed IL-1beta activation of endogenous genes more than 5-fold (TNF-alpha, Cox-2 and IL-8), whereas gene activation by TNF-alpha was not significantly affected. DNA binding analyses showed a number of strong p50-p50 binding sites on these promoters. The selective p50-p50 suppression of IL-1beta gene activation corresponded to the transient nature of p65-p50 activation induced by IL-1beta (in both HT-29 and Caco-2 cells). Our findings demonstrate a novel gene regulatory mechanism for the NF-kappaB p50-p50 complex: a signal-specific transcriptional repression that appears to selectively inhibit stimuli that transiently activate p65-p50 complexes."

"12923307","abstracttext","Sequence tagged site (STS) markers for eight resistance genes against Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici were used to screen a set of near-isogenic lines of wheat cv. Thatcher containing in total 40 different Lr genes and their alleles. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was carried out by using STS, SCAR and CAPS primers specific for the leaf rust resistance genes Lr1, Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24, Lr28, Lr37 and Lr47. The STS, CAPS and SCAR markers linked to resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, Lr19, Lr24, Lr37 and Lr47 were found to be reliable in diverse genetic backgrounds. The amplification product of the Lr1 gene marker was detected in the susceptible cv. Thatcher and in all of the near-isogenic lines examined except Lr2a, Lr2b, Lr2c and Lr19. The sequence analysis of PCR products amplified in lines Lr1, Lr10, Lr28 and in cv. Thatcher indicated that the near-isogenic lines and cv. Thatcher contained in the targeted chromosome region an allele that differed from the original alleles corresponding to Lr1/6*Thatcher (TLR621) and susceptible Thatcher (TH621). The amplification product specific to the STS marker of the Lr1 gene was amplified in almost all Thatcher near-isogenic lines and in cv. Thatcher because their alleles possessed primer sequences identical to the original allele TLR621. The marker for the Lr28 resistance gene was identified in line Lr28, carrying gene Lr28, and in 21 other near-isogenic lines. The sequencing of PCR products specific to Lr28 and generated in lines Lr1, Lr10 and Lr28 indicated that the lines Lr1, Lr10 and Lr28 are heterozygous in this region."

"12788701","abstracttext","Mycotoxin contamination associated with head blight of wheat and other grains caused by Fusarium culmorum and F. graminearum is a chronic threat to crop, human, and animal health throughout the world. One of the most important toxins in terms of human exposure is deoxynivalenol (DON) (formerly called vomitoxin), an inhibitor of protein synthesis with a broad spectrum of toxigenicity against animals. Certain Fusarium toxins have additional antimicrobial activity, and the phytotoxin fusaric acid has recently been shown to modulate fungus-bacterium interactions that affect plant health (Duffy and Défago, Phytopathology 87:1250-1257, 1997). The potential impact of DON on Fusarium competition with other microorganisms has not been described previously. Any competitive advantage conferred by DON would complicate efforts to control Fusarium during its saprophytic growth on crop residues that are left after harvest and constitute the primary inoculum reservoir for outbreaks in subsequent plantings. We examined the effect of the DON mycotoxin on ecological interactions between pathogenic Fusarium and Trichoderma atroviride strain P1, a competitor fungus with biocontrol activity against a wide range of plant diseases. Expression of the Trichoderma chitinase genes, ech42 and nag1, which contribute to biocontrol activity, was monitored in vitro and on crop residues of two maize cultivars by using goxA reporter gene fusions. We found that DON-producing F. culmorum and F. graminearum strains repressed expression of nag1-gox. DON-negative wild-type Fusarium strains and a DON-negative mutant with an insertional disruption in the tricothecene biosynthetic gene, tri5, had no effect on antagonist gene expression. The role of DON as the principal repressor above other pathogen factors was confirmed. Exposure of Trichoderma to synthetic DON or to a non-DON-producing Fusarium mutant resulted in the same level of nag1-gox repression as the level observed with DON-producing FUSARIUM: DON repression was specific for nag1-gox and had no effect, either positive or negative, on expression of another key chitinase gene, ech42. This is the first demonstration that a target pathogen down-regulates genes in a fungal biocontrol agent, and our results provide evidence that mycotoxins have a novel ecological function as factors in Fusarium competitiveness."

"14636998","abstracttext","Here we report the first genomic library of wild rice constructed on a plant-transformation-competent binary vector (BIBAC2) and transformation of the large insert DNA into rice via Agrobacterium. We selected Oryza officinalis for genomic library construction. The library consists of 55,296 clones and stored in one hundred forty-four 384-well plates. Random sampling of 140 clones indicated an average insert size of 71 Kb at a range of 15-235 Kb and 4.8% empty vectors. Four wheat chloroplast probes and four maize mitochondrial probes were hybridized separately to the library, showing that contamination with organellar DNAs is very low (0.61% and 0.04%, respectively). The binary bacterial artificial chromosome (BIBAC) library provides 5.3 haploid genome equivalents, implying a 99.5% probability of recovering any specific sequence of interest. A stability test indicated that the large DNA inserts were stable in this BIBAC vector both in host cells of Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium. Two restriction-fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers R288 and C820, which co-segregate with brown planthopper (BPH) resistance gene Qbp2, were used to screen the library, and identified seven and eight positive clones, respectively. The candidate clones of target gene isolated from the library are directly used to transform cultivated rice. After screening the Agrobacterium strains and helper plasmids, and using an improved procedure of transformation, a BIBAC clone with 120 Kb O. officinalis DNA insert was successfully transferred into the rice genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The system developed here should serve as source for gene discovery, gene cloning and genome-related research in wild rice."

"16435125","abstracttext","An uncharacterized source of seedling resistance to Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici was identified in an advanced wheat breeding line WAWHT2046. Genetic analysis based on a WAWHT2046/Carnamah-derived double haploid (DH) population demonstrated monogenic inheritance of seedling stripe rust resistance in WAWHT2046. The gene controlling stripe rust resistance in line WAWHT2046 was tentatively designated YrWA. The chromosome 5AL located awn inhibitor gene B1, possessed by WAWHT2046, also showed monogenic inheritance when the DH population was scored for the presence and absence of awns. Joint segregation analysis at the B1 and YrWA loci indicated genetic linkage between the two loci. A recombination value of 12.2 cM was computed using Mapmanager. This association located YrWA in the chromosome arm 5AL. Molecular mapping using microsatellite markers placed YrWA distal to B1. All molecular markers mapped proximal to the awn inhibitor locus B1. As no other stripe rust resistance gene is reported to be located in the chromosome arm 5AL, YrWA was permanently designated as Yr34. Yr34 produced an intermediate (23C) seedling infection type and expressed very low stripe rust response (10R-MR) on adult plants in the field, similar to the resistance gene Yr17. In addition to Yr34, this mapping population segregated for three genetically independent adult plant stripe rust resistance genes. The detection of DH lines with completely susceptible response, higher than that shown by the Yr34-lacking parent Carnamah, suggested that both parents contributed adult plant resistance. The use of WAWHT2046 as a parent in breeding programs would also contribute APR in addition to Yr34."

"16377218","abstracttext","Head blight or scab disease caused by Fusarium graminearum poses a major threat to wheat and barley production in North America and other countries. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of F. graminearum pathogenesis, we have generated a collection of random insertional mutants. In mutant 222, one of the transformants significantly reduced in virulence, the transforming vector was inserted at amino acid 269 of the hydroxymethyl-glutaryl CoA reductase gene (HMR1) that encodes a key enzyme in sterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis. The N-terminal transmembrane domains of HMR1 were disrupted, but the C-terminal catalytic domain was intact in mutant 222. We failed to isolate mutants deleted of the HMR1 gene, suggesting that HMR1 is an essential gene. Mutants deleted of the N-terminal 254 amino acids of HMR1 were viable and phenotypically similar to mutant 222. In both mutant 222 and the hmr1Delta254 mutants, a 3-kb truncated HMR1 transcript was detectable by northern blot analyses. In the wild-type strain, only the 5-kb messenger was observed. The initiation site of truncated HMR1 transcripts was determined by 5'-RACE to be 507bp upstream from the catalytic subunit. When a HMR1 fragment corresponding to the DNA sequence of HMR1269-641 was translationally fused to a promoter-less GFP construct, green fluorescent signals were detectable in vegetative hyphae of the resulting transformants. These data indicate that this region of HMR1 ORF has cryptic promoter activity and can express the catalytic domain in hmr1 mutants deleted of its N-terminal portion. Our results also illustrate the importance of the HMR1 gene and the function of its transmembrane domains in F. graminearum."

"16832693","abstracttext","In order to assess global changes in gene expression patterns in stress-induced tissues, we conducted large-scale analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in common wheat. Twenty-one cDNA libraries derived from stress-induced tissues, such as callus, as well as liquid cultures and abiotic stress conditions (temperature treatment, desiccation, photoperiod, moisture and ABA) were constructed. Several thousand colonies were randomly selected from each of these 21 cDNA libraries and sequenced from both the 5' and 3' ends. By computing abundantly expressed ESTs, correlated expression patterns of genes across the tissues were monitored. Furthermore, the relationships between gene expression profiles among the stress-induced tissues were inferred from the gene expression patterns. Multi-dimensional analysis of EST data is analogous to microarray experiments. As an example, genes specifically induced and/or suppressed by cold acclimation and heat-shock treatments were selected in silico. Four hundred and ninety genes showing fivefold induction or 218 genes for suppression in comparison to the control expression level were selected. These selected genes were annotated with the BLAST search. Furthermore, gene ontology was conducted for these genes with the InterPro search. Because genes regulated in response to temperature treatment were successfully selected, this method can be applied to other stress-treated tissues. Then, the method was applied to screen genes in response to abiotic stresses such as drought and ABA treatments. In silico selection of screened genes from virtual display should provide a powerful tool for functional plant genomics."

"19090153","abstracttext","The aim of the present study was to detect Streptomyces griseus from Isfahan soil using biochemical, morphological and molecular techniques. Soil samples were collected from different regions (compost, 50 year old garden, river bed, clove, wheat farms and domestic yards) of Isfahan in two different seasons. One gram of each sample was serially diluted and cultivated in a primary isolation medium. Morphological shapes of colonies and vegetative hyphae were initially used to separate the grown bacteria of the samples. Various biochemical tests based on Bergey's manual of systemic bacteriology were performed to separate the Streptomyces from other related Genera. In order to further separate Streptomyces grisesus, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) was used to detect the presence of aphE and strA genes in isolated colonies. Biochemical and morphological results, showed the presence of several species of Streptomyces in the collected samples. The expected band of 924 bp belonging to strA gene was observed in the positive control bacterial DNA (PTCC 1125). Several other bands were also observed in the positive control sample. From the total of 10 colonies that undergone molecular detection for the presents of strA gene, 6 colonies (W1, W3, W5, F4, F5, F26) showed only one band at 750 bp and four (W1, W3, F5, F26) showed an extra band of approximately 924 bp band as well. The expected band of 671 bp belonging to aphE gene was detected in positive control bacterial DNA (PTCC 1125). None of the soil samples, however, showed the presence of the aphE gene (data not shown)."

"18700829","abstracttext","The foliar disease septoria tritici blotch, caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola, is currently the most important wheat disease in Europe. Gene expression was examined under highly different conditions, using 10 expressed sequence tag libraries generated from M. graminicola isolate IPO323 using seven in vitro and three in planta growth conditions. To identify fungal clones in the interaction libraries, we developed a selection method based on hybridization with the entire genomic DNA of M. graminicola, to selectively enrich these libraries for fungal genes. Assembly of the 27,007 expressed sequence tags resulted in 9,190 unigenes, representing 5.2 Mb of the estimated 39-Mb genome size of M. graminicola. All libraries contributed significantly to the number of unigenes, especially the in planta libraries representing different stages of pathogenesis, which covered 15% of the library-specific unigenes. Even under presymptomatic conditions (5 days postinoculation), when fungal biomass is less than 5%, this method enabled us to efficiently capture fungal genes expressed during pathogenesis. Many of these genes were uniquely expressed in planta, indicating that in planta gene expression significantly differed from in vitro expression. Examples of gene discovery included a number of cell wall-degrading enzymes, a broad set of genes involved in signal transduction (n=11) and a range of ATP-binding cassette (n=20) and major facilitator superfamily transporter genes (n=12) potentially involved in protection against antifungal compounds or the secretion of pathogenicity factors. In addition, evidence is provided for a mycovirus in M. graminicola that is highly expressed under various stress conditions, in particular, under nitrogen starvation. Our analyses provide a unique window on in vitro and in planta gene expression of M. graminicola."

"17584952","abstracttext","Despite being the number one fruit crop in the world, very little is known about the phylogeny and molecular biology of banana (Musa spp.). Six banana rbcS gene families encoding the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from six different Musa spp. are presented. For a comprehensive phylogenetic study using Musa rbcS genes, a total of 57 distinct rbcS sequences was isolated from six accessions that contained different combinations of the A and B ancestral/parental genomes. As a result, five of the six members of the rbcS gene family could be affiliated with the A and/or B Musa genomes and at least three of the six gene families most likely existed before Musa A and B genomes separated. By combining sequence data with quantitative real-time PCR it was determined that the different Musa rbcS gene family members are also often multiply represented in each genome, with the highest copy numbers in the B genome. Expression of some of the rbcS genes varied in intensity and in different tissues indicating differences in regulation. To analyse and compare regulatory sequences of Musa rbcS genes, promoter and terminator regions were cloned for three Musa rbcS genes. Transient transformation assays using promoter-reporter-terminator constructs in maize, wheat, and sugarcane demonstrated that the rbcS-Ma1, rbcS-Ma3, and rbcS-Ma5 promoters could be useful for transgene expression in heterologous expression systems. Furthermore, the rbcS-Ma1 terminator resulted in a 2-fold increase of transgene expression when directly compared with the widely used Nos terminator."

"22016423","abstracttext","HvCO9 was characterized to elucidate the barley flowering control mechanisms and to investigate the functional diversification of the barley CONSTANS-like (CO-like) genes in flowering. HvCO9 was located on the same chromosome, 1HL, as Ppd-H2 (HvFT3), which is a positive regulator of short-day (SD) flowering. A phylogenetic analysis showed that HvCO9 was located on the same branch of the CO-like gene tree as rice Ghd7 and the barley and wheat VRN2 genes, which are all negative regulators of flowering. High level HvCO9 expressions were observed under SD conditions, whereas its expression levels were quite low under long-day (LD) conditions. HvCO9 expression correlated with HvFT1 and HvFT2 expression under SD conditions, although no clear effect of HvCO9 on HvFT3 expression, or vice versa, under SD conditions was observed. The over-expression of HvCO9 in rice plants produced a remarkable delay in flowering. In transgenic rice, the expression levels of the flowering-related Ehd1 gene, which is a target gene of Ghd7, and its downstream genes were suppressed, causing a delay in flowering. These results suggest that HvCO9 may act as a negative regulator of flowering under non-inductive SD conditions in barley; this activity is similar to that of rice Ghd7 under non-inductive LD conditions, but the functional targets of these genes may be different. Our results indicate that barley has developed its own pathways to control flowering by using homologous genes with modifications for the timing of expression. Further, it is hypothesized that each pathway may target different genes after gene duplication or species diversification."
"22911265","articletitle","Combinational transformation of three wheat genes encoding fructan biosynthesis enzymes confers increased fructan content and tolerance to abiotic stresses in tobacco."
"22911265","abstracttext_key message","Seven kinds of transgenic tobacco plants transformed with combinations of three FBE genes were obtained. The transgenic plants transformed with Ta1-SST + Ta6-SFT genes appeared to have the highest fructan or soluble sugar content and the strongest salt tolerance. Fructan is thought to be one of the important regulators involved in plant tolerance to various abiotic stresses. In this study, wheat-derived genes, Ta1-SST, Ta6-SFT, and Ta1-FFT, encoding fructan biosynthesis enzymes (FBE) were isolated and cloned into vectors modified pBI121 or pZP211. Seven different combinations of the three target genes were transformed into tobacco plants through an Agrobacterium-mediated approach, and transgenic tobacco plants were identified by PCR, ELISA, and Southern blotting. Compared with tobacco plants transformed with other six combinations of the three target genes and with wild-type plants, the transgenic plants transformed with Ta1-SST + Ta6-SFT genes contained the highest fructan and soluble sugar content. All seven types of transgenic tobacco plants displayed a much higher level of tolerance to drought, low temperature, and high salinity compared with the wild type. Differences of drought and low temperature tolerance between the transgenic plants containing a single FBE gene and those harboring two or three FBE genes were not significant, but the salt tolerance level of the transgenic plants with different FBE gene combinations from high to low was: Ta1-SST + Ta6-SFT > Ta1-SST + Ta6-SFT + Ta1-FFT > Ta1-SST + Ta1-FFT > Ta1-SFT + Ta1-FFT > single FBE gene. These results indicated that the tolerances of the transgenic tobacco plants to various abiotic stresses were associated with the transformed target gene combinations and the contents of fructan and soluble sugar contained in the transgenic plants."

"22867849","abstracttext","The combined data set of the acl1 and tef-1α gene sequences of 61 fungal strains assigned to Fusarium tricinctum, Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium acuminatum, Fusarium arthrosporioides, Fusarium flocciferum and Fusarium torulosum were used to study the phylogenetic relations between taxa. F. tricinctum, F. acuminatum and F. avenaceum formed distinct clades. Members of the F. tricinctum/F. acuminatum clade fall into three well supported lineages, of which the largest includes the epitype of F. tricinctum. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) was used to amplify a 167 bp portion of the acl1 gene in F. tricinctum (Corda) Saccardo. DNA amplification was detected in-tube by indirect calcein fluorescence under black light after 60 min of incubation at 65.5 °C. The assay had a detection limit of 0.95 pg of purified genomic DNA of F. tricinctum CBS 410.86 per reaction, corresponding to ca. 18 genomic copies of the acl1 gene. Specificity of the assay was tested using purified DNA from 67 species and subspecies of Fusarium as well as 50 species comprising 22 genera of other filamentous fungi and yeasts. The assay detected 21 of the 23 F. tricinctum strains tested. Cross reactivity was observed with eight out of 13 strains in F. acuminatum but with none of 17 F. avenaceum strains tested. Specificity was further confirmed by conventional PCR with primers designed from the same gene. Detection of F. tricinctum from culture scrapings directly added to the reaction master mix, in DNA extracts from wheat, in single barley grains or in washings of bulk grain samples are proposed as possible applications showing the suitability of the method for food analysis. Finally it was demonstrated that the LAMP reaction can be run using simple lab equipment such as a heating block, water bath, hybridization oven or household equipment, e.g. a microwave oven."

The use of J. curcas (L) kernel meal in fish feed is limited owing to the presence of toxic and antinutritional constituents. In this study, it was detoxified using heat treatment and organic solvent extraction method. The detoxification process was carried out for 60 min to obtain the detoxified meal. Cyprinus carpio L. fingerlings (n = 180; avg. wt. 3.2 ± 0.07 g) were randomly distributed in five treatment groups with four replicates and fed isonitrogenous diets (crude protein 38%) for 8 weeks. The inclusion levels of the detoxified Jatropha kernel meal (DJKM) and soybean meal (SBM) were as follows: control diet was prepared with fish meal (FM) and wheat meal, without any DJKM and SBM; diets S(50) and J(50) : 50% of FM protein replaced by SBM and DJKM respectively; diets S(75) and J(75) : 75% of FM protein replaced by SBM and DJKM respectively. Highest body mass gain and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) gene expression in brain, liver and muscle were observed for the control group, which were statistically similar to those for J(50) group and significantly (p < 0.05) higher than for all other groups, whereas growth hormone gene expression in brain, liver and muscle exhibited opposite trend. Insulin-like growth factor-1 concentration in plasma did not differ significantly among the five groups. Conclusively, growth performance was in parallel with IGF-1 gene expression and exhibited negative trend with GH gene expression."

"22363562","abstracttext","The level and pattern of nucleotide variation in duplicate gene provide important information on the evolutionary history of polyploids and divergent process between homoeologous loci within lineages. Kengyilia is a group of allohexaploid species with the StYP genomic constitutions in the wheat tribe. To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the Pgk1 gene in Kengyilia and its diploid relatives, three copies of Pgk1 homoeologues were isolated from all sampled hexaploid Kengyilia species and analyzed with the Pgk1 sequences from 47 diploid taxa representing 18 basic genomes in Triticeae. Sequence diversity patterns and genealogical analysis suggested that (1) Kengyilia species from the Central Asia and the Qinghai-Tibetan plateau have independent origins with geographically differentiated P genome donors and diverged levels of nucleotide diversity at Pgk1 locus; (2) a relatively long-time sweep event has allowed the Pgk1 gene within Agropyron to adapt to cold climate triggered by the recent uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; (3) sweep event and population expansion might result in the difference in the d(N)/d(S) value of the Pgk1 gene in allopatric Agropyron populations, and this difference may be genetically transmitted to Kengyilia lineages via independent polyploidization events; (4) an 83 bp MITE element insertion has shaped the Pgk1 loci in the P genome lineage with different geographical regions; (5) the St and P genomes in Kengyilia were donated by Pseudoroegneria and Agropyron, respectively, and the Y genome is closely related to the Xp genome of Peridictyon sanctum. The interplay of evolutionary forces involving diverged natural selection, population expansion, and transposable events in geographically differentiated P genome donors could attribute to geographical differentiation of Kengyilia species via independent origins."

"22700513","abstracttext","The use of mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) as alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) has gained in popularity in recent years due to regulatory restrictions of using AGP in food animal production. Benefits of MOS usage include improvement on animal performance, feed efficiency, and gastrointestinal health. The molecular mechanisms of these functions however are not clear. The goal of the current study was to use a transcriptomics approach to investigate the effects of MOS on the intestinal gene expression profile of young broilers and characterize biological gene pathways responsible for the actions of MOS. One hundred and twenty 1-d-old Cobb 500 broiler chicks were randomly divided into 2 groups and were fed either a standard wheat-soybean meal-based (control) diet or the same diet supplemented with 2.2 g/kg of MOS (Bio-Mos, Alltech, Nicholasville, KY) for 3 wk, followed by jejunal gene expression profiling analysis using chicken-specific Affymetrix microarrays. Results indicated that a total of 672 genes were differentially expressed (P < 0.01 and fold change >1.2) in the jejunum by MOS supplementation. Association analysis indicated that differentially expressed genes are involved in diverse biological functions including energy production, cell death, and protein translation. Expression of 77 protein synthesis-related genes was differentially regulated by MOS in the jejunum. Further pathway analysis indicated that 15 genes related to oxidative phosphorylation were upregulated in the jejunum, and expression of genes important in cellular stress response, such as peroxiredoxin 1, superoxide dismutase 1, and thioredoxin, were also increased by MOS. Differential expression of genes associated with cellular immune processes, including lysozyme, lumican, β 2-microglobin, apolipoprotein A-1, and fibronectin 1, were also observed in MOS-fed broilers. In summary, this study systematically identified biological functions and gene pathways that are important in mediating the biological effects of MOS in broilers."
"23201220","articletitle","Gene silencing in root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.) significantly reduces reproduction in a plant host."
"23201220","abstracttext","Root lesion nematodes (RLNs, Pratylenchus species) are a group of economically important migratory endoparasitic plant pathogens that attack host roots of major crops such as wheat and sugarcane, and can reduce crop yields by 7-15%. Pratylenchus thornei and Pratylenchus zeae were treated with double stranded RNA (dsRNA) to study gene silencing, (RNA interference, RNAi), as a potential strategy for their control. Mixed stages of nematodes of both species ingested dsRNA when incubated in a basic soaking solution in the presence of the neurostimulant octopamine. Incubation for up to 16 h in soaking solutions containing 10-50 mM octopamine, 0.1-1.0 mg/mL FITC, and 0.5-6 mM spermidine did not affect vitality. Spermidine phosphate salt hexahydrate rather than spermidine or spermidine trihydrochloride increased uptake of FITC by nematodes, and this resulted in more effective gene silencing. Silencing pat-10 and unc-87 genes of P. thornei and P. zeae resulted in paralysis and uncoordinated movements in both species, although to a higher degree in P. thornei. There was also a greater reduction in transcript of both genes in P. thornei indicating that it may be more susceptible to RNAi. For P. thornei treated with dsRNA of pat-10 and unc-87 there was a significant reduction (77-81%) in nematode reproduction on carrot mini discs over a 5 week period. The results show that RLNs are clearly amenable to gene silencing, and that in planta delivery of dsRNA to target genes in these nematodes should confer host resistance. Moreover, for the two genes, dsRNA derived from either nematode species silenced the corresponding gene in both species. This implies cross-species control of nematodes via RNAi is possible."

"23242656","abstracttext","Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are Ca(2+)-binding proteins known to play crucial roles in Ca(2+) signal transduction pathways which have been identified throughout plant kingdom and in certain types of protists. Genome-wide analysis of CDPKs have been carried out in Arabidopsis, rice and wheat, and quite a few of CDPKs were proved to play crucial roles in plant stress responsive signature pathways. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of Populus CDPK and its closely related gene families was performed, including phylogeny, chromosome locations, gene structures, and expression profiles. Thirty Populus CDPK genes and twenty closely related kinase genes were identified, which were phylogenetically clustered into eight distinct subfamilies and predominately distributed across fifteen linkage groups (LG). Genomic organization analyses indicated that purifying selection has played a pivotal role in the retention and maintenance of Populus CDPK gene family. Furthermore, microarray analysis showed that a number of Populus CDPK and its closely related genes differentially expressed across disparate tissues and under various stresses. The expression profiles of paralogous pairs were also investigated to reveal their evolution fates. In addition, quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed on nine selected CDPK genes to confirm their responses to drought stress treatment. These observations may lay the foundation for future functional analysis of Populus CDPK and its closely related gene families to unravel their biological roles."

"23090695","abstracttext","Here, α-Amy2/54 gene expression was used as a molecular probe to investigate the interrelationship among nitric oxide (NO), cyclic GMP (cGMP), and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in GA-treated wheat aleurone layers. The inducible expressions of α-Amy2/54 and α-amylase activity were respectively amplified by two NO-releasing compounds, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and spermine NONOate, in a GA-dependent fashion. Similar responses were observed when an inducer of HO-1, hemin-or one of its catalytic products, carbon monoxide (CO) in aqueous solution-was respectively added. The SNP-induced responses, mimicked by 8-bromoguanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cGMP), a cGMP derivative, were NO-dependent. This conclusion was supported by the fact that endogenous NO overproduction was rapidly induced by SNP, and thereafter induction of α-Amy2/54 gene expression and increased α-amylase activity were sensitive to the NO scavenger. We further observed that the above induction triggered by SNP and 8-Br-cGMP was partially prevented by zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPPIX), an inhibitor of HO-1. These blocking effects were clearly reversed by CO, confirming that the above response was HO-1-specific. Further analyses showed that both SNP and 8-Br-cGMP rapidly up-regulated HO-1 gene expression and increased HO activity, and SNP responses were sensitive to cPTIO and the guanylate cyclase inhibitor 6-anilino-5,8-quinolinedione (LY83583). Molecular evidence confirmed that GA-induced GAMYB and ABA-triggered PKABA1 transcripts were up-regulated or down-regulated by SNP, 8-Br-cGMP or CO cotreated with GA. Contrasting changes were observed when cPTIO, LY83583, or ZnPPIX was added. Together, our results suggested that HO-1 is involved in NO- and cGMP-induced α-Amy2/54 gene expression in GA-treated aleurone layers."

"23874628","articletitle","Functional roles of FgLaeA in controlling secondary metabolism, sexual development, and virulence in Fusarium graminearum."
"23874628","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight in cereal crops, produces mycotoxins such as trichothecenes and zearalenone in infected plants. Here, we focused on the function of FgLaeA in F. graminearum, a homolog of Aspergillus nidulans LaeA encoding the global regulator for both secondary metabolism and sexual development. Prior to gene analysis, we constructed a novel luciferase reporter system consisting of a transgenic F. graminearum strain expressing a firefly luciferase gene under control of the promoter for either TRI6 or ZEB2 controlling the biosynthesis of these mycotoxins. Targeted deletion of FgLaeA led to a dramatic reduction of luminescence in reporter strains, indicating that FgLaeA controls the expression of these transcription factors in F. graminearum; reduced toxin accumulation was further confirmed by GC-MS analysis. Overexpression of FgLaeA caused the increased production of trichothecenes and additional metabolites. RNA seq-analysis revealed that gene member(s) belonging to ~70% of total tentative gene clusters, which were previously proposed, were differentially expressed in the ΔFgLaeA strain. In addition, ΔFgLaeA strains exhibited an earlier induction of sexual fruiting body (perithecia) formation and drastically reduced disease symptoms in wheat, indicating that FgLaeA seems to negatively control perithecial induction, but positively control virulence toward the host plant. FgLaeA was constitutively expressed under both mycotoxin production and sexual development conditions. Overexpression of a GFP-FgLaeA fusion construct in the ΔFgLaeA strain restored all phenotypic changes to wild-type levels and led to constitutive expression of GFP in both nuclei and cytoplasm at different developmental stages. A split luciferase assay demonstrated that FgLaeA was able to interact with FgVeA, a homolog of A. nidulans veA. Taken together, these results demonstrate that FgLaeA, a member of putative FgVeA complex, controls secondary metabolism, sexual development, and virulence in F. graminearum, although the specific regulation pattern differs from that of LaeA in A. nidulans."

The reaction pattern of Neijiang 977671 differed from those of the lines with known leaf rust resistance genes used in the test, indicating that Neijiang 977671 may carry a new leaf rust resistance gene(s). With the objective of identifying and mapping the new gene for resistance to leaf rust, F1 and F2 plants, and F2:3 families, from Neijiang 977671 × Zhengzhou 5389 (susceptible) were inoculated with Chinese P. triticina pathotype FHNQ in the greenhouse. Results from the F2 and F2:3 populations indicated that a single dominant gene, temporarily designated LrNJ97, conferred resistance. In order to identify other possible genes in Neijiang 977671 other eight P. triticina pathotypes avirulent on Neijiang 977671 were used to inoculate 25 F2:3 families. The results showed that at least three leaf rust resistance genes were deduced in Neijiang 977671. Bulked segregant analysis was performed on equal amounts of genomic DNA from 20 resistant and 20 susceptible F2 plants. SSR markers polymorphic between the resistant and susceptible bulks were used to analyze the F2:3 families. LrNJ97 was linked to five SSR loci on chromosome 2BL. The two closest flanking SSR loci were Xwmc317 and Xbarc159 at genetic distances of 4.2 and 2.2 cM, respectively. At present two designated genes (Lr50 and Lr58) are located on chromosome 2BL. In the seedling tests, the reaction pattern of LrNJ97 was different from that of Lr50. Lr50 and Lr58 were derived from T. armeniacum and Ae. triuncialis, respectively, whereas according to the pedigree of Neijiang 977671 LrNJ97 is from common wheat. Although seeds of lines with Lr58 were not available, it was concluded that LrNJ97 is likely to be a new leaf rust resistance gene."

"23495849","abstracttext","Constitutive over-expression of the TaDREB3 gene in barley improved frost tolerance of transgenic plants at the vegetative stage of plant development, but leads to stunted phenotypes and 3- to 6-week delays in flowering compared to control plants. In this work, two cold-inducible promoters with contrasting properties, the WRKY71 gene promoter from rice and the Cor39 gene promoter from durum wheat, were applied to optimize expression of TaDREB3. The aim of the work was to increase plant frost tolerance and to decrease or prevent negative developmental phenotypes observed during constitutive expression of TaDREB3. The OsWRKY71 and TdCor39 promoters had low-to-moderate basal activity and were activated by cold treatment in leaves, stems and developing spikes of transgenic barley and rice. Expression of the TaDREB3 gene, driven by either of the tested promoters, led to a significant improvement in frost tolerance. The presence of the functional TaDREB3 protein in transgenic plants was confirmed by the detection of strong up-regulation of cold-responsive target genes. The OsWRKY71 promoter-driven TaDREB3 provides stronger activation of the same target genes than the TdCor39 promoter. Analysis of the development of transgenic plants in the absence of stress revealed small or no differences in plant characteristics and grain yield compared with wild-type plants. The WRKY71-TaDREB3 promoter-transgene combination appears to be a promising tool for the enhancement of cold and frost tolerance in crop plants but field evaluation will be needed to confirm that negative development phenotypes have been controlled."

"23918958","abstracttext","The phytase activity in food and feedstuffs is an important nutritional parameter. Members of the Triticeae tribe accumulate purple acid phosphatase phytases (PAPhy) during grain filling. This accumulation elevates mature grain phytase activities (MGPA) up to levels between ~650 FTU/kg for barley and 6000 FTU/kg for rye. This is notably more than other cereals. For instance, rice, maize, and oat have MGPAs below 100 FTU/kg. The cloning and characterization of the PAPhy gene complement from wheat, barley, rye, einkorn, and Aegilops tauschii is reported here. The Triticeae PAPhy genes generally consist of a set of paralogues, PAPhy_a and PAPhy_b, and have been mapped to Triticeae chromosomes 5 and 3, respectively. The promoters share a conserved core but the PAPhy_a promoter have acquired a novel cis-acting regulatory element for expression during grain filling while the PAPhy_b promoter has maintained the archaic function and drives expression during germination. Brachypodium is the only sequenced Poaceae sharing the PAPhy duplication. As for the Triticeae, the duplication is reflected in a high MGPA of ~4200 FTU/kg in Brachypodium. The sequence conservation of the paralogous loci on Brachypodium chromosomes 1 and 2 does not extend beyond the PAPhy gene. The results indicate that a single-gene segmental duplication may have enabled the evolution of high MGPA by creating functional redundancy of the parent PAPhy gene. This implies that similar MGPA levels may be out of reach in breeding programs for some Poaceae, e.g. maize and rice, whereas Triticeae breeders should focus on PAPhy_a."

"23979580","abstracttext","The long terminal repeat retrotransposon, Magnaporthe gypsy-like element (MAGGY), has been shown to be targeted for cytosine methylation in a subset of Magnaporthe oryzae field isolates. Analysis of the F1 progeny from a genetic cross between methylation-proficient (Br48) and methylation-deficient (GFSI1-7-2) isolates revealed that methylation of the MAGGY element was governed by a single dominant gene. Positional cloning followed by gene disruption and complementation experiments revealed that the responsible gene was the DNA methyltransferase, MoDMT1, an ortholog of Neurospora crassa Dim-2. A survey of MAGGY methylation in 60 Magnaporthe field isolates revealed that 42 isolates from rice, common millet, wheat, finger millet, and buffelgrass were methylation proficient while 18 isolates from foxtail millet, green bristlegrass, Japanese panicgrass, torpedo grass, Guinea grass, and crabgrass were methylation deficient. Phenotypic analyses showed that MoDMT1 plays no major role in development and pathogenicity of the fungus. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the average copy number of genomic MAGGY elements was not significantly different between methylation-deficient and -proficient field isolates even though the levels of MAGGY transcript were generally higher in the former group. MoDMT1 gene sequences in the methylation-deficient isolates suggested that at least three independent mutations were responsible for the loss of MoDMT1 function. Overall, our data suggest that MoDMT1 is not essential for the natural life cycle of the fungus and raise the possibility that the genus Magnaporthe may be losing the mechanism of DNA methylation on the evolutionary time scale."

"23624392","abstracttext","Fatty acids and their derivatives play important roles in plant defense responses. It has been shown that a mutation in a gene encoding one of stearoyl acyl carrier protein fatty acid desaturase isoforms (ssi2 mutant) enhances the resistance of Arabidopsis to multiple pathogens, and similar results were obtained in rice and soybean. However, it is unknown whether the ssi2 mutant is also resistant to powdery mildew (Golovinomyces cichoracearum). In this study, the ssi2 mutant showed enhanced resistance to powdery mildew. Furthermore, we described the cloning and characterization of the TaSSI2 gene (ortholog of AtSSI2) from wheat. Functional analysis of TaSSI2 was performed by overexpressing TaSSI2 in ssi2 mutant of Arabidopsis. The result indicated that ectopic expression of TaSSI2 restored the WT like morphology in the ssi2 background, the 35S:TaSSI2/ssi2 plants accumulated WT-like levels of oleic acid (18:1) and the transcript levels of R genes were significantly lower than that in ssi2 plants. In contrast to the constitutive PR gene expression in ssi2 plants, the transcript accumulation of PR1 and PR2 was similar in the 35S:TaSSI2/ssi2 and wild type both before and after inoculation. Trypan blue staining showed that extensive fungal hyphae and conidiophores were produced in wild-type and 35S:TaSSI2/ssi2 leaves while no visible powdery mildew growth was observed, but dramatic lesions developed at the infection sites in the ssi2 mutant leaves. Our results demonstrated that TaSSI2 is involved in the negative regulation of defense responses in powdery mildew infection, similar to its counterparts in Arabidopsis, indicating a highly conserved function of SSI2 gene in diverse plants."

"24265688","abstracttext","The wheat midge, Sitodiplosis mosellana, is an important pest in Northern China. We tested the hypothesis that the population structure of this species arises during a range expansion over the past 30 years. This study used microsatellite and mitochondrial loci to conduct population genetic analysis of S. mosellana across its distribution range in China. We found strong genetic structure among the 16 studied populations, including two genetically distinct groups (the eastern and western groups), broadly consistent with the geography and habitat fragmentation. These results underline the importance of natural barriers in impeding dispersal and gene flow of S. mosellana populations. Low to moderate genetic diversity among the populations and moderate genetic differentiation (F ST = 0.117) between the two groups were also found. The populations in the western group had lower genetic diversity, higher genetic differentiation and lower gene flow (F ST = 0.116, Nm = 1.89) than those in the eastern group (F ST = 0.049, Nm = 4.91). Genetic distance between populations was positively and significantly correlated with geographic distance (r = 0.56, P<0.001). The population history of this species provided no evidence for population expansion or bottlenecks in any of these populations. Our data suggest that the distribution of genetic diversity, genetic differentiation and population structure of S. mosellana have resulted from a historical event, reflecting its adaptation to diverse habitats and forming two different gene pools. These results may be the outcome of a combination of restricted gene flow due to geographical and environmental factors, population history, random processes of genetic drift and individual dispersal patterns. Given the current risk status of this species in China, this study can offer useful information for forecasting outbreaks and designing effective pest management programs."
"26116860","articletitle","Parallel Domestication of the Heading Date 1 Gene in Cereals."
"26116860","abstracttext","Flowering time is one of the key determinants of crop adaptation to local environments during domestication. However, the genetic basis underlying flowering time is yet to be elucidated in most cereals. Although staple cereals, such as rice, maize, wheat, barley, and sorghum, have spread and adapted to a wide range of ecological environments during domestication, it is yet to be determined whether they have a common genetic basis for flowering time. In this study, we show, through map-based cloning, that flowering time in sorghum is controlled by a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) Heading Date 1 (HD1), located on chromosome 10. The causal gene encodes the CONSTANS gene family which contains a CCT domain. A 5-bp deletion of a minor allele present in the coding sequence leads to a gene frameshift that delays flowering in sorghum. In contrast, in foxtail millet, association mapping of HD1 showed a common causal site with a splicing variant from ""GT"" to ""AT"" that was highly correlated with flowering time. In addition, the rice HD1 gene is known to harbor several causal variants controlling flowering time. These data indicate that the major flowering time QTL HD1 was under parallel domestication in sorghum, foxtail millet, and rice. The pattern of common mixed minor, or even rare, causal alleles in HD1 across different species may be representative of the genetic basis of the domestication syndrome. Furthermore, large DNA sequence analysis of HD1 revealed multiple origins for domesticated sorghum and a single origin for domesticated foxtail millet."

"25519841","abstracttext_background","In addition to gene identification and annotation, repetitive sequence analysis has become an integral part of genome sequencing projects. Identification of repeats is important not only because it improves gene prediction, but also because of the role that repetitive sequences play in determining the structure and evolution of genes and genomes. Several methods using different repeat-finding strategies are available for whole-genome repeat sequence analysis. Four independent approaches were used to identify and characterize the repetitive fraction of the Mycosphaerella graminicola (synonym Zymoseptoria tritici) genome. This ascomycete fungus is a wheat pathogen and its finished genome comprises 21 chromosomes, eight of which can be lost with no obvious effects on fitness so are dispensable."
"25519841","abstracttext_results","Using a combination of four repeat-finding methods, at least 17% of the M. graminicola genome was estimated to be repetitive. Class I transposable elements, that amplify via an RNA intermediate, account for about 70% of the total repetitive content in the M. graminicola genome. The dispensable chromosomes had a higher percentage of repetitive elements as compared to the core chromosomes. Distribution of repeats across the chromosomes also varied, with at least six chromosomes showing a non-random distribution of repetitive elements. Repeat families showed transition mutations and a CpA → TpA dinucleotide bias, indicating the presence of a repeat-induced point mutation (RIP)-like mechanism in M. graminicola. One gene family and two repeat families specific to subtelomeres also were identified in the M. graminicola genome. A total of 78 putative clusters of nested elements was found in the M. graminicola genome. Several genes with putative roles in pathogenicity were found associated with these nested repeat clusters. This analysis of the transposable element content in the finished M. graminicola genome resulted in a thorough and highly curated database of repetitive sequences."
"25519841","abstracttext_conclusions","This comprehensive analysis will serve as a scaffold to address additional biological questions regarding the origin and fate of transposable elements in fungi. Future analyses of the distribution of repetitive sequences in M. graminicola also will be able to provide insights into the association of repeats with genes and their potential role in gene and genome evolution."

"25331793","abstracttext","Nitrification plays a significant role in soil nitrogen cycling, a process in which the first step can be catalyzed by ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In this study, six soil samples with distinct land-use regimes (forestland soil, paddy soil, wheat-planted soil, fruit-planted soil, grassland soil, and rape-planted soil) were collected from Chuzhou city in the Anhui province to elucidate the effects of land use on the abundance and diversity of AOA and AOB. The abundance of the archaeal amoA gene ranged from 2.12 × 10(4) copies per gram of dry soil to 2.57 × 10(5) copies per gram of dry soil, while the abundance of the bacterial amoA gene ranged from 5.58 × 10(4) copies per gram of dry soil to 1.59 × 10(8) copies per gram of dry soil. The grassland and the rape-planted soil samples maintained the highest abundance of the bacterial and archaeal amoA genes, respectively. The abundance of the archaeal amoA gene was positively correlated with the pH (P < 0.05). The ammonia concentrations exhibited a significantly positive relation with the abundance of the bacterial amoA gene (P < 0.01) and the number of OTUs of AOB (P < 0.05). The community composition of AOB was more sensitive to the land-use regimes than that of AOA. The data obtained in this study may be useful to better understand the nitrification process in soils with different land-use regimes."

"25886302","abstracttext_background","The Lolium-Festuca complex incorporates species from the Lolium genera and the broad leaf fescues, both belonging to the subfamily Pooideae. This subfamily also includes wheat, barley, oat and rye, making it extremely important to world agriculture. Species within the Lolium-Festuca complex show very diverse phenotypes, and many of them are related to agronomically important traits. Analysis of sequenced transcriptomes of these non-model species may shed light on the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenotypic diversity."
"25886302","abstracttext_results","We have generated de novo transcriptome assemblies for four species from the Lolium-Festuca complex, ranging from 52,166 to 72,133 transcripts per assembly. We have also predicted a set of proteins and validated it with a high-confidence protein database from three closely related species (H. vulgare, B. distachyon and O. sativa). We have obtained gene family clusters for the four species using OrthoMCL and analyzed their inferred phylogenetic relationships. Our results indicate that VRN2 is a candidate gene for differentiating vernalization and non-vernalization types in the Lolium-Festuca complex. Grouping of the gene families based on their BLAST identity enabled us to divide ortholog groups into those that are very conserved and those that are more evolutionarily relaxed. The ratio of the non-synonumous to synonymous substitutions enabled us to pinpoint protein sequences evolving in response to positive selection. These proteins may explain some of the differences between the more stress tolerant Festuca, and the less stress tolerant Lolium species."
"25886302","abstracttext_conclusions","Our data presents a comprehensive transcriptome sequence comparison between species from the Lolium-Festuca complex, with the identification of potential candidate genes underlying some important phenotypical differences within the complex (such as VRN2). The orthologous genes between the species have a very high %id (91,61%) and the majority of gene families were shared for all of them. It is likely that the knowledge of the genomes will be largely transferable between species within the complex."

"26454013","abstracttext","Deciphering the genetic bases of pathogen adaptation to its host is a key question in ecology and evolution. To understand how the fungus Magnaporthe oryzae adapts to different plants, we sequenced eight M. oryzae isolates differing in host specificity (rice, foxtail millet, wheat, and goosegrass), and one Magnaporthe grisea isolate specific of crabgrass. Analysis of Magnaporthe genomes revealed small variation in genome sizes (39-43 Mb) and gene content (12,283-14,781 genes) between isolates. The whole set of Magnaporthe genes comprised 14,966 shared families, 63% of which included genes present in all the nine M. oryzae genomes. The evolutionary relationships among Magnaporthe isolates were inferred using 6,878 single-copy orthologs. The resulting genealogy was mostly bifurcating among the different host-specific lineages, but was reticulate inside the rice lineage. We detected traces of introgression from a nonrice genome in the rice reference 70-15 genome. Among M. oryzae isolates and host-specific lineages, the genome composition in terms of frequencies of genes putatively involved in pathogenicity (effectors, secondary metabolism, cazome) was conserved. However, 529 shared families were found only in nonrice lineages, whereas the rice lineage possessed 86 specific families absent from the nonrice genomes. Our results confirmed that the host specificity of M. oryzae isolates was associated with a divergence between lineages without major gene flow and that, despite the strong conservation of gene families between lineages, adaptation to different hosts, especially to rice, was associated with the presence of a small number of specific gene families. All information was gathered in a public database (http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/gemo)."

"27442506","abstracttext","The aim of the present study was to dissect the genetic inheritance and interplay of root, shoot and heading attributes for a better understanding of these traits in crop production. For this, we utilized quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate gene analysis approach using a second filial (F2) population originated from a cross between spring cultivar Cheri and wild barley accession ICB181160. The F2 population comprising 182 plants was phenotyped for root dry weight (RDW), root volume (RV), root length (RL) and shoot dry weight (SDW), tiller number per plant (TIL) and days to heading (HEA). In parallel, this population was genotyped using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers distributed across the whole genome. Marker by trait analysis revealed 16 QTL for root and shoot traits localized on chromosomes 1H, 3H, 4H, 5H and 7H. The strongest and a common QTL effect for root, shoot and heading traits was identified on chromosome 7H at the putative region of Vrn-H3 gene. Later, we have established PCR based gene specific marker HvVrnH3 revealing polymorphism for early heading Vrn-H3 allele in Cheri and late heading allele vrn-H3 in ICB181160. Genotyping of these alleles revealed a clear co-segregation of early heading Vrn-H3 allele with lower root and shoot attributes, while late heading vrn-H3 allele with more TIL and higher root biomass suggesting a primary insight on the function of Vrn-H3 gene beyond flowering. Genetic interactions of vernalization genes Vrn-H3 with Vrn-H2 and Vrn-H1 also suggested the major role of Vrn-H3 alleles in determining root and shoot trait variations in barley. We believe, these data provide an opportunity for further research to test a precise significance of early heading on yield components and root associated sustainability in crops like barley and wheat."
"28419377","articletitle","Gene-Tree Reconciliation with MUL-Trees to Resolve Polyploidy Events."
"28419377","abstracttext","Polyploidy can have a huge impact on the evolution of species, and it is a common occurrence, especially in plants. The two types of polyploids-autopolyploids and allopolyploids-differ in the level of divergence between the genes that are brought together in the new polyploid lineage. Because allopolyploids are formed via hybridization, the homoeologous copies of genes within them are at least as divergent as orthologs in the parental species that came together to form them. This means that common methods for estimating the parental lineages of allopolyploidy events are not accurate, and can lead to incorrect inferences about the number of gene duplications and losses. Here, we have adapted an algorithm for topology-based gene-tree reconciliation to work with multi-labeled trees (MUL-trees). By definition, MUL-trees have some tips with identical labels, which makes them a natural representation of the genomes of polyploids. Using this new reconciliation algorithm we can: accurately place allopolyploidy events on a phylogeny, identify the parental lineages that hybridized to form allopolyploids, distinguish between allo-, auto-, and (in most cases) no polyploidy, and correctly count the number of duplications and losses in a set of gene trees. We validate our method using gene trees simulated with and without polyploidy, and revisit the history of polyploidy in data from the clades including both baker's yeast and bread wheat. Our re-analysis of the yeast data confirms the allopolyploid origin and parental lineages previously identified for this group. The method presented here should find wide use in the growing number of genomes from species with a history of polyploidy. [Polyploidy; reconciliation; whole-genome duplication.]."
"28642761","articletitle","Overexpression of BdMATE Gene Improves Aluminum Tolerance in Setaria viridis ."
"28642761","abstracttext","Acidic soils are distributed worldwide, predominantly in tropical and subtropical areas, reaching around 50% of the arable soil. This type of soil strongly reduces crop production, mainly because of the presence of aluminum, which has its solubility increased at low pH levels. A well-known physiological mechanism used by plants to cope with Al stress involves activation of membrane transporters responsible for organic acid anions secretion from the root apex to the rhizosphere, which chelate Al, preventing its absorption by roots. In sorghum, a membrane transporter gene belonging to multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family was identified and characterized as an aluminum-activated citrate transporter gene responsible for Al tolerance in this crop. Setaria viridis is an emerging model for C4 species and it is an important model to validate some genes for further C4 crops transformation, such as sugarcane, maize, and wheat. In the present work, Setaria viridis was used as a model plant to overexpress a newly identified MATE gene from Brachypodium distachyon ( BdMATE ), closely related to SbMATE , for aluminum tolerance assays. Transgenic S. viridis plants overexpressing a BdMATE presented an improved Al tolerance phenotype, characterized by sustained root growth and exclusion of aluminum from the root apex in transgenic plants, as confirmed by hematoxylin assay. In addition, transgenic plants showed higher root citrate exudation into the rhizosphere, suggesting that Al tolerance improvement in these plants could be related to the chelation of the metal by the organic acid anion. These results suggest that BdMATE gene can be used to transform C4 crops of economic importance with improved aluminum tolerance."

"29441081","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is an important disease of cereals. It is caused by one species, Blumeria graminis , which is divided into formae speciales each of which is highly specialized to one host. Recently, a new form capable of growing on triticale ( B.g. triticale ) has emerged through hybridization between wheat and rye mildews ( B.g. tritici and B.g. secalis , respectively). In this work, we used RNA sequencing to study the molecular basis of host adaptation in B.g. triticale . We analyzed gene expression in three B.g. tritici isolates, two B.g. secalis isolates and two B.g. triticale isolates and identified a core set of putative effector genes that are highly expressed in all formae speciales . We also found that the genes differentially expressed between isolates of the same form as well as between different formae speciales were enriched in putative effectors. Their coding genes belong to several families including some which contain known members of mildew avirulence ( Avr ) and suppressor ( Svr ) genes. Based on these findings we propose that effectors play an important role in host adaptation that is mechanistically based on Avr-Resistance gene-Svr interactions. We also found that gene expression in the B.g. triticale hybrid is mostly conserved with the parent-of-origin, but some genes inherited from B.g. tritici showed a B.g. secalis -like expression. Finally, we identified 11 unambiguous cases of putative effector genes with hybrid-specific, non-parent of origin gene expression, and we propose that they are possible determinants of host specialization in triticale mildew. These data suggest that altered expression of multiple effector genes, in particular Avr and Svr related factors, might play a role in mildew host adaptation based on hybridization."

"29527447","abstracttext","Myceliophthora thermophila (ATCC 42464) is a thermophilic fungus that produces cellulolytic enzymes with high thermal stability. Unlike its mesophile counterparts, study on gene expression regulation of cellulolytic enzymes in M. thermophila is inadequate. This work identified the function of MHR1, a putative transcription regulator of cellulolytic enzymes in M. thermophila that was found through RNA-Seq based gene expression profile analysis. RNA interference was used to study the role of MHR1. A recombinant plasmid, pUC19-P pdc - mhr1 -T pdc , which contained the RNAi sequence for mhr1 was constructed and transformed into M. thermophila . One of the transformants, MtR5, in which the RNA interference efficiency was the highest, was used for the following studies. In the mhr1 -silenced strain MtR5, the filter paper hydrolyzing activity was 1.33-fold; β-1, 4-endoglucanase activity was 1.65-fold; and xylanase activity was 1.48-fold higher than those of the parental strain after induction, respectively, by wheat straw powder. qRT-PCR showed that gene expression of cbh1 , cbh2 , egl3 and xyr1 were 9.56-, 37.36-, 56.14- and 28.30-fold higher in MtR5 than in wild type, respectively. Our findings suggest that the transcription factor MHR1 of M. thermophila can repress cellulase and xylanase activities. Silenced mhr1 results in increased expression not only of the main cellulase genes, but also of the positive regulatory gene xyr1 . This work is relevant to the development of M. thermophila as an industrial production host for cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzymes, which could be used to degrade a wide range of different biomass, converting lignocellulosic feedstock into sugar precursors for biofuels."

"29734589","abstracttext","Long-term studies that advance our mechanistic understanding of biochar (BC)‑nitrogen (N) interactions in agricultural soils are lacking. In this study, soil potential nitrification rates (PNR), the abundance and composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) communities following 4-year of BC application were investigated using the shaken-slurry procedure and molecular sequencing techniques for an acidic Oxisol (QU) and an alkaline Cambisol (YU). Soils were obtained from an outdoor soil column experiment with straw-BC application rates of 0 (BC0), 2.25 (BC2.25) and 11.3 (BC11.3) Mgha -1 per cropping season for eight consecutive wheat/millet seasons. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing techniques were performed to quantify and sequence amoA gene copies and composition of AOA and AOB. Results showed that QU had lower PNR and a higher ratio of amoA gene copies of AOA to AOB than YU, PNR of QU with BC application was significantly associated with the amoA gene of AOB. Similar to previous short-term findings, BC application enhanced QU soil nitrification, which may be explained by the significant increase in AOB abundance and a shift in AOB community structure from Nitrosospira cluster 2 toward cluster 3, along with the disappearance of some obligate acidophile AOA groups, leading to the appearance of ammonia-oxidizers from neutral-alkaline soils in BC-amended acid soils. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) showed that soil pH was the most important factor driving shifts in ammonia-oxidizers composition. Although BC application did not have significant effects on PNR in YU, BC11.3 decreased AOA and AOB gene copies and influenced the relative abundance of community structure. Our findings represent the first investigation of long-term BC effects on AOA and AOB communities in agricultural soils using 454 high-throughput pyrosequencing, showing that BC application can alter soil characteristics and influence ammonia oxidizer community composition, abundance, especially in acid soils."

In perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) the only PAs that have been identified are the thesinine-rhamnoside group, which displays significant genetic variation. Homospermidine synthase (HSS) has evolved from deoxyhypusine synthase (DHS) and catalyses the first step in the PA pathway, making it a key candidate for the investigation of genes influencing observed PA trait variation."
"29625552","abstracttext_results","During PCR amplification and sequence analysis of DHS we identified two putative HSS genes in perennial ryegrass. One of the genes (LpHSS1) was absent in some perennial ryegrass plants. Thesinine-rhamnoside levels were measured using liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry in a diverse association mapping population, consisting of 693 plants free of fungal endophytic symbionts. Association tests that accounted for population structure identified a significant association of absence of the LpHSS1 gene with lower levels of thesinine-rhamnoside PAs. HSS-like gene sequences were identified for other grass species of the Poaceae, including tall fescue, wheat, maize and sorghum."
"29625552","abstracttext_conclusion","HSS is situated at the crucial first step in the PA pathway making it an important candidate gene for investigation of involvement in PA phenotypic variation. In this study, PA level in perennial ryegrass was strongly associated with the presence or absence of the LpHSS1 gene. A genetic marker, developed for the presence/absence of LpHSS1, may be used for marker-assisted breeding to either lower or increase PAs in breeding populations of perennial or Italian ryegrass to investigate a potential role in the deterrence of herbivore pests. The presence of HSS-like genes in several other Poaceae species suggests that PA biosynthesis may occur in plant family members beyond perennial ryegrass and tall fescue and identifies a potential route for manipulating PA levels."

"29710598","abstracttext","The application of dairy wastewater to agricultural soils is a widely used practice to irrigate crops and recycle nutrients. In this study, small-scale field plots were irrigated monthly (6 times) with dairy wastewater (100%), wastewater diluted to 50% with irrigation (canal) water, and diluted wastewater spiked with copper sulfate (50 mg Cu L -1 ), while control plots were irrigated with canal water. In addition, half of all plots were either planted with wheat or were left as bare soil. Biweekly soil samples were collected during this period and processed to determine the occurrence and abundance of antibiotic resistance genes [bla CTX-M-1 , erm(B), sul1, tet(B), tet(M), and tet(X)] and a class 1 integron-integrase gene (intI1) via quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Only sul1 and tet(X) were detected in soil (3 out of 32 samples) before the wastewater treatments were applied. However, the occurrence and relative abundance (normalized to 16S rRNA gene copies) of most genes [erm(B), intI1, sul1, and tet(M)] increased dramatically after wastewater irrigation and levels were maintained during the entire study period. bla CTX-M-1 was the only gene not detected in wastewater-treated soils, which is likely related to its absence in the dairy wastewater. Relative gene levels in soil were found to be statistically similar among the treatments in most cases, regardless of the wastewater percentage applied and presence or absence of plants. The key result from this study is that dairy wastewater irrigation significantly enlarges the reservoir of ARGs and intI1 in soils, while detection of these genes rarely occurred in soil irrigated only with canal water. In addition, elevated levels of Cu in the wastewater and treated soil did not produce a concomitant increase of the ARG levels."

The wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici causes Septoria tritici blotch, a foliar disease which is a significant threat to global food security. Currently, there is limited knowledge of the secondary metabolite arsenal produced by Z. tritici, which significantly restricts mechanistic understanding of infection. In this study, we analyzed the genome of Z. tritici isolate IP0323 to identify putative secondary metabolite biosynthetic gene clusters, and used comparative genomics to predict their encoded products."
"28818040","abstracttext_results","We identified 32 putative secondary metabolite clusters. These were physically enriched at subtelomeric regions, which may facilitate diversification of cognate products by rapid gene rearrangement or mutations.

The Z. tritici genome also contains several isoprenoid biosynthetic gene clusters, including one with high similarity to a carotenoid/opsin producing locus in several fungi. Furthermore, we identify putative phytotoxin biosynthetic clusters, suggesting Z. tritici can produce an epipolythiodioxopiperazine, and a polyketide and non-ribosomal peptide with predicted structural similarities to fumonisin and the Alternaria alternata AM-toxin, respectively. Interrogation of an existing transcriptional dataset suggests stage specific deployment of numerous predicted loci during infection, indicating an important role of these secondary metabolites in Z. tritici disease."

However, analysis of the majority of secondary metabolite loci did not enable prediction of a cluster product, and consequently the capacity of these loci to play as yet undetermined roles in disease or other stages of the Z. tritici lifecycle is significant. These data will drive future experimentation for determining the role of these clusters and cognate secondary metabolite products in Z. tritici virulence, and may lead to discovery of novel bioactive molecules."

"32594344","abstracttext","The relative quantification of gene expression is mainly realized through reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). However, the accuracy of this technique is deeply influenced by the expression stability of the reference genes used for data normalization. Therefore, the selection of suitable reference genes for a given experimental condition is a prerequisite in gene expression studies. Dichelops melacanthus (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) is an important phloem sap-sucking insect pest of soybean, wheat, and maize in Brazil. Most of the genetic and molecular biology studies require gene expression analysis. Nevertheless, there are no reports about reference genes for RT-qPCR data normalization in D. melacanthus. In this study, we evaluated the expression stability of nine candidate reference genes (nadh, sdhb, gapdh, fau, ef1a, rpl9, ube4a, gus and rps23) in different developmental stages, body parts, sex, starvation-induced stress and dsRNA exposure by RefFinder software that integrates the statistical algorithms geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and ΔCt method. Our results showed that ef1a and nadh are the most stable reference genes for developmental stages, fau and rps23 for sex, ube4a and rps23 for body parts, rpl9 and fau for starvation stress, and nadh and sdhb for dsRNA exposure treatment. The reference genes selected in this work will be useful for further RT-qPCR analyses on D. melacanthus, facilitating future gene expression studies that can provide a better understanding of the developmental, physiological, and molecular processes of this important insect pest. Moreover, the knowledge gained from these studies can be helpful to design effective and sustainable pest management strategies."

"32480470","abstracttext","By analysing the cDNA microarray of the salt tolerant mutant of wheat RH8706-49 under salinity stress, our results showed an expressed sequence tag fragment and acquired an unknown gene (designated as TaBAG) with a BAG conserved domain through electronic cloning and RT-PCR technology. The gene was registered into GenBank (No. FJ599765). After homologous alignment analysis, electronic cloning, and amplifying with RT-PCR, the other gene with a BAG conserved domain, TaBAG2, was obtained and registered into GenBank (No. GU471210). Quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that TaBAG2 expression was induced by saline and heat stress. TaBAG gene expression under salinity stress increased remarkably but showed an insignificant response to heat stress. The adversity stress detection results showed that Arabidopsis overexpressing TaBAG and TaBAG2 exhibited an obvious salt tolerance increase. Under heat stress, Arabidopsis overexpressing TaBAG2 showed increased heat tolerance; however, the heat tolerance of Arabidopsis overexpressing TaBAG did not vary significantly under heat stress. Subcellular localisation results demonstrated that TaBAGs were mainly located in the cytoplasm and the cell nucleus. We applied fluorescence complementation and yeast two-hybrid technique to prove that TaBAG2 can obviously bond with TaHsp70 and TaCaMs. After the respective mutation of aspartic acid (D) and arginine (R) at high conservation in BAG domain of TaBAG2, the bonding interaction between TaBAG2 and TaHsp70 disappeared, indicating that the two amino acids were the key loci for the interaction between TaBAG2 and TaHsp70. Heat tolerance detection results demonstrated that the heat tolerance of Arabidopsis overexpressing and cotransfected with TaBAG2 and TaHsp70 was much higher than that of Arabidopsis overexpressing TaBAG2 and Arabidopsis overexpressing TaHSP70. This finding implies that the synergistic use of TaBAG2 and TaHSP70 can improve heat tolerance of plants."

"30121873","abstracttext_main conclusion","Expression of TaSnRK2.7 promoter is strongly induced under abiotic stress and could be used as a valuable tool for improving plant stress resistance via transgenic techniques. The sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) gene family plays pivotal roles in response to abiotic stresses (drought, salinity and cold). Here, we studied the expression of five wheat TaSnRK2.7 promoter-5'-deletion constructs (- 2547, - 1621, - 806, - 599, and - 254) fused to beta-glucuronidase (GUS) in Arabidopsis. Tissue-expression analysis revealed that the - 254 to ATG fragment was sufficient for inducing GUS expression in hypocotyls. Additionally, the - 806 to - 599 and - 2547 to - 1621 fragments contained leaf- and root-specific elements, respectively. Deletion analysis showed that these fragments were unresponsive to ABA treatment, suggesting that TaSnRK2.7 participates in an ABA-independent signaling pathway. Assays examining stress responses of constructs demonstrated that the - 599 to - 254 and - 806 to - 599 fragments contained elements responsive to abiotic and osmotic stress, respectively. The TaSnRK2.7 promoter contained enhancers from - 806 to - 254 and - 2547 to - 1621, while the - 1621 to - 806 fragment contained negative regulatory elements that restrict root and leaf gene expression in response to abiotic stress. Furthermore, under drought and salt stress, the TaSnRK2.7 promoter conferred greater gene expression in leaves than the rd29A promoter, even though both were induced by abiotic stress. These findings enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind TaSnRK2.7 action, which should prove useful in transgenic studies investigating stress-induced gene expression."

"30861026","abstracttext","In plants, the enzyme CCD8 (carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 8) is involved in the synthesis of an important hormone, strigolactone, and therefore, plays an important role in controlling growth and development. Using cDNA and protein sequence derived from the gene ZmCCD8 from maize, we identified putative orthologs of the gene encoding CCD8 in six other monocots and eight dicots; the sequence similarity ranged from 52-75.9% at the gene level and 60.9-93.7% at the protein level. The average length of the gene was ~3.3 kb (range: 2.08 to 3.98 kb), although the number of introns within the genes differed (4 or 5 in dicots and 3 or 4 in monocots, except in T. urartu with 6 introns). Several cis-acting regulatory elements were identified in the promoters of CCD8 genes, which are known to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses. The N-terminal end (up to ~70 amino acids) of CCD8 proteins was highly variable due to insertions, deletions and mismatches. The variation in genes and proteins were particularly conspicuous in T. urartu and Ae. tauschii among the monocots and A. thaliana and P. persica among the dicots. In CCD8 proteins, 12 motifs were also identified, of which 6 were novel; 4 of these novel motifs occurred in all the 15 species. The 3D structures of proteins had the characteristic features of the related enzyme apocarotenoid oxygenase (ACO) of Synechocystis (a representative of cyanobacteria). The results of qRT-PCR in wheat revealed that under phosphorous (P)-starved condition (relative to expression under optimum P used as control), the expression of TaCCD8 genes increased ~37 fold in root tissue of the cultivar C306 and ~33 fold in shoot tissue of the cultivar HUW468 (the two cultivars differed in their P-use efficiency). This suggested that expression of TaCCD8 genes is genotype-dependent and tissue-specific and is regulated under different levels of P supply."

"30298213","abstracttext","Development of leaf rust-resistant cultivars is a priority during wheat breeding, since leaf rust causes major losses in yield. Resistance against leaf rust due to Lr genes is partly controlled by epigenetic modifications including histone acetylation that is known to respond to biotic/abiotic stresses. In the present study, enrichment of H3K4ac and H3K9ac in promoters of six defense responsive genes (N-acetyltransferase, WRKY 40, WRKY 70, ASR1, Peroxidase 12 and Sarcosine oxidase) was compared with their expression in a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) for the gene Lr28 following inoculation with leaf rust pathotype '77-5'; ChIP-qPCR was used for this purpose. The proximal and distal promoters of these genes contained a number of motifs that are known to respond to biotic stresses. The enrichment of two acetylation marks changed with passage of time; changes in expression of two of the six genes (N-acetyltransferase and peroxidase12), largely matched with changes in H3K4/H3K9 acetylation patterns of the two promoter regions. For example, enrichment of both the marks matched with higher expression of N-acetyltransferase gene in susceptible NIL and the deacetylation (H3K4ac) largely matched with reduced gene expression in resistant NIL. In peroxidase12, enrichment of H3K4ac and H3K9ac largely matched with higher expression in both the NILs. In the remaining four genes, changes in H3 acetylation did not always match with gene expression levels. This indicated complexity in the regulation of the expression of these remaining four genes, which may be controlled by other epigenetic/genetic regulatory mechanisms that need further analysis."

"32407360","abstracttext","Rumen protected amino acids inclusion in ewes' diets has been proposed to enhance their innate immunity. The objective of this work was to determine the impact of dietary supplementation with rumen-protected methionine or lysine, as well as with a combination of these amino acids in two different ratios, on the expression of selected key-genes (NLRs, MyD88, TRIF, MAPK-1, IRF-3, JunD, TRAF-3, IRF-5, IL-1α, IL-10, IKK-α, STAT-3 and HO-1). Thus, sixty Chios dairy ewes (Ovis aries) were assigned to one of the following five dietary treatments (12 animals/ treatment): A: basal diet consist of concentrates, wheat straw and alfalfa hay (control group); B: basal diet +6.0 g/head rumen-protected methionine; C: basal diet + 5.0 g/head rumen-protected lysine; D: basal diet +6.0 g/head rumen-protected methionine + 5.0 g/head rumen-protected lysine and E: basal diet +12.0 g/head rumen-protected methionine + 5.0 g/head rumen-protected lysine. The results revealed a significant downregulation of relative transcript level of the IL-1α gene in the neutrophils of C and in monocytes of D ewes compared with the control. Significantly lower mRNA transcript accumulation was also observed for the MyD88 gene in the neutrophils of ewes fed with lysine only (C). The mRNA relative expression levels of JunD gene were highly induced in the monocytes, while those of IL-10 and HO-1 genes were declined in the neutrophils of ewes fed with the C and D diets compared with the control. Lower transcript levels of STAT-3 gene were observed in the neutrophils of ewes fed with either C or with E diets in comparison with the control. In conclusion, our results suggest that the dietary supplementation of ewes with rumen-protected amino acids, down regulate the expression of some genes involved in the pro-inflammatory signalling."

"30673892","abstracttext","Brinjal or eggplant (Solanum melongena L.) is an important solanaceous edible crop, and salt stress adversely affects its growth, development, and overall productivity. To cope with excess salinity, vacuolar Na + /H + antiporters provide the best mechanism for ionic homeostasis in plants under salt stress. We generated transgenic eggplants by introducing wheat TaNHX2 gene that encodes a vacuolar Na + /H + antiporter in to the eggplant genome via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using pBin438 vector that harbors double35S:TaNHX2 to confer salinity tolerance. Polymerase chain reaction and southern hybridization confirmed the presence and integration of TaNHX2 gene in T 1 transgenic plants. Southern positive transgenic eggplants showed varied levels of TaNHX2 transcripts as evident by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. Stress-inducible expression of TaNHX2 significantly improved growth performance and Na + and K + contents from leaf and roots tissues of T 2 transgenic eggplants under salt stress, compared to non-transformed plants. Furthermore, T 2 transgenic eggplants displayed the stable leaf relative water content and chlorophyll content, proline accumulation, improved photosynthetic efficiency, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductivity than the non-transformed plants under salinity stress (200 mM NaCl). Data showed that the T 2 transgenic lines revealed that reduction in MDA content, hydrogen peroxide, and oxygen radical production associated with the significant increase of antioxidant enzyme activity in transgenic eggplants than non-transformed plants under salt stress (200 mM NaCl). This study suggested that the TaNHX2 gene plays an important regulatory role in conferring salinity tolerance of transgenic eggplant and thus may serve as a useful candidate gene for improving salinity tolerance in other vegetable crops."

"31164922","abstracttext_background","Solid-state fermentation (SSF) mimics the natural decay environment of soil fungi and can be employed to investigate the production of plant biomass-degrading enzymes. However, knowledge on the transcriptional regulation of fungal genes during SSF remains limited. Herein, transcriptional profiling was performed on the filamentous fungus Penicillium oxalicum strain HP7-1 cultivated in medium containing wheat bran plus rice straw (WR) under SSF (WR_SSF) and submerged fermentation (WR_SmF; control) conditions. Novel key transcription factors (TFs) regulating fungal cellulase and xylanase gene expression during SSF were identified via comparative transcriptomic and genetic analyses."
"31164922","abstracttext_results","Expression of major cellulase genes was higher under WR_SSF condition than that under WR_SmF, but the expression of genes involved in the citric acid cycle was repressed under WR_SSF condition. Fifty-six candidate regulatory genes for cellulase production were screened out from transcriptomic profiling of P . oxalicum HP7-1 for knockout experiments in the parental strain ∆ PoxKu70 , resulting in 43 deletion mutants including 18 constructed in the previous studies. Enzyme activity assays revealed 14 novel regulatory genes involved in cellulase production in P . oxalicum during SSF. Remarkably, deletion of the essential regulatory gene PoxMBF1 , encoding Multiprotein Bridging Factor 1, resulted in doubled cellulase and xylanase production at 2 days after induction during both SSF and SmF. PoxMBF1 dynamically and differentially regulated transcription of a subset of cellulase and xylanase genes during SSF and SmF, and conferred stress resistance.

"31293612","abstracttext","Genetic engineered male sterility has different applications, ranging from hybrid seed production to bioconfinement of transgenes in genetic modified crops. The impact of this technology is currently patent in a wide range of crops, including legumes, which has helped to deal with the challenges of global food security. Production of engineered male sterile plants by expression of a ribonuclease gene under the control of an anther- or pollen-specific promoter has proven to be an efficient way to generate pollen-free elite cultivars. In the last years, we have been studying the genetic control of flower development in legumes and several genes that are specifically expressed in a determinate floral organ were identified. Pisum sativum ENDOTHECIUM 1 ( PsEND1 ) is a pea anther-specific gene displaying very early expression in the anther primordium cells. This expression pattern has been assessed in both model plants and crops (tomato, tobacco, oilseed rape, rice, wheat) using genetic constructs carrying the PsEND1 promoter fused to the uidA reporter gene. This promoter fused to the barnase gene produces full anther ablation at early developmental stages, preventing the production of mature pollen grains in all plant species tested. Additional effects produced by the early anther ablation in the PsEND1 :: barnase-barstar plants, with interesting biotechnological applications, have also been described, such as redirection of resources to increase vegetative growth, reduction of the need for deadheading to extend the flowering period, or elimination of pollen allergens in ornamental plants ( Kalanchoe, Pelargonium ). Moreover, early anther ablation in transgenic PsEND1::barnase-barstar tomato plants promotes the developing of the ovaries into parthenocarpic fruits due to the absence of signals generated during the fertilization process and can be considered an efficient tool to promote fruit set and to produce seedless fruits. In legumes, the production of new hybrid cultivars will contribute to enhance yield and productivity by exploiting the hybrid vigor generated. The PsEND1::barnase-barstar construct could be also useful to generate parental lines in hybrid breeding approaches to produce new cultivars in different legume species."

"32880513","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust (causal organism: Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ; Pgt ) is an important fungal disease that causes significant yield losses in barley. The deployment of resistant cultivars is the most effective means for controlling this disease. Stem rust evaluations of a diverse collection of wild barley ( Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum ) identified two Jordanian accessions (WBDC094 and WBDC238) with resistance to a virulent pathotype (Pgt-HKHJC) from the USA. To elucidate the genetics of stem rust resistance, both accessions were crossed to the susceptible landrace Hiproly. Segregation ratios of F 2 and F 3 progeny indicated that a single dominant gene confers resistance to Pgt -HKHJC. Molecular mapping of the resistance locus was performed in the Hiproly x WBDC238 F 2 population based on 3,329 SNP markers generated by genotyping by sequencing. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis positioned the resistance gene to the long arm of chromosome 3H between the physical/genetic positions of 683.8 Mbp/172.9 cM and 693.7 Mbp/176.0 cM. Since this resistance gene is novel, it was assigned the new gene locus symbol of Rpg7 with a corresponding allele symbol of Rpg7.i . At the seedling stage, Rpg7 confers resistance against a number of other important Pgt pathotypes from the USA (MCCFC, QCCJB, and TTTTF) and Africa (TTKSK) as well as an isolate (92-MN-90) of the rye stem rust pathogen ( P. graminis f. sp. secalis ) from Minnesota. The resistance conferred by Rpg7 can be readily transferred into breeding programs due to its simple inheritance and clear phenotypic expression."

The genes are important regulators of cytokinin content and take part in growth and development, with a major impact on yield-related traits. The goal of this research was to test whether these genes might be differentially expressed in the field compared to laboratory conditions and consequently differently affect plant development and yield."
"33121443","abstracttext_results","We compared expression and crosstalk of the TaCKX GFMs and TaNAC2-5A gene in modern varieties grown in a growth chamber (GC) and in the field and looked for differences in their impact on yield-related traits. The TaNAC2-5A gene was included in the research since it was expected to play an important role in co-regulation of these genes. The range of relative expression levels of TaCKX GFMs and TaNAC2-5A gene among tested cultivars was from 5 for TaCKX8 to more than 100 for TaCKX9 in the GC and from 6 for TaCKX8 to 275 for TaCKX10 in the field. The range was similar for four of them in the GC, but was much higher for seven others and TaNAC2-5A in the field. The TaCKX GFMs and TaNAC2-5A form co-expression groups, which differ depending on growth conditions. Consequently, the genes also differently regulate yield-related traits in the GC and in the field. TaNAC2-5A took part in negative regulation of tiller number and CKX activity in seedling roots only in controlled GC conditions. Grain number and grain yield were negatively regulated by TaCKX10 in the GC but positively by TaCKX8 and others in the field. Some of the genes, which were expressed in seedling roots, negatively influenced tiller number and positively regulated seedling root weight, CKX activity in the spikes, thousand grain weight (TGW) as well as formation of semi-empty spikes."

"33101340","abstracttext","American sloughgrass ( Beckmannia syzigachne Steud.) is one of the most troublesome weeds infesting wheat and canola fields in China. Some biotypes cannot be controlled, either by acetolactate synthase (ALS) or acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors, which are the main herbicides for controlling this weed. However, very few studies have investigated multiple resistance mechanism in B. syzigachne . In this study, a B. syzigachne biotype with a high resistance to ALS inhibitors we have reported was also showed relatively lower resistance to ACCase inhibitors, with a resistance index around 7. RNA-seq analysis was used to investigate the factors responsible for multiple resistance, and 60,108 unigenes were assembled by de novo transcriptome assembly and then annotated across eight databases. A Pro-197-Ser mutation was identified in the ALS gene by SNPs analysis and validated by PCR, while no mutation was identified in the ACCase gene. Nineteen candidate metabolic genes were screened and their overexpression was confirmed by qPCR. The expression of GST-T3 and GST-U6 in resistant plants ranged from 7.5- to 109.4-folds than that in susceptible ones at different times after two kinds of herbicide treatment. In addition, GST activities in resistant plants were 3.0-5.0 times higher than that in susceptible plants. Other novel resistance factors also showed high correlation with multiple resistance which included four genes encoding disease resistance proteins, a transcription factor ( MYC3 ), and one gene conferring blight resistance. In this research, a B. syzigachne biotype was confirmed to have evolved multiple resistance to ACCase and ALS inhibitors. The Pro-197-Ser mutation in ALS gene and high-level GST activities were confirmed responsible for the multiple resistance. Characterized disease-resistance proteins, transcription factor, and blight-resistance proteins may play an essential role in these multiple herbicide resistance."

"32627097","abstracttext_key message","Present study revealed a complex relationship among histone H3 methylation (examined using H3K4/K27me3 marks), cytosine DNA methylation and differential gene expression during Lr28 mediated leaf rust resistance in wheat. During the present study, genome-wide histone modifications were examined in a pair of near isogenic lines (NILs) (with and without Lr28 in the background of cv. HD2329). The two histone marks used included H3K4me3 (an activation mark) and H3K27me3 (a repression mark). The results were compared with levels of expression (using RNA-seq) and DNA methylation (MeDIP) data obtained using the same pair of NILs. Some of the salient features of the present study include the following: (i) large scale differential binding sites (DBS) were available for only H3K4me3 in the susceptible cultivar, but for both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 in its resistant NIL; (ii) DBSs for H3K27me3 mark were more abundant (> 80%) in intergenic regions, whereas DBSs for H3K4me3 were distributed in all genomic regions including exons, introns, intergenic, TTS (transcription termination sites) and promoters; (iii) fourteen (14) genes associated with DBSs showed co-localization for both the marks; (iv) only a small fraction (7% for H3K4me3 and 12% for H3K27me3) of genes associated with DBSs matched with the levels of gene expression inferred from RNA-seq data; (v) validation studies using qRT-PCR were conducted on 26 selected representative genes; results for only 11 genes could be validated. The proteins encoded by important genes involved in promoting infection included domains generally carried by R gene proteins such as Mlo like protein, protein kinases and purple acid phosphatase. Similarly, proteins encoded by genes involved in resistance included those carrying domains for lectin kinase, R gene, aspartyl protease, etc. Overall, the results suggest a very complex network of downstream genes that are expressed during compatible and incompatible interactions; some of the genes identified during the present study may be used in future validation studies involving RNAi/overexpression approaches."

"32723863","abstracttext","The ability to tailor alterations in genomes, including plant genomes, in a site-specific manner has been greatly advanced through approaches that reduced the complexity and time of genome sequencing along with development of gene editing technologies. These technologies provide a valuable foundation for studies of gene function, metabolic engineering, and trait modification for crop improvement. Development of genome editing methodologies began ∼20 years ago, first with meganucleases and followed by zinc finger nucleases, transcriptional activator-like effector nucleases and, most recently, clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein (Cas) (CRISPR/Cas), which is by far the most utilized method. The premise of CRISPR/Cas centers on the cleaving of one or both DNA strands by a Cas protein, an endonuclease, followed by mending of the DNA by repair mechanisms inherent in cells. Its user-friendly construct design, greater flexibility in targeting genomic regions, and cost-effective attributes have resulted in it being widely adopted and revolutionizing precise modification of the genomes of many organisms. Indeed, the CRISPR/Cas system has been utilized for gene editing in many plant species, including important food crops, such as maize, wheat, rice, and potatoes. This review summarizes the various approaches, including the most recent designs being used to make modifications from as small as a single-base-pair change to insertion of DNA fragments. On the gene expression level, strategies are presented that make it possible to knock out or modulate through activation and repression. Also discussed are prerequisites necessary for CRISPR/Cas-mediated editing as well as the current challenges."

This study made detailed analysis on evolutionary relationship between PYL family members, collinearity, synteny, gene structure, protein motifs, cis-regulatory elements (CREs), SNP variations, miRNAs targeting PYLs and expression profiles in different tissues and stress responses."
"32998689","abstracttext_results","Based on sequence homology with Arabidopsis PYL proteins, we identified a total of 13 PYLs in rice (BOP clade) and maize (PACCMAD clade), while other members of BOP (wheat - each diploid genome, barley and Brachypodium) and PACCMAD (sorghum and foxtail millet) have 8-9 PYLs. The phylogenetic analysis divided PYLs into three subfamilies that are structurally and functionally conserved across species. Gene structure and motif analysis of OsPYLs revealed that members of each subfamily have similar gene and motif structure. Segmental duplication appears be the driving force for the expansion of PYLs, and the majority of the PYLs underwent evolution under purifying selection in rice. 32 unique potential miRNAs that might target PYLs were identified in rice. Thus, the predicted regulation of PYLs through miRNAs in rice is more elaborate as compared with B. napus. Further, the miRNAs identified to in this study were also regulated by stresses, which adds additional layer of regulation of PYLs. The frequency of SAPs identified was higher in indica cultivars and were predominantly located in START domain that participate in ABA binding. The promoters of most of the OsPYLs have cis-regulatory elements involved in imparting abiotic stress responsive expression. In silico and q-RT-PCR expression analyses of PYL genes revealed multifaceted role of ABARs in shaping plant development as well as abiotic stress responses."

Horseradish peroxidase histochemical or lectin-immunofluorescence histochemical labelling of bladder afferents was seen in the L6-S1 spinal cord segments and in the T13-L2 and L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia. In the lumbosacral spinal cord, the most intense and extensive labelling of bladder afferents was seen when cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase was injected. Cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase-labelled fibres were found in Lissauer's tract, its lateral and medial collateral projections, and laminae I and IV-VI of the spinal gray matter. Labelled fibres were numerous in the lateral collateral projection and extended into the spinal parasympathetic nucleus. Labelling from both the lateral and medial projections extended into the dorsal grey commissural region. Wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase labelling produced a similar pattern but was not as dense and extensive as that of cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase. The isolectin B4 from Griffonia simplicifolia I-horseradish peroxidase-labelled fibres, on the other hand, were fewer and only observed in the lateral collateral projection and occasionally in lamina I. Cell profile counts showed that a larger number of dorsal root ganglion cells were labelled with cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase than with wheat germ agglutinin- or isolectin B4-horseradish peroxidase. In the L6-S1 dorsal root ganglia, the majority (81%) of the cholera toxin B subunit-, and almost all of the wheat germ agglutinin- and isolectin B4-immunoreactive cells were RT97-negative (an anti-neurofilament antibody that labels dorsal root ganglion neurons with myelinated fibres). Double labelling with other neuronal markers showed that 71%, 43% and 36% of the cholera toxin B subunit-immunoreactive cells were calcitonin gene-related peptide-, isolectin B4-binding- and substance P-positive, respectively. A few cholera toxin B subunit cells showed galanin-immunoreactivity, but none were somatostatin-, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, or neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive or contained fluoride-resistant acid phosphatase. The results show that cholera toxin B subunit-horseradish peroxidase is a more effective retrograde and transganglionic tracer for pelvic primary afferents from the urinary bladder than wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase and isolectin B4-horseradish peroxidase, but in contrast to somatic nerves, it is transported mainly by unmyelinated fibres in the visceral afferents."

Zinc solubilizing bacteria are potential alternatives for zinc supplementation and convert applied inorganic zinc to available forms. This study was conducted to screen zinc solubilizing rhizobacteria isolated from wheat and sugarcane, and to analyze their effect on wheat growth and development. Fourteen exo-polysaccharides producing bacterial isolates of wheat were identified and characterized biochemically as well as on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences. Along these, 10 identified sugarcane isolates were also screened for zinc solubilizing ability on five different insoluble zinc sources. Out of 24, five strains, i.e., EPS 1 ( Pseudomonas fragi) , EPS 6 ( Pantoea dispersa) , EPS 13 ( Pantoea agglomerans) , PBS 2 ( E. cloacae) and LHRW1 ( Rhizobium sp.) were selected (based on their zinc solubilizing and PGP activities) for pot scale plant experiments. ZnCO 3 was used as zinc source and wheat seedlings were inoculated with these five strains, individually, to assess their effect on plant growth and development. The effect on plants was analyzed based on growth parameters and quantifying zinc content of shoot, root and grains using atomic absorption spectroscopy. Plant experiment was performed in two sets. For first set of plant experiments (harvested after 1 month), maximum shoot and root dry weights and shoot lengths were noted for the plants inoculated with Rhizobium sp. (LHRW1) while E. cloacae (PBS 2) increased both shoot and root lengths. Highest zinc content was found in shoots of E. cloacae (PBS 2) and in roots of P. agglomerans (EPS 13) followed by zinc supplemented control. For second set of plant experiment, when plants were harvested after three months, Pantoea dispersa (EPS 6), P. agglomerans (EPS 13) and E. cloacae (PBS 2) significantly increased shoot dry weights. However, significant increase in root dry weights and maximum zinc content was recorded for Pseudomonas fragi (EPS 1) inoculated plants, isolated from wheat rhizosphere. While maximum zinc content for roots was quantified in the control plants indicating the plant's inability to transport zinc to grains, supporting accelerated bioavailability of zinc to plant grains with zinc solubilizing rhizobacteria."

"29698484","abstracttext","Leaf rust of wheat caused by Puccinia triticina has significant impact on wheat production worldwide. Effective and quick detection methodologies are required to mitigate yield loss and time constraints associated with monitoring and management of leaf rust of wheat. In the present study, detection of P. triticina has been simplified by developing a rapid, reliable, efficient and visual colorimetric method i.e., loop mediated isothermal amplification of DNA (LAMP). Based on in silico analysis of P. triticina genome, PTS68, a simple sequence repeat was found highly specific to leaf rust fungus. A marker (PtRA68) was developed and its specificity was validated through PCR technique which gave a unique and sharp band of 919 bp in P. triticina pathotypes only. A novel gene amplification method LAMP which enables visual detection of pathogen by naked eye was developed for leaf rust pathogen. A set of six primers was designed from specific region of P. triticina and conditions were optimised to complete the observation process in 60 minutes at 65o C. The assay developed in the study could detect presence of P. triticina on wheat at 24 hpi (pre-symptomatic stage) which was much earlier than PCR without requiring thermal cycler. Sensitivity of LAMP assay developed in the study was 100 fg which was more sensitive than conventional PCR (50 pg) and equivalent to qPCR (100 fg). The protocol developed in the study was utilized for detection of leaf rust infected samples collected from different wheat fields. LAMP based colorimetric detection assay showed sky blue color in positive reaction and violet color in negative reaction after addition of 120 μM hydroxyl napthol blue (HNB) solution to reaction mixture. Similarly, 0.6 mg Ethidium bromide/ml was added to LAMP products, placed on transilluminator to witness full brightness in positive reaction and no such brightness could be seen in negative reaction mixture. Further, LAMP products spread in a ladder like banding pattern in gel electrophoresis. Our assay is significantly faster than the conventional methods used in the identification of P. triticina. The assay developed in the study shall be very much useful in the development of diagnostic kit for monitoring disease, creation of prediction model and efficient management of disease."

The recombinant WGA2 from the cells containing the prepro-WGA2 gene expression plasmid was purified to homogeneity by a three-step ion-exchange chromatography scheme. As in wheat, the N-terminal signal peptide of recombinant WGA2 purified from yeast culture was processed to form an N-terminal 5-oxoprolyl (pyroglutamyl) residue. Likewise, we found that the C-terminal pro-region of recombinant WGA2 had also been processed in yeast. Using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry, we found the processed C-terminus to be heterogeneous in both recombinant WGA2 purified from yeast and in authentic WGA2. The major component of the recombinant WGA2 contained two additional amino acids at its C-terminus compared to that of authentic WGA2. In spite of this difference in the C-terminus, the recombinant WGA2 exhibited a sugar binding activity that was indistinguishable from that of authentic WGA2."

Antisera against neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, and calcitonin gene-related peptide were utilized. Both the tracing method and calcitonin gene-related peptide immunohistochemistry after vagotomy showed that the paraganglia receive sensory innervation from the vagal ganglia. No labeling was detected in the paraganglia after injection of wheat-germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase in the superior cervical ganglion. Excision of this ganglion did not lead to a decrease in the neuropeptide-Y innervation in the paraganglia, but most of this innervation in the surrounding blood vessels disappeared. The observations show that the superior cervical ganglion does not contribute to the innervation in the paraganglia and that the neuropeptide-Y innervation of the blood vessels originates from the superior cervical ganglion whereas that of the paraganglia has another origin, most likely local ganglionic cells. The results also suggest that the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide innervation in the paraganglia arises from local ganglionic cells. The two approaches complemented each other in mapping the afferent and efferent nerve supply of the paraganglia."
"8144592","articletitle","The HBP-1 family of wheat basic/leucine zipper proteins interacts with overlapping cis-acting hexamer motifs of plant histone genes."
"8144592","abstracttext","The type I element (CCACGTCANCGATCCGCG) is a cis-acting element that is essential for the transcriptional regulation of the wheat histone H3 (TH012) gene. The sequence CCACGTCA in the type I element resembles various plant regulatory elements that share an ACGT core sequence, which can be recognized by different basic/leucine zipper (bZIP) proteins. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of wheat cDNA clones encoding three novel bZIP proteins, designated HBP (histone promoter-binding protein)-1a(1), HBP-1a(c14), and HBP-1b(c1). These proteins specifically bind to the ACGT core sequence and, together with previously identified HBP-1a(17) and HBP-1b(c38), constitute a protein family, named the HBP-1 family. Based on their structural characteristics and DNA binding specificities, members of the HBP-1 family can be grouped into HBP-1a and HBP-1b subfamilies. The HBP-1a isoforms are characterized by their N-terminal proline-rich domain and a C-terminal bZIP domain, which binds to the CCACGT motif. In contrast, the HBP-1b isoforms have a bZIP domain at the N terminus, which binds to the ACGTCA motif, and a glutamine-rich domain at the C terminus. All members of both subfamilies interact with the CCACGTCA sequence, but their DNA binding specificities and affinities differ. Since HBP-1a isoforms form heterodimers in all pairwise combinations, heterodimer formation among these bZIP proteins may generate an expanded repertoire of regulatory potential for gene expression in plants."

The bZIP-type wheat nuclear protein HBP-1a(17) is a putative transcriptional activator specifically binding to the Hex (ccACGTCA) and G-box (CCACGTGG) motifs, which are often found in the cis-acting elements critical for various responses in plants."
"9078369","abstracttext_results","In order to investigate the mechanisms for gene expression mediated via the Hex and G-box motifs, we attempted to isolate proteins interacting with HBP-1a(17) based on protein-protein interactions. A cDNA expression library from wheat seedlings was screened with 32P-labelled HBP-1a(17), and a bZIP-type protein, termed HALF-1 (HBP-1-associated leucine-zipper factor-1), was isolated. GST-pulldown assay, yeast two-hybrid system and EMSA showed that HALF-1 and HBP-1a(17) interact with each other through their leucine-zipper regions. Dissection experiments showed that HALF-1 has at least one potential trans-activation domain which includes a nine amino acid motif conserved between several plant bZIP-type proteins. This motif, named GCB (GBF-conserved box; consensus, NLNIGMDXW), activated the expression of a reporter gene, when fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. The corresponding region of Arabidopsis GBF1 also stimulated transcription. However, the trans-activation domain of HALF-1 did not function in yeast."

"10353218","abstracttext","Sequencing and computer analysis revealed that a wcr (wheat cold-regulated) cDNA, wcr12, contained a 525 bp open reading frame encoding a polypeptide of 174 amino acids. The deduced WCR12 protein had a high sequence similarity with Early light-inducible proteins (ELIPs) which are known as nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins induced by light stress. The accumulation of wcr12 transcripts was induced by low temperature below 8 degrees C and was also increased under a high light flux of 1,000 microEm-2 s-1, which are typical expression patterns of the genes for ELIPs in other plants. The dramatic increase in the level of wcr12 transcripts was detected at 4 degrees C even under a low light condition (50 microEm-2 s-1) and the level of transcripts became 20-fold higher than the control at 20 degrees C under a moderate light condition (250 microEm-2 s-1). Surprisingly, the accumulation of wcr12 mRNAs was also induced by cold treatment alone at 4 degrees C in the darkness. The level of wcr12 transcripts accumulated in the darkness at 4 degrees C reached the same level as that under a high light flux at 20 degrees C. These results indicate that light is not essential for the accumulation of wcr12 transcripts at a low temperature. To determine the chromosomal location of wcr12 gene, we performed Southern analysis using the nullitetrasomic lines. The data showed that the wcr12 gene or related homologues are located on the chromosomes of homoeologous group-5 in wheat."

"9482827","abstracttext","Progress in agricultural and environmental technologies is hampered by a slower rate of gene discovery in plants than animals. The vast pool of genes in plants, however, will be an important resource for insertion of genes, via biotechnological procedures, into an array of plants, generating unique germ plasms not achievable by conventional breeding. It just became clear that genomes of grasses have evolved in a manner analogous to Lego blocks. Large chromosome segments have been reshuffled and stuffer pieces added between genes. Although some genomes have become very large, the genome with the fewest stuffer pieces, the rice genome, is the Rosetta Stone of all the bigger grass genomes. This means that sequencing the rice genome as anchor genome of the grasses will provide instantaneous access to the same genes in the same relative physical position in other grasses (e.g., corn and wheat), without the need to sequence each of these genomes independently. (i) The sequencing of the entire genome of rice as anchor genome for the grasses will accelerate plant gene discovery in many important crops (e.g., corn, wheat, and rice) by several orders of magnitudes and reduce research and development costs for government and industry at a faster pace. (ii) Costs for sequencing entire genomes have come down significantly. Because of its size, rice is only 12% of the human or the corn genome, and technology improvements by the human genome project are completely transferable, translating in another 50% reduction of the costs. (iii) The physical mapping of the rice genome by a group of Japanese researchers provides a jump start for sequencing the genome and forming an international consortium. Otherwise, other countries would do it alone and own proprietary positions."
"10606249","articletitle","Short-chain fatty acid metabolism, apoptosis, and Apc-initiated tumorigenesis in the mouse gastrointestinal mucosa."
"10606249","abstracttext","Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are physiological regulators of growth and differentiation in the gastrointestinal tract, and we have previously shown that apoptosis induced in colonic cell lines by these compounds is dependent on their metabolism by B-oxidation in the mitochondria (B. G. Heerdt et al., J. Biol. Chem., 266: 19120-19126, 1991; Cancer Res., 54: 3288-3293, 1994). Because tumors initiated by an inherited Apc mutation have been reported to be linked to decreases in apoptosis in the flat mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, the aims were to determine whether elimination of efficient metabolism of SCFAs affected apoptosis in the gastrointestinal mucosa of the mouse, and whether this altered tumorigenesis initiated by an inherited Apc mutation. We, therefore, generated mice that have a chain-terminating mutation in the Apc gene and that were either wild-type for SCFA metabolism, or deficient, due to homozygous deletion of the gene (Scad) that encodes the enzyme short-chain acyl dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the first step in SCFA B-oxidation. Scad+/+ mice maintained on a wheat bran-fiber-supplemented diet gained significantly more weight than mice maintained on AIN76A, but this was eliminated by the Scad mutation, demonstrating that uptake and metabolism of SCFAs in the gastrointestinal tract can be a significant energy source. As predicted, on either AIN76A or wheat bran diet, the Scad mutation almost completely eliminated apoptosis in the flat mucosa of the proximal colon and reduced apoptosis by 50% in the distal colon compared with littermates that were wild-type for Scad. The mutation also reduced apoptosis by approximately 50% in the duodenum in AIN76A-fed mice. These reductions in apoptosis had no effect on incidence, frequency, or site specificity of tumors initiated by the Apc mutation. Therefore, the metabolism of SCFAs by the gastrointestinal mucosa plays a role in modulating apoptosis, but a general decrease in apoptosis in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract is not linked to gastrointestinal tumorigenesis initiated by an inherited Apc mutation."

"11716459","abstracttext","To explore the function of small subunits of Rubisco, three hybrid enzymes were synthesized in Escherichia coli by construction of a transcriptionally coupled expression system in which the synthetic small subunit gene of rice, tobacco, and wheat, respectively, was cloned downstream from the large subunit gene of Synechococcus sp. PCC6301. These coexpression products were detected by utilizing SDS-PAGE and confirmed by immunoblotting. The amount of carboxylase activity from the intact cells revealed that each higher plant small subunit was able to assemble with the Synechococcus large subunit octamer core to form an active heterologous enzyme in E. coli. However, in these heterologous enzymes, the interaction between large subunits and small subunits was very weak, the small subunit readily dissociated from the large subunit octamer core. A detailed kinetic assay was carried out with the partially purified hybrid enzymes. Compared to Synechococcus Rubisco, the activity of rice, tobacco, and wheat hybrid Rubisco decreased to 37, 61, and 37% of the original activity, respectively. These hybrid enzymes showed a greater affinity for CO2 and RuBP than Synechococcus Rubisco. The specificity factor of the three hybrid Rubiscos was 98, 84, and 76%, respectively, of the original. These results indicate for the first time that the small subunit contributes to the stability, catalytic efficiency, and CO2/O2 specificity of Rubisco together, which suggests that small subunits may be fruitful targets for engineering an improved Rubisco. Meanwhile, we found that sorbitol in the culture of induced cells promoted the production of active assembled enzyme and shortened the time to reach maximal expression."

"15657742","abstracttext","Puroindoline a (Pin-a) and puroindoline b (Pin-b), two basic isoforms encoded by the Pina-D1 and Pinb-D1 loci respectively, involved in controlling grain texture in wheat, were isolated from starch granules of soft wheat cultivars using three different extraction procedures, and fractionated by acidic polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (A-PAGE). Tris buffer containing 1% Triton X-114 extracted Pin-a and small amounts of Pin-b, whereas 1% SDS preferably extracted Pin-b. Large amounts of both puroindolines were isolated by a solution containing 50% propan-2-ol and 50 mM NaCl. This solution extracted reduced amounts of Pin-b and no traces of Pin-a from starch granules of 20 hard common wheats containing the null allele Pina-D1b. The absence of Pin-a was confirmed by immunostaining with an anti-Pin-a antiserum. With the exception of two cultivars, null Pin-a cultivars gave no PCR fragment with three primer pairs specific to either the coding region or the promoter region of Pina-D1a, suggesting that major changes had occurred at the Pina-D1 locus in these genotypes. Cultivars Fortuna and Glenman were unique in giving size-specific PCR fragments with all primer pairs for the allele Pina-D1a and showed a cytosine deletion at position 267 in the coding region of the Pin-a gene, which resulted in a TGA stop codon at position 361. However, there was no evidence of a mutated protein in the A-PAGE or SDS-PAGE patterns of Fortuna and Glenman. The novel gene, provisionally named Pina-D1c, is the first null allele due to a point mutation that has been identified at the Pina-D1 locus."
"15564534","articletitle","The maize O2 and PBF proteins act additively to promote transcription from storage protein gene promoters in rice endosperm cells."
"15564534","abstracttext","A transient expression assay system was employed to investigate the possible use of the maize Opaque 2 (O2) and prolamin box binding factor (PBF) proteins as transcriptional activators of rice and wheat storage protein gene promoters. When assayed in developing rice endosperm cells, either O2 or PBF alone could increase transcription from the promoter of the rice glutelin gene, Gt1. However, mutant forms of O2 and PBF that are defective in DNA binding could not. Co-transfection with both transcriptional activators resulted in an additive increase in transactivation of the Gt1 promoter. Co-bombardment of a Gt1::GUS construct with plasmids expressing the DNA binding domains of O2 and PBF in antisense orientation resulted in a decrease of GUS expression below background levels. Similar stimulatory and additive effects of O2 and PBF could be observed on the promoters from other storage protein genes including rice globulin (Glb), prolamins (RP6 and PG5a) and a wheat glutenin (Bx7). However, responsiveness of the promoters from non-storage protein genes like rice actin and CaMV 35S to O2 and PBF was insignificant. Our results indicate that the maize O2 and PBF proteins can act singly or additively as effective stimulators of heterologous storage protein promoters in developing rice endosperm cells. These data support the use of well-characterized transcription factors from maize as an effective means of increasing the expression level of recombinant proteins in developing rice seeds."

"15909137","abstracttext","To study the relation between the number of hyphal tips and protein secretion during growth on a solid substrate, we have constructed two mutant strains of Aspergillus oryzae with increased hyphal branching. We have analysed hydrolytic enzyme activities during growth on wheat kernels (WK) of A. oryzae strains carrying the disrupted allele of the pclA gene encoding a secretion pathway specific (KEX2-like) endo-protease and the disrupted allele of the pg/pi-tp gene encoding a phosphatidylglycerol/phosphatidylinositol transfer protein. The biomass levels produced by the pclA and pg/pi-tp disrupted strains on wheat-based solid media were similar as found for the wild-type strain. However, the pclA disrupted strain showed much more compact colony morphology than the other two strains. Sporulation of the pclA and pg/pi-tp disrupted strains occurred, respectively, 2 days and 1 day later, compared to the wild type during fermentation on ground WK. During surface growth, microscopic analysis revealed that the hyphal growth unit length (L (hgu)) of the pclA and pg/pi-tp disrupted strains was, on average, 50 and 74% of that of the wild-type strain. This implies that in both mutant strains, a higher branching frequency occurs than in the wild-type strain. Compared to the wild-type strain, the pclA and pg/pi-tp disrupted strains produced at least 50% more amylase, at least 100% more glucoamylase and at least 90% more protease activity levels after growth on WK. These results support the hypothesis that branching mutants with an increased branching frequency can improve the solid state fermentation process."

"14727031","abstracttext","PCR was used to amplify low-molecular-weight (LMW) glutenin genes from the Glu-A3 loci of hexaploid wheat cultivars containing different Glu-A3 alleles. The complete coding sequence of one LMW glutenin gene was obtained for each of the seven alleles Glu-A3a to Glu-A3g. Chromosome assignment of PCR products using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines confirmed the amplified products were from chromosome 1A. All sequences were classified as LMW-i-type genes based on the presence of an N-terminal isoleucine residue and eight cysteine residues located within the C-terminal domain of the predicted, mature amino acid sequence. All genes contained a single uninterrupted open reading frame, including the sequence from the Glu-A3e allele, for which no protein product has been identified. Comparison of LMW glutenin gene sequences obtained from different alleles showed a wide range of sequence identity between the genes, with between 1 and 37 single nucleotide polymorphisms and between one and five insertion/deletion events between genes from different alleles. Allele-specific PCR markers were designed based on the DNA polymorphisms identified between the LMW glutenin genes, and these markers were validated against a panel of cultivars containing different Glu-A3 alleles. This collection of markers represents a valuable resource for use in marker-assisted breeding to select for specific alleles of this important quality-determining locus in bread wheat."

"15276451","abstracttext","Since the complete genomic DNA sequencing of various species, attention has turned to the structural properties, and functional characteristics of proteins. Current cell-free protein expression systems from eukaryotes are capable of synthesizing proteins with high speed and accuracy; however, the yields are low due to their instability over time. This report reviews the high-throughput, genome-scale biochemical annotation method based on the cell-free system prepared from wheat embryos. We first briefly reviewed our highly efficient and robust wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system, and then showed an application of the system for materialization and characterization of genetic information taking a cDNA library of protein kinase from Arabidopsis thaliana as an example. The procedure consists of: (1) fusion of the gene-of-interest to a purification-tag, amplified by the split-primer PCR method; (2) transcription and purification of mRNA; (3) cell-free protein synthesis in the bilayer system using 96-well titer plate; (4) affinity purification and activity measurement. We took 439 cDNAs encoding kinases among 1064 genes annotated so far, and they were translated in parallel into protein. Subsequent assay revealed 207 products having autophosphorylation activity. Furthermore, seven proteins out of 26 calcium-dependent protein kinase genes tested did phosphorylate a synthetic peptide substrate in the presence of calcium ion, demonstrating that the translation products, retained their substrate specificity. The information on biochemical function of gene products accumulated should revolutionize our understanding of biology and fundamentally alter the practice of medicine and influence other industries as well."

"16456656","abstracttext","The wheat Tsn1 gene confers sensitivity to the host-selective toxin Ptr ToxA produced by the tan spot fungus (Pyrenophora tritici-repentis). The long-term goal of this research is to isolate Tsn1 using a positional cloning approach. Here, we evaluated 54 ESTs (expressed sequence tags) physically mapped to deletion bin 5BL 0.75-0.76, which is a gene-rich region containing Tsn1. Twenty-three EST loci were mapped as either PCR-based single-stranded conformational polymorphism or RFLP markers in a low-resolution wheat population. The genetic map corresponding to the 5BL 0.75-0.76 deletion bin spans 18.5 cM and contains 37 markers for a density of 2 markers/cM. The EST-based genetic map will be useful for tagging other genes, establishing colinearity with rice, and anchoring sequence ready BAC contigs of the 5BL 0.75-0.76 deletion bin. High-resolution mapping showed that EST-derived markers together with previously developed AFLP-derived markers delineated Tsn1 to a 0.8 cM interval. Flanking markers were used to screen the Langdon durum BAC library and contigs of 205 and 228 kb flanking Tsn1 were assembled, sequenced, and anchored to the genetic map. Recombination frequency averaged 760 kb/cM across the 228 kb contig, but no recombination was observed across the 205 kb contig resulting in an expected recombination frequency of more than 10 Mb/cM. Therefore, chromosome walking within the Tsn1 region may be difficult. However, the sequenced BACs allowed the identification of one microsatellite in each contig for which markers were developed and shown to be highly suitable for marker-assisted selection of Tsn1."

"16831847","abstracttext","Previous studies with 95 bread wheat doubled haploid lines (DHLs) from the cross Chinese Spring (CS)xSQ1 trialled over 24 yearxtreatmentxlocations identified major yield quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in homoeologous locations on 7AL and 7BL, expressed mainly under stressed and non-stressed conditions, respectively. SQ1 and CS contributed alleles increasing yield on 7AL and 7BL, respectively. The yield component most strongly associated with these QTLs was grains per ear. Additional results which focus on the 7AL yield QTL are presented here. Trials monitoring agronomic, morphological, physiological, and anatomical traits revealed that the 7AL yield QTL was not associated with differences in flowering time or plant height, but with significant differences in biomass at maturity and anthesis, biomass per tiller, and biomass during tillering. In some trials, flag leaf chlorophyll content and leaf width at tillering were also associated with the QTL. Thus, it is likely that the yield gene(s) on 7AL affects plant productivity. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) for the 7AL yield QTL with CS or SQ1 alleles in an SQ1 background showed the SQ1 allele to be associated with >20% higher yield per ear, significantly higher flag leaf chlorophyll content, and wider flag leaves. Epidermal cell width and distance between leaf vascular bundles did not differ significantly between NILs, so the yield-associated gene may influence the number of cell files across the leaf through effects on cell division. Interestingly, comparative mapping with rice identified AINTEGUMENTA and G-protein subunit genes affecting lateral cell division at locations homologous to the wheat 7AL yield QTL."

"18944173","abstracttext","ABSTRACT The Lr34/Yr18 resistance gene provides durable, adult-plant, slow rusting resistance to leaf rust, yellow rust, and several other diseases of wheat. Flag leaves may exhibit spontaneous leaf tip necrosis and tips are more resistant than leaf bases. Despite the importance of this gene, the mechanism of resistance is unknown. Patterns of expression for 55,052 transcripts were examined by microarray analysis in mock-inoculated flag leaves of two pairs of wheat near isogenic lines for Lr34/Yr18 (Jupateco 73S/Jupateco 73R and Thatcher/Thatcher-Lr34). The Thatcher isolines were also examined for patterns of expression after inoculation with leaf rust. Mock-inoculated leaf tips of resistant plants showed up-regulation of 57 transcripts generally associated with ABA inducibility, osmotic stress, cold stress, and/or seed maturation. Several transcripts may be useful as expression markers for Lr34/Yr18. Five transcripts were also up-regulated in resistant leaf bases. The possible role of these transcripts in resistance is discussed. In mock-inoculated plants, pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins were not up-regulated in resistant flag leaves compared with that in susceptible flag leaves. In inoculated plants, the same set of PR proteins was up-regulated in both resistant and susceptible flag leaves. However, expression was often higher in resistant plants, suggesting a possible role for Lr34/Yr18 in priming of defense responses."

"18944587","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Isolates of Tilletia controversa and T. bromi were sampled from wheat and two Bromus species hosts, respectively, in the Pacific Northwest, and genetic variation within and among populations was determined. Fifty-one random amplified polymorphic DNA markers from eleven primers were treated as phenotypic 1 and 0 character state data to estimate similarities and analyze molecular variance (AMOVA) among populations and as putative genetic loci to carry out analyses of gene diversity. Phenotypic analysis of T. controversa and T. bromi isolates revealed two distinct clusters that were 37% similar. The T. bromi cluster was subdivided further into two groups, corresponding to host, with 40% similarity. Cluster analysis based on allele frequencies produced similar results and also supported two T. bromi groups based on host. No evidence of natural hybridization and introgression was detected between the T. controversa and T. bromi populations. Both AMOVA and gene diversity analyses detected moderate levels of differentiation among T. controversa populations, whereas T. bromi populations were highly differentiated. The level of genetic differentiation observed between the T. bromi populations on different Bromus species hosts supports the hypothesis that a high degree of host specificity exists in the wild grass-infecting smuts. We speculate that the higher level of genetic differentiation among the T. bromi populations compared with the T. controversa populations on wheat may be due to selection by a more genetically diverse host population."

Shafir) and isolate ISR8036 (which is virulent on both cultivars) were genetically cotrans-formed using the selectable marker gene hph, which confers resistance to hygromycin B (hygB), and the reporter gene uidA, encoding beta-glucuronidase (GUS). Most of the genetically transformed isolates (98.8%) produced similar pycnidial coverage on seedlings of 'Seri 82' and 'Shafir' as the two wild-type isolates. Southern analysis of 25 randomly selected hygB(R)GUS(+) transformants probed with the uidA sequence revealed multiple insertion sites. GUS activity was determined fluorimetrically by measuring the conversion of 4-methylumbelliferyl beta-D-glucuronide (MUG) to 4-methylumbelliferone (MU). The high GUS-expressing transformants 398D97 and 8036E27 were used to elucidate fungal development within inoculated leaf tissue by using GUS activity to estimate the fungal proteins content in planta. Increase in fungal biomass was recorded in 'Shafir' inoculated with the GUS-expressing transformants 398D97 and 8036E27 following a 12-day latent period. A 15-day latent period was recorded in 'Seri 82' inoculated with 8036E27, whereas an 18-day latent period was recorded on 'Seri 82' inoculated with 398D97 and the two mixtures 398D97 + ISR8036 and ISR398 + 8036E27. The rate of fungal development and the estimated level of fungal proteins at the pycnidia maturation stage was high in leaves of 'Shafir' and moderate to low on 'Seri 82', even in cases in which no significant differences were recorded in pycnidial coverage. An endogenous capacity to hydrolyze beta-1,4-D-glucuronidase was recorded in leaves inoculated with wild-type isolates. The latent periods in MU production of the uidA-expressing transformants mimicked those recorded for the wild-type isolates. However, at all stages, the levels of MU produced in wheat inoculated with wild-type isolates were markedly lower than those produced by GUS-expressing transformants. The mode of interaction (compatible or incompatible) determined the onset of the induction, rate, and level of enzyme production."

"18943009","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Alsen is a recently released spring wheat cultivar that has been widely grown in the United States because it has resistance to Fusarium head blight and leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina. Norm is a high yielding wheat cultivar that has been very resistant to leaf rust since it was released. Alsen and Norm were genetically examined to determine the number and identity of the leaf rust resistance genes present in both wheats. The two cultivars were crossed with leaf rust susceptible cv. Thatcher and F(1) plants were backcrossed to Thatcher. Eighty one and seventy three BCF(1) of Thatcher times; Alsen and Thatcher x Norm respectively, were selfed to obtain BCF(2) families. The BCF(2) families were tested as seedlings with different isolates of P. triticina that differed for virulence to specific leaf rust resistance genes. The BCF(2) families that lacked seedling resistance were also tested as adult plants in greenhouse tests and in a field rust nursery plot. Segregation of BCF(2) families indicated that Alsen had seedling genes Lr2a, Lr10, and Lr23 and adult plant genes Lr13 and Lr34. Norm was determined to have seedling genes Lr1, Lr10, Lr16, and Lr23 and adult plant genes Lr13 and Lr34. The characterization of Lr23 in the segregating populations was complicated by the presence of a suppressor gene in Thatcher and the high temperature sensitivity of resistance expression for this gene.

"18184065","abstracttext","Endophytic actinobacteria, isolated from healthy wheat tissue, which are capable of suppressing a number wheat fungal pathogens both in vitro and in planta, were investigated for the ability to activate key genes in the systemic acquired resistance (SAR) or the jasmonate/ethylene (JA/ET) pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana. Inoculation of A. thaliana (Col-0) with selected endophytic strains induced a low level of SAR and JA/ET gene expression, measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Upon pathogen challenge, endophyte-treated plants demonstrated a higher abundance of defense gene expression compared with the non-endophyte-treated controls. Resistance to the bacterial pathogen Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora required the JA/ET pathway. On the other hand, resistance to the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum involved primarily the SAR pathway. The endophytic actinobacteria appear to be able to ""prime"" both the SAR and JA/ET pathways, upregulating genes in either pathway depending on the infecting pathogen. Culture filtrates of the endophytic actinobacteria were investigated for the ability to also activate defense pathways. The culture filtrate of Micromonospora sp. strain EN43 grown in a minimal medium resulted in the induction of the SAR pathway; however, when grown in a complex medium, the JA/ET pathway was activated. Further analysis using Streptomyces sp. strain EN27 and defense-compromised mutants of A. thaliana indicated that resistance to E. carotovora subsp. carotovora occurred via an NPR1-independent pathway and required salicylic acid whereas the JA/ET signaling molecules were not essential. In contrast, resistance to F. oxysporum mediated by Streptomyces sp. strain EN27 occurred via an NPR1-dependent pathway but also required salicylic acid and was JA/ET independent."

"17955189","abstracttext","A glycosyl hydrolase family 54 (GH54) alpha-L-arabinofuranosidase gene (abfA) of Aureobasidium pullulans was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from genomic DNA and a 498-amino-acid open reading frame deduced from the DNA sequence. Modeling of the highly conserved A. pullulans AbfA protein sequence on the crystal structure of Aspergillus kawachii AkabfB showed that the catalytic amino acid arrangement and overall structure were highly similar including the N-terminal catalytic and C-terminal arabinose binding domains. The abfA gene was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and the heterologous enzyme was purified. The protein was monomeric, migrating at 49 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and eluting at 36 kDa upon gel filtration. AbfA showed maximal activity at 55 degrees C and between pH 3.5 and pH 4. The enzyme had a K (m) value for p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside of 3.7 mM and a V (max) of 34.8 micromol min(-1) mg protein(-1). Arabinose acted as a noncompetitive inhibitor with a K (i) of 38.4 mM. The enzyme released arabinose from maize fiber, oat spelt arabinoxylan, and wheat arabinoxylan, but not from larch wood arabinogalactan or alpha-1,5-debranched arabinan. AbfA displayed low activity against alpha-1,5-L-arabino-oligosaccharides. The enzyme acted synergistically with endo-beta-1,4-xylanase in the breakdown of wheat arabinoxylan. Binding of AbfA to xylan from several sources confirmed the presence of a functional carbohydrate-binding module."

"16666833","abstracttext","Full- and partial-length cDNAs encoding calmodulin mRNA have been cloned and sequenced from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Barley leaf mRNA, size-fractionated in sucrose density gradients, was used to synthesize double-stranded cDNA. The cDNA was cloned in lambdagt10 and screened with a synthetic, 14-nucleotide oligonucleotide probe, which was designed using the predicted coding sequences of the carboxy termini of spinach and wheat calmodulin proteins. The primary structure of barley calmodulin, predicted from DNA sequencing experiments, consists of 148 amino acids and differs from that of wheat calmodulin in only three positions. In two of the three positions, the amino acid changes are conservative, while the third change consists of an apparent deletion/insertion. The overall nucleotide sequence similarity between the amino acid coding regions of barley and vertebrate calmodulin mRNAs is approximately 77%. However, a region encoding 11 amino acids of the second Ca(2+)-binding domain is very highly conserved at the nucleotide level compared with the rest of the coding sequences (94% sequence identity between barley and chicken calmodulin mRNAs). Genomic Southern blots reveal that barley calmodulin is encoded by a single copy gene. This gene is expressed as a single size class of mRNA in all tissues of 7-day-old barley seedlings. In addition, these analyses indicate that a barley calmodulin cDNA coding region subclone is suitable as a probe for isolating calmodulin genes from other plants."

"18683907","abstracttext_results","Malayamycin exhibited in vitro antifungal activity against Stagonospora nodorum (Berk) Castell & Germano, the cause of stagonospora nodorum blotch of wheat. Growth in liquid minimum medium was merely delayed at 50 microg mL(-1), but sporulation was suppressed by more than 50% by 10 microg mL(-1) of malayamycin. When applied to wheat seedlings 36 h prior to infection, 10 microg mL(-1) of malayamycin reduced lesion size and significantly reduced pycnidiation to only 5% of the non-treated level. A transcription factor gene, Mrg1 (malayamycin response gene) whose expression was upregulated by application of malayamycin, was identified. Both Mrg1 knockout and overexpression strains were created. These strains were fully pathogenic, suggesting that the expression of Mrg1 did not affect pathogenicity. Interestingly, a strain that expressed Mrg1 50 times more than wild type showed a significant reduction in sporulation. However, all the tested knockout and overexpression strains retained sensitivity to malayamycin."

"18624646","abstracttext","In the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Azospirillum brasilense Sp245, nitric oxide produced by denitrification could be a signal involved in stimulation of root branching, and the dissimilatory nitrite reductase gene nirK is upregulated on wheat roots. Here, it was found that Sp245 did not contain one copy of nirK but two (named nirK1 and nirK2), localized on two different plasmids, including one plasmid prone to rearrangements. Their deduced protein sequences displayed 99.2% identity but their promoter regions and upstream genetic environment differed. Phylogenetic studies revealed that nirK1 and nirK2 clustered next to most beta-proteobacterial sequences rather than in the vicinity of other Azospirillum spp. and most alpha-proteobacterial sequences, regardless of whether DNA or deduced protein sequences were used. This points to past horizontal gene transfers. Analysis of the number of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions per site indicated that nirK has been subjected to neutral selection in bacteria. The use of transcriptional fusions with egfp, encoding an enhanced green fluorescent protein variant, revealed that both nirK1 and nirK2 promoter regions were upregulated in vitro under microaerobiosis or the presence of nitrite as well as on wheat roots. The analysis of nirK1 and nirK2 mutants revealed that the two genes were functional. Overall, results suggest that nirK has been acquired horizontally by A. brasilense Sp245 from a distant relative and underwent subsequent duplication; however, both paralogs remained functional and retained their upregulation by the plant partner."

"17630311","abstracttext","A real-time PCR SYBR green assay was developed to quantify populations of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG)-producing (phlD+) strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens in soil and the rhizosphere. Primers were designed and PCR conditions were optimized to specifically amplify the phlD gene from four different genotypes of phlD+ P. fluorescens. Using purified genomic DNA and genomic DNA extracted from washes of wheat roots spiked with bacteria, standard curves relating the threshold cycles (C(T)s) and copies of the phlD gene were generated for P. fluorescens strains belonging to genotypes A (Pf-5), B (Q2-87), D (Q8r1-96 and FTAD1R34), and I (FTAD1R36). The detection limits of the optimized real-time PCR assay were 60 to 600 fg (8 to 80 CFU) for genomic DNA isolated from pure cultures of P. fluorescens and 600 fg to 6.0 pg (80 to 800 CFU, corresponding to log 4 to 5 phlD+ strain CFU/rhizosphere) for bacterial DNA extracted from plant root washes. The real-time PCR assay was utilized to quantify phlD+ pseudomonads in the wheat rhizosphere. Regression analysis of population densities detected by real-time PCR and by a previously described phlD-specific PCR-based dilution endpoint assay indicated a significant linear relationship (P = 0.0016, r2 = 0.2). Validation of real-time PCR assays with environmental samples was performed with two different soils and demonstrated the detection of more than one genotype in Quincy take-all decline soil. The greatest advantage of the developed real-time PCR is culture independence, which allows determination of population densities and the genotype composition of 2,4-DAPG producers directly from the plant rhizospheres and soil."

The resistant and susceptible genotypes for crosses were identified by initial assessment of 45 wheat accessions for stripe rust resistance. Mixed inheritance model was applied to the data analysis of six basic populations P1, F1, P2, B1, B2, and F2 in the crosses. The results indicated that AUDPC in cross 1 was controlled by two major genes with additive-dominance epistatic effect plus polygenes with additive-dominance epistatic effects (model E). Whereas in case of cross 2, it was under the control of two major genes with additive-dominance epistatic effect plus additive-dominant polygenes (model E-1). Additive effect was predominant then all other types of genetic effects suggesting the delay in selection for resistance till maximum positive genes are accumulated in the individuals of subsequent generations. Occurrence of transgressive segregants for susceptibility and resistance indicated the presence of resistance as well as some negative genes for resistance in the parents. The major gene heritability was higher than the polygene heritability in B1, B2 and F2 for the crosses. The major gene as well as the polygene heritability was ranging from 48.99 to 87.12% and 2.26 and 36.80% for the two crosses respectively. The highest phenotypic variations in AUDPC (2504.10 to 5833.14) for segregating progenies (BC1, BC2 and F2) represent that the character was highly influenced by the environment."

"20059734","abstracttext","Pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins, induced in plants in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses, have been assumed to play a role in plant defense system. Proteins of the PR5 family, also named thaumatin-like proteins (TLPs), have been detected in numerous plant species. In this research, a novel PR5 gene, designated as TaPR5, was isolated and characterized from wheat leaves (cv. Suwon 11) infected by the stripe rust pathotype CY23 (incompatible interaction) using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). TaPR5 was predicted to encode a protein of 173 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 17.6 kDa and a theoretical pI of 4.64. The deduced amino acid sequence of TaPR5 showed a significant sequence similarity with PR5 and TLPs from barley and other plants and contained a putative signal peptide at the amino terminus. Southern blot analysis indicated that TaPR5 is coded by a single-copy gene. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that TaPR5 transcript is significantly induced and upregulated in the incompatible interaction while in the compatible interaction a relative low level of the transcript was detected. TaPR5 was also induced by phytohormones (SA, JA and ABA) and stress stimuli (wounding, cold temperature and high salinity). Using an assay of onion epidermal cells indicated accumulation of TaPR5 protein in the apoplast. The immunocytochemical method showed that the TaPR5 protein was detected on cell walls of wheat leaves in the incompatible interaction at markedly higher labeling density compared with the compatible interaction."

"19756474","abstracttext","Italian common wheat cultivars Libellula and Strampelli, grown for over three decades in Gansu province of China, have shown effective resistance to stripe rust. To elucidate the genetic basis of the resistance, F(3) populations were developed from crosses between the two cultivars and susceptible Chinese wheat cultivar Huixianhong. The F(3) lines were evaluated for disease severity in Beijing, Gansu and Sichuan from 2005 to 2008. Joint- and single-environment analyses by composite interval mapping identified five quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in Libellula for reduced stripe rust severity, designated QYr.caas-2DS, QYr.caas-4BL, QYr.caas-5BL.1, QYr.caas-5BL.2 and QYr.caas-7DS, and explained 8.1-12.4, 3.6-5.1, 3.4-8.6, 2.6 and 14.6-35.0%, respectively, of the phenotypic variance across four environments. Six interactions between different pairs of QTLs explained 3.2-7.1% of the phenotypic variance. The QTLs QYr.caas-4BL, QYr.caas-5BL.1 and QYr.caas-7DS were also detected in Strampelli, explaining 4.5, 2.9-5.5 and 17.1-39.1% of phenotypic variance, respectively, across five environments. Three interactions between different pairs of QTLs accounted for 6.1-35.0% of the phenotypic variance. The QTL QYr.caas-7DS flanked by markers csLV34 and Xgwm295 showed the largest effect for resistance to stripe rust. Sequence analyses confirmed that the lines with the QYr.caas-7DS allele for resistance carried the resistance allele of the Yr18/Lr34 gene. Our results indicated that the adult-plant resistance gene Yr18 and several minor genes confer effective durable resistance to stripe rust in Libellula and Strampelli."
"19683668","articletitle","Characterization of the promoter of phosphate transporter TaPHT1.2 differentially expressed in wheat varieties."
"19683668","abstracttext","TaPHT1.2 is a functional, root predominantly expressed and low phosphate (Pi) inducible high-affinity Pi transporter in wheat, which is more abundant in the roots of P-efficient wheat genotypes (e.g., Xiaoyan 54) than in P-inefficient genotypes (e.g., Jing 411) under both Pi-deficient and Pi-sufficient conditions. To characterize TaPHT1.2 further, we genetically mapped a TaPHT1.2 transporter, TaPHT1.2-D1, on the long arm of chromosome 4D using a recombinant inbred line population derived from Xiaoyan 54 and Jing 411, and isolated a1,302 bp fragment of the TaPHT1.2-D1 promoter (PrTaPHT1.2-D1) from Xiaoyan 54. TaPHT1.2-D1 shows collinearity with OsPHT1.2 that has previously been reported to mediate the translocation of Pi from roots to shoots. PrTaPHT1.2-D contains a number of Pi-starvation responsive elements, including P1BS, WRKY-binding W-box, and helix-loop-helix-binding elements. PrTaPHT1.2-D1 was then used to drive expression of beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in Arabidopsis through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Histochemical analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed that the reporter gene was specifically induced by Pi-starvation and predominantly expressed in the roots. As there is only one SNP between the TaPHT1.2-D1 promoters of Xiaoyan 54 and Jing 411, and this SNP does not exist within the Pi-starvation responsive elements, the differential expression of TaPHT1.2 in Xiaoyan 54 and Jing 411 may not be caused by this SNP."

"21551103","abstracttext","Induced mutagenesis can be an effective way to increase variability in self-pollinated crops for a wide variety of agronomically important traits. Crop resistance to a given herbicide can be of practical value to control weeds with efficient chemical use. In some crops (for example, wheat, maize, and canola), resistance to imidazolinone herbicides (IMIs) has been introduced through mutation breeding and is extensively used commercially. However, this production system imposes plant-back restrictions on rotational crops because of herbicide residuals in the soil. In the case of barley, a preferred rotational crop after wheat, a period of 9-18 mo is required. Thus, introduction of barley varieties showing resistance to IMIs will provide greater flexibility as a rotational crop. The objective of the research reported was to identify resistance in barley for IMIs through induced mutagenesis. To achieve this objective, a sodium azide-treated M(2)/M(3) population of barley cultivar Bob was screened for resistance against acetohydroxy acid synthase (AHAS)-inhibiting herbicides. The phenotypic screening allowed identification of a mutant line showing resistance against IMIs. Molecular analysis identified a single-point mutation leading to a serine 653 to asparagine amino acid substitution in the herbicide-binding site of the barley AHAS gene. The transcription pattern of the AHAS gene in the mutant (Ser653Asn) and WT has been analyzed, and greater than fourfold difference in transcript abundance was observed. Phenotypic characteristics of the mutant line are promising and provide the base for the release of IMI-resistant barley cultivar(s)."

"23449812","abstracttext","Eighty four halotolerant bacterial strains were isolated from the saline habitats and screened for growth at different NaCl concentrations. All grew well at 5% NaCl, but only 25% isolates showed growth at 20% NaCl concentration. Five strains SL3, SL32, SL35, J8W and PU62 growing well in 20% NaCl concentrations were further characterized for multiple plant growth promoting traits such as indole -3- acetic acid (IAA) production, HCN and siderophore production, ACC deaminase activity and P-solubilization. None were positive for HCN production and PCR amplification of acdS, the structural gene for ACC deaminase enzyme was found negative. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis of the five strains showed them to belong to two genera Bacillus and Hallobacillus. In vitro experiments showed that salt concentrations had significant inhibitory effects on development of seedlings but not on the growth of the bacterial strains. Inoculation of the 5 halotolerant bacterial strains to ameliorate salt stress (80 mM, 160 mM and 320 mM) in wheat seedlings produced an increase in root length of 71.7% in comparison with uninoculated positive controls. In particular, Hallobacillus sp. SL3 and Bacillus halodenitrificans PU62 showed more than 90% increase in root elongation and 17.4% increase in dry weight when compared to uninoculated wheat seedlings at 320 mM NaCl stress indicating a significant reduction of the deleterious effects of NaCl. These results indicate that halotolerant bacteria isolated from saline environments have potential to enhance plant growth under saline stress through direct or indirect mechanisms and would be most appropriate as bioinoculants under such conditions."

"23567863","abstracttext","The enhancement of winter hardiness is one of the most important tasks facing breeders of winter cereals. For this reason, the examination of those regulatory genes involved in the cold acclimation processes is of central importance. The aim of the present work was the functional analysis of two wheat CBF transcription factors, namely TaCBF14 and TaCBF15, shown by previous experiments to play a role in the development of frost tolerance. These genes were isolated from winter wheat and then transformed into spring barley, after which the effect of the transgenes on low temperature stress tolerance was examined. Two different types of frost tests were applied; plants were hardened at low temperature before freezing, or plants were subjected to frost without a hardening period. The analysis showed that TaCBF14 and TaCBF15 transgenes improve the frost tolerance to such an extent that the transgenic lines were able to survive freezing temperatures several degrees lower than that which proved lethal for the wild-type spring barley. After freezing, lower ion leakage was measured in transgenic leaves, showing that these plants were less damaged by the frost. Additionally, a higher Fv/Fm parameter was determined, indicating that photosystem II worked more efficiently in the transgenics. Gene expression studies showed that HvCOR14b, HvDHN5, and HvDHN8 genes were up-regulated by TaCBF14 and TaCBF15. Beyond that, transgenic lines exhibited moderate retarded development, slower growth, and minor late flowering compared with the wild type, with enhanced transcript level of the gibberellin catabolic HvGA2ox5 gene."

"22878956","abstracttext","The effects of contrasting water and nitrogen (N) supply on the observed inheritance mode of transpiration efficiency (TE) at the flag-leaf and whole-season levels were examined in winter wheat. Major components of the photosynthetic capacity of leaves and the season-integrated efficiency of water use in vegetative and grain mass formation were evaluated in parental lines of various origins and their diallel F(2)-hybrids grown in a factorial experiment under different moisture and N status of the soil. A broad genetic variation was mainly found for the season-long TE measures. The variation range in the leaf photosynthetic indices was usually narrow, but tended to slightly enhance under water and N shortage. Genotype-treatment interaction effects were significant for most characters. No consistency between the leaf- and season-long TE measures was observed. Preponderance of additivity-dependent variance was mainly identified for the season-integrated TE and leaf CO(2) assimilation rate. Soil treatments exhibited considerable influence on the phenotypic expression of gene action for the residual leaf measures. The contribution of non-additive gene effects and degree of dominance tended to increase in water- and N-limited plants, especially for the leaf transpiration rate and stomatal conductance. The results indicate that promise exists to improve the season-integrated TE. However, selection for TE components should be prolonged for later hybrid generations to eliminate the masking of non-additive causes. Such evaluation among families grown under sub-optimal water and nitrogen supply seems to be the most promising strategy in winter wheat."

"22693448","abstracttext","WOR1 is a gene for a conserved fungal regulatory protein controlling the dimorphic switch and pathogenicity determents in Candida albicans and its ortholog in the plant pathogen Fusarium oxysporum, called SGE1, is required for pathogenicity and expression of key plant effector proteins. F. graminearum, an important pathogen of cereals, is not known to employ switching and no effector proteins from F. graminearum have been found to date that are required for infection. In this study, the potential role of the WOR1-like gene in pathogenesis was tested in this toxigenic fungus. Deletion of the WOR1 ortholog (called FGP1) in F. graminearum results in greatly reduced pathogenicity and loss of trichothecene toxin accumulation in infected wheat plants and in vitro. The loss of toxin accumulation alone may be sufficient to explain the loss of pathogenicity to wheat. Under toxin-inducing conditions, expression of genes for trichothecene biosynthesis and many other genes are not detected or detected at lower levels in Δfgp1 strains. FGP1 is also involved in the developmental processes of conidium formation and sexual reproduction and modulates a morphological change that accompanies mycotoxin production in vitro. The Wor1-like proteins in Fusarium species have highly conserved N-terminal regions and remarkably divergent C-termini. Interchanging the N- and C- terminal portions of proteins from F. oxysporum and F. graminearum resulted in partial to complete loss of function. Wor1-like proteins are conserved but have evolved to regulate pathogenicity in a range of fungi, likely by adaptations to the C-terminal portion of the protein."
"22693618","articletitle","The AMT1 arginine methyltransferase gene is important for plant infection and normal hyphal growth in Fusarium graminearum."
"22693618","abstracttext","Arginine methylation of non-histone proteins by protein arginine methyltransferase (PRMT) has been shown to be important for various biological processes from yeast to human. Although PRMT genes are well conserved in fungi, none of them have been functionally characterized in plant pathogenic ascomycetes. In this study, we identified and characterized all of the four predicted PRMT genes in Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley. Whereas deletion of the other three PRMT genes had no obvious phenotypes, the Δamt1 mutant had pleiotropic defects. AMT1 is a predicted type I PRMT gene that is orthologous to HMT1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The Δamt1 mutant was slightly reduced in vegetative growth but normal in asexual and sexual reproduction. It had increased sensitivities to oxidative and membrane stresses. DON mycotoxin production and virulence on flowering wheat heads also were reduced in the Δamt1 mutant. The introduction of the wild-type AMT1 allele fully complemented the defects of the Δamt1 mutant and Amt1-GFP fusion proteins mainly localized to the nucleus. Hrp1 and Nab2 are two hnRNPs in yeast that are methylated by Hmt1 for nuclear export. In F. graminearum, AMT1 is required for the nuclear export of FgHrp1 but not FgNab2, indicating that yeast and F. graminearum differ in the methylation and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of hnRNP components. Because AMT2 also is a predicted type I PRMT with limited homology to yeast HMT1, we generated the Δamt1 Δamt2 double mutants. The Δamt1 single and Δamt1 Δamt2 double mutants had similar defects in all the phenotypes assayed, including reduced vegetative growth and virulence. Overall, data from this systematic analysis of PRMT genes suggest that AMT1, like its ortholog in yeast, is the predominant PRMT gene in F. graminearum and plays a role in hyphal growth, stress responses, and plant infection."

A total of 510 one-day-old male broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 3 dietary treatments, with 17 pens per treatment and 10 birds per pen. The dietary treatments consisted of a control diet and P- and Ca-deficient diets supplemented with either phytase (500 U/kg) or a combination of phytase and a multi-carbohydrase enzyme (Superzyme OM). The diets were pelleted at 78 degrees C and were fed ad libitum throughout the starter (9 d), grower (18 d), and finisher (15 d) phases of the experiment. Over the entire trial, growth performance of birds fed the phytase-supplemented diet did not differ from birds fed the control diet. The use of phytase in combination with a multicarbohydrase enzyme improved (P = 0.007) the feed conversion ratio from 1.90 to 1.84. Insulin liver receptor sensitivity increased by 9.3 and 12.3% (P = 0.004) for the phytase- and the carbohydrase-phytase-supplemented diets, respectively. There was no effect of phytase alone or carbohydrase and phytase supplementation on total plasma cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and blood glucose levels. However, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased (P = 0.007) for the phytase-carbohydrase treatment. Gene expression of insulin-like growth factor 1 tended to decrease by 32% (P = 0.083) after phytase-carbohydrase supplementation. The combination of carbohydrase and phytase enzymes may serve as an attractive means of facilitating nutrient availability for digestion and thus enhance the feeding value of wheat-soybean meal-based diets containing full-fat rapeseed. However, the extent to which the effects of enzyme addition on insulin receptors are associated with growth performance of broiler chicken requires further research."
"20857083","articletitle","Genetic mapping of stem rust resistance gene Sr13 in tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum L.)."
"20857083","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, can cause significant yield losses. To combat the disease, breeders have deployed resistance genes both individually and in combinations to increase resistance durability. A new race, TTKSK (Ug99), identified in Uganda in 1999 is virulent on most of the resistance genes currently deployed, and is rapidly spreading to other regions of the world. It is therefore important to identify, map, and deploy resistance genes that are still effective against TTKSK. One of these resistance genes, Sr13, was previously assigned to the long arm of chromosome 6A, but its precise map location was not known. In this study, the genome location of Sr13 was determined in four tetraploid wheat (T. turgidum ssp. durum) mapping populations involving the TTKSK resistant varieties Kronos, Kofa, Medora and Sceptre. Our results showed that resistance was linked to common molecular markers in all four populations, suggesting that these durum lines carry the same resistance gene. Based on its chromosome location and infection types against different races of stem rust, this gene is postulated to be Sr13. Sr13 was mapped within a 1.2-2.8 cM interval (depending on the mapping population) between EST markers CD926040 and BE471213, which corresponds to a 285-kb region in rice chromosome 2, and a 3.1-Mb region in Brachypodium chromosome 3. These maps will be the foundation for developing high-density maps, identifying diagnostic markers, and positional cloning of Sr13."

"20658259","abstracttext","To accurately quantify gene expression using quantitative PCR amplification, it is vital that one or more ideal internal control genes are used to normalize the samples to be compared. Ideally, the expression level of those internal control genes should vary as little as possible between tissues, developmental stages and environmental conditions. In this study, 32 candidate genes for internal control were obtained from the analysis of nine independent experiments which included 333 Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome arrays. Expression levels of the selected genes were then evaluated by quantitative real-time PCR with cDNA samples from different tissues, stages of development and environmental conditions. Finally, fifteen novel internal control genes were selected and their respective expression profiles were compared using NormFinder, geNorm, Pearson correlation coefficients and the twofold-change method. The novel internal control genes from this study were compared with thirteen traditional ones for their expression stability. It was observed that seven of the novel internal control genes were better than the traditional ones in expression stability under all the tested cDNA samples. Among the traditional internal control genes, the elongation factor 1-alpha exhibited strong expression stability, whereas the 18S rRNA, Alpha-tubulin, Actin and GAPDH genes had very poor expression stability in the range of wheat samples tested. Therefore, the use of the novel internal control genes for normalization should improve the accuracy and validity of gene expression analysis."

"21247658","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of pre-anthesis high-temperature acclimation on leaf physiology of winter wheat in response to post-anthesis heat stress. The results showed that both pre- and post-anthesis heat stresses significantly depressed flag leaf photosynthesis and enhanced cell membrane peroxidation, as exemplified by increased O₂⁻(·) production rate and reduction in activities of antioxiditave enzymes. However, under post-anthesis heat stress, plants with pre-anthesis high-temperature acclimation (HH) showed much higher photosynthetic rates than those without pre-anthesis high-temperature acclimation (CH). Leaves of HH plants exhibited a higher Chl a/b ratio and lower chlorophyll/carotenoid ratio and superoxide anion radical release rate compared with those of the CH plants. In addition, antioxidant enzyme activities in HH plants were significantly higher than in CH. Coincidently, expressions of photosythesis-responsive gene encoding Rubisco activase B (RcaB) and antioxidant enzyme-related genes encoding mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), chloroplastic Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD), catalase (CAT) and cytosolic glutathione reductase (GR) were all up-regulated under HH, whereas a gene encoding a major chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (Cab) was up-regulated by post-anthesis heat stress at 10 DAA, but was down-regulated at 13 DAA. The changes in the expression levels of the HH plants were more pronounced than those for the CH. Collectively, the results indicated that pre-anthesis high-temperature acclimation could effectively alleviate the photosynthetic and oxidative damage caused by post-anthesis heat stress in wheat flag leaves, which was partially attributable to modifications in the expression of the photosythesis-responsive and antioxidant enzymes-related genes."

"21241786","abstracttext","Gene duplication contributes to the expansion of gene families and subsequent functional diversification. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are members of an important calcium sensor family involved in abiotic and biotic stress signaling in plants. We report here the molecular evolution and expression analysis of a pair of duplicated CDPK genes CPK7 and CPK12 that arose in the common ancestor of grass species. With higher nonsynonymous/synonymous ratios (dN/dS, or ω), CPK12 genes appear to diverge more rapidly than CPK7s, suggesting relaxed selection constraints on CPK12s. Sliding window analysis revealed increased dN and ω values at N-terminal regions and the calcium-binding EF hand loops. Likelihood analyses using various models in PAML 4.0 showed purifying selection on both CPK7 and CPK12 lineages. In addition to the divergence in cis-element combinations on their promoters, functional divergence of CPK7 and CPK12 genes was also observed in wheat where TaCPK7 was found to respond to drought (PEG), salt (NaCl), cold, and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) while TaCPK12 responded only to the treatment of ABA, a feature that may complement or expand TaCPK7-mediated stress signaling networks of wheat. The contrasting expression patterns of CPK7 and CPK12 genes under stress conditions were also observed in rice, suggesting conservative functional evolution of these genes. Since no positive selection was detected between the two lineages, the divergence of CPK7 and CPK12 genes should be ascribed to subfunctionalization, rather than neofunctionalization. Thus, our work demonstrates another case of evolutionary employment of duplicated genes via subfunctionalization for better adaptation."
"21695235","articletitle","Finished genome of the fungal wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola reveals dispensome structure, chromosome plasticity, and stealth pathogenesis."
"21695235","abstracttext","The plant-pathogenic fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola (asexual stage: Septoria tritici) causes septoria tritici blotch, a disease that greatly reduces the yield and quality of wheat. This disease is economically important in most wheat-growing areas worldwide and threatens global food production. Control of the disease has been hampered by a limited understanding of the genetic and biochemical bases of pathogenicity, including mechanisms of infection and of resistance in the host. Unlike most other plant pathogens, M. graminicola has a long latent period during which it evades host defenses. Although this type of stealth pathogenicity occurs commonly in Mycosphaerella and other Dothideomycetes, the largest class of plant-pathogenic fungi, its genetic basis is not known. To address this problem, the genome of M. graminicola was sequenced completely. The finished genome contains 21 chromosomes, eight of which could be lost with no visible effect on the fungus and thus are dispensable. This eight-chromosome dispensome is dynamic in field and progeny isolates, is different from the core genome in gene and repeat content, and appears to have originated by ancient horizontal transfer from an unknown donor. Synteny plots of the M. graminicola chromosomes versus those of the only other sequenced Dothideomycete, Stagonospora nodorum, revealed conservation of gene content but not order or orientation, suggesting a high rate of intra-chromosomal rearrangement in one or both species. This observed ""mesosynteny"" is very different from synteny seen between other organisms. A surprising feature of the M. graminicola genome compared to other sequenced plant pathogens was that it contained very few genes for enzymes that break down plant cell walls, which was more similar to endophytes than to pathogens. The stealth pathogenesis of M. graminicola probably involves degradation of proteins rather than carbohydrates to evade host defenses during the biotrophic stage of infection and may have evolved from endophytic ancestors."

"21726382","abstracttext","The main effects of antagonistic rhizobacteria on plant pathogenic fungi are antibiosis, fungistasis or an indirect constraint through the induction of a plant defence response. To explore different biocontrol mechanisms, an in vitro confrontation assay was conducted with the rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf29Arp as a biocontrol agent of the fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt) on wheat roots. In parallel with the assessment of disease extension, together with the bacterial and fungal root colonization rates, the transcript levels of candidate fungal pathogenicity and plant-induced genes were monitored during the 10-day infection process. The bacterial inoculation of wheat roots with the Pf29Arp strain reduced the development of Ggt-induced disease expressed as attack frequency and necrosis length. The growth rates of Ggt and Pf29Arp, monitored through quantitative polymerase chain reaction of DNA amounts with a part of the Ggt 18S rDNA gene and a specific Pf29Arp strain detection probe, respectively, increased throughout the interactions. Bacterial antagonism and colonization had no significant effect on root colonization by Ggt. The expression of fungal and plant genes was quantified in planta by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction during the interactions thanks to the design of specific primers and an innovative universal reference system. During the early stages of the tripartite interaction, several of the fungal genes assayed were down-regulated by Pf29Arp, including two laccases, a β-1,3-exoglucanase and a mitogen-activated protein kinase. The plant host glutathione-S-transferase gene was induced by Ggt alone and up-regulated by Pf29Arp bacteria in interaction with the pathogen. We conclude that Pf29Arp antagonism acts through the alteration of fungal pathogenesis and probably through the activation of host defences."

"22274764","abstracttext","Leaf rust and stripe rust are important diseases of wheat world-wide and deployment of cultivars with genetic resistance is an effective and environmentally sound control method. The use of minor, additive genes conferring adult plant resistance (APR) has been shown to provide resistance that is durable. The wheat cultivar 'Pastor' originated from the CIMMYT breeding program that focuses on minor gene-based APR to both diseases by selecting and advancing generations alternately under leaf rust and stripe rust pressures. As a consequence, Pastor has good resistance to both rusts and was used as the resistant parent to develop a mapping population by crossing with the susceptible 'Avocet'. All 148 F(5) recombinant inbred lines were evaluated under artificially inoculated epidemic environments for leaf rust (3 environments) and stripe rust (4 environments, 2 of which represent two evaluation dates in final year due to the late build-up of a new race virulent to Yr31) in Mexico. Map construction and QTL analysis were completed with 223 polymorphic markers on 84 randomly selected lines in the population. Pastor contributed Yr31, a moderately effective race-specific gene for stripe rust resistance, which was overcome during this study, and this was clearly shown in the statistical analysis. Linked or pleiotropic chromosomal regions contributing to resistance against both pathogens included Lr46/Yr29 on 1BL, the Yr31 region on 2BS, and additional minor genes on 5A, 6B and 7BL. Other minor genes for leaf rust resistance were located on 1B, 2A and 2D and for stripe rust on 1AL, 1B, 3A, 3B, 4D, 6A, 7AS and 7AL. The 1AL, 1BS and 7AL QTLs are in regions that were not identified previously as having QTLs for stripe rust resistance. The development of uniform and severe epidemics facilitated excellent phenotyping, and when combined with multi-environment analysis, resulted in the relatively large number of QTLs identified in this study."

"22351076","abstracttext","Silicon (Si) is known to be beneficial to plants, namely in alleviating biotic and abiotic stresses. The magnitude of such positive effects is associated with a plant's natural ability to absorb Si. Many grasses can accumulate as much as 10% on a dry weight basis while most dicots, including Arabidopsis, will accumulate less than 0.1%. In this report, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of TaLsi1, a wheat Si transporter gene. In addition, we developed a heterologous system for the study of Si uptake in plants by introducing TaLsi1 and OsLsi1, its ortholog in rice, into Arabidopsis, a species with a very low innate Si uptake capacity. When expressed constitutively under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter, both TaLsi1 and OsLsi1 were expressed in cells of roots and shoots. Such constitutive expression of TaLsi1 or OsLsi1 resulted in a fourfold to fivefold increase in Si accumulation in transformed plants compared to WT. However, this Si absorption caused deleterious symptoms. When the wheat transporter was expressed under the control of a root-specific promoter (a boron transporter gene (AtNIP5;1) promoter), a similar increase in Si absorption was noted but the plants did not exhibit symptoms and grew normally. These results demonstrate that TaLsi1 is indeed a functional Si transporter as its expression in Arabidopsis leads to increased Si uptake, but that this expression must be confined to root cells for healthy plant development. The availability of this heterologous expression system will facilitate further studies into the mechanisms and benefits of Si uptake."

"22417053","abstracttext","In this study, we explore the population genetics of the Russian wheat aphid (RWA) (Diuraphis noxia), one of the world's most invasive agricultural pests, in north-western China. We have analysed the data of 10 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial sequences from 27 populations sampled over 2 years in China. The results confirm that the RWAs are holocyclic in China with high genetic diversity indicating widespread sexual reproduction. Distinct differences in microsatellite genetic diversity and distribution revealed clear geographic isolation between RWA populations in northern and southern Xinjiang, China, with gene flow interrupted across extensive desert regions. Despite frequent grain transportation from north to south in this region, little evidence for RWA translocation as a result of human agricultural activities was found. Consequently, frequent gene flow among northern populations most likely resulted from natural dispersal, potentially facilitated by wind currents. We also found evidence for the long-term existence and expansion of RWAs in China, despite local opinion that it is an exotic species only present in China since 1975. Our estimated date of RWA expansion throughout China coincides with the debut of wheat domestication and cultivation practices in western Asia in the Holocene. We conclude that western China represents the limit of the far eastern native range of this species. This study is the most comprehensive molecular genetic investigation of the RWA in its native range undertaken to date and provides valuable insights into the history of the association of this aphid with domesticated cereals and wild grasses."

"23052019","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive wheat disease of global importance. Resistance breeding depends heavily on the Fhb1 gene. The CIMMYT line Shanghai-3/Catbird (SHA3/CBRD) is a promising source without this gene. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population from the cross of SHA3/CBRD with the German spring wheat cv. Naxos was evaluated for FHB resistance and related traits in field trials using spray and spawn inoculation in Norway and point inoculation in China. After spray and spawn inoculation, FHB severities were negatively correlated with both anther extrusion (AE) and plant height (PH). The QTL analysis showed that the Rht-B1b dwarfing allele co-localized with a QTL for low AE and increased susceptibility after spawn and spray inoculation. In general, SHA3/CBRD contributed most of the favorable alleles for resistance to severity after spray and spawn inoculation, while Naxos contributed more favorable alleles for reduction in FDK and DON content and resistance to severity after point inoculation. SHA3/CBRD contributed a major resistance QTL close to the centromere on 2DLc affecting FHB severity and DON after all inoculation methods. This QTL was also associated with AE and PH, with high AE and tall alleles contributed by SHA3/CBRD. Several QTL for AE and PH were detected, and low AE or reduced PH was always associated with increased susceptibility after spawn and spray inoculation. Most of the other minor FHB resistance QTL from SHA3/CBRD were associated with AE or PH, while the QTL from Naxos were mostly not. After point inoculation, no other QTL for FHB traits was associated with AE or PH, except the 2DLc QTL which was common across all inoculation methods. Marker-assisted selection based on the 2DLc QTL from SHA3/CBRD combined with phenotypic selection for AE is recommended for resistance breeding based on this valuable source of resistance."

"23376549","abstracttext","The global population structure and migration patterns of foliar wheat pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (PTR) were determined using 12 microsatellite loci. Analysis of 439 single-spore isolates of PTR from five continents (18 wheat-producing countries) showed high level of genetic diversity, and moderate to high population differentiation between continents. A high level of gene diversity (H(S)=0.31 to 0.56) was observed within each population. Allelic richness indicated the European and the North American population have a high effective population size. Bayesian analyses showed five clusters where the inferred clusters did not represent geographical populations. Corrected standardized fixation index (G(ST)(″)) estimates ranged from 0.042 to 0.265 between populations, indicating low to high genetic differentiation exists between populations. We found migration (gene flow) between old world (Europe) and new world (Americas) population; however, little migration was observed among other continents. The European population was the major source of immigrants for the North American, South American, Australian and the Asian populations. Significant (P<0.001) linkage disequilibrium (LD) was detected in the Australian and the South American populations. In contrast, non-significant (P<0.001) LD values were observed in the Asian, European and the North American populations. Overall, our findings demonstrate the population differentiation exits among the global populations and strict quarantine measures should be applied to prevent the accelerated global spread of this pathogen."

"24588850","abstracttext","In bread wheat, besides malate, the importance of citrate efflux for Al tolerance has also been reported. For better understanding the Al tolerance mechanism in bread wheat, here, we performed both a molecular characterization of the citrate transporter gene TaMATE1 and an investigation on the upstream variations in citrate and malate transporter genes. TaMATE1 belong to multidrug transporter protein family, which are located on the long arm of homoeologous group 4 chromosomes (TaMATE1-4A, TaMATE1-4B TaMATE1-4D). TaMATE1 homoeologues transcript expression study exhibited the preponderance of homoeologue TaMATE1-4B followed by TaMATE1-4D whereas homoeologue TaMATE1-4A seemed to be silenced. TaMATE1, particularly homoeologue TaMATE1-4B and TaALMT1 transcripts were much more expressed in the root apices than in shoots of Al tolerant genotype Barbela 7/72/92 under both control and Al stress conditions. In addition, in both tissues of Barbela 7/72/92, higher basal levels of these gene transcripts were observed than in Anahuac (Al sensitive). Noticeably, the presence of a transposon in the upstream of TaMATE1-4B in Barbela 7/72/92 seems to be responsible for its higher transcript expression where it may confer citrate efflux. Thus, promoter variations (transposon in TaMATE1-4B upstream and type VI promoter in TaALMT1) associated with higher basal transcript expression of TaMATE1-4B and TaALMT1 clearly show how different mechanisms for Al tolerance operate simultaneously in a single genotype. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Barbela 7/72/92 has favorable alleles for these organic acids transporter genes which could be utilized through genomic assisted selection to develop improved cultivars for acidic soils."

"24162360","abstracttext","Seventeen RNA-degrading enzymes of common wheat, with apparent molecular masses from 42.2 kDa to 16.3 kDa, were observed by the RNA-SDS-PAGE assay. To determine their chromosome locations, all chromosome arms of common wheat except 4BS were assayed in their null condition by using a set of ditelosomic or nullitetrasomic lines of the cultivar Chinese Spring. Our results showed that only one chromosome location each was identified for the 22.8-kDa and the 21.2-kDa enzymes, as well as for the 21.6 kDa enzyme, and they are on chromosome arms 2AS and 2DS, respectively. Loci controlling the 20.1 kDa activity were on chromosome arms 2AL, 4BS, 4DS and 6BS. The locus or loci coding for the gene(s) of the 42.2-kDa, 40.9-kDa and 39.2-kDa enzymes were probably ocated on chromosome arm 5AS, and their expression, in agreement with most other RNA-degrading enzyme activities were stimulated when chromosome arm 5AL was missing, indicating a inhibiting locus on 5AL. Our data suggested that the 31.9-kDa, 30.6-kDa and 29.6-kDa enzymes were possibly products of a common precursor which might be coded by a gene(s) on chromosome arm 6BS, and that the processing is co-regulated by loci on chromosome arms 2BS, 3DS, 6AL, 6BL and 7BS. The remaining of the enzyme activities were consistently found in all of the lines tested, and thus are presumably encoded by multiple loci. The only other possibility is that, their loci may be on chromosome arm 4BS which we have not assayed in its null condition."

"24177902","abstracttext","α-Amylases are the key enzymes involved in the hydrolysis of starch in plants. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect polymorphisms in the length of amplified sequences between the annealing sites of two primers derived from published α-amy1 gene sequences in barley. These two primers (Bsw1 and Bsw7), flanking the promoter region and the first exon, amplified two PCR fragments in barley. One of the amplified products, with the expected length of 820 bp, appeared together with another shorter PCR band of around 750 bp. This 750-bp fragment seems to be derived from an α-amylase gene not reported previously. Both of the PCR products could be amplified from the two-rowed barley varieties tested, including cv Himalaya from which the sequence information was obtained. Five of the six-rowed barley varieties also have the two PCR fragments whereas another two have only the long fragment. These two fragments seem to be unique to barley, neither of them could be amplified from other cereals; for example, wheat, rye or sorghum. These two α-amylase fragments were mapped to the long arm of 6H, the location of the α-amy1 genes, using wheat-barley addition lines. Amplification of genomic DNA from wild barley accessions with primers Bsw1 and Bsw7 indicated that both of the fragments could be present, or the long and short fragments could be present alone. The results also demonstrated that the genes specifying these two fragments could be independent from each other in barley. The conserved banding pattern of these two fragments in the two-rowed barley varieties implies that artificial selection from these genes may have played an important role in the evolution of cultivated barley from wild barley."

"24178027","abstracttext","The accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) by detached and partially dehydrated wheat leaves is known to be inherited in a quantitative manner. The location of genes having a major effect on drought-induced ABA accumulation in wheat was determined using a set of single chromosome substitution lines and populations derived from a cross between a high-ABA- and a low-ABA-producing genotype. Examination of a series of chromosome substitution lines of the high-ABA genotype 'Ciano 67' into the low-ABA recipient 'Chinese Spring' showed that chromosome 5A carries gene(s) that have a major influence on ABA accumulation in a drought test with detached and partially dehydrated leaves (DLT). A similar DLT was used to examine ABA accumulation in a population of F2 plants and doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from the cross between 'Chinese Spring' (low-ABA) and 'SQ1' (high-ABA) in which the F2 population (139 plants) and DH lines (96 lines) were also mapped partially with molecular markers. Analysis of variance of ABA accumulation between and within marker allele classes in the F2 confirmed the location of a gene(s) regulating ABA accumulation on the long arm of chromosome 5A. MAPMAKERQTL showed the most likely position for the ABA quantitative trait locus (QTL) to be between the loci Xpsr575 and Xpsr426, about 8 cM from Xpsr426. A similar trend for high ABA accumulation was found in DH lines having the 'SQ1' allele at marker loci in the same region of chromosome 5AL, but the QTL effect was not significant. The function of the QTL is discussed."

"24397376","abstracttext_background","Rust diseases are of major importance in wheat production worldwide. With the constant evolution of new rust strains and their adaptation to higher temperatures, consistent and durable disease resistance is a key challenge. Environmental conditions affect resistance gene performance, but the basis for this is poorly understood."
"24397376","abstracttext_results","Here we show that a change in day temperature affects wheat resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp tritici (Pst), the causal agent of yellow (or stripe) rust. Using adult plants of near-isogenic lines UC1041 +/- Yr36, there was no significant difference between Pst percentage uredia coverage in plants grown at day temperatures of 18°C or 25°C in adult UC1041 + Yr36 plants. However, when plants were transferred to the lower day temperature at the time of Pst inoculation, infection increased up to two fold. Interestingly, this response was independent of Yr36, which has previously been reported as a temperature-responsive resistance gene as Pst development in adult UC1041 -Yr36 plants was similarly affected by the plants experiencing a temperature reduction. In addition, UC1041 -Yr36 plants grown at the lower temperature then transferred to the higher temperature were effectively resistant and a temperature change in either direction was shown to affect Pst development up to 8 days prior to inoculation. Results for seedlings were similar, but more variable compared to adult plants. Enhanced resistance to Pst was observed in seedlings of UC1041 and the cultivar Shamrock when transferred to the higher temperature. Resistance was not affected in seedlings of cultivar Solstice by a temperature change in either direction."
"24397376","abstracttext_conclusions","Yr36 is effective at 18°C, refining the lower range of temperature at which resistance against Pst is conferred compared to previous studies. Results reveal previously uncharacterised defence temperature sensitivity in the UC1041 background which is caused by a change in temperature and independently of Yr36. This novel phenotype is present in some cultivars but absent in others, suggesting that Pst defence may be more stable in some cultivars than others when plants are exposed to varying temperatures."

"24497728","abstracttext","To investigate the lignifications process and its physiological significance under Karnal Bunt (KB), the changes in enzymes responsible for lignifications likes, phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL), were determined in resistant (HD-29) and susceptible genotype (WH-542) of wheat during different developmental stages. The PAL gene was cloned and sequenced. The expression of PAL gene was measured by means of semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The enzyme was expressed constitutively in both the susceptible and resistant genotype. However, the activity was higher in all the developmental stages of resistant genotype, indicating that this genotype has a significant higher basal level of these enzymes as compared to the susceptible line and could be used as marker(s) to define KB resistance. The activity of PAL was significantly higher in WSv stage (Z=16). Structural comparisons based on alignments of all the protein sequences using the clustal W program and searches for conserved motifs using the MEME program have revealed broad conservation of main motifs characteristic of the plant PAL. MSA and phylogenetic analyses of different plants PAL demonstrate that all PAL cluster divided in to two main cluster. The PAL also possesses a specific consensus sequences [GS]- [STG]-[LIVM]-[STG]-[SAC]-S-G-[DH]-L-x-[PN]-L-[SA]-x(2,3)-[SAGVTL]. The pathway might be associated with the enhancement of structural defense barrier due to lignifications of cell wall as evident from the enhanced synthesis of lignin in all the stages of resistant genotype. Our results clearly indicate the possible role of enzymes of Phenyl propanoid pathway metabolism provides genotype and stage dependant structural barrier resistance in wheat against KB."
"24302519","articletitle","Structure and variation in ribosomal RNA genes of pea : Characterization of a cloned rDNA repeat and chromosomal rDNA variants."
"24302519","abstracttext","A complete ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat unit has been cloned from the genome of Pisum sativum (garden pea) and used to construct a map containing a total of 58 cleavage sites for 23 different restriction enzymes. Regions encoding 18s and 25s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were identified by R-loop analysis. A 180 bp sequence element is repeated eight times in the intergenic 'nontranscribed spacer' (NTS) region, as defined by eight evenly spaced RsaI cleavage sites. Sequence heterogeneity among these elements (subrepeats) is indicated by the presence of an NcoI site within the five RsaI subrepeats distal to the 25s rRNA gene but not in the three subrepeats proximal to this gene, and also by the presence of an additional RsaI cleavage site in one subrepeat.The approximately 4000 copies of the rDNA repeat in the pea nuclear genome show considerable heterogeneity with respect to the length of the NTS region, and differences are also frequently observed between different genotypes. In both cases the length variation appears to be due primarily to differences in the number of subrepeat elements.Comparison of rDNA restriction maps for two pea genotypes separated for hundreds or perhaps thousands of generations reveals that they contain many rDNA identical repeat units. This data is consistent with the view that new rDNA variants are fixed only infrequently in the evolution of a species.Differences also exist between the rDNA repeats of a single genotype with respect to the degree of base modification at certain restriction sites. A large number of sites known to exist in the pea rDNA clone are not cleaved at all in genomic rDNA, or are cleaved in only some copies of the rDNA repeat. We believe these examples of incomplete cleavage results mostly from methylation, although it is difficult to rule out the possibility of sequence variation in all cases. Most putative modifications are best interpreted in terms of cytosine methylation in CG and CXG sequences, but at least one example is more consistent with adenine methylation.We also have constructed a more detailed restriction map of the wheat rDNA clone pTA71 and present a comparison of this map to our map of pea, pumpkin, and wheat in order to assess the amount of useful evolutionary information that can be obtained by comparison of such maps."

"24448321","abstracttext","Salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses affecting plant growth, development, and productivity. In this study, we functionally characterized a wheat vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene (TaNHX3). TaNHX3 is 78.9% identical with TaNHX2 in nucleic acid level, encoding a polypeptide of 522 amino acids (aa). TaNHX3 is targeted onto tonoplast after ER sorting and can complement the growth under salt stress in a yeast mutant with a defective vacuolar Na(+)/H(+) antiporter exchange. TaNHX3 transcripts were induced by applying salt stress in wheat cultivars. More TaNHX3 were detected in the salt-stress-resistant cultivar Ji 7369 compared with the salt-stress-sensitive cultivar Shimai 12 and Ji-Shi-3, an isogenic line derived from aforementioned cultivars with Shimai 12 genetic background. The ectopic TaNHX3 expression in tobacco significantly enhanced the plant tolerance to salt stress. Compared with control plants, the TaNHX3 overexpressing plants displayed no varied Na(+) contents and accumulated more Na(+) amount in plants. However, they exhibited higher fresh and dry weights, more accumulative nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, higher contents of chlorophyll, carotenoid, soluble protein, higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes including superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase, and lower malondialdehyde and H2O2 amount. Our results indicated that TaNHX3 plays an important role in regulating the cytosolic Na(+) transportation within vacuoles under high salinity, alleviating the Na(+) damage effects. The improved salt stress tolerance in TaNHX3 overexpressing tobacco plants is closely associated with the improvement of the aforementioned physiological processes. TaNHX3 can be used as a candidate gene for molecular breeding of salt-tolerant plants."

"24450772","abstracttext","Like many other filamentous ascomycetes, Fusarium graminearum contains two genes named CPK1 and CPK2 that encode the catalytic subunits of cyclic AMP (cAMP)-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). To determine the role of cAMP signaling in pathogenesis and development in F. graminearum, we functionally characterized these two genes. In addition, we generated and characterized the cpk1 cpk2 double and fac1 adenylate cyclase gene deletion mutants. The cpk1 mutant was significantly reduced in vegetative growth, conidiation, and deoxynivalenol production but it had increased tolerance to elevated temperatures. It was defective in the production of penetration branches on plant surfaces, colonization of wheat rachises, and spreading in flowering wheat heads. Deletion of CPK1 had no effect on perithecium development but the cpk1 mutant was defective in ascospore maturation and releasing. In contrast, the cpk2 mutant had no detectable phenotypes, suggesting that CPK2 contributes minimally to PKA activities in F. graminearum. Nevertheless, the cpk1 cpk2 double mutant had more severe defects in vegetative growth and rarely produced morphologically abnormal conidia. The double mutant, unlike the cpk1 or cpk2 mutant, was nonpathogenic and failed to form perithecia on self-mating plates. Therefore, CPK1 and CPK2 must have overlapping functions in vegetative growth, differentiation, and plant infection in F. graminearum. The fac1 mutant was also nonpathogenic and had growth defects similar to those of the cpk1 cpk2 mutant. However, deletion of FAC1 had no effect on conidium morphology. These results indicated that CPK1 is the major PKA catalytic subunit gene and that the cAMP-PKA pathway plays critical roles in hyphal growth, conidiation, ascosporogenesis, and plant infection in F. graminearum."
"26315512","articletitle","The wheat resistance gene Lr34 results in the constitutive induction of multiple defense pathways in transgenic barley."
"26315512","abstracttext","The wheat gene Lr34 encodes an ABCG-type transporter which provides durable resistance against multiple pathogens. Lr34 is functional as a transgene in barley, but its mode of action has remained largely unknown both in wheat and barley. Here we studied gene expression in uninfected barley lines transgenic for Lr34. Genes from multiple defense pathways contributing to basal and inducible disease resistance were constitutively active in seedlings and mature leaves. In addition, the hormones jasmonic acid and salicylic acid were induced to high levels, and increased levels of lignin as well as hordatines were observed. These results demonstrate a strong, constitutive re-programming of metabolism by Lr34. The resistant Lr34 allele (Lr34res) encodes a protein that differs by two amino acid polymorphisms from the susceptible Lr34sus allele. The deletion of a single phenylalanine residue in Lr34sus was sufficient to induce the characteristic Lr34-based responses. Combination of Lr34res and Lr34sus in the same plant resulted in a reduction of Lr34res expression by 8- to 20-fold when the low-expressing Lr34res line BG8 was used as a parent. Crosses with the high-expressing Lr34res line BG9 resulted in an increase of Lr34sus expression by 13- to 16-fold in progenies that inherited both alleles. These results indicate an interaction of the two Lr34 alleles on the transcriptional level. Reduction of Lr34res expression in BG8 crosses reduced the negative pleiotropic effects of Lr34res on barley growth and vigor without compromising disease resistance, suggesting that transgenic combination of Lr34res and Lr34sus can result in agronomically useful resistance."

"26176697","abstracttext","Identifying and mobilizing useful genetic variation from germplasm banks to breeding programs is an important strategy for sustaining crop genetic improvement. The molecular diversity of 1,423 spring bread wheat accessions representing major global production environments was investigated using high quality genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) loci, and gene-based markers for various adaptive and quality traits. Mean diversity index (DI) estimates revealed synthetic hexaploids to be genetically more diverse (DI= 0.284) than elites (DI = 0.267) and landraces (DI = 0.245). GBS markers discovered thousands of new SNP variations in the landraces which were well known to be adapted to drought (1273 novel GBS SNPs) and heat (4473 novel GBS SNPs) stress environments. This may open new avenues for pre-breeding by enriching the elite germplasm with novel alleles for drought and heat tolerance. Furthermore, new allelic variation for vernalization and glutenin genes was also identified from 47 landraces originating from Iraq, Iran, India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. The information generated in the study has been utilized to select 200 diverse gene bank accessions to harness their potential in pre-breeding and for allele mining of candidate genes for drought and heat stress tolerance, thus channeling novel variation into breeding pipelines. This research is part of CIMMYT's ongoing 'Seeds of Discovery' project visioning towards the development of high yielding wheat varieties that address future challenges from climate change."

"26113523","abstracttext","The identification and characterization of resistance genes effective against stripe rust of wheat is beneficial for modern wheat breeding programs. Molecular markers to such genes facilitate their deployment. The variety Milan has resistance that is effective against the predominant stripe rust races in the Sichuan region. Two resistant and two susceptible F8 lines from a cross between Milan and the susceptible variety Chuannong 16 were used to investigate inheritance of the Milan resistance. Three F2 populations were developed from crosses between the resistant lines and their susceptible sibling lines (LM168a × LM168c, LM168c × LM168a, LM168b × LM168d) and used for genetic analysis and molecular mapping of the genes for resistance. The stripe rust resistance in LM168a and LM168b was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated as YrLM168a. Forty-five extreme susceptible plants from the F2 families of LM168d × LM168b were genotyped with 836 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to map YrLM168a. YrLM168a was mapped in chromosome 6BL. The nearest flanking markers Xwmc756 and Xbarc146 were 4.6 and 4.6 cM away from the gene at both sides, respectively. The amplification results of twenty extreme resistant (IT 0) and susceptible (IT 4) F2 plants of LM168c × LM168a and LM168a × LM168c with marker Xwmc756 further validated the mapping results. The study suggested that extreme individuals and recessive phenotype class can be successfully used for mapping genes, which should be efficient and reliable. In addition, the flanking markers near YrLM168a should be helpful in marker-assisted breeding."

"25406468","abstracttext","Multiparental populations are innovative tools for fine mapping large numbers of loci. Here we explored the application of a wheat Multiparent Advanced Generation Inter-Cross (MAGIC) population for QTL mapping. This population was created by 12 generations of free recombination among 60 founder lines, following modification of the mating system from strict selfing to strict outcrossing using the ms1b nuclear male sterility gene. Available parents and a subset of 380 SSD lines of the resulting MAGIC population were phenotyped for earliness and genotyped with the 9K i-Select SNP array and additional markers in candidate genes controlling heading date. We demonstrated that 12 generations of strict outcrossing rapidly and drastically reduced linkage disequilibrium to very low levels even at short map distances and also greatly reduced the population structure exhibited among the parents. We developed a Bayesian method, based on allelic frequency, to estimate the contribution of each parent in the evolved population. To detect loci under selection and estimate selective pressure, we also developed a new method comparing shifts in allelic frequency between the initial and the evolved populations due to both selection and genetic drift with expectations under drift only. This evolutionary approach allowed us to identify 26 genomic areas under selection. Using association tests between flowering time and polymorphisms, 6 of these genomic areas appeared to carry flowering time QTL, 1 of which corresponds to Ppd-D1, a major gene involved in the photoperiod sensitivity. Frequency shifts at 4 of 6 areas were consistent with earlier flowering of the evolved population relative to the initial population. The use of this new outcrossing wheat population, mixing numerous initial parental lines through multiple generations of panmixia, is discussed in terms of power to detect genes under selection and association mapping. Furthermore we provide new statistical methods for use in future analyses of multiparental populations."

"25857259","abstracttext","The presence or absence of specific transcription factors, chromatin remodeling machineries, chromatin modification enzymes, post-translational histone modifications and histone variants all play crucial roles in the regulation of pathogenicity genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) provides an important tool to study genome-wide protein-DNA interactions to help understand gene regulation in the context of native chromatin. ChIP-seq is a convenient in vivo technique to identify, map and characterize occupancy of specific DNA fragments with proteins against which specific antibodies exist or which can be epitope-tagged in vivo. We optimized existing ChIP protocols for use in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici and closely related sister species. Here, we provide a detailed method, underscoring which aspects of the technique are organism-specific. Library preparation for Illumina sequencing is described, as this is currently the most widely used ChIP-seq method. One approach for the analysis and visualization of representative sequence is described; improved tools for these analyses are constantly being developed. Using ChIP-seq with antibodies against H3K4me2, which is considered a mark for euchromatin or H3K9me3 and H3K27me3, which are considered marks for heterochromatin, the overall distribution of euchromatin and heterochromatin in the genome of Z. tritici can be determined. Our ChIP-seq protocol was also successfully applied to Z. tritici strains with high levels of melanization or aberrant colony morphology, and to different species of the genus (Z. ardabiliae and Z. pseudotritici), suggesting that our technique is robust. The methods described here provide a powerful framework to study new aspects of chromatin biology and gene regulation in this prominent wheat pathogen."
"25957355","articletitle","High and Low Affinity Urea Root Uptake: Involvement of NIP5;1."
"25957355","abstracttext","Urea is the most widespread nitrogen (N) fertilizer worldwide and is rapidly degraded in soil to ammonium by urease. Ammonium is either taken up by plant roots or is further processed to nitrate by soil microorganisms. However, urea can be taken up by roots and is further degraded to ammonium by plant urease for assimilation. When urea is supplied under sterile conditions, it acts as a poor N source for seedlings or adult Arabidopsis thaliana plants. Here, the gene expression of young seedlings exposed to urea and ammonium nitrate nutrition was compared. Several primary metabolism and transport genes, including those for nitrate and urea, were differentially expressed in seedlings. However, urease and most major intrinsic proteins were not differentially expressed, with the exception of NIP6;1, a urea-permeable channel, which was repressed. Furthermore, little overlap with the gene expression with ammonium as the sole N source was observed, confirming that pure urea nutrition is not associated with the ammonium toxicity syndrome in seedlings. The direct root uptake of urea was increased under boron deficiency, in both the high and low affinity range. This activity was entirely mediated by the NIP5;1 channel, which was confirmed to transport urea when expressed in oocytes. The uptake of urea in the high and low affinity range was also determined for maize and wheat roots. The urea uptake by maize roots was only about half that of wheat, but was not stimulated by boron deficiency or N deficiency in either species. This analysis identifies novel components of the urea uptake systems in plants, which may become agronomically relevant to urea uptake and utilization, as stabilized urea fertilizers become increasingly popular."
"26092803","articletitle","Conditional promoters for analysis of essential genes in Zymoseptoria tritici."
"26092803","abstracttext","Development of new fungicides, needed for sustainable control of fungal plant pathogens, requires identification of novel anti-fungal targets. Essential fungal-specific proteins are good candidates, but due to their importance, gene deletion mutants are not viable. Consequently, their cellular role often remains elusive. This hindrance can be overcome by the use of conditional mutants, where expression is controlled by an inducible/repressible promoter. Here, we introduce 5 inducible/repressible promoter systems to study essential genes in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We fused the gene for enhanced green-fluorescent protein (egfp) to the promoter region of Z. tritici nitrate reductase (Pnar1; induced by nitrogen and repressed by ammonium), 1,4-β-endoxylanase A (Pex1A; induced by xylose and repressed by maltodextrin), l-arabinofuranosidase B (PlaraB; induced by arabinose and repressed by glucose), galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase 7 (Pgal7; induced by galactose and repressed by glucose) and isocitrate lyase (Picl1; induced by sodium acetate and repressed by glucose). This was followed by quantitative analysis of cytoplasmic reporter fluorescence under induced and repressed conditions. We show that Pnar1, PlaraB and Pex1A drive very little or no egfp expression when repressed, but induce moderate protein production when induced. In contrast, Pgal7 and Picl1 show considerable egfp expression when repressed, and were strongly induced in the presence of their inducers. Normalising the expression levels of all promoters to that of the α-tubulin promoter Ptub2 revealed that PlaraB was the weakest promoter (∼20% of Ptub2), whereas Picl1 strongly expressed the reporter (∼250% of Ptub2). The use of these tools promises a better understanding of essential genes, which will help developing novel control strategies that protect wheat from Z. tritici."

"26098844","abstracttext","Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, which causes wheat powdery mildew, is an obligate biotrophic pathogen that can easily genetically adapt to its host plant. Understanding the virulence structure of and genetic variations in this pathogen is essential for disease control and for breeding resistance to wheat powdery mildew. This study investigated 17 pathogenic populations in Sichuan, China and classified 109 isolates into two distinct groups based on pathogenicity analysis: high virulence (HV, 92 isolates) and low virulence (LV, 17 isolates). Populations from Yibin (Southern region), Xichang (Western region), and Meishan (Middle region) showed lower virulence frequencies than populations from other regions. Many of the previously known resistance genes did not confer resistance in this study. The resistance gene Pm21 displayed an immune response to pathogenic challenge with all populations in Sichuan, and Pm13, Pm5b, Pm2+6, and PmXBD maintained resistance. AMOVA revealed significantly higher levels of variation within populations and lower levels of variation among populations within regions. High levels of gene flow were detected among populations in the four regions. Closely related populations within each region were distinguished by cluster analyses using ISSR and SRAP alleles. Both ISSR and SRAP allele profiling analyses revealed high levels of genetic diversity among pathogenic populations in Sichuan. Although ISSR and SRAP profiling analysis showed similar resolutions, the SRAP alleles appeared to be more informative. We did not detect any significant association between these alleles and the virulence or pathogenicity of the pathogen. Our results suggest that ISSR and SRAP alleles are more efficient for the characterization of small or closely related populations versus distantly related populations."
"26051492","articletitle","A ToxA-like protein from Cochliobolus heterostrophus induces light-dependent leaf necrosis and acts as a virulence factor with host selectivity on maize."
"26051492","abstracttext","ToxA, the first discovered fungal proteinaceous host-selective toxin (HST), was originally identified in 1989 from the tan spot fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr). About 25years later, a homolog was identified in the leaf/glume blotch fungus Stagonospora nodorum (Parastagonospora nodorum), also a pathogen of wheat. Here we report the identification and function of a ToxA-like protein from the maize pathogen Cochliobolus heterostrophus (Ch) that possesses necrosis-inducing activity specifically against maize. ChToxA is encoded by a 535-bp open reading frame featuring a ToxA-specific intron with unusual splicing sites (5'-ATAAGT…TAC-3') at conserved positions relative to PtrToxA. The protein shows 64% similarity to PtrToxA and is predicted to adopt a similar three-dimensional structure, although lacking the arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid (RGD) motif reported to be required for internalization into sensitive wheat mesophyll cells. Reverse-transcriptase PCR revealed that the ChTOXA gene expression is up-regulated in planta, relative to axenic culture. Plant assays indicated that the recombinant ChToxA protein induces light-dependent leaf necrosis in a host-selective manner on maize inbred lines. Gene deletion experiments confirmed that ChtoxA mutants are reduced in virulence on specific ChToxA-sensitive maize lines, relative to virulence caused by wild-type strains. Database searches identified potential ChToxA homologues in other plant-pathogenic ascomycetes. Sequence and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the corresponding ToxA-like proteins include one member recently shown to be associated with formation of penetration hypha. These results provide the first evidence that C. heterostrophus is capable of producing proteinaceous HSTs as virulence factors in addition to well-known secondary metabolite-type toxins produced biosynthetically by polyketide synthase megaenzymes. Further studies on ChToxA may provide new insights into effector evolution in host-pathogen interactions."

"25774162","abstracttext","Plant-specific NAC transcription factors (TFs) constitute a large family and play important roles in regulating plant developmental processes and responses to environmental stresses, but only some of them have been investigated for effects on disease reaction in cereal crops. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an effective strategy for rapid functional analysis of genes in plant tissues. In this study, TaNAC1, encoding a new member of the NAC1 subgroup, was cloned from bread wheat and characterized. It is a TF localized in the cell nucleus, and contains an activation domain in its C-terminal. TaNAC1 was strongly expressed in wheat roots and was involved in responses to infection by the obligate pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and defense-related hormone treatments such as salicylic acid (SA), methyl jasmonate, and ethylene. Knockdown of TaNAC1 with barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) enhanced stripe rust resistance. TaNAC1-overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana plants gave enhanced susceptibility, attenuated systemic-acquired resistance to Pseudomonas syringae DC3000, and promoted lateral root development. Jasmonic acid-signaling pathway genes PDF1.2 and ORA59 were constitutively expressed in transgenic plants. TaNAC1 overexpression suppressed the expression levels of resistance-related genes PR1 and PR2 involved in SA signaling and AtWRKY70, which functions as a connection node between the JA- and SA-signaling pathways. Collectively, TaNAC1 is a novel NAC member of the NAC1 subgroup, negatively regulates plant disease resistance, and may modulate plant JA- and SA-signaling defense cascades."

"26074495","abstracttext","Septoria tritici blotch (STB) caused by the Ascomycete fungus Zymoseptoria tritici is one of the most economically damaging diseases of wheat worldwide. Z. tritici is currently a major target for agricultural fungicides, especially in temperate regions where it is most prevalent. Many fungicides target electron transfer enzymes because these are often important for cell function. Therefore characterisation of genes encoding such enzymes may be important for the development of novel disease intervention strategies. Microsomal cytochrome b5 reductases (CBRs) are an important family of electron transfer proteins which in eukaryotes are involved in the biosynthesis of fatty acids and complex lipids including sphingolipids and sterols. Unlike the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae which possesses only one microsomal CBR, the fully sequenced genome of Z. tritici bears three possible microsomal CBRs. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that ZtCBR1 is the most highly expressed of these genes under all in vitro and in planta conditions tested, therefore ΔZtCBR1 mutant strains were generated through targeted gene disruption. These strains exhibited delayed disease symptoms on wheat leaves and severely limited asexual sporulation. ΔZtCBR1 strains also exhibited aberrant spore morphology and hyphal growth in vitro. These defects coincided with alterations in fatty acid, sphingolipid and sterol biosynthesis observed through GC-MS and HPLC analyses. Data is presented which suggests that Z. tritici may use ZtCBR1 as an additional electron donor for key steps in ergosterol biosynthesis, one of which is targeted by azole fungicides. Our study reports the first functional characterisation of CBR gene family members in a plant pathogenic filamentous fungus. This also represents the first direct observation of CBR functional ablation impacting upon fungal sterol biosynthesis."
"26650838","articletitle","The stay-green phenotype of wheat mutant tasg1 is associated with altered cytokinin metabolism."
"26650838","abstracttext_key message","By measuring the cytokinin content directly and testing the sensitivity to the cytokinin inhibitor lovastatin, we demonstrated that tasg1 cytokinin metabolism is different from wild-type. Our previous studies have indicated that compared with wild-type (WT) plants, a wheat stay-green mutant tasg1 exhibited delayed senescence. In this study, we found that the root development of tasg1 occurred later than that of WT. The number of lateral roots was fewer, but the lateral root length was longer in tasg1 than in WT, which resulted in a lower root to shoot ratio in tasg1 than WT. The levels of cytokinin (CK), CK activity, and expression of CK metabolic genes were measured. We found that the total CK content in the root tips and leaf of tasg1 was greater than in WT. The accumulation of mRNA of the CK synthetic gene (TaIPT) in tasg1 was higher than in WT at 9 and 11 days during seedling growth, but the expression of CK oxidase gene (TaCKX) was significantly lower in tasg1. Furthermore, the CK inhibitor lovastatin was used to inhibit CK activity. When treated with lovastatin, both the chlorophyll content and thylakoid membrane protein stability were significantly lower in tasg1 than WT, consistent with the inhibited expression of senescence-associated genes (TaSAGs) in tasg1. Lovastatin treatment also inhibited the antioxidative capability of wheat seedlings, and tasg1 was more sensitive to lovastatin than WT, as indicated by the MDA content, protein carbonylation, and antioxidant enzyme activity. The decreased antioxidative capability after lovastatin treatment may be related to the down-regulation of some antioxidase genes. These results suggest that the CK metabolism was altered in tasg1, which may play an important role in its ability to delay senescence."

"26610174","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici causes Septoria tritici blotch (STB) on wheat. The disease interaction is characterized by clearly defined temporal phases of infection, ultimately resulting in the death of host tissue. Zymoseptoria tritici is a highly polymorphic species with significant intraspecific variation in virulence profiles. We generated a deep transcriptomic sequencing dataset spanning the entire time course of an infection using a previously uncharacterized, highly virulent Z. tritici strain isolated from a Swiss wheat field. We found that seven clusters of gene transcription profiles explained the progression of the infection. The earliest highly up-regulated genes included chloroperoxidases, which may help the fungus cope with plant defences. The onset of necrotrophy was characterized by a concerted up-regulation of proteases, plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and lipases. Functions related to nutrition and growth characterized late necrotrophy and the transition to saprotrophic growth on dead plant tissue. We found that the peak up-regulation of genes essential for mating coincided with the necrotrophic phase. We performed an intraspecies comparative transcriptomics analysis using a comparable time course infection experiment of the genome reference isolate IPO323. Major components of the fungal infection transcriptome were conserved between the two strains. However, individual small, secreted proteins, proteases and cell wall-degrading enzymes showed strongly differentiated transcriptional profiles between isolates. Our analyses illustrate that successful STB infections involve complex transcriptomic remodelling to up-regulate distinct gene functions. Heterogeneity in transcriptomes among isolates may explain some of the considerable variation in virulence and host specialization found within the species."
"27073898","articletitle","Overexpression of the Wheat Expansin Gene TaEXPA2 Improved Seed Production and Drought Tolerance in Transgenic Tobacco Plants."
"27073898","abstracttext","Expansins are cell wall proteins that are grouped into two main families, α-expansins and β-expansins, and they are implicated in the control of cell extension via the disruption of hydrogen bonds between cellulose and matrix glucans. TaEXPA2 is an α-expansin gene identified in wheat. Based on putative cis-regulatory elements in the TaEXPA2 promoter sequence and the expression pattern induced when polyethylene glycol (PEG) is used to mimic water stress, we hypothesized that TaEXPA2 is involved in plant drought tolerance and plant development. Through transient expression of 35S::TaEXPA2-GFP in onion epidermal cells, TaEXPA2 was localized to the cell wall. Constitutive expression of TaEXPA2 in tobacco improved seed production by increasing capsule number, not seed size, without having any effect on plant growth patterns. The transgenic tobacco exhibited a significantly greater tolerance to water-deficiency stress than did wild-type (WT) plants. We found that under drought stress, the transgenic plants maintained a better water status. The accumulated content of osmotic adjustment substances, such as proline, in TaEXPA2 transgenic plants was greater than that in WT plants. Transgenic plants also displayed greater antioxidative competence as indicated by their lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content, relative electrical conductivity, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation than did WT plants. This result suggests that the transgenic plants suffer less damage from ROS under drought conditions. The activities of some antioxidant enzymes as well as expression levels of several genes encoding key antioxidant enzymes were higher in the transgenic plants than in the WT plants under drought stress. Collectively, our results suggest that ectopic expression of the wheat expansin gene TaEXPA2 improves seed production and drought tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants."

"27111799","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici (previously Mycosphaerella graminicola) causes Septoria tritici blotch (STB) on wheat. The population biology of Z. tritici has been exceptionally well characterized as a result of intensive studies conducted over nearly 30 years. These studies provided important insights into the biology, epidemiology and evolutionary history of Z. tritici that will prove useful for management of STB. The well-documented, rapid adaptation of Z. tritici populations to fungicide applications and deployment of wheat cultivars carrying both major gene and quantitative resistance reflects the high evolutionary potential predicted by the large effective population size, high degree of gene flow and high levels of recombination found in field populations of Z. tritici globally. QST studies that assessed the global diversity for several important quantitative traits confirmed the adaptive potential of field populations and laid the groundwork for quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping studies. QTL mapping elucidated the genetic architecture of each trait and led to identification of candidate genes affecting fungicide resistance, thermal adaptation, virulence, and host specialization. The insights that emerged through these analyses of Z. tritici population biology can now be used to generate actionable disease management strategies aimed at sustainably reducing losses due to STB. The high evolutionary potential found in field populations of Z. tritici requires deployment of a corresponding dynamically diverse set of control measures that integrate cultural, chemical, biological and resistance breeding strategies. In this review, we describe and prioritize STB control strategies based on current knowledge of Z. tritici population biology and propose a future research agenda oriented toward long-term STB management."

"27212788","abstracttext","Reduced height 8 ( Rht8 ) is the main alternative to the GA-insensitive Rht alleles in hot and dry environments where it reduces plant height without yield penalty. The potential of Rht8 in northern-European wheat breeding remains unclear, since the close linkage with the photoperiod-insensitive allele Ppd-D1a is unfavourable in the relatively cool summers. In the present study, two near-isogenic lines (NILs) contrasting for the Rht8 /tall allele from Mara in a UK-adapted and photoperiod-sensitive wheat variety were evaluated in trials with varying nitrogen fertiliser (N) treatments and water regimes across sites in the UK and Spain. The Rht8 introgression was associated with a robust height reduction of 11% regardless of N treatment and water regime and the Rht8 NIL was more resistant to root-lodging at agronomically-relevant N levels than the tall NIL. In the UK with reduced solar radiation over the growing season than the site in Spain, the Rht8 NIL showed a 10% yield penalty at standard agronomic N levels due to concomitant reduction in grain number and spike number whereas grain weight and harvest index were not significantly different to the tall NIL. The yield penalty associated with the Rht8 introgression was overcome at low N and in irrigated conditions in the UK, and in the high-temperature site in Spain. Decreased spike length and constant spikelet number in the Rht8 NIL resulted in spike compaction of 15%, independent of N and water regime. The genetic interval of Rht8 overlaps with the compactum gene on 2DS, raising the possibility of the same causative gene. Further genetic dissection of these loci is required."

Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is an important disease of wheat that can be controlled by effective stem rust resistance (Sr) genes. The emergence of virulent Pgt races in Africa, namely Ug99 and its variants, has stimulated the search for new Sr genes and genetic characterization of known sources of resistance. Triumph 64 is a winter wheat cultivar that carries gene SrTmp, which confers resistance to Ug99. The goals of this study were to genetically map SrTmp and examine its relationship with other Sr genes occupying a similar chromosome location. A doubled haploid (DH) population from the cross LMPG-6S/Triumph 64 was inoculated with Ug99 at the seedling stage. A single gene conditioning resistance to Ug99 segregated in the population. Genetic mapping with SSR markers placed SrTmp on chromosome arm 6DS in a region similar to SrCad and Sr42. SNP markers developed for SrCad were used to further map SrTmp and were also added to a genetic map of Sr42 using a DH population (LMPG-6S/Norin 40). Three SNP markers that co-segregated with SrTmp also co-segregated with SrCad and Sr42. The SNP markers showed no difference in the map locations of SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42. Multi-race testing with DH lines from the Triumph 64 and Norin 40 populations and a recombinant inbred-line population from the cross LMPG-6S/AC Cadillac showed that SrTmp, SrCad, and Sr42 confer different spectra of resistance. Markers closely linked to SrTmp are suitable for marker-assisted breeding and germplasm development."

"27521918","abstracttext","The bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi (L.), is one of the most important wheat pests. This aphid damages through direct feeding and by transmitting the Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV). Both types of damage significantly reduce the quality and yield of wheat crops globally. Insecticides are the primary method of controlling the bird cherry-oat aphid in China, yet this aphid species has developed resistance to different types of insecticides, especially organophosphates and carbamates. In the last decade, control of R. padi depends primarily on the spray of neonicotinoid insecticides, however, research on the resistance of R. padi to neonicotinoids has been limited. In this study, the full lengths of seven α-subunit (Rpα1, Rpα2, Rpα3, Rpα4, Rpα5, Rpα7-1, and Rpα7-2) and one β-subunit (Rpβ1) genes from R. padi were obtained with RT-PCR and RACE techniques. Sequence analysis showed that these genes had all the characteristics of the nAChR gene family and were highly homologous with the reported nAChR genes from other insects, and alternative splicing was detected in Rpα3 and Rpα5 subunits. Analysis of the cDNA sequence of the extracellular region of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor β1 subunit gene from 120 R. padi field samples collected in 11 Provinces revealed 17 single nucleotides polymorphism (SNP) sites, of which seven were amino acid polymorphism sites (V53I, V53G, N54T, A60T, F61L, W79C, and V83I) and two were in the loop D region (W79C and V83I). The current study will facilitate further studies on the molecular mechanisms of targeted resistance of the aphid to neonicotinoid insecticides."
"28716418","articletitle","Wheat ROP proteins modulate defense response through lignin metabolism."
"28716418","abstracttext","ROP is a subfamily of small GTP-binding proteins that uniquely exist in plants. It acts as versatile molecular switches that regulate various developmental processes. Some ROP proteins are also reported to affect defense responses, although their exact mechanism is not fully understood. Herein, ROP members in wheat were mined; the functions of three wheat ROP proteins were studied. RT-PCR results showed that the expression of TaRac1 was rapidly and strongly induced after leaf rust infection. TaRac1 interacted with TaCCR in yeast-hybridization assay. The overexpression of TaRac1 in tobacco promoted CCR and CAD gene expression, increased the total lignin content and sinapyl lignin proportion, and then enhanced resistance to tobacco black shank and bacterial wilt diseases. In contrast, TaRac3 and TaRac4 did not show to interact with TaCCR. Furthermore, the overexpression of TaRac3 and TaRac4 did not increase lignin gene expression and lignin accumulation either. Unlike TaRac1, the overexpression of TaRac3 increased susceptibility to both black shank and bacterial wilt pathogens, while overexpression of TaRac4 showed no effect on disease resistance but promoted the root growth in tobacco seedling. These data collectively suggest that TaRac1 in Group II is mainly involved in regulating lignin metabolism which, in turn, responsible for the observed roles in pathogen resistance. TaRac3 and TaRac4 have the minor roles in defense response but may act on regulation in plant developmental processes. These results shed light on the complexity and diverse function of ROP in plant defense pathway."

"29163626","abstracttext","Pm21 , originating from wheat wild relative Dasypyrum villosum , confers immunity to all known races of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ) and has been widely utilized in wheat breeding. However, little is known on the genetic basis of the Pm21 locus. In the present study, four seedling-susceptible D. villosum lines (DvSus-1 ∼ DvSus-4) were identified from different natural populations. Based on the collinearity among genomes of Brachypodium distachyon, Oryza , and Triticeae , a set of 25 gene-derived markers were developed declaring the polymorphisms between DvRes-1 carrying Pm21 and DvSus-1. Fine genetic mapping of Pm21 was conducted by using an extremely large F 2 segregation population derived from the cross DvSus-1/DvRes-1. Then Pm21 was narrowed to a 0.01-cM genetic interval defined by the markers 6VS-08.4b and 6VS-10b. Three DNA markers, including a resistance gene analog marker, were confirmed to co-segregate with Pm21 . Moreover, based on the susceptible deletion line Y18-S6 induced by ethyl methanesulfonate treatment conducted on Yangmai 18, Pm21 was physically mapped into a similar interval. Comparative analysis revealed that the orthologous regions of the interval carrying Pm21 were narrowed to a 112.5 kb genomic region harboring 18 genes in Brachypodium , and a 23.2 kb region harboring two genes in rice, respectively. This study provides a high-density integrated map of the Pm21 locus, which will contribute to map-based cloning of Pm21 ."
"28398875","articletitle","Vulnerability of Barley to African Pathotypes of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and Sources of Resistance."
"28398875","abstracttext","The emergence of widely virulent pathotypes (e.g., TTKSK in the Ug99 race group) of the stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) in Africa threatens wheat production on a global scale. Although intensive research efforts have been advanced to address this threat in wheat, few studies have been conducted on barley, even though pathotypes such as TTKSK are known to attack the crop. The main objectives of this study were to assess the vulnerability of barley to pathotype TTKSK and identify possible sources of resistance. From seedling evaluations of more than 1,924 diverse cultivated barley accessions to pathotype TTKSK, more than 95% (1,844) were found susceptible. A similar high frequency (910 of 934 = 97.4%) of susceptibility was found for the wild progenitor (Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum) of cultivated barley. Additionally, 55 barley lines with characterized or putative introgressions from various wild Hordeum spp. were also tested against pathotype TTKSK but none was found resistant. In total, more than 96% of the 2,913 Hordeum accessions tested were susceptible as seedlings, indicating the extreme vulnerability of the crop to the African pathotypes of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. In total, 32 (1.7% of accessions evaluated) and 13 (1.4%) cultivated and wild barley accessions, respectively, exhibited consistently highly resistant to moderately resistant reactions across all experiments. Molecular assays were conducted on these resistant accessions to determine whether they carried rpg4/Rpg5, the only gene complex known to be highly effective against pathotype TTKSK in barley. Twelve of the 32 (37.5%) resistant cultivated accessions and 11 of the 13 (84.6%) resistant wild barley accessions tested positive for a functional Rpg5 gene, highlighting the narrow genetic base of resistance in Hordeum spp. Other resistant accessions lacking the rpg4/Rpg5 complex were discovered in the evaluated germplasm and may possess useful resistance genes. Combining rpg4/Rpg5 with resistance genes from these other sources should provide more durable resistance against the array of different virulence types in the Ug99 race group."

"27545692","abstracttext","High salinity is one of the most serious environmental stresses that limit crop growth. Expansins are cell wall proteins that regulate plant development and abiotic stress tolerance by mediating cell wall expansion. We studied the function of a wheat expansin gene, TaEXPA2, in salt stress tolerance by overexpressing it in tobacco. Overexpression of TaEXPA2 enhanced the salt stress tolerance of transgenic tobacco plants as indicated by the presence of higher germination rates, longer root length, more lateral roots, higher survival rates and more green leaves under salt stress than in the wild type (WT). Further, when leaf disks of WT plants were incubated in cell wall protein extracts from the transgenic tobacco plants, their chlorophyll content was higher under salt stress, and this improvement from TaEXPA2 overexpression in transgenic tobacco was inhibited by TaEXPA2 protein antibody. The water status of transgenic tobacco plants was improved, perhaps by the accumulation of osmolytes such as proline and soluble sugar. TaEXPA2-overexpressing tobacco lines exhibited lower Na + but higher K + accumulation than WT plants. Antioxidant competence increased in the transgenic plants because of the increased activity of antioxidant enzymes. TaEXPA2 protein abundance in wheat was induced by NaCl, and ABA signaling was involved. Gene expression regulation was involved in the enhanced salt stress tolerance of the TaEXPA2 transgenic plants. Our results suggest that TaEXPA2 overexpression confers salt stress tolerance on the transgenic plants, and this is associated with improved water status, Na + /K + homeostasis, and antioxidant competence. ABA signaling participates in TaEXPA2-regulated salt stress tolerance."
"27835660","articletitle","Two FgLEU2 Genes with Different Roles in Leucine Biosynthesis and Infection-Related Morphogenesis in Fusarium graminearum."
"27835660","abstracttext","3-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase (IPMD) encoded by LEU2 is a key enzyme in leucine (Leu) biosynthetic pathway. Analysis of the genome sequence of Fusarium graminearum revealed two paralogous LEU2 genes (designated as FgLEU2A and FgLEU2B) in this fungus and the deduced amino acid sequences of FgLeu2A and FgLeu2B share 45% identity. Targeted disruption of individual FgLEU2A/B gene in F. graminearum assigned a more crucial role of FgLeu2A in Leu biosynthesis as disruption of FgLEU2A resulted in mutant (ΔFgLeu2A-10) that was Leu-auxotrophic and could not grow in minimal medium limited for amino acids, whereas FgLEU2B deletion mutant ΔFgLeu2B-2 was morphologically indistinguishable from the wild type strain PH-1. The growth defects of ΔFgLeu2A-10 could be overcome by exogenous addition of Leu at 0.25 mM. Double deletion of FgLEU2A and FgLEU2B (ΔFgLeu2AB-8) caused a more severe Leu-auxotrophic phenotype as the concentration of Leu exogenously added to medium to rescue the growth defect of ΔFgLeu2AB-8 should be raised to 1.25 mM, indicating a less important but nonnegligible role of FgLeu2B in Leu biosynthesis. Disturb of Leu biosynthesis caused by FgLEU2A deletion leads to slower growth rate, reduced aerial hyphal formation and red pigmentation on PDA plates and completely blocked conidial production and germination. All of the defects above could be overcome by Leu addition or complementation of the full-length FgLEU2A gene. ΔFgLeu2A-10 also showed significantly increased sensitivity to osmotic and oxidative stresses. Pathogenicity assay results showed that virulence of mutants lacking FgLEU2A were dramatically impaired on wheat heads and non-host cherry tomatoes. Additionally, a low level of deoxynivalenol (DON) production of ΔFgLeu2A-10 and ΔFgLeu2AB-8 in wheat kernels was also detected. Taken together, results of this study indicated a crucial role of FgLeu2A and a less important role of FgLeu2B in Leu biosynthesis and fungal infection-related morphogenesis in F. graminearum and FgLeu2A may serve as a potential target for novel antifungal development."

"28018415","abstracttext","Certain plant growth promoting bacteria can protect associated plants from harmful effects of salinity. We report the isolation and characterization of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase bacterium Bacillus licheniformis HSW-16 capable of ameliorating salt (NaCl) stress in wheat plants. The bacterium was isolated from the water of Sambhar salt lake, Rajasthan, India. The presence of ACC deaminase activity was confirmed by enzyme assay and analysis of AcdS gene, a structural gene for ACC deaminase. Inoculation of B. licheniformis HSW-16 protected wheat plants from growth inhibition caused by NaCl and increased plant growth (6-38%) in terms of root length, shoot length, fresh weight, and dry weight. Ionic analysis of plant samples showed that the bacterial inoculation decreased the accumulation of Na + content (51%), and increased K + (68%), and Ca 2+ content (32%) in plants at different concentration of NaCl. It suggested that bacterial inoculation protected plants from the effect of NaCl by decreasing the level of Na + in plants. Production of exopolysaccharide by the B. licheniformis HSW-16 can also protect from Na + by binding this ion. Moreover, application of test isolate resulted in an increase in certain osmolytes such as total soluble sugar, total protein content, and a decrease in malondialdehyde content, illustrating their role in the protection of plants. The ability of B. licheniformis HSW-16 to colonize plant root surface was examined by staining the bacterium with acridine orange followed by fluorescence microscopy and polymerase chain reaction-based DNA finger printing analysis. These results suggested that B. licheniformis HSW-16 could be used as a bioinoculant to improve the productivity of plants growing under salt stress."

"28199789","articletitle","Cholesterol-Lowering Activity of Tartary Buckwheat Protein."
"28199789","abstracttext","Previous research has shown that Tartary buckwheat flour is capable of reducing plasma cholesterol. The present study was to examine the effect of rutin and Tartary buckwheat protein on plasma total cholesterol (TC) in hypercholesterolemia hamsters. In the first animal experiment, 40 male hamsters were divided into four groups fed either the control diet or one of the three experimental diets containing 8.2 mmol rutin, 8.2 mmol quercetin, or 2.5 g kg -1 cholestyramine, respectively. Results showed that only cholestyramine but not rutin and its aglycone quercetin decreased plasma TC, which suggested that rutin was not the active ingredient responsible for plasma TC-lowering activity of Tartary buckwheat flour. In the second animal experiment, 45 male hamsters were divided into five groups fed either the control diet or one of the four experimental diets containing 24% Tartary buckwheat protein, 24% rice protein, 24% wheat protein, or 5 g kg -1 cholestyramine, respectively. Tartary buckwheat protein reduced plasma TC more effectively than cholestyramine (45% versus 37%), while rice and wheat proteins only reduced plasma TC by 10-13%. Tartary buckwheat protein caused 108% increase in the fecal excretion of total neutral sterols and 263% increase in the fecal excretion of total acidic sterols. real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses showed that Tartary buckwheat protein affected the gene expression of intestinal Niemann-Pick C1-like protein 1 (NPC1L1), acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), and ATP binding cassette transporters 5 and 8 (ABCG5/8) in a down trend, whereas it increased the gene expression of hepatic cholesterol-7α -hydroxylase (CYP7A1). It was concluded that Tartary buckwheat protein was at least one of the active ingredients in Tartary buckwheat flour to lower plasma TC, mainly mediated by enhancing the excretion of bile acids via up-regulation of hepatic CYP7A1 and also by inhibiting the absorption of dietary cholesterol via down-regulation on intestinal NPC1L1, ACAT2 and ABCG5/8."

"28314934","abstracttext_key message","A novel Wx-B1 allele was characterized; a transposon insertion resulted in the loss of its function, which is different from the previously reported gene silencing mechanisms at the Wx-B1 locus. The waxy protein composition of 53 Chinese wheat landraces was analyzed using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis; of these, 10 did not show the expression of Wx-A1 (four accession) or Wx-B1 (six accessions) protein. The results of molecular marker detection revealed that the Wx-B1 allele (Wx-B1n) showed normal expression, inconsistent with the findings of SDS-PAGE for the Xiaobaipi accession. Further cloning of the 9160-bp region covering the Wx-B1 coding region and 3'-downstream region revealed that a 2178-bp transposon fragment had been inserted at 2462 bp within the tenth exon of Wx-B1n ORF, leading to the absence of Wx-B1 protein. Sequence analysis indicated that the insertion possessed the structural features of invert repeat and target repeat elements, we deduced that it was a transposon. Further PCR analysis revealed that this fragment had moved, but not copied itself, from 3B chromosome to the current location in Wx-B1n. Therefore, the reason for the inactivation of Wx-B1n was considerably different from those for the inactivation of Wx-B1b, Wx-B1k, and Wx-B1m; to our knowledge, this kind of structural mutation has never been reported in Wx-B1 alleles. This novel allele is interesting, because it was not associated with the deletion of other quality-related genes included in the 67 kb region lost with the common null allele Wx-B1b. The null Wx-B1n might be useful for investigating gene inactivation and expression as well as for enriching the genetic resource pool for the modification of the amylose/amylopectin ratio, thereby improving wheat quality."

The coding sequence (CDS) is 1086 bp in length and encodes a protein of 361 amino acids that exhibits functional domains shared with SnRK2s. Based on the haplotypes of TaSnRK2.10-4A (Hap-4A-H and Hap-4A-L), a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker designated TaSnRK2.10-4A-CAPS was developed and mapped between the markers D-1092101 and D-100014232 using a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs).

Here, we investigated the effect of dietary fibres on the abundance, composition, and activity of butyrate-producing bacteria in suckling piglets. Piglets were fed a control diet or creep feeds containing alfalfa, wheat bran, or pure cellulose, respectively, from postnatal day 7 to 22. Large intestinal digesta and mucosa samples were collected for quantitative analysis of bacterial group-specific 16S ribosomal RNA- and butyrate production-related genes, and digesta samples for quantification of short-chain fatty acids. The alfalfa diet increased (P < 0.05) Clostridium cluster XIVa abundance, copies of genes encoding proteins involved in butyrate production (butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase, butyrate kinase), and butyrate concentration compared to the wheat bran diet in the digesta of the proximal colon. In the distal colonic digesta, animals fed the alfalfa diet had the highest number of butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene copies (P < 0.05) and numerically the highest butyrate concentration, albeit not significant (P > 0.05), compared to other groups. In the distal colonic mucosa, the cellulose diet increased (P < 0.05) the abundance of Clostridium cluster XIVa and copies of the butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase gene compared to the alfalfa diet. These results indicated that dietary fibres modulate the abundance and activity of butyrate-producing bacteria in the large intestine of suckling piglets, and that a moderate supplementation of alfalfa and cellulose may benefit early-life gut health through the delivery of butyrate to the mucosa."
"29603502","articletitle","Microbial mechanisms of carbon priming effects revealed during the interaction of crop residue and nutrient inputs in contrasting soils."
"29603502","abstracttext","Agronomic practices such as crop residue return and additional nutrient supply are recommended to increase soil organic carbon (SOC) in arable farmlands. However, changes in the priming effect (PE) on native SOC mineralization in response to integrated inputs of residue and nutrients are not fully known. This knowledge gap along with a lack of understanding of microbial mechanisms hinders the ability to constrain models and to reduce the uncertainty to predict carbon (C) sequestration potential. Using a 13 C-labeled wheat residue, this 126-day incubation study examined the dominant microbial mechanisms that underpin the PE response to inputs of wheat residue and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus and sulfur) in two contrasting soils. The residue input caused positive PE through ""co-metabolism,"" supported by increased microbial biomass, C and nitrogen (N) extracellular enzyme activities (EEAs), and gene abundance of certain microbial taxa (Eubacteria, β-Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Fungi). The residue input could have induced nutrient limitation, causing an increase in the PE via ""microbial nutrient mining"" of native soil organic matter, as suggested by the low C-to-nutrient stoichiometry of EEAs. At the high residue, exogenous nutrient supply (cf. no-nutrient) initially decreased positive PE by alleviating nutrient mining, which was supported by the low gene abundance of Eubacteria and Fungi. However, after an initial decrease in PE at the high residue with nutrients, the PE increased to the same magnitude as without nutrients over time. This suggests the dominance of ""microbial stoichiometry decomposition,"" supported by higher microbial biomass and EEAs, while Eubacteria and Fungi increased over time, at the high residue with nutrients cf. no-nutrient in both soils. Our study provides novel evidence that different microbial mechanisms operate simultaneously depending on organic C and nutrient availability in a residue-amended soil. Our results have consequences for SOC modeling and integrated nutrient management employed to increase SOC in arable farmlands."

"28829795","abstracttext","A forward genetics approach was applied in order to investigate the molecular basis of morphological transition in the wheat pathogenic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici. Z. tritici is a dimorphic plant pathogen displaying environmentally regulated morphogenetic transition between yeast-like and hyphal growth. Considering the infection mode of Z. tritici, the switching to hyphal growth is essential for pathogenicity allowing the fungus the host invasion through natural openings like stomata. We exploited a previously developed Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT) to generate a mutant library by insertional mutagenesis including more than 10,000 random mutants. To identify genes involved in dimorphic switch, a plate-based screening system was established. With this approach eleven dimorphic switch deficient random mutants were recovered, ten of which exhibited a yeast-like mode of growth and one mutant predominantly growing filamentously, producing high amount of mycelium under different incubation conditions. Using genome walking approach previously established, the T-DNA integration sites were recovered and the disrupted genomic loci of corresponding mutants were identified and validated within reverse genetics approach. As prove of concept, two of the random mutants obtained were selected for further investigation using targeted gene inactivation. Both genes deduced were found to encode known factors, previously characterized in other fungi: Ssk1p being constituent of HOG pathway and Ade5,7p involved in de novo purine biosynthesis. The targeted mutant strains defective in these genes exhibit a drastically impaired virulence within infection assays on whole wheat plants. Moreover exploiting further physiological assays the predicted function for both gene products could be confirmed in concordance with conserved biological role of homologous proteins previously described in other fungal organisms."

"29775863","abstracttext","Nonhost resistance is the most common form of disease resistance exhibited by plants against most pathogenic microorganisms. Type I nonhost resistance is symptomless (i.e. no macroscopically visible cell/tissue death), implying an early halt of pathogen growth. The timing/speed of defences is much more rapid during type I nonhost resistance than during type II nonhost and host (""gene-for-gene"") resistance associated with a hypersensitive response (localized necrosis, HR). However, the mechanism(s) underlying symptomless (type I) nonhost resistance is not entirely understood. Here we assessed accumulation dynamics of the reactive oxygen species superoxide (O 2 .- ) during interactions of plants with a range of biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens resulting in susceptibility, symptomless nonhost resistance or host resistance with HR. Our results show that the timing of macroscopically detectable superoxide accumulation (1-4 days after inoculation, DAI) is always associated with the speed of the defense response (symptomless nonhost resistance vs. host resistance with HR) in inoculated leaves. The relatively early (1 DAI) superoxide accumulation during symptomless nonhost resistance of barley to wheat powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) is localized to mesophyll chloroplasts of inoculated leaves and coupled to enhanced NADPH oxidase (EC 1.6.3.1) activity and transient increases in expression of genes regulating superoxide levels and cell death (superoxide dismutase, HvSOD1 and BAX inhibitor-1, HvBI-1). Importantly, the partial suppression of symptomless nonhost resistance of barley to wheat powdery mildew by heat shock (49 °C, 45 s) and antioxidant (SOD and catalase) treatments points to a functional role of superoxide in symptomless (type I) nonhost resistance."

"29939987","abstracttext","To generate a genetic resource of heat stress responsive genes/ESTs, suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) library was constructed in a heat and drought stress tolerant Indian bread wheat cultivar C306. Ninety three days old plants during grain filling stage were subjected to heat stress at an elevated temperature of 37°C and 42°C for different time intervals (30 min, 1h, 2h, 4h, and 6h). Two subtractive cDNA libraries were prepared with RNA isolated from leaf samples at 37°C and 42°C heat stress. The ESTs obtained were reconfirmed by reverse northern dot blot hybridization. A total of 175 contigs and 403 singlets were obtained from 1728 ESTs by gene ontology analysis. Differential expression under heat stress was validated for a few selected genes (10) by qRT-PCR. A transcript showing homology to Hsp90 was observed to be upregulated (7.6 fold) under heat stress in cv. C306. CDS of TaHsp90 (Accession no. MF383197) was isolated from cv. C306 and characterized. Heterologous expression of TaHsp90 was validated in E. coli BL21 and confirmed by protein gel blot and MALDI-TOF analysis. Computational based analysis was carried out to understand the molecular functioning of TaHsp90. The heat stress responsive SSH library developed led to identification of a number of heat responsive genes/ESTs, which can be utilized for unravelling the heat tolerance mechanism in wheat. Gene TaHsp90 isolated and characterized in the present study can be utilized for developing heat tolerant transgenic crops."

The ab initio gene prediction was performed using Ustilago maydis as the reference species. A total number of 10,113 genes were predicted with an average gene size of 1945 bp out of which functionally annotated genes were 7262. A total number of 3216 protein-coding genes were assigned in different categories. Out of a total number of 1877 transposable elements, gypsy had the highest count (573). Total 5772 simple sequence repeats were identified in the genome assembly, and the most abundant simple sequence repeat type was trinucleotide having 42% of total SSRs. The comparative genome analysis suggested 3751 proteins of T . indica had orthologs in five fungi, whereas 126 proteins were unique to T . indica . Secretome analysis revealed the presence of 1014 secretory proteins and few carbohydrate-active enzymes in the genome. Some putative candidate pathogenicity-related genes were identified in the genome.

"32184417","abstracttext","Water deficit limits plant growth and productivity in wheat. The effect of water deficit varies considerably in the contrasting genotypes. This study attempted comparative transcriptome profiling of the tolerant (Abura) and susceptible (AUS12671) genotypes under PEG-simulated water stress via genome-wide RNA-seq technology to understand the dynamics of tolerance mechanism. Morphological and physiological analyses indicated that the tolerant genotype Abura had a higher root growth and net photosynthesis, which accounted for its higher root biomass than AUS12671 under stress. Transcriptomic analysis revealed a total of 924 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that were unique in the contrasting genotypes under stress across time points. The susceptible genotype AUS12671 had slightly more abundant DEGs (505) than the tolerant genotype Abura (419). Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses of these DEGs suggested that the two genotypes differed significantly in terms of adaptive mechanism. Predominant upregulation of genes involved in various metabolic pathways was the key adaptive feature of the susceptive genotype AUS12671 indicating its energy-consuming approach in adaptation to water deficit. In contrast, downregulation the expression of genes of key pathways, such as global and overview maps, carbohydrate metabolism, and genetic information processing was the main strategy for the tolerant genotype Abura. Besides, significantly higher number of genes encoding transcription factors (TF) families like MYB and NAC, which were reported to be associated with stress defense, were differentially expressed in the tolerant genotype Abura. Gene encoding transcription factors TIFY were only differentially expressed between stressed and non-stressed conditions in the sensitive genotype. The identified DEGs and the suggested differential adaptive strategies of the contrasting genotypes provided an insight for improving water deficit tolerance in wheat."

"32181055","abstracttext","The D genome progenitor of bread wheat, Aegilops tauschii Cosson (DD, 2n = 2x = 14), which is naturally distributed in Central Eurasia, ranging from northern Syria and Turkey to western China, is considered a potential genetic resource for improving bread wheat. In this study, the chloroplast (cp) genomes of 17 Ae. tauschii accessions were reconstructed. The cp genome sizes ranged from 135,551 bp to 136,009 bp and contained a typical quadripartite structure of angiosperms. Within these genomes, we identified a total of 124 functional genes, including 82 protein-coding genes, 34 transfer RNA genes and eight ribosomal RNA genes, with 17 duplicated genes in the IRs. Although the comparative analysis revealed that the genomic structure (gene order, gene number and IR/SC boundary regions) is conserved, a few variant loci were detected, predominantly in the non-coding regions (intergenic spacer regions). The phylogenetic relationships determined based on the complete genome sequences were consistent with the hypothesis that Ae. tauschii populations in the Yellow River region of China originated in South Asia not Xinjiang province or Iran, which could contribute to more effective utilization of wild germplasm resources. Furthermore, we confirmed that Ae . tauschii was derived from monophyletic speciation rather than hybrid speciation at the cp genome level. We also identified four variable genomic regions, rpl32 - trnL-UAG , ccsA - ndhD , rbcL - psaI and rps18 - rpl20 , showing high levels of nucleotide polymorphisms, which may accordingly prove useful as cpDNA markers in studying the intraspecific genetic structure and diversity of Ae. tauschii."

Resistance to Pst is often overcome by pathogen virulence changes, but the mechanisms of variation are not clearly understood. To determine the role of mutation in Pst virulence changes, in previous studies 30 mutant isolates were developed from a least virulent isolate using ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis and phenotyped for virulence changes. The progenitor isolate was sequenced, assembled and annotated for establishing a high-quality reference genome. In the present study, the 30 mutant isolates were sequenced and compared to the wide-type isolate to determine the genomic variation and identify candidates for avirulence (Avr) genes."

"32249495","abstracttext","Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in plant development and stress responses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation. It is not clear how lncRNA-mediated plant responses to cold stress and how lncRNAs, miRNAs and target mRNAs cooperate subject to the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). We interpreted the function of lncRNAs in the winter wheat cultivar Dongnongdongmai 1 (Dn1). A total of 9970 putative lncRNAs were initially identified from three Dn1 lncRNA libraries (5 °C, -10 °C and -25 °C) using high-throughput sequencing. Among the 14,626 genes detected via weighted gene co-expression network analysis, 7435 lncRNAs were co-expressed with 7191 mRNAs. We found six modules related to cold resistance in the lncRNA-mRNA weighted co-expression network, and the functions of mRNAs were similar in each module. Antioxidant systems and hormones played important roles in low-temperature responses. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that interactions between the 384 lncRNAs and 70 miRNAs were required for ceRNA activity. According to ceRNA activity, 225 lncRNAs, 60 miRNAs and 621 target mRNAs were involved in the regulatory networks of the cold stress response. Notably, a conserved region was found in the complementary regions of lncRNAs and miR164/408 but had reverse expression trends in the ceRNA network. Our results reveal possible roles of lncRNAs-mRNAs in the regulatory networks associated with tolerance to low temperature and provide useful information for more strategic use of genomic resources in wheat breeding."

"30254653","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), the causal agent of stripe rust, is an obligate biotrophic pathogen responsible for severe wheat disease epidemics worldwide. Pst and other rust fungi are acknowledged to deliver many effector proteins to the host, but little is known about the effectors' functions. Here, we report a candidate effector Pst_8713 isolated based on the genome data of CY32 and the expression of Pst_8713 is highly induced during the early infection stage. The Pst_8713 gene shows a low level of intra-species polymorphism. It has a functional N-terminal signal peptide and its product was found in the host cytoplasm and nucleus. Co-infiltrations in Nicotiana benthamiana demonsrated that Pst_8713 was capable of suppressing cell death triggered by mouse pro-apoptotic protein-BAX or Phytophthora infestans PAMP-INF1. Overexpression of Pst_8713 in plants suppressed pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) -associated callose deposition and expression of PTI-associated marker genes and promoted bacterial growth in planta . Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) induced by an avirulent Pst isolate was weakened when we overexpressed Pst_8713 in wheat leaves which accompanied by reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and hypersensitive response (HR). In addition, the host induced gene silencing (HIGS) experiment showed that knockdown of Pst_8713 weakened the virulence of Pst by producing fewer uredinia. These results indicated that candidate effector Pst_8713 is involved in plant defense suppression and contributes to enhancing the Pst virulence."

"30233510","abstracttext","Low phosphorus soils are thought to constitute the majority of soils worldwide and cannot support intensive agriculture without high fertilizer inputs. Rhizobacteria are well-known to modify P dynamics and an increased bacterial diversity normally has a positive impact on various process rates. However, it is not known how variation in bacterial diversity at the subspecies level could influence trophic interactions in the rhizosphere and its consequences on plant P nutrition. We therefore hypothesized that the interactions between closely related P solubilizing bacteria and their grazing nematodes could improve plant P dynamics from an unavailable P source. We isolated four Pseudomonas poae strains and extracted nematodes from a Saskatchewan wheat field soil sample. The potential of all bacterial isolates with and without nematodes for increasing P availability in the wheat rhizosphere was tested in controlled microcosms with Ca 3 (PO 4 ) 2 as sole P source. Liberated P, phosphatase activity, plant P and bacterial abundance based on phnX gene copies were determined. Phosphorus solubilization efficiency of isolates varied between isolates whereas phosphatase enzyme activity was only detected under nematodes grazing and during the first 15 days of the experiment. Nematodes grazing upon individual Pseudomonas poae increased phosphatase enzyme activity, bacterial abundance, but decreased plant P concentration compared to non-grazed system. In contrast, the treatment combining all Pseudomonas poae isolates together with nematodes resulted in significant increases in P availability and plant P concentration. Diverse P-solubilizing efficiency and interaction with nematodes within the same bacterial ""species"" suggest that P dynamics might be linked to micro variation in soil diversity that would not accurately be picked up using common tools such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing."

"30465882","abstracttext","The virally encoded KP4 killer toxin protein was first identified from Ustilago maydis (Um), and its homologues are present in diverse fungi and in one species of moss. No KP4-like (KP4L) proteins have been functionally characterized. Here, we report the identification and functional analysis of four KP4L proteins from Fusarium graminearum (Fg), the primary causal pathogen of Fusarium head blight (FHB), which is also known to associate with seedling rot of wheat. The four FgKP4L proteins (FgKP4L-1, -2, -3 and -4) are encoded by small open reading frames (378-825 bp) located on chromosome 1 with the FgKP4L-1, -2 and -3 genes clustering together. Sequence analysis indicated that FgKP4L proteins have conserved domains predicted to form a three-dimensional alpha/beta-sandwich structure as first reported for UmKP4, with FgKP4L-4 featuring double Kp4 domains. Further analyses revealed that the FgKP4L genes are expressed in vitro under certain stress conditions, and all up-regulated during FHB and/or seedling rot development, the recombinant FgKP4L-2 protein does not induce cell death in wheat leaves or spikelets, but inhibits root growth of young seedlings, and the elimination of the FgKP4L-1/-2/-3 gene cluster from the fungal genome results in reduced virulence in seedling rot but not in FHB. Database searches revealed KP4L proteins from ∼80 fungal species with more than half from human/animal pathogens. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that UmKP4 and the moss KP4L proteins are closely related to those from a zygromycete and Aspergillus, respectively, implying cross-kingdom horizontal gene transfer."

"30405543","abstracttext","The continuous use of nitrogen (N) fertilizers to increase soil fertility and crop productivity often results in unexpected environmental effects and N losses through biological processes, such as nitrification and denitrification. In this study, multidisciplinary approaches were employed to assess the effects of N fertilization in a long-term (~20 years) field experiment in which a fertilizer gradient (0, 200, 400, and 600 kg N ha -1 yr -1 ) was applied in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation cropping system in the North China Plain, one of the most intensive agricultural regions in China. The potential nitrification/denitrification rates, bacterial community structure, and abundances of functional microbial communities involved in key processes of the N cycle were assessed during both the summer maize (SM) and winter wheat (WW) seasons. Long-term N fertilization resulted in a decrease in soil pH and an increase in soil organic matter (OM), total N and total carbon concentrations. Potential nitrification/denitrification and the abundances of corresponding functional N cycling genes were positively correlated with the fertilization intensity. High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the increased fertilization intensity caused a significant decrease of bacterial diversity in SM season, while changed the microbial community composition such as increasing the Bacteroidetes abundance and decreasing Acidobacteria abundance in both SM and WW seasons. The alteration of soil properties markedly correlated with the variation in microbial structure, as soil pH and OM were the most predominant factors affecting the microbial structure in the SM and WW seasons, respectively. Furthermore, consistently with the results of functional gene quantification, functional prediction of microbial communities based on 16S rRNA sequence data also revealed that the abundances of the key nitrificaiton/denitrification groups were elevated by long-term N inputs. Taken together, our results suggested that soil microbial community shifted consistently in both SM and WW seasons toward a higher proportion of N-cycle microbes and exhibited higher N turnover activities in response to long-term elevated N fertilizer. These findings provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms responsible for N loss in intensively N fertilized agricultural ecosystems."

"30598989","abstracttext","The centromeres perform integral control of the cell division process and proper distribution of chromosomes into daughter cells. The correct course of this process is often disrupted in case of remote hybridization, which is a stress factor. The combination of parental genomes of different species in a hybrid cell leads to a ""genomic shock"" followed by loss of genes, changes in gene expression, deletions, inversions, and translocations of chromosome regions. The created rye-wheat allopolyploid hybrids, which were collectively called secalotriticum, represent a new interesting model for studying the effect of remote hybridization on the centromere and its components. The main feature of an active centromere is the presence of a specific histone H3 modification in the centromeric nucleosomes, which is referred to as CENH3 in plants. In this paper the results of cytogenetic analysis of the secalotriticum hybrid karyotypes and the comparison of the CENH3 N-terminal domain structure of parent and hybrid forms are presented. It is shown that the karyotypes of the created secalotriticum forms are stable balanced hexaploids not containing minichromosomes with deleted arms, in full or in part. A high level of homology between rye and wheat enables to express both parental forms of CENH3 gene in the hybrid genomes of secalotriticum cultivars. The CENH3 structure in hybrids in each crossing combination has some specific features. The percentage of polymorphisms at several amino acid positions is much higher in one of the secalotriticum hybrids, STr VD, than in parental forms, whereas the other hybrid, STr VM, inherits a high level of amino acid substitutions at the position 25 from the maternal parent."

Carbendazim has been extensively used for controlling FHB for more than 30 years, leading to the widespread carbendazim-resistant isolates in all major wheat-producing provinces in China, especially in Anhui Province. F. asiaticum isolates were collected throughout Anhui Province between 2010 and 2012 to monitor their sensitivity to carbendazim. In total, 74 of 899 single-spore isolates F. asiaticum were found to be resistant to carbendazim. Resistant isolates were collected from all of the sampled sites except Hefei of Anhui Province. The overall frequency of carbendazim resistance was shown to be 8.2%. Of the 74 isolates, 1, 68, and 5 had low resistance (LR), moderate resistance (MR) ,and high resistance (HR), respectively, to carbendazim. Five types of point mutations (F167Y, E198L, E198K, F200Y, and E198Q) in the β 2 -tubulin gene conferring resistance to carbendazim were detected in the field-resistant isolates with frequencies of 89.2, 2.7, 4.1, 2.7, and 1.4%, respectively. The point mutations at codon 167, 198, or 200 of the β 2 -tubulin gene were correlated with different levels of carbendazim resistance. Some of the sensitive and resistant isolates appeared to possess different biological characteristics; however, these might not be due to resistance. Because carbendazim resistance was generally widespread throughout Anhui Province, the sensitivity of F. asiaticum populations to carbendazim should be constantly monitored for the development of carbendazim resistance in natural populations."

HD2329 and its resistant (R) near isogenic line (NIL) (HD2329+Lr28) using two approaches: methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism (MSAP) and methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP). S/R lines each had a large number of hypomethylated genes and relatively fewer hypermethylated genes at 96 hai (hours after inoculation) relative to 0 hbi (hours before inoculation), suggesting activation of many genes during the passage of time (96 hai), although identity of genes may differ in S and R lines. When R NIL was compared with S cultivar, there were many hypermethylated and fewer hypomethylated genes in R NIL relative to S cultivar, suggesting that many genes that are active in S cultivar are silenced in R NIL, both at 0 hbi and at 96 hai. Level of methylation was generally abundant in intergenic regions followed by that in promoters, transcription termination sites (TTSs) and exons/introns. Hypermethylation in promoter and gene body regions was not always associated with inhibition of gene expression and vice-versa, indicating that more than one regulatory mechanisms may control the expression of genes due to pathogen attack in presence and absence of Lr28. MSAP analysis also showed abundance of m CG methylation in S cultivar and that of m CCG methylation in R NIL (at 96 hai), suggesting differences in methylation context in NILs with and without Lr28.

"31241341","articletitle","Metabolic Changes of Fusarium graminearum Induced by TPS Gene Deletion."
"31241341","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) mainly resulting from Fusarium graminearum ( Fg ) Schwabe is a notorious wheat disease causing huge losses in wheat production globally. Fg also produces mycotoxins, which are harmful to human and domestic animals. In our previous study, we obtained two Fg mutants, TPS1 - and TPS2 - , respectively, with a single deletion of trehalose 6-phosphate synthase ( TPS1 ) and trehalose 6-phosphate phosphatase ( TPS2 ) compared with the wild type (WT). Both mutants were unable to synthesize trehalose and produced fewer mycotoxins. To understand the other biochemical changes induced by TPS gene deletion in Fg , we comprehensively analyzed the metabolomic differences between TPS - mutants and the WT using NMR together with gas chromatography-flame ionization detection/mass spectrometry. The expression of some relevant genes was also quantified. The results showed that TPS1 - and TPS2 - mutants shared some common metabolic feature such as decreased levels for trehalose, Val, Thr, Lys, Asp, His, Trp, malonate, citrate, uridine, guanosine, inosine, AMP, C10:0, and C16:1 compared with the WT. Both mutants also shared some common expressional patterns for most of the relevant genes. This suggests that apart from the reduced trehalose biosynthesis, both TPS1 and TPS2 have roles in inhibiting glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle but promoting the phosphopentose pathway and nucleotide synthesis; the depletion of either TPS gene reduces the acetyl-CoA-mediated mycotoxin biosynthesis. TPS2 - mutants produced more fatty acids than TPS1 - mutants, suggesting different roles for TPS1 and TPS2 , with TPS2 - mutants having impaired trehalose biosynthesis and trehalose 6-phosphate accumulation. This may offer opportunities for developing new fungicides targeting trehalose biosynthesis in Fg for FHB control and mycotoxin reduction in the FHB-affected cereals."

"31290924","abstracttext","Russian wheat aphid (RWA) ( Kurdjumov) is a serious invasive pest of small-grain cereals and many grass species. An efficient strategy to defy aphid attacks is to identify sources of natural resistance and transfer resistance genes into susceptible crop cultivars. Revealing the genes helps understand plant defense mechanisms and engineer plants with durable resistance to the pest. To date, more than 15 RWA resistance genes have been identified in wheat ( L.) but none of them has been cloned. Previously, we genetically mapped the RWA resistance gene into an interval of 0.83 cM on the short arm of chromosome 7D and spanned it with five bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones. Here, we used a targeted strategy combining traditional approaches toward gene cloning (genetic mapping and sequencing of BAC clones) with novel technologies, including optical mapping and long-read nanopore sequencing. The latter, with reads spanning the entire length of a BAC insert, enabled us to assemble the whole region, a task that was not achievable with short reads. Long-read optical mapping validated the DNA sequence in the interval and revealed a difference in the locus organization between resistant and susceptible genotypes. The complete and accurate sequence of the region facilitated the identification of new markers and precise annotation of the interval, revealing six high-confidence genes. Identification of as the most likely candidate opens an avenue for its validation through functional genomics approaches."

"31279220","abstracttext","Low temperature is one of the primary causes of economic loss in agricultural production, and in this regard, expansin proteins are known to play important roles in plant growth and responses to various abiotic stresses and plant hormones. In order to elucidate the roles of expansin genes in the response of Dongnongdongmai 2 (D2), a highly cold-resistant winter wheat variety, to low-temperature stress, we exposed plants to a temperature of 4℃ and analysed the transcriptome of tillering nodes. Expression levels of TaEXPB7-B were significantly increased in response to both low-temperature stress and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. To further confirm these observations, we transformed Arabidopsis plants with the β-glucuronidase (GUS) gene driven by the TaEXPB7-B promoter. GUS staining results revealed that TaEXPB7-B showed similar responses to low-temperature and ABA treatments. Our transcriptome data indicated that the AREB/ABF transcription factor gene TaWABI5 was also induced by low temperature in D2. Yeast one-hybrid experiments demonstrated that TaWABI5 binds to an ABRE cis-element in the TaEXPB7-B promoter, and overexpression of TaWABI5 in wheat protoplasts enhanced the expression of endogenous TaEXPB7-B by 7.7-fold, implying that TaWABI5 plays important roles in regulating the expression of TaEXPB7-B. Cytological data obtained from the transient expression of 35S::TaEXPB7-B-eYFP in onion epidermal cells indicated that TaEXPB7-B is cell wall localised. Overexpression of TaEXPB7-B in Arabidopsis promoted a significant increase in plant growth and increased lignin and cellulose contents. Moreover, TaEXPB7-B conferred enhanced antioxidant and osmotic regulation in transgenic Arabidopsis, thereby increasing the tolerance and survival of plants under conditions of low-temperature stress."

Functional enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs related to immunity, growth and reproduction in vector aphids were higher than those in non-vector aphids, and the differentially expressed genes related to immune were up-regulated. This study provides a basis for the evaluation of the response mechanisms of vector/non-vector insects to plant viruses."

"32866164","abstracttext_methods and findings","42 data sets including PRJNA380841 and PRJNA369686 were used to construct the co-expression network through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). A total of 1,896,897,901 (284.30 Gb) clean reads and 35,021 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained from 42 samples. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that photosynthesis, DNA replication, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, arginine and proline metabolism, and cell cycle were significantly influenced by drought stress. Furthermore, the DEGs with similar expression patterns, detected by K-means clustering, were grouped into 29 clusters. Genes involved in the modules, such as dark turquoise, yellow, and brown, were found to be appreciably linked with drought resistance. Twelve central, greatly correlated genes in stage-specific modules were subsequently confirmed and validated at the transcription levels, including TraesCS7D01G417600.1 (PP2C), TraesCS5B01G565300.1 (ERF), TraesCS4A01G068200.1 (HSP), TraesCS2D01G033200.1 (HSP90), TraesCS6B01G425300.1 (RBD), TraesCS7A01G499200.1 (P450), TraesCS4A01G118400.1 (MYB), TraesCS2B01G415500.1 (STK), TraesCS1A01G129300.1 (MYB), TraesCS2D01G326900.1 (ALDH), TraesCS3D01G227400.1 (WRKY), and TraesCS3B01G144800.1 (GT)."
"32866164","abstracttext_conclusions","Analyzing the response of wheat to drought stress during different growth stages, we have detected three modules and 12 hub genes that are associated with drought resistance mechanisms, and five of those genes are newly identified for drought resistance. The references provided by these modules will promote the understanding of the drought-resistance mechanism. In addition, the candidate genes can be used as a basis of transgenic or molecular marker-assisted selection for improving the drought resistance and increasing the yields of wheat."

"33193686","abstracttext","With the expansion of the aquaculture industry in the last two decades, there has been a large increase in the use of plant ingredients in aquafeeds, which has created new challenges in fish growth, health and welfare. Fish muscle growth is an important trait that is strongly affected by diet, but our knowledge on the effect of plant protein-based diets on global gene expression in muscle is still scant. The present study evaluated nutrigenomic effects of the inclusion of proteins from pea, soy and wheat into aquafeeds, compared to a control diet with fishmeal as the main protein source using the zebrafish model by RNA-seq; these results were extended to an important aquaculture species by analyzing selected differentially expressed genes identified in the zebrafish model on on-growing Atlantic salmon fed with equivalent plant protein-based diets. Expression of selected Atlantic salmon paralogues of the zebrafish homologs was analyzed using paralogue-specific qPCR assays. Global gene expression changes in muscle of zebrafish fed with plant-based diets were moderate, with the highest changes observed in the soy diet-fed fish, and no change for the pea diet-fed fish compared to the control diet. Among the differentially expressed genes were mylpfb , hsp90aa1.1 , col2a1a , and odc1 , which are important in regulating muscle growth, maintaining muscle structure and function, and muscle tissue homeostasis. Furthermore, those genes and their paralogues were differentially expressed in Atlantic salmon fed with the equivalent percentage of soy or wheat protein containing diets. Some of these genes were similarly regulated in both species while others showed species-specific regulation. The present study expands our understanding on the molecular effects of plant ingredients in fish muscle. Ultimately, the knowledge gained would be of importance for the improved formulation of sustainable plant-based diets for the aquaculture industry."
"18052884","articletitle","Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) attack causes a dramatic shift in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in wheat."
"18052884","abstracttext","Carbon and nitrogen (C/N) metabolism and allocation within the plant have important implications for plant-parasite interactions. Many plant parasites manipulate the host by inducing C/N changes that benefit their own survival and growth. Plant resistance can prevent this parasite manipulation. We used the wheat-Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) system to analyze C/N changes in plants during compatible and incompatible interactions. The Hessian fly is an insect but shares many features with plant pathogens, being sessile during feeding stages and having avirulence (Avr) genes that match plant resistance genes in gene-for-gene relationships. Many wheat genes involved in C/N metabolism were differentially regulated in plants during compatible and incompatible interactions. In plants during compatible interactions, the content of free carbon-containing compounds decreased 36%, whereas the content of free nitrogen-containing compounds increased 46%. This C/N shift was likely achieved through a coordinated regulation of genes in a number of central metabolic pathways, including glycolysis, the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and amino-acid synthesis. Our data on plants during compatible interactions support recent findings that Hessian fly larvae create nutritive cells at feeding (attack) sites and manipulate host plants to enhance their own survival and growth. In plants during incompatible interactions, most of the metabolic genes examined were not affected or down-regulated."
"17185737","articletitle","Drought-adaptive traits derived from wheat wild relatives and landraces."
"17185737","abstracttext","Exotic parents are being used to increase allelic diversity in bread wheat breeding through (i) interspecific hybridization of the ancestral genomes to produce so-called synthetic derived (SYN-DER) wheat, and (ii) crossing with landrace accessions, originating in abiotically stressed environments, that have become isolated from mainstream gene pools. Evaluation of the inherent genetic diversity encompassed by drought-adapted landraces compared with checks using DNA fingerprinting confirmed that some landraces were not only distant from checks but also showed significant diversity among each other. Improvement in performance of SYN-DER lines compared with recurrent parents was not associated with a larger overall investment in root dry weight, but rather an increased partitioning of root mass to deeper soil profiles (between 60 cm and 120 cm) and increased ability to extract moisture from those depths. The best Mexican landraces showed superior ability in terms of water extraction from soil depth, as well as increased concentration of soluble carbohydrates in the stem shortly after anthesis. Although it can be argued that inferring theoretical yield gains from the over-expression of any of these traits is questionable, since compensatory mechanisms may be at work, the fact remains that mechanistic or genetic linkages among physiological traits remain largely un-established. In the meantime, trait information is being used to make strategic crosses based on the theoretical combination of useful stress-adaptive traits with the possibility of realizing additive gene action in selected progeny. Candidates for crossing with elite check cultivars include landraces identified that showed relatively high biomass under drought combined with favourable expression of physiological traits such as stem carbohydrates, water extraction characteristics, and transpiration efficiency."
"19513687","articletitle","A quantitative genetic study for elucidating the contribution of glutamine synthetase, glutamate dehydrogenase and other nitrogen-related physiological traits to the agronomic performance of common wheat."
"19513687","abstracttext","To better understand the genetic variability for nitrogen use efficiency in winter wheat is a necessity in the frame of the present economic and ecological context. The objective of this work was to investigate the role of the enzymes glutamine synthetase (GS) and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), and other nitrogen (N)-related physiological traits in the control of agronomic performance in wheat. A quantitative genetics approach was developed using the Arche x Récital population of doubled haploid lines grown for 3 years in the field. GS and GDH activities, ammonium, amino acid and protein contents were measured at different stages of plant development in different organs after flowering. Significant genotypic effects were observed for all measured physiological and agronomical traits. Heading date was negatively correlated with ammonium, amino acid, protein contents and GS activity in the flag leaf lamina. Grain protein content was positively correlated with both ammonium and amino acid content, and to a lesser extent with soluble protein content and GS activity. A total of 148 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected, 104 QTLs for physiological traits and 44 QTLs for agronomic traits. Twenty-six QTLs were detected for GDH activity spread over 13 chromosomes and 25 QTLs for GS activity spread over 12 chromosomes. We found only a co-localization between a QTL for GS activity and GSe, a structural gene encoding cytosolic GS on chromosome 4B. A coincidence between a QTL for GDH activity and a gene encoding GDH was also found on chromosome 2B. QTL regions combining both physiological and agronomical QTLs were mainly identified on linkage groups 2A, 2B, 2D, 5A, 5B and 5D. This approach allowed us to propose possible functions of physiological traits to explain the variation observed for agronomic traits including yield and its components."

"19401421","abstracttext_results","Of 42 patients, 20 displayed increased CD3(+) T-cell proliferation to WPs and were classified as responders; proliferative responses to other dietary antigens were less pronounced. WP-stimulated PBMNCs from patients showed a mixed proinflammatory cytokine response with large amounts of IFN-gamma, IL-17A, and increased TNF. HLA-DQ2, the major celiac disease risk gene, was not significantly different. Nearly all responders carried the diabetes risk gene HLA-DR4. Anti-DR antibodies blocked the WP response and inhibited secretion of Th1 and Th17 cytokines. High amounts of WP-stimulated IL-6 were not blocked."

"25056774","abstracttext","In this study, TaTEF-7A, a member of the transcript elongation factor gene family, and its ﬂanking sequences were isolated. TaTEF-7A was located on chromosome 7A and was ﬂanked by markers Xwmc83 and XP3156.3. Subcellular localization revealed that TaTEF-7A protein was localized in the nucleus. This gene was expressed in all organs, but the highest expression occurred in young spikes and developing seeds. Overexpression of TaTEF-7A in Arabidopsis thaliana produced pleiotropic effects on vegetative and reproductive development that enhanced grain length, silique number, and silique length. No diversity was found in the coding region of TaTEF-7A, but 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms and Indels were detected in the promoter regions of different cultivars. Markers based on sequence variations in the promoter regions (InDel-629 and InDel-604) were developed, and three haplotypes were identified based on those markers. Haplotype-trait association analysis of the Chinese wheat mini core collection revealed that TaTEF-7A was significantly associated with grain number per spike. Phenotyping of near-isogenic lines (NILs) confirmed that TaTEF-7A increases potential grain yield and yield-related traits. Frequency changes in favoured haplotypes gradually increased in cultivars released in China from the 1940s. Geographic distributions of favoured haplotypes were characterized in six major wheat production regions worldwide. The presence of Hap-7A-3, the favoured haplotype, showed a positive correlation with yield in a global set of breeding lines. These results suggest that TaTEF-7A is a functional regulatory factor for grain number per spike and provide a basis for marker-assisted selection."

"32016554","abstracttext_key message","Three pleiotropic QTL regions associated with spikelet number and heading date were identified, with FT-A1 considered the candidate gene for QTspn/Hd.cau-7A. Spikelet number traits and heading date (HD) play key roles in yield improvement of wheat and its wide adaptation to different environments. Here, we used a Recombinant Inbred Lines population derived from a cross between Yi5029 (5029) and Nongda4332 (4332) to construct a high-density genetic linkage map and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with total spikelet number per spike (TSPN), fertile spikelet number per spike (FSPN), sterile spikelet number per spike (SSPN) and HD. A total of 22 environmentally stable QTL for TSPN, FSPN, SSPN and HD were identified. Notably, three pleiotropic QTL regions for TSPN and HD were detected on chromosomes 2A, 7A and 7D. The QTL associated with TSPN and HD on chromosome 7AS was designated QTspn/Hd.cau-7A. Furthermore, the candidate gene FT-A1 located in the region of QTspn/Hd.cau-7A had a single-nucleotide polymorphism (T-G) within the third exon, which might be the cause of diversity in spikelet number and HD between the two parents. Additionally, we developed a semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR (STARP) marker to analyze the geographical distribution and evolution of FT-A1 (T or G) alleles. This study contributes to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the four traits (TSPN, FSPN, SSPN and HD) and provides further insights into the genetic relationship between spikelet number traits and HD in wheat."

"32114414","abstracttext","Heat shock transcription factors (Hsfs) play an important role in regulating heat stress response in plants. Our previous study found that there were 82 non-redundant Hsfs in wheat, 18 of which belonged to subclass A2. In this study, we cloned an A2 member, TaHsfA2-1, which encoded a protein of 346 amino acid residues in wheat. The fusion protein TaHsfA2-1-GFP was localized in the nucleus under normal growth conditions. TaHsfA2-1 was expressed in nearly all the measured tissues, most highly in mature leaves. The expression level of TaHsfA2-1 can be enhanced by heat stress, PEG stress, and signal molecules such as H 2 O 2 and SA. Yeast cells transformed with TaHsfA2-1 improved thermotolerance compared to those with the empty vector. TaHsfA2-1-overexpressing Arabidopsis displayed a better growth state with more green leaves than wild-type seedlings after heat stress. Accordingly, the chlorophyll content and survival rate in the transgenic lines were higher than in the wild type, and relative conductivity in the transgenic lines was lower than in the wild type. Further research found that TaHsfA2-1-overexpressing Arabidopsis up-regulated the expression of some heat shock protein genes (Hsps) compared to wild type after heat stress. These results suggested that TaHsfA2-1 is a new gene that improves thermotolerance in plants by mediating the expression of Hsps. A functional gene was provided for molecular breeding in the subsequent research."

"32825128","abstracttext","Wheat powdery mildew (Pm), caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ), is a prevalent fungal disease. The diploid wheat relative Haynaldia villosa ( H. villosa ) showed broad-spectrum resistance (BSR) to Pm. A previous study reported an E3 ligase gene, CMPG1-V from H. villosa , showing BSR to Pm. To elucidate the regulatory network mediated by CMPG1-V , in this study, gene expression profiling of CMPG1-V transgenic plant ( CMPG1-V OE ) and its receptor Yangmai 158 was analyzed and compared after Bgt inoculation at four infection stages. GO and KEGG analysis revealed obvious reprogramming of SA and ABA signaling, starch/sucrose metabolism, and photosynthesis in CMPG1-V OE , compared with those in Yangmai 158. Transcripts of SA synthesis genes SARD1 and UGT , signaling factors TGA and PRs , and SnRKs in ABA signaling were specifically upregulated in CMPG1-V OE rather than Yangmai 158. Transcripts of LHCII in photosynthesis, GLUC and TPP in starch/sucrose metabolism were also induced distinctly in CMPG1-V OE . WGCNA analysis showed crucial regulatory candidates of CMPG1-V , involving serine/threonine-protein kinase in phosphorylation, glucosyltransferase in flavonoid biosynthesis, defense factor WRKYs, and peroxidase in oxidative stress. Our results facilitate the deciphering of the resistant regulatory network of CMPG1-V and the identification of key candidates which might be employed in breeding programs."
"30731902","articletitle","First Report of Fusarium cerealis Causing Fusarium Head Blight on Barley in China."
"30731902","abstracttext","The fungus Fusarium cerealis (Cooke) Sacc. (1886) (synonym F. crookwellense L.W. Burgess, P.E. Nelson et Toussoun (1982)) is one of the causal agents of Fusarium head blight (FHB), a significant fungal disease of small grains and maize in many countries (3). Miller et al. identified trichothecene chemotypes from three F. cerealis (F. crookwellense) strains collected from Chinese wheat in 1991 (2). However, there have been no other reports of this Fusarium species in China since then. The disease has been an important threat to the production of wheat and barley in China, and has caused yield losses of approximately 212,000 t (data from China National Agro-Technical Extension and Service Center) in 2008, one of the most severe FHB epidemic years in Chinese wheat in the past 10 years. Scabby heads of barley and wheat were collected from Yuxi and Zhaotong in Yunnan Province, respectively, in 2008. Each of 15 strains was isolated from a different spike of barley and eight isolates were derived from different wheat spikes. All strains were single spored. On the basis of a multilocus genotyping assay (4), all 15 isolates from barley and six of the eight strains from wheat were identified as F. cerealis with the nivalenol (NIV) genotype. To validate this result, partial translation elongation factor (TEF-1α, ~700 bp) gene sequences of isolates were generated (GenBank Accession Nos. HQ824369 and HQ824370) and then compared with the FUSARIUM-ID database (1). The TEF-1α sequences of all 21 isolates were highly conserved and showed 100% identity with the sequences of F. cerealis in the database. A pathogenicity test was performed on a winter wheat cultivar, Yangmai158, using a three-replicate randomized complete block design in Langfang Experimental Farm. Langfang is not an FHB-endemic area and is very dry, with almost no infection source in normal years. At anthesis, the central floret of each of five spikes was injected with 20 μl of a conidial suspension (10 6 macroconidia/ml) of each isolate in each block, such that 105 spikes were injected per block. An equal amount of water was injected into five heads in each block as a control. The inoculated spikes were enclosed in sandwich bags misted with water for 3 days to ensure infection by the inoculated pathogen and prevent infections from other sources. The plots were misted twice daily after inoculation. The average night and day temperatures were 19.0 and 25.2°C, respectively. Typical FHB symptoms (light tan or bleached spikelets, bases of infected spikelets, and portions of the rachis were dark brown), which were observed in the heads inoculated with F. cerealis 7 days after inoculation, were similar to the original symptoms in the sampling sites. The control plants remained asymptomatic. F. cerealis was reisolated from the infected heads, indicating it was the pathogen causing this disease. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. cerealis causing FHB on barley in China, and also the first time that a high proportion of F. cerealis strains were isolated from one sampling site (15 of 15 in Yuxi and 6 of 8 in Zhaotong). More isolates must be collected in Yunnan Province and further studies conducted to gain a better understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of this pathogen. References: (1) D. M.

"19132073","abstracttext","To map important ESTs to specific chromosomes and (or) chromosomal regions is difficult in hexaploid wheat because of its large genome size and serious interference of homoeologous sequences. Large-scale EST sequencing and subsequent chromosome localization are both laborious and time-consuming. The wheat alien addition line TAi-27 contains a pair of chromosomes of Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey that carry the resistance gene against barley yellow dwarf virus. In this research, we developed a modified technique based on chromosome microdissection and hybridization-specific amplification to isolate expressed sequences from the alien chromosome of TAi-27 by hybridization between the DNA of the microdissected alien chromosome and cDNA of Th. intermedium infected by barley yellow dwarf virus. Twelve clones were selected, sequenced, and analyzed. Three of them were unknown genes without any hit in the GenBank database and the other nine were highly homologous with ESTs of wheat, barley, and (or) other plants in Gramineae induced by abiotic or biotic stress. The method used in this research to isolate expressed sequences from a specific chromosome has the following advantages: (i) the obtained expressed sequences are larger in size and have 3' end information and (ii) the operation is less complicated. It would be an efficient improved method for genomics and functional genomics research of polyploid plants, especially for EST development and mapping. The obtained expressed sequence data are also informative in understanding the resistance genes on the alien chromosome of TAi-27."

"19143227","abstracttext","The effects of insoluble dietary fibre differing in lignin content on intestinal morphology and mRNA expression was tested in an animal model of 48 weaned piglets. Engaged fibre sources were wheat bran (rich in cellulose and hemicellulose) and pollen from Chinese Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) (rich in lignin), respectively. The fibre sources were added to a basal diet as follows: no addition (control), 3.0% wheat bran, 1.27% pine pollen, and 2.55% pine pollen. The 12 animals of each feeding group were fed four experimental diets ad libitum for 37 days and were then slaughtered for retrieving tissue samples from stomach, jejunum, ileum, colon and mesenterial lymph nodes. Both fibre sources increased villus height of mucosa in jejunum (+10% on average) and ileum (+16% on average). Results of mRNA expression rates of inflammatory, cell cycle and growth marker genes (NFkappaB, TNFalpha, TGFbeta, Caspase3, CDK4, IGF1) were specific to fibre source and tissue: wheat bran induced an up-regulation of NFkappaB in stomach and jejunum, as well as TNFalpha and TGFbeta, and Caspase3 in jejunum. Pine pollen induced down regulation of NFkappaB, TNFalpha, TGFbeta, Caspase3, CDK4 and IGF1 in the colon as well as up-regulation of NFkappaB and TGFbeta in mesenterial lymph nodes. Finally, an overall data comparison based on a hierarchical cluster analysis showed a close relation between gene regulation in different gut sections and organs, as well as between small intestine morphology and zootechnical performance."

"25500278","abstracttext","Fusarium equiseti is a toxigenic species that often contaminates cereal crops from diverse climatic regions such as Northern and Southern Europe. Previous results suggested the existence of two distinct populations within this species with differences in toxin profile which largely corresponded to North and South Europe (Spain). In this work, growth rate profiles of 4 F. equiseti strains isolated from different cereals and distinct Spanish regions were determined on wheat and barley based media at a range of temperatures (15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40°C) and water potential regimens (-0.7, -2.8, -7.0, and -9.8MPa, corresponding to 0.99, 0.98, 0.95 and 0.93 aw values). Growth was observed at all temperatures except at 40°C, and at all the solute potential values except at -9.8MPa when combined with 15°C. Optimal growth was observed at 20-30°C and -0.7/-2.8MPa. The effect of these factors on trichothecene biosynthesis was examined on a F. equiseti strain using a newly developed real time RT-PCR protocol to quantify TRI5 gene expression at 15, 25 and 35°C and -0.7, -2.8, -7.0 and -9.8MPa on wheat and barley based media. Induction of TRI5 expression was detected between 25 and 35°C and -0.7 and -2.8MPa, with maximum values at 35°C and -2.8MPa being higher in barley than in wheat medium. These results appeared to be consistent with a population well adapted to the present climatic conditions and predicted scenarios for Southern Europe and suggested some differences depending on the cereal considered. These are also discussed in relation to other Fusarium species co-occurring in cereals grown in this region and to their significance for prediction and control strategies of toxigenic risk in future scenarios of climate change for this region."

"25687296","abstracttext","Over the last decade, APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) proteins have become the subject of intensive research activity due to their involvement in a variety of biological processes. This research led to the identification of AP2/ERF genes in many species; however, little is known about these genes in durum wheat, one of the most important cereal crops in the world. In this study, a new member of the AP2/ERF transcription factor family, designated TdSHN1, was isolated from durum wheat using thermal asymetric interlaced PCR (TAIL-PCR) method. Protein sequence analysis showed that TdSHN1 contained an AP2/ERF domain of 63 amino acids and a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS). Phylogenetic analysis showed that TdSHN1 belongs to a group Va protein in the ERF subfamily which contains the Arabidopsis ERF proteins (SHN1, SHN2, and SHN3). Expression of TdSHN1 was strongly induced by salt, drought, abscisic acid (ABA), and cold. In planta, TdSHN1 protein was able to activate the transcription of GUS reporter gene driven by the GCC box and DRE element sequences. In addition, TdSHN1 was targeted to the nucleus when transiently expressed in tobacco epidermal cells. In transgenic yeast, overexpression of TdSHN1 increased tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses. Taken together, the results showed that TdSHN1 encodes an abiotic stress-inducible, transcription factor which confers abiotic stress tolerance in yeast. TdSHN1 is therefore a promising candidate for improvement of biotic and abiotic stress tolerance in wheat as well as other crops."

Moreover, the stamens of line C303A exhibit a high degree of pistillody, turning almost white. However, the molecular mechanism that underlies pistillody in C303A remains unclear. Therefore, to obtain a better understanding of pistillody in C303A, the phenotypic and cytological features of C303A were observed to identify the key stage for the homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures. Transcriptome profiles were determined for stamens using Illumina RNA sequencing."
"32019527","abstracttext_results","Morphological observations of the CMS wheat line with Aegilops crassa cytoplasm C303A showed that the pistils developed normally, but the stamens were ultimately aborted and they released no pollen when mature. According to paraffin section observations, the stamens began to transform into pistils or pistil-like structures in the binucleate stage (BNS). Therefore, the stamens were collected from line C303A and its maintainer 303B in the BNS for transcriptome sequencing. In total, 20,444 wheat genes were determined as differentially expressed in C303A and 303B stamens, with 10,283 upregulated and 10,161 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology enrichment analyses showed that most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were annotated with GO terms comprising metabolic process, cell, cellular process, catalytic activity, and cell part. Analysis based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database showed that the enriched DEGs were mainly associated with energy metabolism. We also found several essential genes that may contribute to pistillody in C303A. These findings suggest that disrupted energy metabolism and reactive oxygen metabolism induce pistillody and eventually lead to abortion in C303A."

"2499688","articletitle","Sequence variability in three wheat germ agglutinin isolectins: products of multiple genes in polyploid wheat."
"2499688","abstracttext","Three highly homologous wheat germ isolectins (95-97%) are distinct gene products in hexaploid wheat. The amino acid sequences of two of these [wheat germ agglutinin 1 (WGA1) and 2 (WGA2)] are compared with sequence data derived from a complementary DNA (cDNA) clone for the third isolectin (WGA3). This comparison includes three corrections to earlier amino acid sequence data of both WGA1 and WGA2 at positions 109 (from Ser to Phe), 134 (from Gly to Lys), and 150 (from Gly to Trp). These reassignments are based on new results from crystal structure refinement and amino acid sequence data of WGA1, as well as the recently determined nucleotide sequence of WGA3. In addition, the C-terminal residue of WGA1 has been revised to Gly171 and now differs from WGA2 (Ala171). Four other positions, Asn9, Ala53, Gly119, and Ser123, at which WGA1 and WGA2 are identical but differ from the DNA sequence of WGA3, were also reinvestigated by amino acid sequencing techniques and confirmed. Variability among the three isolectins is observed at a total of 10 sequence positions: 9, 53, 56, 59, 66, 93, 109, 119, 123, and 171. Pairwise comparisons indicate that WGA3 deviates to a much larger extent from WGA1 (at eight positions) and from WGA2 (at seven positions) than the latter from one another (at five positions). Eight of the 10 mutations are equally distributed between domains B and C, the two interior and more highly conserved of the four WGA domains (A, B, C, D). Correlation of the variable residues with the three-dimensional structure indicates that all except the two previously described B-domain residues, 56 and 59 (Wright and Olafsdottir 1986), are easily accommodated at the dimer surface. WGA3 displays a higher degree of inter-domain similarity than found in WGA1 and WGA2. Of the seven variable positions that are located in the domain core (residues 3-31), five are in perfect agreement with our earlier predicted domain ancestor sequence. This suggests that of the three isolectins WGA3 is most closely related to the common ancestral molecule."
"1726558","articletitle","Expression of the wheat mitochondrial nad3-rps12 transcription unit: correlation between editing and mRNA maturation."
"1726558","abstracttext","In plant mitochondria, RNA editing involves the conversion of cytidines in the genomic DNA into uridines in the corresponding RNA. Analysis of cDNAs prepared by reverse transcription of mitochondrial RNAs has shown that partially edited RNAs are present in wheat mitochondria. The extent of this partial editing as well as its potential influence on the corresponding protein sequence were studied along with the expression of a wheat mitochondrial locus. The sequence, expression, and RNA editing of the wheat mitochondrial transcription unit containing four open reading frames (nad3, rps12, orf299, orf156), all cotranscribed into a same predominant precursor RNA, have been studied. The product of orf156 is an 18-kD mitochondrial membrane protein of unknown function, whereas the product of orf299 could not be detected and this sequence seems to be a pseudogene. Sequences of cDNA clones derived by the polymerase chain reaction technique show that nad3, rps12, and orf156 transcripts are edited, whereas orf299 is not edited, except for a sequence identical to part of the coxII gene. Analysis of cDNA clones obtained from the precursor RNA shows the presence of a large number of partially edited nad3-rps12 transcripts with no evident polarity for the editing process. This shows that RNA editing is a post-transcriptional event. In addition, study of partial editing at the level of precursor, mature, and polysomal transcripts shows that mainly mature, completely edited sequences are used for translation. Deletions of a nucleotide at editing sites were observed in a number of cDNA clones, suggesting that C----U RNA editing in plant mitochondria would be achieved by nucleotide replacement."

"1634109","abstracttext","The development of efficient methods for production and purification of plant seed storage proteins in heterologous microbial hosts would facilitate structure-function studies of these proteins. This report describes such methods applied to the production and isolation of wheat alpha-gliadin, a prolamine-type seed storage protein, from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Beginning with the vector, growth conditions, and extraction methods of Neill et al. [Gene 55 (1987) 303-317], we implemented several improvements to increase the yields of alpha-gliadin per volume of yeast cell culture. The CYCl::Gli-A2-Y transcriptional fusion vector, pAY31 (Neill et al., 1987), was modified by replacing the ARS1 region of replication with that of the 2 mu plasmid of yeast. We formulated a new medium, a derivative of synthetic defined (SD) medium supplemented with several nitrogen sources, that allows both selection for maintenance of plasmids and growth to high cell densities. Stationary phase cultures of cells bearing the modified expression vector, and grown in this medium with glycerol and lactate as carbon sources, contain significantly higher levels of alpha-gliadin than log-phase cultures grown in SD glucose. Sonication in 80% ethanol selectively and efficiently extracts the alpha-gliadin from cell pellets of small- or large-scale cultures, allowing the purification of several hundred micrograms of the wheat protein per liter in just a few high-yield steps. The alpha-gliadin isolated from yeast elutes at the same position in HPLC as the A-gliadin fraction purified from wheat flour. N-terminal amino acid (aa) sequencing reveals that the signal peptide is removed from the gliadin precursor in yeast cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

"1744128","abstracttext","We have identified two isoforms of initiation factor 4A (eIF-4A) in maize root tips, with distinct isoelectric points and similar molecular mass (approximately 50 kDa). Both isoforms of maize eIF-4A cross-react with antibodies raised against wheat germ eIF-4A, and one of the maize proteins (higher pI isoform) comigrates with purified wheat germ eIF-4A on two-dimensional gels. The two maize eIF-4As were indistinguishable by comparative peptide fingerprint analysis, which also showed a very strong similarity between eIF-4A in maize roots and wheat germ. Maize eIF-4As copurify with eIF-4F and eIF-(iso)4F on a 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose affinity column, indicating that they are part of the 5'-cap-binding complex. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting of proteins from 32P-labeled maize root tips revealed that the lower pI isoform of eIF-4A is phosphorylated. Two-dimensional phosphopeptide maps of trypsin-digested eIF-4A contained one principal phosphorylated fragment; phosphoamino acid analysis indicated phosphorylation of threonine. In oxygenated maize root tips, the ratio of phosphorylated to nonphosphorylated eIF-4A is approximately 0.2. This ratio increases to approximately 1 within 20 min following the onset of hypoxia, due to interconversion between the two maize eIF-4A isoforms. The hypoxia-induced phosphorylation of eIF-4A is discussed with respect to metabolic responses, and the translational control of gene expression, in hypoxic plant tissues."
"8915540","articletitle","Control of gene expression by base deamination: the case of RNA editing in wheat mitochondria."
"8915540","abstracttext","The term 'RNA editing' was used for the first time in 1986 to describe the process of uridylate insertion into trypanosomal mitochondrial transcripts. Since then, the term has been used more generally to describe a large variety of processes involving base insertions, deletions and conversions that generate RNAs with a primary sequence different to those encoded by the gene. RNA editing has been observed in the mitochondrial fraction of trypanosomes, plants and other organisms, in the animal nuclear fraction in the case of the apolipoprotein B and glutamate brain receptors mRNAs as well as in viruses like paramyxovirus, hepatitis delta and probably HIV. The role of cytidine and adenine deamination leading to C to U and A to I transitions has became pivotal to explain this process by base conversion. In this review we will focus mainly on the work performed in our group on plant mitochondria and more specifically on the mechanism and the functional significance of RNA editing in wheat organelles. The original contributions of our laboratory in this field are: i) showing that RNA editing is reflected at the protein level; ii) settling three in vitro systems to assay C to U conversion using a wheat mitochondrial lysate as source of enzymes and factors, and unedited mRNA from the same source, as substrate; iii) determination by double labelling of the unedited substrate that RNA editing in wheat mitochondria occurs via a deamination step; and iv) that introducing unedited proteins in the mitochondria of transgenic plants leads to the emergence of cytoplasmic male sterility supporting the idea that the role of this process is to produce functional proteins. Using the antisense approach in transgenic plants we were able to obtain a significant male fertility restoration."

"11472906","abstracttext","We released genetically modified Pseudomonas putida WCS358r into the rhizospheres of wheat plants. The two genetically modified derivatives, genetically modified microorganism (GMM) 2 and GMM 8, carried the phz biosynthetic gene locus of strain P. fluorescens 2-79 and constitutively produced the antifungal compound phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). In the springs of 1997 and 1998 we sowed wheat seeds treated with either GMM 2, GMM 8, or WCS358r (approximately 10(7) CFU per seed), and measured the numbers, composition, and activities of the rhizosphere microbial populations. During both growing seasons, all three bacterial strains decreased from 10(7) CFU per g of rhizosphere sample to below the limit of detection (10(2) CFU per g) 1 month after harvest of the wheat plants. The phz genes were stably maintained, and PCA was detected in rhizosphere extracts of GMM-treated plants. In 1997, but not in 1998, fungal numbers in the rhizosphere, quantified on 2% malt extract agar (total filamentous fungi) and on Komada's medium (mainly Fusarium spp.), were transiently suppressed in GMM 8-treated plants. We also analyzed the effects of the GMMs on the rhizosphere fungi by using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Introduction of any of the three bacterial strains transiently changed the composition of the rhizosphere fungal microflora. However, in both 1997 and 1998, GMM-induced effects were distinct from those of WCS358r and lasted for 40 days in 1997 and for 89 days after sowing in 1998, whereas effects induced by WCS358r were detectable for 12 (1997) or 40 (1998) days. None of the strains affected the metabolic activity of the soil microbial population (substrate-induced respiration), soil nitrification potential, cellulose decomposition, plant height, or plant yield. The results indicate that application of GMMs engineered to have improved antifungal activity can exert nontarget effects on the natural fungal microflora."
"10527417","articletitle","Elicitor- and A23187-induced expression of WCK-1, a gene encoding mitogen-activated protein kinase in wheat."
"10527417","abstracttext","Wheat cultured cells were used to study the role of Ca2+ in regulating protein kinases during the induction of defense-related genes by fungal elicitor treatments. Manipulation of intracellular Ca2+ concentrations by treatment with calcium ionophore A23187 in the presence of high extracellular Ca2+ resulted in the induction of mRNA expression of WCK-1, a gene encoding mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. The induction of WCK-1 mRNA by A23187 did not occur when extracellular Ca2+ was chelated by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA). The WCK-1 mRNA was also induced by Typhula ishikariensis-derived elicitors, suggesting a possible involvement of WCK-1 in the plant defense response against pathogens. BAPTA and a calcium channel blocker, La3+, inhibited the elicitor-induced expression of the WCK-1 mRNA. A recombinant fusion protein of WCK-1 (GST-WCK-1) autophosphorylated at the Tyr residue and exhibited an autophosphorylation-dependent protein kinase activity towards myelin basic protein. Alteration of Tyr-196 in the conserved 'TEY' motif in GST-WCK-1 to Phe by site-directed mutagenesis abolished the autophosphorylation. The GST-WCK-1 protein was activated by elicitor-treated wheat cell extracts but not by the control extract. These results suggest that fungal elicitors activate WCK-1, a specific MAP kinase in wheat. Furthermore, the results suggest a possible involvement of Ca2+ in enhancing the MAP kinase signaling cascade in plants by controlling the levels of the MAP kinase transcripts."

"12448757","abstracttext","Pseudomonas putida WCS358r, genetically modified to have improved activity against soil-borne pathogens, was released into the rhizosphere of wheat. Two genetically modified derivatives carried the phz or the phl biosynthetic gene loci and constitutively produced either the antifungal compound phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) or the antifungal and antibacterial compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG). In 1997 and 1998, effects of single introductions of PCA producing derivatives on the indigenous microflora were studied. A transient shift in the composition of the total fungal microflora, determined by amplified ribosomal DNA restiction analysis (ARDRA), was detected. Starting in 1999, effects of repeated introduction of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) were studied. Wheat seeds coated with the PCA producer, the DAPG producer, a mixture of the PCA and DAPG producers, or WCS358r, were sown and the densities, composition and activities of the rhizosphere microbial populations were measured. All introduced strains decreased from 10(7) CFU per gram of rhizosphere sample to below the detection limit after harvest of the wheat plants. The phz genes were stably maintained in the PCA producers, and PCA was detected in rhizosphere extracts of plants treated with this strain or with the mixture of the PCA and DAPG producers. The phl genes were also stably maintained in the DAPG producing derivative of WCS358r. Effects of the genetically modified bacteria on the rhizosphere fungi and bacteria were analyzed by using amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Introduction of the genetically modified bacterial strains caused a transient change in the composition of the rhizosphere microflora. However, introduction of the GMMs did not affect the several soil microbial activities that were investigated in this study."
"12756472","articletitle","Biochemical and genetic studies of two Heterodera avenae resistance genes transferred from Aegilops ventricosa to wheat."
"12756472","abstracttext","Two Heterodera avenae resistance genes, Cre2 from Aegilops ventricosa AP-1 and Cre5 from Ae. ventricosa #10, were shown to confer a high level of resistance to the Spanish pathotype Ha71. No susceptible plants were found in the F(2) progeny from the cross between the two accessions of Ae. ventricosa, suggesting that their respective resistance factors were allelic. However, genes Cre2 and Cre5 apparently were transferred to a different chromosomal location in the wheat line H-93-8 and in the 6M(v)(6D) substitution, respectively, as proved by F(2) segregation of their cross progeny. The induction of several defence responses during early infection by the same H. avenae pathotype in resistant lines carrying Cre2 or Cre5 genes was studied. Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) isozyme analysis revealed that peroxidase, esterase and superoxide dismutase activity increased after nematode infection, in roots of resistant lines in comparison with their susceptible parents. Differential induced isoforms were also identified when IEF patterns of resistant lines were compared. A DNA marker, absent in Cre5-carrying genotypes, was found to be linked, thought not very tightly, to the Cre2 gene in the H-93-8 line. The differences observed between the Cre2 and Cre5 genes with respect to their chromosomal location in wheat introgression lines, de-toxificant enzyme induction and behaviour against different pathotypes, suggest they are different H. avenae resistance sources for wheat breeding."

"12590342","abstracttext","The objective of this study was molecular characterization of a set of deletion stocks and other aneuploids for use in chromosome bin mapping of ESTs in wheat. Wheat aneuploid stocks including 21 nullisomic-tetrasomic (NT), 24 ditelosomic (Dt), and 101 deletion (del) lines were screened with 526 EST clones. A total of 1,951 loci were detected by 493 informative EST clones and tagged 150 of the 159 deletion intervals or chromosome bins. Previously described deletion lines del1AS-4, del6AL-2, del6BS-6, and del7DS-6 were found to have normal chromosome constitution. The short arm deletion in del3AS-3 may be translocated from an unknown chromosome as this stock is nullisomic for the 3AS arm. Thirty-five new deletions were detected in 26 lines. Most of the new deletions occurred in terminal regions of chromosomes and probably resulted from the loss of very small terminal fragments that were difficult to detect cytologically. Eleven chromosome aberrations were also detected in two NT and five Dt lines. Overall, the chromosome bin map provides a resolution of around 28 Mb for an anchor map of a basic set of seven chromosomes of the Triticeae. Any target gene can be allocated to a specific 28-Mb bin and associated ESTs, anchored to the other Triticeae/grass maps including rice and, therefore, amenable to molecular cloning by comparative and wheat-based positional cloning methods."

"15719212","abstracttext","A population of 96 doubled haploid lines (DHLs) was prepared from F1 plants of the hexaploid wheat cross Chinese Spring x SQ1 (a high abscisic acid-expressing breeding line) and was mapped with 567 RFLP, AFLP, SSR, morphological and biochemical markers covering all 21 chromosomes, with a total map length of 3,522 cM. Although the map lengths for each genome were very similar, the D genome had only half the markers of the other two genomes. The map was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for yield and yield components from a combination of 24 site x treatment x year combinations, including nutrient stress, drought stress and salt stress treatments. Although yield QTLs were widely distributed around the genome, 17 clusters of yield QTLs from five or more trials were identified: two on group 1 chromosomes, one each on group 2 and group 3, five on group 4, four on group 5, one on group 6 and three on group 7. The strongest yield QTL effects were on chromosomes 7AL and 7BL, due mainly to variation in grain numbers per ear. Three of the yield QTL clusters were largely site-specific, while four clusters were largely associated with one or other of the stress treatments. Three of the yield QTL clusters were coincident with the dwarfing gene Rht-B1 on 4BS and with the vernalisation genes Vrn-A1 on 5AL and Vrn-D1 on 5DL. Yields of each DHL were calculated for trial mean yields of 6 g plant(-1) and 2 g plant(-1) (equivalent to about 8 t ha(-1) and 2.5 t ha(-1), respectively), representing optimum and moderately stressed conditions. Analyses of these yield estimates using interval mapping confirmed the group-7 effects on yield and, at 2 g plant(-1), identified two additional major yield QTLs on chromosomes 1D and 5A. Many of the yield QTL clusters corresponded with QTLs already reported in wheat and, on the basis of comparative genetics, also in rice. The implications of these results for improving wheat yield stability are discussed."

"16022309","abstracttext","Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), is a residue-borne pest of spring wheat that can become important in reduced tillage production systems. The relative abundance of Hessian fly was examined on spring wheat cultivars grown under conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) practices in northern Idaho from 2000 to 2002. Six cultivars were tested: Hessian fly-susceptible 'Penawawa' and'Westbred 936' and -resistant (H3 gene) 'Wawawai', 'Jefferson', 'Hank', and 'Westbred 926.' Hessian fly egg densities were not significantly different among treatments, indicating ovipositing females showed no preference for tillage treatment or cultivar. Mean number of Hessian fly puparia per plant was significantly greater in CT plots during the last sampling in 2000; however, in 2001, NT plots had significantly more puparia than CT plots. Tillage had no significant effect on mean Hessian fly per plant in 2002. Significantly more puparia were observed on susceptible compared with resistant cultivars in 2000 and 2002. In 2001, susceptible Penawawa had significantly more puparia than resistant cultivars, whereas puparial densities on susceptible Westbred 936 were higher than on resistant cultivars other than Wawawai. Yield and 100-seed weight were not affected by tillage treatment. Significant variation in yield among cultivars was observed only in 2000, when fly-resistant Hank yielded the highest. Hank had the highest 100-seed weight in 2000 and 2001, whereas Penawawa and Jefferson had the lowest 100-seed weights each year. Reduced tillage had no consistent effect on spring wheat yield or abundance of Hessian fly under the conditions of our trials, which evaluated small plots."

"14614567","abstracttext","A set of 41 wheat microsatellite markers (WMS), giving 42 polymorphic loci (two loci on each chromosome), was used to describe genetic diversity in a sample of 559 French bread wheat accessions (landraces and registered varieties) cultivated between 1800 and 2000. A total of 609 alleles were detected. Allele number per locus ranged from 3 to 28, with a mean allele number of 14.5. On the average, about 72% of the total number of alleles were observed with a frequency of less than 5% and were considered to be rare alleles. WMS markers used showed different levels of gene diversity: the highest PIC value occurred in the B genome (0.686) compared to 0.641 and 0.659 for the A and D genomes, respectively. When comparing landraces with registered varieties gathered in seven temporal groups, a cluster analysis based on an F(st) matrix provided a clear separation of landraces from the seven variety groups, while a shift was observed between varieties registered before and after 1970. There was a decrease of about 25% in allelic richness between landraces and varieties. In contrast, when considering only registered varieties, changes in diversity related to temporal trends appeared more qualitative than quantitative, except at the end of the 1960s, when a bottleneck might have occurred. New varieties appear to be increasingly similar to each other in relation to allelic composition, while differences between landraces are more and more pronounced over time. Finally, considering a sub-sample of 193 varieties representative of breeding material selected during the twentieth century by the six most important plant breeding companies, few differences in diversity were observed between the different breeding programmes. The observed structure of diversity in French bread wheat collections is discussed in terms of consequences, both for plant breeders and for managers of crop genetic resources."

Two transgenic soft white winter wheat genotypes (103.1J and 126.02) derived from the parental variety Lambert and expressing the barley yellow dwarf virus coat protein gene, and two untransformed varieties, virus-susceptible Lambert and virus-tolerant Caldwell, were tested. B. padi nymphal development was significantly longer on the transgenic genotypes infected with BYDV, compared with noninfected transgenic plants. In contrast, nymphal development on Lambert was significantly shorter on BYDV-infected than on noninfected plants. Nymphal development on noninfected Lambert was significantly longer than on noninfected transgenics. No significant difference in nymphal development period was detected between virus-infected and noninfected Caldwell. Aphid total fecundity, length of reproductive period, and intrinsic rate of increase were significantly reduced on BYDV-infected transgenic plants compared with BYDV-infected Lambert. In contrast, reproductive period, total adult fecundity, and intrinsic rate of increase on noninfected Lambert were significantly reduced compared with noninfected transgenics. Transgenic plants infected with BYDV were inferior hosts for R. padi compared with infected Lambert. However, noninfected transgenics were superior hosts for aphids than noninfected Lambert. Moderate resistance to BYDV, as indicated by a significantly lower virus titer, was detected in the transgenic genotypes compared with the untransformed ones. Results show for the first time that transgenic virus resistance in wheat can indirectly influence R. padi life history."

"16359716","abstracttext","Lectin plays an important role in defense signaling in plants. A few genes of this family have been cloned. Here we report on a mannose-specific jacalin-related lectin in rice. Using sequence information of wheat gene VER2, which we had previously cloned, we were able to amplify a cDNA of OsJAC1 from Oryza sativa by RT-PCR. The cDNA of OsJAC1 was 1172 bp and contained a 921-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding dirigent (amino acids 26-139) and jacalin (amino acids 175-305) domains of 306 amino acids. Comparison of the OsJAC1 sequence with those of other lectins (jacalin) from rice, wheat and other species revealed that OsJAC1 had the 12 amino acid positions conserved in all mannose-binding lectins. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that OsJAC1 expression was present in stems, leaves and young spikes but not young roots; the expression was high in leaves and low in stems and spikes. And methyl jasmonate could induce the expression of OsJAC1. To test the activity of OsJAC1, the jacalin domain at the C-terminal was expressed in E. coli. BL21 (DE3). The purified recombinant protein could agglutinate red blood cells of rabbit, and the agglutination activity was strongly inhibited by mannose compared with other carbohydrates. These results indicate that lectin with dirigent and jacalin domains exists in rice as well as wheat. This is the first report of cDNA cloning of mannose-binding jacalin-related lectin with a dirigent domain in N-terminal region from O. sativa."

"16535129","abstracttext","In a field release experiment, an isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens, which was chromosomally modified with two reporter gene cassettes (lacZY and Kan(supr)-xylE), was applied to spring wheat as a seed coating and subsequently as a foliar spray. The wild-type strain was isolated from the phylloplane of sugar beet but was found to be a common colonizer of both the rizosphere and phylloplane of wheat as well. The impact on the indigenous microbial populations resulting from release of this genetically modified microorganism (GMM) was compared with the impact of the unmodified, wild-type strain and a nontreated control until 1 month after harvest of the crop. The release of the P. fluorescens GMM and the unmodified, wild-type strain resulted in significant but transient perturbations of some of the culturable components of the indigenous microbial communities that inhabited the rhizosphere and phylloplane of wheat, but no significant perturbations of the indigenous culturable microbial populations in nonrhizosphere soil were found. Fast-growing organisms that did not produce resting structures (for example, fluorescent pseudomonads and yeasts) seemed to be most sensitive to perturbation. In terms of hazard and risk to the environment, the observed microbial perturbations that resulted from this GMM release may be considered minor for several reasons. First, the recombinant P. fluorescens strain caused changes that were, in general, not significantly different from those caused by the unmodified wild-type strain; second, perturbations resulting from bacterial inoculations were mainly small; and third, the release of bacteria had no obvious effects on plant growth and plant health."
"16525885","articletitle","Effect of photoperiod on the regulation of wheat vernalization genes VRN1 and VRN2."
"16525885","abstracttext","Wheat is usually classified as a long day (LD) plant because most varieties flower earlier when exposed to longer days. In addition to LD, winter wheats require a long exposure to low temperatures (vernalization) to become competent for flowering. Here we show that in some genotypes this vernalization requirement can be replaced by interrupting the LD treatment by 6 weeks of short day (SD), and that this replacement is associated with the SD down-regulation of the VRN2 flowering repressor. In addition, we found that SD down-regulation of VRN2 at room temperature is not followed by the up-regulation of the meristem identity gene VRN1 until plants are transferred to LD. This result contrasts with the VRN1 up-regulation observed after the VRN2 down-regulation by vernalization, suggesting the existence of a second VRN1 repressor. Analysis of natural VRN1 mutants indicated that a CArG-box located in the VRN1 promoter is the most likely regulatory site for the interaction with this second repressor. Up-regulation of VRN1 under SD in accessions carrying mutations in the CArG-box resulted in an earlier initiation of spike development, compared to other genotypes. However, even the genotypes with CArG box mutations required LD for a normal and timely spike development. The SD acceleration of flowering was observed in photoperiod sensitive winter varieties. Since vernalization requirement and photoperiod sensitivity are ancestral traits in Triticeae species we suggest that wheat was initially a SD-LD plant and that strong selection pressures during domestication and breeding resulted in the modification of this dual regulation. The down-regulation of the VRN2 repressor by SD is likely part of the mechanism associated with the SD-LD regulation of flowering in photoperiod sensitive winter wheat."

"16816964","abstracttext","High molecular weight (HMW) glutenin subunits are conserved seed storage proteins in wheat and related species. Here we describe a more detailed characterization of the HMW glutenin subunits from Aegilops searsii, which is diploid and contains the S(s) genome related to the S genome of Aegilops speltoides and the A, B and D genomes of hexaploid wheat. SDS-PAGE experiments revealed two subunits (one x and one y) for each of the nine Ae. searsii accessions analyzed, indicating that the HMW glutenin subunit gene locus of Ae. searsii is similar to the Glu-1 locus found in wheat in containing both x and y genes. The primary structure of the four molecularly cloned subunits (from two Ae. searsii accessions) was highly similar to that of the previously reported x and y subunits. However, in one accession (IG49077), the last 159 residues of the x subunit (1S(s)x49077), which contained the sequence element GHCPTSPQQ, were identical to those of the y subunit (1S(s)y49077) from the same accession. Consequently, 1S(s)x49077 contains an extra cysteine residue located at the C-terminal part of its repetitive domain, which is novel compared to the x-type subunits reported so far. Based on this and previous studies, the structure and expression of the Glu-1 locus in Ae. searsii is discussed. A hypothesis on the genetic mechanism generating the coding sequence for the novel 1S(s)x49077 subunit is presented."

"18944066","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Reliable detection and quantification of barley and cereal yellow dwarf viruses (YDVs) is a critical component in managing yellow dwarf diseases in small grain cereal crops. The method currently used is enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using antisera against the coat proteins that are specific for each of the various YDVs. Recently, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (Q-RT-PCR) has been used to detect bacterial and viral pathogens and to study gene expression. We applied this technique to detect and quantify YDVs using primers specific for Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV (BYDV-PAV) and Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV (CYDV-RPV) coat protein genes because of the higher sensitivity of RT-PCR and the advantage of using a real-time PCR instrument. This Q-RT-PCR was used to detect BYDV and CYDV, and to examine disease development in a resistant wheatgrass, a resistant wheat line, a susceptible wheat line, and a susceptible oat line. BYDV-PAV and CYDV-RPV were detected as early as 2 and 6 h, respectively, in susceptible oat compared with detection by ELISA at 4 and 10 days postinoculation. BYDV-PAV RNA accumulated more rapidly and to a higher level than CYDV-RPV RNA in both oat and wheat, which may account for PAV being more prevalent and causing more severe viral disease than CYDV. Q-RT-PCR is reproducible, sensitive, and has the potential to be used for examining yellow dwarf disease and as a rapid diagnostic tool for YDVs."

"18944143","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Maize streak virus (MSV) is best known as the causal agent of maize streak disease. However, only a genetically uniform subset of the viruses within this diverse species is actually capable of producing severe symptoms in maize. Whereas these ""maize-type"" viruses all share greater than 95% sequence identity, MSV strains isolated from grasses may share as little as 79% sequence identity with the maize-type viruses. Here, we present the complete genome sequences and biological characterization of two MSV isolates from wheat that share approximately 89% sequence identity with the maize-type viruses. Clonal populations of these two isolates, named MSV-Tas and MSV-VW, were leafhopper-transmitted to Digitaria sanguinalis and a range of maize, wheat, and barley genotypes. Whereas the two viruses showed some differences in their pathogenicity in maize, they were both equally pathogenic in D. sanguinalis and the various wheat and barley genotypes tested. Phylogenetic analyses involving the genome sequences of MSV-Tas and MSV-VW, a new maize-type virus also fully sequenced in this study (MSV-VM), and all other available African streak virus sequences, indicated that MSV-Tas and MSV-VW are close relatives that together represent a distinct MSV strain. Sequence analyses revealed that MSV-VM has a recombinant genome containing MSV-Tas/VW-like sequences within its movement protein gene."
"18944416","articletitle","Role of Ascospores in Further Spread of QoI-Resistant Cytochrome b Alleles (G143A) in Field Populations of Mycosphaerella graminicola."
"18944416","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Strobilurin fungicides or quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs) have been used successfully to control Septoria leaf blotch in the United Kingdom since 1997. However, QoI-resistant isolates of Mycosphaerella graminicola were reported for the first time at Rothamsted during the summer of 2002. Sequence analysis of the cytochrome b gene revealed that all resistant isolates carried a mutation resulting in the replacement of glycine by alanine at codon 143 (G143A). Extensive monitoring using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing revealed that fungicide treatments based on QoIs rapidly selected for isolates carrying resistant A143 (R) alleles within field populations. This selection is driven mainly by polycyclic dispersal of abundantly produced asexual conidia over short distances. In order to investigate the role of sexually produced airborne ascospores in the further spread of R alleles, a method integrating spore trapping with real-time PCR assays was developed. This method enabled us to both quantify the number of M. graminicola ascospores in air samples as well as estimate the frequency of R alleles in ascospore populations. As expected, most ascospores were produced at the end of the growing season during senescence of the wheat crop. However, a rapid increase in R-allele frequency, from 35 to 80%, was measured immediately in airborne ascospore populations sampled in a wheat plot after the first QoI application at growth stage 32. After the second QoI application, most R-allele frequencies measured for M. graminicola populations present in leaves and aerosols sampled from the treated plot exceeded 90%. Spatial sampling and testing of M. graminicola flag leaf populations derived from ascospores in the surrounding crop showed that ascospores carrying R alleles can spread readily within the crop at distances of up to 85 m. After harvest, fewer ascospores were detected in air samples and the R-allele frequencies measured were influenced by ascospores originating from nearby wheat fields."

"18826586","abstracttext_background","Starch is of great importance to humans as a food and biomaterial, and the amount and structure of starch made in plants is determined in part by starch synthase (SS) activity. Five SS isoforms, SSI, II, III, IV and Granule Bound SSI, have been identified, each with a unique catalytic role in starch synthesis. The basic mode of action of SSs is known; however our knowledge of several aspects of SS enzymology at the structural and mechanistic level is incomplete. To gain a better understanding of the differences in SS sequences that underscore their specificity, the previously uncharacterised SSIVb from wheat was cloned and extensive bioinformatics analyses of this and other SSs sequences were done."
"18826586","abstracttext_results","The wheat SSIV cDNA is most similar to rice SSIVb with which it shows synteny and shares a similar exon-intron arrangement. The wheat SSIVb gene was preferentially expressed in leaf and was not regulated by a circadian clock. Phylogenetic analysis showed that in plants, SSIV is closely related to SSIII, while SSI, SSII and Granule Bound SSI clustered together and distinctions between the two groups can be made at the genetic level and included chromosomal location and intron conservation. Further, identified differences at the amino acid level in their glycosyltransferase domains, predicted secondary structures, global conformations and conserved residues might be indicative of intragroup functional associations."
"18826586","abstracttext_conclusion","Based on bioinformatics analysis of the catalytic region of 36 SSs and 3 glycogen synthases (GSs), it is suggested that the valine residue in the highly conserved K-X-G-G-L motif in SSIII and SSIV may be a determining feature of primer specificity of these SSs as compared to GBSSI, SSI and SSII. In GBSSI, the Ile485 residue may partially explain that enzyme's unique catalytic features. The flexible 380s Loop in the starch catalytic domain may be important in defining the specificity of action for each different SS and the G-X-G in motif VI could define SSIV and SSIII action particularly."
"18815766","articletitle","Quantitative trait loci for non-race-specific, high-temperature adult-plant resistance to stripe rust in wheat cultivar Express."
"18815766","abstracttext","Wheat cultivar Express has durable, high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici). To elucidate the genetic basis of the resistance, Express was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible' (AVS). A mapping population of 146 F(5) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed using single-seed descent. The RILs were evaluated at two sites near Pullman in eastern Washington and one site near Mount Vernon in western Washington in 2005, and were evaluated near Pullman in 2006 under natural stripe rust infection of predominant races virulent on seedlings of Express. Infection type (IT) and disease severity (DS) were recorded three times for each line during each growing season. The DS data were used to calculate relative area under the disease progress curve (rAUDPC) values. Both IT and rAUDPC data showed continuous distributions, indicating that the Express HTAP resistance was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL). Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to map the HTAP resistance QTL. Three QTL were detected with significant additive effects, explaining 49.5-69.6% of the phenotypic variation for rAUDPC. Two of the QTL explained 30.8-42.7% of the phenotypic variation for IT. The three QTL were mapped to wheat chromosomes 6AS, 3BL and 1BL, and were designated as QYrex.wgp-6AS, QYrex.wgp-3BL and QYrex.wgp-1BL, respectively. QYrex.wgp-6AS and QYrex.wgp-3BL, which had higher effects than QYrex.wgp-1BL, were different from previously reported QTL/genes for adult-plant resistance. Markers Xgwm334-Xwgp56 and Xgwm299-Xwgp66 flanking the two major QTL were highly polymorphic in various wheat genotypes, suggesting that these markers are useful in marker-assisted selection."

"18379752","abstracttext","Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a major constraint for wheat production in acid soils worldwide. Chinese landrace FSW demonstrates a high level of Al resistance. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between FSW and an Al-sensitive Chinese line, ND35, using single seed descent, to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Al resistance. Wheat reaction to Al stress was measured by net root growth (NRG) in a nutrient solution culture containing Al(3+) and hematoxylin staining score (HSS) of root after Al stress. After 1,437 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were screened using bulk segregant analysis, three QTLs were identified to control Al resistance in FSW. One major QTL (Qalt.pser-4DL) was mapped on chromosome 4DL that co-segregated with Xups4, a marker for the promoter of the Al-activated malate transporter (ALMT1) gene. The other two QTLs (Qalt.pser-3BL, Qalt.pser-2A) were located on chromosomes 3BL and 2A, respectively. Together, the three QTLs accounted for up to 81.9% of the phenotypic variation for HSS and 78.3% of the variation for NRG. The physical positions of flanking markers for Qalt.pser-4DL and Qalt.pser-3BL were determined by analyzing these markers in corresponding nulli-tetrasomic, ditelosomic, and 3BL deletion lines of Chinese Spring. Qalt.pser-3BL is a novel QTL with a major effect on Al resistance discovered in this study. The two major QTLs on 4DL and 3BL demonstrated an additive effect. The SSR markers closely linked to the QTLs have potential to be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to improve Al resistance of wheat cultivars in breeding programs."

"17371549","abstracttext","We cloned a new cysteine proteinase of wheat seed origin, which hydrolyzed the storage protein gliadin almost specifically, and was named gliadain. Gliadain mRNA was expressed 1 day after the start of seed imbibition, and showed a gradual increase thereafter. Gliadain expression was suppressed when uniconazol, a gibberellin synthesis inhibitor, was added to germinating seeds. Histochemical detection with anti-gliadain serum indicated that gliadain was present in the aleurone layer and also that its expression intensity increased in sites nearer the embryo. The enzymological characteristics of gliadain were investigated using recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-progliadain fusion protein produced in Escherichia coli. The GST-progliadain almost specifically digested gliadin into low molecular mass peptides. These results indicate that gliadain is produced via gibberellin-mediated gene activation in aleurone cells and secreted into the endosperm to digest its storage proteins. Enzymologically, the GST-progliadain hydrolyzed benzyloxycarbonyl-Phe-Arg-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (Z-Phe-Arg-NH(2)-Mec) at K(m) = 9.5 microm, which is equivalent to the K(m) value for hydrolysis of this substrate by cathepsin L. Hydrolysis was inhibited by two wheat cystatins, WC1 and WC4, with IC(50) values of 1.7 x 10(-8) and 5.0 x 10(-8) m, respectively. These values are comparable with those found for GST-progliadain inhibition by E-64 and egg-white cystatin, and are consistent with the possibility that, in germinating wheat seeds, gliadain is under the control of intrinsic cystatins."

"17556529","abstracttext","Although copia retrotransposons are major components of all plant genomes, the evolutionary relationships between individual copia families and between elements from different plant species are only poorly studied. We used 20 copia families from the large-genome plants barley and wheat to identify 46 families of homologous copia elements from rice and 22 from Arabidopsis, two plant species with much smaller genomes. In total, 599 copia elements were analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis showed that copia elements from the four species can be classified into six ancient lineages that existed before the divergence of monocots and dicots. The six lineages show a surprising degree of conservation in sequence organization and other characteristics across species. Additionally, the phylogenetic data suggest at least one case of horizontal gene transfer between the Arabidopsis and rice lineages. Insertion time estimates for 522 high-copy elements showed that retrotransposons from rice were active at different times in waves of activity lasting 0.5-2 million years, depending on the family, whereas elements from wheat and barley had longer periods of activity. We estimated that half of the rice copia elements are truncated or otherwise rearranged after approximately 790,000 yr, which is almost twice the half-life of Arabidopsis elements. In contrast, wheat and barley copia elements appear to have a massively longer half-life, beyond our ability to estimate from the available data. These findings suggest that genome size can be explained by the specific rate of DNA removal from the genome and the length of active periods of retrotransposon families."

"18713365","abstracttext","The high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) pair 1Bx13 + 1By16are recognized to positively correlate with bread-making quality; however, their molecular data remain unknown. In order to reveal the mechanism by which 1By16 and 1Bx13 creates high quality, their open reading frames (ORFs) were amplified from common wheat Atlas66 and Jimai 20 using primers that were designed based on published sequences of HMW glutenin genes. The ORF of 1By16 was 2,220 bp, deduced into 738 amino acid residues with seven cysteines including 59 hexapeptides and 22 nanopeptides motifs. The ORF of 1Bx13 was 2,385 bp, deduced into 795 amino acid residues with four cysteines including 68 hexapeptides, 25 nanopeptides and six tripeptides motifs. We found that 1By16 was the largest y-type HMW glutenin gene described to date in common wheat. The 1By16 had 36 amino acid residues inserted in the central repetitive domain compared with 1By15. Expression in bacteria and western-blot tests confirmed that the sequence cloned was the ORF of HMW-GS 1By16, and that 1Bx13 was one of the largest 1Bx genes that have been described so far in common wheat, exhibiting a hexapeptide (PGQGQQ) insertion in the end of central repetitive domain compared with 1Bx7. A phylogenetic tree based on the deduced full-length amino acid sequence alignment of the published HMW-GS genes showed that the 1By16 was clustered with Glu-1B-2, and that the 1Bx13 was clustered with Glu-1B-1 alleles."
"20204855","articletitle","Cell-free protein synthesis for structure determination by X-ray crystallography."
"20204855","abstracttext","Structure determination has been difficult for those proteins that are toxic to the cells and cannot be prepared in a large amount in vivo. These proteins, even when biologically very interesting, tend to be left uncharacterized in the structural genomics projects. Their cell-free synthesis can bypass the toxicity problem. Among the various cell-free systems, the wheat-germ-based system is of special interest due to the following points: (1) Because the gene is placed under a plant translational signal, its toxic expression in a bacterial host is reduced. (2) It has only little codon preference and, especially, little discrimination between methionine and selenomethionine (SeMet), which allows easy preparation of selenomethionylated proteins for crystal structure determination by SAD and MAD methods. (3) Translation is uncoupled from transcription, so that the toxicity of the translation product on DNA and its transcription, if any, can be bypassed. We have shown that the wheat-germ-based cell-free protein synthesis is useful for X-ray crystallography of one of the 4-bp cutter restriction enzymes, which are expected to be very toxic to all forms of cells retaining the genome. Our report on its structure represents the first report of structure determination by X-ray crystallography using protein overexpressed with the wheat-germ-based cell-free protein expression system. This will be a method of choice for cytotoxic proteins when its cost is not a problem. Its use will become popular when the crystal structure determination technology has evolved to require only a tiny amount of protein."

"20302539","abstracttext","Clonal populations of the aphid, Schizaphis graminum, have been separated into biotypes based on host preference and their ability to overcome resistance genes in wheat. Recently, several biotypes were found to differ in their ability to transmit one or more of the viruses that cause barley yellow dwarf disease in grain crops, and vector competence was linked to host preference. The genetics of host preference has been studied in S. graminum, but how this may relate to the transmission of plant viruses is unknown. Sexual morphs of a vector and nonvector S. graminum genotype were induced from parthenogenetic females and reciprocal crosses made. Eighty-nine hybrids were generated and maintained by parthenogenesis. Each hybrid was evaluated for its ability to transmit Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAV and Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV, and for its ability to colonize two wheat genotypes each expressing a different gene that confers resistance to S. graminum. The F1 genotypes were genetically variable for their ability to transmit virus and to colonize the aphid resistant wheat, but these traits were not genetically correlated. Individual F1 genotypes ranged in transmission efficiency from 0-100% for both viruses, although the overall mean transmission efficiency was similar to the transmission competent parent, indicating directional dominance. The direction of the cross did not significantly affect the vector competency for either virus, suggesting that maternally inherited cytoplasmic factors, or bacterial endosymbionts, did not contribute significantly to the inheritance of vector competency in S. graminum. Importantly, there was no genetic correlation between the ability to transmit Barley yellow dwarf virus and Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV in the F1 genotypes. These results taken together indicate that multiple loci are involved in the circulative transmission, and that the successful transmission of these closely related viruses is regulated by different sets of aphid genes."

Alpha-amylase inhibitors have been widely investigated for their possible use in strengthening a plant's defense against insects that are highly dependent on starch as an energy source. We attempted to unravel the diversity of monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes of Israeli and Golan Heights' wild emmer wheat with different ecological factors (e.g., geography, water, and temperature). Population methods that analyze the nature and frequency of allele diversity within a species and the codon analysis method (comparing patterns of synonymous and non-synonymous changes in protein coding sequences) were used to detect natural selection."
"20534122","abstracttext_results","Three hundred and forty-eight sequences encoding monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors (WMAI) were obtained from 14 populations of wild emmer wheat. The frequency of SNPs in WMAI genes was 1 out of 16.3 bases, where 28 SNPs were detected in the coding sequence. The results of purifying and the positive selection hypothesis (p < 0.05) showed that the sequences of WMAI were contributed by both natural selection and co-evolution, which ensured conservation of protein function and inhibition against diverse insect amylases. The majority of amino acid substitutions occurred at the C-terminal (positive selection domain), which ensured the stability of WMAI. SNPs in this gene could be classified into several categories associated with water, temperature, and geographic factors, respectively."
"20534122","abstracttext_conclusions","Great diversity at the WMAI locus, both between and within populations, was detected in the populations of wild emmer wheat. It was revealed that WMAI were naturally selected for across populations by a ratio of dN/dS as expected. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in the SNPs. A sharp genetic divergence over very short geographic distances compared to a small genetic divergence between large geographic distances also suggested that the SNPs were subjected to natural selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary role in polymorphisms at this locus. According to population and codon analysis, these results suggested that monomeric alpha-amylase inhibitors are adaptively selected under different environmental conditions."

After 4 weeks of experimental feeding, fish fed AN diet showed the highest body mass and length. Significantly lower mass occurred in groups fed PP, AA, CON, and Z. Fish fed CON diet showed the lowest intestinal folds and the highest number of mucous cells. Fish fed PP diet showed a significantly higher number of gastrin/cholecystokinin (CCK) positive cells. The diameter of lipid vacuoles in hepatocyte cytoplasm of fish fed formulated diets (PP, AA and CON) was significantly higher than in fish fed zooplankton (Z) and the commercial diet (AN). Hepatocytes of fish fed AA and CON showed a higher nucleus proliferation rate than in the other experimental groups. The quantitative analysis of the number of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and caspase-3(rabbit polyclonal antibody CPP-32)-positive cells showed that the highest proliferation rate was accompanied by the high apoptosis in the intestine of fish fed AA and CON. After 4 weeks of experimental feeding the highest relative expression of PepT1 gene was observed in fish fed PP diet, while the lowest expression occurred in fish fed CON.

"21935674","abstracttext","Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-based virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an effective strategy for rapid functional analysis of genes in wheat leaves, but its utility to transiently express genes, and silencing in other tissues including root, flower, and developing grains, has not been demonstrated in monocots. We monitored green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression to demonstrate the utility of BSMV as a transient expression vector and silenced genes in various wheat tissues to expand VIGS utility to characterize tissue-specific genes. An antisense construct designed for coronatine insensitive1 (COI1) showed an 85% decrease in COI1 transcript level in roots accompanied by a 26% reduction in root length. Similarly, silencing of seed-specific granule-bound starch synthase by antisense and hairpin constructs resulted in up to 82% reduction in amylose content of the developing grains. VIGS of meiosis-specific genes demonstrated by silencing wheat homologue of disrupted meiosis cDNA1 (DMC1) by an antisense construct resulted in a 75-80% reduction in DMC1 transcript level accompanied by an average of 37.2 univalents at metaphase I. The virus-based transient GFP expression was observed in the leaf, phloem, and root cortex at 10-17 days post-inoculation. A novel observation was made that 8-11% of the first selfed generation progeny showed VIGS inheritance and that this proportion increased to 53-72% in the second and to 90-100% in the third generations. No viral symptoms were observed in the progeny, making it possible to study agronomic traits by VIGS. VIGS inheritance is particularly useful to study genes expressing during seed germination or other stages of early plant growth."

"21922222","abstracttext","Recent results obtained in various crops indicate that real-time PCR could be a powerful tool for the detection and characterization of transgene locus structures. The determination of transgenic locus number through real-time PCR overcomes the problems linked to phenotypic segregation analysis (i.e. lack of detectable expression even when the transgenes are present) and can analyse hundreds of samples in a day, making it an efficient method for estimating gene copy number. Despite these advantages, many authors speak of ""estimating"" copy number by real-time PCR, and this is because the detection of a precise number of transgene depends on how well real-time PCR performs.This study was conducted to determine transgene copy number in transgenic wheat lines and to investigate potential variability in sensitivity and resolution of real-time chemistry by TaqMan probes. We have applied real-time PCR to a set of four transgenic durum wheat lines previously obtained. A total of 24 experiments (three experiments for two genes in each transgenic line) were conducted and standard curves were obtained from serial dilutions of the plasmids containing the genes of interest. The correlation coefficients ranged from 0.95 to 0.97. By using TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR we were able to detect 1 to 41 copies of transgenes per haploid genome in the DNA of homozygous T4 transformants. Although a slight variability was observed among PCR experiments, in our study we found real-time PCR to be a fast, sensitive and reliable method for the detection of transgene copy number in durum wheat, and a useful adjunct to Southern blot and FISH analyses to detect the presence of transgenic DNA in plant material."

"21887262","abstracttext","Wide hybrids can have novel traits or changed expression of a quantitative trait that their parents do not have. These phenomena have long been noticed, yet the mechanisms are poorly understood. High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) are seed storage proteins encoded by Glu-1 genes that only express in endosperm in wheat and its related species. Novel HMW-GS compositions have been observed in their hybrids. This research elucidated the molecular mechanisms by investigating the causative factors of novel HMW-GS changes in wheat-rye hybrids. HMW-GS compositions in the endosperm and their coding sequences in the leaves of F(1) and F(2) hybrids between wheat landrace Shinchunaga and rye landrace Qinling were investigated. Missing and/or additional novel HMW-GSs were observed in the endosperm of 0.5% of the 2078 F(1) and 22% of 36 F(2) hybrid seeds. The wildtype Glu-1Ax null allele was found to have 42 types of short repeat sequences of 3-60 bp long that appeared 2 to 100 times. It also has an in-frame stop codon in the central repetitive region. Analyzing cloned allele sequences of HMW-GS coding gene Glu-1 revealed that deletions involving the in-frame stop codon had happened, resulting in novel ∼1.8-kb Glu-1Ax alleles in some F(1) and F(2) plants. The cloned mutant Glu-1Ax alleles were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the HMW-GSs produced matched the novel HMW-GSs found in the hybrids. The differential changes between the endosperm and the plant of the same hybrids and the data of E. coli expression of the cloned deletion alleles both suggested that mitotic illegitimate recombination between two copies of a short repeat sequence had resulted in the deletions and thus the changed HMW-GS compositions. Our experiments have provided the first direct evidence to show that mitotic illegitimate recombination is a mechanism that produces novel phenotypes in wide hybrids."

"21867962","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) causes stripe rust, one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide. cDNA libraries had been constructed from urediniospores, germinated urediniospores and haustoria. However, little is known about the expression patterns of the genes related to the infection process and sporulation of the pathogen. In this study, a custom oligonucleotide microarray was constructed using sequences of 442 gene transcripts selected from Pst cDNA libraries. The expression patterns of the genes were determined by hybridizing the microarray with cDNA from Pst in vitro and Pst-infected wheat leaves. The time course study identified 55 transcripts that were differentially expressed during the infection process in a compatible interaction. They were identified to have functions related to the following biological processes, including carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, energy, cell signaling, protein synthesis, cell structure and division. In an incompatible interaction, 17 transcripts of the pathogen were differentially expressed in resistant wheat leaves inoculated with an avirulent Pst race, ten of which had similar expression patterns to those in the compatible interaction. Several candidates for pathogenicity and virulence/avirulence related genes were also identified. The results of quantitative real-time PCR validated the expression patterns of some selected genes. The study demonstrates that the custom oligonucleotide microarray technology is useful to determine the expression patterns of the pathogen genes involved in different types of the host-pathogen interactions and stages of development."

Fecal samples from 51 participants (25 males, 26 females) before and after the intervention were processed for the microbiota analysis using a phylogenetic microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reactions targeting the 16S rRNA gene. The intake of whole grains calculated from food records was higher in the group consuming rye breads (75 g) than in that consuming refined wheat breads (4 g; P < 0.001), confirmed by fasting plasma alkylrecorsinol concentrations, a biomarker of whole grain intake. The intestinal microbiota composition did not significantly differ between the groups after the intervention. However, we detected a 37% decrease of Bacteroidetes (P < 0.05) in parallel to a 53% decrease in the alkylrecorsinol concentration (P < 0.001) in the group consuming refined wheat breads. In this group, the abundance of bacteria related to Bacteroides vulgatus, B. plebeius, and Prevotella tannerae decreased, whereas that of bacteria related to Collinsella and members of the Clostridium clusters IV and XI increased. In a multivariate regression analysis, the abundance of Bacteroides spp. was best explained by different fat compounds among dietary variables, whereas the main sugar-converting butyrate-producers were mostly associated with the intake of whole- and refined-grain bread and fiber. Our results indicate that the quality of grains has a minor effect on the intestinal microbiota composition in participants with metabolic syndrome and suggest that the dietary influence on the microbiota involves other dietary components such as fat."

"22544251","abstracttext","Soft rot (type II) fungi belonging to the family Xylariaceae are known to substantially degrade hardwood by means of their poorly understood lignocellulolytic system, which comprises various hydrolases, including feruloyl esterases and laccase. In the present study, several members of the Xylariaceae were found to exhibit high feruloyl esterase activity during growth on lignocellulosic materials such as wheat straw (up to 1,675 mU g(-1)) or beech wood (up to 80 mU g(-1)). Following the ester-cleaving activity toward methyl ferulate, a hydrolase of Xylaria polymorpha was produced in solid-state culture on wheat straw and purified by different steps of anion-exchange and size-exclusion chromatography to apparent homogeneity (specific activity, 2.2 U mg(-1)). The peptide sequence of the purified protein deduced from the gene sequence and verified by de novo peptide sequencing shows high similarity to putative α-L-rhamnosidase sequences belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 78 (GH78; classified under EC 3.2.1.40). The purified enzyme (98 kDa by SDS-PAGE, 103 kDa by size-exclusion chromatography; pI 3.7) converted diverse glycosides (e.g., α-L-rhamnopyranoside and α-L-arabinofuranoside) but also natural and synthetic esters (e.g., chlorogenic acid, hydroxycinnamic acid glycoside esters, veratric acid esters, or p-nitrophenyl acetate) and released free hydroxycinnamic acids (ferulic and coumaric acid) from arabinoxylan and milled wheat straw. These catalytic properties strongly suggest that X. polymorpha GH78 is a multifunctional enzyme. It is the first fungal enzyme that combines glycosyl hydrolase with esterase activities and may help this soft rot fungus to degrade lignocelluloses."

"20960006","abstracttext","Comparative transcriptomics are useful to determine the role of orthologous genes among Triticeae species. Thus they constitute an interesting tool to improve the use of wild relatives for crop breeding. Reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is the most accurate measure of gene expression but efficient normalization is required. The choice and optimal number of reference genes must be experimentally determined and the primers optimized for cross-species amplification. Our goal was to test the utility of wheat-reference genes for qPCR normalization when species carrying the following genomes (A, B, D, R, H ( v ) and H ( ch )) are compared either simultaneously or in smaller subsets of samples. Wheat/barley/rye consensus primers outperformed wheat-specific ones which indicate that consensus primers should be considered for data normalization in comparative transcriptomics. All genes tested were stable but their ranking in terms of stability differed among subsets of samples. CDC (cell division control protein, AAA-superfamily of ATPases, Ta54227) and RLI (68 kDa protein HP68 similar to Arabidopsis thaliana RNase L inhibitor protein, Ta2776) were always among the three most stable genes. The optimal number of reference genes varied between 2 and 3 depending on the subset of samples and the method used (geNorm vs. coefficient of determination between sequential normalization factors). In any case a maximum number of three reference genes would provide adequate normalization independent of the subset of samples considered. This work constitutes a substantial advance towards comparative transcriptomics using qPCR since it provides useful primers/reference genes."

"21054876","abstracttext_background","The overall research objective was to develop single cell plant cultures as a model system to facilitate functional genomics of monocots, in particular wheat and barley. The essential first step towards achieving the stated objective was the development of a robust, viable single cell suspension culture from both species."
"21054876","abstracttext_results","We established growth conditions to allow routine culturing of somatic cells in 24 well microtiter plate format. Evaluation of the wheat and barley cell suspension as model cell system is a multi step process. As an initial step in the evaluation procedure we chose to study the impact of selected abiotic stress elicitors at the physiological, biochemical and molecular level. We report the results of osmotic stress imposed by NaCl and PEG. As proline is an important osmoprotectant of the cereal cells, colorimetric assay for proline detection was developed for small volumes (200 μl). We performed RT-PCR experiments to study the change in the expression of the genes encoding Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase (P5CS) and Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductase (PC5R) in response to abiotic stress."
"21054876","abstracttext_conclusions","We found differences between the wheat and barley suspension cultures, barley being more tolerant to the applied osmotic stresses. We suggested a model to explain the obtained differences in stress tolerance between the two species. The suspension cell cultures have proven useful for determining changes in proline concentration and expression level of genes (P5CS, P5CR) under various treatments and we suggest that the cells can be used as a model host system to study gene expression and regulation in monocots."
"21331631","articletitle","The soybean GmbZIP1 transcription factor enhances multiple abiotic stress tolerances in transgenic plants."
"21331631","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA)-responsive element binding proteins (AREBs) are basic domain/leucine zipper transcription factors that bind to the ABA-responsive element (ABRE) in the promoter regions of ABA-inducible genes in plants. A novel bZIP transcription factor gene, GmbZIP1, encoding 438 amino acids with a conserved bZIP domain composed of 60 amino acids was isolated from salt-tolerant soybean cv. Tiefeng 8. Southern blotting showed that only one copy was present in the soybean genome. Phylogenetic analyses showed that GmbZIP1 belonged to the AREB subfamily of the bZIP family and was most closely related to AtABF2 and OsTRAB1. The expression of GmbZIP1 was highly induced by ABA, drought, high salt and low temperature; and GmbZIP1 was expressed in soybean roots, stems and leaves under different stress conditions. GmbZIP1 was localized inside the nuclei of transformed onion epidermal cells. Overexpression of GmbZIP1 enhanced the responses of transgenic plants to ABA and triggered stomatal closure under stresses, potentially leading to improved tolerances to several abiotic stresses such as high salt, low temperature and drought in transgenic plants. Furthermore, overexpression of GmbZIP1 affected the expression of some ABA or stress-related genes involved in regulating stomatal closure in Arabidopsis under ABA, drought and high salt stress conditions. A few AREB elements were detected in the promoter region of those ABA or stress-related genes, suggesting that GmbZIP1 regulates the ABA response or stomatal closure mediated by those downstream genes in transgenic Arabidopsis. Moreover, GmbZIP1 was used to improve the drought tolerance trait of Chinese wheat varieties BS93. Functional analysis showed that overexpression of GmbZIP1 enhanced the drought tolerance of transgenic wheat, and transcripts of GmbZIP1 were detected in transgenic wheat using RT-PCR. In addition, GmbZIP1 overexpression did not result in growth retardation in all transgenic plants, suggesting that GmbZIP1 may be a valuable genetic resource for engineering stress tolerance of crops."

"21344185","abstracttext","Two Iranian common wheat landraces AUS28183 and AUS28187 from the Watkins collection showed high levels of seedling resistance against Australian pathotypes of leaf rust and stripe rust pathogens. Chi-squared analyses of rust response segregation among F(3) populations derived from crosses of AUS28183 and AUS28187 with a susceptible genotype AUS27229 revealed monogenic inheritance of leaf rust and stripe rust resistance. As both genotypes produced similar leaf rust and stripe rust infection types, they were assumed to carry the same genes. The genes were temporarily named as LrW1 and YrW1. Molecular mapping placed LrW1 and YrW1 in the short arm of chromosome 5B, about 10 and 15 cM proximal to the SSR marker gwm234, respectively, and the marker cfb309 mapped 8-12 cM proximal to YrW1. LrW1 mapped 3-6 cM distal to YrW1 in two F(3) populations. AUS28183 corresponded to the accession V336 of the Watkins collection which was the original source of Lr52. Based on the genomic location and accession records, LrW1 was concluded to be Lr52. Because no other seedling stripe rust resistance gene has previously been mapped in chromosome 5BS, YrW1 was permanently named as Yr47. A combination of flanking markers gwm234 and cfb309 with phenotypic assays could be used to ascertain the presence of Lr52 and Yr47 in segregating populations. This investigation characterised a valuable source of dual leaf rust and stripe rust resistance for deployment in new wheat cultivars. Transfer of Lr52 and Yr47 into current Australian wheat backgrounds is in progress."

"21421352","abstracttext","Cold hardening of winter wheat at 2 °C for 1-6 wks increased resistance to the snow mould pathogens LTB, Typhula incarnata, and Microdochium nivale as well as to powdery mildew (Blumaria graminis f. sp. graminis) and stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis). Using microarrays and hardening of winter wheat for 0.25, 0.5, 1, 7, 21 and 49 d, an upregulation of a wide range of stress-response genes that include defence-related and abiotic stress-related genes, transcription factors including several lipoxygenases and ethylene responsive factors, and WRKY genes was observed. For the majority of these genes, the upregulation occurred later in the 21-49 d hardening treatments and coincided with the highest expression levels of snow mould resistance. Defence-related sequences were upregulated to a greater extent and were more numerous in the snow mould resistant line CI14106 compared to cold hardy DH+268. Transcript profiling of candidate defence and other stress-related genes under prolonged conditions at -3 °C with or without snow mould infection showed that there was a decline in transcripts of the defence-related genes PR1.1b and NPR3 during the 12wks incubation. Additionally, 14 d hardening was insufficient to permit full expression of the jasmonic acid synthesis gene, allene oxide synthase (AOS) and the fructan degrading enzyme β-fructofuranosidase compared the 42 d hardening treatment. The snow mould resistant line CI14106 was able to maintain higher transcript levels of AOS for longer conditions compared to the susceptible line Norstar under artificial snow mould conditions. These results explain the nature of cold-induced resistance to snow moulds and provide direction on establishing selection criteria for improving resistance and cold tolerance in winter wheat."

"21715970","abstracttext","A commercially important alkaline protease, produced by Bacillus sp. RRM1 isolated from the red seaweed Kappaphycus alvarezii (Doty) Doty ex Silva, was first recognized and characterized in the present study. Identification of the isolated bacterium was done using both biochemical characterization as well as 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The bacterial strain, Bacillus sp. RRM1, produced a high level of protease using easily available, inexpensive agricultural residues solid-state fermentation (SSF). Among them, wheat bran was found to be the best substrate. Influences of process parameters such as moistening agents, moisture level, temperature, inoculum concentration, and co-carbon and co-nitrogen sources on the fermentation were also evaluated. Under optimized conditions, maximum protease production (i.e., 2081 U/g) was obtained from wheat bran, which is about 2-fold greater than the initial conditions. The protease enzyme was stable over a temperature range of 30-60 degrees C and pH 6-12, with maximum activity at 50 degrees C and pH 9.0. Whereas the metal ions Na+, Ca2+, and K+ enhanced the activity of the enzyme, others such as Hg2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Co2+, and Zn2+ had rendered negative effects. The activity of the enzyme was inhibited by EDTA and enhanced by Cu2+ ions, thus indicating the nature of the enzyme as a metalloprotease. The enzyme showed extreme stability and activity even in the presence of detergents, surfactants, and organic solvents. Moreover, the present findings opened new vistas in the utilization of wheat bran, a cheap, abundantly available, and effective waste as a substrate for SSF."

"21796382","abstracttext","Corynebacterium glutamicum wild type lacks the ability to utilize the pentose fractions of lignocellulosic hydrolysates, but it is known that recombinants expressing the araBAD operon and/or the xylA gene from Escherichia coli are able to grow with the pentoses xylose and arabinose as sole carbon sources. Recombinant pentose-utilizing strains derived from C. glutamicum wild type or from the L-lysine-producing C. glutamicum strain DM1729 utilized arabinose and/or xylose when these were added as pure chemicals to glucose-based minimal medium or when they were present in acid hydrolysates of rice straw or wheat bran. The recombinants grew to higher biomass concentrations and produced more L-glutamate and L-lysine, respectively, than the empty vector control strains, which utilized the glucose fraction. Typically, arabinose and xylose were co-utilized by the recombinant strains along with glucose either when acid rice straw and wheat bran hydrolysates were used or when blends of pure arabinose, xylose, and glucose were used. With acid hydrolysates growth, amino acid production and sugar consumption were delayed and slower as compared to media with blends of pure arabinose, xylose, and glucose. The ethambutol-triggered production of up to 93 ± 4 mM L-glutamate by the wild type-derived pentose-utilizing recombinant and the production of up to 42 ± 2 mM L-lysine by the recombinant pentose-utilizing lysine producer on media containing acid rice straw or wheat bran hydrolysate as carbon and energy source revealed that acid hydrolysates of agricultural waste materials may provide an alternative feedstock for large-scale amino acid production."

"22214592","abstracttext","We used gametocidal (Gc) chromosomes 2C and 3C(SAT) to dissect barley 2H added to common wheat. The Gc chromosome induces chromosomal breakage resulting in chromosomal aberrations in the progeny of the 2H addition line of common wheat carrying the monosomic Gc chromosome. We conducted in situ hybridization to select plants carrying structurally rearranged aberrant 2H chromosomes and characterized them by sequential C-banding and in situ hybridization. We established 66 dissection lines of common wheat carrying single aberrant 2H chromosomes. The aberrant 2H chromosomes were of either deletion or translocation or complicated structural change. Their breakpoints were distributed in the short arm (2HS), centromere (2HC) and the long arm (2HL) at a rough 2HS/2HC/2HL ratio of 2:1:2. We conducted PCR analysis of the 66 dissection lines using 115 EST markers specific to chromosome 2H. Based on the PCR result, we constructed a physical or cytological map of chromosome 2H that were divided into 34 regions separated by the breakpoints of the aberrant 2H chromosomes. Forty-seven markers were present in 2HS and 68 in 2HL. We compared the 2H cytological map with a previously reported 2H genetic map using 44 markers that were used in common to construct both maps. The order of markers in the distal region was the same on both maps but that in the proximal region was somewhat contradictory between the two maps. We found that the markers distributed rather evenly in the genetic map were actually concentrated in the distal regions of both arms as revealed by the cytological map. We also recognized an EST-marker or gene-rich region in the 2HL interstitial region slightly to the telomere."

"22370744","abstracttext","To better understand genome structure and the expression of α/β-gliadin multigenes in hexaploid wheat, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones containing α/β-gliadin genes from the three loci, Gli-A2, Gli-B2, and Gli-D2, were screened. Based on their restriction fragment patterns, we selected five BAC clones, namely, two clones for Gli-A2, two clones for Gli-B2, and one clone for Gli-D2, to fully sequence. Approximately 200 kb was sequenced for each locus. In total, twelve α/β-gliadin intact genes and four pseudogenes were found, and retrotransposons or other transposons existed in each BAC clone. Dot-plot analysis revealed the pattern of genome segmental duplication within each BAC. We calculated time since duplication of each set of α/β-gliadin genes and insertion of retrotransposons. Duplication of all adjacent genes within the same BAC clone took place before or after allotetrapolyploidization, but duplication of certain genes occurred before diploid differentiation of wheat species. Retrotransposons were also inserted before and after the segmental duplication events. Furthermore, translocation of α/β-gliadin genes from chromosomes 1 to 6 apparently occurred before the diversification of various wheat genomes. Duplication of genome segments containing α/β-gliadin genes and retrotransposons were brought about through unequal crossing-over or saltatory replication and α/β-gliadin genes per se were duplicated without any recombination events. Out of twelve intact α/β-gliadin genes detected from their sequences, nine were expressed, although their patterns of expression were distinct. Since they have similar cis-elements and promoter structures, the mechanisms underlying their distinct gene expression and possible applications are discussed."

"22433076","abstracttext","Tolerance mechanisms to salinity and drought stress are quite complex. Plants have developed a complex and elaborate signaling network that ensures their adaptation to this stress. For example, salinity tolerance is thought to be due to three main factors: Na(+) exclusion, tolerance to Na(+) in the tissues and osmotic tolerance. Recently, many transcription factors for tolerance to salt and drought stresses have been identified. In this study, multialignments of conserved domains in DREB1, WRKY1 transcription factors (TFs), and HKT-1 have been utilized to design specific primers in order to identify functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These primers have been used to probe on several genotypes of durum wheat that are differentially tolerant to salt and drought stress; they were grown in increasing concentrations of NaCl. The selected portions have been analyzed using high-resolution melting curve (HRM) technology that currently represents one of the most recent and powerful tools for detecting SNP and INDEL mutations. Analyzing the amplification profiles, observed in the resulting melting curves, samples corresponding to different treatment conditions were selected, sequenced, and aligned with the homolog sequences present in gene databases to identify and characterize potential SNP and INDEL mutations. The PCR amplicons, containing single and double SNPs, produced distinctive HRM profiles. By sequencing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, several SNPs have been identified and validated. All the discovered mutations were able to generate changes in amino acid sequences of the corresponding proteins. Most of the identified SNPs were found in salt and drought tolerant durum wheat genotypes. These varieties are of great value for durum wheat breeding works."

However, in 2012, reports indicated that this valuable resistance may now have been compromised. To characterise stripe rust resistance in Claire and determine which genes may still confer effective resistance a cross was made between Claire and the stripe rust susceptible cultivar Lemhi. A genetic linkage map, constructed using SSR, AFLP, DArT and NBS-AFLP markers had a total map length of 1,730 cM. To improve the definition of two quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified on the long arm of chromosome 2D further markers were developed from wheat EST. Stripe rust resistance was evaluated on adult plants under field and glasshouse conditions by measuring the extent of fungal growth and sporulation, percentage infection (Pi) and the necrotic/chlorotic responses of the plant to infection, infection type (IT). Four QTL contributing to stripe rust adult plant resistance (APR) were identified in Claire, QYr.niab-2D.1, QYr.niab-2D.2, QYr.niab-2B and QYr.niab-7B. For Pi QYr.niab-2D.1 explained up to 25.4 % of the phenotypic variation, QYr.niab-2D.2 up to 28.7 %, QYr.niab-2B up to 21.7 % and QYr.niab-7B up to 13.0 %. For IT the percentages of phenotypic variation explained were 23.4, 31.8, 17.2 and 12.6 %, respectively.

"24679076","abstracttext","Here, we conducted the first large-scale leaf phosphoproteome analysis of two bread wheat cultivars by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Altogether, 1802 unambiguous phosphorylation sites representing 1175 phosphoproteins implicated in various molecular functions and cellular processes were identified by gene ontology enrichment analysis. Among the 1175 phosphoproteins, 141 contained 3-10 phosphorylation sites. The phosphorylation sites were located more frequently in the N- and C-terminal regions than in internal regions, and ∼70% were located outside the conserved regions. Conservation analysis showed that 90.5% of the phosphoproteins had phosphorylated orthologs in other plant species. Eighteen significantly enriched phosphorylation motifs, of which six were new wheat phosphorylation motifs, were identified. In particular, 52 phosphorylated transcription factors (TFs), 85 protein kinases (PKs), and 16 protein phosphatases (PPs) were classified and analyzed in depth. All the Tyr phosphorylation sites were in PKs such as mitogen-activated PKs (MAPKs) and SHAGGY-like kinases. A complicated cross-talk phosphorylation regulatory network based on PKs such as Snf1-related kinases (SnRKs), calcium-dependent PKs (CDPKs), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) and PPs including PP2C, PP2A, and BRI1 suppressor 1 (BSU1)-like protein (BSL) was constructed and was found to be potentially involved in rapid leaf growth.

To unravel the plant actions in response to various environmental factors, identification of stress related miRNAs is essential. For understanding the regulatory behaviour of various abiotic stresses and miRNAs in wheat genotype C-306, we examined expression profile of selected conserved miRNAs viz. miR159, miR164, miR168, miR172, miR393, miR397, miR529 and miR1029 tangled in adapting osmotic, salt and cold stresses. The investigation revealed that two miRNAs (miR168, miR397) were down-regulated and miR172 was up-regulated under all the stress conditions. However, miR164 and miR1029 were up-regulated under cold and osmotic stresses in contrast to salt stress. miR529 responded to cold alone and does not change under osmotic and salt stress. miR393 showed up-regulation under osmotic and salt, and down-regulation under cold stress indicating auxin based differential cold response. Variation in expression level of studied miRNAs in presence of target genes delivers a likely elucidation of miRNAs based abiotic stress regulation. In addition, we reported new stress induced miRNAs Ta-miR855 using computational approach. Results revealed first documentation that miR855 is regulated by salinity stress in wheat. These findings indicate that diverse miRNAs were responsive to osmotic, salt and cold stress and could function in wheat response to abiotic stresses."
"23975011","articletitle","Process of aerenchyma formation and reactive oxygen species induced by waterlogging in wheat seminal roots."
"23975011","abstracttext","The development and regulation of aerenchyma in waterlogged conditions were studied in the seminal roots of wheat. Evans blue staining and the first cell death position indicated that the cortical cell death began at the root mid-cortex cells in flooding conditions. Continuous waterlogging treatment caused the spread of cell death from the mid-cortex to the neighboring cells and well-developed aerenchyma was formed after 72 h. Meanwhile, the formation of radial oxygen loss barrier was observed in the exodermis owing to the induction of Casparian bands and lignin deposition. Analysis of aerenchyma along the wheat root revealed that aerenchyma formed at 10 mm from the root tip, significantly increased toward the center of the roots, and decreased toward the basal region of the root. In situ detection of radial oxygen species (ROS) showed that ROS accumulation started in the mid-cortex cells, where cell death began indicating that cell death was probably accompanied by ROS production. Further waterlogging treatments resulted in the accumulation of ROS in the cortical cells, which were the zone for aerenchyma development. Accumulation and distribution of H₂O₂ at the subcellular level were revealed by ultracytochemical localization, which further verified the involvement of ROS in the cortical cell death process (i.e., aerenchyma formation). Furthermore, gene expression analysis indicated that ROS production might be the result of up-regulation of genes encoding for ROS-producing enzymes and the down-regulation of genes encoding for ROS-detoxifying enzymes. These results suggest that aerenchyma development in wheat roots starts in the mid-cortex cells and its formation is regulated by ROS."

"23918064","abstracttext","Freezing tolerance and winter hardiness are complex traits. In the Triticeae, two loci on the group 5 chromosome homoeologs are repeatedly identified as having major effects on these traits. Recently, we found that segments of the genomic region at one of these loci, Frost resistance-2 (Fr-2) is copy number variable in barley. Freezing-tolerant winter-hardy genotypes have greater tandem copy numbers of the genomic region encompassing the C-repeat binding factor genes Cbf2A and Cbf4B at Fr-H2 than the less freezing-tolerant nonwinter-hardy genotypes. Here we report that in wheat the Cbf14 gene at Fr-2 is copy number variable. Using DNA blot hybridizations, we estimated copy numbers of Cbf14 across the different genomes of diploid and polyploid wheat. Copy numbers of Cbf14 are lower in the B genome than in the A and D genomes across all ploidy levels. Among hexaploid red wheats, winter genotypes harbor greater Cbf14 copy numbers than spring genotypes. Cbf14 copy numbers also vary across the red winter wheats such that hard wheats harbor greater copy numbers than soft wheats. Analysis of hexaploid wheat chromosome 5 substitution lines indicates that Cbf14 copy numbers in the introgressions are stable in the different backgrounds. Taken together our data suggest that higher copy number states existed in the diploid wild ancestors prior to the polyploidization events and that the loss of Cbf14 copies occurred in the cultivated germplasm."

"24178114","abstracttext","Rye chromosomes of wheat-rye addition lines were successfully identified by means of an RFLP analysis with 30 probes. Our results are in agreement with previous cytological data concerning the identity of lines F (+1R), D (+2R), C (+3R), A (+4R), E (+5R) and B (+7R). Two categories of chromosomal rearrangements have been distinguished, namely: (1) deletions: the current line D possesses a chromosome 2R deleted on its short arm and the line G a chromosome 3R deleted on its long arm; we have also noticed a deletion on the long arm of wheat chromosome 1A in line F61; and (2) evolutionary reciprocal translocations in rye relative to wheat which have been previously mentioned in the literature. The anther culture response of the different lines was studied. A significant difference between 'FEC 28' and the addition lines was observed for embryo production and plant regeneration. It appears that genes located on 'S 10' chromosome arm 3RL and on 'FEC 28' chromosome arm 1AL increase embryo frequency whereas gene(s) located on 'S 10' chromosome 5R reduce(s) it. Plant regeneration results suggest that genes increasing regeneration ability and green-plant frequency are located on 'S 10' chromosome 4R. The long arm of chromosome 1A seems to be involved positively in green-plant regeneration whereas chromosomes 1R and 3R limit plant regeneration."

"24446340","abstracttext","To understand the relationships between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the waxy gene and starch parameters in common rye, we performed sequence characterization, enzyme activity testing, amylopectin/amylose ratio evaluation, starch property testing, and correlation analysis. Specific primers were used to clone waxy from 20 rye cultivars. Sequence analysis showed that waxy was 2852 bp, including 11 exons, and sequence similarity across the 20 cultivars was over 98%. The Waxy protein showed >95% similarity with those from wheat, rice, and barley, the closest genetic relationship being with wheat Wx-A type. Waxy had multiple SNPs, most of which were located in the exons. Amino acid variants were found to be mainly distributed in the catalytic domain in an imbalanced state. Multi-factor correlation analysis revealed significant correlation among starch pasting parameters in rye flour. The Waxy protein activity was significantly negatively correlated with the amylose content and amylopectin/amylose ratio. However, pasting parameters, Waxy enzyme activity, and amylopectin/amylose content ratio were not correlated. The correlation of SNPs, the key catalytic site of Waxy, with starch parameters and enzyme activity suggested that both starch pasting parameters and Waxy protein activity were influenced by No. 260 amino acid (aa). Further, the 141 and 152 aa loci were found in the enzyme-catalyzing domain of Waxy. Interestingly, Waxy enzyme activity was also influenced by the 363 aa locus in the pliable region. These results provide important theoretical regarding the high-throughput quality identification of noodle starch, functional studies, directional selection, and molecular markers of wheat Wx subunits."

"24349074","abstracttext","Greening of etiolated plants is predominantly stimulated by light but the complete molecular mechanism is still unknown. Multiple studies currently focus on the important physiological effects of heme oxygenase (HO)/carbon monoxide (CO) in plants. In this report, firstly, the role of HO/CO in light-induced de-etiolation process was investigated. We discovered that light could significantly increase HO activities, HO-1 gene expression, CO release, and chlorophyll accumulation, all of which were sensitive to zinc protoporphyrin (ZnPPIX), the potent inhibitor of HO-1, respectively. Both HO-1 inducer hematin (H) and CO aqueous solution were able to relieve etiolation in wheat seedling leaves under completely darkness by up-regulating endogenous HO/CO system, so as nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP) did. Similarly, endogenous NO production was also boost in response to light, SNP, hematin and CO aqueous solution in wheat seedling leaves. Additionally, the restoration of chlorophyll contents was blocked, when the inhibitor of mammalian nitric oxide synthase N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methylester hydrochloride (L-NAME) or the specific scavenger of NO 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4, 4, 5, 5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium salt (cPTIO) was added, respectively. Furthermore, the inducible effects of light were different from those of SNP, hematin, and CO on Pfr accumulation and PHYA transcripts. However, all of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), hematin, and CO could accelerate NO emission, which suggested that HO/CO in wheat seedlings de-etiolation under dark-light transition may have a cross talk with NO."

"24276440","abstracttext","Genetic studies of frost resistance were performed on various wheat varieties using diallel, F2 monosomic and substitution analysis.A six-parental cross including reciprocals was carried out, and F1 hybrids and their parents were used for the freezing tests under controlled conditions. Both the general combining ability (GCA) and the specific combining ability (SCA) were significant, indicating additive and non-additive gene action in the inheritance of frost resistance. The high GCA∶SCA ratio revealed a preponderance of additive genetic variance. No significant reciprocal differences were found between the reciprocal crosses. The variance/covariance graphical analysis indicated the partial dominance of frost sensitivity. Frost sensitive varieties had the largest number of dominant genes, while frost resistant varieties had the highest proportion of recessive genes. The magnitude of the additive component of variation was higher than that of the dominance component, and the overall measure of the degree of dominance was smaller than one, so average dominance is incomplete. The increasing and decreasing alleles are not equally frequent at all loci. In this set of wheat varieties the values of narrow and broad heritability are relatively high.F2 monosomic analysis of the winter wheat variety 'Arthur' crossed with the monosomics of 'Chinese Spring' revealed that the average frost resistance of all the 21 monosomics was lower than that of the disomic. F2 monosomic hybrids 5A, 2B, 4B and 5D proved to be relatively frost resistant, while monosomics 3A, 3B and 6D were the most sensitive.The control of frost resistance in the set of chromosome substitution lines of the variety 'Cheyenne' into 'Chinese Spring' (with the exception of 2B) indicated that the genes responsible for the frost resistance of 'Cheyenne' are localised in chromosomes 5A, 7A, 4B, 5B, 4D and 5D.The genetic basis of frost resistance and problems of analysis are discussed."

"24278131","abstracttext","Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation is an extremely complex and evolved process involving genetic determinants of both the bacteria and the host plant cells. However, the mechanism of the determinants remains obscure, especially in some cereal crops such as wheat, which is recalcitrant for Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were analyzed in wheat callus cells co-cultured with Agrobacterium by using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS). A set of 4,889 DEGs and 90 DEPs were identified, respectively. Most of them are related to metabolism, chromatin assembly or disassembly and immune defense. After comparative analysis, 24 of the 90 DEPs were detected in RNA-seq and proteomics datasets simultaneously. In addition, real-time RT-PCR experiments were performed to check the differential expression of the 24 genes, and the results were consistent with the RNA-seq data. According to gene ontology (GO) analysis, we found that a big part of these differentially expressed genes were related to the process of stress or immunity response. Several putative determinants and candidate effectors responsive to Agrobacterium mediated transformation of wheat cells were discussed. We speculate that some of these genes are possibly related to Agrobacterium infection. Our results will help to understand the interaction between Agrobacterium and host cells, and may facilitate developing efficient transformation strategies in cereal crops."

"24299032","abstracttext","Fimbrin is an actin-bundling protein found in intestinal microvilli, hair cell stereocilia and fibroblast filopodia. Its homologue Sac6p has been shown to play a critical role in endocytosis and diverse cellular processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. FgFim from the wheat scab pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum strain Y2021A, which is highly resistant to the fungicide JS399-19, was identified by screening a mutant library generated by HPH-HSV-tk cassette-mediated integration. The functions of FgFim were evaluated by constructing a deletion mutant of FgFim, designated ΔFgFim-15. The deletion mutant exhibited a reduced rate of mycelial growth, reduced conidiation, delayed conidium germination, irregularly shaped hyphae, a lack of sexual reproduction on autoclaved wheat kernels and a dramatic decrease in resistance to JS399-19. ΔFgFim-15 also exhibited increased sensitivity to diverse metal cations, to agents that induce osmotic stress and oxidative stress, and to agents that damage the cell membrane and cell wall. Pathogenicity assays showed that the virulence of the FgFim deletion mutant on flowering wheat heads was impaired, which was consistent with its reduced production of the toxin deoxynivalenol in host tissue. All of these defects were restored by genetic complementation of the mutant with the parental FgFim gene. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays showed that the basal expression of three Cyp51 genes, which encode sterol 14α-demethylase, was significantly lower in the mutant than in the parental strain. The results of this study indicate that FgFim plays a critical role in the regulation of resistance to JS399-19 and in various cellular processes in F. graminearum."

"24363037","abstracttext","Dehydrins (DHNs), which are stress-related proteins, are important for plant survival under various abiotic and biotic stresses. To elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of wheat-derived DHNs under these stresses, we characterized the DHN wzy2 promoter of the wheat cultivar Zhengyin 1 and studied its contribution to stress tolerance. Sequence analysis indicated that the wzy2 gene contains one 109-bp intron inserted in the nucleotide sequence encoding the S-motif and characterized by a GT-AG border. The wzy2 promoter was revealed to contain several potential stress-related cis-acting regulatory elements, including elements responsive to abscisic acid (ABA; ABREs), anoxia (GC motifs), low temperature (LTREs), auxin (TGA elements), methyl jasmonate (MeJA; TGACG motifs), and gibberellin (TATC boxes). Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that transcript accumulation occurred in response to low temperature, anoxia, indoleacetic acid, MeJA, ABA, and gibberellin (GA) treatments. Histochemical analysis of GUS expression demonstrated that wzy2 promoter activity could be upregulated by low temperature, anoxia, ABA, and GA treatments. Interestingly, wzy2 promoter element-driven β-glucuronidase expression was first observed in meristemoids rather than calli of wheat seeds subjected to anoxia. Taken together, these results indicate that YSK2-type wzy2 can be induced directly by ABA, low temperature, anoxia, and GA treatments and indirectly by drought, implying that different cis-acting elements interact in stress response cross talk."
"24961368","articletitle","Phytochrome C plays a major role in the acceleration of wheat flowering under long-day photoperiod."
"24961368","abstracttext","Phytochromes are dimeric proteins that function as red and far-red light sensors influencing nearly every phase of the plant life cycle. Of the three major phytochrome families found in flowering plants, phytochrome C (PHYC) is the least understood. In Arabidopsis and rice, PHYC is unstable and functionally inactive unless it heterodimerizes with another phytochrome. However, when expressed in an Arabidopsis phy-null mutant, wheat PHYC forms signaling active homodimers that translocate into the nucleus in red light to mediate photomorphogenic responses. Tetraploid wheat plants homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in all PHYC copies (phyC(AB)) flower on average 108 d later than wild-type plants under long days but only 19 d later under short days, indicating a strong interaction between PHYC and photoperiod. This interaction is further supported by the drastic down-regulation in the phyC(AB) mutant of the central photoperiod gene photoperiod 1 (PPD1) and its downstream target flowering locus T1, which are required for the promotion of flowering under long days. These results implicate light-dependent, PHYC-mediated activation of PPD1 expression in the acceleration of wheat flowering under inductive long days. Plants homozygous for the phyC(AB) mutations also show altered profiles of circadian clock and clock-output genes, which may also contribute to the observed differences in heading time. Our results highlight important differences in the photoperiod pathways of the temperate grasses with those of well-studied model plant species."

"24895618","abstracttext","For map-based cloning of genes conferring important traits in the hexaploid wheat line 92R137, a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, including two sublibraries, was constructed using the genomic DNA of 92R137 digested with restriction enzymes HindIII and BamHI. The BAC library was composed of total 765,696 clones, of which 390,144 were from the HindIII digestion and 375,552 from the BamHI digestion. Through pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of 453 clones randomly selected from the HindIII sublibrary and 573 clones from the BamHI sublibrary, the average insert sizes were estimated as 129 and 113 kb, respectively. Thus, the HindIII sublibrary was estimated to have a 3.01-fold coverage and the BamHI sublibrary a 2.53-fold coverage based on the estimated hexaploid wheat genome size of 16,700 Mb. The 765,696 clones were arrayed in 1,994 384-well plates. All clones were also arranged into plate pools and further arranged into 5-dimensional (5D) pools. The probability of identifying a clone corresponding to any wheat DNA sequence (such as gene Yr26 for stripe rust resistance) from the library was estimated to be more than 99.6%. Through polymerase chain reaction screening the 5D pools with Xwe173, a marker tightly linked to Yr26, six BAC clones were successfully obtained. These results demonstrate that the BAC library is a valuable genomic resource for positional cloning of Yr26 and other genes of interest."

"24813914","abstracttext","Electrochemical genosensors are becoming cost-effective miniaturizable alternatives to real-time PCR (RT-PCR) methods for the detection of sequence-specific DNA fragments. We report on the rapid detection of PCR amplicons without the need of purification or strand separation. A challenging target sequence for both PCR amplification and electrochemical detection allowed us to address some difficulties associated to hybridization on electrode surfaces. The target was a highly specific oligonucleotide sequence of wheat encoding the most immunogenic peptide of gliadin that triggers the immune response of celiac disease (CD), the 33-mer. With a sandwich assay format and a rational design of the capture and tagged-signaling probes the problems posed by the strong secondary structure of the target and complementary probes were alleviated. Using a binary self-assembled monolayer and enzymatic amplification, a limit of detection of 0.3 nM was obtained. The genosensor did not respond to other gluten-containing cereals such as rye and barley. Coupling to PCR to analyze wheat flour samples required tailoring both the capture and signaling probes. This is the first time that deleterious steric hindrance from long single-stranded regions adjacent to the electrode surface is reported for relatively short amplicons (less than 200 bp). The importance of the location of the recognition site within the DNA sequence is discussed. Since the selected gene fragment contains several repetitions of short sequences, a careful optimization of the PCR conditions had to be performed to circumvent the amplification of non-specific fragments from wheat flour."

"25112204","abstracttext_key message","We detected several, most likely novel QTL for adult plant resistance to rusts. Notably three QTL improved resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust simultaneously indicating broad spectrum resistance QTL. The rusts of wheat (Puccinia spp.) are destructive fungal wheat diseases. The deployment of resistant cultivars plays a central role in integrated rust disease management. Durability of resistance would be preferred, but is difficult to analyse. The Austrian winter wheat cultivar Capo was released in the 1989 and grown on a large acreage during more than two decades and maintained a good level of quantitative leaf rust and stripe rust resistance. Two bi-parental mapping populations: Capo × Arina and Capo × Furore were tested in multiple environments for severity of leaf rust and stripe rust at the adult plant stage in replicated field experiments. Quantitative trait loci associated with leaf rust and stripe rust severity were mapped using DArT and SSR markers. Five QTL were detected in multiple environments associated with resistance to leaf rust designated as QLr.ifa-2AL, QLr.ifa-2BL, QLr.ifa-2BS, QLr.ifa-3BS, and QLr.ifa-5BL, and five for resistance to stripe rust QYr.ifa-2AL, QYr.ifa-2BL, QYr.ifa-3AS, QYr.ifa-3BS, and QYr.ifa-5A. For all QTL apart from two (QYr.ifa-3AS, QLr.ifa-5BL) Capo contributed the resistance improving allele. The leaf rust and stripe rust resistance QTL on 2AL, 2BL and 3BS mapped to the same chromosome positions, indicating either closely linked genes or pleiotropic gene action. These three multiple disease resistance QTL (QLr.ifa-2AL/QYr.ifa-2AL, QLr.ifa.2BL/QYr.ifa-2BL, QLr.ifa-3BS/QYr.ifa.3BS) potentially contribute novel resistance sources for stripe rust and leaf rust. The long-lasting resistance of Capo apparently rests upon a combination of several genes. The described germplasm, QTL and markers are applicable for simultaneous resistance improvement against leaf rust and stripe rust."

The wheat line contains both types of starch granules while the Aegilops line only has the A-type. Differential starch granule development patterns of these two species were observed at the morphological level. A total of 190 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were detected between the two lines based on 2-D electrophoresis, among which 119 DEPs were identified, representing 13 unique proteins. Gene ontology annotation analysis indicated that both molecular functions and biological processes of the identified proteins are highly conserved. Different phosphorylation modification levels between the A- and B-type starch granules were found. Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed that a number of key genes including starch synthase I-1, pullulanase, isoamylase and starch branching enzyme IIa were differentially expressed between the two species. Our results demonstrated that the large granule size is associated with higher activities of multiple starch biosynthesis enzymes.

"26106823","abstracttext","Wheat is an important crop in the world. But most of the cultivars are salt sensitive, and often adversely affected by salt stress. WRKY transcription factors play a major role in plant responses to salt stress, but the effective salinity regulatory WRKYs identified in bread wheat are limited and the mechanism of salt stress tolerance is also not well explored. Here, we identified a salt (NaCl) induced class II WRKY transcription factor TaWRKY93. Its transcript level was strongly induced by salt (NaCl) and exogenous abscisic acid (ABA). Over-expression of TaWRKY93 in Arabidopsis thaliana enhanced salt (NaCl), drought, low temperature and osmotic (mannitol) stress tolerance, mainly demonstrated by transgenic plants forming longer primary roots or more lateral roots on MS plates supplemented with NaCl and mannitol individually, higher survival rate under drought and low temperature stress. Further, transgenic plants maintained a more proline content, higher relative water content and less electrolyte leakage than the wild type plants. The transcript abundance of a series of abiotic stress-related genes was up-regulated in the TaWRKY93 transgenic plants. In summary, TaWRKY93 is a new positive regulator of abiotic stress, it may increase salinity, drought and low temperature stress tolerance through enhancing osmotic adjustment, maintaining membrane stability and increasing transcription of stress related genes, and contribute to the superior agricultural traits of SR3 through promoting root development. It can be used as a candidate gene for wheat transgenic engineering breeding against abiotic stress."

D. noxia has the most AT-rich insect genome sequenced to date (70.9%), with a bimodal CpG(O/E) distribution and a complete set of methylation related genes. The D. noxia genome displays a widespread, extensive reduction in the number of genes per ortholog group, including defensive, detoxification, chemosensory, and sugar transporter groups in comparison to the Acyrthosiphon pisum genome, including a 65% reduction in chemoreceptor genes. Thirty of 34 known D. noxia salivary genes were found in this assembly. These genes exhibited less homology with those salivary genes commonly expressed in insect saliva, such as glucose dehydrogenase and trehalase, yet greater conservation among genes that are expressed in D. noxia saliva but not detected in the saliva of other insects.

The tall Indian bread wheat cultivar Sujata displays high and low infection types to leaf rust and stripe rust, respectively, at the seedling stage in greenhouse tests. It was also highly resistant to both rusts at adult plant stage in field trials in Mexico. The genetic basis of this resistance was investigated in a population of 148 F5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross Avocet × Sujata. The parents and RIL population were characterized in field trials for resistance to leaf rust during 2011 at El Batán, and 2012 and 2013 at Ciudad Obregón, Mexico, and for stripe rust during 2011 and 2012 at Toluca, Mexico; they were also characterized three times for stripe rust at seedling stage in the greenhouse. The RILs were genotyped with diversity arrays technology and simple sequence repeat markers. The final genetic map was constructed with 673 polymorphic markers. Inclusive composite interval mapping analysis detected two new significant co-located resistance loci, QLr.cim-1AS/QYr.cim-1AS and QLr.cim-7BL/YrSuj, on chromosomes 1AS and 7BL, respectively. The chromosomal position of QLr.cim-7BL overlapped with the seedling stripe rust resistance gene, temporarily designated as YrSuj. Two previously reported pleiotropic adult plant resistance genes, Lr46/Yr29 and Lr67/Yr46, and a new leaf rust resistance quantitative trait loci derived from Avocet were also mapped in the population.

"26217355","abstracttext","Necrotrophic diseases of wheat cause major losses in most wheat growing areas of world. Tan spot (caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis) and septoria nodorum blotch (SNB; Parastagonospora nodorum) have been shown to reduce yields by 10-20% across entire agri-ecological zones despite the application of fungicides and a heavy focus over the last 30 years on resistance breeding. Efforts by breeders to improve the resistance of cultivars has been compromised by the universal finding that resistance was quantitative and governed by multiple quantitative trait loci (QTL). Most QTL had a limited effect that was hard to measure precisely and varied significantly from site to site and season to season. The discovery of necrotrophic effectors has given breeding for disease resistance new methods and tools. In the case of tan spot in West Australia, a single effector, PtrToxA and its recogniser gene Tsn1, has a dominating impact in disease resistance. The delivery of ToxA to breeders has had a major impact on cultivar choice and breeding strategies. For P. nodorum, three effectors - SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 - have been well characterized. Unlike tan spot, no one effector has a dominating role. Genetic analysis of various mapping populations and pathogen isolates has shown that different effectors have varying impact and that epistatic interactions also occur. As a result of these factors the deployment of these effectors for SNB resistance breeding is more complex. We have deleted the three effectors in a strain of P. nodorum and measured effector activity and disease potential of the triple knockout mutant. The culture filtrate causes necrosis in several cultivars and the strain causes disease, albeit the overall levels are less than in the wild type. Modeling of the field disease resistance scores of cultivars from their reactions to the microbially expressed effectors SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3 is significantly improved by including the response to the triple knockout mutant culture filtrate. This indicates that one or more further effectors are secreted into the culture filtrate. We conclude that the in vitro-secreted necrotrophic effectors explain a very large part of the disease response of wheat germplasm and that this method of resistance breeding promises to further reduce the impact of these globally significant diseases."

There were totally 2713 and 2485 probe sets displayed expression changes more than 1.5-fold in Tongzhou916 and Shiluan02-1, respectively. Low-K(+) responsive genes mainly belonged to the categories as follows: metabolic process, cation binding, transferase activity, ion transporters and so forth. We made a comparison of gene expression differences between the two wheat genotypes. There were 1321 and 1177 up-regulated genes in Tongzhou916 and Shiluan02-1, respectively. This result indicated that more genes took part in acclimating to low-K(+) stress in Tongzhou916. In addition, there were more genes associated with jasmonic acid, defense response and potassium transporter up-regulated in Tongzhou916. Moreover, totally 19 genes encoding vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase, ethylene-related, auxin response, anatomical structure development and nutrient reservoir were uniquely up-regulated in Tongzhou916. For their important role in root architecture, K(+) uptake and nutrient storage, unique genes above may make a great contribution to the strong low-K(+) tolerance in Tongzhou916."

TaOPR2 was mapped to wheat chromosome 7B and located on peroxisome. Protein evolution analysis revealed that TaOPR2 belongs to the OPRⅡ subgroup and shares a high degree of identity with other higher plant OPR proteins. The quantitative real-time PCR results indicated that the expression of TaOPR2 is inhibited by abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), gibberellic acid (GA3), low temperatures and high salinity. In contrast, the expression of TaOPR2 can be induced by wounding, drought and methyl jasmonate (MeJA). Furthermore, the transcription level of TaOPR2 increased after infection with Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici and Puccinia recondite f. sp. tritici. TaOPR2 has NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase activity. In addition, the constitutive expression of TaOPR2 can rescue the male sterility phenotype of Arabidopsis mutant opr3. These results suggest that TaOPR2 is involved in the biosynthesis of jasmonic acid (JA) in wheat."

"27191600","abstracttext","In a number of crop species hybrids are able to outperform line varieties. The anthers of the autogamous bread wheat plant are normally extruded post anthesis, a trait which is unfavourable for the production of F1 hybrid grain. Higher anther extrusion (AE) promotes cross fertilization for more efficient hybrid seed production. Therefore, this study aimed at the genetic dissection of AE by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and determination of the main effect QTL. We applied GWAS approach to identify DArT markers potentially linked to AE to unfold its genetic basis in a panel of spring wheat accessions. Phenotypic data were collected for three years and best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) values were calculated across all years. The extent of the AE correlation between growing years and BLUE values ranged from r = +0.56 (2013 vs 2015) to 0.91 (2014 vs BLUE values). The broad sense heritability was 0.84 across all years. Six accessions displayed stable AE >80% across all the years. Genotyping data included 2,575 DArT markers (with minimum of 0.05 minor allele frequency applied). AE was influenced both by genotype and by the growing environment. In all, 131 significant marker trait associations (MTAs) (|log10 (P)| >FDR) were established for AE. AE behaved as a quantitative trait, with five consistently significant markers (significant across at least two years with a significant BLUE value) contributing a minor to modest proportion (4.29% to 8.61%) of the phenotypic variance and affecting the trait either positively or negatively. For this reason, there is potential for breeding for improved AE by gene pyramiding. The consistently significant markers linked to AE could be helpful for marker assisted selection to transfer AE to high yielding varieties allowing to promote the exploitation of hybrid-heterosis in the key crop wheat."

"27402868","abstracttext","Proteomic approaches were applied to identify protein spots involved in cold responses in wheat. By comparing the differentially accumulated proteins from two cultivars (UC1110 and PI 610750) and their derivatives, as well as the F10 recombinant inbred line population differing in cold-tolerance, a total of 20 common protein spots representing 16 unique proteins were successfully identified using 2-DE method. Of these, 14 spots had significantly enhanced abundance in the cold-sensitive parental cultivar UC1110 and its 20 descendant lines when compared with the cold-tolerant parental cultivar PI 610750 and its 20 descendant lines. Six protein spots with reduced abundance were also detected. The identified protein spots are involved in stress/defense, carbohydrate metabolism, protein metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, energy metabolism, and photosynthesis. The 20 differentially expressed protein spots were chosen for quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to investigate expression changes at the RNA level. The results indicated that the transcriptional expression patterns of 11 genes were consistent with their protein expression models. Among the three unknown proteins, Spot 20 (PAP6-like) showed high sequence similarities with PAP6. qRT-PCR results implied that cold and salt stresses increased the expression of PAP6-like in wheat leaves. Furthermore, VIGS (virus-induced gene silencing)-treated plants generated for PAP6-like were subjected to freezing stress, these plants had more serious droop and wilt, an increased rate of relative electrolyte leakage, reduced relative water content (RWC) and decreased tocopherol levels when compared with viral control plants. However, the plants that were silenced for the other two unknown proteins had no significant differences in comparison to the BSMV0-inoculated plants under freezing conditions. These results indicate that PAP6-like possibly plays an important role in conferring cold tolerance in wheat."

"29117786","abstracttext","The group 1 pathogenesis-related (PR-1) proteins originally identified from plants and their homologs are also found in other eukaryotic kingdoms. Studies on nonplant PR-1-like (PR-1L) proteins have been pursued widely in humans and animals but rarely in filamentous ascomycetes. Here, we report the characterization of four PR-1L proteins identified from the ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum, the primary cause of Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley (designated FgPR-1L). Molecular cloning revealed that the four FgPR-1L proteins are all encoded by small open reading frames (612 to 909 bp) that are often interrupted by introns, in contrast to plant PR-1 genes that lack introns. Sequence analysis indicated that all FgPR-1L proteins contain the PR-1-specific three-dimensional structure, and one of them features a C-terminal transmembrane (TM) domain that has not been reported for any stand-alone PR-1 proteins. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the four FgPR-1L genes are expressed in axenic cultures and in planta with different spatial or temporal expression patterns. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that fungal PR-1L proteins fall into three major groups, one of which harbors FgPR-1L-2-related TM-containing proteins from both phytopathogenic and human-pathogenic ascomycetes. Low-temperature sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and proteolytic assays indicated that the recombinant FgPR-1L-4 protein exists as a monomer and is resistant to subtilisin of the serine protease family. Functional analysis confirmed that deletion of the FgPR-1L-4 gene from the fungal genome results in significantly reduced virulence on susceptible wheat. This study provides the first example that the F. graminearum-wheat interaction involves a pathogen-derived PR-1L protein that affects fungal virulence on the host."
"29188438","articletitle","Mapping causal mutations by exome sequencing in a wheat TILLING population: a tall mutant case study."
"29188438","abstracttext","Forward genetic screens of induced mutant plant populations are powerful tools to identify genes underlying phenotypes of interest. Using traditional techniques, mapping causative mutations from forward screens is a lengthy, multi-step process, requiring the identification of a broad genetic region followed by candidate gene sequencing to characterize the causal variant. Mapping by whole genome sequencing accelerates the identification of causal mutations by simultaneously defining a mapping region and providing information on the induced genetic variants. In wheat, although the availability of a high-quality draft genome assembly facilitates mapping and mutation calling, whole genome resequencing remains prohibitively expensive due to its large genome. In the current study, we used exome sequencing as a complexity reduction strategy to detect mutations associated with a target phenotype. In a segregating wheat EMS population, we identified a clear peak region on chromosome arm 4BS associated with increased plant height. Although none of the significant SNPs seemed causative for the mutant phenotype, they were sufficient to identify a linked ~ 1.9 Mb deletion encompassing nine genes. These genes included Rht-B1, which is known to have a strong effect on plant height and is a strong candidate for the observed phenotype. We performed simulation experiments to determine the impacts of sequencing depth and bulk size and discuss the importance of considering each factor when designing mapping-by-sequencing experiments in wheat. This approach can accelerate the identification of candidate causal point mutations or linked deletions underlying important phenotypes."

"28664519","abstracttext","In this study, we investigate the relationship between γ-PGA productivity and biocontrol capacity of Bacillus subtilis BsE1; one bacterial isolate displayed 62.14% biocontrol efficacy against Fusarium root rot. The γ-PGA yield assay, motility assay, wheat root colonization assay, and biological control assay were analysed in different γ-PGA yield mutants of BsE1. The pgsB (PGA-synthase-CapB gene) deleted mutant of BsE1 reduced γ-PGA yield and exhibited apparent decline of in vitro motile ability. Deletion of pgsB impaired colonizing capacity of BsE1 on wheat root in 30 days, also lowered biocontrol efficacies from 62.08% (wild type BsE1) to 14.22% in greenhouse experiment against Fusarium root rot. The knockout of pgdS and ggt (genes relate to two γ-PGA degrading enzymes) on BsE1, leads to a considerable improvement in polymer yield and biocontrol efficacy, which attains higher level compared with wild type BsE1. Compared with ΔpgsB mutant, defense genes related to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and phytoalexin expressed changes by notable levels on wheat roots treated with BsE1, demonstrating the functional role γ-PGA plays in biocontrol against Fusarium root rot. γ-PGA is not only important to the motile and plant root colonization ability of BsE1, but also essential to the biological control performed by BsE1 against Fusarium root rot. Our goal in this study is to reveals a new perspective of BCAs screening on bacterial isolates, without good performance during pre-assays of antagonism ability."

"28561994","abstracttext","Plant diseases are a serious threat to crop production. The informed use of naturally occurring disease resistance in plant breeding can greatly contribute to sustainably reduce yield losses caused by plant pathogens. The Ta-Lr34res gene encodes an ABC transporter protein and confers partial, durable, and broad spectrum resistance against several fungal pathogens in wheat. Transgenic barley lines expressing Ta-Lr34res showed enhanced resistance against powdery mildew and leaf rust of barley. While Ta-Lr34res is only active at adult stage in wheat, Ta-Lr34res was found to be highly expressed already at the seedling stage in transgenic barley resulting in severe negative effects on growth. Here, we expressed Ta-Lr34res under the control of the pathogen-inducible Hv-Ger4c promoter in barley. Sixteen independent barley transformants showed strong resistance against leaf rust and powdery mildew. Infection assays and growth parameter measurements were performed under standard glasshouse and near-field conditions using a convertible glasshouse. Two Hv-Ger4c::Ta-Lr34res transgenic events were analysed in detail. Plants of one transformation event had similar grain production compared to wild-type under glasshouse and near-field conditions. Our results showed that negative effects caused by constitutive high expression of Ta-Lr34res driven by the endogenous wheat promoter in barley can be eliminated by inducible expression without compromising disease resistance. These data demonstrate that Ta-Lr34res is agronomically useful in barley. We conclude that the generation of a large number of transformants in different barley cultivars followed by early field testing will allow identifying barley lines suitable for breeding."
"27322827","articletitle","The Multifarious PGPR Serratia marcescens CDP-13 Augments Induced Systemic Resistance and Enhanced Salinity Tolerance of Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"27322827","abstracttext","The present study demonstrates the plant growth promoting (PGP) potential of a bacterial isolate CDP-13 isolated from 'Capparis decidua' plant, and its ability to protect plants from the deleterious effect of biotic and abiotic stressors. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, the isolate was identified as Serratia marcescens. Among the PGP traits, the isolate was found to be positive for ACC deaminase activity, phosphate solubilization, production of siderophore, indole acetic acid production, nitrogen fixation, and ammonia production. CDP-13 showed growth at an increased salt (NaCl) concentration of up to 6%, indicating its potential to survive and associate with plants growing in saline soil. The inoculation of S. marcescens enhanced the growth of wheat plant under salinity stress (150-200 mM). It significantly reduced inhibition of plant growth (15 to 85%) caused by salt stressors. Application of CDP-13 also modulated concentration (20 to 75%) of different osmoprotectants (proline, malondialdehyde, total soluble sugar, total protein content, and indole acetic acid) in plants suggesting its role in enabling plants to tolerate salt stressors. In addition, bacterial inoculation also reduced the disease severity caused by fungal infection, which illustrated its ability to confer induced systemic resistance (ISR) in host plants. Treatment of wheat plants with the test organism caused alteration in anti-oxidative enzymes activities (Superoxide dismutase, Catalase, and Peroxidase) under various salinity levels, and therefore minimizes the salinity-induced oxidative damages to the plants. Colonization efficiency of strain CDP-13 was confirmed by CFU count, epi-fluorescence microscopy, and ERIC-PCR-based DNA fingerprinting approach. Hence, the study indicates that bacterium CDP-13 enhances plant growth, and has potential for the amelioration of salinity stress in wheat plants. Likewise, the results also provide insights into biotechnological approaches to using PGPR as an alternative to chemicals and pesticides."

"27536292","abstracttext","Maintaining soil fertility and the microbial communities that determine fertility is critical to sustainable agricultural strategies, and the use of different organic fertilizer (OF) regimes represents an important practice in attempts to preserve soil quality. However, little is known about the dynamic response of bacterial communities to fertilization regimes across crop growth stages. In this study, we examined microbial community structure and diversity across eight representative growth stages of wheat-rice rotation under four different fertilization treatments: no nitrogen fertilizer (NNF), chemical fertilizer (CF), organic-inorganic mixed fertilizer (OIMF), and OF. Quantitative PCR (QPCR) and high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene fragments revealed that growth stage as the best predictor of bacterial community abundance and structure. Additionally, bacterial community compositions differed between wheat and rice rotations. Relative to soils under wheat rotation, soils under rice rotation contained higher relative abundances (RA) of anaerobic and mesophilic microbes and lower RA of aerophilic microbes. With respect to fertilization regime, NNF plots had a higher abundance of nitrogen-fixing Cyanobacteria. OIMF had a lower abundance of ammonia-oxidizing Thaumarchaeota compared with CF. Application of chemical fertilizers (CF and OIMF treatments) significantly increased the abundance of some generally oligotrophic bacteria such those belonging to the Acidobacteria, while more copiotrophic of the phylum Proteobacteria increased with OF application. A high correlation coefficient was found when comparing RA of Acidobacteria based upon QPCR vs. sequence analysis, yet poor correlations were found for the α- and β- Proteobacteria, highlighting the caution required when interpreting these molecular data. In total, crop, fertilization scheme and plant developmental stage all influenced soil microbial community structure, but not total levels of alpha diversity."

"27920787","abstracttext","The interaction of elevated [CO 2 ] and water stress will have an effect on the adaptation of durum wheat to future climate scenarios. For the Mediterranean basin these scenarios include the rising occurrence of water stress during the first part of the crop cycle. In this study, we evaluated the interactive effects of elevated [CO 2 ] and moderate to severe water stress during the first part of the growth cycle on physiological traits and gene expression in four modern durum wheat genotypes. Physiological data showed that elevated [CO 2 ] promoted plant growth but reduced N content. This was related to a down-regulation of Rubisco and N assimilation genes and up-regulation of genes that take part in C-N remobilization, which might suggest a higher N efficiency. Water restriction limited the stimulation of plant biomass under elevated [CO 2 ], especially at severe water stress, while stomatal conductance and carbon isotope signature revealed a water saving strategy. Transcript profiles under water stress suggested an inhibition of primary C fixation and N assimilation. Nevertheless, the interactive effects of elevated [CO 2 ] and water stress depended on the genotype and the severity of the water stress, especially for the expression of drought stress-responsive genes such as dehydrins, catalase, and superoxide dismutase. The network analysis of physiological traits and transcript levels showed coordinated shifts between both categories of parameters and between C and N metabolism at the transcript level, indicating potential genes and traits that could be used as markers for early vigor in durum wheat under future climate change scenarios. Overall the results showed that greater plant growth was linked to an increase in N content and expression of N metabolism-related genes and down-regulation of genes related to the antioxidant system. The combination of elevated [CO 2 ] and severe water stress was highly dependent on the genotypic variability, suggesting specific genotypic adaptation strategies to environmental conditions."

"27933076","abstracttext","Environmental stresses frequently affect plant growth and development, and many genes have been found to be induced by unfavorable environmental conditions. Here, we reported the biological functions of TaNAC2D , a stress-related NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) gene from wheat. TaNAC2D showed transcriptional activator activity in yeast. TaNAC2D-GFP fusion protein was localized in the nucleus of wheat mesophyll protoplasts. TaNAC2D transcript abundance was significantly induced by NaCl, PEG6000, and abscisic acid (ABA) at seedling stage, and repressed by NaCl and PEG6000 at mature plant stage. When TaNAC2D was introduced into Arabidopsis , the 35-day-old soil-grown TaNAC2D -overexpression ( TaNAC2D -OX) plants displayed slower stomatal closure, higher water loss rate, and more sensitivity to salt and drought stresses compared with WT plants. In contrast, TaNAC2D -OX seedlings, grown on 1/2 MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of NaCl, Mannitol, and MV, had enhanced tolerances to salt, osmotic and oxidative stresses during seed germination and post-germination periods. The opposite stress-responsive phenotypes of transgenic Arabidopsis were consistent with the expression patterns of TaNAC2D in wheat. Moreover, under high salinity and dehydration conditions, three marker genes, including NCED3 , RD29A , and RD29B , were down-regulated in 35-day-old TaNAC2D- OX plants grown in soil and up-regulated in 14-day-old TaNAC2D- OX seedlings grown on 1/2 MS medium. Our results suggest that the change in growth stages and environmental conditions may regulate TaNAC2D's function."

"27917186","abstracttext","A panel of 89 local commercial cultivars of bread wheat was tested in field trials in the dry conditions of Northern Kazakhstan. Two distinct groups of cultivars (six cultivars in each group), which had the highest and the lowest grain yield under drought were selected for further experiments. A dehydration test conducted on detached leaves indicated a strong association between rates of water loss in plants from the first group with highest grain yield production in the dry environment relative to the second group. Modern high-throughput Amplifluor Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) technology was applied to study allelic variations in a series of drought-responsive genes using 19 SNP markers. Genotyping of an SNP in the TaDREB5 ( DREB2 -type) gene using the Amplifluor SNP marker KATU48 revealed clear allele distribution across the entire panel of wheat accessions, and distinguished between the two groups of cultivars with high and low yield under drought. Significant differences in expression levels of TaDREB5 were revealed by qRT-PCR. Most wheat plants from the first group of cultivars with high grain yield showed slight up-regulation in the TaDREB5 transcript in dehydrated leaves. In contrast, expression of TaDREB5 in plants from the second group of cultivars with low grain yield was significantly down-regulated. It was found that SNPs did not alter the amino acid sequence of TaDREB5 protein. Thus, a possible explanation is that alternative splicing and up-stream regulation of TaDREB5 may be affected by SNP, but these hypotheses require additional analysis (and will be the focus of future studies)."

"28062009","abstracttext","Feed additives, including prebiotics, are commonly used alternatives to antimicrobial growth promoters to improve gut health and performance in broilers. Wheat bran is a highly concentrated source of (in)soluble fiber which is partly degraded by the gut microbiota. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential of wheat bran as such to reduce colonization of the cecum and shedding of Salmonella bacteria in vivo. Also, the effect of particle size was evaluated. Bran with an average reduced particle size of 280μm decreased levels of cecal Salmonella colonization and shedding shortly after infection when compared to control groups and groups receiving bran with larger particle sizes. In vitro fermentation experiments revealed that bran with smaller particle size was fermented more efficiently, with a significantly higher production of butyric and propionic acid, compared to the control fermentation and fermentation of a larger fraction. Fermentation products derived from bran with an average particle size of 280μm downregulated the expression of hilA, an important invasion-related gene of Salmonella. This downregulation was reflected in an actual lowered invasive potential when Salmonella bacteria were pretreated with the fermentation products derived from the smaller bran fraction. These data suggest that wheat bran with reduced particle size can be a suitable feed additive to help control Salmonella infections in broilers. The mechanism of action most probably relies on a more efficient fermentation of this bran fraction and the consequent increased production of short chain fatty acids (SCFA). Among these SCFA, butyric and propionic acid are known to reduce the invasion potential of Salmonella bacteria."

"29234334","abstracttext","Attention should be devoted to weeds evolving herbicide resistance with non-target-site resistance (NTSR) mechanism due to their unpredictable resistance patterns. Quantification of fitness cost can be used in NTSR management strategies to determine the long-term fate of resistant plants in weed populations. To our knowledge, this is the first report evaluating potential fecundity and vegetative fitness of a NTSR black-grass ( Alopecurus myosuroides Huds), the most important herbicide resistant weed in Europe, with controlled genetic background. The susceptible (S) and NTSR sub-populations were identified and isolated from a fenoxaprop- P -ethyl resistant population by a plant cloning technique. Using a target-neighborhood design, competitive responses of S and NTSR black-grass sub-populations to increasing density of winter wheat were quantified for 2 years in greenhouse and 1 year in field. Fitness traits including potential seed production, vegetative biomass and tiller number of both sub-populations significantly decreased with increasing density of winter wheat. More importantly, no statistically significant differences were found in fitness traits between S and NTSR sub-populations either grown alone (no competition) or in competition with winter wheat. According to the results, the NTSR black-grass is probably to persist in field even in the cessation of fenoxaprop- P -ethyl. So, effective herbicide resistant management strategies are strongly suggested to prevent and stop the spread of the NTSR black-grass, otherwise NTSR loci conferring resistance to a range of herbicides in black-grass will persist in the gene pool even in the absence of herbicide application. Consequently, herbicide as an effective tool for control of black-grass will gradually be lost in fields infested by NTSR black-grass."

"28289804","abstracttext_key message","Recombination at the Glu-3 loci was identified, and strong genetic linkage was observed only between the amplicons representing i-type and s-type genes located, respectively, at the Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 loci. The low-molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GSs) are one of the major components of wheat seed storage proteins and play a critical role in the determination of wheat end-use quality. The genes encoding this class of proteins are located at the orthologous Glu-3 loci (Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3). Due to the complexity of these chromosomal regions and the high sequence similarity between different LMW-GS genes, their organization and recombination characteristics are still incompletely understood. This study examined intralocus recombination at the Glu-3 loci in two recombinant inbred line (RIL) and one doubled haploid (DH) population, all segregating for the Glu-A3, Glu-B3, and Glu-D3 loci. The analysis was conducted using a gene marker system that consists of the amplification of the complete set of the LMW-GS genes and their visualization by capillary electrophoresis. Recombinant marker haplotypes were detected in all three populations with different recombination rates depending on the locus and the population. No recombination was observed between the amplicons representing i-type and s-type LMW-GS genes located, respectively, at the Glu-A3 and Glu-B3 loci, indicating tight linkage between these genes. Results of this study contribute to better understanding the genetic linkage and recombination between different LMW-GS genes, the structure of the Glu-3 loci, and the development of more specific molecular markers that better represent the genetic diversity of these loci. In this way, a more precise analysis of the contribution of various LMW-GSs to end-use quality of wheat may be achieved."

"28250392","abstracttext","Once candidate genes are available, the application of genetic transformation plays a major part to study their function in plants for adaptation to respective environmental stresses, including waterlogging (WL). The introduction of stress-inducible genes into wheat remains difficult because of low transformation and plant regeneration efficiencies and expression variability and instability. Earlier, we found two cDNAs encoding WL stress-responsive wheat pathogenesis-related proteins 1.2 ( TaBWPR-1.2 ), TaBWPR-1.2#2 and TaBWPR-1.2# 13. Using microprojectile bombardment, both cDNAs were introduced into ""Bobwhite"". Despite low transformation efficiency, four independent T₂ homozygous lines for each gene were isolated, where transgenes were ubiquitously and variously expressed. The highest transgene expression was obtained in Ubi: TaBWPR-1.2#2 L#11a and Ubi:TaBWPR-1.2#13 L#4a. Using quantitative proteomics, the root proteins of L#11a were analyzed to explore possible physiological pathways regulated by TaBWPR-1.2 under normal and waterlogged conditions. In L#11a, the abundance of proteasome subunit alpha type-3 decreased under normal conditions, whereas that of ferredoxin precursor and elongation factor-2 increased under waterlogged conditions in comparison with normal plants. Proteomic results suggest that L#11a is one of the engineered wheat plants where TaBWPR-1.2#2 is most probably involved in proteolysis, protein synthesis and alteration in the energy pathway in root tissues via the above proteins in order to gain metabolic adjustment to WL."

To achieve arabinoxylan degradation, the swu62A gene was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and the recombinant enzyme, termed SWUAbf62A, was characterized. The 438 amino acids of SWUAbf62A revealed Glyco_hydro_62 and closely related with putative α-l-arabinofuranosidases belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 62. SWUAbf62A was purified in two steps, Ni-affinity and size-exclusion column chromatographies, and its molecular mass without signal peptide was determined to be 49 kDa. SWUAbf62A showed optimum activity at pH 5.0 and 50 °C, and more than 70% of its initial enzymatic activity remained after incubation at pH 4.1-10.5, while SWUAbf62A lost all activity after 1 h at 60 °C. SWUAbf62A activity was stimulated by Ba 2+ , Ca 2+ , and Mn 2+ and decreased by Ag + , Cu 2+ , Fe 2+ , and EDTA. SWUAbf62A had no activity towards p-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside or p-nitrophenyl-β-d-xylopyranoside synthetic substrates. On the other hand, SWUAbf62A had the highest activity against wheat arabinoxylan, with a specific activity of 1.29 U/mg, and was also active against sugar beet arabinan, with a specific activity of 0.14 U/mg; these results indicated that SWUAbf62A is an arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolase. Using 1 H-NMR analysis, SWUAbf62A was found to release l-arabinofuranoses singly linked to O-3 of wheat arabinoxylan. In addition, SWUAbf62A acted synergistically with endo-xylanase (XynSW3) and α-l-arabinofuranosidase, which releases arabinose linked to O-3 of double-substituted xylose residues on arabinoxylan, to digest the wheat arabinoxylan. SWUAbf62A is an important debranching enzyme for hydrolysis of hemicelluloses to monosaccharides and can be applied in various industrial biotechnologies."

Highest yield of pectinase (19.15 ± 2.66 U g -1 ), cellulase (46.69 ± 1.19 U g -1 ) and amylase (2097.18 ± 15.28 U g -1 ) was achieved on untreated soybean meal. Highest yield of xylanase (22.35 ± 2.24 U g -1 ) was obtained on untreated wheat bran. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of the B. velezensis 157, composed of a circular 4,013,317 bp chromosome with 3789 coding genes and a G + C content of 46.41%, one circular 8439 bp plasmid and a G + C content of 40.32%. The genome contained a total of 8 candidate gene clusters (bacillaene, difficidin, macrolactin, butirosin, bacillibactin, bacilysin, fengycin and surfactin), and dedicates over 15.8% of the whole genome to synthesize secondary metabolite biosynthesis. In addition, the genes encoding enzymes involved in degradation of cellulose, xylan, lignin, starch, mannan, galactoside and arabinan were found in the B. velezensis 157 genome. Thus, the study of B. velezensis 157 broadened that B. velezensis can not only be used as biocontrol agents, but also has potentially a wide range of applications in lignocellulosic biomass conversion."
"28769954","articletitle","TaARPC3, Contributes to Wheat Resistance against the Stripe Rust Fungus."
"28769954","abstracttext","The actin cytoskeleton participates in numerous cellular processes, including less-characterized processes, such as nuclear organization, chromatin remodeling, transcription, and signal transduction. As a key regulator of actin cytoskeletal dynamics, the actin related protein 2/3 complex (Arp2/3 complex) controls multiple developmental processes in a variety of tissues and cell types. To date, the role of the Arp2/3 complex in plant disease resistance signaling is largely unknown. Herein, we identified and characterized wheat ARPC3, TaARPC3 , which encodes the C3 subunit of the Arp2/3 complex. Expression of TaARPC3 in the arc18 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Δ arc18 resulted in complementation of stress-induced phenotypes in S. cerevisiae , as well as restore wild-type cell shape malformations. TaARPC3 was found predominantly to be localized in the nucleus and cytoplasm when expressed transiently in wheat protoplast. TaARPC3 was significantly induced in response to avirulent race of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ). Knock-down of TaARPC3 by virus-induced gene silencing resulted in a reduction of resistance against Pst through a specific reduction in actin cytoskeletal organization. Interestingly, this reduction was found to coincide with a block in reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, the hypersensitive response (HR), an increase in TaCAT1 mRNA accumulation, and the growth of Pst . Taken together, these findings suggest that TaARPC3 is a key subunit of the Arp2/3 complex which is required for wheat resistance against Pst , a process that is associated with the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton."

"29449853","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) has been a serious production constraint for over two decades, especially in the summer rainfall wheat production regions of South Africa. It is a complex genetic trait controlled by multiple genes, which are significantly influenced by environmental conditions. This complicates the accurate prediction of a cultivar's stability in terms of PHS tolerance. A number of reports have documented the presence of major QTL on chromosomes 3A and 4A of modern bread wheat cultivars, which confer PHS tolerance. In this study, the SSR marker haplotype combination of chromosomes 3A and 4A of former and current South African cultivars were compared with the aim to select for improved PHS tolerance levels in future cultivars. A total of 101 wheat cultivars, including a susceptible cultivar and five international tolerant sources, were used in this study. These cultivars and donors were evaluated for their PHS tolerance by making use of a rain simulator. In addition, five seeds of each entry were planted out into seedling trays and leaf material harvested for DNA isolation. A modified CTAB extraction method was used before progressing to downstream PCR applications. Eight SSR markers targeted from the well-characterized 3A and 4A QTL regions associated with PHS tolerance, were used to conduct targeted haplotype analysis. Additionally, recently published KASP SNP markers, which identify the casual SNP mutations within the TaPHS1 gene, were used to genotype the germplasm. The haplotype marker data and phenotypic PHS data were compared across all cultivars and different production regions. A relative change in observed phenotypic variation percentage was obtained per marker allele and across marker haplotype combinations when compared to the PHS susceptible cultivar, Tugela-DN. Clear favorable haplotypes, contributing 40-60% of the variation for PHS tolerance, were identified for QTL 3A and 4A. Initial analyses show haplotype data appear to be predictive of PHS tolerance status and germplasm can now be selected to improve PHS tolerance. These haplotype data are the first of its kind for PHS genotyping in South Africa. In future, this can be used as a tool to predict the possible PHS tolerance range of a new cultivar."

"29843474","abstracttext","The photosynthetic capacity and efficiency of a crop depends on the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments and chloroplast development. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms of chloroplast development and chlorophyll (Chl) biosynthesis in common wheat because of its huge and complex genome. Ygm , a spontaneous yellow-green leaf color mutant of winter wheat, exhibits reduced Chl contents and abnormal chloroplast development. Thus, we searched for candidate genes associated with this phenotype. Comparative transcriptome profiling was performed using leaves from the yellow leaf color type (Y) and normal green color type (G) of the Ygm mutant progeny. We identified 1227 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Y compared with G (i.e., 689 upregulated genes and 538 downregulated genes). Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses indicated that the DEGs were involved in Chl biosynthesis (i.e., magnesium chelatase subunit H (CHLH) and protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR) genes), carotenoid biosynthesis (i.e., β-carotene hydroxylase (BCH) genes), photosynthesis, and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. We also identified heat shock protein (HSP) genes ( sHSP , HSP70 , HSP90 , and DnaJ ) and heat shock transcription factor genes that might have vital roles in chloroplast development. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the relevant DEGs confirmed the RNA-Seq results. Moreover, measurements of seven intermediate products involved in Chl biosynthesis and five carotenoid compounds involved in carotenoid-xanthophyll biosynthesis confirmed that CHLH and BCH are vital enzymes for the unusual leaf color phenotype in Y type. These results provide insights into leaf color variation in wheat at the transcriptional level."

"29083384","abstracttext","The water-insoluble storage proteins of cereals (prolamins) are called ""gluten"" in wheat, barley, and rye, and ""avenins"" in oat. Gluten can provoke celiac disease (CD) in genetically susceptible individuals (those with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2 or HLA-DQ8 serotypes). Avenins are present at a lower concentration (10%-15% of total protein content) in oat as compared to gluten in wheat (80%-85%). The avenins in the genus Avena (cultivated oat as well as various wild species of which gene bank accessions were analyzed) are free of the known CD immunogenic epitopes from wheat, barley, and rye. T cells that recognize avenin-specific epitopes have been found very rarely in CD patients. CD patients that consume oats daily do not show significantly increased levels of intraepithelial lymphocyte (EIL) cells. The safety and the positive health effects of the long-term inclusion of oats in the gluten-free diet have been confirmed in long-term studies. Since 2009 (EC 41/2009) and 2013 (FDA) oat products may be sold as gluten-free in several countries provided a gluten contamination level below 20 ppm. Introduction of oats in the gluten-free diet of celiac patients is advised after the recovery of the intestine. Health effects of oat consumption are reflected in European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)- and Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved health claims. Oats can form a healthy, nutritious, fiber-rich, and safe complement to the gluten-free diet."

"29795612","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust was once the most destructive plant disease, but it has been largely controlled. However, to prevent future problems, the ongoing development of resistant wheat varieties requires knowledge of the changing virulence patterns for Pgt virulence of the fungus that causes wheat stem rust and the detection of new races. Surveys were conducted from 2013-2014 to determine the races of the Pgt present in China. Low levels of stem rust infections were found in China during this investigation and 11 Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) samples were obtained. In addition, 22 Pgt samples collected from the alternate host (Berberis) were obtained and have been reported for the first time. Fifty-three isolates were obtained from all samples. Four race groups, including 13 physiological races, were identified. They included the most prevalent races, 34C3MTGQM and 34C6MRGQM, with 13.2% predominance, followed by 34C0MRGQM at 11.3%. Six new races that were virulent against the resistance genes, Sr5 + Sr11, were found for the first time in China, namely 34C0MRGQM, 34C3MTGQM, 34C3MKGQM, 34C3MKGSM, 34C6MTGSM, and 34C6MRGQM, with a predominance of 11.3, 13.2, 9.4, 9.4, 1.9, and 13.2%, respectively. Most of the genes studied were ineffective against one or more of the tested isolates, except Sr9e, Sr21, Sr26, Sr31, Sr33, Sr38, Sr47, and SrTt3. Genes Sr35, SrTmp, Sr30, Sr37, Sr17, and Sr36 were effective in 92.5, 86.8, 84.9, 84.9, 79.3, and 77.4% of the tested isolates, respectively. In contrast, all of the isolates were virulent against Sr6, Sr7b, Sr9a, Sr9b, Sr9d, Sr9g, and SrMcN. Our results indicate that remarkable differences exist among the categories of the races in this study (i.e., their known virulence gene spectra) and the Pgt races reported previously. In addition, the sexual cycle of Pgt may contribute to its diversity in China."

"29780395","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive wheat disease present throughout the world, and host resistance is an effective and economical strategy used to control FHB. Lack of adequate resistance resource is still a main bottleneck for FHB genetics and wheat breeding research. The synthetic-derived bread wheat line C615, which does not carry the Fhb1 gene, is a promising source of FHB resistance for breeding. A population of 198 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) produced by crossing C615 with the susceptible cultivar Yangmai 13 was evaluated for FHB response using point and spray inoculations. As the disease phenotype is frequently complicated by other agronomic traits, we used both traditional and multivariate conditional QTL mapping approaches to investigate the genetic relationships (at the individual QTL level) between FHB resistance and plant height (PH), spike compactness (SC), and days to flowering (FD). A linkage map was constructed from 3,901 polymorphic SNP markers, which covered 2,549.2 cM. Traditional and conditional QTL mapping analyses found 13 and 22 QTL for FHB, respectively; 10 were identified by both methods. Among these 10, three QTL from C615 were detected in multiple years; these QTL were located on chromosomes 2AL, 2DS, and 2DL. Conditional QTL mapping analysis indicated that, at the QTL level, SC strongly influenced FHB in point inoculation; whereas PH and SC contributed more to FHB than did FD in spray inoculation. The three stable QTL ( QFhbs-jaas.2AL, QFhbp-jaas.2DS , and QFhbp-jaas.2DL ) for FHB were partly affected by or were independent of the three agronomic traits. The QTL detected in this study improve our understanding of the genetic relationships between FHB response and related traits at the QTL level and provide useful information for marker-assisted selection for the improvement of FHB resistance in breeding."

"29855673","abstracttext","The domesticated gene Q on wheat chromosome 5A (5AQ) encodes an AP2 transcription factor. The 5AQ was originated from a G to A mutation in exon 8 and/or C to T transition in exon 10 and resulted in free-threshing and subcompact spike characters of bread wheat. The Q homeoalleles on 5B and 5D are either a pseudogene or expressed at a low level. Our previous study identified a mutant, named NAUH164, by EMS treatment of wheat variety Sumai 3. The mutant exhibits compact spike and dwarfness, and the mutated locus Rht23 was mapped to the distal of the long arm of chromosome 5D, where 5Dq was located. To investigate the relationship of Rht23 and 5Dq, sequences and expression patterns of 5Dq from Sumai 3 and NAUH164 were compared. The two genotypes had a G3147A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), which was predicted to be located within the miR172 binding site of 5Dq. Based on this SNP, an SNP marker was developed and linkage analysis using a (NAUH164 × Alondra's) RIL population showed the marker was co-segregated with the Rht23 mutant traits. The qRT-PCR and Northern blot showed that in NAUH164, the expression of 5Dq was significantly up-regulated, and consistently, the expression of Ta-miR172 was down-regulated in leaves, stems and spikes. Our results demonstrated that point mutation in the miR172 binding site of the 5Dq likely increased its transcript level via a reduction in miRNA-dependent degradation, and this resulted in pleiotropic effects on spike compactness and plant dwarfness."
"29952048","articletitle","The genetic architecture of genome-wide recombination rate variation in allopolyploid wheat revealed by nested association mapping."
"29952048","abstracttext","Recombination affects the fate of alleles in populations by imposing constraints on the reshuffling of genetic information. Understanding the genetic basis of these constraints is critical for manipulating the recombination process to improve the resolution of genetic mapping, and reducing the negative effects of linkage drag and deleterious genetic load in breeding. Using sequence-based genotyping of a wheat nested association mapping (NAM) population of 2,100 recombinant inbred lines created by crossing 29 diverse lines, we mapped QTL affecting the distribution and frequency of 102 000 crossovers (CO). Genome-wide recombination rate variation was mostly defined by rare alleles with small effects together explaining up to 48.6% of variation. Most QTL were additive and showed predominantly trans-acting effects. The QTL affecting the proximal COs also acted additively without increasing the frequency of distal COs. We showed that the regions with decreased recombination carry more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with possible deleterious effects than the regions with a high recombination rate. Therefore, our study offers insights into the genetic basis of recombination rate variation in wheat and its effect on the distribution of deleterious SNPs across the genome. The identified trans-acting additive QTL can be utilized to manipulate CO frequency and distribution in the large polyploid wheat genome opening the possibility to improve the efficiency of gene pyramiding and reducing the deleterious genetic load in the low-recombining pericentromeric regions of chromosomes."

Previously, flow cytometry combined with PCR analysis demonstrated that the HOSUT transgene had been integrated into different wheat chromosomes: 7A, 5D, and 4A in HOSUT12, HOSUT20, and HOSUT24, respectively. In order to confirm the chromosomal location of the HOSUT transgene by a cytological approach using wheat aneuploid stocks, we crossed corresponding nullisomic-tetrasomic lines with the three HOSUT lines, namely nullisomic 7A-tetrasomic 7B with HOSUT12, nullisomic 5D-tetrasomic 5B with HOSUT20, and nullisomic 4A-tetrasomic 4B with HOSUT24. We examined the resulting chromosomal constitutions and the presence of the HOSUT transgene in the F 2 progeny by means of chromosome banding and PCR. The chromosome banding patterns of the critical chromosomes in the original HOSUT lines showed no difference from those of the corresponding wild type chromosomes. The presence or absence of the critical chromosomes completely corresponded to the presence or absence of the HOSUT transgene in the F 2 plants. Investigating telocentric chromosomes occurred in the F 2 progeny, which were derived from the respective critical HOSUT chromosomes, we found that the HOSUT transgene was individually integrated on the long arms of chromosomes 4A, 7A, and 5D in the three HOSUT lines. Thus, in this study we verified the chromosomal locations of the transgene, which had previously been determined by flow cytometry, and moreover revealed the chromosome-arm locations of the HOSUT transgene in the HOSUT lines."

"31156587","abstracttext","Ustilago segetum (Pers.) Roussel tritici (UST) causes loose smut of wheat account for considerable grain yield losses globally. For effective management, knowledge of its genetic variability and population structure is a prerequisite. In this study, UST isolates sampled from four different wheat growing zones of India were analyzed using the second largest subunit of the RNA polymerase II ( RPB2 ) and a set of sixteen neutral simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers. Among the 112 UST isolates genotyped, 98 haplotypes were identified. All the isolates were categorized into two groups ( K = 2), each consisting of isolates from different sampling sites, on the basis of unweighted paired-grouping method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) and the Bayesian analysis of population structure. The positive and significant index of association (I A = 1.169) and standardized index of association (rBar D = 0.075) indicate population is of non-random mating type. Analysis of molecular variance showed that the highest variance component is among isolates (91%), with significantly low genetic differentiation variation among regions (8%) (F st = 0.012). Recombination (R m = 0) was not detected. The results showed that UST isolates have a clonal genetic structure with limited genetic differentiation and human arbitrated gene flow and mutations are the prime evolutionary processes determining its genetic structure. These findings will be helpful in devising management strategy especially for selection and breeding of resistant wheat cultivars."

"30769526","abstracttext","Little is known about the population structure of wheat powdery mildew in the eastern United States, and the most recent report on virulence in this population involved isolates collected in 1993-94. In the present study, wheat leaves naturally infected with powdery mildew were collected from 10 locations in the southeastern United States in 2003 and 2005 and a collection of 207 isolates was derived from single ascospores. Frequencies of virulence to 16 mildew resistance (Pm) genes were determined by inoculating the isolates individually on replicated plates of detached leaves of differential wheat lines. These virulence frequencies were used to infer local effectiveness of Pm genes, estimate virulence complexity, detect significant associations between pairs of pathogen avirulence loci, and assess whether phenotypic differences between pathogen subpopulations increased with geographic distance. In both years, virulence to Pm3a, Pm3c, Pm5a, and Pm7 was present in more than 90% of sampled isolates and virulence to Pm1a, Pm16, Pm17, and Pm25 was present in fewer than 10% of isolates. In each year, 71 to 88% of all sampled isolates possessed one of a few multilocus virulence phenotypes, although there were significant differences among locations in frequencies of virulence to individual Pm genes. Several significant associations were detected between alleles for avirulence to pairs of Pm genes. Genetic (phenotypic) distance between isolate subpopulations increased significantly (R 2 = 0.40, P < 0.001) with increasing geographic separation; possible explanations include different commercial deployment of Pm genes and restricted gene flow in the pathogen population."

"32210989","abstracttext","Research, production, and use of genetically modified (GM) crops have split the world between supporters and opponents. Up to now, this technology has been limited to the control of weeds and pests, whereas the second generation of GM crops is expected to assist farmers in abiotic stress tolerance or improved nutritional features. Aiming to analyze this subject holistically, in this presentation we address an advanced technology for drought-tolerant GM crops, upscaling from molecular details obtained in the laboratory to an extensive network of field trials as well as the impact of the introduction of this innovation into the market. Sunflower has divergent transcription factors, which could be key actors in the drought response orchestrating several signal transduction pathways, generating an improved performance to deal with water deficit. One of such factors, HaHB4, belongs to the homeodomain-leucine zipper family and was first introduced in Arabidopsis. Transformed plants had improved tolerance to water deficits, through the inhibition of ethylene sensitivity and not by stomata closure. Wheat and soybean plants expressing the HaHB4 gene were obtained and cropped across a wide range of growing conditions exhibiting enhanced adaptation to drought-prone environments, the most important constraint affecting crop yield worldwide. The performance of wheat and soybean, however, differed slightly across mentioned environments; whereas the improved behavior of GM wheat respect to controls was less dependent on the temperature regime (cool or warm), differences between GM and wild-type soybeans were remarkably larger in warmer compared to cooler conditions. In both species, these GM crops are good candidates to become market products in the near future. In anticipation of consumers' and other stakeholders' interest, spectral analyses of field crops have been conducted to differentiate these GM crops from wild type and commercial cultivars. In this paper, the potential impact of the release of such market products is discussed, considering the perspectives of different stakeholders."

"32237246","abstracttext","Reducing the number of tillers per plant using a tiller inhibition (tin) gene has been considered as an important trait for wheat production in dryland environments. We used a spatial analysis approach with a daily time-step coupled radiation and transpiration efficiency model to simulate the impact of the reduced-tillering trait on wheat yield under different climate change scenarios across Australia's arable land. Our results show a small but consistent yield advantage of the reduced-tillering trait in the most water-limited environments both under current and likely future conditions. Our climate scenarios show that whilst elevated [CO 2 ] (e[CO 2 ]) alone might limit the area where the reduced-tillering trait is advantageous, the most likely climate scenario of e[CO 2 ] combined with increased temperature and reduced rainfall consistently increased the area where restricted tillering has an advantage. Whilst long-term average yield advantages were small (ranged from 31 to 51 kg ha -1  year -1 ), across large dryland areas the value is large (potential cost-benefits ranged from Australian dollar 23 to 60 MIL/year). It seems therefore worthwhile to further explore this reduced-tillering trait in relation to a range of different environments and climates, because its benefits are likely to grow in future dry environments where wheat is grown around the world."

"32172102","abstracttext","Biochar application is considered an effective method of reducing nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emissions in soil. However, the mechanism and temporal effect of different doses of biochar on N 2 O emissions is still obscure. Here, we conducted a two-year field experiment to test the effects of different input amounts and frequencies of biochar on soil N 2 O emissions in North China. Biochar was applied in six different treatments in a winter wheat and summer maize rotation system: applications of 0 t/ha biochar (C0), 2.25 t/ha biochar (C1), 4.5 t/ha biochar (C2), 9 t/ha biochar (C3), and 13.5 t/ha biochar (C4) each year, and a single application of 13.5 t/ha biochar (CS) in the first year. The results showed that biochar could inhibit N 2 O emissions, reaching 20.6% to 60.1% in the wheat season and 18.1% to 39.4% in the maize season. The inhibitory effect of biochar on soil N 2 O emissions was dependent on amount and time. C3 had the best results in the wheat season, although its inhibitory effect in the maize season was not as good relative to C4 due to the lower biochar application. In addition, CS significantly reduced (27.7%) the cumulative N 2 O emissions in the first year, although the inhibitory effect disappeared in the second year. Biochar increased the nosZ gene copy numbers and promoted a reduction of N 2 O in the soil via the denitrification process. In conclusion, the inhibition of N 2 O emissions during denitrification is an important factor for reducing soil N 2 O emissions by biochar, and the inhibition of biochar is influenced by the input amount and time."

"32061991","abstracttext","Chromium (Cr) concentration has been increasing substantially in the environment due to industrial and anthropogenic factors. Plants can absorb Cr and undergo unrestrained oxidation cascades, resulting in cell injury. The ameliorative role of biogenic copper nanoparticles to relieve wheat plants from Cr stress by supporting their growth is still unclear. The present work aims at the biosynthesis and characterization of copper nanoparticles (CuNPs) from a native Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, followed by assessment of wheat growth and physiological responses to CuNPs mixed in Cr-rich soil. The taxonomic rank of K. pneumoniae SN35 was established by the 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The properties of biogenic CuNPs were elucidated by using UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR, XRD, SEM, and TEM. It was found that 19.01-47.47 nm spherical shaped CuNPs were stabilized by different functional groups produced extracellularly by the strain SN35. The XRD data revealed the crystalline nature of CuNPs as a face-centered cubic structure. Different concentrations of CuNPs (0, 25, 50 and 100 mg kg -1 of soil) were added into the soil mixed with 3.5 mg kg -1 K 2 Cr 2 O 7 and the pots were placed in a growth chamber for 30 days. The results revealed that the CuNPs, at 25 and 50 mg kg -1 of soil, augmented plant growth, biomass, and cellular antioxidants contents, whereas decreased the reactive oxygen species and Cr translocation from soil to roots and shoots as compared to control plants. Overall, the results revealed that the soil amendment of CuNPs could immobilize the Cr in the soil to prevent its translocation to the upper plant parts and support wheat growth by relieving cellular oxidative stress."
"32511047","articletitle","Development of an Evaluation System for Fusarium Resistance in Wheat Grains and Its Application in Assessment of the Corresponding Effects of Fhb1 ."
"32511047","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium species is a globally important wheat disease. Host resistance to FHB is composed of multiple mechanisms, including resistance to initial infection (type I), disease spread (type II), toxin accumulation (type III), kernel infection (type IV), and yield loss (type V), of which the last three have been less studied. Traditionally, the Fusarium -damaged kernel rate (FDK; percentage of Fusarium -infected grains) from point- or spray-inoculated experiments was used as the parameter for type IV resistance, which may be problematic because of the influence of type II resistance. Here we propose a new definition for type IV resistance: that is, the resistance against Fusarium infection expressed in wheat grains that have the same chance in contact with the pathogen, under favorable temperature and humidity for infection. Fhb1 confers strong type II resistance, leading to significantly reduced FHB severity and FDK. To investigate the role of Fhb1 in type IV resistance, a pair of near-isogenic lines, R22W ( Fhb1 carrier, resistant in terms of type II resistance) and S22V (non- Fhb1 , susceptible), along with eight wheat genotypes differing at Fhb1 were inoculated at different grain development stages with Fusarium macrospores both in vivo and in vitro. The in vivo experiments with all florets inoculated demonstrated a significant reduction in thousand kernel weight (TKW) in inoculated grains, regardless of their Fhb1 status and developmental stages. Surprisingly, R22W showed more TKW reduction than S22V, which was supported by the scanning electron microscopy observation that confirmed the more severe degradation of starch granules in R22W grains. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that grains from both R22W and S22V promoted fungal colonization, but no significant difference was found between the two lines. In summary, our results indicated that the proposed type IV evaluation system is effective in determining different grain resistance levels, providing novel tools for FHB resistance breeding. The finding that Fhb1 is not associated with type IV resistance enriches our understanding of this gene."

"32464490","abstracttext","Soil phosphorus (P) occurs in pools of lower availability due to soil P fixation and therefore, it is a key constrain to crop production. Long term molybdenum-induced effects in wheat and rhizosphere/non-rhizosphere soil P dynamics have not yet been investigated. Here, a long term field experiment was conducted to explore these effects in wheat consisting of two treatments i.e. with molybdenum (+Mo) and without molybdenum (-Mo). The results revealed that molybdenum (Mo) supply increased plant biomass, grain yield, P uptake, preserved the configuration of chloroplast, stomata, and mesophyll tissue cells, suggesting the complementary effects of Mo on wheat yield and P accumulation. During the periods of vegetative growth, soil organic carbon, organic matter, and microbial biomass P were higher and tended to decrease in rhizosphere soil at maturity stage. In +Mo treatment, the most available P fractions [H 2 O-Pi (16.2-22.9 mg/kg and 4.24-7.57 mg/kg) and NaHCO 3 -Pi (130-149 mg/kg and 77.2-88 mg/kg)] were significantly increased in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils, respectively. In addition, the +Mo treatment significantly increased the acid phosphatase activity and the expression of phoN/phoC, aphA, olpA/lppC gene transcripts in rhizosphere soil compared to -Mo. Our research findings suggested that Mo application has increased P availability not only through biochemical and chemical changes in rhizosphere but also through P assimilation and induced effects in the leaf ultra-structures. So, it might be a strategy of long term Mo fertilizer supply to overcome the P scarcity in plants and rhizosphere soil."
"32373095","articletitle","LysM Proteins Regulate Fungal Development and Contribute to Hyphal Protection and Biocontrol Traits in Clonostachys rosea ."
"32373095","abstracttext","Lysin motif (LysM) modules are approximately 50 amino acids long and bind to peptidoglycan, chitin and its derivatives. Certain LysM proteins in plant pathogenic and entomopathogenic fungi are shown to scavenge chitin oligosaccharides and thereby dampen host defense reactions. Other LysM proteins can protect the fungal cell wall against hydrolytic enzymes. In this study, we investigated the biological function of LysM proteins in the mycoparasitic fungus Clonostachys rosea . The C . rosea genome contained three genes coding for LysM-containing proteins and gene expression analysis revealed that lysm1 and lysm2 were induced during mycoparasitic interaction with Fusarium graminearum and during colonization of wheat roots. Lysm1 was suppressed in germinating conidia, while lysm2 was induced during growth in chitin or peptidoglycan-containing medium. Deletion of lysm1 and lysm2 resulted in mutants with increased levels of conidiation and conidial germination, but reduced ability to control plant diseases caused by F . graminearum and Botrytis cinerea . The Δ lysm2 strain showed a distinct, accelerated mycelial disintegration phenotype accompanied by reduced biomass production and hyphal protection against hydrolytic enzymes including chitinases, suggesting a role of LYSM2 in hyphal protection against chitinases. The Δ lysm2 and Δ lysm1 Δ lysm2 strains displayed reduced ability to colonize wheat roots, while only Δ lysm1 Δ lysm2 failed to suppress expression of the wheat defense response genes PR1 and PR4 . Based on our data, we propose a role of LYSM1 as a regulator of fungal development and of LYSM2 in cell wall protection against endogenous hydrolytic enzymes, while both are required to suppress plant defense responses. Our findings expand the understanding of the role of LysM proteins in fungal-fungal interactions and biocontrol."

"32544001","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina , is a common fungal disease of wheat in China. In order to identify races and determine the individual virulence of isolates in different wheat-growing regions in China, leaf rust samples collected from 18 provinces in 2011 to 2013 were tested on 37 Thatcher near-isogenic lines each carrying a different single leaf rust resistance gene. A total of 158 races were identified. Races THTT (19.5%), THTS (16.9%), PHTT (7.7%), THJS (5.0%), THJT (4.2%), and PHTS (4.0%) were the most predominant races in 2011 to 2013. All of these races were avirulent to resistance genes Lr9 and Lr24 . The two most frequent races, THTT and THTS, were widely distributed. The frequencies of the isolates with virulence to Lr1 , Lr2c , Lr3 , Lr16 , Lr26 , Lr17 , LrB , Lr10 , Lr14a , Lr3bg , Lr14b , Lr33 , Lr37 , and Lr50 exceeded 90%. Frequencies of virulence to Lr2a , Lr3ka , Lr11 , Lr30 , Lr2b , and Lr32 exceeded 70% but were less than 90%. Frequencies of virulence to Lr18 , Lr21 , Lr15 , Lr23 , Lr33+34 , Lr36 , Lr39 , and Lr44 were below 70%, whereas the frequency of virulence to Lr25 was less than 1%. All isolates were avirulent to Lr9 , Lr19 , Lr24 , Lr28 , Lr42 , Lr29 , Lr38 , and Lr47 . The identified races and individual virulence frequencies provide a basis for selection of effective leaf rust resistance genes for use in breeding programs and can also provide information for the study of race evolution of P. triticina ."

"30238531","abstracttext","The reference genome sequence of wheat 'Chinese Spring' (CS) is now available (IWGSC RefSeq v1.0), but the core sequences defining the nucleolar organizer regions (NORs) have not been characterized. We estimated that the total copy number of the rDNA units in the wheat genome is 11 160, of which 30.5%, 60.9% and 8.6% are located on Nor-B1 (1B), Nor-B2 (6B) and other NORs, respectively. The total length of the NORs is estimated to be 100 Mb, corresponding to approximately 10% of the unassembled portion of the genome not represented in RefSeq v1.0. Four subtypes (S1-S4) of the rDNA units were identified based on differences within the 3' external transcribed spacer regions in Nor-B1 and Nor-B2, and quantitative PCR indicated locus-specific variation in rDNA subtype contents. Expression analyses of rDNA subtypes revealed that S1 was predominantly expressed and S2 weakly expressed, in contrast to the relative abundance of rDNA subtypes in the wheat genome. These results suggest a regulation mechanism of differential rDNA expression based on sequence differences. S3 expression increased in the ditelosomic lines Dt1BL and Dt6BL, suggesting that S3 is subjected to chromosome-mediated silencing. Structural differences were detected in the regions surrounding the NOR among homoeologous chromosomes of groups 1 and 6. The adjacent regions distal to the major NORs were expanded compared with their homoeologous counterparts, and the gene density of these expanded regions was relatively low. We provide evidence that these regions are likely to be important for autoregulation of the associated major NORs as well as silencing of minor NORs."

"30216614","abstracttext_methods and results","We selected a wheat field characterized by a diversified topography, to be responsible for variations in productivity and in canopy-driven microclimate. Fusarium and Alternaria mycotoxins where quantified in wheat ears at three sampling dates between flowering and harvest at 40 points. Tenuazonic acid (TeA), alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), tentoxin (TEN), deoxynivalenol (DON), zearalenone (ZEN) and deoxynivalenol-3-Glucoside (DON.3G) were quantified. In canopy temperature, air and soil humidity were recorded for each point with data-loggers. Fusarium spp. as trichothecene producers, Alternaria spp. and fungal abundances were assessed using qPCR. Pseudomonas fluorescens bacteria were quantified with a culture based method. We only found DON, DON.3G, TeA and TEN to be ubiquitous across the whole field, while AME, AOH and ZEN were only occasionally detected. Fusarium was more abundant in spots with high soil humidity, while Alternaria in warmer and drier spots. Mycotoxins correlated differently to the observed explanatory variables: positive correlations between DON accumulation, tri 5 gene and Fusarium abundance were clearly detected. The correlations among the others observed variables, such as microclimatic conditions, varied among the sampling dates. The results of statistical model identification do not exclude that species coexistence could influence mycotoxin production."

"30780647","abstracttext","Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, historically was one of the most destructive diseases of wheat and barley. The disease has been under effective control worldwide through the widespread use of host resistance. A number of stem rust resistance genes in wheat have been characterized for their reactions to specific races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. Adult plant responses to race TTKS (also known as Ug99) of monogenic lines for Sr genes, a direct measurement of the effectiveness for a given gene, have not been investigated to any extent. This report summarizes adult plant infection responses and seedling infection types for monogenic lines of designated Sr genes challenged with race TTKS. High infection types at the seedling stage and susceptible infection responses in adult plants were observed on monogenic lines carrying Sr5, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9a, 9b, 9d, 9g, 10, 11, 12, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 30, 31, 34, 38, and Wld-1. Monogenic lines of resistance genes Sr13, 22, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 40, 44, Tmp, and Tt-3 were effective against TTKS both at the seedling and adult plant stages. The low infection types to race TTKS observed for these resistance genes corresponded to the expected low infections of these genes to other incompatible races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. The level of resistance conferred by these genes at the adult plant stage varied between highly resistant to moderately susceptible. The results from this study were inconclusive for determining the effectiveness of resistance genes Sr9e, 14, 21, and 29 against race TTKS. The understanding of the effectiveness of individual Sr genes against race TTKS will facilitate the utilization of these genes in breeding for stem rust resistance in wheat."

"30812359","abstracttext","Frequent epidemics of leaf rust in Egypt have been attributed to the appearance of new races virulent on commonly grown wheat cultivars. In 1998, 1999, and 2000, 726 isolates of Puccinia triticina collected in Egypt were tested on a set of 20 single Lr gene differential wheat lines, and 160 races were identified. Three races, MBDLQ, MCDLQ, and TCDMQ, were found in Egypt in all 3 years. Race MCDLQ occurred at >20% frequency each year. Virulences to wheat lines with Lr1, 3, 10, 14b, 15, 17, 23, and 26 occurred at >45% each year. Seven races found in Egypt also were found in either Israel, Sudan, Turkey, or Romania in 1998 or 1999, although the one race common to Sudan and Egypt was rare in Egypt (only 1 year, <1%). Four races found in Israel also were found in Egypt, and the similarity of virulence frequencies in Israel and Egypt indicate at least some exchange of inoculum. Romania and Turkey did not appear to be major sources of inoculum for leaf rust epidemics in Egypt. The level of genetic diversity in leaf rust collections in Egypt in 1998 to 2000 was similar to that of collections from the Southern and Central Plains of the United States in 1998 to 2000. The high diversity of races and the recurrence of common races in each year in Egypt as in the Southern and Central Plains of the United States is consistent with oversummer survival of P. triticina within Egypt or in a neighboring country. The buildup of races virulent on cultivars with the most commonly used Lr genes for resistance in Egypt also is consistent with year-round survival within Egypt or cyclical exchange of inoculum between Egypt and a neighboring country."

"30836662","abstracttext","Plastidial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, GAPCp) are ubiquitous proteins that play pivotal roles in plant metabolism and are involved in stress response. However, the mechanism of GAPCp's function in plant stress resistance process remains unclear. Here we isolated, identified, and characterized the TaGAPCp1 gene from Chinese Spring wheat for further investigation. Subcellular localization assay indicated that the TaGAPCp1 protein was localized in the plastid of tobacco ( Nicotiana tobacum ) protoplast. In addition, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) unraveled that the expression of TaGAPCp1 (GenBank: MF477938.1) was evidently induced by osmotic stress and abscisic acid (ABA). This experiment also screened its interaction protein, cytochrome b6-f complex iron sulfite subunit (Cyt b6f), from the wheat cDNA library using TaGAPCp1 protein as a bait via the yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H) and the interaction between Cyt b6f and TaGAPCp1 was verified by bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC). Moreover, H₂O₂ could also be used as a signal molecule to participate in the process of Cyt b6f response to abiotic stress. Subsequently, we found that the chlorophyll content in OE- TaGAPCp1 plants was significantly higher than that in wild type (WT) plants. In conclusion, our data revealed that TaGAPCp1 plays an important role in abiotic stress response in wheat and this stress resistance process may be completed by H₂O₂-mediated ABA signaling pathway."

"30276698","abstracttext","The major challenges for the plants growing in metal-contaminated soils are deficiency of nutrients, biomass reduction, and severe oxidative damages in the presence of heavy metals. In this regard, our aim was to overcome these challenges through the use of efficient microbial strains in metal-polluted soils and to assess its/their physiological and biochemical effects. In the current study, a copper (Cu)-resistant bacterium was isolated from the rhizospheric soil of 'Ziziphus nummularia' and evaluated for its ability to promote the wheat growth under the gradient stress of copper. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolate was identified as Pantoea sp. Among the plant growth promoting tests, the isolate showed the production of indole acetic acid, solubilization of inorganic phosphate, and ACC deaminase activity. Also, the isolate showed resistance to many heavy metals and antibiotics and increased the water-soluble copper in solution. The results of pot studies showed that bacterial application promoted various growth parameters of wheat plants and also enhanced the Cu uptake of wheat from the Cu-amended soil. The results showed that enhancement of Cu stress (100 to 300 mg kg -1 ) resulted in a decrease in various compatible solutes such as proline, total soluble sugars, and total protein content, and increase in the level of malondialdehyde (MDA), latter of which is the indicator of oxidative stress. Bacterial treatment markedly increased the proline, soluble sugar, total protein content, and decreased the MDA content under Cu stress. In addition, bacterial inoculation significantly alleviated the harmful effect of metal toxicity by decreasing the activation of ROS molecules including superoxide (O 2 - ) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ). The activation of various antioxidative enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD), and catalase (CAT) was noted following bacterial inoculation under Cu stress. Therefore, the present study demonstrates the potential of the isolate Pantoea sp. ZNP-5 to improve the growth and phytoextraction of metal from the metal-polluted soil through the polyphasic mechanism of action."

Among the tribe Triticeae, Aegilops tauschii is one of the most valuable gene sources of resistance to abiotic stresses. In order to identify the most tolerant accession to moisture stress, and to understand its adaptive mechanisms at the molecular level, the present experiment was carried out on ten Ae. tauschii accessions under normal (95% soil pot capacity) and moisture stress (45% soil pot capacity) conditions. At the start of the heading time, the expanded flag leaves of treated and untreated plants were sampled for two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) based on proteomics approach. A19 accession was less affected by the imposed moisture stress; therefore, it was used for the proteomics experiment. Among 252 protein spots which were reproducibly detected in each given 2-DE gels, 25 spots showed significant differences between the two moisture treatments; 17 spots were upregulated and 8 spots were downregulated. The identified proteins by MALDI-TOF/TOF, were allocated to seven functional protein groups, which were mainly involved in photosynthesis/respiration (28.5%), carbohydrate metabolism (14.2%), energy metabolism (7.1%), chaperone (14.2%), protein translation and processing (14.2%), repair and stability of the genome (7.1%) and unknown function (14.2%). We report this for the first time that RMI2 protein (in the group of repair and stability of the genome) was significantly changed in wheat in response to moisture stress. We believe that, the identified proteins could play important roles in acclimation and tolerance to moisture stress and provide the genetic pathways for improving tolerance to moisture stress in wheat."

By contrast, eCO2 decreased or did not change these parameters for lines carrying only TaALMT1, and enhanced biomass allocation to grains thereby resulting in increased grain yield. Despite TaMATE1B being less effective than TaALMT1 at conferring Al3+ resistance based on root growth, the gene promoted grain yield to a similar level to TaALMT1 when the plants were grown in acid soil.

"30250459","abstracttext","Natural control of phytopathogenic microorganisms is assumed as a priority function of the commensal plant microbiota. In this study, the suitability of fluorescent pseudomonads in the phyllosphere of crop plants as natural control agents was evaluated. Under field conditions, ears of winter wheat were found to be colonized with high consistency and at a high density by pseudomonads at the late milk dough stage. Isolates of these bacteria were evaluated for their potential to protect the plants from phytopathogenic Alternaria and Fusarium fungi. More Pseudomonas isolates were antagonistically active against alternaria than against fusaria in the dual culture test. The alternaria responded species-specifically and more sensitively to bacterial antagonism than the strain-specific reacting fusaria. A total of 110 randomly selected Pseudomonas isolates were screened for genes involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotics 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, phenazine-1-carboxylic acid, pyoluteorin, and pyrrolnitrin. The key gene for production of the phloroglucinol was found in none of these isolates. At least one of the genes, encoding the biosynthesis of the other antibiotics was detected in 81% of the isolates tested. However, the antagonistic effect found in the dual culture assay was not necessarily associated with the presence of these antibiotic genes. Wheat grains as natural substrate were inoculated with selected antagonistic Pseudomonas isolates and Alternaria and Fusarium strains, respectively. The fungal growth was only slightly delayed, but the mycotoxin production was significantly reduced in most of these approaches. In conclusion, the distribution of phytopathogenic fungi of the genera Alternaria and Fusarium in the field is unlikely to be inhibited by naturally occurring pseudomonads, also because the bacterial antagonists were not evenly distributed in the field. However, pseudomonads can reduce the production of Alternaria and Fusarium mycotoxins in wheat grains and thus have the potential to improve the crop quality."

The interactive effects of Vrn-B1 and Vrn-D1 on HD and FD were identical to those of Vrn-B1b. Approximately 35.3% of the cultivars carried Ppd-B1a (photoperiod-insensitive) and exhibited the earliest HD and FD. The Ppd-D1a-insensitive allele (Hapl II) was carried by just 0.5% of the varieties; however, the other two sensitive alleles were present at a higher frequency, and their effects were slightly weaker than those of Ppd-B1a.

The Se content of Aegilops tauschii (Ae. tauschii), one of the ancestors of hexaploid common wheat, is generally higher than that of wheat.

"30444293","articletitle","The bZIP transcription factor SPA Heterodimerizing Protein represses glutenin synthesis in Triticum aestivum."
"30444293","abstracttext","The quality of wheat grain is mainly determined by the quantity and composition of its grain storage proteins (GSPs). Grain storage proteins consist of low- and high-molecular-weight glutenins (LMW-GS and HMW-GS, respectively) and gliadins. The synthesis of these proteins is essentially regulated at the transcriptional level and by the availability of nitrogen and sulfur. The regulation network has been extensively studied in barley where BLZ1 and BLZ2, members of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, activate the synthesis of hordeins. To date, in wheat, only the ortholog of BLZ2, Storage Protein Activator (SPA), has been identified as playing a major role in the regulation of GSP synthesis. Here, the ortholog of BLZ1, named SPA Heterodimerizing Protein (SHP), was identified and its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of the genes coding for GSPs was analyzed. In gel mobility shift assays, SHP binds cis-motifs known to bind to bZIP family transcription factors in HMW-GS and LMW-GS promoters. Moreover, we showed by transient expression assays in wheat endosperm that SHP acts as a repressor of the activity of these gene promoters. This result was confirmed in transgenic lines overexpressing SHP, which were grown with low and high nitrogen supply. The phenotype of SHP-overexpressing lines showed a lower quantity of both LMW-GS and HMW-GS, while the quantity of gliadin was unchanged, whatever the nitrogen availability. Thus, the gliadin/glutenin ratio was increased, which suggests that gliadin and glutenin genes may be differently regulated."

"30339225","abstracttext","Many aphids can adapt on plants of differential resistance levels, but molecular interactions underlying host plant utilization and shift of aphids are still not well understood. Here, we sequenced the transcriptome and compared global gene expression profiles of Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) feeding on wheat (i.e., the susceptible plant) and barley (i.e., the resistant plant). In total, 65,200 high-quality unigenes were identified from the merged transcriptomes, and 861 of them were differentially expressed. Relative to their expression on barley, all differentially expressed P450 (cytochrome 450 monooxygenase) genes (e.g., SavCYP6A13, SavCYP4C1, and SavCYP4G15) in S. avenae on wheat were upregulated, suggesting the significance of P450s in xenobiotic metabolism for this aphid on wheat. For S. avenae on barley, some genes encoding for ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters (e.g., ABCG1, ABCG4, ABCB7, and ABCA5) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs; e.g., UGT2B1 and UGT2C1) showed a dramatic increase in expression, suggesting that ABC transporters and UGTs could be critical for detoxification metabolism in S. avenae on barley. In addition, the expression for nearly all differentially expressed proteases was upregulated for S. avenae on barley, reflecting xenobiotic challenges facing S. avenae on resistant barley. Thus, various detoxification and other defense-related genes (e.g., proteases and oxidases) showed highly inducible transcript regulation, suggesting great adaptive potential for S. avenae on different plants. All the abovementioned genes will be prime candidates for further studies of molecular interactions underlying host plant use and specialization in this aphid. Our results provide insights into aphids' defenses against variable phytochemicals, and the molecular basis underlying aphid-plant interactions as well."

"30688563","abstracttext","The stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici frequently causes significant yield losses in China, due to rapid development of new races that overcome resistance in wheat cultivars. Indirect evidence suggests that sexual reproduction occurs in the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici population in China but direct evidence was still lacking. In this study, a large-scale survey of barberry (Berberis spp.) was conducted in Gansu, Shaanxi, Tibet, and Xinjiang provinces in western China. In total, 9,297 single-aecial (SA) samples were used to inoculate a susceptible wheat cultivar to identify samples of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. Sixteen of the SA samples were identified as P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. When tested on the wheat differentials for identifying P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races, 15 of the 16 SA samples had different virulence patterns, indicating that they were sexually produced through barberry. From the 16 SA samples, 118 single-uredinium (SU) isolates were obtained, from which 88 virulence patterns were identified when tested on 17 Yr single-gene lines. The virulence patterns had relatively narrow virulence spectra, ranging from 0 to 9, with a mean of four virulences per SU isolates. Of the 17 Yr genes, no virulences were detected for Yr5, Yr10, and Yr15; virulences to YrTr1, Yr24, and Yr27 were extremely low (<3%); those to YrSP, Yr9, Yr28, and Yr2 were low (13.6 to 28.0%); those to Yr7, Yr17, Yr8, and YrExp2 were moderate (33.1 to 48.3%); and those to Yr6, Yr44, and Yr25 were high (52.5 to 72.9%). This study provides direct evidence that natural sexual reproduction occurs in the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici population in China, but the frequency appears to be very low. The sexual reproduction on alternate host plants can generate a great virulence diversity, which may have contributed to the high variation in the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici population in China."

"30690994","abstracttext","New races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of stem rust, threaten global wheat production. In particular, races belonging to the Ug99 race group significantly contribute to yield loss in several African nations. Genetic resistance remains the most effective means of controlling this disease. A collection of 546 wheat-intra- and intergeneric hybrids developed by W. J. Sando (United States Department of Agriculture, Beltsville, MD) was screened with eight races of P. graminis f. sp. tritici, including races TTKSK, TTKST, TTTSK, TRTTF, TTTTF, TPMKC, RKQQC, and QTHJC. There were 152 accessions resistant to one or more races and 29 accessions resistant to TTKSK, TTKST, and TTTSK. Of these 29 accessions, 9 were resistant to all races, 14 had infection type patterns that were indistinguishable from cultivars possessing Sr9h and Sr42, 2 were indistinguishable from accessions with SrTmp, and 4 did not display resistant patterns of accessions with any known Sr gene. Three accessions (604981, 605286, and 611932) characterized cytogenetically were disomic substitution lines, each with a single Thinopyrum ponticum chromosome pair. One accession (606057) was a disomic substitution or addition line with two pairs of T. ponticum chromosomes. In total, seven accessions are postulated to contain novel stem rust resistance genes. This research indicates the value of extant collections of wheat-intergeneric hybrids as sources of disease resistance genes."

"31622682","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust, due to infection by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating disease that causes significant global grain yield losses. Yr36, which encodes Wheat Kinase START1 (WKS1), is an effective high-temperature adult-plant resistance gene and confers resistance to a broad spectrum of Pst races. We previously showed that WKS1 phosphorylates the thylakoid ascorbate peroxidase protein and reduces its ability to detoxify peroxides, which may contribute to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). WKS1-mediated Pst resistance is accompanied by leaf chlorosis in Pst-infected regions, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we show that WKS1 interacts with and phosphorylates PsbO, an extrinsic member of photosystem II (PSII), to reduce photosynthesis, regulate leaf chlorosis, and confer Pst resistance. A point mutation in PsbO-A1 or reduction in its transcript levels by RNA interference resulted in chlorosis and reduced Pst sporulation. Biochemical analyses revealed that WKS1 phosphorylates PsbO at two conserved amino acids involved in physical interactions with PSII and reduces the binding affinity of PsbO with PSII. Presumably, phosphorylated PsbO proteins dissociate from the PSII complex and then undergo rapid degradation by cysteine and aspartic proteases. Taken together, these results demonstrate that perturbations of wheat PsbO by point mutation or phosphorylation by WKS1 reduce the rate of photosynthesis and delay the growth of Pst pathogen before the induction of ROS."

"31626626","abstracttext","Filamentous fungi rapidly evolve in response to environmental selection pressures in part due to their genomic plasticity. Parastagonospora nodorum, a fungal pathogen of wheat and causal agent of septoria nodorum blotch, responds to selection pressure exerted by its host, influencing the gain, loss, or functional diversification of virulence determinants, known as effector genes. Whole genome resequencing of 197 P. nodorum isolates collected from spring, durum, and winter wheat production regions of the United States enabled the examination of effector diversity and genomic regions under selection specific to geographically discrete populations. 1,026,859 SNPs/InDels were used to identify novel loci, as well as SnToxA and SnTox3 as factors in disease. Genes displaying presence/absence variation, predicted effector genes, and genes localized on an accessory chromosome had significantly higher pN/pS ratios, indicating a higher rate of sequence evolution. Population structure analyses indicated two P. nodorum populations corresponding to the Upper Midwest (Population 1) and Southern/Eastern United States (Population 2). Prevalence of SnToxA varied greatly between the two populations which correlated with presence of the host sensitivity gene Tsn1 in the most prevalent cultivars in the corresponding regions. Additionally, 12 and 5 candidate effector genes were observed to be under diversifying selection among isolates from Population 1 and 2, respectively, but under purifying selection or neutrally evolving in the opposite population. Selective sweep analysis revealed 10 and 19 regions that had recently undergone positive selection in Population 1 and 2, respectively, involving 92 genes in total. When comparing genes with and without presence/absence variation, those genes exhibiting this variation were significantly closer to transposable elements. Taken together, these results indicate that P. nodorum is rapidly adapting to distinct selection pressures unique to spring and winter wheat production regions by rapid adaptive evolution and various routes of genomic diversification, potentially facilitated through transposable element activity."

"31645419","abstracttext","Exploiting genetically diverse lines to identify genes for improving crop performance is needed to ensure global food security. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted using 46,268 SNP markers on a diverse panel of 143 hexaploid bread and synthetic wheat to identify potential genes/genomic regions controlling agronomic performance (yield and 26 yield-related traits), disease resistance, and grain quality traits. From phenotypic evaluation, we found large genetic variation among the 35 traits and recommended five lines having a high yield, better quality, and multiple disease resistance for direct use in a breeding program. From a GWAS, we identified a total of 243 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) for 35 traits that explained up to 25% of the phenotypic variance. Of these, 120 MTAs have not been reported in the literature and are potentially novel MTAs. In silico gene annotation analysis identified 116 MTAs within genes and of which, 21 MTAs were annotated as a missense variant. Furthermore, we were able to identify 23 co-located multi-trait MTAs that were also phenotypically correlated to each other, showing the possibility of simultaneous improvement of these traits. Additionally, most of the co-located MTAs were within genes. We have provided genomic fingerprinting for significant markers with favorable and unfavorable alleles in the diverse set of lines for developing elite breeding lines from useful trait-integration. The results from this study provided a further understanding of genetically complex traits and would facilitate the use of diverse wheat accessions for improving multiple traits in an elite wheat breeding program."

"31583662","abstracttext","Wheat and barley have large genomes of 15 Gb and 5.1 Gb, respectively, which is much larger than the human genome (3.3 Gb). The release of their respective genomes has been a tremendous advance the understanding of the genome organization and the ability for deeper functional analysis in particular meiosis. Meiosis is the cell division required during sexual reproduction. One major event of meiosis is called recombination, or the formation of crossing over, a tight link between homologous chromosomes, ensuring gene exchange and faithful chromosome segregation. Recombination is a major driver of genetic diversity but in these large genome crops, the vast majority of these events is constrained at the end of their chromosomes. It is estimated that in barley, about 30% of the genes are located within the poor recombining centromeric regions, making important traits, such as resistance to pest and disease for example, difficult to access. Increasing recombination in these crops has the potential to speed up breeding program and requires a good understand of the meiotic mechanism. However, most research on recombination in plant has been carried in Arabidopsis thaliana which despite many of the advantages it brings for plant research, has a small genome and more spread out of recombination compare to barley or wheat. Advance in microscopy and cytological procedures have emerged in the last few years, allowing to follow meiotic events in these crops. This protocol provides the steps required for cytological preparation of barley and wheat pollen mother cells for light microscopy, highlighting some of the differences between the two cereals."

"31329816","abstracttext_methods","Among 323 wheat accessions, we investigated phenotypic differences in root traits at booting and mid-grain fill stages in PVC tubes, shoot traits including plant height (PH), canopy temperature (CT) and grain yield per plant (YPP) in a field experiment, and performed a genome-wide association study with a Wheat 660K SNP Array."
"31329816","abstracttext_key results","Deep-rooted accessions had lower CT and higher YPP than those with shallow roots, but no significant relationship was identified between root dry weight and shoot traits. Ninety-three significantly associated loci (SALs) were detected by the mixed linear model, among which three were hub SALs (Co-6A, Co-6B and Co-6D) associated with root depth at both booting and mid-grain fill stages, as well as CT and YPP. Minirhizotron system scanning results suggested that the causal genes in the three SALs may regulate root elongation in the field. The heritable independence between root depth and PH was demonstrated by linkage disequilibrium analysis. The YPP was significantly higher in genotypes which combined favourable marker alleles (FMAs) for root depth and PH, suggesting that a deep root and shorter plant height are suitable traits for pyramiding target alleles by molecular marker-assisted breeding."

"31322491","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici , is one of the most devastating wheat diseases in Ethiopia. To study virulence genetics of the pathogen, 117 progeny isolates were produced through sexual reproduction of an Ethiopian isolate of the stripe rust pathogen on Berberis holstii plants under controlled conditions. The parental and progeny isolates were characterized by phenotyping on wheat lines carrying single Yr genes for resistance and genotyped using 10 polymorphic simple sequence repeated (SSR) markers. The progeny isolates were classified into 37 virulence phenotypes and 75 multilocus genotypes. The parental isolate and progeny isolates were all avirulent to resistance genes Yr5 , Yr10 , Yr15 , Yr24 , Yr32 , YrTr1 , YrSP , and Yr76 but virulent to Yr1 and Yr2 , indicating that the parental isolate was homozygous avirulent or homozygous virulent at these loci. The progeny isolates segregated for virulence to 12 Yr genes. Virulence phenotypes to Yr6 , Yr28 , Yr43 , and Yr44 were controlled by a single dominant gene; those to Yr7 , Yr9 , Yr17 , Yr27 , Yr25 , Yr31 , and YrExp2 were each controlled by two dominant genes; and the virulence phenotype to Yr8 was controlled by two complementary dominant genes. A linkage map was constructed with seven SSR markers, and 16 virulence loci corresponding to 11 Yr resistance genes were mapped with some loci linked to each other. These results are useful in understanding host-pathogen interactions and selecting resistance genes to develop wheat cultivars with highly effective resistance to stripe rust."

The GWAS panel was phenotyped for seedling resistance to tan spot with Ptr race 1 in two greenhouse experiments. Besides CIMMYT germplasm, several lines from South Asia (India, Bangladesh and Nepal) showed good degree of resistance to tan spot. Association mapping was conducted separately for individual experiments and for pooled data using mixed linear model (MLM) and Fixed and random model Circulating Probability Unification (FarmCPU) model; no significant MTAs were recorded through the MLM model, whereas FarmCPU model reported nine significant MTAs located on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2B, 3B, 4A, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 7D. The long arms of chromosomes 5A and 5B were consistent across both environments, in which the Vrn-A1 locus was found in identified region of chromosome 5A, and MTA at IACX9261 on 5BL appears to represent the resistance gene tsn 1 .

"32991158","abstracttext","In addition to their fungicidal activity, many triazole fungicides function as plant regulators, which might impose adverse effects on the growth and development of crops. For chiral triazole fungicides, these effects can be alleviated by applying stereoisomers with high fungicidal and low regulator activities. This study investigated the stereoselectivity of four stereoisomers and the racemate of metconazole (2.5 g/100 kg seeds) on emergence and growth of seedlings (BBCH 01-14) in wheat. Wheat seedlings, coated with cis -1 S ,5 R -metconazole, had a significantly lower seedling emergence ratio and shoot length than other metconazole treatments; however, the opposite effects were observed in the trans -1 S ,5 S -metconazole treatment. With regard to the hormonal level, enzyme activity, and gene transcription of gibberellin (GA) and jasmonic acid (JA), cis -1 S ,5 R -metconazole treatment inhibited GA biosynthesis while trans -1 S ,5 S -metconazole treatment promoted GA biosynthesis. Moreover, cis -1 S ,5 R -metconazole, trans -1 S ,5 S -metconazole, trans -1 R ,5 R -metconazole, and racemate treatments increased JA biosynthesis. The oxidative stress responses in trans -1 R ,5 R -metconazole and racemate treatments were more intensive. Therefore, compared with the control, treatment with cis -1 R ,5 S -metcoanzole exhibited minimal influence on wheat seedling growth. The results showed that the application of pure cis -1 R ,5 S -metcoanzole (instead of the racemate) in agricultural management could decrease the risks associated with crop growth and developmental damage."

"32877878","abstracttext","Heavy metal pollution as well as improper fertilization management represent serious threats to a clean environment and healthy food. This study was conducted to investigate how nitrogen supply influences a plant's ability to cope with cadmium stress in the two wheat cultivars - the modern cv. Katya (carrier of the semi-dwarfing gene Rht8) and the old cv. Slomer. Here we examined the effects of 100 μM CdCl 2 on both wheat genotypes grown hydroponically under three different nutrition regimes of 5.5, 10 and 20 mM NO 3 - by investigating plant growth, pigment content and the functional activity of the photosynthetic apparatus through a combination of PAM chlorophyll fluorescence, P700 photooxidation, oxygen evolution and oxidative stress markers. Data showed that the different genetic background affects the different strategies for metal uptake and allocation, as well as abilities to deal with oxidative stress. The modern cv. Katya restricts the entry of the metal to the roots, but allows its translocation to the shoots. Nevertheless, the photosynthetic performance indicated better protection, possibly mediated by the Rht8 allele. In contrast, the old cv. Slomer tolerates higher cadmium levels in roots and possesses efficient barriers against its transfer to the shoots, but still showed more impaired photosynthetic activity. In general, the impact of cadmium on the photosynthetic apparatus was most deleterious under the lowest nitrogen concentration which was applied, while the highest nitrogen supply alleviated the negative effects of cadmium. The data suggest that the modern breeding allele (Rht8), as well as a better nutrition might contribute to the tolerance to heavy metal stress in the wheat."

"33157204","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a destructive fungal disease of wheat globally. Breeding resistance cultivars is one of the most cost-effective methods to control Pst. Shumai126 (SM126), a high-yielding commercial wheat cultivar, showed strong stripe rust resistance for more than ten years. However, the molecular mechanisms and the responsive genes underlying the SM126 resistance to Pst have not been explored yet. In the present study, RNA-seq was used to analyze changes in the transcriptome at different time points of Pst infection in seedling leaves of SM126. In total, 520, 148 and 1439 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be up- or down-regulated after Pst infection at 1, 3, and 7 days post inoculation, respectively. The majority of DEGs exhibited transient expression patterns during Pst infection at different time points. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that many biological processes, such as photosynthesis, flavonoid biosynthesis, oxidative phosphorylation, MAPK signaling pathway, and phenylalanine metabolism are involved in SM126 response to Pst. Expression of genes involved in the plant-pathogen interaction pathway was detected and some key genes showed differential expression. DEGs encoded R proteins and transcription factors were also identified. Our study suggests the gene resources in SM126 related to stripe rust response could be valuable for understanding the mechanisms involved in stripe rust resistance and improvement of wheat resistance to Pst."

Identification of genes underlying the regulation of wheat heading and the development of diagnostic markers could facilitate our understanding of genetic control of this process."
"32660420","abstracttext_results","In this study, we developed 400 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) by crossing a γ-ray-induced early heading mutant (eh1) with the late heading cultivar, Lunxuan987. Bulked Segregant Analysis (BSA) of both RNA and DNA pools consisting of various RILs detected a quantitative trait loci (QTL) for heading date located on chromosomes 5B, and further genetic linkage analysis limited the QTL to a 3.31 cM region. We then identified a large deletion in the first intron of the vernalization gene VRN-B1 in eh1, and showed it was associated with the heading phenotype in the RIL population. However, it is not the mutation loci that resulted in early heading phonotype in the mutant compared to that of wildtype. RNA-seq analysis suggested that Vrn-B3 and several newly discovered genes, including beta-amylase 1 (BMY1) and anther-specific protein (RTS), were highly expressed in both the mutant and early heading pool with the dominant Vrn-B1 genotype compared to that of Lunxuan987 and late heading pool.

To unravel the genetic architecture of stripe rust resistance, seedlings of 161 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross Avocet S × SN33 were evaluated with two isolates (PST-Lab.1 and PST-Lab.2) of the stripe rust pathogen (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) in the greenhouse, and the RILs were evaluated in naturally and/or artificially inoculated field sites during two cropping seasons. The RILs and parents were genotyped with the wheat 55K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array. Three genomic regions conferring seedling resistance were mapped on chromosomes 1DS, 2AS, and 3DS, and four consistent quantitative trait loci (QTL) for adult-plant resistance (APR) were detected on 1BL, 2AS, 3DL, and 6BS. The 2AS locus conferring all-stage resistance was identified as the resistant gene Yr17 located on 2NS translocation. The QTL identified on 1BL and 6BS likely correspond to Yr29 and Yr78, respectively. An APR QTL on 3DL explaining 5.8-12.2% of the phenotypic variation is likely to be new. Molecular marker detection assays with the 2NS segment (Yr17), Yr29, Yr78, and QYrsn.nwafu-3DL on a panel of 420 current Chinese wheat cultivars and breeding lines indicated that these genes were present in 11.4%, 7.6%, 14.8%, and 7.4% entries, respectively. The interactions among these genes/QTL were additive suggesting their potential value in enhancing stripe rust resistance breeding materials as observed in the resistant parent. In addition, we also identified two leaf necrosis genes, Ne1 and Ne2, however, the F1 plants from cross Avocet S × SN33 survived indicating that SN33 probably has another allele of Ne1 which allows to harvest seeds."

"33244607","abstracttext","Bread wheat is a major crop that has long been the focus of basic and breeding research. Assembly of its genome has been difficult because of its large size and allohexaploid nature (AABBDD genome). Following the first reported assembly of the genome of the experimental strain Chinese Spring (CS), the 10+ Wheat Genomes Project was launched to produce multiple assemblies of worldwide modern cultivars. The only Asian cultivar in the project is Norin 61, a representative Japanese cultivar adapted to grow across a broad latitudinal range, mostly characterized by a wet climate and a short growing season. Here, we characterize key aspects of its chromosome-scale genome assembly spanning 15 Gb with a raw scaffold N50 of 23 Mb. Analysis of the repetitive elements identified chromosomal regions unique to Norin 61 that encompass a tandem array of the pathogenesis-related-13 family. We report novel copy-number variations in the B homeolog of the florigen gene FT1/VRN3, pseudogenization of its D homeolog, and the association of its A homeologous alleles with the spring/winter growth habit. Further, the Norin 61 genome carries typical East Asian functional variants from CS ranging from a single nucleotide to multi-Mb scale. Examples of such variation are the Fhb1 locus, which confers Fusarium head-blight resistance, Ppd-D1a, which confers early flowering, Glu-D1f for Asian noodle quality, and Rht-D1b, which introduced semi-dwarfism during the green revolution. The adoption of Norin 61 as a reference assembly for functional and evolutionary studies will enable comprehensive characterization of the underexploited Asian bread wheat diversity."

"10336628","abstracttext","CYP51s form the only family of P450 proteins conserved in evolution from prokaryotes to fungi, plants and mammals. In all eukaryotes, CYP51s catalyse 14alpha-demethylation of sterols. We have recently isolated two CYP51 cDNAs from sorghum [Bak, S., Kahn, R.A., Olsen, C. E. & Halkier, B.A. (1997) Plant J. 11, 191-201] and wheat [Cabello-Hurtado, F., Zimmerlin, A., Rahier, A., Taton, M., DeRose, R., Nedelkina, S., Batard, Y., Durst, F., Pallett, K.E. & Werck-Reichhart, D. (1997) Biophys. Biochem. Res. Commun. 230, 381-385]. Wheat and sorghum CYP51 proteins show a high identity (92%) compared with their identity with their fungal and mammalian orthologues (32-39%). Data obtained with plant microsomes have previously suggested that differences in primary sequences reflect differences in sterol pathways and CYP51 substrate specificities between animals, fungi and plants. To investigate more thoroughly the properties of the plant CYP51, the wheat enzyme was expressed in yeast strains overexpressing different P450 reductases as a fusion with either yeast or plant (sorghum) membrane targeting sequences. The endogenous sterol demethylase gene (ERG11) was then disrupted. A sorghum-wheat fusion protein expressed with the Arabidopsis thaliana reductase ATR1 showed the highest level of expression and activity. The expression induced a marked proliferation of microsomal membranes so as to obtain 70 nmol P450.(L culture)-1, with CYP51 representing 1.5% of microsomal protein. Without disruption of the ERG11 gene, the expression level was fivefold reduced. CYP51 from wheat complemented the ERG11 disruption, as the modified yeasts did not need supplementation with exogenous ergosterol and grew normally under aerobic conditions. The fusion plant enzyme catalysed 14alpha-demethylation of obtusifoliol very actively (Km,app = 197 microm, kcat = 1.2 min-1) and with very strict substrate specificity. No metabolism of lanosterol and eburicol, the substrates of the fungal and mammalian CYP51s, nor metabolism of herbicides and fatty acids was detected in the recombinant yeast microsomes. Surprisingly lanosterol (Ks = 2.2 microM) and eburicol (Ks = 2.5 microm) were found to bind the active site of the plant enzyme with affinities higher than that for obtusifoliol (Ks = 289 microM), giving typical type-I spectra. The amplitudes of these spectra, however, suggested that lanosterol and eburicol were less favourably positioned to be metabolized than obtusifoliol. The recombinant enzyme was also used to test the relative binding constants of two azole compounds, LAB170250F and gamma-ketotriazole, which were previously reported to be potent inhibitors of the plant enzyme. The Ks of plant CYP51 for LAB170250F (0.29 microM) and gamma-ketotriazole (0.40 microM) calculated from the type-II sp2 nitrogen-binding spectra were in better agreement with their reported effects as plant CYP51 inhibitors than values previously determined with plant microsomes. This optimized expression system thus provides an excellent tool for detailed enzymological and mechanistic studies, and for improving the selectivity of inhibitory molecules."
"10938796","articletitle","Root hydraulic conductance: diurnal aquaporin expression and the effects of nutrient stress."
"10938796","abstracttext","It has been shown that N-, P- and S-deficiencies result in major reductions of root hydraulic conductivity (Lpr) which may lead to lowered stomatal conductance, but the relationship between the two conductance changes is not understood. In a variety of species, Lpr decreases in the early stages of NO3-, H2PO4(2-) and SO4(2-) deprivation. These effects can be reversed in 4-24 h after the deficient nutrient is re-supplied. Diurnal fluctuations of root Lpr have also been found in some species, and an example of this is given for Lotus japonicus. In nutrient-sufficient wheat plants, root Lpr is extremely sensitive to brief treatments with HgCl2; these effects are completely reversible when Hg is removed. The low values of Lpr in N- or P-deprived roots of wheat are not affected by Hg treatments. The properties of plasma membrane (PM) vesicles from wheat roots are also affected by NO3(-)-deprivation of the intact plants. The osmotic permeability of vesicles from N-deprived roots is much lower than that of roots adequately supplied with NO3-, and is insensitive to Hg treatment. In roots of L. japonicus, gene transcripts are found which have a strong homology to those encoding the PIP1 and PIP2 aquaporins of Arabidopsis. There is a very marked diurnal cycle in the abundance of mRNAs of aquaporin gene homologues in roots of L. japonicus. The maxima and minima appear to anticipate the diurnal fluctuations in Lpr by 2-4 h. The temporal similarity between the cycles of the abundance of the mRNAs and root Lpr is most striking. The aquaporin encoded by AtPIP1 is known to have its water permeation blocked by Hg binding. The lack of Hg-sensitivity in roots and PMs from N-deprived roots provides circumstantial evidence that lowered root Lpr may be due to a decrease in either the activity of water channels or their density in the PM. It is concluded that roots are capable, by means completely unknown, of monitoring the nutrient content of the solution in the root apoplasm and of initiating responses that anticipate by hours or days any metabolic disturbances caused by nutrient deficiencies. It is the incoming nutrient supply that is registered as deficient, not the plant's nutrient status. At some point, close to the initiation of these responses, changes in water channel activity may be involved, but the manner in which monitoring of nutrient stress is transduced into an hydraulic response is also unknown."

"18943991","abstracttext","ABSTRACT This study describes the segregation of genes for resistance to the fungus Puccinia triticina in a cross between partially resistant wheat lines L-574-1 and CI 13227 with two and four genes for resistance, respectively. The objectives of this study were to use parental, F(1), F(2), and backcross populations to quantify maternal effects, degree of dominance, and transgressive segregation, and to determine whether CI 13227 and L-574-1 share any resistance genes for long latent period or small uredinia. In two experiments conducted in the greenhouse, the uppermost leaf of adult wheat plants was inoculated prior to heading with P. triticina. On days 6 to 21 after inoculation, the number of uredinia that erupted from the leaf surface was counted and used to calculate the mean latent period (MLP). The length and width of five arbitrarily selected uredinia were measured and used to calculate uredinium area. Midparent values, degree of dominance, and broad-sense heritability were calculated for MLP and uredinium area. For experiment A, MLP values for CI 13227, L-574-1, F(1), and F(2) generations were 12.2, 10.5, 10.2, and 10.6 days, respectively. For experiment B, MLP values for CI 13227, L-574-1, F(1), F(2), backcross to CI 13227, and backcross to L-574-1 were 12.3, 10.0, 10.6, 10.8, 11.1, and 10.0 days, respectively. The inheritance of long latent period was partially recessive, and no maternal effect was present (P = 0.62 to 0.87 for the comparison of means in reciprocal crosses). Broad-sense heritability for MLP ranged from 0.72 to 0.74, and there was transgressive segregation in the F(2) and backcross populations. Uredinia of the F(1) generation were slightly larger than uredinia for CI 13227. The inheritance of uredinium size was partially dominant, and no maternal effect was present (P = 0.5 to 0.63). Broad-sense heritability for uredinium area ranged from 0.36 to 0.73 and transgressive segregation was present in the F(2) and backcross populations. The results for MLP indicate that lines CI 13227 and L-574 likely share one gene for resistance (based on F(1) values) but not two genes (based on the presence of transgressive segregation). CI 13227 and L 574-1 appear to have at least one gene difference for uredinium area. The linear relationship between uredinium area regressed onto MLP was significant (P < 0.001) and r(2) values ranged from 0.14 to 0.26. These results indicate that the resistance in CI 13227 and L-574-1 could be combined to create wheat cultivars with greater partial resistance than that possessed by either parent based on MLP or uredinium size."
"30538717","articletitle","Potential Root Foraging Strategy of Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) for Potassium Heterogeneity."
"30538717","abstracttext","Potassium (K) distribution is horizontally heterogeneous under the conservation agriculture approach of no-till with strip fertilization. The root foraging strategy of wheat for K heterogeneity is poorly understood. In this study, WinRHIZO, microarray, Non-invasive Micro-test Technology (NMT) and a split-root system were performed to investigate root morphology, gene expression profiling and fluxes of K + and O 2 under K heterogeneity and homogeneity conditions. The split-root system was performed as follows: C. LK (both compartments had low K), C. NK (both compartments had normal K), Sp. LK (one compartment had low K) and Sp. NK (the other compartment had normal K). The ratio of total root length and root tips in Sp. NK was significantly higher than that in C. NK, while no significant differences were found between Sp. LK and C. LK. Differential expression genes in C. LK vs. C. NK had opposite responses in Sp. LK vs. C. LK and similar responses in Sp. NK vs. C. NK. Low-K responsive genes, such as peroxidases, mitochondrion, transcription factor activity, calcium ion binding, glutathione transferase and cellular respiration genes were found to be up-regulated in Sp. NK. However, methyltransferase activity, protein amino acid phosphorylation, potassium ion transport, and protein kinase activity genes were found to be down-regulated in Sp. LK. The up-regulated gene with function in respiration tended to increase K + uptake through improving O 2 influx on the root surface in Sp. NK, while the down-regulated genes with functions of K + and O 2 transport tended to reduce K + uptake on the root surface in Sp. LK. To summarize, wheat roots tended to perform active-foraging strategies in Sp. NK and dormant-foraging strategies in Sp. LK through the following patterns: (1) root development in Sp. NK but not in Sp. LK; (2) low-K responsive genes, such as peroxidases, mitochondrion, transcription factor activity, calcium ion binding and respiration, were up-regulated in Sp. NK but not in Sp. LK; and (3) root K + and O 2 influxes increased in Sp. NK but not in Sp. LK. Our findings may better explain the optimal root foraging strategy for wheat grown with heterogeneous K distribution in the root zone."

Of the identified genes, 110 OsbHLHs, 188 ZmbHLHs and 209 TabHLHs with relatively high mRNA abundances were detected in one or more tissues during development, and some of them exhibited tissue-specific expression such as TabHLH454-459, ZmbHLH099-101 and OsbHLH037 in root, TabHLH559-562, - 046, - 047 and ZmbHLH010, - 072, - 226 in leaf, TabHLH216-221, - 333, - 335, - 340 and OsbHLH005, - 141 in inflorescence, TabHLH081, ZmbHLH139 and OsbHLH144 in seed. Forty five, twenty nine and thirty one differentially expressed bHLHs were respectively detected in wheat, maize and rice under drought stresses using RNA-seq technology. Among them, the expressions of TabHLH046, - 047, ZmbHLH097, - 098, OsbHLH006 and - 185 were strongly induced, whereas TabHLH303, - 562, ZmbHLH155, - 154, OsbHLH152 and - 113 showed significant down-regulation. Twenty two TabHLHs were induced after stripe rust infection at 24 h and nine of them were suppressed at 72 hpi, whereas 28 and 6 TabHLHs exhibited obviously down- and up-regulation after powdery mildew attack respectively. Forty one ZmbHLHs were differentially expressed in response to F. verticillioides infection. Twenty two co-expression modules were identified by the WGCNA, some of which were associated with particular tissue types. And GO enrichment analysis for the modules showed that some TabHLHs were involved in the control of several biological processes, such as tapetal PCD, lipid metabolism, iron absorption, stress responses and signal regulation."

"19848086","abstracttext","The aim of this investigation was to determine the presence of the opportunistic pathogen Clostridium perfringens by PCR and DNA sequencing, without previous cultivation. This methodology was then used to investigate how C. perfringens was affected by different preventive measures, such as ionophores and feed additives, for necrotic enteritis in broilers chickens. DNA was extracted from the intestinal content or intestinal tissue by DNA extraction kits. Detection limits for 16S rRNA, alpha-toxin, and cpb2 PCR gene targets were approximately 1 x 10(3), 5 x 10(4), and 1 x 10(6) cells per g of intestinal content or tissue, respectively, as determined with samples spiked with C. perfringens. The method was evaluated with samples from single conventional broilers or from pools of six birds of experimentally reared broilers. Conventional chickens, raised with salinomycin in their feed, showed reduced numbers of C. perfringens-positive samples (P < 0.05) for all three PCR tests. With respect to cpb2, a tendency to detect more samples as positive for C. perfringens was observed with increasing age. The addition of sodium butyrate and lactic acid in the feed for experimental birds had a minor effect (P < 0.10) on positive samples, as detected with the 16S rRNA PCR. For experimental birds fed whole wheat, only three out of six pools of six birds allowed detection of C. perfringens by the 16S rRNA PCR, compared to five for the untreated controls or the Avilamycin- or prebiotic-treated birds. All 16S rRNA partial gene sequences obtained were identical and were 99.5% similar to the rrnB gene of the type strain of C. perfringens. Two types of the partial cpb2 gene sequence were detected with a similarity of 93%. One type was translated into protein, whereas a stop codon was found in the other type. Both types were located in the ""atypical"" phylogenetic group of the cpb2 gene sequences. The PCR test, based on extraction of DNA from intestinal content, provided rapid screening of poultry for C. perfringens without the need to have access to facilities in order to immediately cultivate and identify bacteria at the location of sampling. Further work is suggested to determine the relationship between the degree of necrotic enteritis, the actual level of C. perfringens in the animal, and the detection achieved by PCR."

"22985436","abstracttext_background","MADS-box genes constitute a large family of transcription factors functioning as key regulators of many processes during plant vegetative and reproductive development. Type II MADS-box genes have been intensively investigated and are mostly involved in vegetative and flowering development. A growing number of studies of Type I MADS-box genes in Arabidopsis, have assigned crucial roles for these genes in gamete and seed development and have demonstrated that a number of Type I MADS-box genes are epigenetically regulated by DNA methylation and histone modifications. However, reports on agronomically important cereals such as barley and wheat are scarce."
"22985436","abstracttext_results","Here we report the identification and characterization of two Type I-like MADS-box genes, from barley (Hordeum vulgare), a monocot cereal crop of high agronomic importance. Protein sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that the putative proteins are related to Type I MADS-box proteins, and classified them in a distinct cereal clade. Significant differences in gene expression among seed developmental stages and between barley cultivars with varying seed size were revealed for both genes. One of these genes was shown to be induced by the seed development- and stress-related hormones ABA and JA whereas in situ hybridizations localized the other gene to specific endosperm sub-compartments. The genomic organization of the latter has high conservation with the cereal Type I-like MADS-box homologues and the chromosomal position of both genes is close to markers associated with seed quality traits. DNA methylation differences are present in the upstream and downstream regulatory regions of the barley Type I-like MADS-box genes in two different developmental stages and in response to ABA treatment which may be associated with gene expression differences."
"22985436","abstracttext_conclusions","Two barley MADS-box genes were studied that are related to Type I MADS-box genes. Differential expression in different seed developmental stages as well as in barley cultivars with different seed size was evidenced for both genes. The two barley Type I MADS-box genes were found to be induced by ABA and JA. DNA methylation differences in different seed developmental stages and after exogenous application of ABA is suggestive of epigenetic regulation of gene expression. The study of barley Type I-like MADS-box genes extends our investigations of gene regulation during endosperm and seed development in a monocot crop like barley."

"29673315","abstracttext_results","Using shotgun sequencing, a 38,660,329 bp F. venenatum genome was assembled into four chromosomes, and a 78,618 bp mitochondrial genome. In comparison to F. graminearum, the predicted gene count of 13,946 was slightly lower. The F. venenatum centromeres were found to be 25% smaller compared to F. graminearum. Chromosome length was 2.8% greater in F. venenatum, primarily due to an increased abundance of repetitive elements and transposons, but not transposon diversity. On chromosome 3 a major sequence rearrangement was found, but its overall gene content was relatively unchanged. Unlike homothallic F. graminearum, heterothallic F. venenatum possessed the MAT1-1 type locus, but lacked the MAT1-2 locus. The F. venenatum genome has the type A trichothecene mycotoxin TRI5 cluster, whereas F. graminearum has type B. From the F. venenatum gene set, 786 predicted proteins were species-specific versus NCBI. The annotated F. venenatum genome was predicted to possess more genes coding for hydrolytic enzymes and species-specific genes involved in the breakdown of polysaccharides than F. graminearum. Comparison of the two genomes reduced the previously defined F. graminearum-specific gene set from 741 to 692 genes. A comparison of the F. graminearum versus F. venenatum proteomes identified 15 putative secondary metabolite gene clusters (SMC), 109 secreted proteins and 38 candidate effectors not found in F. venenatum. Five of the 15 F. graminearum-specific SMCs that were either absent or highly divergent in the F. venenatum genome showed increased in planta expression. In addition, two predicted F. graminearum transcription factors previously shown to be required for fungal virulence on wheat plants were absent or exhibited high sequence divergence."

"30568667","abstracttext","Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ( Pgt ) is an economically important disease of wheat and barley. Rpg1 is the only resistance gene deployed in Midwestern US barley varieties and provides remarkable resistance to most North American races, except Pgt race QCCJB. Rpg1 is also ineffective against Pgt race TTKSK and its lineage that originated in Africa. The barley rpg4 -mediated resistance locus (RMRL) conferring resistance to Pgt races QCCJB and TTKSK was isolated from line Q21861, which is resistant to all known Pgt races due to Rpg1 and RMRL. To develop elite barley varieties RMRL was pyramided into the varieties, Pinnacle and Conlon (both contain Rpg1 ), producing the near isogenic lines (NILs), Pinnacle RMRL-NIL (PRN) and Conlon RMRL-NIL (CRN). The CRN was resistant to Pgt races QCCJB (RMRL specific) and HKHJC ( Rpg1 specific) at the seedling stage and Pgt race TTKSK (RMRL specific) at the adult stage. In contrast, PRN was susceptible to QCCJB and HKHJC at the seedling stage and TTKSK at the adult stage. Interestingly, PRN's susceptibility to QCCJB and HKHJC showed that RMRL was non-functional in the Pinnacle background but its presence also suppressed Rpg1 -mediated resistance. Thus, in the absence of a gene/s found in the Q21861 background, Rpg1 becomes non-functional if RMRL is present, suggesting that another polymorphic gene, that we designated Rrr1 (required for rpg4 -mediated resistance 1), is required for RMRL resistance and Rpg1 -mediated resistance in the presence of RMRL. Utilizing a PRN/Q21861 derived recombinant inbred line (RIL) population, Rrr1 was delimited to a ∼0.5 MB physical region, slightly proximal (∼1.8 MB) of RMRL on barley chromosome 5H. A second gene, designated required for Rpg1 -mediated resistance 2 ( Rrr2 ), with duplicate gene action to Rrr1 in Rpg1 -mediated resistance function, was genetically delimited to a physical region of ∼0.7 MB, slightly distal (∼3.1 MB) to Rpg1 on the short arm of barley chromosome 7H. Thus, Rrr1 is required for RMRL resistance and Rrr1 or Rrr2 is required for functional Rpg1 -mediated resistance in the presence of the RMRL introgression. Candidate Rrr1 and Rrr2 genes were identified that need to be considered when pyramiding Rpg1 and RMRL in barley."

"12054857","abstracttext","Discovery of a number of novel and known human genes whose protein products bear striking similarity to two or more wheat gliadin domains raised the possibility that human intestinal non-HLA peptides homologous to celiac T-cell epitopes could play a role in non-HLA gene specification in celiac disease. Database searching of the entire human genome identified only 11 gut-expressed proteins with high T-cell epitope homology, particularly to the DQ2-gamma-I-gliadin epitope (i.e. TFIIA, FOXJ2 and IgD; mean BestFit quality score=40 versus random value of 24). Others were similar to DQ2-alpha-I-gliadin (i.e. PAX9; BestFit quality 46 versus 20 for random), or DQ2-alpha-II-gliadin (PHLDA1, known in mice as the T-cell death-associated gene; BestFit quality 43 versus 30 for random) epitopes. Among proteins previously screened for gliadin homology, noteworthy was achaete scute homologous protein (DQ2-alpha-I-gliadin; BestFit quality 41 versus 22 for random). With the exception of IgD, all are nuclear factors. Paying particular attention to the position of potential major histocompatibility complex (MHC) anchor residues, several were selected for testing in a DQ2-gamma-I-gliadin-restricted T-cell system. All native 10-mer peptides were inactive, even when deamidated, but V96F substitution of deamidated TFIIA amino acid residues 91-100 stimulated IL-2 release at levels exceeding the wheat gliadin positive control. Also active, but only slightly, was L1009F substitution of AIB3 amino acid residues 1004-1013. PlotSimilarity alignment of TFIIAs from eight species revealed subthreshold similarity score in the peptide region, in contrast to the highly conserved amino and carboxy termini. Molecular modeling of TFIIA[V96F] peptide points to an important juxtaposition of an upwardly projecting phenylalanine residue at peptide position 6 that likely contacts a receptor complementarity-determining region, and a downwardly projecting glutamic acid residue that fits into the shallow MHC P7 pocket. These observations tentatively point to a new multi-gene hypothesis for the initiation of celiac disease in which deamidated free human peptides with T-cell epitope homology (particularly those made more homologous by mutation) escape negative selection, as per deamidation of the HEL(48-62) peptide in the hen egg lysozyme model of autoimmunity. Deamidation following peptide release due to injury triggers inflammation, thereafter repeatedly provoked by dietary gliadin immunodominant peptides concentrated in the proximal small intestine."

In total, 12 Lantang gilts (58.7±0.37 kg) were randomly divided into two dietary groups (six replicates (pigs) per group) and fed either LFD (NDF=201.46 g/kg) or HFD (NDF=329.70 g/kg). Wheat bran was the main source of fiber for the LFD, whereas ground rice hull (mixture of rice hull and rice bran) was used for the HFD. Results showed that the methanogens in the hindgut of Lantang gilts belonged to four known species (Methanobrevibacter ruminantium, Methanobrevibacter wolinii, Methanosphaera stadtmanae and Methanobrevibacter smithii), with about 89% of the methanogens belonging to the genus Methanobrevibacter. The 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene copies of Methanobrevibacter were more than three times higher (P0.05) was observed in 16S rRNA gene copies of Fibrobacter succinogenes between the two dietary groups, and 18S rRNA gene copies of anaerobic fungi in gilts fed LFD were lower than (P<0.05) those fed HFD. To better explain the effect of different fiber source on the methanogen community, a follow-up in vitro fermentation using a factorial design comprised of two inocula (prepared from hindgut content of gilts fed two diets differing in their dietary fiber)×four substrates (LFD, HFD, wheat bran, ground rice hull) was conducted. Results of the in vitro fermentation confirmed that the predominant methanogens belonged to the genus of Methanobrevibacter, and about 23% methanogens was found to be distantly related (90%) to Thermogymnomonas acidicola. In vitro fermentation also seems to suggest that fiber source did change the methanogens community. Although the density of Methanobrevibacter species was positively correlated with CH4 production in both in vivo (P<0.01, r=0.737) and in vitro trials (P<0.05, r=0.854), which could partly explain the higher methane production from gilts fed LFD compared with those in the HFD group. Further investigation is needed to explain how the rice hull affected the methanogens and inhibited CH4 emission from gilts fed HFD."

"29085913","abstracttext","The ascomycete Zymoseptoria tritici is the causal agent of Septoria leaf blotch on wheat. Disease control relies mainly on resistant wheat cultivars and on fungicide applications. The fungus displays a high potential to circumvent both methods. Resistance against all unisite fungicides has been observed over decades. A different type of resistance has emerged among wild populations with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. Active fungicide efflux through overexpression of the major facilitator gene MFS1 explains this emerging resistance mechanism. Applying a bulk-progeny sequencing approach, we identified in this study a 519-bp long terminal repeat (LTR) insert in the MFS1 promoter, a relic of a retrotransposon cosegregating with the MDR phenotype. Through gene replacement, we show the insert as a mutation responsible for MFS1 overexpression and the MDR phenotype. Besides this type I insert, we found two different types of promoter inserts in more recent MDR strains. Type I and type II inserts harbor potential transcription factor binding sites, but not the type III insert. Interestingly, all three inserts correspond to repeated elements present at different genomic locations in either IPO323 or other Z. tritici strains. These results underline the plasticity of repeated elements leading to fungicide resistance in Z. tritici and which contribute to its adaptive potential. IMPORTANCE Disease control through fungicides remains an important means to protect crops from fungal diseases and to secure the harvest. Plant-pathogenic fungi, especially Zymoseptoria tritici , have developed resistance against most currently used active ingredients, reducing or abolishing their efficacy. While target site modification is the most common resistance mechanism against single modes of action, active efflux of multiple drugs is an emerging phenomenon in fungal populations reducing additionally fungicides' efficacy in multidrug-resistant strains. We have investigated the mutations responsible for increased drug efflux in Z. tritici field strains. Our study reveals that three different insertions of repeated elements in the same promoter lead to multidrug resistance in Z. tritici . The target gene encodes the membrane transporter MFS1 responsible for drug efflux, with the promoter inserts inducing its overexpression. These results underline the plasticity of repeated elements leading to fungicide resistance in Z. tritici ."

"31452680","abstracttext_results","In this study, we engineered Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius NCIMB 11955 to utilise lignocellulosic biomass, in the form of nitric acid/ammonia treated wheat straw to which expensive hydrolytic enzymes had not been added. Two different strains, BZ9 and BZ10, were generated by integrating the cglT (β-1,4-glucosidase) gene from Thermoanaerobacter brockii into the genome, and localising genes encoding different cellulolytic enzymes on autonomous plasmids. The plasmid of strain BZ10 carried a synthetic cellulosomal operon comprising the celA (Endoglucanase A) gene from Clostridium thermocellum and cel6B (Exoglucanase) from Thermobifida fusca ; whereas, strain BZ9 contained a plasmid encoding the celA (multidomain cellulase) gene from Caldicellulosiruptor bescii . All of the genes were successfully expressed, and their encoded products secreted in a functionally active form, as evidenced by their detection in culture supernatants by Western blotting and enzymatic assay. In the case of the C. bescii CelA enzyme, this is one of the first times that the heterologous production of this multi-functional enzyme has been achieved in a heterologous host. Both strains (BZ9 and BZ10) exhibited improved growth on pre-treated wheat straw, achieving a higher final OD600 and producing greater numbers of viable cells. To demonstrate that cellulosic ethanol can be produced directly from lignocellulosic biomass by a single organism, we established our consortium of hydrolytic enzymes in a previously engineered ethanologenic G. thermoglucosidasius strain, LS242. We observed approximately twofold and 1.6-fold increase in ethanol production in the recombinant G. thermoglucosidasius equivalent to BZ9 and BZ10, respectively, compared to G. thermoglucosidasius LS242 strain at 24 h of growth."

"16842621","abstracttext_background","Many mitochondrial genes, especially ribosomal protein genes, have been frequently transferred as functional entities to the nucleus during plant evolution, often by an RNA-mediated process. A notable case of transfer involves the rps14 gene of three grasses (rice, maize, and wheat), which has been relocated to the intron of the nuclear sdh2 gene and which is expressed and targeted to the mitochondrion via alternative splicing and usage of the sdh2 targeting peptide. Although this transfer occurred at least 50 million years ago, i.e., in a common ancestor of these three grasses, it is striking that expressed, nearly intact pseudogenes of rps14 are retained in the mitochondrial genomes of both rice and wheat. To determine how ancient this transfer is, the extent to which mitochondrial rps14 has been retained and is expressed in grasses, and whether other transfers of rps14 have occurred in grasses and their relatives, we investigated the structure, expression, and phylogeny of mitochondrial and nuclear rps14 genes from 32 additional genera of grasses and from 9 other members of the Poales."
"16842621","abstracttext_results","Filter hybridization experiments showed that rps14 sequences are present in the mitochondrial genomes of all examined Poales except for members of the grass subfamily Panicoideae (to which maize belongs). However, PCR amplification and sequencing revealed that the mitochondrial rps14 genes of all examined grasses (Poaceae), Cyperaceae, and Joinvilleaceae are pseudogenes, with all those from the Poaceae sharing two 4-NT frameshift deletions and all those from the Cyperaceae sharing a 5-NT insertion (only one member of the Joinvilleaceae was examined). cDNA analysis showed that all mitochondrial pseudogenes examined (from all three families) are transcribed, that most are RNA edited, and that surprisingly many of the edits are reverse (U-->C) edits. Putatively nuclear copies of rps14 were isolated from one to several members of each of these three Poales families. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the nuclear genes are probably the products of three independent transfers."
"16842621","abstracttext_conclusion","The rps14 gene has, most likely, been functionally transferred from the mitochondrion to the nucleus at least three times during the evolution of the Poales. The transfers in Cyperaceae and Poaceae are relatively ancient, occurring in the common ancestor of each family, roughly 80 million years ago, whereas the putative Joinvilleaceae transfer may be the most recent case of functional organelle-to-nucleus transfer yet described in any organism. Remarkably, nearly intact and expressed pseudogenes of rps14 have persisted in the mitochondrial genomes of most lineages of Poaceae and Cyperaceae despite the antiquity of the transfers and of the frameshift and RNA editing mutations that mark the mitochondrial genes as pseudogenes. Such long-term, nearly pervasive survival of expressed, apparent pseudogenes is to our knowledge unparalleled in any genome. Such survival probably reflects a combination of factors, including the short length of rps14, its location immediately downstream of rpl5 in most plants, and low rates of nucleotide substitutions and indels in plant mitochondrial DNAs. Their survival also raises the possibility that these rps14 sequences may not actually be pseudogenes despite their appearance as such. Overall, these findings indicate that intracellular gene transfer may occur even more frequently in angiosperms than already recognized and that pseudogenes in plant mitochondrial genomes can be surprisingly resistant to forces that lead to gene loss and inactivation."
"20170511","articletitle","Feasibility of physical map construction from fingerprinted bacterial artificial chromosome libraries of polyploid plant species."
"20170511","abstracttext_background","The presence of closely related genomes in polyploid species makes the assembly of total genomic sequence from shotgun sequence reads produced by the current sequencing platforms exceedingly difficult, if not impossible. Genomes of polyploid species could be sequenced following the ordered-clone sequencing approach employing contigs of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones and BAC-based physical maps. Although BAC contigs can currently be constructed for virtually any diploid organism with the SNaPshot high-information-content-fingerprinting (HICF) technology, it is currently unknown if this is also true for polyploid species. It is possible that BAC clones from orthologous regions of homoeologous chromosomes would share numerous restriction fragments and be therefore included into common contigs. Because of this and other concerns, physical mapping utilizing the SNaPshot HICF of BAC libraries of polyploid species has not been pursued and the possibility of doing so has not been assessed. The sole exception has been in common wheat, an allohexaploid in which it is possible to construct single-chromosome or single-chromosome-arm BAC libraries from DNA of flow-sorted chromosomes and bypass the obstacles created by polyploidy."
"20170511","abstracttext_results","The potential of the SNaPshot HICF technology for physical mapping of polyploid plants utilizing global BAC libraries was evaluated by assembling contigs of fingerprinted clones in an in silico merged BAC library composed of single-chromosome libraries of two wheat homoeologous chromosome arms, 3AS and 3DS, and complete chromosome 3B. Because the chromosome arm origin of each clone was known, it was possible to estimate the fidelity of contig assembly. On average 97.78% or more clones, depending on the library, were from a single chromosome arm. A large portion of the remaining clones was shown to be library contamination from other chromosomes, a feature that is unavoidable during the construction of single-chromosome BAC libraries."
"20170511","abstracttext_conclusions","The negligibly low level of incorporation of clones from homoeologous chromosome arms into a contig during contig assembly suggested that it is feasible to construct contigs and physical maps using global BAC libraries of wheat and almost certainly also of other plant polyploid species with genome sizes comparable to that of wheat. Because of the high purity of the resulting assembled contigs, they can be directly used for genome sequencing. It is currently unknown but possible that equally good BAC contigs can be also constructed for polyploid species containing smaller, more gene-rich genomes."

"29470622","abstracttext_key message","Coincident regions on chromosome 4B for GW, on 5A for SD and TSS, and on 3A for SL and GNS were detected through an integration of a linkage analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, six stable QTL clusters on chromosomes 2D, 3A, 4B, 5A and 6A were identified with high PVE% on a composite map. The panicle traits of wheat, such as grain number per spike and 1000-grain weight, are closely correlated with grain yield. Superior and effective alleles at loci related to panicles developments play a crucial role in the progress of molecular improvement in wheat yield breeding. Here, we revealed several notable allelic variations of seven panicle-related traits through an integration of genome-wide association mapping and a linkage analysis. The linkage analysis was performed using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (173 lines of F 8:9 ) with a high-density genetic map constructed with 90K SNP arrays, Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers in five environments. Thirty-five additive quantitative trait loci (QTL) were discovered, including eleven stable QTLs on chromosomes 1A, 2D, 4B, 5B, 6B, and 6D. The marker interval between EX_C101685 and RAC875_C27536 on chromosome 4B exhibited pleiotropic effects for GW, SL, GNS, FSN, SSN, and TSS, with the phenotypic variation explained (PVE) ranging from 5.40 to 37.70%. In addition, an association analysis was conducted using a diverse panel of 205 elite wheat lines with a composite map (24,355 SNPs) based on the Illumina Infinium assay in four environments. A total of 73 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) were detected for panicle traits, which were distributed across all wheat chromosomes except for 4D, 5D, and 6D. Consensus regions between RAC875_C27536_611 and Tdurum_contig4974_355 on chromosome 4B for GW in multiple environments, between QTSS5A.7-43 and BS00021805_51 on 5A for SD and TSS, and between QSD3A.2-164 and RAC875_c17479_359 on 3A for SL and GNS in multiple environments were detected through linkage analysis and a genome-wide association study (GWAS). In addition, six stable QTL clusters on chromosomes 2D, 3A, 4B, 5A, and 6A were identified with high PVE% on a composite map. This study provides potentially valuable information on the dissection of yield-component traits and valuable genetic alleles for molecular-design breeding or functional gene exploration."
"30732016","articletitle","First Report of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Races with Virulence to Wheat Stem Rust Resistance Genes Sr31 and Sr24 in Eritrea."
"30732016","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, has historically been a major limiting factor in wheat production. Identification of isolate Ug99 in Uganda in 1999 highlighted the vulnerability of a large proportion of the global wheat crop and raised international concerns. Since initial detection, seven races have been identified in the Ug99 lineage and occurrence has been confirmed in nine countries (4). During rust surveys of Eritrea undertaken in October 2010, stem rust was found to be widespread throughout the highland wheat-growing areas. Presence of P. graminis f. sp. tritici was recorded in 95% of the 92 cereal fields surveyed, with high disease severity (>40%) recorded at 50 sites. Collected stem rust samples were analyzed for race identity in a level 3 biocontainment laboratory in Canada. Nine collections yielded viable spores for infection studies. Virulence analysis with 20 differentials in the letter-code nomenclature system (1) identified two races from repeated experiments; TTKST (four confirmed isolates) and PTKST (five confirmed isolates). Both races belong to the Ug99 lineage and both exhibit combined Sr31 and Sr24 virulence. TTKST and PTKST differ only in their virulence or avirulence to Sr21, respectively. This first confirmation of TTKST and PTKST in Eritrea is important because it represents further geographical spread of Ug99-related races. Since first detection of a Sr24 variant of Ug99 (race TTKST) in Kenya in 2006 (1), these variants have become the predominant P. graminis f. sp. tritici pathotypes in most of eastern Africa. Race TTKST caused epidemics in Kenya in 2007, and race PTKST was first detected in Ethiopia the same year (T. Fetch, unpublished data). Recent detection of race PTKST in three additional southern Africa countries (South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique [2,3]) indicates on-going range expansion within the African continent. Sr24-virulent variants of Ug99 are a cause for concern since a high frequency of cultivars from South America, Australia, the United States, and the CIMMYT are known to possess the Sr24 resistance gene. On the basis of observed occurrence and postulated migration routes of the original Ug99 (race TTKSK), the confirmed presence of TTKST and PTKST in Eritrea increases the possibility for range expansion out of Africa by crossing the Red Sea and into the Arabian Peninsula. Future spread of TTKST and PTKST to western Asia is considered highly likely. References: (1) Y. Jin et al. Plant Dis. 92:923, 2008. (2) F. Mukoyi et al. Plant Dis. 95:1188, 2011. (3) Z. A.

"30686156","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most important diseases on wheat in the United States. In 2011, severe wheat stripe rust caused extensive application of fungicides in the western United States, and the disease was more widespread and caused more yield loss in the eastern United States in 2012. In this study, we characterized virulences and identified races of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici by testing the stripe rust samples collected throughout the United States in 2011 and 2012 on a set of 18 Yr single-gene differentials. In 2011, 35 races were identified from 349 viable samples collected from 19 states of the United States and Ontario province of Canada, with PSTv-11 (35.5%), PSTv-37 (12.6%), PSTv-14 (11.8%), PSTv-4 (5.4%), and PSTv-34 (3.4%) as the top five predominant races. In 2012, 23 races were identified from 341 viable samples collected from 24 states of the United States and Ontario of Canada, with PSTv-37 (47.5%), PSTv-11 (11.7%), PSTv-14 (10.0%), PSTv-52 (9.4%), and PSTv-48 (4.4%) as the top five predominant races. Nationally, PSTv-37, PSTv-52, and PSTv-34 were most widely distributed, while PSTv-11, PSTv-14, PSTv-4, and PSTv-48 were mostly detected in the western United States. High frequencies (>80%) were detected for virulences to Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr17, Yr27, Yr44, and YrExp2; moderate frequencies (20 to 80%) for virulences to Yr1, Yr43, YrTr1, and YrTye; low frequencies (<10%) for virulences to Yr10, Yr24, Yr32, and YrSP; and virulences to Yr5 and Yr15 were not detected, indicating that these two genes are still effective against the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici population in the United States. Both positive and negative associations were identified between some of the virulences. In total, 55 races identified from 2010 to 2012 in the United States were clustered into two major virulence groups, and dynamics of predominant races and virulence frequencies for the 3 years were presented and discussed. This information is useful for making decisions when screening wheat germplasm for developing stripe-rust-resistant wheat cultivars and managing the disease by growing cultivars with adequate and durable resistance. The severe epidemics and the occurrence of the large number of races in the 3 years indicate that efforts should be made to use diverse resistance genes, especially to combine effective all-stage resistance genes with genes for high-temperature adult-plant resistance."
"1123409","articletitle","Steroid hormone regulation of specific messenger RNA and protein synthesis in eucaryotic cells."
"1123409","abstracttext","Evidence is presented that the induction of specific proteins in the chick oviduct by the steroid hormones estrogen and progesterone, involves a primary effect at the level of gene transcription. The intracellular levels of mRNA's which code for the synthesis of the egg-white proteins, ovalbumin and avidin, have been quantitated in a heterologous protein synthesizing system. It is demonstrated that these levels are directly dependent upon the inducing steroid, estrogen or progesterone, respectively. Ovalbumin mRNA has been purified to apparent homogeneity. This ovalbumin mRNA was then used as a template for the synthesis of a complementary DNA copy catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase which was isolated from avian myeloblastosis virus. This radioactively labeled complementary DNA was used to demonstrate, by means of DNA excess hybridization, that the ovalbumin gene is represented only once in each haploid genome of the chick cell. Next the complementary DNA copy of the ovalbumin mRNA was used as a genetic probe to determine the precise number of sequences of ovalbumin mRNA present at any one time after the administration of estrogen. It was demonstrated that the unstimulated chick contained no sequences of ovalbumin mRNA. Within a very short period of time after estrogen is administered the ovalbumin sequences begin to appear and reach a steady state level of 140,000 molecules per tubular gland cell. It could also be calculated that each ovalbumin molecule is probably translated some 50,000 times during its life which explains why ovalbumin comprises some 60% of the total protein in the oviduct cell. Following withdrawal of the oviduct from estrogen treatment, ovalbumin mRNA sequences again drop to undetectable levels. However, following a single injection of estrogen to these withdrawn animals, new ovalbumin mRNA sequences could be detected within 30 minutes. These data suggest that estrogen controls the activity of the ovalbumin gene via a pure transcriptional control mechanism. It is also demonstrated that the efficiency of the complementary DNA as a means of quantitating specific mRNA sequences is some 1,000 times more sensitive than the best available in vitro translation system. Finally, the efficacy of four popular translation systems is compared. It is suggested that for initial studies involving hormonal control of mRNA levels, the translation system derived from wheat germ is the simplest and most sensitive."
"6194421","articletitle","Messenger RNA for glutamine synthetase. Review article."
"6194421","abstracttext","Of the various eucaryotic tissues, where glutamine synthetase (GS) mRNA and its regulation have been investigated, the induction of GS by glucocorticoids in the embryonic chick retina represents one of the systems most extensively studied. GS mRNA was first identified at the polysomal level by immunochemical precipitation of fractionated polysomes containing nascent GS chains with anti-GS gamma-globulin. The mRNA has been shown to be polyadenylated at the 3' end; on this basis, it has been partially purified from embryonic chick retina as well as from N. Crassa by chromatography on oligo(dT)-cellulose or poly(U)-sepharose and translated in cell-free protein synthesizing systems derived from wheat germ. Hormonal regulation of GS activity studied in the embryonic retina, hepatoma tissue culture cells, or in other tissues is always shown to be mediated by GS mRNA. In the retina, hydrocortisone (HC) elicits an age-related and transcription-dependent induction of GS by enhancing the level of GS mRNA in the polysomes through an increased supply of this mRNA from the nucleus. Comparative studies of three inhibitors of transcription, viz. actinomycin D, leucanthone and proflavine on the induction of GS by HC indicate that the latter inhibits GS mRNA selectively and reversibly with minimal effects on other RNA synthesis. Since proflavine acts by competing with HC-receptor binding sites in the nuclei, further studies on its interaction with the retina genome are likely to help identify the DNA sequences involved in the GS induction. In bacteria, studies on the genetics and physiology of various mutants with lesions in the structural gene for GS show that the transcription of the GS gene (gln A) is regulated both positively and negatively by GS and the product of another gene gln F. Purification of GS mRNA to homogeneity cloning of its cDNA and development of assay systems for cell-free transcription of GS are other studies likely to advance our knowledge on GS mRNA and its regulation."

"1450384","abstracttext","The time course of the accumulation of the transcripts from 13 psb genes encoding a major part of the proteins composing photosystem II during light-induced greening of dark-grown wheat seedlings was examined focusing on early stages of plastid development (0.5 h through 72 h). The 13 genes can be divided into three groups. (1) The psbA gene is transcribed as a single transcript of 1.3 kb in the dark-grown seedlings, but its level increases 5- to 7-fold in response to light due to selective increase in RNA stability as well as in transcription activity. (2) The psbE-F-L-J operon, psbM and psbN genes are transcribed as a single transcript of 1.1 kb, two transcripts of 0.5 and 0.7 kb and a single transcript of 0.3 kb, respectively, in the dark-grown seedlings. The levels of accumulation of every transcript remain unchanged or rather decrease during plastid development under illumination. (3) The psbK-I-D-C gene cluster and psbB-H operon exhibit fairly complicated northern hybridization patterns during the greening process. When a psbC or psbD gene probe was used for northern hybridization, five transcripts differing in length were detected in the etioplasts from 5-day old dark-grown seedlings. After 2 h illumination, two new transcripts of different length appeared. Light induction of new transcripts was also observed in the psbB-H operon."

"1587609","abstracttext","The pathogenic LEE strain of Naegleria fowleri isolated from human or mouse brain loses pathogenicity when cultured axenically in a nutrient broth. To identify genes differentially expressed in highly virulent versus weakly virulent amoebae, a cDNA library was constructed by using mRNA from amoebae recovered from a mouse brain. Two cDNA clones were isolated by differential screening of the library. The transcript homologous to clone Nf314 was preferentially expressed in highly virulent cells, whereas the transcript homologous to clone Nf435 was preferentially expressed in weakly virulent cells. Other clones showed negligible differential hybridization, but actin transcript levels were slightly elevated in the highly virulent cells. The Nf314 cDNA has an open reading frame for a 53-kDa protein 94% similar and 19% identical over 194 amino acid residues to serine carboxypeptidase from yeast cells, barley, and wheat. Southern blot analysis is consistent with a single copy of the Nf314 gene in the genome. Interestingly, the increased Nf314 transcript levels were present in cells fed on mouse brain, liver, or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts but not in cells fed on bacteria or in axenic culture. Thus, the inducer of the increased gene expression correlates with use of mammalian cells as a food source without regard to level of virulence. Since amoebae fed in culture on dissociated mouse brain were weakly virulent, as measured by their abilities to kill mice, the Nf314 gene may be required but is not sufficient for increased virulence."
"2928311","articletitle","Rat tissues express serum amyloid A protein-related mRNAs."
"2928311","abstracttext","Serum amyloid A (SAA) is a small (12 kDa) acute-phase apoprotein of high density lipoprotein found in mammals. It is also the precursor to amyloid protein A, the main protein constituent of fibrils found in amyloidosis secondary to chronic or recurrent inflammation--e.g., rheumatoid arthritis. However, rats do not develop amyloidosis and SAA is not an apoprotein of rat high density lipoprotein; thus rats appear to be an exception in regard to expression of SAA genes. We report here that rats do have representatives of the SAA gene family and express two distinct SAA mRNAs. Moreover, the pattern of genes expressed among tissues, and their induction by inflammatory agents, is similar to that of related mouse genes. RNA from various tissues of normal and injured rats was examined by RNA blot hybridization with SAA cDNA and complementary RNA probes for the three murine SAA genes. A SAA mRNA of approximately 400 nucleotides related to mouse SAA1 and SAA2 mRNAs reached a high level in liver 24 hr after injection of bacterial lipopolysaccharide. No extra-hepatic tissues were found to express the SAA1/SAA2-related mRNA. Turpentine induced two hepatic SAA1/SAA2-related mRNAs of approximately 400 and approximately 500 nucleotides in length. Liver SAA1/SAA2-related mRNA hybrid selected and translated in a wheat germ protein-synthesizing system, from lipopolysaccharide- and turpentine-injected rats, produced a single protein with an estimated molecular mass of 8 kDa. This rat liver SAA-related mRNA appears to lack a highly conserved coding region for portions of two amphipathic helical domains and the joining sequence. An mRNA related to mouse SAA3 was found expressed at a high level in lung after lipopolysaccharide but not following turpentine injection. This mRNA was also expressed at high levels in ileum and large intestine of control rats and was not found in the liver of control or challenged rats. These observations show that the SAA gene family is present and expressed in rats and that its expression is found under situations similar to those found in mice. This lends support for the importance of the SAA gene family in the response to injury by vertebrates."

"2894848","abstracttext","The molecular mechanisms of induction of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) by insulin were studied in the well-differentiated rat hepatoma cell line Fao. Incubation of Fao cells with insulin resulted in a 2-fold increase in TAT activity and TAT mRNA measured by Northern blot analysis with an oligonucleotide probe to the 5' end of the gene. The effect of insulin on TAT activity had a lag period of 30-60 min and was maximal within 4-5 h. The insulin effect on TAT mRNA was rapid, half-maximal after 15 min, and complete within 1-2 h. Insulin dose-response curves for stimulation of TAT activity and TAT mRNA were almost identical. TAT mRNA levels and enzyme activity were also stimulated by anti-insulin receptor antibodies and dexamethasone but not by wheat germ agglutinin, concanavalin A, or phytohemagglutin. The effect of insulin on the TAT gene was further investigated by measuring the relative rate of transcription in isolated nuclei using genomic TAT clones. Insulin produced a 1.5-1.7-fold increase in the production of TAT RNA transcripts. Dexamethasone induced both TAT activity and TAT mRNA to a comparable extent. In the presence of dexamethasone, insulin produced an additional 2-fold stimulation of TAT activity but had no additional effect on the abundance of TAT mRNA. These data provide direct evidence that insulin can increase TAT activity by at least two distinct mechanisms: insulin alone appears to increase TAT activity and TAT mRNA due to a stimulation of the TAT gene transcription rate; while in the presence of glucocorticoids, insulin increases TAT activity but not TAT mRNA, suggesting an insulin effect at the posttranscriptional level."

"6986991","abstracttext","The M species (medium sized) dsRNA (1.1-1.4 x 10(6) daltons) isolated from a toxin-producing yeast killer strain (K+R+) and three related, defective interfering (suppressive) S species dsRNAs of the yeast killer-associated cytoplasmic multicomponent viral-like particle system were analyzed by in vitro translation in a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesis system. Heat-denatured M species dsRNA programmed the synthesis of two major polypeptides, M-P1 (32,000 daltons) and M-P2 (30,000 daltons). M-P1 has been shown by the criteria of proteolytic peptide mapping and cross-antigenicity to contain ihe 12,000 dalton polypeptide corresponding to the in vivo produced killer toxin, thus establishing thiat it is the M species dsRNA which carries the toxin gene. An M species dsRNA obtained from a neutral strain (K-R+) also programmed the in vitro synthesis of a polypeptide identical in molecular weight to M-P1, thus indicating that the cytoplasmic determinant of the mutant neutral phenotype is either a simple point mutation in the dsRNA toxin gene or a mutation in a dsRNA gene which is required for functional toxin production. In vitro translation of each of the three different suppressive S dsRNAs resulted in the production of a polypeptide (S-P1) of approximately 8000 daltons instead of the 32,000 dalton M-P1 polypeptide programmed by M dsRNA. This result is consistent with the heteroduplex analysis of these dsRNAs by Fried and Fink (1978), which shows retention of M dsRNA ends, accompanied by large internal deletions in each of the S dsRNAs translated."

"2906307","abstracttext","We have examined the structure of nuclear genes coding for ribosomal RNAs in maize and its wild relatives, the teosintes and Tripsacum. Digestion of the rDNA (genes coding for 18S, 5.8S and 26S RNAs) with 15 restriction endonucleases (with six base pair recognition sites) yields essentially a single map for the approximately 10,000 repeat units within an individual plant or species. Both length and site variation were detected among species and were concentrated in the intergenic spacer region of the rDNA repeat unit. This result is in agreement with patterns of rDNA change observed among wheat and its relatives (Triticeae), and among vertebrate species. Digestion of these nuclear DNAs with BamHI and subsequent hybridization with a 5S RNA gene-specific probe allowed determination of the size of the 5S gene repeat unit in maize, teosintes, and Tripsacum. Groupings in the genus Zea were characterized by distinct repeat unit types five Tripsacum species examined shared a 260 base pair major repeat unit type. Additionally, several other restriction endonuclease cleavage patterns differentiated among the 5S DNAs within the genus Zea. The rDNA and 5S DNA restriction site variation among the species can be interpreted phylogenetically and agrees with biochemical, karyotypic, and morphological evidence that places maize closest to the Mexican teosintes. For both gene arrays, contributions from each parental genome can be detected by restriction enzyme analysis of progeny from crosses between maize and two distantly related teosintes, Zea luxurians or Zea diploperennis, but certain teosinte arrays were underrepresented in some of the hybrids."

"6302311","abstracttext","Biochemical mapping experiments of the simian rotavirus SA11 genome were performed to determine which double-stranded RNA segment coded for each of the viral polypeptides. Viral RNA transcripts were synthesized in vitro by using the endogenous viral RNA polymerase and fractionated by electrophoresis in acid-urea agarose gels. The fractionated transcripts were translated in two cell-free systems: micrococcal nuclease-treated reticulocyte lysates and wheat germ extracts. The polypeptide products were identified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and partial peptide analysis and compared with polypeptides synthesized in infected cells or found in purified virus. The RNA segment that coded for each transcript was determined by hybridization of the fractionated transcripts to the double-stranded RNA genome and analysis of the hybrids by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gels. Primary gene products were assigned for 10 of the rotavirus transcripts and 10 of the double-stranded RNA segments. The coding assignments are as follows: the inner-capsid polypeptides, VP1, VP2, and VP6, were assigned to segments 1, 2, and 6, respectively; the major outer-capsid polypeptides, VP3 and VP7, were assigned to segments 4 and 9, respectively; segments 5, 7, and 8 coded for nonstructural polypeptides with molecular weights of 53,000, 34,000, and 35,000, respectively; segment 10 coded for the 20,000-molecular-weight precursor to the 29,000-molecular-weight glycosylated nonstructural polypeptide; and segment 11 coded for a 26,000-molecular-weight polypeptide that may be the precursor to the minor outer-capsid polypeptide VP9. Several methods were used to determine the product of gene segment 3, and the problems associated with the identification of this gene product are discussed."
"8155884","articletitle","Homologues of wheat ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes--TaUBC1 and TaUBC4 are encoded by small multigene families in Arabidopsis thaliana."
"8155884","abstracttext","Covalent attachment of ubiquitin to other cellular proteins has been implicated in a multitude of diverse physiological processes in eukaryotes including selective protein degradation. This attachment is carried out by a multi-enzyme pathway consisting of three classes of enzymes: ubiquitin-activating enzymes (E1s), ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s), and ubiquitin-protein ligases (E3s). E2s accept activated ubiquitin from E1 and conjugate it to target proteins with or without the participation of specific E3s. Previously, we have isolated wheat cDNAs encoding 16 and 23 kDa E2s, TaUBC1 and TaUBC4, respectively. TaUBC1 shows structural homology to the yeast RAD6 E2 that is essential for DNA repair whereas TaUBC4 is related to the yeast ScUBC8 E2, both of which effectively conjugate ubiquitin to histones in vitro but as yet are without a known in vivo function. Here, we report the isolation of genomic and cDNA homologues of these genes from Arabidopsis thaliana. In Arabidopsis, both of these E2s are encoded by three member gene families. Members of the AtUBC1 gene family, comprising AtUBC1, 2 and 3, encode 150-152 amino acid proteins that are 83-99% identical to each other and TaUBC1 and contain four introns that are conserved with respect to position. Members of the AtUBC4 gene family, comprising AtUBC4, 5 and 6, encode 187-191 amino acid proteins that are 73-88% identical to each other and TaUBC4 and contain five introns that are conserved with respect to position.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"7948863","articletitle","Characterization and differential expression of dhn/lea/rab-like genes during cold acclimation and drought stress in Arabidopsis thaliana."
"7948863","abstracttext","We have characterized cDNAs for two new dhn/lea/rab (dehydrin, late embryogenesis-abundant, responsive to ABA)-related genes from Arabidopsis thaliana. The two genes were strongly induced in plants exposed to low temperature (4 degrees C) and were accordingly designated lti45 and lti30 (low temperature-induced). The lti45 gene product contains the conserved serine stretch and three lysine-rich repeats characteristic of DHN/LEA/RAB proteins and is very similar to another low temperature-responsive protein of A. thaliana, COR47 [17]. Both proteins have the same repeat structure and an overall amino acid identity of 64%. This structural similarity of the proteins and the tandem array of the genes suggest that this gene pair arose through a duplication. The other polypeptide, LTI30, consists of several lysine-rich repeats, a structure found in CAP85, a low temperature- and water stress-responsive protein in spinach [41] and similar proteins found in wheat [20]. The expression pattern of the five dhn/lea/rab-related genes (cor47, dhnX, lti30, lti45 and rab18) identified so far in A. thaliana, was characterized in plants exposed to low temperature, drought and abscisic acid (ABA). Expression of both lti30 and lti45 was mainly responsive to low temperature similar to cor47. The lti45 and lti30 genes show only a weak response to ABA in contrast to cor47, which is moderately induced by this hormone. The three genes were also induced in severely water-stressed plants although the expression of lti30 and lti45 was rather low. In contrast to these mainly low temperature-induced genes, the expression of rab18 was strongly induced both in water-stressed and ABA-treated plants but was only slightly responsive to cold. The dhnX gene showed a very different expression pattern. It was not induced with any of the treatments tested but exhibited a significant constitutive expression. The low-temperature induction of the genes in the first group, lti30 and lti45, is ABA-independent, deduced from experiments with the ABA-deficient (aba-1) and ABA-insensitive (abil) mutants of A. thaliana, whereas the induction of rab18 is ABA-mediated. The expression of dhnX was not significantly affected in the ABA mutants."
"7948917","articletitle","Structure and promoter analysis of an ABA- and stress-regulated barley gene, HVA1."
"7948917","abstracttext","A single-copy barley gene, HVA1, encoding a class 3 late embryogenesis-abundant protein, can be induced by either treatment with abscisic acid (ABA) or by stress conditions such as drought, cold, heat and salinity. We have isolated an HVA1 genomic clone containing about 400 bp of 5'-upstream sequence, a single 109 bp intron, and the full coding sequence. Linker scan mutagenesis and transient expression studies were used to test the function of four HVA1 promoter elements conserved in ABA-responsive genes. Mutations in two of these elements, the C box and the putative ABRE 1 (ABA-responsive element) containing an ACGT core, resulted in no significant change in transcription level or ABA induction. In contrast, mutations of the other two elements, putative ABRE 2 & 3 cause the level of transcription to drop to 10-20% of that obtained with the wild-type promoter indicating that the high level of expression of HVA1 is dependent on both pABRE 2 & 3. Interestingly, despite their low level of expression, the mutated promoters still gave more than 20-fold induction in response to ABA treatment. We suggest that the ABA induction of barley HVA1 gene is governed by a complex consisting of pABRE 2 & 3 working together to regulate the absolute level of expression, and either of these elements or a possible third element may regulate ABA inducibility. Phylogenetic analysis by parsimony indicates that the barley HVA1 and wheat pMA2005 sequences share a recent common ancester. These two genes are closely related to the carrot Dc3 and cotton D-7 genes with which they share a similar structural gene organization."

"7948927","abstracttext","The heterotetrameric enzyme hydroxynitrile lyase (HNL) from sorghum (EC 4.1.2.11) is involved in the catabolism of the cyanogenic glycoside dhurrin. We have isolated a cDNA clone comprising about 90% of the COOH terminal sequence of a precursor which encodes both subunit of HNL from Sorghum bicolor L. (SbHNL). Hence the subunits of SbHNL must be the result of post-translational processing. The deduced amino acid sequence of HNL shares significant sequence homology with members of the serine carboxypeptidase family. In particular, HNL from sorghum shares the catalytical triad Asp. His, and Ser with these enzymes which evolved in 3 groups of enzymes (carboxypeptidase, chymotrypsin, and subtilisin) by convergent evolution. Moreover, like serine carboxypeptidases, HNL from sorghum consists of two pairs of glycosylated cysteine linked A and B chains forming a heterotetramer of a molecular weight of 105,000 (carboxypeptidases 120,000). Thus, HNL from sorghum closely resembles to serine carboxypeptidases but differs from all other HNLs described so far. Western blotting experiments revealed cross reaction between carboxypeptidase from wheat and anti SbHNL antisera. Therefore, convergent evolution of HNLs from various ancestoral enzymes is conceivable. Hybridization of SbHNL cDNA to northern blots of total RNAs isolated from various organs of young sorghum seedlings shows the same expression pattern of HNL as found by means of western blotting or enzyme assays. Using PCR and Southern blot analysis, we demonstrated that the gene of SbHNL is free of introns. Further sequence analysis of cDNA clones and genomic DNA revealed a stretch of 23 adenine residues in the 3'-untranslated part of the gene. Both, intronless organisation of the gene and a genomic stretch of oligo A suggests that SbHNL may have evolved by a reverse transcription event."

"8220444","abstracttext","To investigate developmental regulation of wheat histone H3 gene expression, the H3 promoter, which has its upstream sequence to -1711 (relative to the cap site as +1), was fused to the coding region of the gus A gene (-1711H3/GUS) and introduced into a monocot plant, rice. Detailed histochemical analysis revealed two distinct types of GUS expression in transgenic rice plants; one is cell division-dependent found in the apical meristem of shoots and roots and in young leaves, and another is cell division-independent detected in flower tissues including the anther wall and the pistil. In this study, replication-dependent expression occurring in non-dividing cells which undergo endoreduplication could not be discriminated from strict replication-independent expression. The observed expression pattern in different parts of roots suggested that the level of the H3/GUS gene expression is well correlated with activity of cell division in roots. To identify 5' sequences of the H3 promoter necessary for an accurate regulation of the GUS expression, two constructs containing truncated promoters, -908H3/GUS and -185H3/GUS, were analyzed in transiently expressed protoplasts, stably transformed calli and transgenic plants. The results indicated that the region from -909 to -1711 contains the positive cis-acting element(s) and that the proximal promoter region (up to -185) containing the conserved hexamer, octamer and nonamer motifs is sufficient to direct both cell division-dependent and -independent expression. The use of the meristem of roots regenerated from transformed calli for the analysis of cell division-dependent expression of plant genes is discussed."
"8876666","articletitle","Overexpression of bovine growth hormone in transgenic mice is associated with changes in hepatic insulin receptors and in their kinase activity."
"8876666","abstracttext","Transgenic mice expressing a hybrid gene produced by linking the promoter regulatory region of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) gene to the bovine growth hormone (bGH) gene, were used to investigate the effects of GH on insulin binding and insulin dependent tyrosine kinase activity of hepatic insulin receptors. Transgenic mice had normal levels of blood glucose, despite hyperinsulinemia, indicating that these animals were insulin resistant. The number of insulin receptors in the liver of transgenic mice was significantly decreased in both the particulate fraction (25%) and the solubilized membranes (40%) indicating that expressed (functional) and non-expressed (cryptic) receptors were affected. Scatchard analysis of competitive binding curves for insulin indicated that the affinity of the receptor did not differ between transgenic and normal mice. Insulin dependent tyrosine kinase activity in insulin receptors partially purified by wheat germ agglutin (WGA) agarose chromatography from solubilized liver membranes, was measured. The stimulatory action of insulin on phosphorylation of the synthetic substrate (a copolymer Glu-Tyr, 4:1) was increased 100% in transgenic, as compared to normal mice, using the same binding activity. Since transgenic mice are hyperinsulinemic, it is likely that the decreased insulin binding in this group reflects down regulation of the expressed and non-expressed insulin receptors, and the increased kinase activity represents a compensatory mechanism. We conclude that alterations in the insulin receptor number and in the tyrosine kinase activity develop in response to changes in insulin levels. Thus, insulin resistance detected in the liver of transgenic mice overexpressing GH may be due to post receptor defects."

"9049259","abstracttext","The S phase-specific expression of histone genes provides an interesting model for studying activation of gene transcription during the cell cycle. In plants, however, trans-acting factors responsible for histone gene transcription are poorly documented. Using combined gel shift, UV cross-linking and competition analysis, we carried out a systematic study to identify and characterize proteins binding with the previously established cis elements of the plant histone gene promoters. Nuclear extracts prepared from the highly synchronizable tobacco BY2 cells were used. We confirmed the presence of proteins binding to the hexamer (ACGTCA) motif which has been previously identified as the binding site of wheat HBP-1 proteins. Interestingly, multiple proteins were found to bind specifically with the nonamer (CAATCCAAC) element and their DNA-binding activity was abolished upon in vitro protein phosphatase treatment. This later result imply phosphorylation/dephosphorylation as a potential post-translational control for DNA-binding activity of nonamer-binding proteins. In addition, the DNA-binding activity of these nonamer-binding proteins was found to be positively correlated with the S phase-specific expression of the histone genes in the synchronized cells, suggesting their function in the activation of transcription during the G1/S transition. Finally, several proteins were observed to bind specifically with an A/T-rich hexamer (TAATAT) motif. Their DNA-binding activity, however, was insensitive to phosphatase activity in vitro and relatively constitutive during the cell cycle. This A/T-rich hexamer as a new cis-acting element of plant histone genes is discussed."

"8851797","abstracttext","The Bt-10 bunt gene confers resistance to most races of the common bunt fungi, Tilletia tritici and T. laevis. The RAPD technique, employing a total of 965 decamer primers, was used to identify polymorphic markers between resistant (BW553) and susceptible ('Neepawa"") near-isogenic lines. Primer 196 (5' CTC CTC CCC C 3') produced a 590 base pair (bp) reproducible fragment only in the resistant near-isogenic line. The 590-bp DNA fragment was present in all the 22 wheat cultivars known to carry the Bt-10 resistance gene and also in 15 resistant F2 lines obtained from a cross between the resistant parent, BW553, and the susceptible parent, 'Neepawa'. The 590-bp fragment was absent in 16 susceptible cultivars tested and in 15 susceptible F2 lines obtained from the cross described above. These results suggest a close linkage between the presence of the 590-bp fragment and the Bt-10 resistance gene. Primer 372 (5' CCC ACT GAC G 3') amplified a 1.0-kilobase (kb) fragment that was present only in the susceptible near-isogenic line. This 1.0-kb fragment was present in 13 of the 16 susceptible cultivars and in 13 of the 15 susceptible F2 lines. However, the primer also amplified the 1.0-kb fragment in some resistant cultivars and resistant F2 lines, suggesting a looser linkage between the occurrence of the fragment and the susceptible allele."

"10069078","abstracttext","A 745 bp sequence (pSau3A9) located at the centromeres of several cereal species was isolated from a sorghum BAC library by Jiang et al. (1996, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 93, 14210-14213). We have amplified a partially homologous 809 bp sequence from barely genomic DNA by PCR and localized it to the centromeres of barley, wheat and rye chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). Sequence analysis showed this barley homolog of pSau3A9 to have high similarity to the integrase region of the polyprotein gene of Ty3/gypsy group retrotransposons. Using this integrase sequence as a probe, several clones were isolated from a lambda library constructed of genomic barley DNA. One of the lambda clones contained coding regions for all five catalytic sites characteristic of the retrotransposon polyprotein. Two direct repeats flanking the polyprotein gene are homologous to the cereal centromeric sequence described by Aragón-Alcaide et al. (1996, Chromosoma, 105, 261-268) and may represent all or part of the long-terminal repeats (LTRs). Different plasmid subclones containing various regions of the lambda clone were used in FISH to show that the entire polyprotein gene and upstream flanking sequences, including the presumed LTR, are present at barley centromeres. The preferential (or exclusive) localization of an apparently complete retroelement within the centromeric regions of several cereal species raises interesting questions about its role in karyotype evolution and centromere function."
"9425686","articletitle","A two-component system plays an important role in the root-colonizing ability of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain WCS365."
"9425686","abstracttext","We describe the characterization of a novel Tn5lacZ colonization mutant of the efficiently colonizing Pseudomonas fluorescens strain WCS365, mutant strain PCL1210, which is at least 300- to 1,000-fold impaired in colonization of the potato root tip after co-inoculation of potato stem cuttings with a 1:1 mixture of mutant and parental cells. Similarly, the mutant is also impaired in colonization of tomato, wheat, and radish, indicating that the gene involved plays a role in the ability of P. fluorescens WCS365 to colonize a wide range of plant species. A 3.1-kb DNA fragment was found to be able to complement the observed mutation. The nucleotide sequence of the region around the Tn5lacZ insertion showed three open reading frames (ORFs). The transcriptional start site was determined. The operon is preceded by an integration host factor (IHF) binding site consensus sequence whereas no clear -10 and -35 sequences are present. The deduced amino acid sequences of the first two genes of the operon, designated as colR and colS, show strong similarity with known members of two-component regulatory systems. ColR has homology with the response regulators of the OmpR-PhoB subclass whereas ColS, the product of the gene in which the mutation resides, shows similarity to the sensor kinase members of these two-component systems. Hydrophobicity plots show that this hypothetical sensor kinase has two transmembrane domains, as is also known for other sensor kinases. The product of the third ORF, Orf222, shows no homology with known proteins. Only part of the orf222 gene is present in the colonization-complementing, 3.1-kb region, and it therefore does not play a role in complementation. No experimental evidence for a role of the ColR/ColS two-component system in the suspected colonization traits chemotaxis and transport of exudate compounds could be obtained. The function of this novel two-component system therefore remains to be elucidated. We conclude that colonization is an active process in which an environmental stimulus, through this two-component system, activates a so far unknown trait that is crucial for colonization."

"9645205","abstracttext","Barely yellow dwarf luteovirus-GPV (BYDV-GPV) is a common problem in Chinese wheat crops but is unrecorded elsewhere. A defining characteristic of GPV is its capacity to be transmitted efficiently by both Schizaphis graminum and Rhopaloshiphum padi. This dual aphid species transmission contrasts with those of BYDV-RPV and BYDV-SGV, globally distributed viruses, which are efficiently transmitted only by Rhopaloshiphum padi and Schizaphis graminum respectively. The viral RNA sequences encoding the coat protein (22K) gene, the movement protein (17K) gene, the region surrounding the conserved GDD motif of the polymerase gene and the intergenic sequences between these genes were determined for GPV and an Australian isolate of BYDV-RPV (RPVa). In all three genes, the sequences of GPV and RPVa were more similar to those of an American isolate of BYDV-RPV (RPVu) than to any other luteovirus for which there is data available. RPVa and RPVu were very similar, especially their coat proteins which had 97% identity at the amino acid level. The coat protein of GPV had 76% and 78% amino acid identity with RPVa and RPVu respectively. The data suggest that RPVu and RPVa are correctly named as strains of the same serotype and that GPV is sufficiently different from either RPV strain to be considered a distinct BYDV type. The coat protein and movement protein genes of GPV are very dissimilar to SGV. The polymerase sequences of RPVu, RPVa and GPV show close affinities with those of the sobemo-like luteoviruses and little similarity with those of the carmo-like luteoviruses. The sequences of the coat proteins, movement proteins and the polymerase segments of BYDV serotypes, other than RPV and GPV, form a cluster that is separate from their counterpart sequences from dicot-infecting luteoviruses. The RPV and GPV isolates consistently fall within a dicot-infecting cluster. This suggests that RPV and GPV evolved from within this group of viruses. Since these other viruses all infect dicots it seems likely that their common ancestor infected a dicot and that RPV and GPV evolved from a virus that switched hosts from a dicot to a monocot."

To identify model systems for investigating regulation of MUC5/5AC gene expression and secretion of MUC5/5AC mucins in airway epithelial cells, we evaluated the expression of several mucin genes in six carcinoma cell lines of respiratory tract origin. RNA was extracted from A549, Calu-3, NCI H292, Calu-6, RPMI 2650, and A-427 cells; MUC1, MUC2, MUC4, MUC5/5AC, and MUC5B messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was determined. By Northern analyses, all cell lines expressed MUC1 mRNA, whereas MUC2 mRNA was not detectable in any of the cell lines. RPMI 2650 cell lines expressed only MUC1 mRNA. NCI-H292 cells expressed MUC4 and low levels of MUC5/5AC mRNA. Calu-3 and A549 cells expressed MUC5/5AC mRNA; A549 cells also expressed MUC5B mRNA. Glycoconjugates secreted by lung carcinoma cells were also examined. By wheat germ lectin analysis, Calu-3, H292, and A549 cells secreted high molecular weight glycoproteins having N-acetylglucosamine and/or sialic acid moieties. Western blot analyses with an anti-MUC5:TR-3A antibody demonstrated that Calu-3 and A549 cells secreted MUC5/5AC mucins. All six carcinoma cell lines secreted large, radiolabeled, sulfated macromolecules; the majority were proteoglycans that were digested by hyaluronidase. However, Calu-3 cells also secreted sulfated high molecular-weight glycoproteins that were immunoprecipitated by anti-MUC5:TR-3A antibody. These studies demonstrated that Calu-3 and A549 cell lines expressed high and moderate amounts of MUC5/5AC mRNA and MUC5/5AC mucins, whereas H292 cells expressed lesser amounts. These cell lines should prove useful for studies of MUC5/5AC gene expression and MUC5/5AC biosynthesis, trafficking, and secretions in airway epithelial cells."

"11244096","abstracttext","Rice (Oryza sativa) is a model species for monocotyledonous plants, especially for members in the grass family. Several attributes such as small genome size, diploid nature, transformability, and establishment of genetic and molecular resources make it a tractable organism for plant biologists. With an estimated genome size of 430 Mb (Arumuganathan and Earle, 1991), it is feasible to obtain the complete genome sequence of rice using current technologies. An international effort has been established and is in the process of sequencing O. sativa spp. japonica var ""Nipponbare"" using a bacterial artificial chromosome/P1 artificial chromosome shotgun sequencing strategy. Annotation of the rice genome is performed using prediction-based and homology-based searches to identify genes. Annotation tools such as optimized gene prediction programs are being developed for rice to improve the quality of annotation. Resources are also being developed to leverage the rice genome sequence to partial genome projects such as expressed sequence tag projects, thereby maximizing the output from the rice genome project. To provide a low level of annotation for rice genomic sequences, we have aligned all rice bacterial artificial chromosome/P1 artificial chromosome sequences with The Institute of Genomic Research Gene Indices that are a set of nonredundant transcripts that are generated from nine public plant expressed sequence tag projects (rice, wheat, sorghum, maize, barley, Arabidopsis, tomato, potato, and barrel medic). In addition, we have used data from The Institute of Genomic Research Gene Indices and the Arabidopsis and Rice Genome Projects to identify putative orthologues and paralogues among these nine genomes."

Musketeer) grown in a combination of specific temperature (degrees C)/irradiance (micromol m(-2) s(-1)) regimes (20/50; 20/250; 20/800; 5/50; 5/250) revealed (1) that photosynthetic acclimation to low temperature mimics photosynthetic acclimation to high light because both conditions result in comparable reduction states of photosystem II (PSII), that is, comparable PSII excitation pressure; (2) that the relative redox state of PSII also appears to regulate a specific cold acclimation gene, Wcs19. In order to identify additional genes regulated differentially by either low temperature, irradiance or excitation pressure, we initiated a detailed analysis of gene expression. We identified and characterized 42 differentially expressed genes from wheat and rye. Based on their patterns of regulation under the five growth conditions employed, 37 of the cDNAs could be classified into four groups: genes regulated by PSII excitation pressure, low temperature, growth irradiance and interaction between growth temperature and irradiance. Partial sequence analyses revealed that several of these genes encode known chloroplastic proteins such as ELIPs, transketolase, carbonic anhydrase and Mg-chelatase. However, five of the genes could not be classified unambiguously into any one of these four categories. The implications of these results and the limitations of the experimental design are discussed in terms of larger-scale genomic studies designed to understand the interactions of multiple abiotic stresses to which a plant may be exposed when examining regulation of gene expression."

The MAT1-2 idiomorph is 2772 bp and contains a single gene encoding a putative high-mobility-group protein of 394 amino acids. The opposite idiomorph was obtained from isolate IPO323, which has the complementary mating type, by long-range PCR using primers derived from sequences flanking the MAT1-2 idiomorph. The MAT1-1 locus is 2839 bp in size and contains a single open reading frame encoding a putative alpha1-domain protein of 297 amino acids. Within the nonidiomorphic sequences, homology was found with palI, encoding a membrane receptor from Aspergillus nidulans, and a gene encoding a putative component of the anaphase-promoting complex from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and a DNA-(apurinic or apyrimidinic) lyase from S. pombe. For each of the MAT genes specific primers were designed and tested on an F1 mapping population that was generated from a cross between IPO323 and IPO94269. An absolute correlation was found between the amplified allele-specific fragments and the mating type as determined by backcrosses of each F1 progeny isolate to the parental isolates. The primers were also used to screen a collection of field isolates in a multiplex PCR. An equal distribution of MAT1-1 and MAT1-2 alleles was found for most geographic origins examined."

"15466878","abstracttext_scope","An increasing number of resistance (R) genes have been isolated from rice, maize, wheat and barley that encode both structurally related and unique proteins. This R protein diversity may be attributable to the different modus operandi employed by pathogen species in some cases, but it is also a consequence of multiple defence strategies being employed against phytopathogens. Mutational analysis of barley has identified additional genes required for activation of an R gene-mediated defence response upon pathogen infection. In some instances very closely related barley R proteins require different proteins for defence activation, demonstrating that, within a single plant species, multiple resistance signalling pathways and different resistance strategies have evolved to confer protection against a single pathogen species. Despite the apparent diversity of cereal resistance mechanisms, some of the additional molecules required for R protein function are conserved amongst cereal and dicotyledonous species and even other eukaryotic species. Thus the derivation of functional homologues and interacting partner proteins from other species is contributing to the understanding of resistance signalling in cereals. The potential and limit of utilizing the rice genome sequence for further R gene isolation from cereal species is also considered, as are the new biotechnological possibilities for disease control arising from R gene isolation."

"12000679","abstracttext","RNA silencing of endogenous plant genes can be achieved by virus-mediated, transient expression of homologous gene fragments. This powerful, reverse genetic approach, known as virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS), has been demonstrated only in dicot plant species, where it has become an important tool for functional genomics. Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) is a tripartite, positive-sense RNA virus that infects many agriculturally important monocot species including barley, oats, wheat and maize. To demonstrate VIGS in a monocot host, we modified BSMV to express untranslatable foreign inserts downstream of the gammab gene, in either sense or antisense orientations. Phytoene desaturase (PDS) is required for synthesizing carotenoids, compounds that protect chlorophyll from photo-bleaching. A partial PDS cDNA amplified from barley was 90, 88 and 74% identical to PDS cDNAs from rice, maize and Nicotiana benthamiana, respectively. Barley infected with BSMV expressing barley, rice or maize PDS fragments became photo-bleached and accumulated phytoene (the substrate for PDS) in a manner similar to plants treated with the chemical inhibitor of PDS, norflurazon. In contrast, barley infected with wild-type BSMV, or BSMV expressing either N. benthamiana PDS or antisense green fluorescent protein (GFP), did not photo-bleach or accumulate phytoene. Thus BSMV silencing of the endogenous PDS was homology-dependent. Deletion of the coat protein enhanced the ability of BSMV to silence PDS. This is the first demonstration of VIGS in a monocot, and suggests that BSMV can be used for functional genomics and studies of RNA-silencing mechanisms in monocot plant species."

"12582551","abstracttext","Barley is the most sensitive among the cereals to aluminium (Al) stress and breeding for more tolerant cultivars is a priority. To enhance selection efficiency for Al tolerance in barley, PCR-based AFLP and microsatellite markers linked to a locus conferring tolerance to aluminium were identified. The study used F(2) progeny derived from a single cross between Yambla (moderately tolerant of Al) and WB229 (tolerant of Al) and developed hydroponic pulse-recovery screening methods to assess tolerance of phenotypes based on root growth. The segregation ratios of tolerant and sensitive genotypes and F(3) progeny testing suggest that a single major gene controlled Al tolerance ( Alt). In order to determine the chromosomal location of the Alt gene, we used the AFLP technique coupled with bulk segregant analysis. We evaluated tolerant and sensitive bulks using 30 combinations of EcoRI/ MseI primers, and 12 of these permitted differentiation of the sensitive and tolerant bulks. More than 1,000 amplified fragments were obtained, and 98 polymorphic bands were scored. AFLP analysis of wheat-barley chromosome addition lines indicated that the Alt gene was located on barley chromosome 4H. Four chromosome 4H-specific microsatellite markers (Bmac310, Bmag353, HVM68 and HVMCABG) were tightly linked to Alt. The large allelic variation detected with microsatellite marker Bmag353 allowed us to implement this marker for routine marker-assisted selection for Al tolerance, and 396 plants could be screened on a single gel."

"12620255","abstracttext","Gibberella zeae is a broad host range pathogen that infects many crop plants, including wheat and barley, and causes head blight and rot diseases throughout the world. To better understand fungal development and pathogenicity, we have generated 7996 ESTs from three cDNA libraries. Two libraries were generated from carbon-(C-) and nitrogen- (N-) starved mycelia and one library was generated from cultures of maturing perithecia (P). In other fungal pathogens, starvation conditions have been shown to act as cues to induce infection-related gene expression. To assign putative function to cDNAs, sequences were initially assembled using StackPack. The estimated total number of genes identified from the three EST databases was 2110: 1088 contigs and 1022 singleton sequences. These 2110 sequences were compared to a yeast protein sequence reference set and to the GenBank nonredundant database using BLASTX. Based on presumptive gene function identified by this process, we found that the two starved cultures had similar, but not identical, patterns of gene expression, whereas the developmental cultures were distinct in their pattern of expression. Of the three libraries, the perithecium library had the greatest percentage (46%) of ESTS falling into the ""unclassified"" category. Homologues of some known fungal virulence or pathogenicity factors were found primarily in the N- and C-libraries. Comparisons also were made with ESTs from the related fungi, Neurospora crassa and Magnaporthe grisea and the genomic sequence of N. crassa."

"12943549","abstracttext","T-DNA recombination and replication was analyzed in 'black mexican sweet' (BMS) cells transformed with T-DNAs containing the replication system from wheat dwarf virus (WDV). Upon recombination between the T-DNA ends, a promoterless marker gene (gusA) was activated. Activation of the recombination marker gene was delayed and increased exponentially over time, suggesting that recombination and amplification of the T-DNA occurred in maize cells. Mutant versions of the viral initiator gene (rep), known to be defective in the replication function, failed to generate recoverable recombinant T-DNA molecules. Circularization of T-DNA by the FLP/FRT site-specific recombination system and/or homologous recombination was not necessary to recover circular T-DNAs. However, replicating T-DNAs appeared to be suitable substrates for site-specific and homologous recombination. Among 33 T-DNA border junctions sequenced, only one pair of identical junction sites was found implying that the population of circular T-DNAs was highly heterogenous. Since no circular T-DNA molecules were detected in treatments without rep, it suggested that T-DNA recombination was linked to replication and might have been stimulated by this process. The border junctions observed in recombinant T-DNA molecules were indicative of illegitimate recombination and were similar to left-border recombination of T-DNA into the genome after Agro-mediated plant transformation. However, recombination between T-DNA molecules differed from T-DNA/genomic DNA junction sites in that few intact right borders were observed. The replicating T-DNA molecules did not enhance genomic random integration of T-DNA in the experimental configuration used for this study."

For both proteins, MALDI-TOFMS analysis showed that the isolated fractions contained a second component with a mass about 500-540 Da lower than the major component. The testing and correction of the gene-derived amino acid sequences of both proteins were performed by direct MALDI-TOFMS analysis of their tryptic peptide mixture and analysis of the digests was performed by recording several MALDI mass spectra of the mixture at low, medium and high mass ranges, optimising the matrix and the acquisition parameters for each mass range. Complementary data were obtained by RP-HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of the tryptic digest. This resulted in the coverage of the whole protein sequences except for two short fragments (T1 and T8), which are identical in the two homologous subunits, and for an additional dipeptide (T14) in subunit 1Dy12, which were not detected. It also demonstrated that, in contrast to the gene-derived data, the sequence of subunit 1Dy12 does not include the dipeptide Gly-Gln between residues Gln(454) and Pro(455), and that the lower mass components present in both fractions correspond to the same sequences lacking short peptides that are probably lost from the protein N- or C-termini. Finally, the results obtained provide evidence for the lack of a substantial level of glycosylation or other post-translational modifications of the two subunits, and demonstrate that mass spectrometric mapping is the most useful method presently available for the direct verification of the gene-derived sequences of HMW glutenin subunits and similar proteins."

"14641577","abstracttext","The response regulator gene gacA influences the production of several secondary metabolites in both pathogenic and beneficial Pseudomonas spp. In this study, we developed primers and a probe for the gacA gene of Pseudomonas species and sequenced a 425 bp fragment of gacA from ten Pseudomonas strains isolated from different plant-associated environments. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and Southern hybridization showed that gacA is highly conserved within the genus Pseudomonas: multiple strains of different Pseudomonas species all responded positively to the probe, whereas no response was obtained from 18 other strains representing 14 species that belong to eight different genera of Gram-negative bacteria other than Pseudomonas. Furthermore, from a total of approximately 550 indigenous bacterial isolates obtained from the rhizosphere of wheat, all isolates that hybridized with the gacA probe were classified as Pseudomonas spp. by group-specific primers. Isolates that did not respond with the gacA probe and primers were identified as bacterial genera other than Pseudomonas, including Stenotrophomonas, Cryseomonas and Comamonas spp. These results indicate that gacA can be used as a complementary genetic marker for detection of Pseudomonas spp. in environmental samples. Phylogenetic relationships inferred from the newly sequenced gacA fragments and the sequences of gacA homologues present in the databases, showed six distinct clusters that correspond to the following bacterial families: Pseudomonaceae, Enterobacteriaceae, Alteromonadaceae, Vibrionaceae, Burkholderia and Xanthomonas. Within the Pseudomonadaceae and Enterobacteriaceae, polymorphisms within gacA and its homologues allowed identification of six and five subclusters respectively. Comparison of the gacA gene and GacA protein-based trees with the tree inferred from 16S rDNA sequences yielded a similar overall clustering. These results suggest that gacA and its homologues may provide complementary markers for phylogenetic studies of Pseudomonas spp. and Gram-negative bacteria other than Pseudomonas."

"18069943","abstracttext","The phytotoxic effects of aluminum (Al) on root systems of crop plants constitute a major agricultural problem in many areas of the world. Root exudation of Al-chelating molecules such as low-molecular-weight organic acids has been shown to be an important mechanism of plant Al tolerance/resistance. Differences observed in the physiology and electrophysiology of root function for two maize genotypes with contrasting Al tolerance revealed an association between rates of Al-activated root organic acid release and Al tolerance. Using these genotypes, we cloned ZmALMT1, a maize gene homologous to the wheat ALMT1 and Arabidopsis AtALMT1 genes that have recently been described as encoding functional, Al-activated transporters that play a role in tolerance by mediating Al-activated organic acid exudation in roots. The ZmALMT1 cDNA encodes a 451 amino acid protein containing six transmembrane helices. Transient expression of a ZmALMT1::GFP chimera confirmed that the protein is targeted to the plant cell plasma membrane. We addressed whether ZmALMT1 might underlie the Al-resistance response (i.e. Al-activated citrate exudation) observed in the roots of the Al-tolerant genotype. The physiological, gene expression and functional data from this study confirm that ZmALMT1 is a plasma membrane transporter that is capable of mediating elective anion efflux and influx. However, gene expression data as well as biophysical transport characteristics obtained from Xenopus oocytes expressing ZmALMT1 indicate that this transporter is implicated in the selective transport of anions involved in mineral nutrition and ion homeostasis processes, rather than mediating a specific Al-activated citrate exudation response at the rhizosphere of maize roots."

"18299319","abstracttext_background","Coeliac disease is a small intestine enteropathy caused by permanent intolerance to wheat gluten.

"15128573","abstracttext","Phenazine antibiotic production in the biological control bacterium Pseudomonas aureofaciens 30-84 is regulated in part via the PhzR/PhzI N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) system. Previous work showed that a subpopulation of the wheat rhizosphere community positively affected phenazine gene expression in strain 30-84 via AHL signals (E. A. Pierson, D. W. Wood, J. A. Cannon, F. M. Blachere, and L. S. Pierson III, Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 11:1078-1084, 1998). In the present work, a second subpopulation, one that negatively affected phenazine gene expression, was identified from this rhizosphere community. Strain 30-84 grown in conditioned medium (CM) from several strains produced lower levels of phenazines (1.5- to 9.3-fold) than control when grown in CM from the strain 30-84I(1)/I(2). Growth of the phzB::lacZ reporter strain 30-84Z in this CM resulted in decreased lacZ expression (4.3- to 9.2-fold) compared to growth of the control strain in CM, indicating that inhibition of phzB occurred at the level of gene expression. Preliminary chemical and biological characterizations suggested that these signals, unlike other identified negative signals, were not extractable in ethyl acetate. Introduction of extra copies of phzR and phzI, but not phzI alone, in trans into strain 30-84Z reduced the negative effect on phzB::lacZ expression. The presence of negative-signal-producing strains in a mixture with strain 30-84 reduced strain 30-84's ability to inhibit the take-all disease pathogen in vitro. Together, the results from the previous work on the positive-signal subpopulation and the present work on the negative-signal subpopulation suggest that cross-communication among members of the rhizosphere community and strain 30-84 may control secondary metabolite production and pathogen inhibition."

"14965898","abstracttext","Recent molecular phylogenetic studies of polyploid plants have successfully clarified complex patterns of reticulate evolution. In this study of Elymus repens, an allohexaploid member of the wheat tribe Triticeae, chloroplast and nuclear DNA data reveal an extreme reticulate pattern, revealing at least five distinct gene lineages coexisting within the species, acquired through a possible combination of allohexaploidy and introgression from both within and beyond the Triticeae. Earlier cytogenetic studies of E. repens suggested that Hordeum (genome H) and Pseudoroegneria (St) were genome donors to E. repens. Chloroplast DNA data presented here (from the rpoA gene and from the region between trnT and trnF) identify three potential maternal genome donors (Pseudoroegneria, Thinopyrum, and Dasypyrum), and information from previous molecular work suggests that, of these, Pseudoroegneria is the most likely maternal donor. Nuclear starch synthase gene data indicate that both Hordeum and Pseudoroegneria have contributed to the nuclear genome of E. repens, in agreement with cytogenetic data. However, these data also show unexpected contributions from Taeniatherum, and from two additional donors of unknown identity. One of the sequences of unknown origin falls within the Triticeae, but is not closely associated with any of the sampled diploid genera. The second falls outside of the clade containing Triticeae and its outgroup Bromus, suggesting the acquisition of genetic material from a surprisingly divergent source. Bias toward the amplification of certain starch synthase variants has complicated attempts to thoroughly sample from within individuals, but the data clearly indicate a complex pattern of reticulate evolution, consistent not only with allohexaploidy, but also with introgression from unexpectedly divergent sources."

"16305340","abstracttext","Stem cell factor (SCF) stimulation of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit has effects on the proliferation, differentiation, and apoptotic regulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell populations. Rat bone marrow myelomonocytic stem cells (MSC) isolated in vitro by wheat germ agglutinin culture exclusively undergo self-renewal divisions when stimulated by SCF but bipotentially differentiate in the presence of dexamethasone or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) to granulocytes and macrophages, respectively. We show here that withdrawal of SCF from MSC induces rapid apoptosis in all stages of the cell cycle accompanied by development of an ultrastructural apoptotic morphology. To investigate immediate-early gene induction during MSC apoptosis, a differential display polymerase chain reaction (DD-PCR) screen coupled with rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR was performed. An immediate-early apoptosis response gene was isolated from growth factor-deprived MSC that was not expressed during self-renewal or differentiation induction cultures containing SCF. The protein contains a PEST region enriched in proline, glutamic acid, serine, and threonine residues common to proteins with a high turnover and has a cytoplasmic, vesicular localization in apoptotic MSC shown by immunohistochemistry. The human orthologous gene, isolated by RACE PCR, shows 86% homology to the rat protein and high similarity with a human uncharacterized hypothalamus predicted protein (HSMNP1) localized to the long arm of chromosome 20. Because deletions in this region are a common occurrence in a wide range of myeloproliferative disorders characterized by treatment resistance to apoptosis, HSMNP1 expression may play a role in normal and pathological myeloid development."

"16270906","abstracttext_background","In situ hybridisation can provide cellular, and in some cases sub-cellular, resolution of mRNA levels within multicellular organisms and is widely used to provide spatial and temporal information on gene expression. However, standard protocols are complex and laborious to implement, restricting analysis to one or a few genes at any one time. Whole-mount and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) based protocols increase throughput, but can compromise both specificity and resolution. With the advent of genome-wide analysis of gene expression, there is an urgent need to develop high-throughput in situ methods that also provide high resolution."
"16270906","abstracttext_results","Here we describe the development of a method for performing high-throughput in situ hybridisations that retains both the high resolution and the specificity of the best manual versions. This refined semi-automated protocol has the potential for determining the spatial and temporal expression patterns of hundreds of genes in parallel on a variety of tissues. We show how tissue sections can be organized on microscope slides in a manner that allows the screening of multiple probes on each slide. Slide handling, hybridisation and processing steps have been streamlined providing a capacity of at least 200 probes per week (depending on the tissue type). The technique can be applied easily to different species and tissue types, and we illustrate this with wheat seed and Arabidopsis floral meristems, siliques and seedlings."

This method has the potential to provide an analysis of gene expression patterns at the genome level."

"16159942","abstracttext_background","Plant evolutionary theory has been greatly enriched by studies on crop species. Over the last century, important information has been generated on many aspects of population biology, speciation and polyploid genetics."
"16159942","abstracttext_scope","Searches for quantitative trait loci (QTL) in crop species have uncovered numerous blocks of genes that have dramatic effects on adaptation, particularly during the domestication process. Many of these QTL have epistatic and pleiotropic effects making rapid evolutionary change possible. Most of the pioneering work on the molecular basis of self-incompatibility has been conducted on crop species, along with the sequencing of the phytopathogenic resistance genes (R genes) responsible for the 'gene-to-gene' relations of coevolution observed in host-pathogen relationships. Some of the better examples of co-adaptation and early acting inbreeding depression have also been elucidated in crops. Crop-wild progenitor interactions have provided rich opportunities to study the evolution of novel adaptations subsequent to hybridization. Most crop/wild F1 hybrids have reduced fitness, but in some instances the crop relatives have acquired genes that make them more efficient weeds through crop mimicry. Studies on autopolyploid alfalfa and potato have uncovered the means by which polyploid gametes are formed and have led to hypotheses about how multiallelic interactions are associated with fitness and self-fertility. Research on the cole crops and wheat has discovered that newly formed polyploids can undergo dramatic genome rearrangements that could lead to rapid evolutionary change."

The rice sequence data can be used to study the origin of genes and gene families, track rates of sequence divergence over time, and provide hints about how genes evolve and generate products with novel biological properties. The rice sequence data has already been mined to show that transposable elements often carry fragments of cellular genes. This type of genome shuffling could play a role in creating novel, reorganized genes with new adaptive properties."

"16738112","abstracttext","The genus Herbaspirillum of the Betaproteobacteria mainly comprises diazotrophic bacteria with a potential for endophytic and systemic colonization of a variety of plants. The plant-associated bacterial isolates N3(T), N5 and N9 were derived from surface-sterilized wheat roots. After phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data the isolates could be allocated to the genus Herbaspirillum, and 99.9 % similarity to the sequence of Herbaspirillum lusitanum P6-12(T) was found. A set of 16S rRNA gene-targeted oligonucleotide probes was developed for the identification of the three novel isolates and H. lusitanum (Hhilu446), and for the specific detection of several other Herbaspirillum species described recently. For higher phylogenetic resolution, the 23S rRNA gene sequences of all members of the genus was sequenced and used to construct a phylogenetic tree. Isolates N3(T), N5 and N9 formed a group that was distinct from all other Herbaspirillum species. In addition, isolate N3(T) and H. lusitanum P6-12(T) exhibited a DNA-DNA hybridization value of only 25 %. The value for DNA-DNA hybridization between N3(T) and other members of the genus Herbaspirillum was between 14 and 32 %; DNA-DNA hybridization between strain N3(T) and isolates N5 and N9 produced values above 95 %. This places the three isolates as representatives of a novel species within the genus Herbaspirillum. A Biolog GN2 assay supported this conclusion. The major fatty acids were C(16 : 1)omega7c, C(16 : 0) and C(18 : 1)omega7c, and the DNA G+C content ranged from 60.9 to 61.5 mol%. Therefore these three isolates should be classified within a novel species, for which the name Herbaspirillum hiltneri sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is N3(T) (=DSM 17495(T)=LMG 23131(T))."

"18944055","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Septoria speckled leaf blotch (SSLB), caused by Septoria passerinii, has emerged as one of the most important foliar diseases of barley in the Upper Midwest region of the United States. To map and tag genes for SSLB resistance, we developed two populations derived from the resistant accessions CIho 4780 and CIho 10644 and the susceptible malting cv. Foster. Segregation analysis of F(2) plants or F(2:3) families from the Foster/CIho 4780 and Foster/CIho 10644 populations revealed that a single dominant gene conferred resistance at the seedling stage. Bulked segregant analysis identified an amplified fragment length polymorphism marker, E-ACT/M-CAA-170, that co-segregated with the SSLB resistance gene Rsp2 in the Foster/CIho 4780 F(2) population. Southern hybridization analysis with DNA from the wheat/barley addition lines localized E-ACT/M-CAA-170 on the short arm of the barley chromosome 5(1H). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis with DNA clones previously mapped to the short arm of chromosome 5(1H) placed Rsp2 at a position flanked by the markers Act8 and ksuD14. A sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) marker (E-ACT/M-CAA-170a) was developed that co-segregated with not only Rsp2 in the Foster/CIho 4780 population but also resistance gene Rsp3 in the Foster/CIho 10644 population. This result indicates that Rsp3 is closely linked to Rsp2 on the short arm of chromosome 5(1H). The utility of SCAR marker E-ACT/M-CAA-170a for selecting Rsp2 in two different breeding populations was validated."

"19937262","abstracttext","Resistance to stripe rust in wheat is a preferred method of disease prevention. Race-specific all-stage resistance usually provides complete protection; thus an understanding of the molecular control of race-specific resistance is important. To build on previous studies of race-specific resistance controlled by the Yr5 gene, this study reports the construction and use of a custom oligonucleotide microarray to perform a meta-analysis of the transcriptional response involved in race-specific resistance conferred by Yr1, Yr5, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr10, Yr15, and Yr17. By profiling the response of eight resistance genes in a common background, we identified 28 transcripts significantly involved in the resistance phenotype across all genotypes. The most significant of these were annotated as blue copper-binding protein, heat-stress transcription factor, pathogen-induced WIR1A protein, and ent-kaurene synthase transcripts. Unique transcripts significant in each genotype were also identified, which highlighted some transcriptional events specific to certain genotypes. The approach was effective in narrowing down the list of candidate genes in comparison to studying individual genotypes. Annotation revealed key gene expression events involved in race-specific resistance. The results confirm the activity of known R-gene-mediated pathway race-specific resistance, including an oxidative burst that likely contributes to a hypersensitive response, as well as pathogenesis-related protein expression and activity of the phenylpropanoid pathway. However, several identified transcripts remained unknown and may prove interesting candidates for further characterization."
"19918061","articletitle","PHS1 regulates meiotic recombination and homologous chromosome pairing by controlling the transport of RAD50 to the nucleus."
"19918061","abstracttext","Recombination and pairing of homologous chromosomes are critical for bivalent formation in meiotic prophase. In many organisms, including yeast, mammals, and plants, pairing and recombination are intimately interconnected. The POOR HOMOLOGOUS SYNAPSIS1 (PHS1) gene acts in coordination of chromosome pairing and early recombination steps in plants, ensuring pairing fidelity and proper repair of meiotic DNA double-strand-breaks. In phs1 mutants, chromosomes exhibit early recombination defects and frequently associate with non-homologous partners, instead of pairing with their proper homologs. Here, we show that the product of the PHS1 gene is a cytoplasmic protein that functions by controlling transport of RAD50 from cytoplasm to the nucleus. RAD50 is a component of the MRN protein complex that processes meiotic double-strand-breaks to produce single-stranded DNA ends, which act in the homology search and recombination. We demonstrate that PHS1 plays the same role in homologous pairing in both Arabidopsis and maize, whose genomes differ dramatically in size and repetitive element content. This suggests that PHS1 affects pairing of the gene-rich fraction of the genome rather than preventing pairing between repetitive DNA elements. We propose that PHS1 is part of a system that regulates the progression of meiotic prophase by controlling entry of meiotic proteins into the nucleus. We also document that in phs1 mutants in Arabidopsis, centromeres interact before pairing commences along chromosome arms. Centromere coupling was previously observed in yeast and polyploid wheat while our data suggest that it may be a more common feature of meiosis."

Fifteen mRNA samples from various organs and treatments were pooled to develop a cDNA library using the CAP trapper method. More than 60% of the clones were confirmed to have complete coding sequences, based on comparison with rice amino acid and UniProt sequences. Blastn homologies (E<1E-5) to rice genes and Arabidopsis genes were 89 and 47%, respectively. Of the 5028 possible amino acid sequences derived from the 5006 FLcDNAs, 4032 (80.2%) were classified into 1678 GreenPhyl multigenic families. There were 555 cDNAs showing low homology to both rice and Arabidopsis. Gene ontology annotation by InterProScan indicated that many of these cDNAs (71%) have no known molecular functions and may be unique to barley. The cDNAs showed high homology to Barley 1 GeneChip oligo probes (81%) and the wheat gene index (84%). The high homology between FLcDNAs (27%) and mapped barley expressed sequence tag enabled assigning linkage map positions to 151-233 FLcDNAs on each of the seven barley chromosomes. These comprehensive barley FLcDNAs provide strong platform to connect pre-existing genomic and genetic resources and accelerate gene identification and genome analysis in barley and related species.

Here, we describe the differential expression of a number of newly identified barley chemically induced (BCI) genes encoding a lipoxygenase (BCI-1), a thionin (BCI-2), an acid phosphatase (BCI-3), a Ca(2+)-binding EF-hand protein (BCI-4), a serine proteinase inhibitor (BCI-7), a fatty acid desaturase (BCI-8) and several further proteins with as yet unknown function. Compared with SA, the chemicals DCINA and BTH were more potent inducers of both gene expression and resistance. Homologues of four BCI genes were detected in wheat and were also differentially regulated upon chemical activation of disease resistance. Except for BCI-4 and BCI-5 (unknown function), the genes were also induced by exogenous application of jasmonates, whereas treatments that raise endogenous jasmonates as well as wounding were less effective. The fact that BCI genes were not expressed during incompatible barley-Bgh interactions governed by gene-for-gene relationships suggests the presence of separate pathways leading to powdery mildew resistance."

"19719693","abstracttext","Abstract Pyrrolnitrin (PRN) and pyoluteorin (PLT) are broad-spectrum antibiotics produced by several strains of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species. Both antibiotics play an important role in the suppression of multiple plant pathogenic fungi. Primers were developed from conserved sequences and amplified prnD and pltC fragments from 18 Pseudomonas and four Burkholderia spp. of worldwide origin that produce either PRN or PLT or both. Subsequent RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphisms) analysis of the 438-bp pltC fragment showed no polymorphisms among PLT-producing Pseudomonas strains. Polymorphisms within the 786-bp prnD fragment, however, allowed the assessment of the diversity among PRN-producing Pseudomonas and Burkholderia spp. to a level similar to that obtained by three 10-mer primers in random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rDNA sequences of strains representative of PRN-producing Pseudomonas and Burkholderia species correlated well with their taxonomic status. Phylogenetic relationships inferred from each of the four prn genes and from the complete sequence of the prn biosynthetic locus were similar to 16S rDNA-based phylogeny for most strains, except for Burkholderia pyrrocinia DSM 10685. Both RFLP analysis and comparison of the prn gene sequences showed that B. pyrrocinia DSM 10685 was more closely related to PRN-producing Pseudomonas strains, suggesting that lateral gene transfer may have occurred. Colony hybridization and PCR with PRN- and PLT-specific probes and primers showed that Pseudomonas and Burkholderia spp. harboring the prnD and pltC gene were not present at detectable levels on roots of wheat grown in five agricultural soils collected in The Netherlands, two of them being naturally suppressive to Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici. These results suggest that PRN- and PLT-producing Pseudomonas and Burkholderia sp. do not contribute to the natural suppressiveness found in these Dutch take-all decline soils."

"19900007","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Wheat head blight caused by Gibberella zeae (anamorph: Fusarium graminearum) is a threat to food safety in China because of mycotoxin contamination of the harvested grain, the frequent occurrence of the disease, and the failure of chemical control in some areas due to benzimidazole resistance in the pathogen population. The molecular resistance mechanism, however, of G. zeae to benzimidazole fungicides (especially carbendazim; active ingredient: methyl benzimidazol-2-yl carbamate [MBC]) is poorly understood. DNA sequences of a beta-tubulin gene (beta(2)tub) (GenBank access number FG06611.1) in G. zeae were analyzed. Mutations in beta(2)tub in moderately resistant strains (MBC(MR)) included TTT (Phe)-->TAT (Tyr) at codon 167 or TTC (Phe)-->TAC (Tyr) at codon 200. A highly resistant strain (MBC(HR)) had two point mutations, one at codon 73, CAG (Gln)-->CGG (Arg), and the other at codon 198, GAG (Glu)-->CTG (Leu). To confirm that mutations in the beta(2)tub confer resistance to benzimidazole fungicides, the entire beta(2)tub locus was deleted from MBC(MR) and MBC(HR) strains of G. zeae. The resulting Deltabeta(2)tub mutants from both MBC(MR) and MBC(HR) strains grew normally on MBC-free potato dextrose agar medium and were supersensitive to MBC. Complementation of the Deltabeta(2)tub mutants by transformation with a copy of the intact beta(2)tub locus from their parent strains exhibited less resistance than the original strains, and complementation of the Deltabeta(2)tub mutants by transformation with a copy of the intact beta(2)tub locus from sensitive strains restored MBC sensitivity. The results indicated that the mutations in the beta(2)tub gene conferred resistance of G. zeae to benzimidazole fungicides and this gene can be used as a genetic marker in G. zeae."
"21856827","articletitle","Pyrroloquinoline quinone biosynthesis gene pqqC, a novel molecular marker for studying the phylogeny and diversity of phosphate-solubilizing pseudomonads."
"21856827","abstracttext","Many root-colonizing pseudomonads are able to promote plant growth by increasing phosphate availability in soil through solubilization of poorly soluble rock phosphates. The major mechanism of phosphate solubilization by pseudomonads is the secretion of gluconic acid, which requires the enzyme glucose dehydrogenase and its cofactor pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ). The main aim of this study was to evaluate whether a PQQ biosynthetic gene is suitable to study the phylogeny of phosphate-solubilizing pseudomonads. To this end, two new primers, which specifically amplify the pqqC gene of the Pseudomonas genus, were designed. pqqC fragments were amplified and sequenced from a Pseudomonas strain collection and from a natural wheat rhizosphere population using cultivation-dependent and cultivation-independent approaches. Phylogenetic trees based on pqqC sequences were compared to trees obtained with the two concatenated housekeeping genes rpoD and gyrB. For both pqqC and rpoD-gyrB, similar main phylogenetic clusters were found. However, in the pqqC but not in the rpoD-gyrB tree, the group of fluorescent pseudomonads producing the antifungal compounds 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and pyoluteorin was located outside the Pseudomonas fluorescens group. pqqC sequences from isolated pseudomonads were differently distributed among the identified phylogenetic groups than pqqC sequences derived from the cultivation-independent approach. Comparing pqqC phylogeny and phosphate solubilization activity, we identified one phylogenetic group with high solubilization activity. In summary, we demonstrate that the gene pqqC is a novel molecular marker that can be used complementary to housekeeping genes for studying the diversity and evolution of plant-beneficial pseudomonads."

"22916966","abstracttext","In this study, the hypothesis that food-derived opioid peptides besides β-casomorphin 7 might modulate the production of mucin via a direct action on epithelial goblet cells was investigated in HT29-MTX cells used as a model of human colonic epithelium. Seven milk whey or casein peptides, a human milk peptide, and a wheat gluten-derived peptide with proved or probable ability to bind μ- or δ-opioid receptors were tested on the cell culture. Significantly increased secretion of mucins was found after exposure to six of the assayed peptides, besides the previously described β-casomorphin 7, as measured by an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA). Human β-casomorphin 5 and α-lactorphin were selected to study the expression of mucin 5AC gene (MUC5AC), the HT29-MTX major secreted mucin gene. α-Lactorphin showed increased expression of MUC5AC from 4 to 24 h (up to 1.6-fold over basal level expression), although differences were statistically different only after 24 h of exposure. However, this increased expression of MUC5AC did not reach significance after cell treatment with human β-casomorphin 5. In conclusion, six food-derived peptides have been identifed with described or probable opioid activity that induce mucin secretion in HT29-MTX cells. Concretely, α-lactorphin is able to up-regulate the expression of the major secreted mucin gene encoded by these cells."
"22610360","articletitle","Durable resistance to stripe rust is due to three specific resistance genes in French bread wheat cultivar Apache."
"22610360","abstracttext","Quantitative resistance is postulated to be more durable than qualitative (R-gene mediated) resistance, which is usually quickly overcome by the pathogen population. Despite its wide use for nearly 10 years in France, the French bread wheat cultivar Apache remains resistant to stripe rust. Here, we investigated the genetic architecture of cv. Apache resistance to examine whether its durability could be explained by quantitative characteristics. We identified quantitative trait loci (QTL) by composite interval mapping of disease progress data recorded throughout 4 years of field assays. These assays included inoculation with three different pathotypes on a segregating population originating from a cross between cv. Apache and cv. Taldor, a French cultivar susceptible to stripe rust. Three QTLs derived from Apache, QYr.inra-2AS, QYr.inra-2BL and QYr.inra-4B, were detected. Each of these QTLs contributed between approximately 15 and 69 % of the phenotypic variance and corresponds to a race-specific resistance gene. We showed that QYr.inra-2AS and QYr.inra-2BS map to the positions of Yr17 and Yr7, respectively, whereas QYr.inra-4B corresponds to an adult plant resistance gene. Our results demonstrate that a combination of two or more race-specific resistance genes can confer durable resistance provided that it is properly managed at a continental level. Race-specific resistance genes should not be removed from breeding programs provided that they are properly managed."
"20804457","articletitle","Intragenic allele pyramiding combines different specificities of wheat Pm3 resistance alleles."
"20804457","abstracttext","Some plant resistance genes occur as allelic series, with each member conferring specific resistance against a subset of pathogen races. In wheat, there are 17 alleles of the Pm3 gene. They encode nucleotide-binding (NB-ARC) and leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) domain proteins, which mediate resistance to distinct race spectra of powdery mildew. It is not known if specificities from different alleles can be combined to create resistance genes with broader specificity. Here, we used an approach based on avirulence analysis of pathogen populations to characterize the molecular basis of Pm3 recognition spectra. A large survey of mildew races for avirulence on the Pm3 alleles revealed that Pm3a has a resistance spectrum that completely contains that of Pm3f, but also extends towards additional races. The same is true for the Pm3b and Pm3c gene pair. The molecular analysis of these allelic pairs revealed a role of the NB-ARC protein domain in the efficiency of effector-dependent resistance. Analysis of the wild-type and chimeric Pm3 alleles identified single residues in the C-terminal LRR motifs as the main determinant of allele specificity. Variable residues of the N-terminal LRRs are necessary, but not sufficient, to confer resistance specificity. Based on these data, we constructed a chimeric Pm3 gene by intragenic allele pyramiding of Pm3d and Pm3e that showed the combined resistance specificity and, thus, a broader recognition spectrum compared with the parental alleles. Our findings support a model of stepwise evolution of Pm3 recognition specificities."
"21071105","articletitle","The CYP51C gene, a reliable marker to resolve interspecific phylogenetic relationships within the Fusarium species complex and a novel target for species-specific PCR."
"21071105","abstracttext","Early diagnosis and control of different Fusarium species is essential for successful management of plant disease and subsequent prevention of toxins entering the food chain. This issue can be addressed using phylogenetic analyses and other molecular techniques, including the design of species-specific primers and corresponding PCR assays. In practice, only a few genes are sequenced for most species and insights into the evolutionary mechanisms at the species level usually stem from phylogenetic analyses of only one or a small number of genetic loci. This poses the question of whether the recovered tree accurately reflects the relationships among species or rather more local interrelationships particular to the genetic marker employed. This study examined if the Fusarium-specific CYP51C gene can be used to establish evolutionary relationships between Fusarium species and enable species-specific detection. The resolving power of the CYP51C gene was studied for 46 Fusarium isolates representing 18 different species. The resulting phylogeny analysis showed clear and well-structured separation of the isolates according to their species rank, synthesised toxin and Fusarium section. Moreover, a comparison between the individual CYP51C phylogeny and a reference tree (inferred from the concatenation of ITS, CYP51C, β-tubulin and TEF-1α sequences) indicated superior resolution of CYP51C relative to ITS and β-tubulin sequences. In addition to its suitability as a reliable marker for diagnosis of different toxigenic Fusarium species, we also show that the CYP51C gene is a promising target for development of species-specific PCR. This was demonstrated by the specific detection of Fusarium cerealis in grain samples of wheat."
"20802018","articletitle","A novel gene, ROA, is required for normal morphogenesis and discharge of ascospores in Gibberella zeae."
"20802018","abstracttext","Head blight, caused by Gibberella zeae, is a significant disease among cereal crops, including wheat, barley, and rice, due to contamination of grain with mycotoxins. G. zeae is spread by ascospores forcibly discharged from sexual fruiting bodies forming on crop residues. In this study, we characterized a novel gene, ROA, which is required for normal sexual development. Deletion of ROA (Δroa) resulted in an abnormal size and shape of asci and ascospores but did not affect vegetative growth. The Δroa mutation triggered round ascospores and insufficient cell division after spore delimitation. The asci of the Δroa strain discharged fewer ascospores from the perithecia but achieved a greater dispersal distance than those of the wild-type strain. Turgor pressure within the asci was calculated through the analysis of osmolytes in the epiplasmic fluid. Deletion of the ROA gene appeared to increase turgor pressure in the mutant asci. The higher turgor pressure of the Δroa mutant asci and the mutant spore shape contributed to the longer distance dispersal. When the Δroa mutant was outcrossed with a Δmat1-2 mutant, a strain that contains a green fluorescence protein (GFP) marker in place of the MAT1-2 gene, unusual phenotypic segregation occurred. The ratio of GFP to non-GFP segregation was 1:1; however, all eight spores had the same shape. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that ROA plays multiple roles in maintaining the proper morphology and discharge of ascospores in G. zeae."
"21153767","articletitle","Functional characterization of a plasma membrane Na+/H+ antiporter from alkali grass (Puccinellia tenuiflora)."
"21153767","abstracttext","We have cloned a Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene (GenBank accession no EF440291, PtNHA1) from Puccinellia tenuiflora (so-called alkali grass in Chinese) roots under NaCl salt stress. Its cDNA is 3775 bp and contains a 3414 bp open reading frame. The amino acid sequences of PtNHA1 show high identities with a putative plasma membrane Na(+)/H(+) antiporter from wheat. PtNHA1 was predicted to contain 11 hypothetical transmembrane domains in the N-terminal part and to localize in the plasma membrane. Genomic DNA gel blot analysis shows that PtNHA1 is a single-copy gene in the alkali grass genome. PtNHA1 is highly expressed in leaves, roots and shoots by RNA gel blot analysis. Furthermore, PtNHA1 gene expression of alkali grass was clearly up-regulated by NaCl salt stress. Overexpression of PtNHA1 in Arabidopsis resulted in enhanced tolerance of transgenic plants to NaCl stress. The ion contents analysis shows that, compared with the wild-type (WT), less Na(+) and more K(+) were accumulated in transgenic plants under NaCl stress. The results indicate that PtNHA1 play an important role in NaCl salt stress. Additionally, compared with the WT, total activities of ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT), two key reactive oxygen species (ROS) detoxifying enzymes were high in transgenic plants under salt stress, respectively. The transcript levels of two APX genes (Apx1, s/mApx) and two CAT genes (Cat1, Cat2) in transgenic plants were higher than those in WT. This suggests that overexpression of PtNHA1 results in enhanced ROS-scavenging enzymes of transgenic plants under NaCl salt stress."

"21136526","abstracttext","Changes in animal nutrition, particularly essential dietary components, alter global gene expression patterns. Our goal is to identify molecular markers that serve as early indicators of the quality of insect culture media. Markers of deficient culture media will increase the efficiency of developing optimal systems for mass rearing beneficial insects and some pest species because decisions on culture media quality can be made without waiting through one or several life cycles. The objective of our current study is to discover molecular markers of essential dietary lipid deficiency in the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. We reared groups of fruit flies separately on media either devoid of or supplemented with wheat germ oil (WGO) and analyzed gene expression in third instar larvae and F(1) eggs using 2D electrophoresis. Gel densitometry revealed significant changes in expression levels of genes encoding eight proteins in larvae and 22 proteins in eggs. We identified these proteins by using mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF/TOF) and bioinformatic analyses of the protein sequences. Among these, we identified one gene encoding the receptor of activated C Kinase 1 (RACK1) that increased in expression by 6.8-fold in eggs from adults that were reared as larvae on media supplemented with WGO. RACK1 is an essential component of at least three intracellular signal transduction pathways, making it a good molecular marker candidate of lipid deficiency in fruit flies and possibly many other insect species."
"21438988","articletitle","Transgenic Pm3b wheat lines show resistance to powdery mildew in the field."
"21438988","abstracttext","Plant resistance (R) genes are highly effective in protecting plants against diseases, but pathogens can overcome such genes relatively easily by adaptation. Consequently, in many cases R genes do not confer durable resistance in agricultural environments. One possible strategy to make the use of R genes more sustainable depends on the modification of R genes followed by transformation. To test a possible transgenic use of R genes, we overexpressed in wheat the Pm3b resistance gene against powdery mildew under control of the maize ubiquitin promoter. Four independent transgenic lines were tested in the greenhouse and the field during 3 years. The four lines showed a five- to 600-fold transgene overexpression compared with the expression of the endogenous Pm3b gene in the landrace 'Chul'. Powdery mildew resistance was significantly improved in all lines in the greenhouse and the field, both with naturally occurring infection or after artificial inoculation. Under controlled environmental conditions, the line with the strongest overexpression of the Pm3b gene showed a dramatic increase in resistance to powdery mildew isolates that are virulent on the endogenous Pm3b. Under a variety of field conditions, but never in the greenhouse, three of the four transgenic lines showed pleiotropic effects on spike and leaf morphology. The highest overexpressing line had the strongest side effects, suggesting a correlation between expression level and phenotypic changes. These results demonstrate that the successful transgenic use of R genes critically depends on achieving an optimal level of their expression, possibly in a tissue-specific way."

A genetic map was constructed consisting of 1,494 polymorphic probes (SSRs, DArTs, and ESTs) mapped to 558 unique loci, and QTL analysis revealed the presence of four stripe rust resistance QTL segregating in this population, two from UC1110 (on chromosomes 3BS and 2BS) and two from PI610750 (5AL and 2AS). The two QTL of largest effects (on 3BS and 5AL) were validated in independent populations and their intervals narrowed to 2.5 and 5.3 cM, respectively. The 3BS QTL was shown, by allelism test and genotype, to carry a gene different from the Yr30/Sr2 complex. Mapped position also suggests that the 3BS QTL is associated with a gene different from either Yrns-B1 or YrRub, two stripe rust resistance genes mapped to this region in other studies. The 5AL QTL carries a previously unreported partial stripe rust resistance gene, designated here as Yr48. This paper discusses the individual contributions to resistance of these four QTL, their epistatic interactions, and their potential in durable resistance breeding strategies based on combinations of partial resistance genes."
"21388746","articletitle","A novel embryological theory of autism causation involving endogenous biochemicals capable of initiating cellular gene transcription: a possible link between twelve autism risk factors and the autism 'epidemic'."
"21388746","abstracttext","Human alpha-fetoprotein is a pregnancy-associated protein with an undetermined physiological role. As human alpha-fetoprotein binds retinoids and inhibits estrogen-dependent cancer cell proliferation, and because retinoic acid (a retinol metabolite) and estradiol (an estrogen) can both initiate cellular gene transcription, it is hypothesized here that alpha-fetoprotein functions during critical gestational periods to prevent retinoic acid and maternal estradiol from inappropriately stimulating gene expression in developing brain regions which are sensitive to these chemicals. Prenatal/maternal factors linked to increased autism risk include valproic acid, thalidomide, alcohol, rubella, cytomegalovirus, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autoimmune disease, stress, allergic reaction, and hypothyroidism. It will be shown how each of these risk factors may initiate expression of genes which are sensitive to retinoic acid and/or estradiol - whether by direct promotion or by reducing production of alpha-fetoprotein. It is thus hypothesized here that autism is not a genetic disorder, but is rather an epigenetic disruption in brain development caused by gestational exposure to chemicals and/or conditions which either inhibit alpha-fetoprotein production or directly promote retinoic acid-sensitive or estradiol-sensitive gene expression. This causation model leads to potential chemical explanations for autistic brain morphology, the distinct symptomatology of Asperger's syndrome, and the differences between high-functioning and low-functioning autism with regard to mental retardation, physical malformation, and sex ratio. It will be discussed how folic acid may cause autism under the retinoic acid/estradiol model, and the history of prenatal folic acid supplementation will be shown to coincide with the history of what is popularly known as the autism epidemic. It is thus hypothesized here that prenatal folic acid supplementation has contributed to the post-1980 increase in US autism diagnoses. In addition to explaining the epidemic within the wider retinoic acid/estradiol model of causation, this theory leads to potential explanations for certain genetic findings in autism, autistic regression, and changing trends in autism symptomatology with regard to mental retardation, wheat allergy, and gastrointestinal problems."

"22102918","abstracttext","Pyrazinamide (PZA) is an important first-line anti-tuberculosis drug. But PZA susceptibility test is challenging because PZA activity is optimal only in an acid environment that inhibits the growth of M. tuberculosis. For current phenotypic methods, inconsistent results between different labs have been reported. Direct sequencing of pncA gene is being considered as an accurate predictor for PZA susceptibility, but this approach needs expensive sequencers and a mutation database to report the results. An in-vitro synthesized Pyrazinamidase (PZase) assay was developed based on PCR amplification of pncA gene and an in vitro wheat germ system to express the pncA gene into PZase. The activity of the synthesized PZase was used as an indicator for PZA susceptibility. Fifty-one clinical isolates were tested along with pncA sequencing and the BACTEC MGIT 960 methods. The in-vitro synthesized PZase assay was able to detect PZA susceptibility of M. tuberculosis within 24 h through observing the color difference either by a spectrometer or naked eyes. This method showed agreements of 100% (33/33) and 88% (14/16) with the pncA sequencing method, and agreements of 96% (27/28) and 65% (15/23) with the BACTEC MGIT 960 method, for susceptible and resistant strains, respectively. The novel in-vitro synthesized PZase assay has significant advantages over current methods, such as its fast speed, simplicity, no need for expensive equipment, and the potentials of being a direct test, predicting resistance level and easy reading results by naked eyes. After confirmation by more clinical tests, this method may provide a radical change to the current PZA susceptibility assays."

The purpose of this study was to describe a combined proteomics and genomics approach to comprehensively evaluate clinical and immunological phenotypes of patients affected by IPEX. T cell receptor (TCR)-Vβ repertoire and peripheral blood lymphocytes phenotype from three brothers affected by IPEX were studied by flow cytometry. Specific immunoglobulin (Ig)E were evaluated by means of an allergenic molecules microarray [immuno solid-phase allergen chip (ISAC)]. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays to obtain quantitative gene-expression levels. No FOXP3 protein was detectable within CD127(-) CD25(high) CD4(+) T cells from peripheral blood. A T cell-naive phenotype (CD62L(+) CD45R0(-)) associated with a reduction of both CD26 and CD7 expression and a TCR-Vβ 8 and 22 family expansions were found. B lymphocytes were mainly CD5(+) (B1) cells expressing a naive phenotype (tcl1(+) CD27(-)). The three IPEX patients had severe food allergy and specific IgE reactivity to cow's milk allergens, a hen's egg allergen and a wheat allergen. Gene expression profile analysis revealed a dysregulation associated mainly with Th1/Th2 pathways. The multiplexing evaluation reported in this study represents a comprehensive approach in the assessment of genetic conditions affecting the immune system such as the IPEX syndrome, paving the way for the development of diagnostic tools to improve the standard clinical and immunological profiling of the disease."

"22326456","abstracttext","Changes in essential dietary components alter global gene expression patterns in animals. We reported on a proteomics study designed to identify molecular markers of deficiencies in culture media developed for the oriental fruit fly, Bactrocera dorsalis. In that study, we found significant changes in expression of 70 proteins in adults of larvae reared on media lacking wheat germ oil (WGO), compared to media supplemented with WGO. Of these, a gene encoding an insect chitin-binding protein was expressed at about 120-fold higher levels in adult males reared on media supplemented with WGO. We inferred it may be feasible to develop the gene as a molecular marker of dietary lipid deficiency. The work was focused, however, on analysis of 11 day old adults. We have no information on expression of the chitin-binding protein, nor on any other proteins at other adult ages. In this paper we address the idea that the whole animal proteome changes dynamically with age. We reared separate groups of fruit fly larvae on media with and without WGO supplementation and analyzed protein expression in adult males and females age 0, 4, 8 and 12 days old using 2D electrophoresis. Gel densitometry revealed significant increases (by >2-fold) and decreases (by >50%) in expression levels of 29 proteins in females and 10 in males. We identified these proteins by mass spectrometry on MALDI TOF/TOF and bioinformatic analyses of the protein sequences. Two proteins, peroxiredoxin (26-fold increase) and vitellogenin 1 (15-fold increase) increased in expression in day 8 females. The key finding is that most changes in protein expression occurred in day 8 females. We infer that the fruit fly proteome changes with adult age. The natural changes in proteome with adult age is a crucial aspect of developing these and other proteins into molecular markers of lipid deficiency in fruit flies and possibly other insect species."

"23316438","abstracttext","Pyrenophora tritici-repentis is a necrotrophic fungus causal to the disease tan spot of wheat, whose contribution to crop loss has increased significantly during the last few decades. Pathogenicity by this fungus is attributed to the production of host-selective toxins (HST), which are recognized by their host in a genotype-specific manner. To better understand the mechanisms that have led to the increase in disease incidence related to this pathogen, we sequenced the genomes of three P. tritici-repentis isolates. A pathogenic isolate that produces two known HSTs was used to assemble a reference nuclear genome of approximately 40 Mb composed of 11 chromosomes that encode 12,141 predicted genes. Comparison of the reference genome with those of a pathogenic isolate that produces a third HST, and a nonpathogenic isolate, showed the nonpathogen genome to be more diverged than those of the two pathogens. Examination of gene-coding regions has provided candidate pathogen-specific proteins and revealed gene families that may play a role in a necrotrophic lifestyle. Analysis of transposable elements suggests that their presence in the genome of pathogenic isolates contributes to the creation of novel genes, effector diversification, possible horizontal gene transfer events, identified copy number variation, and the first example of transduplication by DNA transposable elements in fungi. Overall, comparative analysis of these genomes provides evidence that pathogenicity in this species arose through an influx of transposable elements, which created a genetically flexible landscape that can easily respond to environmental changes."

"22443345","abstracttext","The Poaceae family, also known as the grasses, includes agronomically important cereal crops such as rice, maize, sorghum, and wheat. Previous comparative studies have shown that much of the gene content is shared among the grasses; however, functional conservation of orthologous genes has yet to be explored. To gain an understanding of the genome-wide patterns of evolution of gene expression across reproductive tissues, we employed a sequence-based approach to compare analogous transcriptomes in species representing three Poaceae subgroups including the Pooideae (Brachypodium distachyon), the Panicoideae (sorghum), and the Ehrhartoideae (rice). Our transcriptome analyses reveal that only a fraction of orthologous genes exhibit conserved expression patterns. A high proportion of conserved orthologs include genes that are upregulated in physiologically similar tissues such as leaves, anther, pistil, and embryo, while orthologs that are highly expressed in seeds show the most diverged expression patterns. More generally, we show that evolution of gene expression profiles and coding sequences in the grasses may be linked. Genes that are highly and broadly expressed tend to be conserved at the coding sequence level while genes with narrow expression patterns show accelerated rates of sequence evolution. We further show that orthologs in syntenic genomic blocks are more likely to share correlated expression patterns compared with non-syntenic orthologs. These findings are important for agricultural improvement because sequence information is transferred from model species, such as Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum to crop plants without sequenced genomes."

"22415161","abstracttext","Abiotic stress tolerance of plants is a very complex trait and involves multiple physiological and biochemical processes. Thus, the improvement of plant stress tolerance should involve pyramiding of multiple genes. In the present study, we report the construction and application of a bicistronic system, involving the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) sequence from the 5'UTR of the heat-shock protein of tobacco gene NtHSF-1, to the improvement of salt tolerance in transgenic tobacco plants. Two genes from wheat encoding two important vacuolar ion transporters, Na(+)/H(+) antiporter (TNHXS1) and H(+)-pyrophosphatase (TVP1), were linked via IRES to generate the bicistronic construct TNHXS1-IRES-TVP1. Molecular analysis of transgenic tobacco plants revealed the correct integration of the TNHXS1-IRES-TVP1construct into tobacco genome and the production of the full-length bicistronic mRNA from the 35S promoter. Ion transport analyses with tonoplast vesicles isolated from transgenic lines confirmed that single-transgenic lines TVP1cl19 and TNHXS1cl7 had greater H(+)-PPiase and Na(+)/H(+) antiport activity, respectively, than the WT. Interestingly, the co-expression of TVP1 and TNHXS1 increased both Na(+)/H(+) antiport and H(+)-PPiase activities and induced the H(+) pumping activity of the endogenous V-ATPase. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing TNHXS1-IRES-TVP1 showed a better performance than either of the single gene-transformed lines and the wild type plants when subjected to salt treatment. In addition, the TNHXS1-IRES-TVP1 transgenic plants accumulated less Na(+) and more K(+) in their leaf tissue than did the wild type and the single gene-transformed lines. These results demonstrate that IRES system, described herein, can co-ordinate the expression of two important abiotic stress-tolerance genes and that this expression system is a valuable tool for obtaining transgenic plants with improved salt tolerance."

"23053097","abstracttext","Weissella confusa and Weissella cibaria isolated from wheat sourdoughs produce, from sucrose, linear dextrans due to a single soluble dextransucrase. In this study, the first complete gene sequence encoding dextransucrase from a W. confusa strain (LBAE C39-2) along with the one from a W. cibaria strain (LBAE K39) were reported. Corresponding gene cloning was achieved using specific primers designed on the basis of the draft genome sequence of these species. Deduced amino acid sequence of W. confusa and W. cibaria dextransucrase revealed common structural features of the glycoside hydrolase family 70. Notably, the regions located in the vicinity of the catalytic triad (D, E, D) are highly conserved. However, comparison analysis also revealed that Weissella dextransucrases form a distinct phylogenetic group within glucansucrases of other lactic acid bacteria. We then cloned the W. confusa C39-2 dextransucrase gene and successfully expressed the mature corresponding enzyme in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme rDSRC39-2 catalyzed dextran synthesis from sucrose with a K m of 8.6 mM and a V max of 20 μmol/mg/min. According to (1)H and (13)C NMR analysis, the polymer is a linear class 1 dextran with 97.2 % α-(1→6) linkages and 2.8 % α-(1→3) branch linkages, similar to the one produced by W. confusa C39-2 strain. The enzyme exhibited optimum catalytic activity for temperatures ranging from 35 to 40 °C and a pH of 5.4 in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer. This novel dextransucrase is responsible for production of dextran with predominant α-(1→6) linkages that could find applications as food hydrocolloids."

"23072995","abstracttext","From a holistic perspective, the discovery of cellular plasticity, a very interesting property of totipotency, underlies many topical issues in biology with important medical applications, while transgenesis is a core research tool in biology. Partially known, some basic mechanisms involved in the regenerative property of cells and in their receptivity to transgenesis are common to plant and animal cells and highlight the principle of the unity of life. Transgenesis provides an important investigative instrument in plant physiology and is regarded as a valuable tool for crop improvement. The economic, social, cultural and scientific importance of cereals has led to a rich stream of research into their genetics, biology and evolution. Sustained efforts to achieve the results obtained in the fields of genetic engineering and applied biotechnology reflect this deep interest. Difficulties encountered in creating genetically modified cereals, especially wheat, highlighted the central notions of tissue culture regeneration and transformation competencies. From the perspective of combining or encountering these competencies in the same cell lineage, this reputedly recalcitrant species provides a stimulating biological system in which to explore the physiological and genetic complexity of both competencies. The former involves two phases, dedifferentiation and redifferentiation. Cells undergo development switches regulated by extrinsic and intrinsic factors. The re-entry into the cell division cycle progressively culminates in the development of organized structures. This is achieved by global chromatin reorganization associated with the reprogramming of the gene expression pattern. The latter is linked with surveillance mechanisms and DNA repair, aimed at maintaining genome integrity before cells move into mitosis, and with those mechanisms aimed at genome expression control and regulation. In order to clarify the biological basis of these two physiological properties and their interconnectedness, we look at both competencies at the core of defense/adaptive mechanisms and survival, between undifferentiated cell proliferation and organization, constituting a transition phase between two different dynamic regimes, a typical feature of critical dynamic systems. Opting for a candidate-gene strategy, several gene families could be proposed as relevant targets for investigating this hypothesis at the molecular level."
"22948437","articletitle","Accessing complex crop genomes with next-generation sequencing."
"22948437","abstracttext","Many important crop species have genomes originating from ancestral or recent polyploidisation events. Multiple homoeologous gene copies, chromosomal rearrangements and amplification of repetitive DNA within large and complex crop genomes can considerably complicate genome analysis and gene discovery by conventional, forward genetics approaches. On the other hand, ongoing technological advances in molecular genetics and genomics today offer unprecedented opportunities to analyse and access even more recalcitrant genomes. In this review, we describe next-generation sequencing and data analysis techniques that vastly improve our ability to dissect and mine genomes for causal genes underlying key traits and allelic variation of interest to breeders. We focus primarily on wheat and oilseed rape, two leading examples of major polyploid crop genomes whose size or complexity present different, significant challenges. In both cases, the latest DNA sequencing technologies, applied using quite different approaches, have enabled considerable progress towards unravelling the respective genomes. Our ability to discover the extent and distribution of genetic diversity in crop gene pools, and its relationship to yield and quality-related traits, is swiftly gathering momentum as DNA sequencing and the bioinformatic tools to deal with growing quantities of genomic data continue to develop. In the coming decade, genomic and transcriptomic sequencing, discovery and high-throughput screening of single nucleotide polymorphisms, presence-absence variations and other structural chromosomal variants in diverse germplasm collections will give detailed insight into the origins, domestication and available trait-relevant variation of polyploid crops, in the process facilitating novel approaches and possibilities for genomics-assisted breeding."

"24692647","abstracttext","Malate and citrate efflux from root apices is a mechanism of Al(3+) tolerance in many plant species. Citrate efflux is facilitated by members of the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound exudation) family localized to the plasma membrane of root cells. Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is among the most Al(3+)-sensitive cereal species but the small genotypic variation in tolerance that is present is correlated with citrate efflux via a MATE transporter named HvAACT1. This study used a biotechnological approach to increase the Al(3+) tolerance of barley by transforming it with two MATE genes that encode citrate transporters: SbMATE is the major Al(3+)-tolerance gene from sorghum whereas FRD3 is involved with Fe nutrition in Arabidopsis. Independent transgenic and null T3 lines were generated for both transgenes. Lines expressing SbMATE showed Al(3+)-activated citrate efflux from root apices and greater tolerance to Al(3+) toxicity than nulls in hydroponic and short-term soil trials. Transgenic lines expressing FRD3 exhibited similar phenotypes except citrate release from roots occurred constitutively. The Al(3+) tolerance of these lines was compared with previously generated transgenic barley lines overexpressing the endogenous HvAACT1 gene and the TaALMT1 gene from wheat. Barley lines expressing TaALMT1 showed significantly greater Al(3+) tolerance than all lines expressing MATE genes. This study highlights the relative efficacy of different organic anion transport proteins for increasing the Al(3+) tolerance of an important crop species."

"24120452","abstracttext","The soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt) causes take-all, a wheat root disease. In an original strain-specific way, a previous study indicates that inside the Ggt species, some strains grow preferentially at acidic pH and other strains at neutral/alkaline pH. The most important mechanism for a fungal response to the environmental pH is the Pal pathway which integrates the products of the six pal genes and the transcription factor PacC. To evaluate whether the Ggt strain-specific growth in function of the ambient pH is mediated via the Pal pathway, a transcriptional study of the genes encoding this pathway was carried out. This study provided the first evidence that the pH signalling pathway similar to those described in other fungi operated in Ggt. The pacC gene was induced at neutral pH whatever the strain. In an original way, the expression of Ggt genes coding for the different Pal proteins depended on the strain and on the ambient pH. In the strain growing better at acidic pH, few pal genes were pH-regulated, and some were overexpressed at neutral pH when regulated. In the strain growing better at neutral pH, underexpression of most of the pal genes at neutral pH occurred. The strains displayed higher gene expression in the ambient pH that unfavoured their growth as if it was a compensation system. All pH taken together, a globally weaker Pal transcript level occurred in the strains that were less sensitive to acidic pH, and on the contrary, the strain growing better on neutral pH showed higher Pal mRNA levels. The expression of genes involved in pathogenesis and saprophytic growth was also regulated by the ambient pH and the strain: each gene displayed a specific pH-regulation that was similar between strains. But all pH taken together, the global transcript levels of four out of six genes were higher in the strain growing better on neutral pH. Altogether, for the first time, the results show that inside a species, conditions affecting environmental pH modulate the expression of genes in an original strain-specific way."

"23912443","abstracttext","A novel nitrogen-fixing bacterium, BJ-18(T), was isolated from wheat rhizosphere soil. Strain BJ-18(T) was observed to be Gram-positive, facultatively anaerobic, motile and rod-shaped (0.4-0.9 μm × 2.0-2.9 μm). Phylogenetic analysis based on a partial nifH gene sequence and an assay for nitrogenase activity showed its nitrogen-fixing capacity. Phylogenetic analysis based on full 16S rRNA gene sequences suggested that strain BJ-18(T) is a member of the genus Paenibacillus. High similarity of 16S rRNA gene sequence was found between BJ-18(T) and Paenibacillus peoriae DSM 8320(T) (99.05 %), Paenibacillus jamilae DSM 13815(T) (98.86 %), Paenibacillus brasiliensis DSM 13188(T) (98.55 %), Paenibacillus polymyxa DSM 36(T) (98.74 %), Paenibacillus terrae DSM 15891(T) (97.99 %) and Paenibacillus kribbensis JCM 11465(T) (97.92 %), whereas the similarity was below 96.0 % between BJ-18(T) and the other Paenibacillus species.

The DNA G+C content of BJ-18(T) was determined to be 45.8 mol %. The major fatty acid was identified as anteiso-C15:0 (67.1 %). The polar lipids present in strain BJ-18(T) were identified as diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidyl methylethanolamine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol. The phenotypic and genotypic characteristics, and DNA-DNA relatedness data, suggest that BJ-18(T) represents a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus beijingensis sp. nov. (Type strain BJ-18(T)=DSM25425(T)=CGMCC 1.12045(T)) is proposed."

'WG 357' has amber, hard and lustrous grains and is a well adapted high yielding variety of North India whereas 'Tobari 66' is red grained introduction from CIMMYT.The parental F1, F2, B1, B2, biparentals, F3 (parents of biparentals), F3 bulk and F4 bulk generations were studied in order to provide analysis of generations means (Mather 1949; Hayman 1958) and variance component analysis (Kearsay 1965; Perkins and Jinks 1970).There were highly significant differences among the generations for all the characters studied. There were significant differences among the F3 lines as well as among the biparental progenies. Only in case of ear length was the contrast between the two also significant. The mean value of most of the generations arising from the cross fell between the parental range.The three-parameter model failed to account for the variation in generation means in the case of days to heading. This character was concluded to be influenced by linkage and higher order interactions. For the other characters the three parameter model was adequate. For all characters, additive gene effects were most important as compared to dominance gene effects.The analysis of gene action as provided by the generation variance indicated that additive variance was much more pronounced as compared to dominance variance. The heritability was high for days to heading (71 per cent for narrow sense and 80 per cent in broad sense) and plant height (62 and 93 per cent in narrow and broad sense respectively.The implications of the results in breeding programmes have been discussed."

"24454749","abstracttext","MADS-box genes are important transcription factors for plant development, especially floral organogenesis. Brachypodium distachyon is a model for biofuel plants and temperate grasses such as wheat and barley, but a comprehensive analysis of MADS-box family proteins in Brachypodium is still missing. We report here a genome-wide analysis of the MADS-box gene family in Brachypodium distachyon. We identified 57 MADS-box genes and classified them into 32 MIKC(c)-type, 7 MIKC*-type, 9 Mα, 7 Mβ and 2 Mγ MADS-box genes according to their phylogenetic relationships to the Arabidopsis and rice MADS-box genes. Detailed gene structure and motif distribution were then studied. Investigation of their chromosomal localizations revealed that Brachypodium MADS-box genes distributed evenly across five chromosomes. In addition, five pairs of type II MADS-box genes were found on synteny blocks derived from whole genome duplication blocks. We then performed a systematic expression analysis of Brachypodium MADS-box genes in various tissues, particular floral organs. Further detection under salt, drought, and low-temperature conditions showed that some MADS-box genes may also be involved in abiotic stress responses, including type I genes. Comparative studies of MADS-box genes among Brachypodium, rice and Arabidopsis showed that Brachypodium had fewer gene duplication events. Taken together, this work provides useful data for further functional studies of MADS-box genes in Brachypodium distachyon."

"24414619","abstracttext","Chromosome associations at pachytene, diakinesis, and metaphase I were analyzed in haploids of the allotetraploid G.hirsutwn, in the F1 hybrid between G.arboreum (A2) and G. raimondii (D5), and in the doubled hybrid 2(A2D2) in an effort to define more clearly the mechanism responsible for the diploidlike behavior of the natural allotetraploids. The mean number of bivalents per cell at pachytene, diakinesis, and MI were respectively 10.00, 7.40, and 0.80 for the haploids and 11.00, 9.50, and 5.82 for the A2D5 hybrid. The two pachytene means were not significantly different, but the two diakinesis means and the two MI means were significantly different.At early pachytene members of paired chromosomes were not equal in length, but at late pachytene both members were equal in length in most bivalents. It was particularly evident in the unpaired regions that one partner was much thicker or more deeply stained than its counterpart. Since A chromosomes are twice the size, have twice the amount of DNA, and contain greater amounts of repetitive DNA than D chromosomes, it was concluded that the bivalents consisted of A and D homoeologs. In order for the paired homoeologs to attain equality in length at late pachytene, it is presumed that the A chromosomes either started contracting before the D chromosomes or contracted at a faster rate. During the stages following late pachytene, the D chromosomes contracted at a faster rate than the A chromosomes resulting finally in a two-fold difference in the size of the A and D chromosomes at MI. It is assumed that this differential rate of contraction would limit intimate pairing attraction and chiasma formation between homoeologous chromosomes.We concluded that a gene control system analogous to that wheat and oats does not determine the diploidlike meiotic behavior of the natural allotetraploids of Gossypium. This is based on the high frequency of homoelogous pairs at pachytene in the haploids, on the strict homologous pairing in the synthetic 2(A2D5) hybrid, and on the roles repetitive DNA is assumed to have in regulating synapsis and chiasma formation and in structurally differentiating the A and D homoeologs.It was proposed that differences in genome chromosome size may determine whether a gene or non-gene control mechanism is required for regulating homologous pairing in allotetraploids."

"24253161","abstracttext","The effects of a cytokinin (N(6)-benzyladenine, BA) and light on plastogenesis have been studied in detached Cucurbita cotyledons using the key enzyme of photosynthetic CO2 fixation, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBPCase), as an example of a coordinated program of plastid and nucleo-cytoplasmic gene expression. Treatment of etiolated cotyledons with either BA in darkness or in light or light alone results in a marked and correlated stimulation of enzyme activity, quantity and biosynthesis (in-vivo [(14)C]leucine incorporation into immunoprecipitated enzyme protein), indicating an increase of de-novo synthesis under the influence of the two effectors. Cell-free translation of non-polyadenylated (poly(A)(-))RNA in an Escherichia coli system and total RNA in a wheat-germ system likewise demonstrate a light and hormone-dependent increase in the amounts of translatable mRNAs for the large (LS) and small subunits (SS) of RuBPCase (among other polypeptides). Hybridisation of poly(A)(-)RNA with a nick-translated LS gene of spinach RuBPCase reveals also two-to three-fold BA-or light-induced enhancement of LS mRNA content. Indications for stimulation of SS mRNA transcription are derived from inhibitor experiments with cordycepin. We conclude that the observed stimulation of de-novo RuBPCase synthesis by cytokinin and by light can be referred to the level of mRNA transcription, but it remains open whether this is a primary action. Furthermore, our results indicate that the coaction of the two exogenous factors is additive at different steps of RuBPCase formation, indicating independent actions in the causal chain between effector-signal transduction and RuBPCase gene expression."

"24237905","abstracttext_background","The common ancestor of salmonid fishes, including rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), experienced a whole genome duplication between 20 and 100 million years ago, and many of the duplicated genes have been retained in the trout genome. This retention complicates efforts to detect allelic variation in salmonid fishes. Specifically, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection is problematic because nucleotide variation can be found between the duplicate copies (paralogs) of a gene as well as between alleles."
"24237905","abstracttext_results","We present a method of differentiating between allelic and paralogous (gene copy) sequence variants, allowing identification of SNPs in organisms with multiple copies of a gene or set of genes. The basic strategy is to: 1) identify windows of unique cDNA sequences with homology to each other, 2) compare these unique cDNAs if they are not shared between individuals (i.e. the cDNA is homozygous in one individual and homozygous for another cDNA in the other individual), and 3) give a ""SNP score"" value between zero and one to each candidate sequence variant based on six criteria. Using this strategy we were able to detect about seven thousand potential SNPs from the transcriptomes of several clonal lines of rainbow trout. When directly compared to a pre-validated set of SNPs in polyploid wheat, we were also able to estimate the false-positive rate of this strategy as 0 to 28% depending on parameters used."
"24237905","abstracttext_conclusions","This strategy has an advantage over traditional techniques of SNP identification because another dimension of sequencing information is utilized. This method is especially well suited for identifying SNPs in polyploids, both outbred and inbred, but would tend to be conservative for diploid organisms."

Triplicate groups of fish (11.28 g initial body weight) were fed the diet for 45 days at 22 °C, 28 °C or 34 °C. At the end of the trial, final body weight of juvenile at 28 °C (59.12 g) was higher than that of the fish reared at 22 °C (27.13 g) and 34 °C (43.17 g). Feed intake, feed efficiency and protein efficiency ratio were also better at 28 °C. Liver glycogen levels were higher at 28 °C, while plasma glucose levels were higher in the 22 °C group. Significant (P<0.05) effects of water temperature on enzymes activities and gene expression were observed. Hepatic GK activity and mRNA level were higher at 28 °C than at 34 °C. Higher G6Pase and G6PD activity and gene expression were observed at 22 °C. Overall, the data show that juveniles reared at 28 °C exhibited enhanced liver glycolytic capacity.

"26159870","abstracttext","To characterize the structure and expression of a large multigene family of α/β-gliadin genes, 90 individual α/β-gliadin genes harboring a promoter region were identified in the wheat cultivar Chinese Spring. These genes were classified into eleven groups by phylogenetic analysis, and the chromosomes they were derived from were determined. Of these genes, 50 had the basic α/β-gliadin domains and six conserved cysteine residues and 16, 16 and 18 of them were, respectively, located on chromosome 6A, 6B and 6D. Six genes had an additional cysteine residue, suggesting that these α/β-gliadins acquired the property of binding other proteins through intermolecular disulphide bands. Expression of α/β-gliadin genes in developing seeds was measured by quantitative RT-PCR using group-specific primers over 3 years. Expression patterns of these genes on the basis of accumulated temperature were similar among gene groups, whereas expression levels differed for the 3 years. The expression of most α/β-gliadin and other prolamin genes was correlated with the sunshine duration. On the other hand, although all α/β-gliadin genes had a common E-box within the -300 promoter region, some genes showed a particular expression pattern with respect to the sunshine duration, similarly to gene encoding high-molecular weight glutenin subunits and endosperm enzymes. These observations suggested that expression of each α/β-gliadin gene is differentially regulated by multiple regulatory factors."

"26123290","abstracttext_key message","When fused to "" Pr AlSAP "" promoter, transcripts of gusA exhibited similar accumulation patterns in transgenic rice as AlSAP transcripts in A. littoralis. Pr AlSAP can be used for engineering abiotic stress tolerance. We previously showed that ectopic expression of a stress-associated protein gene from Aeluropus littoralis (AlSAP) enhances tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in tobacco, wheat and rice. The ortholog of AlSAP in rice is OsSAP9. Here, we demonstrate that AlSAP transcripts accumulate in Aeleuropus in response to multiple abiotic stresses and at a higher level in roots, while those of OsSAP9 are preferentially induced by cold and heat treatments and accumulate preferentially in leaves of rice. In silico analysis of the AlSAP promoter ""Pr AlSAP "" predicted several cis-acting elements responsible for gene regulation by dehydration, salt, heat, ABA, SA, wounding and tissue-specific expression. The Pr AlSAP promoter was fused to the gusA gene and used to produce transgenic rice plants. Transcripts of gusA exhibited similar accumulation patterns in transgenic rice as AlSAP transcripts in A. littoralis. Indeed, accumulation of gusA transcripts was higher in roots than in leaves and induced by salt, drought, cold and heat treatments. GUS activity was confirmed in roots, coleoptiles, leaves and glumes, but absent in the root cell elongation zone and in dry seeds. A wound treatment strongly induced GUS accumulation in leaves and imbibed seeds. Altogether, these results indicate that the regulatory regions of two ortholog genes ""AlSAP"" and ""OsSAP9"" have diverged in the specificity of the signals promoting their induction, but that the trans-acting elements allowing the correct spatiotemporal regulation and stress induction of Pr AlSAP exist in rice. Therefore, the AlSAP promoter appears to be an interesting candidate for engineering abiotic stress tolerance in cereals."

"25699072","abstracttext","Nostoc is widely known for its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen and the establishment of symbiotic relationship with a wide range of plants from various taxonomic groups. Several strains of Nostoc produce phytohormones that promote growth of its plant partners. Nostoc OS-1 was therefore selected for study because of the presence of putative ipdC gene that encodes a key enzyme to produce Indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). The results indicated that both cellular and released IAA was found high with increasing incubation time and reached to a peak value (i.e., 21 pmol mg(-1)ch-a) on the third week as determined by UPLC-ESI-MS/MS. Also the Nostoc OS-1 strain efficiently colonized the roots and promoted the growth of rice as well as wheat under axenic conditions and induced ipdC gene that suggested the possible involvement of IAA in these phenotypes. To confirm the impact of IAA on root colonization efficiency and plant promoting phenotypes of Nostoc OS-1, an ipdC knockout mutant was generated by homologous recombinant method. The amount of releasing IAA, in vitro growth, root colonization, and plant promoting efficiency of the ipdC knockout mutant was observed significantly lower than wild type strain under axenic conditions. Importantly, these phenotypes were restored to wild-type levels when the ipdC knockout mutant was complemented with wild type ipdC gene. These results together suggested that ipdC and/or synthesized IAA of Nostoc OS-1 is required for its efficient root colonization and plant promoting activity."

"25311582","abstracttext_results","The complete sequences of MYB80 genes from the Brassica. napus (A gene), B. juncea (A gene), B. oleracea (C gene) and the two orthologs from cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) were determined.

The cotton MYB80 protein can fully restore fertility of the atmyb80 mutant, while removal of the 44 amino acid sequence abolishes its function. Two conserved MYB cis-elements in the AtMYB80 promoter are required for downregulation of MYB80 expression in anthers, apparently via negative auto-regulation. In cotton, tapetal degradation occurs at a slightly earlier stage of anther development than in Arabidopsis, consistent with an earlier increase and subsequent downregulation in GhMYB80 expression. The MYB80 homologs fused with the EAR repressor motif have been shown to induce male sterility in Arabidopsis. Constructs were designed to maximize the level of male sterility."

"25173486","articletitle","Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L) flag leaf transcriptomes reveal molecular signatures of leaf development, senescence, and mineral dynamics."
"25173486","abstracttext","Switchgrass flag leaves can be expected to be a source of carbon to the plant, and its senescence is likely to impact the remobilization of nutrients from the shoots to the rhizomes. However, many genes have not been assigned a function in specific stages of leaf development. Here, we characterized gene expression in flag leaves over their development. By merging changes in leaf chlorophyll and the expression of genes for chlorophyll biosynthesis and degradation, a four-phase molecular roadmap for switchgrass flag leaf ontogeny was developed. Genes associated with early leaf development were up-regulated in phase 1. Phase 2 leaves had increased expression of genes for chlorophyll biosynthesis and those needed for full leaf function. Phase 3 coincided with the most active phase for leaf C and N assimilation. Phase 4 was associated with the onset of senescence, as observed by declining leaf chlorophyll content, a significant up-regulation in transcripts coding for enzymes involved with chlorophyll degradation, and in a large number of senescence-associated genes. Of considerable interest were switchgrass NAC transcription factors with significantly higher expression in senescing flag leaves. Two of these transcription factors were closely related to a wheat NAC gene that impacts mineral remobilization. The third switchgrass NAC factor was orthologous to an Arabidopsis gene with a known role in leaf senescence. Other genes coding for nitrogen and mineral utilization, including ureide, ammonium, nitrate, and molybdenum transporters, shared expression profiles that were significantly co-regulated with the expression profiles of the three NAC transcription factors. These data provide a good starting point to link shoot senescence to the onset of dormancy in field-grown switchgrass."

"25076837","abstracttext","Heading of cereals is determined by complex genetic and environmental factors in which genes responsible for vernalization and photoperiod sensitivity play a decisive role. Our aim was to use diagnostic molecular markers to determine the main allele types in VRN - A1 , VRN - B1 , VRN - D1 , PPD - B1 and PPD - D1 in a worldwide wheat collection of 683 genotypes and to investigate the effect of these alleles on heading in the field. The dominant VRN - A1 , VRN - B1 and VRN - D1 alleles were present at a low frequency. The PPD - D1a photoperiod-insensitive allele was carried by 57 % of the cultivars and was most frequent in Asian and European cultivars. The PPD - B1 photoperiod-insensitive allele was carried by 22 % of the genotypes from Asia, America and Europe. Nine versions of the PPD - B1 -insensitive allele were identified based on gene copy number and intercopy structure. The allele compositions in PPD - D1 , PPD - B1 and VRN - D1 significantly influenced heading and together explained 37.5 % of the phenotypic variance. The role of gene model increased to 39.1 % when PPD - B1 intercopy structure was taken into account instead of overall PPD - B1 type (sensitive vs. insensitive). As a single component, PPD - D1 had the most important role (28.0 % of the phenotypic variance), followed by PPD - B1 (12.3 % for PPD - B1 _overall, and 15.1 % for PPD - B1 _intercopy) and VRN - D1 (2.2 %). Significant gene interactions were identified between the marker alleles within PPD - B1 and between VRN - D1 and the two PPD1 genes. The earliest heading genotypes were those with the photoperiod-insensitive allele in PPD - D1 and PPD - B1 , and with the spring allele for VRN - D1 and the winter alleles for VRN - A1 and VRN - B1 . This combination could only be detected in genotypes from Southern Europe and Asia. Late-heading genotypes had the sensitivity alleles for both PPD1 genes, regardless of the allelic composition of the VRN1 genes. There was a 10-day difference in heading between the earliest and latest groups under field conditions."
"25400203","articletitle","A novel approach to identify genes that determine grain protein deviation in cereals."
"25400203","abstracttext","Grain yield and protein content were determined for six wheat cultivars grown over 3 years at multiple sites and at multiple nitrogen (N) fertilizer inputs. Although grain protein content was negatively correlated with yield, some grain samples had higher protein contents than expected based on their yields, a trait referred to as grain protein deviation (GPD). We used novel statistical approaches to identify gene transcripts significantly related to GPD across environments. The yield and protein content were initially adjusted for nitrogen fertilizer inputs and then adjusted for yield (to remove the negative correlation with protein content), resulting in a parameter termed corrected GPD. Significant genetic variation in corrected GPD was observed for six cultivars grown over a range of environmental conditions (a total of 584 samples). Gene transcript profiles were determined in a subset of 161 samples of developing grain to identify transcripts contributing to GPD. Principal component analysis (PCA), analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means of scores regression (MSR) were used to identify individual principal components (PCs) correlating with GPD alone. Scores of the selected PCs, which were significantly related to GPD and protein content but not to the yield and significantly affected by cultivar, were identified as reflecting a multivariate pattern of gene expression related to genetic variation in GPD. Transcripts with consistent variation along the selected PCs were identified by an approach hereby called one-block means of scores regression (one-block MSR)."

"25416252","abstracttext","Genetic engineering of taro is an effective method to improve taro quality and the resistance to various diseases of taro. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of taro is more efficient than the particle bombardment transformation method based on current research. The development of a regeneration system starting from taro shoot tip explants could produce dasheen mosaic virus (DsMV)-free plantlets. Highly regenerative calluses could be developed from DsMV-free, in vitro plantlets on the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 2 mg/L BA and 1 mg/L NAA (M5 medium). The Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation method is reported in this chapter. The highly regenerative calluses were selected and cocultivated with the Agrobacterium strain EHA105 harboring the binary vector PBI121 with either a rice chitinase gene chi11 or a wheat oxalate oxidase gene gf2.8. After cocultivation for 3-4 days, these calluses were transferred to selection medium (M5 medium) containing 50 mg/L Geneticin G418 and grown for 3 months in the dark. Transgenic shoot lines could be induced and selected on the MS medium containing 4 mg/L BA (M15 medium) and 50 mg/L Geneticin G418 for 3 months further in the light. Molecular analyses are used to confirm the stable transformation and expression of the disease resistance gene chi11 or gf2.8. Pathologic bioassays could be used to demonstrate whether the transgenic plants had increased disease resistance to taro pathogens Sclerotium rolfsii or Phytophthora colocasiae."

"26089830","abstracttext","Plants have evolved complex regulatory mechanisms to control a multi-layered defense response to microbial attack. Both temporal and spatial gene expression are tightly regulated in response to pathogen ingress, modulating both positive and negative control of defense. BLUFENSINs, small knottin-like peptides in barley, wheat, and rice, are highly induced by attack from fungal pathogens, in particular, the obligate biotrophic fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), causal agent of barley powdery mildew. Previous research indicated that Blufensin1 (Bln1) functions as a negative regulator of basal defense mechanisms. In the current report, we show that BLN1 and BLN2 can both be secreted to the apoplast and Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-mediated overexpression of Bln2 increases susceptibility of barley to Bgh. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays signify that BLN1 and BLN2 can interact with each other, and with calmodulin. We then used BSMV-induced gene silencing to knock down Bln1, followed by Barley1 GeneChip transcriptome analysis, to identify additional host genes influenced by Bln1. Analysis of differential expression revealed a gene set enriched for those encoding proteins annotated to nuclear import and the secretory pathway, particularly Importin α1-b and Sec61 γ subunits. Further functional analysis of these two affected genes showed that when silenced, they also reduced susceptibility to Bgh. Taken together, we postulate that Bln1 is co-opted by Bgh to facilitate transport of disease-related host proteins or effectors, influencing the establishment of Bgh compatibility on its barley host."

"26080472","abstracttext","The causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch, Mycosphaerella graminicola, is currently the most frequently reported pathogen on wheat crops worldwide. The populations of this fungus were previously studied in Tunisia using microsatellite markers, but no information is available on the mitochondrial (mt) genetic structure of the fungus in this country. The objective of this study was thus to examine the genetic diversity and population structure of M. graminicola in Tunisia using mtDNA markers. A set 105 monoconidial isolates of the pathogen were sampled in 2012 from four geographical locations in Tunisia (Bizerte, Béja, Kef and Jendouba) and assessed for diversity and polymorphism of three mtDNA sequences (Mg1: 388 bp, Mg2: 570 bp, Mg3: 929 bp) using PCR-RFLP-SSCP. Mg2 and Mg3 were the more polymorphic sequences with 12 and 9 observed alleles, respectively, while Mg1 was the less polymorphic one with only two alleles. Data analyses revealed a moderate mt gene diversity and a low mt haplotype diversity within the population. Further analyses showed a low population differentiation (G(ST) = 0.16) and a moderate gene flow (Nm = 2.61) within the population. Both UPGMA and Bayesian clustering methods confirmed this lack of mt genetic structuration. Our study allowed us to characterize for the first time mt genetic structure of M. graminicola in Tunisia and to report a moderate mt gene diversity, a low mt genotype diversity and a lack of mt genetic structure of the parasite in this country."

"25512333","abstracttext","Pyroglutamyl leucine (pyroGlu-Leu), which is a peptide isolated from wheat gluten hydrolysate, has been reported to be a hepatoprotective compound in acute liver failure. In inflamed liver, proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin (IL)-1β and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α stimulate the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). Excess production of nitric oxide (NO) by iNOS is an inflammatory biomarker in liver injury. We examined proinflammatory cytokine-stimulated hepatocytes as a simple ""in vitro inflammation model"" to determine liver protective effects of pyroGlu-Leu and its mechanisms of action. We hypothesized that pyroGlu-Leu inhibits the induction of iNOS gene expression, resulting in the attenuation of hepatic inflammation. Hepatocytes were isolated from rats by collagenase perfusion and cultured. Primary cultured cells were treated with IL-1β in the presence or absence of pyroGlu-Leu. The induction of iNOS and its signaling pathway were analyzed. IL-1β stimulated the enhancement of NO production in hepatocytes and this effect was inhibited by pyroGlu-Leu. pyroGlu-Leu decreased the expression of iNOS protein and its mRNA. Transfection experiments with iNOS-luciferase constructs revealed that pyroGlu-Leu inhibited both of iNOS promoter transactivation and its mRNA stabilization. pyroGlu-Leu also decreased the expression of an iNOS gene antisense transcript, which is involved in iNOS mRNA stability. However, pyroGlu-Leu had no effects on IκB degradation and NF-κB activation. Results demonstrate that pyroGlu-Leu inhibited the induction of iNOS gene expression at transcriptional and post-transcriptional steps through IκB/NF-κB-independent pathway, leading to the prevention of NO production. pyroGlu-Leu may have therapeutic potential for liver injury through the suppression of iNOS."

"26494729","abstracttext","Genetic modification of shoot and root morphology has potential to improve water and nutrient uptake of wheat crops in rainfed environments. Near-isogenic lines (NILs) varying for a tillering inhibition (tin) gene and representing multiple genetic backgrounds were phenotyped in contrasting, controlled environments for shoot and root growth. Leaf area, shoot and root biomass were similar until tillering, whereupon reduced tillering in tin-containing NILs produced reductions of up to 60% in total leaf area and biomass, and increases in total root length of up to 120% and root biomass to 145%. Together, the root-to-shoot ratio increased two-fold with the tin gene. The influence of tin on shoot and root growth was greatest in the cv. Banks genetic background, particularly in the biculm-selected NIL, and was typically strongest in cooler environments. A separate de-tillering study confirmed greater root-to-shoot ratios with regular tiller removal in non-tin-containing genotypes. In validating these observations in a rainfed field study, the tin allele had a negligible effect on seedling growth but was associated with significantly (P<0.05) reduced tiller number (-37%), leaf area index (-26%), and spike number (-35%) to reduce plant biomass (-19%) at anthesis. Root biomass, root-to-shoot ratio at early stem elongation, and root depth at maturity were all increased in tin-containing NILs. Soil water use was slowed in tin-containing NILs, resulting in greater water availability, greater stomatal conductance, cooler canopy temperatures, and maintenance of green leaf area during grain-filling. Together these effects contributed to increases in harvest index and grain yield. In both the controlled and field environments, the tin gene was commonly associated with increased root length and biomass, but the significant influence of genetic background and environment suggests careful assessment of tin-containing progeny in selection for genotypic increases in root growth."

"26456718","abstracttext","Molecular mechanisms underlying the responses to environmental factors, such as nitrogen, carbon and pH, involve components that regulate the production of secondary metabolites, including mycotoxins. In this study, we identified and characterized a gene in the FGSG_02083 locus, designated as FgArt1, which was predicted to encode a Zn(II)2 Cys6 zinc finger transcription factor. An FgArt1 deletion mutant of Fusarium graminearum exhibited impaired starch hydrolysis as a result of significantly reduced α-amylase gene expression. The deletion strain was unable to produce trichothecenes and exhibited low Tri5 and Tri6 expression levels, whereas the complemented strain showed a similar ability to produce trichothecenes as the wild-type strain. In addition, FgArt1 deletion resulted in impairment of germination in starch liquid medium and reduced pathogenicity on flowering wheat heads. To investigate the roles of the FgArt1 homologue in F. verticillioides, we deleted the FVEG_02083 gene, and the resulting strain showed defects in starch hydrolysis, similar to the FgArt1 deletion strain, and produced no detectable level of fumonisin B1 . Fum1 and Fum12 expression levels were undetectable in the deletion strain. However, when the FvArt1-deleted F. verticillioides strain was complemented with FgArt1, the resulting strain was unable to recover the production of fumonisin B1 , although FgArt1 expression and starch hydrolysis were induced. Thus, our results suggest that there are different regulatory pathways governed by each ART1 transcription factor in trichothecene and fumonisin biosynthesis. Taken together, we suggest that ART1 plays an important role in both trichothecene and fumonisin biosynthesis by the regulation of genes involved in starch hydrolysis."

"27142817","abstracttext_background","Plant cell wall (PCW) polysaccharides and especially xylans constitute an important part of human diet. Xylans are not degraded by human digestive enzymes in the upper digestive tract and therefore reach the colon where they are subjected to extensive degradation by some members of the symbiotic microbiota. Xylanolytic bacteria are the first degraders of these complex polysaccharides and they release breakdown products that can have beneficial effects on human health. In order to understand better how these bacteria metabolize xylans in the colon, this study was undertaken to investigate xylan breakdown by the prominent human gut symbiont Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1A(T)."

Proteomic analyses supported the up-regulation of several genes belonging to PUL 43 and showed the important over-production of a CBM4-containing GH10 endo-xylanase. We also show that PUL 43 is organized in two operons and that the knockout of the PUL 43 sensor/regulator HTCS gene blocked the growth of the mutant on insoluble OSX and soluble wheat arabinoxylan (WAX). The mutation not only repressed gene expression in the PUL 43 operons but also repressed gene expression in rPUL 70."
"27142817","abstracttext_conclusion","This study shows that xylan degradation by B. xylanisolvens XB1A(T) is orchestrated by one PUL and one PUL remnant that are linked at the transcriptional level. Coupled to studies on other xylanolytic Bacteroides species, our data emphasize the importance of one peculiar CBM4-containing GH10 endo-xylanase in xylan breakdown and that this modular enzyme may be used as a functional marker of xylan degradation in the human gut. Our results also suggest that B. xylanisolvens XB1A(T) has specialized in the degradation of xylans of low complexity. This functional feature may provide a niche to all xylanolytic bacteria harboring similar PULs. Further functional and ecological studies on fibrolytic Bacteroides species are needed to better understand their role in dietary fiber degradation and their impact on intestinal health."

"27136161","abstracttext","Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) both mediate soil nitrification and may have specialized niches in the soil. Little is understood of how these microorganisms are affected by long-term crop rotation and tillage practices. In this study, we assessed abundance and gene expression of AOB and AOA under two contrasting crop rotations and tillage regimes at a 30-yr-old long-term experiment on a Canadian silt loam soil. Continuous corn ( L.) (CC) was compared with a corn-corn-soybean [ (L.) Merr.]-winter wheat ( L.) rotation under-seeded with red clover ( L.) (RC), with conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) as subplot treatments. Soil sampling was performed during the first corn year at four time points throughout the 2010 season and at three discrete depths (0-5, 5-15, and 15-30 cm). Overall, AOA abundance was found to be more than 10 times that of AOB, although AOA transcriptional activity was below detectable levels across all treatments. Crop rotation had a marginally significant effect on AOB abundance, with 1.3 times as many gene copies under the simpler CC rotation than under the more diverse RC rotation. More pronounced effects of depth on AOB abundance and gene expression were observed under NT versus CT management, and NT supported higher abundances of total archaea and AOA than CT across the growing season. We suggest that AOB may be more functionally important than AOA in this high-input agricultural soil but that NT management can promote enhanced soil archaeal populations."

"27317908","abstracttext","Gibberellin (GA) is essential for determining plant height. Alteration of GA content or GA signaling results in a dwarf or slender phenotype. Here, we characterized a novel wheat mutant, quick development (qd), in which GA regulates stem elongation but does not affect mature plant height. qd and wild-type plants did not exhibit phenotypic differences at the seedling stage. From jointing to heading stage, qd plants were taller than wild-type plants due to elongated cells. However, wild-type and qd plants were the same height at heading. Unlike wild-type plants, qd plants were sensitive to exogenous GA due to mutation of Rht-B1. With continuous GA stimulation, qd seedlings and adult plants were taller than wild-type. Thus, the GA content of qd plants might differ from that of wild-type during the growth process. Analysis of GA biosynthetic gene expression verified this hypothesis and showed that TaKAO, which is involved in catalyzing the early steps of GA biosynthesis, was differentially expressed in qd plants compared with wild-type. The bioactive GA associated gene TaGA20ox was downregulated in qd plants during the late growth stages. Measurements of endogenous GA content were consistent with the gene-expression analysis results. Consistent with the GA content variation, the first three basal internodes were longer and the last two internodes were shorter in qd than in wild-type plants. The qd mutant might be useful in dissecting the mechanism by which GA regulates stem-growing process, and it may be serve as a GA responsive semi-dwarf germplasm in breeding programs."

"27210549","abstracttext","Rose rosette virus (RRV), belonging to the genus Emaravirus, is a highly destructive pathogen that causes rose rosette disease. The disease is a major concern for the rose industry in the U.S. due to the lack of highly sensitive methods for early detection of RRV. This is critical, as early identification of the infected plants and eradication is necessary in minimizing the risks associated with the spread of the disease. A highly reliable, specific and sensitive detection assay is thus required to test and confirm the presence of RRV in suspected plant samples. In this study a TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of RRV from infected roses, utilizing multiple gene targets. Four pairs of primers and probes; two of them (RRV_2-1 and RRV_2-2) based on the consensus sequences of the glycoprotein gene (RNA2) and the other two (RRV_3-2 and RRV_3-5) based on the nucleocapsid gene (RNA3) were designed. The specificity of the primers and probes was evaluated against other representative viruses infecting roses, belonging to the genera Alfamovirus, Cucumovirus, Ilarvirus, Nepovirus, Tobamovirus, and Tospovirus and one Emaravirus (Wheat mosaic virus). Dilution assays using the in vitro transcripts (spiked with total RNA from healthy plants, and non-spiked) showed that all the primers and probes are highly sensitive in consistently detecting RRV with a detection limit of 1 fg. Testing of the infected plants over a period of time (three times in monthly intervals) indicated high reproducibility, with the primer/probe RRV_3-5 showing 100% positive detection, while RRV_2-1, RRV_2-2 and RRV_3-2 showed 90% positive detection. The developed real-time RT-PCR assay is reliable, highly sensitive, and can be easily used in diagnostic laboratories for testing and confirmation of RRV."

"27481351","abstracttext","α-amylase is an important enzyme involved in starch degradation to provide energy to the germinating seedling. The present study was conducted to reveal structural and functional evolution of this gene among higher plants. Discounting polyploidy, most plant species showed only a single copy of the gene making multiple isoforms in different tissues and developmental stages. Genomic length of the gene ranged from 1472 bp in wheat to 2369 bp in soybean, and the size variation was mainly due to differences in the number and size of introns. In spite of this variation, the intron phase distribution and insertion sites were mostly conserved. The predicted protein size ranged from 414 amino acid (aa) in soybean to 449aa in Brachypodium. Overall, the protein sequence similarity among orthologs ranged from 56.4 to 97.4 %. Key motifs and domains along with their relative distances were conserved among plants although several species, genera, and class specific motifs were identified. The glycosyl hydrolase superfamily domain length varied from 342aa in soybean to 384aa in maize and sorghum while length of the C-terminal β-sheet domain was highly conserved with 61aa in all monocots and Arabidopsis but was 59aa in soybean and Medicago. Compared to rice, 3D structure of the proteins showed 89.8 to 91.3 % similarity among the monocots and 72.7 to 75.8 % among the dicots. Sequence and relative location of the five key aa required for the ligand binding were highly conserved in all species except rice."

"28712501","abstracttext","Polyploid crops make up a significant portion of the major food and fiber crops of the world and include wheat, potato, cotton, apple, peanut, citrus, and brassica oilseeds such as rape, canola, and Camelina. The presence of three sets of chromosomes in triploids, four sets in tetraploids, and six sets in hexaploids present significant challenges to conventional plant breeding and, potentially, to efficient use of rapidly emerging gene and genome-editing systems such as zinc finger nucleases, single-stranded oligonucleotides, TALE effector nucleases, and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9). However, recent studies with each of these techniques in several polyploid crops have demonstrated facile editing of some or all of the genes targeted for modification on homeologous chromosomes. These modifications have allowed improvements in food nutrition, seed oil composition, disease resistance, weed protection, plant breeding procedures, and food safety. Plants and plant products exhibiting useful new traits created through gene editing but lacking foreign DNA may face reduced regulatory restrictions. Such plants can be obtained either by simply selecting for null segregants that have lost their editing transgenes during plant breeding or, even more attractively, by delivery of biodegradable Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein complexes (i.e., no DNA) into plant cells where they are expressed only transiently but allow for efficient gene editing-a system that has been recently demonstrated in at least two polyploid crops. Such systems that create precise mutations but leave no transgene footprint hold potential promise for assisting with the elimination or great diminution of regulatory processes that presently burden approvals of conventional transgenic crops."

The GtxynA1 gene was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The resulting endo-xylanase (termed GtXynA1) was purified to homogeneity and showed activity between 40 °C and 80 °C, with an optimum activity at 60 °C, while being active between pH 3.0 to 9.0 with an optimum at pH 6.0.

To determine its mode of action, we compared the hydrolysis products generated by GtXynA1 with those from the well-characterized GH10 endo-xylanase produced from Aspergillus awamori (AaXynA).

"27702901","abstracttext","Disease-resistance genes encoding intracellular nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs) are key components of the plant innate immune system and typically detect the presence of isolate-specific avirulence (AVR) effectors from pathogens. NLR genes define the fastest-evolving gene family of flowering plants and are often arranged in gene clusters containing multiple paralogs, contributing to copy number and allele-specific NLR variation within a host species. Barley mildew resistance locus a (Mla) has been subject to extensive functional diversification, resulting in allelic resistance specificities each recognizing a cognate, but largely unidentified, AVR a gene of the powdery mildew fungus, Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh). We applied a transcriptome-wide association study among 17 Bgh isolates containing different AVR a genes and identified AVR a1 and AVR a13 , encoding candidate-secreted effectors recognized by Mla1 and Mla13 alleles, respectively. Transient expression of the effector genes in barley leaves or protoplasts was sufficient to trigger Mla1 or Mla13 allele-specific cell death, a hallmark of NLR receptor-mediated immunity. AVR a1 and AVR a13 are phylogenetically unrelated, demonstrating that certain allelic MLA receptors evolved to recognize sequence-unrelated effectors. They are ancient effectors because corresponding loci are present in wheat powdery mildew. AVR A1 recognition by barley MLA1 is retained in transgenic Arabidopsis, indicating that AVR A1 directly binds MLA1 or that its recognition involves an evolutionarily conserved host target of AVR A1 Furthermore, analysis of transcriptome-wide sequence variation among the Bgh isolates provides evidence for Bgh population structure that is partially linked to geographic isolation."

The crop has proven its adaptability in harsh conditions and has shown resilience to climate change. The adaptability traits of finger millet have shown the advantage over major cereal grains under stress conditions, revealing it as a storehouse of important genomic resources for crop improvement. Although new technologies for genomic studies are now available, progress in identifying and tapping these important alleles or genes is lacking. RAPDs were the default choice for genetic diversity studies in the crop until the last decade, but the subsequent development of SSRs and comparative genomics paved the way for the marker assisted selection in finger millet. Resistance gene homologs from NBS-LRR region of finger millet for blast and sequence variants for nutritional traits from other cereals have been developed and used invariably. Population structure analysis studies exhibit 2-4 sub-populations in the finger millet gene pool with separate grouping of Indian and exotic genotypes.

"27888547","abstracttext","We report on a whole-genome draft sequence of rye (Secale cereale L.). Rye is a diploid Triticeae species closely related to wheat and barley, and an important crop for food and feed in Central and Eastern Europe. Through whole-genome shotgun sequencing of the 7.9-Gbp genome of the winter rye inbred line Lo7 we obtained a de novo assembly represented by 1.29 million scaffolds covering a total length of 2.8 Gbp. Our reference sequence represents nearly the entire low-copy portion of the rye genome. This genome assembly was used to predict 27 784 rye gene models based on homology to sequenced grass genomes. Through resequencing of 10 rye inbred lines and one accession of the wild relative S. vavilovii, we discovered more than 90 million single nucleotide variants and short insertions/deletions in the rye genome. From these variants, we developed the high-density Rye600k genotyping array with 600 843 markers, which enabled anchoring the sequence contigs along a high-density genetic map and establishing a synteny-based virtual gene order. Genotyping data were used to characterize the diversity of rye breeding pools and genetic resources, and to obtain a genome-wide map of selection signals differentiating the divergent gene pools. This rye whole-genome sequence closes a gap in Triticeae genome research, and will be highly valuable for comparative genomics, functional studies and genome-based breeding in rye."

"29325559","abstracttext_background","Structural variation contributes substantially to polymorphism within species. Chromosomal rearrangements that impact genes can lead to functional variation among individuals and influence the expression of phenotypic traits. Genomes of fungal pathogens show substantial chromosomal polymorphism that can drive virulence evolution on host plants. Assessing the adaptive significance of structural variation is challenging, because most studies rely on inferences based on a single reference genome sequence."
"29325559","abstracttext_results","We constructed and analyzed the pangenome of Zymoseptoria tritici, a major pathogen of wheat that evolved host specialization by chromosomal rearrangements and gene deletions. We used single-molecule real-time sequencing and high-density genetic maps to assemble multiple genomes. We annotated the gene space based on transcriptomics data that covered the infection life cycle of each strain. Based on a total of five telomere-to-telomere genomes, we constructed a pangenome for the species and identified a core set of 9149 genes. However, an additional 6600 genes were exclusive to a subset of the isolates. The substantial accessory genome encoded on average fewer expressed genes but a larger fraction of the candidate effector genes that may interact with the host during infection. We expanded our analyses of the pangenome to a worldwide collection of 123 isolates of the same species. We confirmed that accessory genes were indeed more likely to show deletion polymorphisms and loss-of-function mutations compared to core genes."

"29354367","abstracttext","Although many studies on low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) function have been reported, a comprehensive comparison between specific genes and their protein product is still lacking. This study aimed to link the 43 genes isolated from the Korean wheat variety ""Jokyoung"" in the authors' previous study to their protein products. Proteins were separated using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DGE) and identified by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) at the gene haplotype level. Using MS/MS analysis of 17 protein spots, two spots were identified in the Glu - A3 locus and the corresponding haplotype was  GluA3 - 13 ( Glu - A3c ). Six spots were identified in the Glu - B3 locus and the corresponding haplotypes were GluB3 - 33 and GluB3 - 43 ( Glu - B3h ). Eight spots were identified in the Glu - D3 locus and the corresponding haplotypes were GluD3 - 11 , GluD3 - 21 , GluD3 - 31 , GluD3 - 5 , and GluD3 - 6 ( Glu - D3a ), and one spot was contaminated with gamma gliadin. Phylogenetic analysis and alignment of nucleotide and amino acid sequences assigned 35 of the 43 genes to seven haplotypes: GluA3 - 13 , GluB3 - 43 , GluD3 - 11 , GluD3 - 21 , GluD3 - 31 , GluD3 - 42 , and GluD3 - 5 . Taken together, except for GluB3 - 33 and GluD3 - 6 , which were not isolated, linking of each gene to the corresponding protein products at the gene haplotype level was accomplished using proteomic tools and phylogenetic analysis."
"28132080","articletitle","FvSNF1, the sucrose non-fermenting protein kinase gene of Fusarium virguliforme, is required for cell-wall-degrading enzymes expression and sudden death syndrome development in soybean."
"28132080","abstracttext","Fusarium virguliforme is a soil-borne pathogenic fungus that causes sudden death syndrome (SDS) in soybean. Its pathogenicity is believed to require the activity of cell-wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs). The sucrose non-fermenting protein kinase 1 gene (SNF1) is a key component of the glucose de-repression pathway in yeast, and a regulator of gene expression for CWDEs in some plant pathogenic fungi. To elucidate the functional role of the SNF1 homolog in F. virguliforme, FvSNF1 was disrupted using a split-marker strategy. Disruption of FvSNF1 in F. virguliforme abolishes galactose utilization and causes poor growth on xylose, arabinose and sucrose. However, the resulting Fvsnf1 mutant grew similar to wild-type and ectopic transformants on glucose, fructose, maltose, or pectin as the main source of carbon. The Fvsnf1 mutant displayed no expression of the gene-encoding galactose oxidase (GAO), a secretory enzyme that catalyzes oxidation of D-galactose. It also exhibited a significant reduction in the expression of several CWDE-coding genes in contrast to the wild-type strain. Greenhouse pathogenicity assays revealed that the Fvsnf1 mutant was severely impaired in its ability to cause SDS on challenged soybean plants. Microscopy and microtome studies on infected roots showed that the Fvsnf1 mutant was defective in colonizing vascular tissue of infected plants. Cross and longitudinal sections of infected roots stained with fluorescein-labeled wheat germ agglutinin and Congo red showed that the Fvsnf1 mutant failed to colonize the xylem vessels and phloem tissue at later stages of infection. Quantification of the fungal biomass in inoculated roots further confirmed a reduced colonization of roots by the Fvsnf1 mutant when compared to the wild type. These findings suggest that FvSNF1 regulates the expression of CWDEs in F. virguliforme, thus affecting the virulence of the fungus on soybean."

"28322011","abstracttext","Fusarium culmorum is a soil-borne fungal pathogen which causes foot and root rot and Fusarium head blight on small-grain cereals, in particular wheat and barley. It causes significant yield and quality losses and results in the contamination of kernels with type B trichothecene mycotoxins. Our knowledge of the pathogenicity factors of this fungus is still limited. A transposon tagging approach based on the mimp1/impala double-component system has allowed us to select a mutant altered in multiple metabolic and morphological processes, trichothecene production and virulence. The flanking regions of mimp1 were used to seek homologies in the F. culmorum genome, and revealed that mimp1 had reinserted within the last exon of a gene encoding a hypothetical protein of 318 amino acids which contains a ROGDI-like leucine zipper domain, supposedly playing a protein-protein interaction or regulatory role. By functional complementation and bioinformatic analysis, we characterized the gene as the yeast Rav2 homologue, confirming the high level of divergence in multicellular fungi. Deletion of FcRav2 or its orthologous gene in F. graminearum highlighted its ability to influence a number of functions, including virulence, trichothecene type B biosynthesis, resistance to azoles and resistance to osmotic and oxidative stress. Our results indicate that the FcRav2 protein (and possibly the RAVE complex as a whole) may become a suitable target for new antifungal drug development or the plant-mediated resistance response in filamentous fungi of agricultural interest."

"28745102","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, and stem rust, caused by P. graminis f. sp. tritici, are important diseases of durum wheat. This study determined the inheritance and genomic locations of leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes to P. triticina race BBBQJ and stem rust resistance (Sr) genes to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK in durum accessions. Eight leaf-rust-resistant genotypes were used to develop biparental populations. Accessions PI 192051 and PI 534304 were also resistant to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK. The resulting progenies were phenotyped for leaf rust and stem rust response at seedling stage. The Lr and Sr genes were mapped in five populations using single-nucleotide polymorphisms and bulked segregant analysis. Five leaf-rust-resistant genotypes carried single dominant Lr genes whereas, in the remaining accessions, there was deviation from the expected segregation ratio of a single dominant Lr gene. Seven genotypes carried Lr genes different from those previously characterized in durum. The single dominant Lr genes in PI 209274, PI 244061, PI387263, and PI 313096 were mapped to chromosome arms 6BS, 2BS, 6BL, and 6BS, respectively. The Sr gene in PI 534304 mapped to 6AL and is most likely Sr13, while the Sr gene in PI 192051 could be uncharacterized in durum."

"29089018","abstracttext_background","Grass powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis, Ascomycota) is a major pathogen of cereal crops and has become a model organism for obligate biotrophic fungal pathogens of plants. The sequenced genomes of two formae speciales (ff.spp.), B.g. hordei and B.g. tritici (pathogens of barley and wheat), were found to be enriched in candidate effector genes (CEGs). Similar to other filamentous pathogens, CEGs in B. graminis are under positive selection. Additionally, effectors are more likely to have presence-absence polymorphisms than other genes among different strains."
"29089018","abstracttext_results","Here we identified effectors in the genomes of three additional host-specific lineages of B. graminis (B.g. poae, B.g. avenae and B.g. infecting Lolium) which diverged between 24 and 5 million years ago (Mya). We found that most CEGs in B. graminis are clustered in families and that most families are present in both reference genomes (B.g. hordei and B.g. tritici) and in the genomes of all three newly annotated lineages. We identified conserved protein domains including a novel lipid binding domain. The phylogenetic analysis showed that frequent gene duplications and losses shaped the diversity of the effector repertoires of the different lineages through their evolutionary history. We observed several lineage-specific expansions where large clades of CEGs originated in only one lineage from a single gene through repeated gene duplications. When we applied a birth-death model we found that the turnover rate (the rate at which genes are deleted and duplicated) of CEG families is much higher than for non-CEG families. The analysis of genomic context revealed that the immediate surroundings of CEGs are enriched in transposable elements (TE) which could play a role in the duplication and deletion of CEGs."
"29089018","abstracttext_conclusions","The CEG repertoires of related pathogens diverged dramatically in short evolutionary times because of rapid turnover and of positive selection fixing non-synonymous mutations. While signatures of positive selection on effector sequences are the expected outcome of the evolutionary ""arms race"" between pathogen and plant immune system, it is more difficult to infer the mechanisms and evolutionary forces that maintained an extreme turnover rate in CEG families of B. graminis for several millions of years."

"29074072","abstracttext","White grain disorder (WGD) is a recently emerged wheat disease in Australia caused by three Botryosphaeriaceae fungi, from the genus Eutiarosporella. These species are E. tritici-australis, E. darliae, and E. pseudodarliae. Characterisation of the mating type genes for the WGD-species show that the genome sequence of a single E. darliae and E. pseudodarliae isolate both harbour MAT1-2-1 and MAT1-1-1, which suggests that these species are homothallic. However, unlike most other characterised mating-type loci from other homothallic Dothideomycetes, these species' MAT1-1-1 are located at a separate locus, inserted within the coding region of another gene. The sequenced strain of E. tritici-australis analysed did not harbour MAT1-1-1. Including the sequenced strain, we screened the mating type genes present in 16 E. tritici-australis individuals isolated from infected grain from fields in South Australia. Of these 16, 11 harbour MAT1-1-1 and the other five harbour MAT1-2-1. The genome of a MAT1-1-1 harbouring isolate was re-sequenced, which demonstrated that MAT1-1-1 was present at the MAT locus. We examined non-coding DNA surrounding the MAT1-1-1 gene in E. pseudodarliae and observed fragments of the MAT locus both up and downstream. These fragments and their orientation around MAT1-1-1 is similar to characterised heterothallic Botryosphaeriaceae. Based on these gene arrangements, we conclude that the new MAT1-1-1 containing locus likely originated from a cryptic DNA integration event between two heterothallic individuals. We hypothesise that this integration event led to the formation of a homothallic lineage, which is the common ancestor of E. darliae and E. pseudodarliae."

"28837853","abstracttext","Arabinoxylan (AX), a non-starch polysaccharide extracted from cereals such as wheat, rice and millets, is known to impart various health promoting effects. Our earlier study suggested that finger millet (FM) could ameliorate high fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic derangements. The present study is aimed to evaluate the effect of FM-AX supplementation, a key bioactive from finger millet, on HFD-induced metabolic and gut bacterial derangements. Male Swiss albino mice were fed with normal chow diet (NPD) or HFD (60%kcal from fat) for 10 weeks. FM-AX was orally supplemented at doses of 0.5 and 1.0g/kg bodyweight on every alternate day for 10 weeks. Glucose tolerance, serum hormones, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation, white adipose tissue marker gene expression, adipocyte size and inflammation; metagenomic alterations in cecal bacteria; cecal short chain fatty acids and colonic tight junction gene expressions were studied. FM-AX supplementation prevented HFD-induced weight gain, alerted glucose tolerance and serum lipid profile, hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammation. Hepatic and white adipose tissue gene expressions were beneficially modulated. Further, AX supplementation prevented metagenomic alterations in cecum; improved ileal and colonic health and overall prevented metabolic endotoxemia. Present work suggests that AX from finger millet can be developed as a nutraceutical for the management of HFD- induced obesity."

"28881082","abstracttext","A key member of the Pm21 resistance gene locus, Stpk-V, derived from Haynaldia villosa, was shown to confer broad-spectrum resistance to wheat powdery mildew. The present study was planned to investigate the resistance mechanism mediated by Stpk-V. Transcriptome analysis was performed in Stpk-V transgenic plants and recipient Yangmai158 upon Bgt infection, and detailed histochemical observations were conducted. Chromosome location of Stpk-V orthologous genes in Triticeae species was conducted for evolutionary study and over-expression of Stpk-V both in barley and Arabidopsis was performed for functional study. The transcriptome results indicate, at the early infection stage, the ROS pathway, JA pathway and some PR proteins associated with the SA pathway were activated in both the resistant Stpk-V transgenic plants and susceptible Yangmai158. However, at the later infection stage, the genes up-regulated at the early stage were continuously held only in the transgenic plants, and a large number of new genes were also activated in the transgenic plants but not in Yangmai158. Results indicate that sustained activation of the early response genes combined with later-activated genes mediated by Stpk-V is critical for resistance in Stpk-V transgenic plants. Stpk-V orthologous genes in the representative grass species are all located on homologous group six chromosomes, indicating that Stpk-V is an ancient gene in the grasses. Over-expression of Stpk-V enhanced host resistance to powdery mildew in barley but not in Arabidopsis. Our results enable a better understanding of the resistance mechanism mediated by Stpk-V, and establish a solid foundation for its use in cereal breeding as a gene resource."

Influences of different application methods of silicon (Si; 3 mM); soil treatment, foliar spray and seed soaking on growth, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic gas exchange, cell membrane injury, osmoprotectants contents, antioxidative defense system activity, and polyamines contents and their gene expression in wheat plants grown under normal and 2 mM cadmium (Cd) stress conditions were investigated in 3-repeated pot experiment. Cd stress severely depressed growth, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic gas exchange, tissue health, water use efficiency (WUE) and Si content, and elevated osmoprotectants and Cd 2+ contents, antioxidative defense system activity, and polyamines contents and their gene expression. However, Si in different application methods alleviated the Cd stress effects and significantly reduced Cd 2+ and MDA contents and electrolyte leakage, significantly increased growth, chlorophyll fluorescence, photosynthetic gas exchange, WUE, membrane stability index, relative water content and Si content, and further increased proline and soluble sugars contents, antioxidative (enzymatic and non-enzymatic) defense system activity, and polyamines contents and their gene expression. Among the three methods, Si applied as soil addition was the best and most effective in alleviating the Cd stress effects."

In order to increase our knowledge of it, we aimed to modulate brain protein synthesis rates through aging, variations in nutritional state (fed state vs. fasted state), high sucrose diet and micronutrient supplementation. Four groups of 16 month-old male rats were fed for five months with a diet containing either 13% or 62% sucrose (wheat starch was replaced with sucrose), supplemented or not with rutin (5 g kg-1 diet), vitamin E (4×), A (2×), D (5×), selenium (10×) and zinc (+44%) and compared with an adult control group. We measured cerebellum protein synthesis and hippocampus gene expression of antioxidant enzymes, inflammatory cytokines and transcription factors. We showed that cerebellum protein synthesis was unchanged by the nutritional state, decreased during aging (-8%), and restored to the adult level by micronutrient supplementation. Sucrose diet did not change protein synthesis but reduced the protein content. Micronutrient supplementation had no effect in sucrose fed rats. Hippocampus gene expressions were affected by age (an increase of TNF-α), sucrose treatment (an increase of IL-1β and IL-6), and micronutrient supplementation (a decrease of heme oxygenase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, TNF-α, and Nrf2). We noted that cerebellum protein synthesis and hippocampus TNF-α gene expression were modulated by the same factors: they were affected by aging and micronutrient supplementation and unchanged by feeding and by high sucrose diet."

"29891363","abstracttext","Resistance to the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase)- and acetolactate synthase (ALS)- inhibiting herbicides in shortawn foxtail (Alopecurus aequalis) has been reported in wheat fields of eastern China. To better understand the distribution of the resistant populations and the occurrence of the target-site mutations, 74 populations collected from Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong province were surveyed, and the ACCase and ALS gene fragments, encompassing all the documented mutant codon positions, were amplified and sequenced. Plants from 37 and 34 populations survived fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl treatment at 62.1 g a.i. ha -1 and 9 g a.i. ha -1 respectively, with different survival rates. Twenty-seven populations exhibited multiple resistance to fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl. Whole-plant dose-response experiments showed that the resistance index ranged from 6.2 to 167.8 for fenoxaprop-P-ethyl, and from 7.8 to 139.5 for mesosulfuron-methyl. Four ACCase (I1781L, I2041N, I2041T and D2078G) and four ALS (P197R, P197S, P197T and W574 L) resistance mutations were detected respectively. Individuals containing two amino acid substitutions were also found. D2078G and W574 L were predominant ACCase and ALS gene mutations respectively. This study has shown that fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl resistance was prevalent in A. aequalis in eastern China, and target site mutations in the ACCase and ALS gene were one of the most common mechanisms."

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the biocontrol potential of strain LM2303 against FHB, an integrated approach of genome mining and chemical analysis was employed. The whole genome of strain LM2303 was obtained and analyzed, showing the largest number of genes/gene clusters associated with biocontrol functions as compared with the known biocontrol strains (FZB42, M75, CAU B946). And strain LM2303 was accurately determined as a member of the B. velezensis clade using the phylogenomic analysis of single-copy core genes. Through genome mining, 13 biosynthetic gene clusters(BGCs) encoding secondary metabolites with biocontrol functions were identified, which were further confirmed through chemical analyses such as UHPLC-ESI-MS, including three antifungal metabolites (fengycin B, iturin A, and surfactin A), eight antibacterial metabolites (surfactin A, butirosin, plantazolicin and hydrolyzed plantazolicin, kijanimicin, bacilysin, difficidin, bacillaene A and bacillaene B, 7-o-malonyl macrolactin A and 7-o-succinyl macrolactin A), the siderophore bacillibactin, molybdenum cofactor and teichuronic acid. In addition, genes/gene clusters involved in plant colonization, plant growth promotion and induced systemic resistance were also found and analyzed, along with the corresponding metabolites. Finally, four different mechanisms of strain LM2303 involved in the biocontrol of FHB were putatively obtained. This work provides better insights into a mechanistic understanding of strain LM2303 in control of FHB, reinforcing the higher potential of this strain as a powerful biocontrol strain agent (BCA) for FHB control. The results also provide scientific reference and comparison for other biocontrol strains."

"30809363","abstracttext","Perylenequinones are a class of aromatic polyketides characterised by a highly conjugated pentacyclic core, which confers them with potent light-induced bioactivities and unique photophysical properties. Despite the biosynthetic gene clusters for the perylenequinones elsinochrome A ( 1 ), cercosporin ( 4 ) and hypocrellin A ( 6 ) being recently identified, key biosynthetic aspects remain elusive. Here, we first expressed the intact elc gene cluster encoding 1 from the wheat pathogen Parastagonospora nodorum heterologously in Aspergillus nidulans on a yeast-fungal artificial chromosome (YFAC). This led to the identification of a novel flavin-dependent monooxygenase, ElcH, responsible for oxidative enolate coupling of a perylenequinone intermediate to the hexacyclic dihydrobenzo( ghi )perylenequinone in 1 . In the absence of ElcH, the perylenequione intermediate formed a hexacyclic cyclohepta( ghi )perylenequinone system via an intramolecular aldol reaction resulting in 6 and a novel hypocrellin 12 with opposite helicity to 1 . Theoretical calculations supported that 6 and 12 resulted from atropisomerisation upon formation of the 7-membered ring. Using a bottom-up pathway reconstruction approach on a tripartite YFAC system developed in this study, we uncovered that both a berberine bridge enzyme-like oxidase ElcE and a laccase-like multicopper oxidase ElcG are involved in the double coupling of two naphthol intermediates to form the perylenequinone core. Gene swapping with the homologs from the biosynthetic pathway of 4 showed that cognate pairing of the two classes of oxidases is required for the formation of the perylenequinone core, suggesting the involvement of protein-protein interactions."

"31096323","abstracttext","The aim of the present study was to prove the long-term efficiency of the amendments zerovalent iron grit, zeolite, and Divergan® for trace metal remediation in heavily contaminated soils and to attain a recovery of microbial functionality and diversity by remediation. For immobilization of the trace metals the amendments zerovalent iron grit, natural zeolite, and Divergan® were used. Trace metal total and mobile contents were determined and bacterial communities were assessed after a SIP experiment with 13 C-labelled wheat root by Ion-Torrent Sequencing targeting the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and two trace metal resistant genes for copper and cadmium (copA and czcA gene). The results show that the remediation effect of the three amendments is still stable after five years. The mobile trace metal contents were significantly (≤0.001) reduced in all treatments, except the Cu content in the zeolite treatment. A higher diversity in active metabolizing and growing soil bacteria was observed in remediated soils as compared to the non-remediated control, especially for the Divergan® treatment. The bacterial genera Kribbella, Glycomyces, Inquilinus, Nocardioides, and Lysobacter are the most significantly enriched genera in the 13 C fractions of the treated samples. The occurrence of bacterial families, which could be identified carrying efflux-mediated metal resistance genes for Cd/Zn and Cu, were reduced in the remediated soils as compared to the non-remediated control. The most abundant bacterial family for the copA and the czcA gene is Xanthomonadaceae. The pH-value and the trace metal concentration could be identified as key drivers of bacterial community composition, and functions in trace metal contaminated soils and remediated soils."

"31160715","abstracttext","Tilletia indica (Ti) - a quarantined fungal pathogen of wheat and its pathogenesis is chiefly governed by pathogen effectors secreted inside the host plant. The de novo genome sequencing of several field isolates and stages available could be used for understanding the molecular pathogenesis. The presence of gaps and low coverage of assembled genomes poses a problem in accurate functional annotation of such functions. In the present study attempts were made to improve the Ti draft genome through reconciliation of globally available datasets of three highly virulent monoteliospore cultures of Ti field isolates. It has sequence depth of 107x and N50 scaffold size of 80,772 (more than 26 times as large as achieved in the draft assembly) with highest sequence contiguity, more accurate and nearly complete. Functional annotation revealed that Ti genome contains 9209 genes evolved with many expanded gene families and arranged mostly in a cluster. About 79% of Ti genes were orthologous to other basidiomycetes fungi, Around 7.93% proteins were having secretary signals and 6.66% were identified as highly virulent pathogenicity genes. Using improved Ti genome as a reference, the genomic variation was assessed with respect to repeats, SNPs/InDel, gene families and correct set of virulence associated genes during its life cycle. The comparative intra-species, inter-stage and inter-species genomic variation will have broader implications to understand the gene regulatory networks involved in growth, mating and virulence behaviour of Tilletia f. spp. and also for better appreciation of fungal biology and disease management."

"32782023","abstracttext_background","The ability of fungal cells to undergo cell-to-cell communication and anastomosis, the process of vegetative hyphal fusion, allows them to maximize their overall fitness. Previous studies in a number of fungal species have identified the requirement of several signaling pathways for anastomosis, including the so far best characterized soft (So) gene, and the MAPK pathway components MAK-1 and MAK-2 of Neurospora crassa. Despite the observations of hyphal fusions' involvement in pathogenicity and host adhesion, the connection between cell fusion and fungal lifestyles is still unclear. Here, we address the role of anastomosis in fungal development and asexual reproduction in Zymoseptoria tritici, the most important fungal pathogen of wheat in Europe."
"32782023","abstracttext_results","We show that Z. tritici undergoes self-fusion between distinct cellular structures, and its mechanism is dependent on the initial cell density. Contrary to other fungi, cell fusion in Z. tritici only resulted in cytoplasmic mixing but not in multinucleated cell formation. The deletion of the So orthologous ZtSof1 disrupted cell-to-cell communication affecting both hyphal and germling fusion. We show that Z. tritici mutants for MAPK-encoding ZtSlt2 (orthologous to MAK-1) and ZtFus3 (orthologous to MAK-2) genes also failed to undergo anastomosis, demonstrating the functional conservation of this signaling mechanism across species. Additionally, the ΔZtSof1 mutant was severely impaired in melanization, suggesting that the So gene function is related to melanization. Finally, we demonstrated that anastomosis is dispensable for pathogenicity, but essential for the pycnidium development, and its absence abolishes the asexual reproduction of Z. tritici."

"30208837","abstracttext_background","Plant fungal pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt to new environmental conditions in response to sudden changes of host populations in agro-ecosystems. However, the genomic basis of their host adaptation, especially at the forma specialis level, remains unclear."
"30208837","abstracttext_results","We sequenced two isolates each representing Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) and P. striiformis f. sp. hordei (Psh), different formae speciales of the stripe rust fungus P. striiformis highly adapted to wheat and barley, respectively. The divergence of Pst and Psh, estimated to start 8.12 million years ago, has been driven by high nucleotide mutation rates. The high genomic variation within dikaryotic urediniospores of P. striiformis has provided raw genetic materials for genome evolution. No specific gene families have enriched in either isolate, but extensive gene loss events have occurred in both Pst and Psh after the divergence from their most recent common ancestor. A large number of isolate-specific genes were identified, with unique genomic features compared to the conserved genes, including 1) significantly shorter in length; 2) significantly less expressed; 3) significantly closer to transposable elements; and 4) redundant in pathways. The presence of specific genes in one isolate (or forma specialis) was resulted from the loss of the homologues in the other isolate (or forma specialis) by the replacements of transposable elements or losses of genomic fragments. In addition, different patterns and numbers of telomeric repeats were observed between the isolates."
"30208837","abstracttext_conclusions","Host adaptation of P. striiformis at the forma specialis level is a complex pathogenic trait, involving not only virulence-related genes but also other genes. Gene loss, which might be adaptive and driven by transposable element activities, provides genomic basis for host adaptation of different formae speciales of P. striiformis."

"30604324","abstracttext_key message","PsLecRLK overexpression in rice provides tolerance against salinity stress and cause upregulation of SOS1 pathway genes, which are responsible for extrusion of excess Na+ ion under stress condition. Soil salinity is one of the most devastating factors threatening cultivable land. Rice is a major staple crop and immensely affected by soil salinity. The small genome size of rice relative to wheat and barley, together with its salt sensitivity, makes it an ideal candidate for studies on salt stress response caused by a particular gene. Under stress conditions crosstalk between organelles and cell to cell response is imperative. LecRLK is an important family, which plays a key role under stress conditions and regulates the physiology of the plant. Here we have functionally validated the PsLecRLK gene in rice for salinity stress tolerance and hypothesized the model for its working. Salt stress sensitive rice variety IR64 was used for developing marker-free transgenic with modified binary vector pCAMBIA1300 overexpressing PsLecRLK gene. Comparison of transgenic and wild-type (WT) plants showed better physiological and biochemical results in transgenic lines with a low level of ROS, MDA and ion accumulation and a higher level of proline, relative water content, root/shoot ration, enzymatic activities of ROS scavengers and upregulation of stress-responsive genes. Based on the relative expression of stress-responsive genes and ionic content, the working model highlights the role of PsLecRLK in the extrusion of Na + ion from the cell. This extrusion of Na + ion is facilitated by higher expression of SOS1 (Na + /K + channel) in transgenic plants as compared to WT plants. Altered expression of stress-responsive genes and change in biochemical and physiological properties of the cell suggests an extensive reprogramming of the stress-responsive metabolic pathways by PsLecRLK under stress condition, which could be responsible for the salt tolerance capability."

Sporulated oöcysts, morphologically consistent with previous accounts of E. macyi in other chiropterans, were spherical to sub-spherical in shape with a highly mamillated outer wall that appears bi-layered. Oöcysts allowed to sporulate in 2.5% potassium dichromate at ambient temperature (c.23°C) for 7 days were 17-25 × 15-20 (20.7 × 17.9) µm. Micropyle and oöcyst residuum were absent with one to two polar granules scattered among sporocysts. The four ovoid sporocysts were 7-12 × 6-8 (9.9 × 7.1) µm. Stieda bodies were prominent and sub-Stieda bodies were present. Two sporozoites were reflexed within each sporocyst. Nuclear 18S rRNA gene, plastid 23S rRNA gene and mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene were sequenced from sporulated oöcysts and compared to other molecular data of Eimeria spp. from rodent and chiropteran hosts. No sequence data in the NCBI database matched E. macyi. Phylogenetic analyses of the sequence data of the 18S rRNA and 23S rRNA genes placed E. macyi within a clade containing Eimeria spp. from rodents and basal to a clade populated by sequences derived from Eimeria spp. of rodents and bats. This account represents a new host record of E. macyi in an eastern red bat and a new geographic locality.

"30840164","abstracttext","Cochliobolus sativus (anamorph: Bipolaris sorokiniana) is a filamentous fungus from the class Dothideomycetes. It is a pathogen of cereals including wheat and barley, and causes foliar spot blotch, root rot, black point on grains, head blight, leaf blight, and seedling blight diseases. Annual yields of these economically important cereals are severely reduced due to this pathogen attack. Evolution of fungicide resistant pathogen strains, availability of a limited number of potent antifungal compounds, and their efficacy are the acute issues in field management of phytopathogenic fungi. Propiconazole is a widely used azole fungicide to control the disease in fields. The known targets of azoles are the demethylase enzymes involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. Nonetheless, azoles have multiple modes of action, some of which have not been explored yet. Identifying the off-target effects of fungicides by dissecting gene expression profiles in response to them can provide insights into their modes of action and possible mechanisms of fungicide resistance. Moreover it can also reveal additional targets for development of new fungicides. Hence, we analyzed the global gene expression profile of C. sativus on exposure to sub-lethal doses of propiconazole in a time series. The gene expression patterns were confirmed using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR). This study revealed overexpression of target genes from the sterol biosynthesis pathway supporting the reported mode of resistance against azoles. In addition, some new potential targets have also been identified, which could be explored to develop new fungicides and plant protection strategies."

"31726576","abstracttext","Biological nitrogen (N) fixation contributes to the pool of plant-available N in soil and helps to minimize the use of inorganic N fertilizer in agricultural ecosystems. Although diazotrophs play an important role in the biological fixation of atmospheric N 2 in a range of soil types, the knowledge of their response to biochar amendment is still limited. Here, using the nifH gene as a molecular marker, we investigated the short-term effect of biochar application on the abundance, community composition and activity of diazotroph in an alkaline soil. A field trial was established before soybean sowing in 2017 and five treatments were included: inorganic NPK fertilizer (CK); inorganic NPK fertilizer + wheat straw (CS); inorganic NPK fertilizer + low rate of biochar (B4); inorganic NPK fertilizer + high rate of biochar (B20); biochar compound fertilizer (BCF). The field trial was lasted for one crop season and samples were collected by soybean harvest. The results showed that biochar addition generally increased the concentration of soil organic carbon (SOC) and available phosphorous (AP), while B20 treatment significantly increased the total nitrogen (TN) and available potassium (AK). Biochar addition treatments increased the nifH gene abundance and altered the community structure of soil diazotrophs. The abundance of nifH gene was positively correlated with SOC, indicating that increasing SOC potentially affected diazotrophic population in the alkaline soil. Community structure of diazotrophs in the CS treatment was similar with the CK treatment; thus, there was no effect of crop straw on diazotroph community structure. In contrast, the application of biochar and biochar compound fertilizer altered the diazotroph community structure with shifts in the dominant genus, with higher Sinorhizobium in the biochar-amended treatments. SOC, C/N and AP were the key factors correlated with change in diazotroph community structure. Overall, our results suggest that the addition of biochar or biochar compound fertilizer could increase the abundance and alter the community structure of diazotrophs, which may benefit N fixation in alkaline agricultural soil. Conversely, the direct straw return had no effect on the abundance and community structure of diazotrophs."

"31424998","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight, also called scab, is caused by Fusarium graminearum and is one of the most important destructive diseases of wheat. The frequency of carbendazim resistance in 1,132 isolates of F. graminearum recovered from fields in different regions of Henan Province in 2016, 2017, and 2018 was determined. A total of 31 F. graminearum isolates resistant to carbendazim were detected, including 30 moderately resistant isolates and one highly resistant isolate. The frequency of resistance of F. graminearum isolates to carbendazim was 2.7%. The range of effective concentration (EC 50 ) values of 1,101 sensitive isolates and 30 moderately resistant isolates was 0.08 to 0.98 μg ml -1 and 2.73 to 13.28 μg ml -1 , respectively. The mean ± SD EC 50 value was 0.55 ± 0.13 μg ml -1 and 5.61 ± 2.58 μg ml -1 , respectively. The EC 50 value of the highly resistant isolate was 21.12 μg ml -1 . Point mutation types of the carbendazim-resistant isolates were characterized by cloning the β 2 -tubulin gene of 31 resistant isolates. Three point mutation types at amino acids F167Y, E198Q, and E198L in the β 2 -tubulin gene of resistant isolates were identified. Among 31 resistant isolates, the frequency of point mutation types in F167Y, E198Q, and E198L of the β 2 -tubulin gene was 71.0, 25.8, and 3.2%, respectively.

"31426752","abstracttext_results","In this study, the promoters of GAPCp2 and GAPCp3 were cloned. The promoter activities were significantly improved under abiotic stress via regulation of Rluc reporter gene expression, while promoter sequence analysis indicated that these fragments were not almost identical. In transgenic Arabidopsis with the expression of the GUS reporter gene under the control of one of these promoters, the activities of GUS were strong in almost all tissues except the seeds, and the activities were induced after abiotic stress. The yeast one-hybrid system and EMSA demonstrated that TaMYB bound TaGAPCp2P/3P. By analyzing different 5' deletion mutants of these promoters, it was determined that TaGAPCp2P (- 1312~ - 528) and TaGAPCp3P (- 2049~ - 610), including the MYB binding site, contained enhancer elements that increased gene expression levels under drought stress. We used an effector and a reporter to co-transform tobacco and found that TaMYB interacted with the specific MYB binding sites of TaGAPCp2P (- 1197~ - 635) and TaGAPCp3P (- 1456~ - 1144 and - 718~ - 610) in plant cells. Then, the Y1H system and EMSA assay demonstrated that these MYB binding sites in TaGAPCp2P (- 1135 and - 985) and TaGAPCp3P (- 1414 and - 665) were the target cis-elements of TaMYB. The deletion of the specific MYB binding sites in the promoter fragments significantly restrained the drought response, and these results confirmed that these MYB binding sites (AACTAAA/C) play vital roles in improving the transcription levels under drought stress. The results of qRT-PCR in wheat protoplasts transiently overexpressing TaMYB indicated that the expression of TaGAPCp2/3 induced by abiotic stress was upregulated by TaMYB."

"31616385","abstracttext","In filamentous fungi, gene silencing through RNA interference (RNAi) shapes many biological processes, including pathogenicity. We explored the requirement of key components of fungal RNAi machineries, including DICER-like 1 and 2 ( Fg DCL1, Fg DCL2), ARGONAUTE 1 and 2 ( Fg AGO1, Fg AGO2), AGO-interacting protein Fg QIP (QDE2-interacting protein), RecQ helicase ( Fg QDE3), and four RNA-dependent RNA polymerases ( Fg RdRP1, Fg RdRP2, Fg RdRP3, Fg RdRP4), in the ascomycete mycotoxin-producing fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum ( Fg ) for sexual and asexual multiplication, pathogenicity, and its sensitivity to double-stranded (ds)RNA. We corroborate and extend earlier findings that conidiation, ascosporogenesis, and Fusarium head blight (FHB) symptom development require an operable RNAi machinery. The involvement of RNAi in conidiation is dependent on environmental conditions as it is detectable only under low light (<2 μmol m -2 s -1 ). Although both DCLs and AGOs partially share their functions, the sexual ascosporogenesis is mediated primarily by Fg DCL1 and Fg AGO2, while Fg DCL2 and Fg AGO1 contribute to asexual conidia formation and germination. Fg DCL1 and Fg AGO2 also account for pathogenesis as their knockout (KO) results in reduced FHB development. Apart from KO mutants Δdcl2 and Δago1 , mutants Δrdrp2 , Δrdrp3 , Δrdrp4 , Δqde3 , and Δqip are strongly compromised for conidiation, while KO mutations in all RdPRs , QDE3 , and QIP strongly affect ascosporogenesis. Analysis of trichothecenes mycotoxins in wheat kernels showed that the relative amount of deoxynivalenol (DON), calculated as [DON] per amount of fungal genomic DNA was reduced in all spikes infected with RNAi mutants, suggesting the possibility that the fungal RNAi pathways affect Fg 's DON production. Moreover, silencing of fungal genes by exogenous target gene-specific double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (spray-induced gene silencing, SIGS) is dependent on DCLs, AGOs, and QIP, but not on QDE3. Together these data show that in F. graminearum , different key components of the RNAi machinery are crucial in different steps of fungal development and pathogenicity."

"31603940","abstracttext","Starch is synthesized from a series of reactions catalyzed by enzymes. ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) initiates the synthesis pathway and synthesizes ADP-glucose, the substrate of starch synthase (SS), of which SSIV is an isoform. Mutations of the AGPase subunit and SSIV-coding genes affect starch content and cause variation in the number of granules. Here, we pyramided the functional mutation alleles of the AGPase subunit gene TaAGP.L-B1 and the SSIV-coding gene TaSSIVb-D to elucidate their synergistic effects on other key starch biosynthesis genes and their impact on starch content. Both the TaAGP.L-B1 and TaSSIVb-D genes were expressed in wheat grain development, and the expression level of TaAGP.L-B1 was higher than that of TaSSIVb-D. The TaAGP.L-B1 gene was downregulated in the agp.L-B1 single and agp.L-B1/ssIV-D double mutants at 12 to 18 days after flowering (DAF). TaSSIVb-D expression was significantly reduced at 6 DAF in both ssIV-D single and double mutants. In the agp.L-B1/ssIV-D double mutant, TaGBSSII was upregulated, while TaAGPSS, TaSSI, and TaSBEII were downregulated. Under the interaction of these genes, the total starch and amylopectin contents were significantly decreased in agp.L-B1 and agp.L-B1/ssIV-D mutants. The results suggested that the mutations of TaAGP.L-B1 and TaSSIVb-D genes resulted in variation in the expression patterns of the other four starch synthetic genes and led to a reduction in starch and amylopectin contents. These mutants could be used further as germplasm for resistant starch analysis."

"31649704","abstracttext","The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) regulates plant growth and development, as well as responses to various stresses, such as salt and drought. The wheat TaFBA1 gene, which encodes an F-box protein, was previously identified in our laboratory by homologous cloning. We previously found that TaFBA1 expression was induced by ABA and drought stress. In this study, wild-type (WT), TaFBA1 over-expressing (OEs), TaFBA1 homologous gene mutants, and TaFBA1 recovery (Rs) Arabidopsis plants were used. We found that the germination rate, the cotyledon greening rate, the root length, and the photosynthetic performance of TaFBA1 OE plants were better than those of WT under drought and ABA conditions, but mutant plants showed the opposite trend, and overexpression of TaFBA1 in mutants can recover their phenotype. In addition, TaFBA1 was found to be a negative regulator of ABA-induced stoma movement; mRNA transcription of certain ABA signaling-related genes was lower in TaFBA1 OE plants than in WT plants following ABA treatment. Further, we found that TaFBA1 can interact with RCAR1 (an ABA receptor) and ABI5. BiFC assay showed that TaFBA1 may interact with RCAR1 in the plasma membrane. In addition, accumulation of ROS and MDA in TaFBA1 OE plants was lower than that in the WT plants after ABA and drought treatments. Based on these results, we suggest that TaFBA1-regulated ABA insensitivity may be dependent on regulating ABA-mediated gene expression through interacting with RCAR1 and ABI5. Increased antioxidant competence and decreased ROS accumulation may be an important mechanism that underlies improved drought tolerance in TaFBA1 OE plants."

"31680951","abstracttext","The mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEN) is produced by many plant pathogenic Fusarium species. It is well known for its estrogenic activity in humans and animals, but whether ZEN has a role in plant-pathogen interaction and which process it is targeting in planta was so far unclear. We found that treatment of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings with ZEN induced transcription of the AtHSP90.1 gene. This heat shock protein (HSP) plays an important role in plant-pathogen interaction, assisting in stability and functionality of various disease resistance gene products. Inhibition of HSP90 ATPase activity impairs functionality. Because HSP90 inhibitors are known to induce HSP90 gene expression and due to the structural similarity with the known HSP90 inhibitor radicicol (RAD), we tested whether ZEN and its phase I metabolites α- and ß-zearalenol are also HSP90 ATPase inhibitors. Indeed, At HSP90.1 and wheat Ta HSP90-2 were inhibited by ZEN and ß-zearalenol, while α-zearalenol was almost inactive. Plants can efficiently glycosylate ZEN and α/ß-zearalenol. We therefore tested whether glucosylation has an effect on the inhibitory activity of these metabolites. Expression of the A. thaliana glucosyltransferase UGT73C6 conferred RAD resistance to a sensitive yeast strain. Glucosylation of RAD, ZEN, and α/ß-zearalenol abolished the in vitro inhibitory activity with recombinant HSP90 purified from Escherichia coli . In conclusion, the mycotoxin ZEN has a very prominent target in plants, HSP90, but it can be inactivated by glycosylation. This may explain why there is little evidence for a virulence function of ZEN in host plants."

We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain fatty acid (SCFA) transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, 2%, or 5% FM) or FOS (~2%, 5%, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three SCFA transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at 2% and 5% FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53. These results suggest that fermentation alone is not the sole determinant of gene responses in the healthy rat colon."

"32992523","abstracttext","The 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductases ( OPRs ) have been proven to play a major role in plant development and growth. Although the classification and functions of OPRs have been well understood in Arabidopsis, tomato, rice, maize, and wheat, the information of OPR genes in cotton genome and their responses to biotic and abiotic stresses have not been reported. In this study, we found 10 and 9 OPR genes in Gossypium hirsutum and Gossypium barbadense , respectively. They were classified into three groups, based on the similar gene structure and conserved protein motifs. These OPR genes just located on chromosome 01, chromosome 05, and chromosome 06. In addition, the whole genome duplication (WGD) or segmental duplication events contributed to the evolution of the OPR gene family. The analyses of cis-acting regulatory elements of GhOPRs showed that the functions of OPR genes in cotton might be related to growth, development, hormone, and stresses. Expression patterns showed that GhOPRs were upregulated under salt treatment and repressed by polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG6000). The expression patterns of GhOPRs were different in leaf, root, and stem under V. dahliae infection. GhOPR9 showed a higher expression level than other OPR genes in cotton root. The virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) analysis suggested that knockdown of GhOPR9 could increase the susceptibility of cotton to V. dahliae infection. Furthermore, GhOPR9 also modulated the expressions of jasmonic acid (JA) pathway-regulated genes under the V. dahliae infection. Overall, our results provided the evolution and potential functions of the OPR genes in cotton. These findings suggested that GhOPR9 might play an important role in cotton resistance to V. dahliae ."
"33024042","articletitle","Chromatin Dynamics Contribute to the Spatiotemporal Expression Pattern of Virulence Genes in a Fungal Plant Pathogen."
"33024042","abstracttext","Dynamic changes in transcription profiles are key for the success of pathogens in colonizing their hosts. In many pathogens, genes associated with virulence, such as effector genes, are located in regions of the genome that are rich in transposable elements and heterochromatin. The contribution of chromatin modifications to gene expression in pathogens remains largely unknown. Using a combination of a reporter gene-based approach and chromatin immunoprecipitation, we show that the heterochromatic environment of effector genes in the fungal plant pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici is a key regulator of their specific spatiotemporal expression patterns. Enrichment in trimethylated lysine 27 of histone H3 dictates the repression of effector genes in the absence of the host. Chromatin decondensation during host colonization, featuring a reduction in this repressive modification, indicates a major role for epigenetics in effector gene induction. Our results illustrate that chromatin modifications triggered during host colonization determine the specific expression profile of effector genes at the cellular level and, hence, provide new insights into the regulation of virulence in fungal plant pathogens. IMPORTANCE Fungal plant pathogens possess a large repertoire of genes encoding putative effectors, which are crucial for infection. Many of these genes are expressed at low levels in the absence of the host but are strongly induced at specific stages of the infection. The mechanisms underlying this transcriptional reprogramming remain largely unknown. We investigated the role of the genomic environment and associated chromatin modifications of effector genes in controlling their expression pattern in the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici Depending on their genomic location, effector genes are epigenetically repressed in the absence of the host and during the initial stages of infection. Derepression of effector genes occurs mainly during and after penetration of plant leaves and is associated with changes in histone modifications. Our work demonstrates the role of chromatin in shaping the expression of virulence components and, thereby, the interaction between fungal pathogens and their plant hosts."

Fourteen lambda phage clones which covered the entire sequence of the peach cpDNA were digested by restriction enzymes (SalI, XhoI, BamHI, SacI, and PstI) used singly or in combination. The molecular size of peach cpDNA was estimated to be about 152 kb. The gene order and contents were revealed to be equivalent to those of standard type of angiosperms by the localization of 31 genes on the physical map. Eighteen accessions from 14 Prunus species (P. persica, P. mira, P. davidiana, P. cerasis, P. cerasifera, P. domestica, P. insititia, P. spinosa, P. salicina, P. maritima, P. armeniaca, P. mume, P. tomentosa, P. zippeliana, and P. salicifolia) and one interspecific hybrid were used for the structural analysis of cpDNAs. Seventeen mutations (16 recognition site changes and one length mutation) were found in the cpDNA of these 18 accessions by RFLP analysis allowing a classification into 11 genome types. Although the base substitution rate in the recognition site (100p = 0.72) of cpDNA in Prunus was similar to that of other plants, i.e., Triticum-Aegilops, Brassica, and Pisum, it differed from Pyrus (100p = 0.15) in Rosaceae. Seven mutations including one length mutation were densely located within a region of about 9.1 kb which includes psbA and atpA in the left border of a large single-copy region of Prunus cpDNAs. The length mutation was detected only in P. persica and consisted of a 277 bp deletion which occurred in a spacer region between the trnS and trnG genes within the 9.1 kb region. Additional fragment length mutations (insertion/deletion), which were not detected by RFLP analysis, were revealed by PCR and sequence analyses in P. zippeliana and P. salicifolia. All of these length mutations occurred within the 9.1 kb region between psbA and atpA. This region could be an intra-molecular recombinational hotspot in Prunus species."

"18470078","abstracttext","An improved system for identifying DNA sequences linked to a targeted region was developed by fractionating DNA sequences prior to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. In an attempt to identify DNA markers linked to a strong CCN resistance gene, Ccn-D1, in Triticum tauschii, DNA samples from individuals homozygous for resistance and susceptibility at the Ccn-D1 locus in a segregating progeny were bulked separately to produce ""near isogenic"" DNA pools. The polymerase chain reaction was employed to generate several DNA amplification products from each of the bulked DNA segregants using 240 random (RAPD) and 4 semirandom (consensus sequences of intron-splice junctions) primers. A DNA polymorphic fragment was apparent between the resistant and susceptible bulks using one of the semirandom primers. Hydroxylapatite chromatography of reannealed DNA (to Cot values > 100) was used to enrich low copy DNA sequences in the bulk DNA segregants (resistant and susceptible DNA pools). PCR analysis on the low copy enriched DNA pool increased the level of polymorphism detected between bulked segregants. One of the RAPD fragments present in only the resistant low copy DNA pool was cloned and mapped to the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 2D. By using the cloned RAPD fragment, csE20-2, to assay an RFLP locus in three independent F2 progenies, complete cosegregation was obtained with the Ccn-D1 locus. Joint segregation analysis from a genome-wide mapping of RFLP markers and a second CCN resistance in T. tauschii, Ccn-D2, showed this locus to be loosely linked to the proximal region of chromosome 2."

"16607031","abstracttext","Completed genome sequences provide templates for the design of genome analysis tools in orphan species lacking sequence information. To demonstrate this principle, we designed 384 PCR primer pairs to conserved exonic regions flanking introns, using Sorghum/Pennisetum expressed sequence tag alignments to the Oryza genome. Conserved-intron scanning primers (CISPs) amplified single-copy loci at 37% to 80% success rates in taxa that sample much of the approximately 50-million years of Poaceae divergence. While the conserved nature of exons fostered cross-taxon amplification, the lesser evolutionary constraints on introns enhanced single-nucleotide polymorphism detection. For example, in eight rice (Oryza sativa) genotypes, polymorphism averaged 12.1 per kb in introns but only 3.6 per kb in exons. Curiously, among 124 CISPs evaluated across Oryza, Sorghum, Pennisetum, Cynodon, Eragrostis, Zea, Triticum, and Hordeum, 23 (18.5%) seemed to be subject to rigid intron size constraints that were independent of per-nucleotide DNA sequence variation. Furthermore, we identified 487 conserved-noncoding sequence motifs in 129 CISP loci. A large CISP set (6,062 primer pairs, amplifying introns from 1,676 genes) designed using an automated pipeline showed generally higher abundance in recombinogenic than in nonrecombinogenic regions of the rice genome, thus providing relatively even distribution along genetic maps. CISPs are an effective means to explore poorly characterized genomes for both DNA polymorphism and noncoding sequence conservation on a genome-wide or candidate gene basis, and also provide anchor points for comparative genomics across a diverse range of species."

"19594313","abstracttext","The complete genome sequence of Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV), a member in the family Potyviridae, has been determined to be 10,266 nucleotides (nt) excluding the 3' polyadenylated tail. The genome encodes a large polyprotein of 3,112 amino acids with the ""hall-mark proteins"" of potyviruses, including a small overlapping gene, PIPO, in the P3 cistron. The genome of TriMV has an unusually long 5' nontranslated region of 739 nt with 12 translation initiation codons and three small open reading frames, which resemble those of the internal ribosome entry site containing 5' leader sequences of the members of Picornaviridae. Pairwise comparison of 10 putative mature proteins of TriMV with those of representative members of genera in the family Potyviridae revealed 33 to 44% amino acid identity within the highly conserved NIb protein sequence and 15 to 29% amino acid identity within the least conserved P1 protein, suggesting that TriMV is a distinct member in the family Potyviridae. In contrast, TriMV displayed 47 to 65% amino acid sequence identity with available sequences of mature proteins of Sugarcane streak mosaic virus (SCSMV), an unassigned member of the Potyviridae. Phylogenetic analyses of the complete polyprotein, NIa-Pro, NIb, and coat protein sequences of representative species of six genera and unassigned members of the family Potyviridae suggested that TriMV and SCSMV are sister taxa and share a most recent common ancestor with tritimoviruses or ipomoviruses. These results suggest that TriMV and SCSMV should be classified in a new genus, and we propose the genus Poacevirus in the family Potyviridae, with TriMV as the type member."

"22086332","abstracttext","Sequence comparison of orthologous regions enables estimation of the divergence between genomes, analysis of their evolution and detection of particular features of the genomes, such as sequence rearrangements and transposable elements. Despite the economic importance of Coffea species, little genomic information is currently available. Coffea is a relatively young genus that includes more than one hundred diploid species and a single tetraploid species. Three Coffea orthologous regions of 470-900 kb were analyzed and compared: both subgenomes of allotetraploid Coffea arabica (contributed by the diploid species Coffea eugenioides and Coffea canephora) and the genome of diploid C. canephora. Sequence divergence was calculated on global alignments or on coding and non-coding sequences separately. A search for transposable elements detected 43 retrotransposons and 198 transposons in the sequences analyzed. Comparative insertion analysis made it possible to locate 165 TE insertions in the phylogenetic tree of the three genomes/subgenomes. In the tetraploid C. arabica, a homoeologous non-reciprocal transposition (HNRT) was detected and characterized: a 50 kb region of the C. eugenioides derived subgenome replaced the C. canephora derived counterpart. Comparative sequence analysis on three Coffea genomes/subgenomes revealed almost perfect gene synteny, low sequence divergence and a high number of shared transposable elements. Compared to the results of similar analysis in other genera (Aegilops/Triticum and Oryza), Coffea genomes/subgenomes appeared to be dramatically less diverged, which is consistent with the relatively recent radiation of the Coffea genus. Based on nucleotide substitution frequency, the HNRT was dated at 10,000-50,000 years BP, which is also the most recent estimation of the origin of C. arabica."

"23687628","abstracttext","The sequences of x-type high-molecular-weight glutenin promoter (x-HGP) from 21 diploid Triticeae species were cloned and sequenced. The lengths of x-HGP varied from 897 to 955 bp, and there are 329 variable sites including 105 singleton sites and 224 polymorphic sites. Genetic distances of pairwise X-HGP sequences ranged from 0.30 to 16.40% within 21 species and four outgroup species of Hordeum. All five recognized regulatory elements emerged and showed higher conservation in the x-HGP of 21 Triticeae species. Most variations were distributed in the regions among or between regulatory elements. A 22 bp and 50 bp insertions which were the copy of adjacent region with minor change, were found in the x-HGP of Ae. speltoides and Ps. Huashanica, and could be regarded as genome specific indels. The phylogeny of media-joining network and neighbour-joining tree both supported the topology were composed of three sperate clusters. Especially, the cluster I comprising the x-HGP sequences of Aegilops, Triticum, Henrardia, Agropyron and Taeniatherum was highly supporting by both network and NJ tree. As conferring to higher level and temporal and spatial expression, x-HGP can used as the source of promoter for constructing transgenic plants which allow endosperm-specific expression of exogenous gene on higher level. In addition, the x-HGP has enough conservation and variation; so it should be valuable in phylogenetic analyses of Triticeae family members."

"24002549","abstracttext","The function of starch phosphorylase has long been debated on the regulation of starch metabolism during the growth and development of plants. In this study, we isolated starch phosphorylase genes (Pho1 and Pho2) from barley, characterized their gene and protein structures, predicated their promoter's cis-elements and analyzed expression patterns. Multiple alignments of these genes showed that (1) both Pho1 and Pho2 genes possess 15 exons and 14 introns in all but three of the species analyzed, Aegilops tauschii (for Pho1 which contains 16 exons and 15 introns), potato (for Pho1b which contains 14 exons and 13 introns), and Triticum uraru (for Pho2 which contains 15 exons and 14 introns); (2) the exon-intron junctions of Pho1 and Pho2 flanking the ligand-binding sites are more conservative than the other regions. Analysis of protein sequences revealed that Pho1 and Pho2 were highly homologous except for two regions, the N terminal domain and the L78 insertion region. The results of real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) indicated that Pho2 is mainly expressed in germinating seeds, and the expression of Pho1 is similar to that of starch synthesis genes during seed development in barley. Microarray-based analysis indicated that the accumulation of Pho1 or Pho2 transcripts exhibited uniform pattern both in various tissues and various stages of seed development among species of barley, rice, and Arabidopsis. Pho1 of barley was significantly down-regulated under cold and drought treatments, and up-regulated under stem rust infection. Pho2 exhibited similar expression to Pho1 in barley. However, significant difference in expression was not detected for either Pho1 or Pho2 under any of the investigated abiotic stresses. In Arabidopsis, significant down-regulation was detected for Pho1 (PHS1) under abscisic acid (ABA) and for Pho2 (PHS2) under cold, salt, and ABA. Our results provide valuable information to genetically manipulate phosphorylase genes and to further elucidate their regulatory mechanism in the starch biosynthetic pathway."

"24710875","abstracttext","By using 25 primer combinations, 563 AFLP markers segregating in a recombinant inbred population (103 lines, F9) derived from L94/Vada were generated. The 38 AFLP markers in common to the existing AFLP/RFLP combined Proctor/Nudinka map, one STS marker, and four phenotypic markers with known map positions, were used to assign present AFLP linkage groups to barley chromosomes. The constructed high-density molecular map contains 561 AFLP markers, three morphological markers, one disease resistance gene and one STS marker, and covers a 1062-cM genetic distance, corresponding to an average of one marker per 1.9 cM. However, extremely uneven distributions of AFLP markers and strong clustering of markers around the centromere were identified in the present AFLP map. Around the centromeric region, 289 markers cover a genetic distance of 155 cM, corresponding to one marker per 0.5 cM; on the distal parts, 906 cM were covered by 277 markers, corresponding to one marker per 3.3 cM. Three gaps larger than 20 cM still exist on chromosomes 1, 3 and 5. A skeletal map with a uniform distribution of markers can be extracted from the high-density map, and can be applied to detect and map loci underlying quantitative traits. However, the application of this map is restricted to barley species since hardly any marker in common to a closely related Triticum species could be identified."
"24985981","articletitle","Comparative analysis of gene expression among species of different ploidy."
"24985981","abstracttext","Interspecific comparative studies require that expression data be comparable among species, and when species with different levels of ploidy are contemplated the relative expression per cell should be obtained for accurate comparisons to be made. Quantitative reverse-transcription-PCR is the most popular and sensitive technique for the detection and quantification of mRNA in gene expression analysis. In recent years it has become clear that the choice of reference genes for the normalization of expression data is very important. Several studies have shown that the expression of the traditional housekeeping genes varies under certain situations; their use as reference genes in quantitative PCR assays can therefore lead to errors when interpreting the relative expression of target genes. Normalizing with respect to endogenous genes showing a constant level of expression per cell across species, however, provides an easy way of obtaining comparable expression data for other genes in those species. In this work, the validity of several candidate genes was examined across four diploid and polyploid species of the genera Triticum and Aegilops. Candidate reference genes were chosen among the traditional housekeeping genes used in quantitative PCR analysis, as well as others found to have stable levels of expression under different conditions in other studies. After the analyses, candidate genes were gathered into two groups according to the different levels of expression per cell seen in polyploid species. For the four species studied, two genes suitable for normalization procedures in interspecific studies were identified: cell division control protein and malate dehydrogenase. Both showed a constant number of transcripts per cell, independent of the level of ploidy."

"28569033","abstracttext","The full nucleotide sequences of the chloroplast encoded large subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (rbcL) are available for nine grass species and partial sequence data for one species. Relative rate tests of the ""molecular clock"" hypothesis suggest that rbcL evolved more rapidly in the lineage leading to Zea than in those leading to the other species. The estimated overall substitution rate for rbcL among these grasses is about 5 times 10 -10 substitutions per site per year, or about one-half the synonymous rate. The nine full sequences were analyzed by the UPGMA, Wagner parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Fitch-Margoliash methods. The latter three methods produced trees with the same topology. This topology largely agrees with current taxonomic evidence regarding the relationships among these grasses. UPGMA produced a topology that conflicts more substantially with available taxonomic evidence. Statistical comparison of the three alternative topologies for the subfamilies Panicoideae, Pooideae and Bambusoideae failed to support one of these topologies over the others, reflecting the taxonomic ambiguities surrounding the relationships among these taxa. Phylogenetic analyses based on the partial sequences of all 10 species gave conflicting results with regard to the relationship between Hordeum and Triticum, both members of the tribe Triticeae. This indicates that rbcL sequences contain too little information to resolve relationships among genera within this tribe. Overall, the results suggest that rbcL sequence data can provide some new information concerning grass phylogeny, but that the amount of available data from this gene is too small to differentiate statistically among alternative topologies for the grasses. Conflicting results from parsimony, maximum likelihood, and Fitch-Margoliash methods proved useful in exploring the validity of assumptions underlying these methods."
"28174574","articletitle","A Comprehensive Prescription for Plant miRNA Identification."
"28174574","abstracttext","microRNAs (miRNAs) are tiny ribo-regulatory molecules involved in various essential pathways for persistence of cellular life, such as development, environmental adaptation, and stress response. In recent years, miRNAs have become a major focus in molecular biology because of their functional and diagnostic importance. This interest in miRNA research has resulted in the development of many specific software and pipelines for the identification of miRNAs and their specific targets, which is the key for the elucidation of miRNA-modulated gene expression. While the well-recognized importance of miRNAs in clinical research pushed the emergence of many useful computational identification approaches in animals, available software and pipelines are fewer for plants. Additionally, existing approaches suffers from mis-identification and annotation of plant miRNAs since the miRNA mining process for plants is highly prone to false-positives, particularly in cereals which have a highly repetitive genome. Our group developed a homology-based in silico miRNA identification approach for plants, which utilizes two Perl scripts ""SUmirFind"" and ""SUmirFold"" and since then, this method helped identify many miRNAs particularly from crop species such as Triticum or Aegliops . Herein, we describe a comprehensive updated guideline by the implementation of two new scripts, ""SUmirPredictor"" and ""SUmirLocator,"" and refinements to our previous method in order to identify genuine miRNAs with increased sensitivity in consideration of miRNA identification problems in plants. Recent updates enable our method to provide more reliable and precise results in an automated fashion in addition to solutions for elimination of most false-positive predictions, miRNA naming and miRNA mis-annotation. It also provides a comprehensive view to genome/transcriptome-wide location of miRNA precursors as well as their association with transposable elements. The ""SUmirPredictor"" and ""SUmirLocator"" scripts are freely available together with a reference high-confidence plant miRNA list."
"28396677","articletitle","Gametocidal Factor Transferred from Aegilops geniculata Roth Can Be Adapted for Large-Scale Chromosome Manipulations in Cereals."
"28396677","abstracttext","Segregation distorters are curious, evolutionarily selfish genetic elements, which distort Mendelian segregation in their favor at the expense of others. Those agents include gametocidal factors (Gc), which ensure their preferential transmission by triggering damages in cells lacking them via chromosome break induction. Hence, we hypothesized that the gametocidal system can be adapted for chromosome manipulations between Triticum and Secale chromosomes in hexaploid triticale (× Triticosecale Wittmack). In this work we studied the little-known gametocidal action of a Gc factor located on Aegilops geniculata Roth chromosome 4M g . Our results indicate that the initiation of the gametocidal action takes place at anaphase II of meiosis of pollen mother cells. Hence, we induced androgenesis at postmeiotic pollen divisions (via anther cultures) in monosomic 4M g addition plants of hexaploid triticale (AABBRR) followed by production of doubled haploids, to maintain the chromosome aberrations caused by the gametocidal action. This approach enabled us to obtain a large number of plants with two copies of particular chromosome translocations, which were identified by the use of cytomolecular methods. We obtained 41 doubled haploid triticale lines and 17 of them carried chromosome aberrations that included plants with the following chromosome sets: 40T+Dt2RS+Dt2RL (5 lines), 40T+N2R (1), 38T+D4RS.4BL (3), 38T+D5BS-5BL.5RL (5), and 38T+D7RS.3AL (3). The results show that the application of the Gc mechanism in combination with production of doubled haploid lines provides a sufficiently large population of homozygous doubled haploid individuals with two identical copies of translocation chromosomes. In our opinion, this approach will be a valuable tool for the production of novel plant material, which could be used for gene tracking studies, genetic mapping, and finally to enhance the diversity of cereals."

"23259617","abstracttext_background","Low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) strongly influence the bread-making quality of bread wheat. These proteins are encoded by a multi-gene family located at the Glu-A3, Glu-B3 and Glu-D3 loci on the short arms of homoeologous group 1 chromosomes, and show high allelic variation. To characterize the genetic and protein compositions of LMW-GS alleles, we investigated 16 Aroona near-isogenic lines (NILs) using SDS-PAGE, 2D-PAGE and the LMW-GS gene marker system. Moreover, the composition of glutenin macro-polymers, dough properties and pan bread quality parameters were determined for functional analysis of LMW-GS alleles in the NILs."
"23259617","abstracttext_results","Using the LMW-GS gene marker system, 14-20 LMW-GS genes were identified in individual NILs. At the Glu-A3 locus, two m-type and 2-4 i-type genes were identified and their allelic variants showed high polymorphisms in length and nucleotide sequences. The Glu-A3d allele possessed three active genes, the highest number among Glu-A3 alleles. At the Glu-B3 locus, 2-3 m-type and 1-3 s-type genes were identified from individual NILs. Based on the different compositions of s-type genes, Glu-B3 alleles were divided into two groups, one containing Glu-B3a, B3b, B3f and B3g, and the other comprising Glu-B3c, B3d, B3h and B3i. Eight conserved genes were identified among Glu-D3 alleles, except for Glu-D3f. The protein products of the unique active genes in each NIL were detected using protein electrophoresis. Among Glu-3 alleles, the Glu-A3e genotype without i-type LMW-GS performed worst in almost all quality properties. Glu-B3b, B3g and B3i showed better quality parameters than the other Glu-B3 alleles, whereas the Glu-B3c allele containing s-type genes with low expression levels had an inferior effect on bread-making quality. Due to the conserved genes at Glu-D3 locus, Glu-D3 alleles showed no significant differences in effects on all quality parameters."
"23259617","abstracttext_conclusions","This work provided new insights into the composition and function of 18 LMW-GS alleles in bread wheat. The variation of i-type genes mainly contributed to the high diversity of Glu-A3 alleles, and the differences among Glu-B3 alleles were mainly derived from the high polymorphism of s-type genes. Among LMW-GS alleles, Glu-A3e and Glu-B3c represented inferior alleles for bread-making quality, whereas Glu-A3d, Glu-B3b, Glu-B3g and Glu-B3i were correlated with superior bread-making quality. Glu-D3 alleles played minor roles in determining quality variation in bread wheat. Thus, LMW-GS alleles not only affect dough extensibility but greatly contribute to the dough resistance, glutenin macro-polymers and bread quality."

"30722578","abstracttext","Seedling assays and field-based assessments are common approaches used in monitoring pathogenic variability of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Due to the many candidate genes for resistance, and the occasional presence of uncharacterized or unexpected resistance genes, interpretation of seedling and adult plant responses of stripe rust differential genotypes can be confounded. To facilitate data interpretation and overcome growth habit differences, a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) based on a susceptible selection of the widely susceptible Australian spring wheat cultivar Avocet was developed in Plant Breeding Institute, University of Sydney. During the 2011 rust survey of major wheat growing areas in Syria, we collected and recovered two isolates, one from bread wheat and one from durum, using susceptible cultivar Morocco. Fresh urediniospores collected from inoculated seedlings of cultivar Morocco under greenhouse conditions were used to infect a differential set of seedlings comprising the Avocet S NIL series with Yr1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 17, 27, 32, A, SP and a supplementary set of Kalyansona (Yr2), Fielder (Yr6, Yr20), Thatcher (Yr7), Federation*4/Kavkaz (Yr9), TP1295 and TP981 (Yr25), Ciano 79 and Opata 85 (Yr27), Lemhi (Yr21), Anza (YrA), Tres/6*Avocet 'S', Cook, Avocet S, and Federation following standard protocol (1). Seedling infection types (IT) were recorded 15 to 17 days post-inoculation using a 0, ;(fleck), 1 to 4 scale, with ITs 3 and 4 considered to be high. According to European race nomenclature (1), these isolates would be classified as 6 E0 and assumes that differential cultivars Lee (Yr7) and Heines Kolben should be susceptible. A low infection of ;N (necrotic areas without sporulation) was observed on Avocet S and Avocet NILs Yr1, 5, 8, 10, 15, 17, 32, A, and SP. NILs Yr6, 7, and 9 responded with high infection types. Among the supplementary set, IT ;N was recorded for Anza, Cook, Tres/6*Avocet S, Opata 85, and Ciano 79 whereas IT 3+4 occurred on Kalyansona, Fielder, Thatcher, Federation*4/Kavkaz, TP1295 and TP981, and Lemhi. Federation and Morocco were susceptible to both isolates. Based on these data we concluded that 1) Avocet S carries at least one effective gene for resistance to the two isolates (temporarily designated as YrAvS and perhaps the same as the gene(s) in Anza and Cook); and 2) since Avocet S was resistant, it was expected that all the NILs should also be resistant unless one of the selected resistance genes was closely linked in repulsion with the gene in Avocet S. Since such a situation is possible for only one line, other explanations are that the recurrent parent, Avocet S, was not genetically homogeneous, or more likely, that the genetic background of Avocet S was not fully regenerated during the six backcross and subsequent selfing generations. This work illustrates the problems that can arise when sets of differential genotypes that perform in a satisfactory way in a particular (limited) geographical area are applied globally. Pst races carrying avirulence genes that are not present in the original area where a differential cultivar is characterized for its susceptibility may be present in other areas. Consequently, a differential cultivar which was susceptible in the original area may unexpectedly exhibit resistance in a new region. Therefore, host lines considered to be ""universally susceptible"" in one region may not be susceptible globally. The resistance of Avocet S is yet to be characterized. Reference: (1) R.

In vivo gene transfer in adult mice with either envelope yielded low transduction efficiencies in hepatocytes following intravenous delivery. In marked contrast, neonatal gene transfer with the LCMV envelopes, and notably with the FIV-L260F vector, conferred abundant liver and lower level cardiomyocyte transduction as detected by luciferase assays, bioluminescent imaging, and β-galactosidase staining."

"23324356","abstracttext_background","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate gene expression via mRNA cleavage or translation inhibition. In spite of barley being a cereal of great economic importance, very little data is available concerning its miRNA biogenesis. There are 69 barley miRNA and 67 pre-miRNA sequences available in the miRBase (release 19). However, no barley pri-miRNA and MIR gene structures have been shown experimentally. In the present paper, we examine the biogenesis of selected barley miRNAs and the developmental regulation of their pri-miRNA processing to learn more about miRNA maturation in barely."
"23324356","abstracttext_results","To investigate the organization of barley microRNA genes, nine microRNAs - 156g, 159b, 166n, 168a-5p/168a-3p, 171e, 397b-3p, 1120, and 1126 - were selected. Two of the studied miRNAs originate from one MIR168a-5p/168a-3p gene. The presence of all miRNAs was confirmed using a Northern blot approach. The miRNAs are encoded by genes with diverse organizations, representing mostly independent transcription units with or without introns. The intron-containing miRNA transcripts undergo complex splicing events to generate various spliced isoforms. We identified miRNAs that were encoded within introns of the noncoding genes MIR156g and MIR1126. Interestingly, the intron that encodes miR156g is spliced less efficiently than the intron encoding miR1126 from their specific precursors. miR397b-3p was detected in barley as a most probable functional miRNA, in contrast to rice where it has been identified as a complementary partner miRNA*. In the case of miR168a-5p/168a-3p, we found the generation of stable, mature molecules from both pre-miRNA arms, confirming evolutionary conservation of the stability of both species, as shown in rice and maize. We suggest that miR1120, located within the 3' UTR of a protein-coding gene and described as a functional miRNA in wheat, may represent a siRNA generated from a mariner-like transposable element."
"23324356","abstracttext_conclusions","Seven of the eight barley miRNA genes characterized in this study contain introns with their respective transcripts undergoing developmentally specific processing events prior to the dicing out of pre-miRNA species from their pri-miRNA precursors. The observed tendency to maintain the intron encoding miR156g within the transcript, and preferences in splicing the miR1126-harboring intron, may suggest the existence of specific regulation of the levels of intron-derived miRNAs in barley."

"24186245","abstracttext","To study the phylogenetics of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) and its relatives we sequenced four loci on cytoplasmic genomes (two chloroplast and two mitochondrial) and analyzed mitochondrial RFLPs generated using probes for COXI, COXII, COXIII, Cob, 18S+5S, 26S, ATPase 6, ATPase 9, and ATPase α (D'Hont et al. 1993). Approximately 650 bp of DNA in the intergenic spacer region between rbcL and atpB and approximately 150 bp from the chloroplast 16S rDNA through the intergenic spacer region tRNA(val) gene were sequenced. In the mitochondrial genome, part of the 18S rRNA gene and approximately 150 bp from the 18S gene 3' end, through an intergenic spacer region, to the 5S rRNA gene were sequenced. No polymorphisms were observed between maize, sorghum, and 'Saccharum complex' members for the mitochondrial 18S internal region or for the intergenic tRNA(val) chloroplast locus. Two polymorphisms (insertion-deletion events, indels) were observed within the 18S-5S mitochondrial locus, which separated the accessions into three groups: one containing all of the Erianthus, Eccoilopus, Imperata, Sorghum, and 1 Miscanthus species; a second containing Saccharum species, Narenga porphyrocoma, Sclerostachya fusca, and 1 presumably hybrid Miscanthus sp. from New Guinea; and a third containing maize. Eighteen accessions were sequenced for the intergenic region between rbcL and atpB, which was the most polymorphic of the regions studied and contained 52 site mutations and 52 indels, across all taxa. Within the Saccharum complex, at most 7 site mutations and 16 indels were informative. The maternal lineage of Erianthus/Eccoilopus was nearly as divergent from the remaining Saccharum complex members as it was from sorghum, in agreement with a previous study. Sequences from the rbcL-atpB spacer were aligned with GENBANK sequences for wheat, rice, barley, and maize, which were used as outgroups in phylogenetic analyses. To determine whether limited intra-complex variability was caused by under sampling of taxa, we used seven restriction enzymes to digest the PCR-amplified rbcL-atpB spacer of an additional 36 accessions within the Saccharum complex. This analysis revealed ten restriction sites (none informative) and eight length variants (four informative). The small amount of variation present in the organellar DNAs of this polyploid complex suggests that either the complex is very young or that rates of evolution between the Saccharum complex and outgroup taxa are different. Other phylogenetic information will be required to resolve systematic relationships within the complex. Finally, no variation was observed in commercial sugarcane varieties, implying a world-wide cytoplasmic monoculture for this crop."
"25910679","articletitle","Chitin is a component of the Rhodnius prolixus midgut."
"25910679","abstracttext","Chitin is an essential component of the peritrophic matrix (PM), which is a structure that lines the insect's gut and protects against mechanical damage and pathogens. Rhodnius prolixus (Hemiptera: Reduviidae) does not have a PM, but it has an analogous structure, the perimicrovillar membrane (PMM); chitin has not been described in this structure. Here, we show that chitin is present in the R. prolixus midgut using several techniques. The FTIR spectrum of the KOH-resistant putative chitin-material extracted from the midgut bolus showed peaks characteristic of the chitin molecule at 3500, 1675 and 1085 cm(1). Both the midgut bolus material and the standard chitin NMR spectra showed a peak at 1.88 ppm, which is certainly due to methyl protons in the acetamide a group. The percentages of radioactive N-acetylglucosamine (CPM) incorporated were 2 and 4% for the entire intestine and bolus, respectively. The KOH-resistant putative chitin-material was also extracted and purified from the N-acetylglucosamine radioactive bolus, and the radioactivity was estimated through liquid scintillation. The intestinal CHS cDNA translated sequence was the same as previously described for the R. prolixus cuticle and ovaries. Phenotypic alterations were observed in the midgut of females with a silenced CHS gene after a blood meal, such as retarded blood meal digestion; the presence of fresh blood that remained red nine days after the blood meal; and reduced trachea and hemozoin content compared with the control. Wheat germ agglutinin (a specific probe that detects chitin) labeling proximal to the intestine (crop and midgut) was much lower in females with a silenced CHS gene, especially in the midgut region, where almost no fluorescence signal was detected compared with the control groups. Midguts from females with a CHS gene silenced by dsRNA-CHS and control midguts pre-treated with chitinase showed that the chitin-derived fluorescence signal decreased in the region around the epithelium, the region facing the midgut and projections towards the intestinal lumen when evaluated microscopically. The relative reduction in CHS transcripts by approximately 80% using an RNAi assay supports the phenotypical alterations in the midgut observed using fluorescence microscopy assays. These data show that chitin is present in the R. prolixus midgut epithelium and in its surface projections facing the lumen. The CHS gene expression and the presence of chitin in the R. prolixus midgut may suggest a target for controlling Chagas disease vectors and addressing this public health problem."
"30731996","articletitle","A Two-Step Molecular Detection Method for Pyrenophora tritici-repentis Isolates Insensitive to QoI Fungicides."
"30731996","abstracttext","Tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an important disease of wheat worldwide. To manage tan spot, quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) fungicides such as azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin have been applied in many countries. QoI fungicides target the cytochrome b (cyt b) site in complex III of mitochondria and, thus, pose a serious risk for resistance development. The resistance mechanism to QoI fungicides is mainly due to point mutations in the cyt b gene. The objective of this study was to develop a molecular detection method for the four currently known mutations responsible for shifts in sensitivity toward QoI fungicides in P. tritici-repentis. Twelve specific primers were designed based on sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information accessions AAXI01000704 and DQ919068 and used to generate a fragment of the cyt b gene which possesses four known single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These mutant clones served as positive controls because QoI-insensitive and -reduced-sensitive isolates of P. tritici-repentis have not yet been reported in the United States. The partial cyt b gene clones were sequenced to identify the SNPs at sites G143A and F129L. Genomic DNA of the mutated partial cyt b gene clones and the European QoI-insensitive and -reduced-sensitive isolates of P. tritici-repentis possessing G143A (GCT) and F129L (TTA, TTG, and CTC) mutations were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two specific primer pairs and were further digested with three specific restriction enzymes (BsaJI, Fnu4HI, and MnlI). The results of the digested PCR product from genomic DNA of known QoI-insensitive and -reduced-sensitive isolates of P. tritici-repentis had DNA bands consistent with the mutation GCT at G143A and the mutations TTA, TTG, and CTC at F129L. The amplified region at the F129 site also had 99% sequence similarity with P. teres, the net blotch pathogen of barley. To validate mutations, we further tested two isolates of P. teres known to have reduced sensitivity to QoI fungicides possessing the mutations TTA and CTC at F129L. After PCR amplification and restriction digestion, DNA bands identical to those observed for the partial cyt b mutant clones were detected. These results suggest that this newly developed two-step molecular detection method is rapid, robust, and specific to monitor QoI-insensitive and -reduce-dsensitive isolates of P. tritici-repentis."

"33049995","abstracttext","Detoxification of fusariotoxin is a type V Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance and is considered a component of type II resistance, which is related to the spread of infection within spikes. Understanding this type of resistance is vital for FHB resistance, but to date, nothing is known about candidate genes that confer this resistance in rye due to scarce genomic resources. In this study, we generated a transcriptomic resource. The molecular response was mined through a comprehensive transcriptomic analysis of two rye hybrids differing in the build-up of fusariotoxin contents in grain upon pathogen infection. Gene mining identified candidate genes and pathways contributing to the detoxification of fusariotoxins in rye. Moreover, we found cis regulatory elements in the promoters of identified genes and linked them to transcription factors. In the fusariotoxin analysis, we found that grain from the Nordic seed rye hybrid ""Helltop"" accumulated 4 times higher concentrations of deoxynivalenol (DON), 9 times higher nivalenol (NIV), and 28 times higher of zearalenone (ZEN) than that of the hybrid ""DH372"" after artificial inoculation under field conditions. In the transcriptome analysis, we identified 6675 and 5151 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in DH372 and Helltop, respectively, compared to non-inoculated control plants. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that DEGs were associated with glycolysis and the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in Helltop, whereas carbon fixation in photosynthesis organisms were represented in DH372. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of DEGs lead to identification of the metabolic and biosynthetic processes of peptides and amides in DH372, whereas photosynthesis, negative regulation of catalytic activity, and protein-chromophore linkage were the significant pathways in Helltop. In the process of gene mining, we found four genes that were known to be involved in FHB resistance in wheat and that were differentially expressed after infection only in DH372 but not in Helltop. Based on our results, we assume that DH372 employed a specific response to pathogen infection that led to detoxification of fusariotoxin and prevented their accumulation in grain. Our results indicate that DH372 might resist the accumulation of fusariotoxin through activation of the glycolysis and drug metabolism via cytochrome P450. The identified genes in DH372 might be regulated by the WRKY family transcription factors as associated cis regulatory elements found in the in silico analysis. The results of this study will help rye breeders to develop strategies against type V FHB."

"1203252","abstracttext","1. The action of gene Pln, previously characterized by the sterol ester patterns of mature whole wheat kernels, has been found to be restricted to the endosperm and not to affect the embryo, the pericarp or the seed coat. 2. The dominant allele Pln, which determines a sterol ester pattern with palmitate as the main ester, is also responsible for a low level of free sterol at maturity. A high level of free sterol is associated with the recessive allelet pln, which determines an ester pattern with linoleate as the main ester. 3. Divergence between the two phenotypes starts at about 21 days after anthesis, when cell proliferation has been completed, the aleurone layer has differentiated, and only cell enlargement is taking place. A marked increased in esterification, mainly by palmitate, which is controlled by the dominant allele, is concomitant with a sharp decrease in free sterol. 4. The increased net esterification is non-specific with respect to 4-demethyl sterols, because it affects the four main ones, namely sitosterol, stigmasterol, campesterol and cholesterol."

"1094273","abstracttext","Estrogen induces the synthesis and accumulation of the specific messenger RNA for the egg white protein ovalbumin. The messenger RNA has been purified to apparent homogeneity on a preparative scale and utilized to synthesize a radioactive complementary DNA copy. This complementary DNA probe was first used to reveal that although ovalbumin constitutes 60% of the total protein of chick oviduct the gene which codes for the ovalbumin nRNA is represented only once in each haploid genome: The induction of genetranscription and subsequent accumulation of ovalbumin mRNA during estrogen-mediated tissue differentiation was also investigated. Ovalbumin mRNA sequences were quantifiedusing the complementary DNA probe and by an in vitro heterologous translation system. Similar experiments were performed using chicks which were withdrawn from hormone treatment and then given a single injection of estrogen. The data suggest pure transcriptional control for the mechanism by which estrogen regulates the synthesis of the tissuespecific protein ovalbumin. Finally, several in vitro translation systems are comparedwith respect to their usefullness to assess the effects of hormones on mRNA production. It is concluded that the protein synthesis system derived from wheat germ offers thegreatest advantages for initial studies."
"2536143","articletitle","Tnt1, a mobile retroviral-like transposable element of tobacco isolated by plant cell genetics."
"2536143","abstracttext","Transposable elements can be identified by their ability to induce mutant alleles at new loci. The retrotransposon family is thought to transpose through an RNA intermediate and has many similarities to vertebrate proretroviruses. In plants, retrotransposons have been described in maize, Arabidopsis and wheat, and non-viral retroposons in maize. Most of these elements, however, have been found as non-mobile integrated units. Here, we report the isolation of the first tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) transposable element, Tnt1, which seems to be the most complete mobile retrotransposon characterized in higher plants. Tnt1 has been isolated after its transposition into the nitrate reductase (NR) structural gene of tobacco, and transposition events have been detected through in vitro selection of spontaneous NR-deficient (NR-) mutant lines in cell cultures derived from tobacco mesophyll protoplasts. Tnt1 is 5,334 nucleotides long, contains two 610-base-pair-long terminal repeats and a single open reading frame of 3,984 nucleotides. Comparison of the Tnt1 open reading frame coding potential with those of the Drosophila melanogaster copia retrotransposon, yeast Ty retrotransposon, and vertebrate proretroviruses revealed that Tnt1 is closely related to copia and carries all the functions known to be required for autonomous transposition by reverse transcription."

In view of their overall insulin resistance, we examined liver insulin receptor binding and tyrosine kinase activity from corpulent rats and lean littermates fed purified diets containing 54% sucrose or starch for about 12 wk. Specific 125I-insulin binding to crude liver membranes from female corpulent rats fed either starch or sucrose was reduced to approximately 50% of that seen in lean rats (14 vs. 7%). Affinity of insulin receptors was similar in all groups, suggesting that hyperinsulinemic corpulent rats possess fewer hepatic insulin receptors than do lean rats. Using similar numbers of wheat germ agglutinin-agarose (WGA)-purified insulin receptors with similar affinities for insulin, it was found that basal and insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of the synthetic tyrosine-specific kinase substrate poly(Glu, Tyr)4:1 was similar in lean and obese rats fed sucrose or starch. It is suggested that the contribution of the liver to the insulin resistance in obese SHR/N-cp rats probably lies distal to the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase."

"1965831","abstracttext","The glycoprotein Ib (GP Ib) is the major sialoglycoprotein on the platelet membrane and plays an important role in primary hemostasis. It was demonstrated that GP Ib is polymorphic: four different species of GP Ib (designated A, B, C and D) were observed, having molecular weights of 168, 162, 159 and 153 kiloDaltons, respectively. The polymorphism was first studied in the Japanese population and, subsequently, in Americans; a significant difference between the phenotype frequencies in the two populations was found. The authors report about GP Ib polymorphism patterns in the Italian population. GP Ib from normal subjects was analyzed by means of platelet protein SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting; GP Ib species immobilized onto nitrocellulose filters were coupled with wheat germ agglutinin and stained using immunoperoxidase. Despite some differences in phenotype distribution, statistical analysis did not show differences between Italian and U.S. Caucasian phenotype frequencies: this is attributable to rather similar gene frequencies in the two populations. In our platelet samples we only observed three GP Ib types, precisely the B, C and D types; therefore we can confirm the rarity of the A type in Caucasians, while it was well represented in the Japanese population."

"2057358","abstracttext","In this paper, we demonstrate that an autonomously replicating plant expression vector can be used for analysis of pre-mRNA splicing determinants in intact dicot cells. This vector system relies on the Agrobacterium-mediated transfection of leaf discs with the A component of the geminivirus tomato golden mosaic virus (TGMV). Insertion of intron sequences between viral promoter and terminator sequences results in the production of high levels of pre-mRNA transcripts that are effectively and accurately spliced in vivo. Introns from the soybean B-conglycinin gene are spliced at greater than 95% efficiency indicating that the high expression levels of precursor RNA do not exceed the intron splicing capacity of these cells. Introns from the pea and wheat rbcS genes are spliced at 85% and 73% efficiency, respectively, indicating that tobacco leaf disc nuclei are capable of effectively and accurately processing particular dicot and monocot introns. Inclusion of a dicot intron in an engineered construct results in a five-fold enhancement of the level of mRNA stably expressed in dicot nuclei."

"6122207","abstracttext","Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants resistant to the translational inhibitor emetine (Emt B mutants) express a single genetically altered 40S ribosomal subunit protein, S14. that appears to account for their drug resistance. To determine whether Emt B mutation affect the structural gene for the S14 protein, we isolated mRNAs from several wild-type and Emt B mutant clones. We translated the mRNAs in a cell-free system derived from wheat germ, and we discerned the biosynthesis of 59 ribosomal proteins, including S14. In every case, poly(A)+ mRNA programmed the cell-free system to synthesize an S14 protein electrophoretically identical to the S14 extracted from the ribosomes of the corresponding cell line. Messages from two Emt B mutants (Emr-2 and Emr-2-2) specified S14s that were electrophoretically distinct from the wild-type protein. Thus, Emt B mutations were expressed in mutant cell mRNAs, apparently reflecting mutagen-induced changes in S14 structural genes."

"6289070","abstracttext","Variant neuroblastoma cell clones were selected for resistance to the cytotoxic effects of neurotoxins that cause persistent activation of sodium channels. Three classes of variant clones were obtained: sodium channel-deficient clones, which have markedly reduced numbers of functional sodium channels; scorpion toxin-resistant clones, which have sodium channels with an altered interaction with scorpion toxin; and parental-type clones, which have functional sodium channels similar to the ones from N18 cells but have other heritable alterations that confer toxin resistance. The frequency of conversion to all three variant phenotypes was enhanced by treatment with the missense mutagen N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), suggesting that all three variant phenotypes are the result of mutational events. Incorporation of [35S]methionine into the alpha-subunit of the sodium channel (Mr = 270,000; pI = 5.8 +/- 0.2) was studied in normal and variant clones by affinity chromatography on wheat germ agglutinin/Sepharose followed by analysis of labeled polypeptides by 1- and 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Sodium channel-deficient clones do not synthesize the alpha-subunit of the sodium channel, suggesting that mutations in these clones block expression of the gene for this protein subunit. The scorpion toxin-resistant clone LV10 synthesizes an alpha-subunit which has a molecular weight and pI similar to those of the parental clones within the resolution of the methods used."

The specificity of this assay was demonstrated by its ability to selectively precipitate cytochrome c from an autolysate of yeast cell proteins. Translation of the polypeptide chain of cytochrome c in a wheat germ extract programmed with yeast poly(A) RNA was demonstrated using this immunoprecipitation assay. Translation of poly(A) RNA from yeast strains carrying nonsense mutations in the cyc1 gene yielded in vitro cytochrome c polypeptides which were shorter than the wild type protein by the amount expected for polypeptide chains which had terminated at the nonsense codon. The in vivo rate of cytochrome c synthesis was shown to be 6-fold greater in derepressed cells than in glucose-repressed cells. The 6-fold difference is sufficient to account for the 6-fold higher level of cytochrome c in derepressed than in repressed cells. The level of translatable cytochrome c mRNA is at least 4 times as high in derepressed as in glucose-repressed cells, suggesting that regulation occurs at some step in the synthesis of this messenger."

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of Sed(1,7)P2ase with those of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase [Fru(1,6)P2ase] enzymes from a variety of sources reveals 19% identity, rising to 42% if conservative changes are considered. Most importantly, the amino acid residues which form the active site of Fru(1,6)P2ase are highly conserved in the Sed(1,7)P2ase molecule, indicating a common catalytic mechanism. Interestingly, although the activities of both Sed(1,7)P2ase and chloroplast Fru(1,6)P2ase are modulated by light via the thioredoxin system, the amino acid sequence motif identified as having a role in this regulation in chloroplast Fru(1,6)P2ase is not found in the Sed(1,7)P2ase enzyme."

In the first step, a homopolymeric oligo(dC) tail was added to the 3' end of single-stranded cDNAs. The two SS cDNAs were amplified, one with a 5' end (SSp1) and the other with a 3' end (SSp2) using one internal SS primer and the other anchored end primer. Finally, overlapping fragments were identified by restriction mapping, and the non-overlapping fragments were excised and religated to reconstruct full-length cDNA. Partial sequences of the reconstructed cDNAs (SS-5' and SS-3') were compared with the published SS sequences to confirm that the amplified DNA was a copy of the SS transcript."

"1309819","abstracttext","GLUT1, the erythrocyte glucose transporter, and GLUT4, the adipose/muscle transporter, were each expressed in NIH-3T3 cells by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. In fibroblasts overexpressing GLUT1, basal as well as insulin-stimulated deoxyglucose uptake was increased. Expression of GLUT4 was without affect on either basal or hormone stimulated hexose uptake. Localization of each of the transporters by indirect immunofluorescence revealed that, whereas GLUT1 was found primarily on the cell surface, GLUT4 was directed to vesicles in a perinuclear distribution and throughout the cytoplasm. The GLUT4-containing compartment represented neither Golgi complex nor lysosomes, as evidenced by the failure of lgp110 or Golgi mannosidase to co-localize. However, there was substantial overlap between the distribution of GLUT4 and the transferrin receptor, and some colocalization of the transporter isoform with the manose-6-phosphate receptor. In addition, when FITC-wheat germ agglutinin bound to the cell surface was allowed to internalize at 37 degrees C, it concentrated in vesicular structures coincident with GLUT4 immunoreactivity. These data establish that GLUT1 and GLUT4 contain within their amino acid sequences information which dictates targeting to distinct cellular compartments. Moreover, GLUT4 can be recognized by those cellular factors which direct membrane proteins to the endosomal pathway."

"1404597","abstracttext","Upon infection of tobacco protoplasts, the genomic RNA of tobacco necrosis virus strain A (TNV-A) accumulates linearly in time. The accumulation patterns of the two subgenomic RNAs resemble those of endogenous mRNAs in that the peak levels are reached after several hours. The accumulation of the 1.3-kb subgenomic RNA is delayed by 1 h compared with that of the 1.6-kb subgenomic RNA, which illustrates the important role of the subgenomic RNAs in the regulation of TNV-A gene expression. The locations of the 5' nucleotides of the subgenomic RNAs reveal that the 5'-proximal cistrons of the 1.6- and 1.3-kb RNAs encode an 8-kDa protein from open reading frame (ORF) 3 and the coat protein from ORF 5, respectively. In a wheat germ translation system, a synthetic transcript resembling the 1.6-kb RNA expresses both ORFs 3 and 4. Moreover, the synthesis of the 6-kDa protein from ORF 4 depends on the translation efficiency of ORF 3, suggesting that in vivo, ORFs 3 and 4 are both expressed from the 1.6-kb RNA. The major in vitro translation product of TNV-A genomic RNA is the coat protein. We show that the region upstream of the coat protein promotes internal initiation of translation in vitro. However, this region is functionally inactive in vivo, suggesting that TNV-A genomic RNA is not important for coat protein synthesis in plants."

"1406724","abstracttext","The distribution of allergenic proteins was investigated in various tissues of white birch, Betula verrucosa (pollen, leaves and male inflorescences containing immature pollen). In addition, callus and suspension culture cells were investigated for expression of IgE-binding proteins. Furthermore, RNA was extracted from all these tissues and subjected to in vitro translation in a cell-free wheat germ system. Bet v I, the major birch pollen allergen, could be extracted easily from pollen, and in low amounts from callus and leaves. No Bet v I could be extracted from immature male inflorescences. Minor allergens were expressed in high concentrations in pollen and in low concentrations in immature male inflorescences. No minor allergens could be detected in callus and leaves. In contrast to these observations, RNA from all the tissues as well as from callus could be translated in vitro into Bet v I as well as into minor allergens, in particular birch profilin (Bet v II), an important minor allergen. These data suggest that IgE-binding proteins of B. verrucosa, especially Bet v I, under certain circumstances can readily be synthesized in tissues other than pollen. This concept is corroborated by the recent observation that Bet v I reveals high homology with disease resistance response gene products from other plants, suggesting a similar function of Bet v I for the birch."

"1582418","abstracttext","All eukaryotic cytoplasmic tRNAs(Tyr) contain pseudouridine in the centre of the anticodon (psi 35). Recently, it has been shown that the formation of psi 35 is dependent on the presence of introns in tRNA(Tyr) genes. Furthermore, we have investigated the structural and sequence requirements for the biosynthesis of psi 35. A number of mutant genes were constructed by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of a cloned Arabidopsis tRNA(Tyr) gene. Nucleotide exchanges were produced in the first and third positions of the anticodon and at positions adjacent to the anticodon. Moreover, insertion and deletion mutations were made in the anticodon stem and in the intron. The mutant genes were transcribed in HeLa cell extract and the pre-tRNAs(Tyr) were used for studying psi 35 biosynthesis in HeLa cell and wheat germ extracts. We have made the following observations about the specificity of plant and vertebrate psi 35 syntheses: (i) insertion or deletion of one base pair in the anticodon stem does not influence the efficiency and accuracy of the psi 35 synthase; (ii) the presence of U35 in a stable double-stranded region prevents its modification to psi 35; and (iii) the consensus sequence U33N34U35A36Pu37 in the anticodon loop is an absolute requirement for psi 35 synthesis. Thus, psi 35 synthases recognize both tRNA tertiary structure and specific sequences surrounding the nucleotide to be modified."
"1516818","articletitle","Characterization of Caenorhabditis elegans lectin-binding mutants."
"1516818","abstracttext","We have identified 45 mutants of Caenorhabditis elegans that show ectopic surface binding of the lectins wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and soybean agglutinin (SBA). These mutations are all recessive and define six genes: srf-2, srf-3, srf-4, srf-5, srf-8 and srf-9. Mutations in these genes fall into two phenotypic classes: srf-2, -3, -5 mutants are grossly wild-type, except for their lectin-binding phenotype; srf-4, -8, -9 mutants have a suite of defects, including uncoordinated movement, abnormal egg laying, and defective copulatory bursae morphogenesis. Characterization of these pleiotropic mutants at the cellular level reveals defects in the migration of the gonadal distal tip cell and in axon morphology. Unexpectedly, the pleiotropic mutations also interact with mutations in the lin-12 gene, which encodes a putative cell surface receptor involved in the control of cell fate. We propose that the underlying defect in the pleiotropic mutations may be in the general processing or secretion of extracellular proteins."
"564902","articletitle","A portion of all major classes of histone messenger RNA in amphibian oocytes is polyadenylated."
"564902","abstracttext","Ovaries of the amphibian Triturus viridescens contain a considerable amount of 7 to 12 S RNA which fractionates with poly(A)+ RNA on oligo(dT)-cellulose column chromatography and directs the synthesis of all five classes of histones in a wheat germ cell-free system. The polyadenylate tracts associated with this 7 to 12 S poly (A)+ RNA are heterogeneous in length, ranging from approximately 60 to 120 nucleotides. Partially purified subfractions of histone mRNA templates were isolated from this RNA by preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The correlation between the poly(A) content, the template activity in vitro, and the cell-free products encoded by these RNA subfractions suggests that Triturus ovary RNA contains poly(A)+ histone mRNA. The 7 to 12 S poly(A)+ RNA, but not 7 to 12 S poly(A)- RNA, is an effective template for the avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase-directed synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) in the presence of oligo(dT) primer. In the absence of primer, virtually no cDNA is synthesized. When cDNA complementary to 7 to 12 S poly(A)+ RNA is hybridized in situ to Drosophila melanogaster polytene chromosome preparations. cDNA hybrids are found primarily in the region 39D-E, the locus of the histone genes in Drosophila. This cDNA also hybridizes to the sea urchin histone gene sequences contained in the chimeric bacterial plasmids pSp2 and pSp17. These results provide strong evidence for the reality of polyadenylated histone mRNA in Triturus ovary."

"279359","abstracttext","Various mouse erythroleukemia cell lines show unique responses to chemical inducers. Lines 745 and 707, from DBA/2 mice, produced 25%--48% beta-minor and 78%--52% beta-major globin following culture with DMSO. Butyric acid treatment led to approximately 40% beta-minor globin, while induction with hemin resulted in over 80% beta-minor synthesis. Line FSD was developed independently. DMSO induction led to less than 10% beta-minor globin, while hemin and butyric acid both resulted in approximately 40% beta-minor synthesis. T3C12 and 5000 originated in DDD mice. With these lines all inducers led to only beta-major and no beta-minor synthesis. The inducers did not influence protein stability or initiation of globin synthesis. Translation of poly A-containing cytoplasmic RNA in a wheat germ cell-free system led to proportions of beta-minor that were the same as those seen in the intact cells. Thus regulation of the type of globin chain produced in erythroleukemia cells following culture with several inducing agents occurs at either the level of gene transcription or posttranslational processing, or by growth of a selected cell population."
"1065885","articletitle","Chick cytoplasmic actin and muscle actin have different structural genes."
"1065885","abstracttext","Actins isolated from embryonic chick brain and muscle differ in mobility when subjected to electrophoresis in gels containing urea and sodium dodecyl sulfate. Experiments were carried out to determine whether these actins are products of different structural genes and differ in primary amino acid sequence, or whether they are products of the same structural gene but are different because of post-translational modification. Messenger RNA from brain and muscle tissue was used to direct cell-free protein synthesis in wheat germ extracts. The synthesized actins were identified by conversion from globular to fibrous actin and by two-dimensional chromatographic analysis of tryptic peptides. The differences in electrophoretic mobility of brain compared to muscle actin were maintained in the cell-free protein synthetic products. Therefore, these mobility differences were not due to post-translational modification. It was concluded that brain and muscle actin are coded by different messenger RNAs and therefore arise from different structural genes. In addition, messenger RNA from 13- and 16-day embryonic thigh muscle directed the synthesis of both brain- and muscle-type actins, suggesting that muscle cell differentiation involves the regulation of at least two different actin genes."
"2195130","articletitle","Binding activity and autophosphorylation of the insulin receptor from patients with myotonic dystrophy."
"2195130","abstracttext","To clarify a mechanism of insulin resistance associated with myotonic dystrophy, we studied the insulin receptor by using three different types of cells--circulating erythrocytes, cultured skin fibroblasts, and Epstein-Barr virus(EBV)-transformed lymphocytes. In myotonic dystrophy, insulin binding to erythrocytes and fibroblasts was significantly decreased as a result of a reduction of the binding affinity. Insulin binding to EBV-transformed lymphocytes was normal. When the receptors were purified from fibroblasts with wheat germ agglutinin, we could not find a decrease in the binding affinity seen in the intact cells. No difference was observed in the magnitude of basal and insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation of insulin receptors from EBV-transformed lymphocytes between the control and myotonic dystrophy. Southern blot analysis of the insulin receptor gene revealed no restriction fragment length polymorphism associated with myotonic dystrophy. These findings suggest that there is no primary defect of the insulin receptor per se in terms of insulin binding and autophosphorylation in myotonic dystrophy. The reduction of the insulin binding to erythrocytes and fibroblasts may be caused by the plasma membrane abnormality that affects the binding affinity of the receptor."
"2672001","articletitle","Immunological demonstration of the accumulation of insulin, but not insulin receptors, in nuclei of insulin-treated cells."
"2672001","abstracttext","Although insulin is known to regulate nuclear-related processes, such as cell growth and gene transcription, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Previous studies suggested that translocation of insulin or its receptor to cell nuclei might be involved in some of these processes. The present investigation demonstrated that intact insulin, but not the insulin receptor, accumulated in nuclei of insulin-treated cells. Cell fractionation studies demonstrated that the nuclear accumulation of 125I-labeled insulin was time-, temperature-, and insulin-concentration-dependent. Electron microscopic immunocytochemistry demonstrated that the insulin that accumulated in the nucleus was immunologically intact and associated with the heterochromatin. Only 1% of the 125I-labeled insulin extracted from isolated nuclei was eluted from a Sephadex G-50 column as 125I-labeled tyrosine. Plasma membrane insulin receptors were not detected in the nucleus by immuno electron microscopy or when wheat germ agglutinin-purified extracts of the nuclei were subjected to PAGE, electrotransfer, and immunoblotting with anti-insulin receptor antibodies. These results suggested that internalized insulin dissociated from its receptor and accumulated in the nucleus without its membrane receptor. We propose that some of insulin's effects on nuclear function may be caused by the translocation of the intact and biologically active hormone to the nucleus and its binding to nuclear components in the heterochromatin."
"3127057","articletitle","The yeast GTP-binding YPT1 protein and a mammalian counterpart are associated with the secretion machinery."
"3127057","abstracttext","A yeast GTP-binding protein, the YPT1 gene product, has been found to function early in the secretion pathway. The ypt1-1 mutation causes a phenotype reminiscent of early secretion-defective mutants, including accumulation of membranes and vesicles as well as a partial defect in secretion and incomplete glycosylation of invertase. Immunofluorescence localization studies using affinity-purified antibody directed against the YPT1 protein showed punctate staining of the cytoplasm of growing yeast cells and very intense staining of small buds, where membrane growth and secretion are most active. The punctate cytoplasmic staining is changed in a mutant (sec7) under conditions that cause aberrant Golgi structures to accumulate. The pattern of immunofluorescence obtained when mouse cells were stained with the antibody coincided closely with the pattern observed with wheat germ agglutinin, suggesting that a mammalian counterpart of the yeast YPT1 protein is located in the Golgi apparatus. These results are interpreted as suggesting that GTP-binding proteins may act to direct intracellular vesicle traffic."
"2882416","articletitle","Translational control of ribosomal protein synthesis during early Dictyostelium discoideum development."
"2882416","abstracttext","Throughout the developmental program of Dictyostelium discoideum there are substantial changes in the rates of both ribosome utilization and rRNA transcription and processing. We examined the regulation of ribosomal protein (r-protein) gene expression and found that, at the start of development, expression of these genes was drastically and specifically reduced by a block to translational initiation. An apparently separate event signals a sudden decrease in the relative amount of r-protein mRNA at about 10 h of development, a time when aggregated amoebae are forming tight cell-cell contacts. For the first 9 h of development, the relative amount of r-protein mRNA remained essentially unchanged and comparable to levels detected in growing cells. While the r-protein mRNAs were almost fully loaded on polysomes during vegetative growth, they were specifically excluded from polysomes at the start of development. The translational block was not the result of irreversible structural changes which inactivate the r-protein mRNAs since they remained translatable both in vitro, in wheat germ extracts, and in vivo, where they were recruited onto polysomes in the presence of the elongation inhibitor cycloheximide. In addition, precise measurements of poly(A) tail lengths on individual hybrid-selected mRNA species showed that there is no difference in the poly(A) tail length of r-protein mRNA isolated from growing cells and 1-h developing cells. Therefore, changes in translational efficiency cannot be attributed to cleavage of poly(A) tails."
"2885245","articletitle","Molecular evolution and nucleotide sequences of the maize plastid genes for the alpha subunit of CF1 (atpA) and the proteolipid subunit of CF0 (atpH)."
"2885245","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequences of the maize plastid genes for the alpha subunit of CF1 (atpA) and the proteolipid subunit of CF0 (atpH) are presented. The evolution of these genes among higher plants is characterized by a transition mutation bias of about 2:1 and by rates of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution which are much lower than similar rates for genes from other sources. This is consistent with the notion that the plastid genome is evolving conservatively in primary sequence. Yet, the mode and tempo of sequence evolution of these and other plastid-encoded coupling factor genes are not the same. In particular, higher rates of nonsynonymous substitution in atpE (the gene for the epsilon subunit of CF1) and higher rates of synonymous substitution in atpH in the dicot vs. monocot lineages of higher plants indicate that these sequences are likely subject to different evolutionary constraints in these two lineages. The 5'- and 3'-transcribed flanking regions of atpA and atpH from maize, wheat and tobacco are conserved in size, but contain few putative regulatory elements which are conserved either in their spatial arrangement or sequence complexity. However, these regions likely contain variable numbers of ""species-specific"" regulatory elements. The present studies thus suggest that the plastid genome is not a passive participant in an evolutionary process governed by a more rapidly changing, readily adaptive, nuclear compartment, but that novel strategies for the coordinate expression of genes in the plastid genome may arise through rapid evolution of the flanking sequences of these genes."

"3579867","abstracttext","The proteins of Hordeum chilense grain were resolved into 25 major components by two-dimensional electrophoresis. Their solubilities in aqueous alcohol solutions were determined to distinguish prolamin storage proteins from metabolic and structural proteins. The prolamins were divided into two groups, based on the presence or absence of intermolecular disulfide bonds determined by gel-filtration chromatography. Using an incomplete set of Chinese Spring wheat-H. chilense disomic addition lines, the structural genes of 21 of the 26 most dominant seed proteins were assigned to chromosomes. The great majority of the prolamin genes, including those coding for a high molecular weight (HMW) prolamin subunit, was present on chromosome 1 Hch. However, a small number of prolamin genes also occurred on chromosomes 5 Hch and 7 Hch. A minor protein, probably belonging to the nonstorage group of proteins, is coded by genes on 5 Hch. Various ditelosomic addition lines and ditelosomic and disomic substitution lines for chromosome 7 Hch were also analyzed by electrophoresis. This technique revealed that the genes for three major prolamins occur on the beta arm of chromosome 7 Hch and that a gene for a minor protein, also thought to be a prolamin, occurs on the alpha arm. These results are discussed in relation to the evolution of prolamin genes in the Triticeae."

"2164215","abstracttext","35S-labeled Drosophila melanogaster apocytochrome c was made by in vitro transcription/translation of the gene and purified to the monomeric, fully reduced form. It was found that in the presence of a wheat germ extract factor there was a high-affinity phase of the uptake into mouse liver mitochondria at 10-300 pM apocytochrome c, and a lower-affinity phase through 4000 pM. Without the factor, the high-affinity phase was absent. The stimulatory effect of the factor could not be elicited with various reductants, such as NADH, FMN, and ferrous protoheme IX. Conversely, when mitochondria loaded with apocytochrome c were resuspended in fresh medium, the protein readily reequilibrated. Successive washings depleted greater than 95% of the associated apoprotein but removed no holoprotein. Proteases (proteinase K or trypsin) added to a suspension of mitochondria loaded with apoprotein digested an amount of apoprotein similar to that which would have been dissociated during the same time, as measured by successive washings in the absence of protease. Mitochondria loaded with apoprotein and similarly treated with protease continued exporting the apoprotein, even after the protease was inhibited and removed, suggesting that most of the apoprotein associated with the organelle was in a protease-resistant compartment. Apocytochrome c mutants in which serines or alanines replaced cysteines 14 and 17, which bind the prosthetic group, behaved like the cysteine-containing protein, indicating that the covalent attachment of the heme is unrelated to the translocation of the apoprotein."

"1716724","abstracttext","Transcription initiation sites on the soybean mitochondrial genome have been characterized by sequence analysis of in vitro-capped soybean mtRNAs and corresponding mtDNA regions. The most abundant, discrete soybean mtRNA species labeled by guanylyltransferase and [alpha-32P]GTP are shown to correspond to the major transcript of the atp9 gene and to a group of small RNAs consisting of a discrete 80 nucleotide (nt) species plus heterogeneous species ranging in size from 133 to 148 nt. The 133-148 nt RNAs represent a set of transcripts with a common 5' terminus and ragged 3' ends, while the 80 nt RNA corresponds to positions 53-133 of the 133 nt species. The major, discrete in vitro-capped RNA species thus correspond to primary transcripts originating at three sites located in two regions of the soybean mitochondrial genome. The sequences extending from 13 nucleotides upstream to 8 nucleotides downstream of the initiation sites for the atp9 and 133-148 nt transcripts are identical at 18 of 21 positions. Sequences closely resembling this motif are located at some other 5' transcript termini of dicot plant mitochondria. Less closely related sequences are found at transcription initiation sites of wheat and maize mitochondria."

"2103453","abstracttext","The nucleotide sequence of a 1 kbp region of pea chloroplast DNA upstream from the gene petA encoding apocytochrome f has been determined. An open reading frame of 231 codons (ORF231) encoding a putative membrane-spanning polypeptide is separated by 205 bp from the coding region of petA. The open reading frame is homologous to open reading frames located in a similar position with respect to petA in chloroplast DNA from Marchantia polymorpha, tobacco, rice, wheat and Vicia faba. The sequence around a conserved histidine residue in a putative membrane-spanning region of the polypeptide resembles sequences present in cytochrome b from chromaffin granules and neutrophil membranes, suggesting that the open reading frame may encode a haem-binding polypeptide, possibly a b-type cytochrome. Northern hybridisation analysis indicates the presence in pea chloroplasts of a complex pattern of transcripts containing ORF231. Large transcripts of 5.5 kb, 4.3 kb, 3.4 kb and 2.7 kb encode both ORF231 and apocytochrome f, indicating that ORF231 and petA are co-transcribed."
"1832669","articletitle","Tetramer of a 21-base pair synthetic element confers seed expression and transcriptional enhancement in response to water stress and abscisic acid."
"1832669","abstracttext","A conserved 21-base pair element, designated as hex-1, located between -180 and -160 of the wheat histone H3 promoter, is known to interact with two tobacco nuclear factors, activating sequence factor 1 and hex-1-specific binding factor. We have shown previously that a mutant sequence (hex-3), which differs from hex-1 by three base pairs, can no longer bind these two factors significantly. In the present work, we examined the functional characteristics of these two sequences in transgenic tobacco. Surprisingly, we found that a tetramer of hex-3, but not of hex-1, confers high level expression in mature seeds. Expression of this synthetic promoter rapidly diminishes upon germination but can be reactivated in young seedlings and mature leaves by desiccation, NaCl, or the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). Treatment with auxin or cytokinin has no apparent effect on the expression. Since the endogenous ABA level of plant cells is known to increase upon water stress, our data suggest that hex-3, the mutated hex-1 sequence, is an abscisic acid-responsive element (abre). We propose that a tobacco nuclear factor, distinct from activating sequence factor 1 and hex-1-specific binding factor, interacts with this sequence and is involved in mediating the effects of ABA and water stress on gene expression."

By using three methylation-sensitive rare-cutter restriction endonucleases, NotI, NruI and MluI, and an alpha-Amy-1 cDNA probe and four gene-specific genomic probes from the alpha-Amy-B1 locus, the size of the alpha-Amy-A1 locus was estimated to be about 700 kb and of the alpha-Amy-B1 locus to be about approximately 4300 kb. These two maps indicate clustering of GC-rich and C-methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme recognition sites. At least five regions reminiscent of 'CpG islands' are apparent in alpha-Amy-B1, and three in alpha-Amy-A1. Correlation between recombination frequency and physical distance within the alpha-Amy-B1 locus suggests that 1 cM approximates to 1 Mb in physical distance."

"1675249","abstracttext","A general diagnostic assay for a number of distinct luteoviruses was developed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme analysis. Two minimally degenerate, group-specific primers were derived from previously published RNA sequences of three luteoviruses. This primer pair generated specific PCR fragments of about 530 bp from extracts of plants infected with potato leafroll virus, beet western yellows virus, or New York barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) serotypes MAV, PAV, RMV, RPV and SGV, which span much of the respective viral coat protein gene. Each virus was easily distinguished from the others by restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified DNA products. Samples from BYDV-infected oat and wheat collected in Nebraska were identified as containing PAV-like serotypes; micro-heterogeneity was detected in several samples. This method provides a rapid, sensitive and relatively inexpensive means of luteovirus detection and identification. It is the first test capable of simultaneously detecting all five BYDV serotypes."

"1651501","abstracttext","How the DNA tumor virus, simian virus 40, reaches the nucleus is unknown. In this report we have tested the affinity of simian virus 40 toward the nucleus by microinjecting virion particles into the cytoplasm under conditions in which cell-surface-mediated viral infection was blocked. Subcellular localization of viral structural proteins Vp1, Vp2, and Vp3, large tumor antigen, and virion particles was followed immunocytochemically and ultrastructurally. Both virion particles and viral structural proteins localized in the nucleus within 1-2 hr after cytoplasmic injection and subsequently expressed large tumor antigen, which was detected in the nucleus as early as 3 hr after cytoplasmic injection. Vp1 and large tumor antigen nuclear accumulation, as well as virion nuclear entry, were blocked by wheat germ agglutinin and an anti-nucleoporin monoclonal antibody, mAb 414. Virion particles were visualized in the vicinity of nuclear pores and in the cytoplasm with this agent. We conclude that virion particles are karyophilic and enter through nuclear pores. This study suggests that virion structural proteins facilitate virion import into the nucleus and viral gene expression."

"1690700","abstracttext","A combination of neuroanatomic techniques was used to examine the origin and neuropeptide content of nerve fibers in the airway epithelium of adult cats. By the use of immunocytochemical methods, the peptides substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) were colocalized in airway epithelial nerve fibers. Two days after wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) was injected into the nodose ganglion, fibers containing WGA immunoreactivity (IR) were detected in the airway epithelium. SP-like immunoreactivity (LI) and CGRP-LI were demonstrated separately in the WGA-IR fibers, establishing their origin from nerve cell bodies of nodose ganglion. Vagal transection inferior to the nodose ganglion reduced the number of SP- and CGRP-IR fibers by greater than 90% in ipsilateral airways. In contralateral airways, SP-IR fibers were substantially reduced, whereas the effect on CGRP-IR fibers was not statistically significant. Vagotomy superior to the nodose ganglion did not alter the density of peptide-IR fibers. The results prove that SP- and CGRP-IR nerve fibers of cat airway epithelium originate from nerve cell bodies in the nodose ganglion and that SP- and CGRP-like peptides may be stored together in some nerve fibers of the airway epithelium."

"1618387","abstracttext","Deletion mutants were produced in a translocated chromosome segment derived from Thinopyrum distichum (Thunb.) Löve. Spikes of the translocation line 'Indis' were irradiated with gamma rays at dosages of 15, 20, and 25 Gy. The irradiated spikes were pollinated with 'Inia 66' pollen and the F2 and F3 generations screened for translocation mutants, using the genes for leaf rust resistance and yellow endosperm pigmentation as markers. Finally, endopeptidase polymorphisms were utilized to select mutant translocation homozygotes within each of 29 families. An investigation of polymorphisms at the alpha-Amy-D2 and Wsp-D1 loci of chromosome arm 7DL revealed that 'Indis' did not produce an alpha-AMY-D2 product, but it did produce a novel WSP-D1 protein. The mutants were characterized for their leaf and stem rust resistances and the presence of WSP-D1 and yellow flour pigments. The stem rust resistance gene could not be accurately mapped. The linear order of the remaining loci on 7DL was centromere - leaf rust resistance - Wsp-D1 and yellow pigment. The data obtained suggested that the 'Indis' translocation has homo(eo)logy to the Lr19 translocation and homoeology to 7DL of common wheat."

"1633495","abstracttext","Although synthesis of the cytosolic maize albumin b-32 had been shown to be controlled by the Opaque-2 regulatory locus, its function was unknown. We show here that b-32 is a member of the large and widely distributed class of toxic plant proteins with ribosome-inactivating activity. These ribosome-inactivating proteins (RIPs) are RNA N-glycosidases that remove a single base from a conserved 28S rRNA loop required for elongation factor 1 alpha binding. Cell-free in vitro translation extracts were used to show that both maize and wheat ribosomes were resistant to molar excesses of b-32 but not to the dicotyledonous RIP gelonin. We extracted RIP activity from kernels during seed maturation and germination. The amount of RIP activity increased during germination, although the amount of b-32 protein remained fairly constant. Expression of a maize RIP gene under the control of an endosperm-specific transcriptional regulatory may be an important clue prompting investigation of the biological basis for RIP expression in seeds of other plants."

"1634524","abstracttext","Ubiquitin-activating enzyme, E1, directs the ATP-dependent formation of a thiol ester linkage between itself and ubiquitin. The energy in this bond is ultimately used to attach ubiquitin to various intracellular proteins. We previously reported the isolation of multiple E1s from wheat and the characterization of a cDNA encoding this protein (UBA1). We now report the derived amino acid sequence of two additional members of this gene family (UBA2 and UBA3). Whereas the amino acid sequence of UBA2 is nearly identical to UBA1, the sequence of UBA3 is significantly different. Nevertheless, the protein encoded by UBA3 catalyzes the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin in vitro. Comparison of derived amino acid sequences of genes encoding E1 from plant, yeast, and animal tissues revealed 5 conserved cysteine residues, with one potentially involved in thiol ester bond formation. To identify this essential residue, codons corresponding to each of the 5 cysteines in UBA1 were individually altered using site-directed mutagenesis. The mutagenized enzymes were expressed in Escherichia coli and assayed for their ability to activate ubiquitin. Only substitution of the cysteine at position 626 abolishes E1 activity, suggesting that this residue forms the thiol ester linkage with ubiquitin."

"1841722","abstracttext","Histone H2A is a component of eukaryotic chromatin whose expression has not been studied in plants. We isolated and characterized a tomato and a pea cDNA encoding histone H2A. We found that in tomato H2A is encoded by a small gene family and that both the pea and the tomato mRNAs are polyadenylated. Tomato H2A has 82% amino acid residue identity to pea H2A, 83% to wheat, and 65% to human and yeast H2A. Plant H2As differ from fungal and animal H2As in their amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal regions. Carboxy-terminal plant H2A regions contain the motif SPKK, a peptide implicated in binding of A/T-rich DNA regions. By using RNA gel blot analysis, we determined that the steady-state mRNA level of these genes was abundant in apices and early developing fruit and very low in mature tissues. In situ RNA hybridization showed strong spatial regulation because the mRNA was abundant in some cells and not detectable in others. In tomato shoot tips, H2A-expressing cells were distributed irregularly in or near meristems. In tomato or pea root tips, expressing cells were concentrated near the apex, and their distribution was consistent with that expected of cycling cells. Other H2A transcripts were found in nondividing cortical cells that are known to undergo endoduplication during the late maturation phase of primary development."

Overlapping Sau3AI clones were identified by a chromosome walk initiated with a clone of C. moewusii mtDNA. The mtDNA map was completed by Southern blot analysis of the C. moewusii mtDNA fraction using isolated mtDNA clones. Regions that hybridized to C. reinhardtii or wheat mitochondrial gene probes for subunit I of cytochrome oxidase (cox1), apocytochrome b (cob), three subunits of NADH dehydrogenase (nad1, nad2 and nad5) and the small and the large ribosomal RNAs (rrnS and rrnL, respectively) were localized on the C. moewusii mtDNA map by Southern blot analysis.

"1764504","abstracttext","The 5'-untranslated leader sequence of potato virus X (PVX) RNA (63 nucleotides apart from cap-structure) consists of two sub-sequences referred to as alpha-sequence (41 nucleotides with no G) and beta-sequence (42 nucleotides upstream from the first AUG). Computer-based folding predictions suggest that the 5'-proximal region of alpha beta-leader is unstructured. The second structural feature of alpha beta-leader is the presence of the sequences apparently complementary to the 3'-terminal region of 18S rRNA. The alpha beta-leader has been shown to strongly enhance the translation of the contiguous foreign gene (NPT1) transcripts in cell-free translation systems from rabbit reticulocytes (RRL), wheat germ (WG) and Krebs-2 ascite cell extract (KA). In competitive translation PVX, RNA strongly inhibited tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA, in RRL and WG systems. No competition occurred between PVX and TMV RNAs in KA system. There was no correlation between the translational efficiency and competitive ability of PVX RNA in different cell-free translation systems. The competitive ability did not solely depend on the presence of alpha beta-leader in mRNA. We present evidence to suggest that alpha beta-leader together with about 150 bases of the coding sequence is responsible for the translation competitive ability of PVX RNA."

"7069515","abstracttext","The influence of a 7.7-mumole (0.5-mg) dose of parenteral zinc on the synthesis of metallothionein in rat kidney was examined. The amount of zinc bound to metallothionein was maximal 9--15 hours after zinc administration. Pulse labeling with [35S]cystine showed the rate of renal metallothionein was stimulated to a maximum 6 hours after zinc administration and declined thereafter. Total RNA was extracted by the guanidine thiocyanate procedure from kidneys that had been flash frozen in liquid N2. Polyadenylated RNA (mRNA) was isolated by oligo (dT)-cellulose chromatography. The mRNA was translated in a wheat germ system and newly synthesized metallothionein was isolated by activated thiol--Sepharose 4B chromatography. Metallothionein mRNA activity nearly doubled after zinc administration adn was closely correlated with the enhancement in synthetic rate of this protein in kidney. Actinomycin D administered prior to either zinc or cadmium completely blocked both the stimulation of metallothionein synthesis and mRNA activity found in kidney in response to these metals. The results suggest renal metallothionein is induced by zinc or cadmium through a mechanism that requires altered expression of the metallothionein gene(s)."

"3040720","abstracttext","The initiator AUC of the mouse dihydrofolate reductase gene (dhfr) was converted to ACG by site-directed mutagenesis and assayed for expression in cultured monkey cells using an SV40 recombinant called SVGT5dhfr26m2. Synthesis of apparently full-length dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) protein was significantly reduced compared to wild-type, but not entirely abolished, suggesting that the ACG triplet was being utilized for translation initiation. In addition, a truncated form of DHFR was produced, apparently by initiation at the next in-frame AUG downstream. This result was confirmed in vitro. Transcripts of the dhfr sequence were produced by SP6 RNA polymerase in the presence of m7GpppG and translated in vitro using reticulocyte lysates and wheat germ extracts. The results paralleled those observed in vivo. Synthesis of full-length DHFR was reduced, but not eliminated, and a new species was produced by initiation at an internal site. Amino acid sequence analysis of the products of in vitro translation demonstrated that translation does indeed initiate at the ACG triplet and that it initiates with methionine. Additional mutations were introduced which altered the sequence context of the ACG triplet. Mutation of the translation initiation consensus sequence by substitution of the A residue at position -3, or of the G at +4 resulted in a significant decrease in initiation at the ACG and an increase in the level of the internal initiation product. Thus, translation initiation at a non-AUG triplet depends on a favorable sequence context."

"3121325","abstracttext","The genes for the large and small subunits of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) from Anacystis nidulans have been expressed in Escherichia coli under the control of the lac promoter to produce active enzyme. The enzyme can be purified from the cells to yield up to 200 mg Rubisco/l cultured bacteria, and is indistinguishable from the enzyme extracted from A. nidulans. In order to investigate the role of the N-terminus of the large subunit in catalysis, chimaeric genes were constructed where the DNA coding for the 12 N-terminal amino acids in A. nidulans was replaced by DNA encoding the equivalent, but poorly conserved, region of either the wheat or maize large subunit. These genes, in constructs also containing the gene for the A. nidulans small subunit, were expressed in E. coli and produced enzymes with similar catalytic properties to the wild-type Rubisco of A. nidulans. In contrast, when the N-terminal region of the large subunit was replaced by unrelated amino acids encoded by the pUC8 polylinker, enzyme activity of the expressed protein was reduced by 90% under standard assay conditions, due to an approximately tenfold rise in the Km for ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. This confirms that the N-terminus of the large subunit has a function in catalysis, either directly in substrate binding or in maintaining the integrity of the active site."

"3436948","abstracttext","We have cloned a full length cDNA for the small subunit of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase from C4 monocot maize, determined the complete nucleotide sequence of this cDNA and deduced its amino acid sequence. The cDNA insert included 513 bp of the coding region, and 65 and 252 nucleotides of the 5' and 3' untranslated regions, respectively. The transit and mature peptides have, respectively, 47 and 123 amino acids. Comparison with the small subunit genes from other plants revealed that the maize small subunit is similar to the wheat one, there being 73% homology between the transit peptides and 64% between the mature proteins. This indicates that there is no noteworthy difference between the C3 and C4 small subunit structures. Extreme codon bias was observed for this gene, and similar codon preferences are observed for other proteins highly expressed in maize leaf, light harvesting chlorophyll binding protein and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. The results indicate that preferential codon usage for highly expressed genes occurs in maize leaf."

"3517385","abstracttext","Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles are secreted by Chinese hamster ovary cells that are stably transfected with the S gene of hepatitis B virus. The assembly of HBsAg into cylindrical and spherical particles occurred intracellularly within the endoplasmic reticulum. HBsAg particles accumulated within large dilated areas of the endoplasmic reticulum and remained within these structures for most of the time prior to secretion from the cells. Once the particles were formed, the HBsAg polypeptides did not appear to become associated with subsequent intracellular organelle membranes or the plasma membrane. HBsAg within the dilated structures did not bind wheat germ agglutinin, indicating that its oligosaccharide chains had not yet been processed to the complex form (containing terminal sialic acid-N-acetylglucosamine residues). The oligosaccharide chains of HBsAg are processed to the complex form and can be detected on the HBsAg after secretion, but this event was not detected within cells. In addition, HBsAg was not observed on the cell surface by indirect immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation, although immunoelectron microscopy revealed some staining at or near the cell surface. These results suggested that HBsAg was either secreted from cells without being incorporated into the plasma membrane, or that the levels of HBsAg in the plasma membrane were below the limits of detection."

"7845424","abstracttext","There is significant clinical interest in primers which are specific for fungi and do not hybridize to DNA of other eukaryotes or prokaryotes. Such primers would allow specific amplification of fungal DNA from human tissue samples containing fungi. Fungal identification to the species level could follow by direct sequencing or restriction analysis. Several previously described primer systems cross-react with DNA of plants and animals. We have designed a primer system that amplifies a fragment of the gene coding for the small ribosomal subunit 18S rRNA. Database searches and sequence analyses were performed using the HUSAR (Heidelberg Unix Sequence Analysis Resources) computer system at the German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany. Primers TR1 (5'-GTTTCTAGGACCGCCGTA) and TR2 (5'-CTCAAACTTCCATCGACTTG) bind to sequences which are homologous within the fungi, but differ from corresponding DNA fragments of plants and animals. The amplified fragment is 581 base pairs in length and contains variable, and therefore species-specific, regions. The DNA of Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton verrucosum, Trichophyton terrestre, Microsporum canis, Microsporum gypseum and Epidermophyton floccosum and of several yeast species was amplified by the primers, but not the DNA from 42 normal human skin samples. Furthermore, other DNA preparations from plants and animals, including those from radish, cabbage, wheat and mouse, did not show amplification reactions."

The purification factor was 838 and the final specific activity was 1.3 nkat.(mg protein)-1. On denaturing gels the major polypeptide was 120 kDa but there was also a variable amount of smaller polypeptides in the range of 90 to 110 kDa. A new activity stain was developed to allow visualization of SPS in gels. The holoenzyme had a molecular weight of about 240 and 480 kDa in native gels and Sepharose, respectively. A high-titre polyclonal antibody was obtained which reacted with SPS from other species including wheat, potato, banana and maize. Screening of a spinach-leaf cDNA-expression library with the antibody allowed the isolation of a full-length clone. Sequencing revealed a predicted molecular weight of 117649 Da, and considerable homology with the recently published sequence for maize leaf (Worrell et al. 1991, Plant Cell 3, 1121-1130). Expression of the spinach-leaf SPS gene in Escherichia coli resulted in biological activity, revealed by the presence of SPS activity in extracts and the accumulation of sucrose-6-phosphate and sucrose in the bacteria."

Analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence of cotton PSII-T revealed the presence of potential chloroplast stroma and thylakoid targeting domains and a putative mature PSII protein of 3.0 kDa, composed of only 28 amino acid residues. The cotton PSII-T 11-kDa precursor was synthesized in vitro in a wheat germ extract translation system, and the translation product was used in assays for protein imports into isolated pea chloroplasts. It was shown that the cotton PSII-T precursor was imported into the chloroplasts, processed to a mature form of approximately 3.0 kDa, agreeing with the predicted size from amino acid sequence analysis, and localized to the lumenal side of the thylakoid membrane, thus defining a new nuclear encoded lumenal protein and the smallest polypeptide of PSII reported to date. Processing of the PSII-T precursor occurred in two steps and involved the formation of a stromal intermediate of approximately 7.5 kDa, as predicted from primary structure analysis."

"8012652","abstracttext","The human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, exhibits an array of stable properties in culture that have made it a popular cell culture model for studies on regulation of liver-specific gene expression and properties of hepatoma cells. In contrast to other hepatoma cell lines, HepG2 cells overexpress a characteristic detergent-extractable, wheat germ lectin-binding protein with apparent molecular mass of 130 kDa. Using an antibody to screen a phage expression library of HepG2 complementary DNA (cDNA), we identified and cloned a 4734 base pair cDNA which codes for a 130-kDa leucine-rich protein (lrp 130) when expressed in transfected cells. The deduced sequence of lrp130 exhibits sequences weakly homologous to the consensus sequence for the ATP binding site in ATP-dependent kinases and the protein kinase C phosphorylation site of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Consistent with the higher levels of expression of lrp130 antigen, Northern hybridization analysis indicated that HepG2 cells express high levels of the major 4.8 kilobase lrp130 mRNA relative to other hepatoma cells. Although currently of unknown function, lrp130 may be of utility as a marker for liver cell lineages represented by the HepG2 cell line."

The sequence was found to be homologous to that of the nuclear-encoded 49 kDa complex I subunit of bovine and Neurospora mitochondria and to the sequence deduced from the mitochondrial nad7 gene identified in the mitochondrial (mt) DNA of tryp anosomes and the moss Marchantia. An oligonucleotide probe derived from the potato N-terminal protein sequence hybridized only to the plant mtDNA. Immunoprecipitation of in-organello 35S-labelled potato and wheat mitochondrial translation products with an antibody directed against the Neurospora 49 kDa complex I subunit indicates that at least in these plants the NAD7 protein is synthesized within the organelle. Comparisons of genomic, cDNA and protein sequences of the 5' coding region reveal three codons that are changed by RNA-editing and confirm translation of the edited transcripts in plant mitochondria. The NAD7 protein appears to undergo post-translational processing since the N-terminal methionine residue is absent from the mature mitochondrial protein."

"7768947","abstracttext","An infectious, in vitro transcript from a full-length cDNA clone of the barley yellow dwarf virus (PAV serotype) genome translated efficiently in a wheat germ translation extract. Deletions in a region that we call the 3' translational enhancer, located between bases 4,513 and 5,009 in the 5,677-base genome, reduced translation of the 5'-proximal open reading frames from uncapped RNA by at least 30-fold. Deletions elsewhere in all but the 5' end of the genome had no effect on translation. Presence of a m7G(5')pp(5')G cap on the 5' end fully restored translational efficiency of transcripts lacking the 3' translational enhancer. The translation enhancer reduced inhibition of translation by free cap analog, did not affect RNA stability, and did not function in reticulocyte lysates. When placed in the 3'-untranslated region of uncapped mRNA encoding the beta-glucuronidase gene, the translation enhancer stimulated translation more than 80-fold, in the presence of the viral, but not a plasmid-derived, 5' leader. A polyadenylate tail could not substitute for the 3' translation enhancer. These observations provide an extreme example, in terms of distance from the 5' end and level of stimulation, of an mRNA in which a sequence near the 3' end stimulates translation."

"6607473","abstracttext","A hybrid gene containing 182 codons of Escherichia coli beta-lactamase at the amino terminus of the corresponding protein and 141 codons of alpha-globin at the carboxyl terminus was generated by inserting chimpanzee alpha-globin cDNA into the Pst I site of plasmid pBR322. RNA transcribed in vitro from this plasmid gave a corresponding hybrid protein in a wheat germ cell-free translation system. The hybrid protein was protected from tryptic digestion and the pre-beta-lactamase signal peptide was removed when dog pancreas membrane vesicles were present during translation. A deletion mutant containing 23 codons of pre-beta-lactamase signal sequence and 5 codons of mature beta-lactamase fused to the alpha-globin cDNA gave a shorter hybrid protein that behaved similarly. However, a mutation that removed essentially all of the pre-beta-lactamase sequence gave a protein that was neither protected nor processed. Hence, at most, only the signal peptide and the first 5 amino acids of beta-lactamase were necessary to convert alpha-globin (a cytoplasmic protein) into a secretory protein."

Electrophoretic heterogeneity was not detected for messengers for histones H2A and H3. Histone mRNA, purified by hybridization under stringent conditions with a cloned histone gene cluster, was used to direct histone protein synthesis in a wheat-germ cell free system. The proteins synthesized comigrate with purified marker histones when electrophoresed on SDS-gels or acid-urea gels containing Triton X-100. When hybrid-selected histone mRNAs from oocytes and embryos in different developmental stages are translated, the proteins made by the mRNA from one stage can not be discriminated from those made by the mRNA from another stage after electrophoresis on SDS-gels or acid urea Triton X-100 gels."

"6223209","abstracttext","Growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell cycle mutants cdc3, cdc4, cdc7, cdc24, and cdc28 at a nonpermissive temperature (37 degrees C) resulted in increased accumulation of chitin relative to other cell wall components, as compared with that observed at a permissive temperature (25 degrees C). Wild-type cells showed the same chitin/carbohydrate ratio at both temperatures, whereas mutants cdc13 and cdc21 yielded only a small increase in the ratio at 37 degrees C. These results confirm and extend those reported by B. F. Sloat and J. R. Pringle (Science 200:1171-1173, 1978) for mutant cdc24. The distribution of chitin in the cell wall was studied by electron microscopy, by specific staining with wheat germ agglutinin-colloidal gold complexes. At the permissive temperature, chitin was restricted to the septal region in all strains, whereas at 37 degrees C a generalized distribution of chitin in the cell wall was observed in all mutants. These results do not support a unique interdependence between the product of the cdc24 gene and localization of chitin deposition; they suggest that unbalanced conditions created in the cell by arresting the cycle at different stages result in generalized activation of the chitin synthetase zymogen. Thus, blockage of an event in the cell cycle may lead to consequences that are not functionally related to that event under normal conditions."

The respective gene frequencies were calculated to be .073, .011, .561, and .355 for A-, B-, C-, D-type GPIb. Portions from each type of GPIb molecule (alpha-chain and glycocalicin) showed heterogeneity with the same molecular weight difference, indicating that the variance would be derived from the polypeptide portion that is exposed to the outer medium. The different types of GPIb were the same with respect to their accessibility to lactoperoxidase, reactivity to lectins, and affinity to TLCK-thrombin. Although Bolin et al reported patients with a bleeding tendency whose platelets have double GPIb bands, here we found that platelets with different GPIb phenotypes showed no significant differences in aggregating activity and platelet retention. Analysis of GPIb phenotype should be important for structural and physiologic studies on GPIb and glycocalicin."

The transcription terminators comprise 14-17 A.T bp immediately preceded by a region of weak dyad symmetry. The spacer regions adjacent to the transcription terminators in the two different size repeat units have interspersed oligonucleotides of high and low homology. The central spacer regions of the two size classes have very different sequences. The only repeated sequence in the spacers has undergone extensive divergence. In contrast to most of the spacer, the 70 bp region preceding the genes of each type of repeat show high homology, suggesting that it has functional importance.

In the CVN, a few medium sized cell clusters at a level caudal to the nodose ganglion, and some small cell clusters along the course of the vagus, were found. In the SLN and RLN, some medium sized ganglia were located close to the laryngeal framework and a few small groups of cells occupied more rostral parts. Some neurons of the cell clusters in the CVN and most of the ganglionic cells in the SLN and RLN exhibited WGA-immunoreactive (IR) cells, which projected to the larynx. In these WGA-positive ganglionic neurons, many cells showed vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-IR neurons, some neuropeptide Y-IR, and a few substance P-IR and calcitonin gene-related peptide-IR cells were also identified. The present findings indicate that neurons of the cell clusters in the laryngeal nerves, particularly those in the vicinity of the laryngeal framework, project to the larynx and may be autonomic."

"7593258","abstracttext","The proximal promoter of the human H4 histone gene FO108 contains two regions of in vivo protein-DNA interaction, Sites I and II. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using a radiolabeled DNA probe revealed that several proteins present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts bound specifically to Site I (nt-125 to nt-86). The most prominent complex, designated HiNF-C, and a complex of greater mobility, HiNF-C', were specifically compatable by an Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide. Fractionation of HiNF-C using wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography suggested that, like Sp1, HiNF-C contains N-acetylglucosamine moieties. Two minor complexes of even greater mobility, designated HiNF-E and F, were compatable by ATF consensus oligonucleotides. A DNA probe carrying a site-specific mutation in the distal portion of Site I failed to bind HiNF-E, indicating that this protein associated specifically to this region. UV cross-linking analysis showed that several proteins of different molecular weights interact specifically with Site I. These data indicate that Site I possesses a bipartite structure and that multiple proteins present in HeLa cell nuclear extracts interact specifically with Site I sequences."

The two major circulating ALP isoenzymes, bone and liver, are difficult to distinguish because they are the products of a single gene and differ only by posttranslational glycosylation. Quantitative measurement of bone ALP (BAP) activity in serum can provide an index for the rate of bone formation. Furthermore, increased BAP activity in serum is indicative of bone disorders. We describe a method in which serum samples are added to a microtiter plate coated with monoclonal anti-BAP antibody and incubated 3 h at room temperature. After the unbound materials are washed off, the bound BAP activity is measured by adding p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate. The assay demonstrated no cross-reactivity to intestinal or placental ALP and only 3-8% cross-reactivity to liver ALP. The intraassay (n = 21) CVs were 3.9-5.9%, and interassay (n = 8) CVs were 4.4-7.0%. Comparisons of the assay (y) with an IRMA (x) and a wheat germ agglutinin precipitation method (x') gave regression equations of y = 1.32x-6.4, r = 0.99, and y = 1.41x' + 4.8, r = 0.99.

We established an in vitro system to assay and to dissect the process of wheat mitochondrial mRNA editing. A deamination mechanism explains most easily the observed C to U transitions. Several fractions of organellar protein participate in the editing machinery. Some of these proteins presumably carry the catalytic activity while others are typical RNA binding proteins and may confer specificity to the 'editosome' complex. To investigate the functional properties of protein products synthesized from unedited mRNAs, we constructed transgenic tobacco plants carrying an unedited gene coding for subunit 9 (ATP9) of the ATP synthase complex. The nuclear encoded 'unedited' protein product is targeted to the mitochondria with a heterologous presequence. A significant number of male sterile tobacco plants were obtained suggesting that at least the functional ATP9 protein requires RNA editing. This result suggests a novel approach to obtain artificial male sterile plants by using a physiological effect resulting in CMS which mimics the situation found in many natural populations."

After WGA-HRP injection, the cervico-thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were removed and processed using both HRP histochemistry and CGRP immunohistochemistry. In the C4 to C7 DRG, small to medium-sized neurons (20-40 microns) were labeled by this combined method. The number and size of the labeled neurons were measured in the cervical 4th-7th DRG. The number of double-labeled neurons was one quarter of the total number of HRP-labeled neurons and 1/20 of the CGRP-IR neurons. Most of the double-labeled cells were located in the C6 ganglion, and the mean number of double-labeled neurons was 13 at this level. This distribution and function of the CGRP-IR fibers in the rat shoulder joint capsule are discussed."

"7629047","abstracttext","The overexpression of the P-glycoprotein, the MDR1 gene product, has been linked to the development of resistance to multiple cytotoxic natural product anticancer drugs in certain cancers and cell lines derived from tumors. P-glycoprotein, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily of transporters, is believed to function as an ATP-dependent drug efflux pump with broad specificity for chemically unrelated hydrophobic compounds. We review here recent studies on the purification and reconstitution of P-glycoprotein to elucidate the mechanism of drug transport. P-glycoprotein from the human carcinoma multidrug resistant cell line, KB-V1, was purified by sequential chromatography on anion exchange followed by a lectin (wheat germ agglutinin) column. Proteoliposomes reconstituted with pure protein exhibited high levels of drug-stimulated ATPase activity as well as ATP-dependent [3H]vinblastine accumulation. Both the ATPase and vinblastine transport activities of the reconstituted P-glycoprotein were inhibited by vanadate. In addition, the vinblastine transport was inhibited by verapamil and daunorubicin. These studies provide strong evidence that the human P-glycoprotein functions as an ATP-dependent drug transporter. The development of the reconstitution system and the availability of recombinant protein in large amounts due to recent advances in overexpression of P-glycoprotein in a heterologous expression system should facilitate a better understanding of the function of this novel protein."
"7670545","articletitle","Differential turn-over of beta-tubulin during the cell differentiation of Trypanosoma cruzi."
"7670545","abstracttext","We investigated the expression of beta-tubulin during the differentiation of non-infective epimastigotes to infective metacyclics of Trypanosoma cruzi to underlay some of the regulatory mechanisms of the gene expression in this pathogenic parasite. Given the strong evolutionary conservation of tubulin, it was possible to study its translational and transcriptional products with heterologous probes. Quantitative Western blotting with specific monoclonal antibodies against beta-tubulin revealed an increase in the relative amounts of this protein in metacyclics with respect to epimastigotes. Pulse-chase experiments with radioactive methionine followed by immunoprecipitation and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that beta-tubulin has a slower degradation in metacyclics, which may contribute to its relative higher abundance in these parasite forms. In contrast with these results, both in vitro translation of poly (A+) mRNA in a wheat germ system and Northern blots of total and poly (A+) mRNA with a heterologous DNA probe from Leishmania enriettii, revealed a significant decrease (5 fold) in the specific transcripts of beta-tubulin in the metacyclics with respect to epimastigotes. It thus appeared that after differentiation of T. cruzi the translational machinery for a key protein such as beta-tubulin is shut off by a decrease in its specific message. The protein levels of this protein are maintained, however, by a compensatory mechanism that involves a slower turn-over of the synthesized protein."
"7657666","articletitle","The B isoform of the insulin receptor signals more efficiently than the A isoform in HepG2 cells."
"7657666","abstracttext","We have demonstrated previously that dexamethasone treatment of HepG2 cells caused an enhancement of insulin's metabolic effects (Kosaki, A., and Webster, N. J. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 21990-21996). This correlated with increased expression of the mRNA encoding the B isoform of the insulin receptor (IR). In the present study, we have demonstrated that dexamethasone treatment caused in addition an enhancement in insulin-stimulated immediate-early gene expression (c-fos and egr-1). Dexamethasone treatment caused an increase in in vivo IR autophosphorylation and insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) phosphorylation both early events in the insulin signaling pathway. Furthermore, the IRS-1 phosphorylation was distinctly left shifted, although the level of IRS-1 protein was unchanged. Total cellular tyrosine phosphatase activity was unaltered when assayed with 32P-labeled IR and IRS-1. Studies in vitro on wheat-germ agglutinin-purified receptors showed that the B isoform of the IR had increased kinase activity both toward itself and the exogenous substrates poly.glu4:tyr1 and recombinant IRS-1 protein. In addition, two-dimensional tryptic phosphopeptide maps indicated that the B isoform has an additional phosphopeptide that is not seen for the A isoform. In conclusion, it appears that the B isoform of the IR signals more efficiently than the A isoform in HepG2 cells."

"8253772","abstracttext","A rat brain opioid receptor protein was isolated by binding [epsilon-biotinyl-Lys32] beta-endorphin to membranes, solubilizing the receptor-ligand (R.L) complex with deoxycholate-lysophosphatidylcholine and purifying on immobilized streptavidin and wheat germ agglutinin. The purified glycoprotein had a molecular mass of 60-70 kDa. Recovery of this protein was blocked by the nonselective opioid antagonist naloxone and the highly mu-selective agonist [D-Ala2,N-methyl-Phe4,Glyol5]-enkephalin but not by the highly delta-selective agonist [D-Pen2,4'-Cl-Phe4,D-Pen5]enkephalin when these compounds were added as competitors at the binding step. The 60-70-kDa receptor protein co-purified through the streptavidin column with 40-kDa protein recognized by anti-Gi alpha antibodies. GTP and Na+ influenced dissociation of the solubilized R.125I-L complex and elution of the receptor and G protein from streptavidin in fashions consistent with the pharmacology of mu-opioid receptors. A 23-amino acid residue sequence from the purified receptor differs at 4 positions from a similar sequence in the murine delta-opioid receptor and is encoded within a novel rat brain cDNA isolated by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers related to the murine delta-opioid receptor gene."

"8431958","abstracttext","The distribution of structural rearrangements of the chloroplast genome found in grass cpDNA in comparison to that of tobacco was systematically checked in the cpDNAs of representative monocots. The physical map of lily cpDNA, which shares a key position in the diversity of monocotyledonous plants, was constructed to assess whether three inversions found in grass cpDNA are common in monocots. Specific probes for the detection of (1) intron loss in the rpoC1 gene, (2) insertional sequence gain in rpoC2, (3) deletion of ORF2280 in the inverted repeats, (4) non-reciprocal translocation of rpl23, and (5) rearrangements of ORF512, were hybridized to cpDNAs of lily, onion, spiderwort, two turf grasses, and wheat. The existence of intervening sequences in the rpoC1 and rpoC2 genes was also confirmed by PCR analysis. All markers used in the study revealed that structural rearrangements of the chloroplast genome were restricted to grasses, indicating that drastic structural alterations of the chloroplast genome had occurred in the ancestor(s) of grasses. These results also suggest that structural analysis of the chloroplast genome is applicable to the phylogenetic reconstruction of related plants."

"8463266","abstracttext","A procedure has been established for the isolation of intact and import-competent glyoxysomes from the cotyledons of sunflower (Helianthus annuus) seedlings. Radiolabeled isocitrate lyase (a glyoxysomal matrix protein) was produced by in vitro transcription of the castor bean cDNA and translation of the RNA in a wheat germ lysate. The heterologous isocitrate lyase was imported into isolated sunflower glyoxysomes and protease-protected. Dihydrofolate reductase, a cytoplasmic protein, neither bound to nor imported into the glyoxysomes. Import of isocitrate lyase was not observed when the glyoxysome fraction was replaced by a mitochondrial fraction. The import of isocitrate lyase into glyoxysomes was temperature- and ATP-dependent. Progressive carboxyl-terminal truncations of the isocitrate lyase gene were transcribed and translated to yield polypeptides with the same amino terminus but lacking varying amounts of the carboxyl terminus. All these polypeptides imported with the same characteristics as the full-length protein, suggesting that targeting information must be present within the first 168 amino acids, and, unlike some other peroxisomal proteins, the carboxyl terminus is dispensable for targeting and import."

"8479904","abstracttext","Metal regulatory elements (MREs) shared by metallothionein (MT) gene promoters are essential for metal induction of MT genes. MEP-1, a nuclear protein which binds to these elements has been purified from heavy metal-resistant mouse L cells using footprinting, Southwestern and UV cross-linking techniques to assay its binding activity. The purification scheme, starting from crude nuclear extracts, involved a combination of heparin-Sepharose and MRE-DNA affinity chromatography. The purified protein preparation showed a single polypeptide band of 108 kDa on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and 2D-gel analyses revealed the presence of a protein species migrating as a single population of approximately 110 kDa. MEP-1 does not appear to be glycosylated since it eluted with the flow-through on a Wheat Germ Sepharose column. It was retained by a zinc-Chelating Sepharose column suggesting that amino acid residues (i.e., cysteine, histidine) which have an affinity for zinc ions are exposed on the protein surface. Binding studies with the purified protein indicated that it binds specifically to MRE sequences and that the binding can be abolished by a point mutation in the MRE core consensus sequence or by the addition of the chelating agent 1,10-phenanthroline. Binding activity can be restored by the addition of zinc ions to the chelated protein. These results suggest that MEP-1 is one of the major proteins interacting with MRE sequences."

"8536986","abstracttext","Correspondence among QTLs affecting height and/or flowering was investigated across the five races of sorghum, an interspecific sorghum F2 population, and 32 previously published sorghum, maize, rice, wheat, and barley populations revealing 185 QTLs or discrete mutants. Among nine QTLs mapped in the interspecific sorghum population (six affecting height and three affecting flowering), at least seven (78%) are associated with ""conversion,"" backcross-introgression of alleles imparting reduced height or earlier flowering from cultivated sorghums into one or more exotic Sorghum bicolor races. One chromosomal region was ""converted"" in all S. bicolar races--in the interspecific F2, this region explained 54.8% of height variation (putatively the Dw2 gene) and 85.7% of flowering time variation (putatively Ma1). Comparative data suggest that Ma1 and Dw2 orthologs influence height and flowering of other Poaceae taxa and support classical dogma that the sorghum phenotypes attributed to Ma1 and Dw2 (respectively) are due to different genetic loci. Other sorghum QTLs also showed correspondence with those in other Poaceae, more frequently than would be expected by chance. Possible homoeologous QTLs were found within both the maize and sorghum genomes. Comparative QTL mapping provides a means to unify, and thereby simplify, molecular analysis of complex phenotypes."

"8589631","abstracttext","The relationship between promoter sequences that mediate Viviparous1 (VP1) transactivation and regulation by abscisic acid (ABA) in the wheat Em promoter was investigated using deletion analysis and directed mutagenesis. The Em1a G-box is strongly coupled to VP1 transactivation as well as to ABA regulation; however, the Em promoter includes additional components that can support VP1 transactivation without ABA responsiveness or synergism. Oligonucleotide tetramers of several G-box sequences, including Em1a, Em1b, and the dyad G-box element from the UV light-regulated parsley chalcone synthase gene, were sufficient to confer VP1 transactivation and the synergistic interaction with ABA to the -45 cauliflower mosaic virus 35S core promoter. These data suggest that VP1 can activate transcription through at least two classes of cis-acting sequences, including the G-box elements and the Sph regulatory motif found in the C1 promoter. The contrasting roles of these motifs in the Em and C1 promoters suggest a basis for the differential regulation of the corresponding genes by VP1."
"8146158","articletitle","Light and nutritional regulation of transcripts encoding a wheat protein kinase homolog is mediated by cytokinins."
"8146158","abstracttext","Many metabolic processes in plants are regulated by phosphorylation of proteins by kinases, but little is known of the roles that specific protein kinase play in the various signal transduction pathways or the mechanisms by which these kinases themselves are regulated. We report here the isolation of a gene, wpk4, encoding a putative protein kinase from wheat that appears to belong to the SNF1 kinase subfamily and that shows increased transcript levels in response to multiple stimuli: light, nutrient deprivation, and cytokinin application. Although wpk4 mRNA is undetectable in etiolated seedlings, it rapidly accumulates within 1 hr of illumination. General nutrient deprivation also increases wpk4 mRNA levels, but only under light conditions. In addition, of the various phytohormones tested, cytokinin (N6-benzylaminopurine) specifically increases wpk4 mRNA levels regardless of the light conditions, whereas in the presence of a cytokinin antagonist the level of wpk4 mRNA is not increased by either light or nutrient deprivation. These results suggest that the light and nutrient signals that induce wpk4 mRNA accumulation may be mediated through cytokinins and provide a strong basis for examining the coordinated regulation of protein phosphorylation by light, cytokinins, and nutritional cues in a single transduction pathway."

The deduced amino acid sequence of BTAI-CMb corresponds to the CM16/CM17 type of subunit in wheat (92/90% identical residues) and has one putative N-glycosylation site (NLT) and a possible kinase-C phosphorylation site (SCR). The BTAI-CMa sequence differs at four amino acid residues from a previously reported one from cv. Bomi and the sequence deduced for BTAI-CMd completes (11 N-terminal residues) and confirms previously available data. The gene for BTAI-CMa (Iat1) is located in the beta arm of barley chromosome 7H (syn.1), while genes for both BTAI-CMb (Iat2) and BTAI-CMd (Iat3) are in the long arm of chromosome 4H. The three genes are expressed in endosperm and their mRNAs are not detected in the other tissues tested, except Iat1, which seems to be expressed at a low level in coleoptile and roots, where it is switched off by 50 microM methyl jasmonate."

"8639742","abstracttext","The C2H2 TFIIIA/Krüppel class of zinc finger proteins are an important group of regulatory nucleic acid binding factors and have been extensively studied in humans, Drosophila and yeast. We have employed 3' RACE PCR, using a highly degenerate oligonucleotide primer, for the facile isolation of a C2H2 zinc finger protein cDNA (Pszf1) from pea petals. The Pszf1 cDNA open reading frame potentially encodes a protein with two widely separated zinc fingers similar to zinc finger proteins from petunia and wheat. This class of two-fingered zinc finger proteins, possessing a wide and variable linker sequence, appears to be unique to plants. Three regions outside the zinc finger domains are also conserved between the members of the plant zinc finger protein family and one of these regions is a candidate nuclear localisation signal. The Pszf1 amino acid sequence is most similar to that of the petunia Epf1 protein, they possess an interfinger linker sequence of approximately the same length and they have a similar expression pattern with maximal transcript accumulation in mature petals, suggesting that Pszf1 may be the pea homologue of the petunia Epf1 zinc finger gene."

"8758979","abstracttext","Benzothiadiazole (BTH) is a novel chemical activator of disease resistance in tobacco, wheat and other important agricultural plants. In this report, it is shown that BTH works by activating SAR in Arabidopsis thaliana. BTH-treated plants were resistant to infection by turnip crinkle virus, Pseudomonas syringae pv 'tomato' DC3000 and Peronospora parasitica. Chemical treatment induced accumulation of mRNAs from the SAR-associated genes, PR-1, PR-2 and PR-5. BTH treatment induced both PR-1 mRNA accumulation and resistance against P. parasitica in the ethylene response mutants, etr1 and ein2, and in the methyl jasmonate-insensitive mutant, jar1, suggesting that BTH action is independent of these plant hormones. BTH treatment also induced both PR-1 mRNA accumulation and P. parasitica resistance in transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing the nahG gene, suggesting that BTH action does not require salicylic acid accumulation. However, because BTH-treatment failed to induce either PR-1 mRNA accumulation or P. parasitica resistance in the non-inducible immunity mutant, nim1, it appears that BTH activates the SAR signal transduction pathway."

"8811098","abstracttext","We have recently identified chloroplast and cytoplasmic tRNACmCATrp as the first natural UGA suppressor tRNAs in plants. The interaction of these tRNAs with UGA involves a Cm: A mismatch at the first anticodon position. We show here that tRNACmCATrp is incapable of misreading UAA and UAG codons in vitro, implying that unconventional base pairs are not tolerated in the middle anticodon position. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ability of tRNACmCATrp to promote UGA read-through depends on a quite simple codon context. Part of the sequence surrounding the leaky UGA stop codon in tobacco rattle virus RNA-1 was subcloned into a zein reporter gene and read-through efficiency was measured by translation of RNA transcripts in wheat germ extract. A number of mutations in the codons adjacent to the UGA were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. It was found that single nucleotide exchanges at either side of the UGA had little effect on read-through efficiency. A pronounced influence on suppression by tRNACmCATrp was seen only if 2 or 3 nt at the 3'-side of the UGA codon had been simultaneously replaced. As a consequence of the flexible codon context accepted by tRNACmCATrp, this tRNA is able to misread the UGA in a number of plant and animal viral RNAs that use translational read-through for expression of some of their genes."

The full-length cDNA consisted of 1218 nucleotides with an open reading frame of 906 bp. The deduced amino acid sequence of CA-SRI protein showed varying homology (ranging from 11 to 54%) to the ribosome inactivating proteins (RIPs) from other plant species. CA-SRI inhibited in vitro protein synthesis both in rabbit reticulocyte lysate and wheat germ lysate but not in Escherichia coli in vitro translation system. The CA-SRI open reading frame was expressed in an E. coli expression vector and the purified recombinant protein inhibited protein synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Southern blot analysis indicated that the CA-SRI gene may be present in low copy number."

"8374617","abstracttext","Ocs-elements, a family of 20 bp DNA sequences, are components of a number of promoters active in plants. In the maize BMS cell line the dominant ocs-element binding activity is the ocs-element transcription factor complex called OTF. The isolation of cDNA clones from a BMS cDNA expression library for two bZIP (basic region-leucine zipper) proteins that bind the ocs-element sequence and are good candidates for forming at least part of OTF is described. The two ocs-element binding proteins, called OBF3.1 and OBF3.2, are closely related, with the OBF3.1 protein sharing 95.8% amino acid homology with part of the OBF3.2 protein although there were significant differences in the 3' untranslated regions. Genomic Southern blot analysis revealed a small gene family with a minimum of two OBF3 loci mapping to chromosomes 3L105 and 8L075. The OBF3.1 protein shared considerable homology with the wheat HBP1b protein (80% amino acid identity) and to a lesser extent with the tobacco TGA1aa protein. OBF3.1 like HBP1b was able to bind well to the Hex sequence but poorly to G-box/ABRE sequences. Interestingly, OBF3.1 bound eightfold more efficiently to an ocs-element sequence than TGA1a, raising the possibility that OBF3.1 and TGA1a may be distinct members of an OBF3/TGA subfamily."
"8623550","articletitle","The two nonstructural proteins from wheat dwarf virus involved in viral gene expression and replication are retinoblastoma-binding proteins."
"8623550","abstracttext","Tumor-inducing viruses like simian virus 40 or the human adenovirus produce oncoproteins which interfere with the cellular retinoblastoma (Rb) tumor-suppressor protein to create an appropriate molecular environment in the nucleus for viral transcription and replication. Such a strategy has been considered to be restricted to animal viruses. Here we demonstrate that plant viruses may use similar mechanisms for recruiting host factors. Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) encodes two potential nonstructural proteins, C1 and C1:C2, both containing the consensus Rb-binding motif LeuXCysXGlu that allows the oncoproteins from animal viruses to inactivate Rb. C1:C2 is a key determinant of viral replication and V(virion)-sense expression. Using a yeast two-hybrid protein assay, we demonstrate for the first time that the C1:C2 protein from WDV interacts with a retinoblastoma protein, providing an explanation for the previously observed dependence of viral replication on an intact Rb-binding motif. We also show that C1, for which no function had been demonstrated, is required for V-sense gene expression. This suggests that V-sense expression might be dependent on the interaction of C1 with Rb. Our findings provide further evidence for the presence of transforming-like proteins in a plant virus and will help to explain the production of symptoms in a plant viral infection through a mechanism mediated by a key regulator of cell cycle and differentiation."

"8661399","abstracttext","The G1 and G2 glycoproteins of La Crosse virus, a member of the Bunyavirus genus of the Bunyaviridae, are encoded as a single open reading frame (ORF) in the viral middle-sized RNA segment. The primary product from this ORF is processed, either cotranslationally or shortly after translation, into the two glycoproteins and a nonstructural protein, NSm, of unknown function. We have expressed La Crosse glycoproteins using vaccinia vectors and studied their processing and localization. When expressed in the native G2-NSm-G1 configuration, both G1 and G2 targeted to the Golgi apparatus as shown by their colocalization with wheat germ agglutinin and acquired resistance to endoglycosidase H. When expressed independently, G2 was targeted to the Golgi apparatus but G1 was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that a G1-G2 association is required for Golgi targeting of G1. In contrast to results with other members of the Bunyaviridae, we found that expression of G1 and G2 from separate vectors did not lead to the transport of the G1-G2 complex to the Golgi. However, disruption of the NSm region with a foreign sequence did not interfere with transport of the complex. When a portion of the beta-galactosidase gene was inserted in frame into NSm, the glycoproteins derived from this construct were processed and targeted properly and were capable of mediating cell-to-cell fusion."

"8798570","abstracttext","ELK is a member of the Eph-related tyrosine kinase family that includes receptors signaling axonal guidance, neuronal bundling, and angiogenesis. We recently identified ELK expression in human renal microvascular endothelial cells and sought to identify intracellular proteins through which it signals responses. The cytoplasmic domain of ELK was used as ""bait"" in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interactive proteins expressed from a randomly primed embryonic murine library (E9.5-10.5). Among interactive products of 76 cDNAs characterized, 10 nonidentical, overlapping clones encoded the SH2 domain of the recently reported Grb10 adapter protein, and an additional 3 encoded Grb2. A self-phosphorylated recombinant, baculovirus-expressed GST-ELKcy fusion protein bound Grb10 and Grb2 from human renal microvascular endothelial cell extracts, while the unphosphorylated fusion form did not. Site-directed mutation identified Tyr-929 as a putative phosphorylation site required for Grb10, but not Grb2, interaction in yeast and recombinant protein assays. The ELK ligand, LERK-2/Fc, stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of ELK, and recruitment of Grb10 and Grb2 to endothelial ELK receptors recovered by wheat germ agglutinin lectin and immunoprecipitation. These findings define ligand-activated interaction between ELK and the SH2 domains of Grb2 and the newly identified Grb10 protein that shares homology with a Caenorhabditis elegans gene product implicated in neural cell migration."

"8799136","abstracttext","Retinoblastoma (RB-1) is a tumor suppressor gene that encodes a 105-kDa nuclear phosphoprotein. To date, RB genes have been isolated only from metazoans. We have isolated a cDNA from maize endosperm whose predicted protein product (ZmRb) shows homology to the ""pocket"" A and B domains of the Rb protein family. We found ZmRb behaves as a pocket protein based on its ability to specifically interact with oncoproteins encoded by DNA tumor viruses (E7, T-Ag, E1A). ZmRb can interact in vitro and in vivo with the replication-associated protein, RepA, encoded by the wheat dwarf virus. The maize Rb-related protein undergoes changes in level and phosphorylation state concomitant with endoreduplication, and it is phosphorylated in vitro by an S-phase kinase from endoreduplicating endosperm cells. Together, our results suggest that ZmRb is a representative of the pocket protein family and may play a role in cell cycle progression. Moreover, certain plant monopartite geminiviruses may operate similarly to mammalian DNA viruses, by targeting and inactivating the retinoblastoma protein, which otherwise induces G1 arrest."

RT-PCR was used to amplify, clone and sequence a region of about 750 nucleotides spanning the capsid protein gene and part of the readthrough protein on RNA-2 from OGSV, a French isolate of SBWMV and two stable deletion mutants (Lab1 and Okl-7) of SBWMV isolates from Nebraska and Oklahoma respectively. There was very high (96.7-99.1%) nucleotide homology between all these sequences and the wild-type SBWMV sequences from Nebraska and Oklahoma. OGSV was more similar to SBWMV from France and Nebraska than were any of the isolates to SBWMV from Oklahoma. Of the few differences in the deduced amino acid sequences of the capsid proteins from the different isolates, OGSV differed from all SBWMV isolates only in one amino acid (isoleucine for valine at position 88). The high degree of similarity suggests that OGSV may best be classified as an oat strain of SBWMV."
"8787022","articletitle","The interaction of light and abscisic acid in the regulation of plant gene expression."
"8787022","abstracttext","Extended dark treatments of light-grown plants of both Lemna gibba and Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in substantial increases in abscisic acid (ABA) concentrations. The concentration of ABA could be negatively regulated by phytochrome action in Lemna. As has been noted in other species, ABA treatment reduced Lemna rbcS and Lhcb RNA levels, which are positively regulated by phytochrome in many species. In view of these observations, the possibility that phytochrome effects on gene expression may be mediated primarily by changes in ABA was tested using a transient assay in intact plants. The phytochrome responsiveness of the Lemna Lhcb2*1 promoter was still apparent in the presence of exogenous ABA. Additionally, when 2-bp mutations were introduced into this promoter so that phytochrome responsiveness was lost, a response to exogenous ABA was still present. We conclude that phytochrome- and ABA-response elements are separable in the Lhcb2*1 promoter. We tested whether the effects of ABA on RNA abundance could be inhibited by treatment with gibberellin and found no evidence for such an inhibition. We have also found that the ABA-responsive Em promoter of wheat can be negatively regulated by phytochrome action. It is likely that this regulation is mediated at least in part by phytochrome-induced changes in ABA levels. Our results demonstrate that it is essential to take into account that dark treatments and the phytochrome system can affect ABA levels when interpreting studies of light-regulated genes."

"10198061","abstracttext","The nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin plays an important role in the Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway. This study describes an examination of the nuclear import of beta-catenin in living mammalian cells and in vitro semi-intact cells. When injected into the cell cytoplasm, beta-catenin rapidly migrated into the nucleus in a temperature-dependent and wheat germ agglutinin-sensitive manner. In the cell-free import assay, beta-catenin rapidly migrates into the nucleus without the exogenous addition of cytosol, Ran, or ATP/GTP. Cytoplasmic injection of mutant Ran defective in its GTP hydrolysis did not prevent beta-catenin import. Studies using tsBN2, a temperature-sensitive mutant cell line that possesses a point mutation in the RCC1 gene, showed that the import of beta-catenin is insensitive to nuclear Ran-GTP depletion. These results show that beta-catenin possesses the ability to constitutively translocate through the nuclear pores in a manner similar to importin beta in a Ran-unassisted manner. We further showed that beta-catenin also rapidly exits the nucleus in homokaryons, suggesting that the regulation of nuclear levels of beta-catenin involves both nuclear import and export of this molecule."

"10198125","abstracttext","We obtained 16 nucleotide sequences ( approximately 1400 bp each) of the first intron of the mitochondrial (mt) gene for NADH subunit 4 (nad4) from 10 species of Brassicaceae. Using these new sequences and five published sequences from GenBank, we constructed a phylogenetic tree of the Brassicaceae species under study and showed that the rate of nucleotide substitution in the first intron of nad4 is very low, about 0.16-0.23 x 10(-9) substitution per site per year, which is about half of the silent rate in exons of nad4. The ratios of substitution rates in this intron, ITS, and IGS are approximately 1:23:73, where ITS is the nuclear intergenic spacer between 18S and 25S rRNA genes and IGS is the intergenic spacer of 5S rRNA genes. A segment (335 bp) in the first intron of nad4 in Brassicaceae species that is absent in wheat was considered as a nonfunctional sequence and used to estimate the neutral rate (the rate of mutation) in mtDNA to be 0.5-0.7 x 10(-9) substitution per site per year, which is about three times higher than the substitution rate in the rest of the first intron of nad4. We estimated that the dates of divergence are 170-235 million years (Myr) for the monocot-dicot split, 112-156 Myr for the Brassicaceae-Lettuce split, 14.5-20.4 Myr for the Brassica-Arabidopsis split, and 14.5-20.4 Myr for the Arabidopsis-Arabideae split."

In liquid culture, most of the reDer fI E(-1)K produced by the transformants was degraded when culture was shaken vigorously. However, the degradation of reDer fI E(-1)K was suppressed when it was shaken gently. The processed reDer fI E(-1)K could be obtained after lysylendopeptidase and endoglycosidase Hf (Endo Hf) treatment. The yield of processed reDer fI E(-1)K was 8 mg/l. When the transformant was grown on a wheat bran culture, the yield of processed reDer fI E(-1)K reached 48 mg/kg. Because processed reDer fI E(-1)Ks obtained from both cultures had almost the same IgE-binding activity and elicited the same skin reaction as native Der fI, they could be very useful for diagnostic purposes or immunotherapy."
