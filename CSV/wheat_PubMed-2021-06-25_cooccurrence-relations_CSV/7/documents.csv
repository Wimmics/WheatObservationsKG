"10344200","articletitle","Involvement of a maize proline-rich protein in secondary cell wall formation as deduced from its specific mRNA localization."
"10344200","abstracttext","A clone encoding a proline-rich protein (ZmPRP) has been obtained from maize root by differential screening of a maturing elongation root cDNA library. The amino acid sequence deduced from the full-length cDNA contains a putative signal peptide and a highly repetitive sequence containing the PEPK motif, indicating that the ZmPRP mRNA may code for a cell wall protein. The PEPK repeat is also found in a previously reported wheat sequence but differs from the repeated sequences found in hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP) and in dicot proline-rich proteins (PRP). In the maize genome, the ZmPRP protein is encoded by a single gene that is expressed in maturing regions of the root, in the hypocotyl and in the pericarp. In these organs, the ZmPRP mRNA accumulates in the xylem and surrounding cells, and in the epidermis. No ZmPRP mRNA was found in the phloem. The pattern of mRNA accumulation is very similar to the one observed for genes coding for proteins involved in lignin biosynthesis and, like most cell wall proteins, ZmPRP synthesis is also induced by wounding. These data support the hypothesis that ZmPRP is a member of a new class of fibrous proteins involved in the secondary cell wall formation in monocot species."
"10358091","articletitle","A new nucleoporin-like protein interacts with both HIV-1 Rev nuclear export signal and CRM-1."
"10358091","abstracttext","The HIV-1 Rev is a shuttling protein required for the nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced viral mRNA. In this study, we have identified a new Rev-interacting protein, that specifically interacts with the Rev nuclear export signal both in yeast and mammalian cells. This protein has features found in nucleoporins including many phenylalanine-glycine repeats, a very high serine content, a putative zinc finger, and a coiled-coil domain; we thus called it NLP-1 (nucleoporin-like protein 1). In addition, gene expression analysis and wheat germ agglutinin chromatography experiments suggested that NLP-1 is an ubiquitous O-glycosylated nuclear protein. Recently, a cellular factor called CRM-1 has been shown to be an essential nuclear export factor interacting directly with nuclear export signals including the Rev nuclear export signal in a RanGTP-dependent manner. We show here that NLP-1, like the previously described Rev-interacting protein hRIP/Rab and several nucleoporins, also interacts with CRM-1 both in yeast and mammalian cells."
"9106503","articletitle","Structural characteristics of two wheat histone H2A genes encoding distinct types of variants and functional differences in their promoter activity."
"9106503","abstracttext","To investigate the regulation of plant histone H2A gene expression, we isolated two H2A genes (TH254 and TH274) from wheat, which encode two variants of H2A. Both genes had an intron in the coding region. In the promoters, some characteristic sequences, such as Oct and Nona motifs, which are conserved among plant histone genes, were located in a short region (about 120 bp) upstream from the putative TATA box. Transient expression analyses of promoter activity with H2A-GUS fusion genes using tobacco protoplasts revealed novel types of positive cis-acting sequences in the TH254 promoter: a direct repeat of a 13 bp sequence (AGTTACATTATTG) and a stretch composed of an AT-rich sequence (ATATAGAAAATTAAAA) and a G-box (CACGTG). Quantitative S1 assay of the mRNA amounts from the TH254/GUS and TH274/GUS chimeric genes in stably transformed and cell cycle-synchronized tobacco cell lines showed that the promoters of both genes contained at least one cis-acting element responsible for S phase-specific expression. Histochemical analysis of transgenic tobacco plants carrying the chimeric genes showed that the promoters of the two H2A genes were active in developing seedlings and flower organs but were regulated in a different manner."
"10419528","articletitle","Nuclear import of plasmid DNA in digitonin-permeabilized cells requires both cytoplasmic factors and specific DNA sequences."
"10419528","abstracttext","Although much is known about the mechanisms of signal-mediated protein and RNA nuclear import and export, little is understood concerning the nuclear import of plasmid DNA. Plasmids between 4.2 and 14.4 kilobases were specifically labeled using a fluorescein-conjugated peptide nucleic acid clamp. The resulting substrates were capable of gene expression and nuclear localization in microinjected cells in the absence of cell division. To elucidate the requirements for plasmid nuclear import, a digitonin-permeabilized cell system was adapted to follow the nuclear localization of plasmids. Nuclear import of labeled plasmid was time- and energy-dependent, was inhibited by the lectin wheat germ agglutinin, and showed an absolute requirement for cytoplasmic extract. Addition of nuclear extract alone did not support plasmid nuclear import but in combination with cytoplasm stimulated plasmid nuclear localization. Whereas addition of purified importin alpha, importin beta, and RAN was sufficient to support protein nuclear import, plasmid nuclear import also required the addition of nuclear extract. Finally, nuclear import of plasmid DNA was sequence-specific, requiring a region of the SV40 early promoter and enhancer. Taken together, these results confirm and extend our findings in microinjected cells and support a protein-mediated mechanism for plasmid nuclear import."
"10421366","articletitle","'Green revolution' genes encode mutant gibberellin response modulators."
"10421366","abstracttext","World wheat grain yields increased substantially in the 1960s and 1970s because farmers rapidly adopted the new varieties and cultivation methods of the so-called 'green revolution'. The new varieties are shorter, increase grain yield at the expense of straw biomass, and are more resistant to damage by wind and rain. These wheats are short because they respond abnormally to the plant growth hormone gibberellin. This reduced response to gibberellin is conferred by mutant dwarfing alleles at one of two Reduced height-1 (Rht-B1 and Rht-D1) loci. Here we show that Rht-B1/Rht-D1 and maize dwarf-8 (d8) are orthologues of the Arabidopsis Gibberellin Insensitive (GAI) gene. These genes encode proteins that resemble nuclear transcription factors and contain an SH2-like domain, indicating that phosphotyrosine may participate in gibberellin signalling. Six different orthologous dwarfing mutant alleles encode proteins that are altered in a conserved amino-terminal gibberellin signalling domain. Transgenic rice plants containing a mutant GAI allele give reduced responses to gibberellin and are dwarfed, indicating that mutant GAI orthologues could be used to increase yield in a wide range of crop species."
"9414388","articletitle","Ultrastructural changes related to multidrug resistance in CEM cells: role of cytoplasmic vesicles in drug exclusion."
"9414388","abstracttext","The multidrug resistance phenotype is found to be frequently associated with the overexpression of proteins which lead to a decrease of drug accumulation within human tumor cells. A 170 kDa membrane glycoprotein which is related to the overexpression of the mdr1 gene is inserted in the plasma membrane and pumps the cytotoxic drugs out of the cells. The aim of this work was to study the morphological modifications of resistant CEM/VLB 100 cells relative to their parental drug-sensitive ones and the detection of the ultrastructural localization of P-glycoprotein at the cytoplasmic level. Using a scanning electron microscope, CEM resistant cells showed wide smooth protrusions while CEM sensitive cells showed microvilli and fine folds. With transmission electron microscopy, an enhanced secretory system was observed in CEM resistant cells: both electron transparent and electron opaque vesicles were associated with the Golgi system, revealed by wheat germ agglutinin-colloidal gold labelling. These vesicles were the binding site of C 219 and MRK 16 antimembrane glycoprotein antibodies, and some of them were determined to belong to the lysosomal system after PTA staining. These vesicles may be an additional way to decrease the cellular uptake of drugs in multidrug resistant cells. Moreover, some nuclear and nucleolar modifications were also observed. These observations show that MDR has wide morphological features which concern several organelles."
"9346940","articletitle","Interaction between the adhesion receptor, CD44, and the oncogene product, p185HER2, promotes human ovarian tumor cell activation."
"9346940","abstracttext","In this study we have examined the interaction between CD44s (the standard form) and the p185(HER2) proto-oncogene in the ovarian carcinoma cell line. Surface biotinylation followed by wheat germ agglutinin column chromatography and anti-CD44-mediated immunoprecipitation indicate that both CD44s and p185(HER2) are expressed on the cell surface and most importantly, that these two molecules are physically linked to each other via interchain disulfide bonds. We have also determined that hyaluronic acid stimulates CD44s-associated p185(HER2) tyrosine kinase activity, leading to an increase in the ovarian carcinoma cell growth. After transfection of the ovarian carcinoma cell line with the adenovirus 5 E1A gene, which is known to repress p185(HER2) expression, we observed that both surface CD44s expression and CD44s-mediated cell adhesion to hyaluronic acid are significantly reduced in the transfectant cells compared with the control cells. These data suggest that down-regulation of p185(HER2) blocks CD44s expression and subsequent adhesion function. Our findings also indicate that the CD44s-p185(HER2) interaction is both functionally coupled and biosynthetically regulated. We believe that direct ""cross-talk"" between these two surface molecules (i.e. CD44s and the p185(HER2)) may be one of the most important signaling events in human ovarian carcinoma development."
"9440223","articletitle","The 5'-untranslated region of GLUT1 glucose transporter mRNA causes differential regulation of the translational rate in plant and animal systems."
"9440223","abstracttext","The blood-brain barrier GLUT1 glucose transporter is under post-transcriptional regulation, and the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the GLUT1 mRNA increases its translational rate in mammalian cells. To obtain more insight into the mechanism of translational control of GLUT1, the present investigation studied the translational efficiency of capped full-length synthetic human (h) and rabbit (rab) GLUT1 mRNA and both 5'- and 3'-UTR deleted hGLUT1 mRNAs in both mammalian and plant cell free translation systems. Translation efficiency of both h- and rabGLUT1 mRNA was increased 3- to 6-fold in rabbit retyculocyte lysate (RRL) compared with wheat germ extract (WGE). Confirming previous observations, deletion of 5'- and 5'/-3'-UTR markedly reduced the translation efficiency of the h-GLUT1 transcript in RRL. On the contrary, these deletions markedly increased the translation of GLUT1 in WGE. The present data provide additional evidence suggesting that the 5'-UTR of the GLUT1 mRNA contains cis-acting elements involved in the translational activation of the GLUT1 gene in mammalian cells and that factors involved in this cis/trans-acting interaction are either absent or down-regulated in plant systems."
"9580674","articletitle","Selective inhibition of cell-free translation by oligonucleotides targeted to a mRNA hairpin structure."
"9580674","abstracttext","Using an in vitro selection approach we have previously isolated oligodeoxy aptamers that can bind to a DNA hairpin structure without disrupting the double-stranded stem. We report here that these oligomers can bind to the RNA version of this hairpin, mostly through pairing with a designed 6 nt anchor. The part of the aptamer selected against the DNA hairpin did not increase stability of the RNA-aptamer complex. However, it contributed to the binding site for Escherichia coli RNase H, leading to very efficient cleavage of the target RNA. In addition, a 2'- O -methyloligoribonucleotide analogue of one selected sequence selectively blocked in vitro translation of luciferase in wheat germ extract by binding to the hairpin region inserted upstream of the initiation codon of the reporter gene. Therefore, non-complementary oligomers can exhibit antisense properties following hybridization with the target RNA. Our study also suggests that in vitro selection might provide a means to extend the repertoire of sequences that can be targetted by antisense oligonucleotides to structured RNA motifs of biological importance."
"9768514","articletitle","The isolation and mapping of disease resistance gene analogs in maize."
"9768514","abstracttext","Many of the plant disease resistance genes that have been isolated encode proteins with a putative nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeats (NBS-LRR resistance genes). Oligonucleotide primers based on conserved motifs in and around the NBS of known NBS-LRR resistance proteins were used to amplify sequences from maize genomic DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Eleven classes of non-cross-hybridizing sequences were obtained that had predicted products with high levels of amino acid identity to NBS-LRR resistance proteins. These maize resistance gene analogs (RGAs) and one RGA clone obtained previously from wheat were used as probes to map 20 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) loci in maize. Some RFLPs were shown to map to genomic regions containing virus and fungus resistance genes. Perfect cosegregation was observed between RGA loci and the rust resistance loci rp1 and rp3. The RGA probe associated with rp1 also detected deletion events in several rp1 mutants. These data strongly suggest that some of the RGA clones may hybridize to resistance genes."
"11292079","articletitle","The low-temperature- and salt-induced RCI2A gene of Arabidopsis complements the sodium sensitivity caused by a deletion of the homologous yeast gene SNA1."
"11292079","abstracttext","Two closely related, tandemly arranged, low-temperature- and salt-induced Arabidopsis genes, corresponding to the previously isolated cDNAs RCI2A and RCI2B, were isolated and characterized. The RCI2A transcript accumulated primarily in response to low temperature or high salinity, and to a lesser extent in response to ABA treatment or water deficit stress. The RCI2B transcript was present at much lower levels than RCI2A, and could only be detected by reverse transcription-PCR amplification. The predicted 6 kDa RCI2 proteins are highly hydrophobic and contain two putative membrane-spanning regions. The polypeptides exhibit extensive similarity to deduced low-temperature- and/or salt-induced proteins from barley, wheat grass and strawberry, and to predicted proteins from bacteria, fungi, nematodes and yeast. Interestingly, we found that a deletion of the RCI2 homologous gene, SNA1 (YRD276c), in yeast causes a salt-sensitive phenotype. This effect is specific for sodium, since no growth defect was observed for the sna1 mutant on 1.7 M sorbitol, 1 M KCl or 0.6 M LiCl. Finally, we found that the Arabidopsis RCI2A cDNA can complement the sna1 mutant when expressed in yeast, indicating that the plant and yeast proteins have similar functions during high salt stress."
"11386373","articletitle","Root mucilage from pea and its utilization by rhizosphere bacteria as a sole carbon source."
"11386373","abstracttext","Plant roots secrete a complex polysaccharide mucilage that may provide a significant source of carbon for microbes that colonize the rhizosphere. High molecular weight mucilage was separated by high-pressure liquid chromatography gel filtration from low molecular weight components of pea root exudate. Purified pea root mucilage generally was similar in sugar and glycosidic linkage composition to mucilage from cowpea, wheat, rice, and maize, but appeared to contain an unusually high amount of material that was similar to arabinogalactan protein. Purified pea mucilage was used as the sole carbon source for growth of several pea rhizosphere bacteria, including Rhizobium leguminosarum 8401 and 4292, Burkholderia cepacia AMMD, and Pseudomonas fluorescens PRA25. These species grew on mucilage to cell densities of three- to 25-fold higher than controls with no added carbon source, with cell densities of 1 to 15% of those obtained on an equal weight of glucose. Micromolar concentrations of nod gene-inducing flavonoids specifically stimulated mucilage-dependent growth of R. leguminosarum 8401 to levels almost equaling the glucose controls. R. leguminosarum 8401 was able to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl glycosides of various sugars and partially utilize a number of purified plant polysaccharides as sole carbon sources, indicating that R. leguminosarum 8401 can make an unexpected variety of carbohydrases, in accordance with its ability to extensively utilize pea root mucilage."
"11159052","articletitle","Airway epithelial cell wound repair mediated by alpha-dystroglycan."
"11159052","abstracttext","Dystroglycans (DGs) bind laminin matrix proteins in skeletal and cardiac muscle and are expressed in other nonmuscle tissues. However, their expression in airway epithelial cells has not been demonstrated. We examined expression of DGs in the human airway epithelial cell line 1HAEo(-), and in human primary airway epithelial cells. Expression of the common gene for alpha- and beta-DG was demonstrated by reverse transcriptase/ polymerase chain reaction in 1HAEo(-) cells. Protein expression of beta-DG was demonstrated by both Western blot and flow cytometry in cultured cells. Localization of alpha-DG, using both a monoclonal antibody and the alpha-DG binding lectin wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA), was to the cell membrane and nucleus. We then examined the function of DGs in modulating wound repair over laminin matrix. Blocking alpha-DG binding to laminin in 1HAEo(-) monolayers using either glycosyaminoglycans or WGA attenuated cell migration and spreading after mechanical injury. alpha-DG was not expressed in epithelial cells at the wound edge immediately after wound creation, but localized to the cell membrane in these cells within 12 h of injury. These data demonstrate the presence of DGs in airway epithelium. alpha-DG is dynamically expressed and serves as a lectin to bind laminin during airway epithelial cell repair."
"10869425","articletitle","Gene genealogies reveal global phylogeographic structure and reproductive isolation among lineages of Fusarium graminearum, the fungus causing wheat scab."
"10869425","abstracttext","During the past decade, the plant disease called scab or Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley has reached epidemic proportions in North America and elsewhere in the world. Scab is an economically devastating plant disease, not only because it causes significant reduction in seed yields and quality, but also because infested seeds are often contaminated with trichothecene and estrogenic mycotoxins that pose a serious threat to animal health and food safety. To test whether the primary etiological agent of scab, the fungus Fusarium graminearum, is panmictic throughout its range, allelic genealogies were constructed from six single-copy nuclear genes from strains selected to represent the global genetic diversity of this pathogen. Excluding one hybrid strain, all six genealogies recovered the same seven biogeographically structured lineages, suggesting that they represent phylogenetically distinct species among which gene flow has been very limited during their evolutionary history. Parsimony analysis of the combined data set comprising 7,120 aligned nucleotide characters resolved most relationships among the seven lineages of the F. graminearum clade and related fusaria included in the study. Phylogenetic evidence is also presented for introgressive hybridization and intragenic recombination among lineages of the F. graminearum clade in nature."
"11161711","articletitle","Membrane depolarization mediates phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of CREB in vascular smooth muscle cells."
"11161711","abstracttext","Diverse signals have the potential to modulate gene transcription through the Ca2+ and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). A key step in the transmission of these signals is import into the nucleus. Here, we provide evidence that the Ran GTPase, which regulates nuclear import, exerts different regulation over PDGF-BB, Ca2+, and cAMP signaling to CREB in VSMCs. PDGF-BB, membrane depolarization, and forskolin increased levels of activated CREB (P-CREB) and c-fos in VSMCs and intact aorta. The calcium channel antagonist nimodipine reduced the level of P-CREB stimulated by membrane depolarization, but not by PDGF-BB or forskolin. Block of Ran-mediated nuclear import, by wheat germ agglutinin or an inactivating Ran mutant (T24N Ran), significantly reduced nuclear P-CREB in response to PDGF-BB or membrane depolarization, but enhanced levels of P-CREB in response to forskolin. Contrary to expectation, block of nuclear import led to the appearance of P-CREB in the cytoplasm after depolarization. Furthermore, blocking nuclear export with leptomycin B reduced P-CREB stimulation by both depolarization and PDGF-BB. These results suggest that translocation of CREB between the nucleus and the cytoplasm provides an important role in CREB activating pathways in VSMCs."
"11017767","articletitle","Characterization of the ABC transporter genes MgAtr1 and MgAtr2 from the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola."
"11017767","abstracttext","ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are membrane-bound transporters involved in various physiological processes. In this paper we describe the cloning of the ABC transporter encoding genes MgAtr1 and MgAtr2 from the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici). Both deduced proteins MgAtr1 and MgAtr2 are highly homologous to other fungal ABC transporters. RT-PCR revealed that the MgAtr2 mRNA population consists of partially and fully spliced transcripts. Putative substrates of ABC transporters, modulators of ABC transporter activity, and inducers of ABC transporter gene transcription were analyzed for their potential to induce expression of MgAtr1 and MgAtr2 in m. graminicola. The genes are differently upregulated by compounds such as the plant secondary metabolites eugenol and reserpine. Similar results are obtained for several antibiotics and the azole fungicides cyproconazole and imazalil. Moreover, a different expression pattern between yeast-like cells and mycelium of this dimorphic fungus was observed. These results indicate that MgAtr1 and MgAtr2 play a role in protection of m. graminicola against natural toxic compounds and xenobiotics. A putative role in protection against plant defense compounds during pathogenesis is suggested."
"10413091","articletitle","The nuclear origin of the non-phosphorylating NADH dehydrogenases of plant mitochondria."
"10413091","abstracttext","The oxidation of matrix and cytosolic NADH by isolated beetroot and wheat leaf mitochondria was investigated to determine whether the rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenases of plant mitochondria were the products of nuclear or mitochondrial genes. After aging beetroot tissue (slicing and incubating in a CaSO4 solution), the induction of the level of matrix NADH oxidation in the presence of rotenone was greatly reduced in mitochondria isolated from tissue treated with cycloheximide, a nuclear protein synthesis inhibitor. This was also true for the oxidation of cytosolic NADH. Mitochondria isolated from chloramphenicol-treated tissue exhibited greatly increased levels of both matrix and external rotenone-insensitive NADH oxidation when compared to the increase due to the aging process alone. This increase was not accompanied by an increase in matrix NAD-linked substrate dehydrogenases such as malic enzyme nor intra-mitochondrial NAD levels. Possible explanations for this increase in rotenone-insensitive NADH oxidation are discussed. Based on these results we have concluded that the matrix facing rotenone-insensitive NADH dehydrogenase of plant mitochondria is encoded by a nuclear gene and synthesis of the protein occurs in the cytosol."
"10446243","articletitle","The cloning of plant E2F, a retinoblastoma-binding protein, reveals unique and conserved features with animal G(1)/S regulators."
"10446243","abstracttext","Association of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein with E2F transcription factors is central to cell cycle-specific gene expression and growth in animal cells. Whether Rb-E2F complexes are also involved in plant cell growth and differentiation is still unknown since E2F proteins have not yet been identified in plants. Here we report the isolation and characterisation of a wheat E2F (TmE2F) cDNA clone. Interestingly, the overall domain organisation of plant E2F is related to the human E2F-1/2/3 subset but its primary sequence is slightly more related to the E2F-4/5 subset. TmE2F-Rb binding depends on residues, located at the C-terminus, which are different from those of animal E2Fs. However, the acidic or hydrophobic nature of certain residues is maintained, strongly suggesting that they may have a crucial role in E2F activities. Plant E2F is expressed in proliferating cultured cells and in differentiated tissues and is up-regulated early in S phase. Our studies reinforce the idea that G(1)/S regulators in plants are unrelated to those of yeast cells but similar to those of animal cells and provide new tools to analyse the links between cell cycle regulators, plant growth and developmental signals."
"10534416","articletitle","Genetic transformation and mutagenesis of the entomopathogenic fungus paecilomyces fumosoroseus"
"10534416","abstracttext","We have developed a DNA-mediated transformation system for the entomopathogenic fungus Paecilomyces fumosoroseus based on resistance to the herbicide glufosinate ammonium. The resistance is provided by the bar gene from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and is under the control of the Aspergillus nidulans trpC promoter and terminator sequences. Frequencies of up to 110 transformants/&mgr;g of linearized plasmid DNA were obtained aided by the addition of the nuclease inhibitor, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA). The transformants were stable for drug resistance for five consecutive vegetative transfers under selective and nonselective conditions. Southern analyses revealed that the transforming DNA integrated into the P. fumosoroseus genome in single and multiple copies. Single-copy integration events were generated with higher efficiency by restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI), although rates of transformation were generally not as high as those treatments containing ATA. Two mutant strains altered in sporulation capacity and virulence toward the Russian wheat aphid were recovered using this approach. This transformation-based manipulation of P. fumosoroseus will facilitate insertional mutagenesis and the functional analysis of various genes."
"10584305","articletitle","Molecular genetic mapping of three X-linked avirulence genes, vH6, vH9 and vH13, in the Hessian fly."
"10584305","abstracttext","Three X-linked avirulence genes, vH6, vH9, and vH13 in the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor, confer avirulence to Hessian fly resistance genes H6, H9, and H13 in wheat. We used a combination of two- and three-point crosses to determine the order of these genes with respect to each other, the white eye mutation and three X-linked molecular markers, G15-1, 020, and 021, developed from genomic lambda clones, lambda G15-1, lambda 020, and lambda 021. The gene order was determined to be vH9-vH6-G15-1-w-vH13-020-021. In situ hybridization of lambda G15-1, lambda 020, and lambda 021, on the polytene chromosomes of the Hessian fly salivary gland established their orientation on Hessian fly chromosome X1. Based on the size of the Hessian fly genome, and the genetic distances between markers, the relationship of physical to genetic distance was estimated at no more than 300 kb/cM along Hessian fly chromosome X1, suggesting that map-based cloning of these avirulence genes will be feasible."
"10701112","articletitle","Properties of sequence-tagged-site primer sets influencing repeatability."
"10701112","abstracttext","The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has become a standard procedure in plant genetics, and is the basis for many emerging genomics approaches to mapping and gene identification. One advantage of PCR is that sequence information for primer sets can be exchanged between laboratories, obviating the need for exchange and maintenance of biological materials. Repeatability of primer sets, whereby the same products are amplified in different laboratories using the same primer set, is important to successful exchange and utilization. We have developed several hundred sequence-tagged site (STS) primer sets for wheat and barley. The ability of the primer sets to generate reproducible amplifications in other laboratories has been variable. We wished to empirically determine the properties of the primer sets that most influenced repeatability. A total of 96 primer sets were tested with four genomic DNA samples on each of four thermocyclers. All major bands were repeatable across all four thermocylers for approximately 50% of the primer sets. Characteristics most often associated with differences in repeatability included primer GC content and 3'-end stability of the primers. The propensity for primer-dimer formation was not a factor in repeatability. Our results provide empirical direction for the development of repeatable primer sets."
"10750706","articletitle","Accumulation of plastocyanin mRNA lacking 5' region in the green alga Pediastrum boryanum grown under copper-deficient conditions."
"10750706","abstracttext","In the green alga Pediastrum boryanum NIES-301, plastocyanin accumulates under copper-sufficient conditions and cytochrome c6 accumulates under copper-deficient conditions. We cloned the cDNA which encodes pre-apoplastocyanin from P. boryanum cultured under the copper-sufficient condition. The deduced amino acid sequence of the pre-apoplastocyanin protein consists of 151 amino acid residues including a putative bipartite presequence of 53 amino acid residues. Southern blot analysis of P. boryanum genomic DNA indicated that pre-apoplastocyanin is encoded by a single nuclear gene. Northern blot analysis showed that copper-deficient cells accumulated a shorter form of the mRNA of pre-apoplastocyanin, which did not generate pre-apoplastocyanin in the wheat-germ translation system. The difference in size was ascribed to the absence of the 5' region in the mRNA of pre-apoplastocyanin obtained from the copper-deficient cells, which accounts for the absence of plastocyanin under these conditions. This phenomenon represents a novel regulatory mechanism, although details of the mechanism are not yet known."
"10762425","articletitle","Mitochondrial DNA sequence divergence among greenbug (Homoptera: aphididae) biotypes: evidence for host-adapted races."
"10762425","abstracttext","The full complement of known greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), biotypes found in the USA were subjected to a molecular phylogenetic analysis based on a 1.2-kb portion of the cytochrome oxidase I mitochondrial gene. In addition to these nine biotypes (B, C, E, F, G, H, I, J and K), a probable isolate of the enigmatic biotype A (NY), a 'new biotype' collected from Elymus canadensis (L.) (CWR), and an isolate from Germany (EUR) were included. Schizaphis rotundiventris (Signoret) was included as an outgroup. Genetic distances among S. graminum biotypes ranged from 0.08% to 6.17% difference in nucleotide substitutions. Neighbour-joining, maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood analyses all produced dendrograms revealing three clades within S. graminum. Clade 1 contained the 'agricultural' biotypes commonly found on sorghum and wheat (C, E, K, I, plus J) and there were few substitutions among these biotypes. Clade 2 contained F, G and NY, and Clade 3 contained B, CWR and EUR, all of which are rarely found on crops. The rarest biotype, H, fell outside the above clades and may represent another Schizaphis species. S. graminum biotypes are a mixture of genotypes belonging to three clades and may have diverged as host-adapted races on wild grasses."
"10634180","articletitle","Murine yolk sac and bone marrow hematopoietic cells with high proliferative potential display different capacities for producing colony-forming cells ex vivo."
"10634180","abstracttext","Increasing evidence suggests that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from embryonic and fetal tissues demonstrate proliferative capacities greater than cells isolated from adult hematopoietic tissues. Few studies have explored the organization of the high proliferative potential hematopoietic progenitor hierarchy in the murine yolk sac. We have demonstrated the appearance of high proliferative potential colony-forming cells (HPP-CFC) in the yolk sac as early as embryonic day 8 (E8). Yolk sac HPP-CFC colony size and differentiated cellular composition were similar to adult marrow HPP-CFC. The frequency of yolk sac HPP-CFC at E11 was greater than HPP-CFC frequency in the adult marrow. Replating of primary yolk sac HPP-CFC resulted in significantly greater HPP-CFC and multipotent progenitors than replated adult marrow primary HPP-CFC. Similar results were obtained when AA4.1-expressing yolk sac and adult marrow cells that bind wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) were isolated via flow cytometry. These results support growing evidence that fetal, and perhaps embryonic, hematopoietic tissues may be excellent alternative sources of highly proliferative hematopoietic cells as targets for somatic gene therapy."
"12970342","articletitle","Detoxification of the Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol by a UDP-glucosyltransferase from Arabidopsis thaliana."
"12970342","abstracttext","Plant pathogenic fungi of the genus Fusarium cause agriculturally important diseases of small grain cereals and maize. Trichothecenes are a class of mycotoxins produced by different Fusarium species that inhibit eukaryotic protein biosynthesis and presumably interfere with the expression of genes induced during the defense response of the plants. One of its members, deoxynivalenol, most likely acts as a virulence factor during fungal pathogenesis and frequently accumulates in grain to levels posing a threat to human and animal health. We report the isolation and characterization of a gene from Arabidopsis thaliana encoding a UDP-glycosyltransferase that is able to detoxify deoxynivalenol. The enzyme, previously assigned the identifier UGT73C5, catalyzes the transfer of glucose from UDP-glucose to the hydroxyl group at carbon 3 of deoxynivalenol. Using a wheat germ extract-coupled transcription/translation system we have shown that this enzymatic reaction inactivates the mycotoxin. This deoxynivalenol-glucosyltransferase (DOGT1) was also found to detoxify the acetylated derivative 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol, whereas no protective activity was observed against the structurally similar nivalenol. Expression of the glucosyltransferase is developmentally regulated and induced by deoxynivalenol as well as salicylic acid, ethylene, and jasmonic acid. Constitutive overexpression in Arabidopsis leads to enhanced tolerance against deoxynivalenol."

"11827965","abstracttext","Recently, lyso-sphingolipids have been identified as ligands for several orphan G protein-coupled receptors, although the molecular mechanism for their generation has yet to be clarified. Here, we report the molecular cloning of the enzyme, which catalyzes the generation of lyso-sphingolipids from various sphingolipids (sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase). The 75-kDa enzyme was purified from the marine bacterium, Shewanella alga G8, and its gene was cloned from a G8 genomic library using sequences of the purified enzyme. The cloned enzyme was composed of 992 amino acids, including a signal sequence of 35 residues, and its molecular weight was estimated to be 109,843. Significant sequence similarities were found with an unknown protein of Streptomyces fradiae Y59 and a Lumbricus terrestris lectin but not other known functional proteins. The 106-kDa recombinant enzyme expressed in Escherichia coli hydrolyzed various glycosphingolipids and sphingomyelin, although it seems to be much less active than the native 75-kDa enzyme. In vitro translation using wheat germ extract revealed the activity of a 75-kDa deletion mutant lacking a C terminus to be much stronger than that of the full-length enzyme, suggesting that C-terminal processing is necessary for full activity."

"11842184","abstracttext","ENOD40 is expressed at an early stage in root nodule organogenesis in legumes. Identification of ENOD40 homologs in nonleguminous plants suggests that this gene may have a more general biological function. In vitro translation of soybean ENOD40 mRNA in wheat germ extracts revealed that the conserved nucleotide sequence at the 5' end (region I) encodes two peptides of 12 and 24 aa residues (peptides A and B). These peptides are synthesized de novo from very short, overlapping ORFs. Appropriate ORFs are present in all legume ENOD40s studied thus far. In this case small peptides are directly translated from polycistronic eukaryotic mRNA. The 24-aa peptide B was detected in nodules by Western blotting. Both peptides specifically bind to the same 93-kDa protein, which was affinity purified from soybean nodules. Using peptide mass fingerprinting, we identified this binding protein as nodulin 100, which is a subunit of sucrose synthase. Based on our data we suggest that ENOD40 peptides are involved in the control of sucrose use in nitrogen-fixing nodules."
"11890698","articletitle","Temporal generation of multiple antifungal proteins in primed seeds."
"11890698","abstracttext","A drastic increase of antifungal activity was demonstrated during plant seed germination and in seed protein extract in vitro. Multiple antifungal proteins with a wide spectrum of activity were generated and identified. Chromatographic and electrophoretic analysis demonstrated that during seed germination, more fractions with potent antifungal activity were generated, and the antifungal activity shifted from small molecules to high molecular proteins. This germination-related increase of antifungal activity were observed in all three plants tested, i.e., cheeseweed, cigar tree and wheat. This rapid increase of antifungal activity was also observed with incubation of seed proteins in vitro, suggesting that at least part of the antifungal protein generation is independent of gene expression. Seven antifungal proteins with activities against five different plant pathogens were isolated from the active fractions. However, random digestion of purified seed protein with multiple proteinases failed to generate any antifungal proteins. It is suggested that during plant seed germination, a regulated biochemical process takes place that results in the generation of multiple peptides or proteins with antifungal activities. This onset of antifungal proteins is transitional in nature, but could play an important role in the protection of plants in early stage of development when the more sophisticated defense system has yet to develop."

"11927376","abstracttext","The present study was undertaken to further characterize and subdivide the rhinal cortex (insular and perirhinal areas) in the hedgehog tenrec (Echinops telfairi), a placental mammal with a rather low encephalisation index. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase into the dorsolateral pontine tegmentum revealed a prominent layer 1 projection to several rhinal target areas, while the rhinal cortex only stained weakly for the calcitonin gene-related peptide. Among the regions retrogradely labeled following tracer injections into the rhinal cortex, the parabrachial nucleus was considered the main origin of the tegmento-cortical projection. This conclusion was based on the circumscribed pattern of termination, as well as the differences noted between the pattern of anterograde labeling and the pattern obtained by thyrosine hydroxylase immunohistochemistry. The tracer injections into the dorsolateral tegmentum also revealed numerous retrogradely labeled cells in the layer 5 of the dorsomedial frontal cortex. In contrast, the rhinal cortex only showed few labeled cells and most of these cells were located in the layer 6/7. A comparison with other species indicates that the tenrec's parabrachial nucleus gives rise to the most extensive cortical projections but receives the least prominent input from the lateral cerebral hemisphere. The layer 6/7 projection may be a common mammalian feature but it is overshadowed by the layer 5 projection in higher mammals."
"11880579","articletitle","Progress in breeding for trace minerals in staple crops."
"11880579","abstracttext","Staples are not considered an important source of minerals in the diet. However, because of high staple consumption, any increase in mineral concentration might well have a significant effect on human nutrition and health. The nutritional quality of staple crops (rice, cassava, wheat, maize and beans) can be improved by breeding. Studies have shown the potential to exploit the genetic variation in seed concentration of iron and other minerals without the general negative effect on yield of adding new traits. The relationship between yield and mineral concentration may be positive, particularly in mineral-deficient soil. Initial evaluations have shown that some crop varieties have high Fe, Zn and carotene in their edible portions. The next step for conventional breeding will be to study the genetics of trace mineral inheritance to determine the best selection technique. Initial investigations of the genetics for high iron in rice have indicated a complex mode of inheritance, demonstrating additive and dominant gene and environmental effects. Breeding strategies have been developed based on these genetic findings. The use of biotechnological tools, such as molecular marker-assisted selection, will significantly increase the pace and prospects of success for breeding to improve the nutritional value of staple food crops."

"10209765","abstracttext","Linkages of Ywp1 to other components of the Yarrowia lipolytica mycelial cell wall were studied by extraction with beta-mercaptoethanol and zymolyase (a beta-glucanase complex) and by the use of rabbit polyclonal antibody preparation raised against Ywp1. Ywp1 complexed with an N-glycosylated cell wall protein(s) to form supramolecular complexes through disulphide bridges (extractable with beta-mercaptoethanol) or bonded to beta-1,3-glucan (extractable with zymolyase). The lack of a specific morphological phenotype when YWP1 was knocked out by gene disruption might indicate that other proteins present in the cell wall of Y. lipolytica compensated for its loss. In this mutant, the electrophoretic pattern of proteins, detected with polyclonal antibodies against the entire cell wall, was different from that obtained with the parental strain, but sensitivity to calcofluor white, zymolyase and chitinase did not change. Quantitative analysis of fluorescence emitted by cells in the presence of fluorescent wheat germ agglutinin (FITC-WGA) indicated that chitin was organized in the cell wall of the mutant cells in a form different from that in the parental strain."

"14963651","abstracttext","The wheat cultivar Kariega expresses complete adult plant resistance to stripe rust in South Africa. The aim of this investigation was to determine the extent and nature of variability in stripe rust resistance in a population of 150 doubled haploid lines generated from a cross between Kariega and the susceptible cultivar Avocet S. Analysis of field data for adult plant stripe rust resistance identified two major QTLs and two minor QTLs in the resistant cultivar Kariega. The two major QTLs were located on chromosomes 7D ( QYr.sgi-7D) and 2B ( QYr.sgi-2B.1), contributing 29% and 30% to the phenotypic variance, respectively. QYr.sgi-2B.1 is primarily associated with a chlorotic and/or necrotic response, unlike QYr.sgi-7D, which is believed to be the adult plant resistance gene Yr18. These two QTLs for adult plant resistance in Kariega appear to represent different forms of resistance, where QYr.sgi-7D may represent potentially more durable resistance than QYr.sgi-2B.1. Mixture model analysis of the field leaf infection scores suggested a genetic model involving two independent genes combining in a classical, epistatic manner. The results of the QTL analysis demonstrate its higher resolution power compared to the mixture model analysis by detecting the presence of minor QTLs."

"15634199","abstracttext","Polyploids are common and arise frequently by genome duplication (autopolyploids) or interspecific hybridization (allopolyploids). Neoallopolyploids display sterility, lethality, phenotypic instability, gene silencing and epigenetic changes. Little is known about the molecular basis of these phenomena, and how much genomic remodeling happens upon allopolyploidization. Extensive genomic remodeling has been documented in wheat, but little remodeling occurs in cotton. Newly synthesized Arabidopsis allopolyploids, which display phenotypic instability and low fertility, displayed several, possibly related mechanisms that can remodel genomes. We detected transcriptional activity of several transposons although their transposition was limited. One represents a new family of conditionally active En-Spm-like transposons of Arabidopsis thaliana, which underwent remodeling of CG methylation upon allopolyploidization. A random amplified fragment length polymorphism survey suggested remodeling at few, specific loci. Meiotic analyses revealed the appearance of chromosomal fragments in a substantial fraction of anther meiocytes. In several individuals produced by hybrids between the synthetic and a natural allopolyploid pollen viability inversely correlated with meiotic instability. Activity of selected DNA transposons and the possibly related chromosomal breaks could cause changes by inducing translocations and rearrangements."

"15665622","abstracttext","Avemar, a fermented wheat germ extract, has been applied in the supplementary therapy of human cancers. Because tamoxifen is commonly used in the therapy of ER+ breast cancer, in this study the combined effect of tamoxifen and Avemar treatment was investigated on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, in order to detect a possible agonistic or antagonistic action. Cytotoxicity was measured by MTT assay, the percentage of mitoses and apoptotic cells was determined morphologically, apoptosis and S-phase was measured by flow cytometry, and estrogen-receptor activity was determined by semiquantitative measurement of the estrogen-responsive pS2 gene mRNA production. Tamoxifen (1 nM) alone had no effect on the percentage of the apoptotic cell fraction and significantly reduced the percentage of the S-phase, compared to untreated cells. Avemar (625 microg/mL) significantly increased apoptosis after 48 hours of treatment. Tamoxifen together with Avemar significantly increased apoptosis already 24 hours after starting treatment but had only a slight (not significant) effect on mitosis and S-phase. Estrogen-receptor activity of MCF-7 cells was enhanced by Avemar, decreased by tamoxifen, and was further decreased by combined tamoxifen and Avemar treatment. As apoptosis increased when Avemar was added to tamoxifen treatment, the use of supplementary therapy with Avemar in the case of ER+ breast tumors may enhance the therapeutic effects of tamoxifen."

"15666770","abstracttext","Genetic engineering may be used to introduce multiple insect resistance genes with different modes of action into crop plants. We explored the possible interactions of two differing gene products fed in the diet of cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculates (F.), a stored grain pest. The soybean cysteine protease inhibitor soyacystatin N (scN) and alpha-amylase inhibitor (alphaAI) from wheat have defensive function against this coleopteran. When artificial seeds containing both scN and alpha(AI) were infested with eggs of C. maculatus, the delays in larval development were longer than was predicted by summing the developmental delays seen when larvae were fed a diet containing the individual proteins, indicating that the effects of scN and alpha(AI) are synergistic. Alpha(AI) was readily hydrolyzed when incubated with insect gut extract. This proteolytic degradation was inhibited by scN, but not by Kunitz inhibitor (a serine protease inhibitor). Thus, degradation of alpha(AI) was due to proteolysis by insect digestive cysteine proteases. These data suggest that C. maculatus uses digestive enzymes not only to function in food protein digestion but also to defend the insects themselves by helping reduce the concentration of a toxic dietary protein."
"15585663","articletitle","Different patterns in the recognition of editing sites in plant mitochondria."
"15585663","abstracttext","Higher plant mitochondrial mRNAs are extensively modified by highly specific C-to-U conversions. However, the determinants of recognition specificity are, to date, unknown. Here, we analyse the cis-elements involved in the recognition of two editing sites in a cox2 gene in wheat mitochondria. A minimal region of 23 nt was found to be involved in recognition of the editing site C77, similar to our previous report for site C259. These regions were correctly recognized by the mitochondrial editing machinery when placed elsewhere in the transcript. The nearest neighbour residues of the target C play a crucial role in editing, but the nature and position of the residue varies according to the editing site concerned. The target region seems to be formed by two regions 5' and 3', which can be separated by a maximum of two residues. Studies on single residue mutants concerning every position in the 23 nt region indicated that editing sites are affected differently by their neighbouring sequences. These results suggest that, notwithstanding the similar extent and location of cis-elements, the editing site recognition mechanisms may differ in plant mitochondria."
"15605178","articletitle","Identification of a Golgi-localised GRIP domain protein from Arabidopsis thaliana."
"15605178","abstracttext","A family of Golgi-localised molecules was recently described in animals and fungi possessing extensive coiled regions and a short (approximately 40 residues) conserved C-terminal domain, called the GRIP domain, which is responsible for their location to this organelle. Using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified a gene (AtGRIP) encoding a putative GRIP protein. We demonstrated that the C-terminal domain from AtGRIP functions as a Golgi-targeting sequence in plant cells. Localisation studies in living cells expressing the AtGRIP fused to a DsRed2 fluorescent probe, showed extensive co-location with the Golgi marker alpha-mannosidase I in transformed tobacco protoplasts. GRIP-like sequences were also found in genomic databases of rice, maize, wheat and alfalfa, suggesting that this domain may be a useful Golgi marker for immunolocalisation studies. Despite low sequence identity amongst GRIP domains, the plant GRIP sequence was able to target to the Golgi of mammalian cells. Taken together, these data indicate that GRIP domain proteins might be implicated in a targeting mechanism that is conserved amongst eukaryotes."

"15499406","abstracttext","Self incompatibility (SI) in Phalaris coerulescens is gametophytically determined by two unlinked multi allelic loci (S and Z). Neither the S nor Z genes have yet been cloned. As part of a map-based cloning strategy, high-resolution maps of the S and Z regions were generated from distorted segregating populations using RFLP probes from wheat, barley, oat, and Phalaris. The S locus was delimited to 0.26 cM with two boundary markers (Xwg811 and Xpsr168) and cosegregated with Xbm2 and Xbcd762. Xbcd266 was the closest marker linked to Z (0.9 cM). A high level of colinearity in the S and Z regions was found in both self-incompatible and -compatible species. The S locus was localized to the subcentromere region of chromosome 1 and the Z locus to the long arm end of chromosome 2. Several rice BAC clones orthologous to the S and Z locus regions were identified. This opens the possibility of using the rice genome sequence data to generate more closely linked markers and identify SI candidate genes. These results add further support to the conservation of gene order in the S and Z regions of the grass genomes."

"15538559","abstracttext","The main manganese peroxidase (MnP) isoenzyme of Agaricus bisporus ATCC 62459 produced in lignocellulose-containing cultures was isolated, cloned and sequenced. In liquid medium, where MnP was previously detected only in trace amounts, the production of MnP was enhanced by rye and wheat bran supplements. The pI (3.25) and N-terminal amino acid sequence (25 aa) of the enzyme from bran-containing cultures were identical to those reported from compost-isolated MnP1. MnP1 is a 328-aa long polypeptide preceded by a 26-aa leader peptide. The nucleotide sequence and putative amino acid sequence of MnP1 reveal its similarity to Pleurotus ostreatus MnP3 (62.5%), Lepista irina versatile peroxidase (VP) (61.8%) and Pleurotus eryngii VPs VPL2 and VPL1 (61.9% and 61.2%, respectively). The intron-exon structure resembles that of P. ostreatus MnP1 and P. eryngii VPL1. Despite the sequence similarity to VPs, in the A. bisporus MnP1 sequence, alanine (A163) is present instead of tryptophane (W164), distinguishing it from the veratryl alcohol oxidising P. eryngii VPLs. The MnP sequence can be used as a tool to examine the pattern of ligninolytic gene expression during the growth and fruiting of A. bisporus to optimise compost composition, fungal growth and mushroom production."

"15711959","abstracttext","In hexaploid wheat, single-locus and two-locus quantitative trait loci (QTL) analyses for grain protein content (GPC) were conducted using two different mapping populations (PI and PII). Main effect QTLs (M-QTLs), epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) and QTL x environment interactions (QE, QQE) were detected using two-locus analyses in both the populations. Only a few QTLs were common in both the analyses, and the QTLs and the interactions detected in the two populations differed, suggesting the superiority of two-locus analysis and the need for using several mapping populations for QTL analysis. A sizable proportion of genetic variation for GPC was due to interactions (28.59% and 54.03%), rather than to M-QTL effects (7.24% and 7.22%), which are the only genetic effects often detected in the majority of QTL studies. Even E-QTLs made a marginal contribution to genetic variation (2.68% and 6.04%), thus suggesting that the major part of genetic variation is due to changes in gene networks rather than the presence or absence of specific genes. This is in sharp contrast to the genetic dissection of pre-harvest sprouting tolerance conducted by us earlier, where interaction effects were not substantial, suggesting that the nature of genetic variation also depends on the nature of the trait."
"15713746","articletitle","Large-scale chromatin decondensation induced in a developmentally activated transgene locus."
"15713746","abstracttext","The high molecular weight (HMW) glutenin-encoding genes in wheat are developmentally activated in the endosperm at about 8 days after anthesis. We have investigated the physical changes that occur in these genes in two transgenic lines containing about 20 and 50 copies each of the HMW glutenin genes together with their promoters. Using fluorescence in-situ hybridisation (FISH) and confocal imaging, we demonstrate that, in non-expressing tissue, each transgene locus consists of one or two highly condensed sites, which decondense into many foci upon activation of transcription in endosperm nuclei. Initiation of transcription can precede decondensation but not vice versa. We show that, in one of the lines, cytoplasmic transcript levels are high after onset of transcription but disappear by 14 days after anthesis, whereas small interfering RNAs, which indicate post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), are detected at this stage. However, the transcript levels remain high at the transcription sites, most of the transgene copies are transcriptionally active and transcriptional activity in the nucleus ceases only with cell death at the end of endosperm development."

"12493847","abstracttext","The strategy of 'complementation by functional sufficiency' was used to isolate a cDNA designated XVSAP1 from a cDNA library constructed from dehydrated Xerophyta viscosa Baker leaves. Analysis of the cDNA sequence indicated a highly hydrophobic protein with six transmembrane regions. Southern blot analysis revealed that there are at least two copies of XVSAP1 in X. viscosa. The deduced amino acid sequence showed 49% identity to WCOR413, a low-temperature-regulated protein from wheat. The protein also showed between 25% to 56% identity to WCOR413-like proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana. Expression of XVSAP1 in Escherichia coli (srl::Tn10) conferred osmotic stress tolerance when the cells were grown in 1 M sorbitol. Analysis of gene expression using semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that XVSAP1 is induced by dehydration, salt stress (100 mM), both low (4 degrees C) and high temperature (42 degrees C) and high light treatment (1500 micromol m(-2) s(-1)). These results suggest that XVSAP1 may have a significant role to play in the response of X. viscosa to abiotic stresses."

"12409616","abstracttext","We report a cell-free system for the high-throughput synthesis and screening of gene products. The system, based on the eukaryotic translation apparatus of wheat seeds, has significant advantages over other commonly used cell-free expression systems. To maximize the yield and throughput of the system, we optimized the mRNA UTRs, designed an expression vector for large-scale protein production, and developed a new strategy to construct PCR-generated DNAs for high-throughput production of many proteins in parallel. The resulting system achieves high-yield expression and can maintain productive translation for 14 days. Additionally, in the integration of a PCR-directed system for template creation, at least 50 genes can be translated in parallel, yielding between 0.1 and 2.3 mg of protein by one person within 2 days. Assessment of correct protein folding by the products of this high-throughput protein-expression system were performed by enzymatic assays of kinases and by NMR spectroscopic analysis. The cell-free system, reported here, bypasses many of the time-consuming cloning steps of conventional expression systems and lends itself to a robotic automation for the high-throughput expression of proteins."

For all strains, a 550-base portion of the trichodiene synthase gene (tri5) was amplified and sequenced. According to the tri5 data, the F. culmorum strains tested clustered into two groups that correlated with in vitro deoxynivalenol production. For three high-producing and three low-producing F. culmorum strains, the tri5-tri6 intergenic region was then sequenced, which confirmed the two separate clusters within the F. culmorum strains. According to the tri5-tri6 sequence data, specific PCR primers were designed to allow differentiation of high-producing from low-producing F. culmorum strains."

"12237945","abstracttext","Bovine follicle-stimulating hormone (boFSH) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein that belongs to the pituitary gonadotropins. Bioactive FSH is composed of alpha and beta subunits which require extensive N-glycosylation and sialylation. The mammary gland of transgenic livestock is an attractive source for the synthesis of post-translationally modified proteins. Two mammary gland-specific gene constructs with the cDNA for the boFSH alpha (boFSHalpha) and beta (boFSHbeta) subunits controlled by bovine alpha-s1 casein regulatory sequences were co-microinjected into fertilized rabbit oocytes. Two FSHalpha/FSHbeta double transgenic rabbit lines were established. The transgene expression was strictly lactation and mammary gland specific. Protein analysis revealed the presence of the boFSH heterodimer in the milk of transgenic rabbits showing a molecular weight similar to that of purified pituitary gland derived boFSH (boFSH-P). Subunit specific antibodies detected both polypeptides with the expected molecular sizes. Biochemical characterization demonstrated the expected isoelectric points of the recombinant boFSH. The presence of the post-translationally added terminal sialic acid residues was indicated by wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin Western blotting. The biological activity of the recombinant mammary gland produced boFSH was determined using a FSH-dependent reporter cell line. The bioactivity of the recombinant boFSH was comparable to that of purified boFSH-P."

Over 300 isolates of 2,4-DAPG-producing fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from the rhizosphere of pea plants grown in soils that had undergone pea or wheat monoculture and were suppressive to Fusarium wilt or take-all, respectively. Representatives of seven genotypes, A, D, E, L, O, P, and Q, were isolated from both soils and identified by whole-cell repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) with the BOXA1R primer, increasing by three (O, P, and Q) the number of genotypes identified previously among a worldwide collection of 2,4-DAPG producers. Fourteen isolates representing eight different genotypes were tested for their ability to colonize the rhizosphere of pea plants. Population densities of strains belonging to genotypes D and P were significantly greater than the densities of other genotypes and remained above log 6.0 CFU (g of root)(-1) over the entire 15-week experiment.

"12080147","abstracttext","Filamentous fungi within the Fusarium graminearum species complex (Fg complex) are the primary etiological agents of Fusarium head blight (scab) of wheat and barley. Scab is an economically devastating plant disease that greatly limits grain yield and quality. In addition, scabby grain is often contaminated with trichothecene mycotoxins that act as virulence factors on some hosts, and pose a serious threat to animal health and food safety. Strain-specific differences in trichothecene metabolite profiles (chemotypes) are not well correlated with the Fg complex phylogeny based on genealogical concordance at six single-copy nuclear genes. To examine the basis for this discord between species and toxin evolution, a 19-kb region of the trichothecene gene cluster was sequenced in 39 strains chosen to represent the global genetic diversity of species in the Fg complex and four related species of Fusarium. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that polymorphism within these virulence-associated genes is transspecific and appears to have been maintained by balancing selection acting on chemotype differences that originated in the ancestor of this important group of plant pathogens. Chemotype-specific differences in selective constraint and evidence of adaptive evolution within trichothecene genes are also reported."

"12671754","abstracttext","Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers have been used to characterize the genetic diversity among 35 spring wheat cultivars and lines with different levels of Fusarium resistance. The objectives of this study were to determine RAPD-based genetic similarity between accessions and to derive associations between Fusarium head blight (FHB) and RAPD markers. Two bulked DNA from either highly resistant lines or susceptible lines were used to screen polymorphic primers. Out of 160 screened primers, 17 primers generated reproducible and polymorphic fragments. Genetic similarity calculated from the RAPD data ranged from 0.64 to 0.98. A dendrogram was prepared on the basis of a similarity matrix using the UPGMA algorithm, which corresponded well with the results of principal component analysis and separated the 35 genotypes into two groups. Association analysis between RAPD markers and the FHB index detected three RAPD markers, H19(1000), F2(500) and B1(2400), significantly associated with FHB-resistant genotypes. These results suggest that a collection of unrelated genotypes can be used to identify markers linked to an agronomically important quantitative trait like FHB. These markers will be useful for marker-assistant breeding and can be used as candidate markers for further gene mapping and cloning."

Southern blot analysis showed the presence of between about three and twelve transgene insertions. Detailed comparative studies of five null and five homozygous transformed sub-lines from transgenic line A showed that gamma-zein accounted for over 4% of the total prolamin fraction, corresponding to about 1.9% of the total grain N. Comparison of the proteins present in the gel protein fraction demonstrated that the gamma-zein was incorporated into polymers, as in maize. However, there was no effect on grain hardness measured using the Perten Single Kernel Characterisation System or on the vitreousness measured by visual inspection. This contrasts with the situation in maize where a clear association with vitreousness has been reported."
"12602868","articletitle","An interaction between an Arabidopsis poly(A) polymerase and a homologue of the 100 kDa subunit of CPSF."
"12602868","abstracttext","The Arabidopsis genome possesses a number of sequences that are predicted to encode proteins that are similar to mammalian and yeast polyadenylation factor subunits. One of these resides on chromosome V and has the potential to encode a polypeptide related to the 100 kDa subunit of the mammalian cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF). This gene encodes a ca. 2400 nucleotide mRNA that in turn can be translated to yield a polypeptide that is 39% identical to the mammalian CPSF100 protein. Antibodies raised against the Arabidopsis protein recognized distinctive polypeptides in nuclear extracts prepared from pea and wheat germ, consistent with the hypothesis that the Arabidopsis protein is resident in a nuclear polyadenylation complex. Interestingly, the Arabidopsis CPSF100 was found to interact with a portion of a nuclear poly(A) polymerase. This interaction was attributable to a 60 amino acid domain in the CPSF100 polypeptide and the N-terminal 220 amino acids of the poly(A) polymerase. An analogous interaction has yet to be described in other eukaryotes. The interaction with PAP thus indicates that the plant CPSF100 polypeptide is likely part of the 3'-end processing machinery, but suggests that this complex may function differently in plants than it does in mammals and yeast."

"12575794","abstracttext","Fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) of total genomic and repetitive DNA on microsporocytes of ditelocentric addition lines of rye 5RL in hexaploid wheat was performed to study the behaviour of the rye homologous chromosome arms in relation to centromere and telomere dynamics at premeiotic interphase and meiotic prophase I. By comparing isogenic lines with and without the Ph1 locus, we established the effect of the Ph1 gene on appearance and behaviour of the rye chromosomes. Ph1 and ph1b lines demonstrated similar premeiotic chromosome arrangement with the two rye homologues occupying separated domains despite the occurrence of centromere association. Our study confirmed that bouquet arrangement of telomeres follows the Rabl configuration. In cells displaying bouquet clustering of telomeres, centromeres of the 5RL telosomes are still at the opposite pole, suggesting anchoring of centromeres at the cytoskeleton. Once the telomeres complete clustering, the rye centromeres migrate to the telomere pole, and the rye chromosomes begin to loosen their structure. While the rye homologues in the wild-type keep separate territories in the nucleus, they become intermingled in the ph1b mutant, possibly because of their lower condensation. In a subsequent stage, the 5RL homologues appear intimately associated mainly at the distal region. Our study suggests that the lower rate of chromosome synapsis in the ph1b mutant results from abnormal chromatin decondensation and organization."

"12698357","abstracttext","Intraganglionic laminar endings (IGLEs) represent the major vagal afferent structures throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Previous ultrastructural investigations have revealed synaptic contacts of IGLEs on myenteric neurons. Thus, in addtion to functioning probably as mechanosensors, IGLEs may also synaptically influence myenteric neurons. In search of clues for potential transmitters in IGLEs, we investigated, by combined neuronal tracing and immunocytochemistry in the esophagus, the correlation between IGLEs and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), which is considered a reliable marker for glutamatergic neurons. In rat esophagus, IGLEs were immunostained with calretinin. In the mouse, anterograde wheat germ agglutinin/horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) tracing from nodose ganglion was used in order to label esophageal IGLEs. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated that VGLUT2 immunoreactivity was highly colocalized with synaptophysin and that both calretinin and tyramide amplified WGA-HRP in rat and mouse esophagus, respectively. No colocalization was found with calcitonin gene-related peptide, a marker for spinal primary afferents. Thus, VGLUT2 is found in vagal afferent endings in the esophagus, suggesting that glutamate is contained in, and probably released from, synaptic vesicles previously described in IGLEs. Functional evidence pending, this finding is in favor of a local effector function of IGLEs onto myenteric neurons."

"12743752","abstracttext","A well-known industrial fungus for enzyme production, Aspergillus niger, was selected to produce the feruloyl esterase FAEA by homologous overexpression for pulp bleaching application. The gpd gene promoter was used to drive FAEA expression. Changing the nature and concentration of the carbon source nature (maltose to glucose; from 2.5 to 60 g l(-1)), improved FAEA activity 24.5-fold and a yield of 1 g l(-1) of the corresponding protein in the culture medium was achieved. The secreted FAEA was purified 3.5-fold to homogeneity in a two-step purification procedure with a recovery of 69%. The overproduced protein was characterised and presented properties in good agreement with those of native FAEA. The recombinant FAEA was tested for wheat straw pulp bleaching, with or without a laccase mediator system and xylanase. Best results were obtained using a bi-sequential process with a sequence including xylanase, FAEA and laccase, and yielded very efficient delignification--close to 75%--and a kappa number of 3.9. This is the first report on the potential application of recombinant FAEA in the pulp and paper sector."
"12730393","articletitle","Evolution of Wheat streak mosaic virus: dynamics of population growth within plants may explain limited variation."
"12730393","abstracttext","Like many other plant RNA viruses, Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) sequence diversity within and among infected plants is low given the large number of virions produced. This may be explained by considering aspects of plant virus life history. Intracellular replication of RNA viruses is predominately linear, not exponential, which means that the rate at which mutations accumulate also is linear. Bottlenecks during systemic movement further limit diversity. Analysis of mixed infections with two WSMV isolates suggests that about four viral genomes participate in systemic invasion of each tiller. Low effective population size increases the role of stochastic processes on dynamics of plant virus population genetics and evolution. Despite low pair-wise diversity among isolates, the number of polymorphic sites within the U.S. population is about the same as between divergent strains or a sister species. Characteristics of polymorphism in the WSMV coat protein gene suggest that most variation appears neutral."

"12589554","abstracttext","We made an update of the intervarietal molecular marker linkage map of the wheat genome developed using a doubled-haploid (DH) population derived from the cross between the cultivars ""Courtot"" and ""Chinese Spring"". This map was constructed using 187 DH lines and 659 markers. The genome was well covered (more than 95%) except for chromosomes from homoeologous group 4 and chromosomes 5D and 7D, which had gaps slightly larger than 50 cM. A core-map based on a set of 200 anchor loci (one marker each 18.4 cM) was developed. The total length of this map was 3,685 cM which is similar to the size of the international reference map of the ITMI population (3,551 cM). Map coverage was identical for the three genomes (A, B and D) and for the number of anchor loci, as well as for the size of the map. Using this map, QTLs for several agronomic traits were detected on phenotypic data from the population grown in Clermont-Ferrand (France) under natural field conditions over 6 years, and in Norwich (UK) in controlled conditions and under natural field conditions in 1 year. Almost all of the 21 chromosomes were involved in at least one trait. However, several regions seemed to contain gene clusters either for grain traits (and thus bread-making quality) or plant development traits."

"15782178","abstracttext","Structural proteomics requires robust, scalable methods. Here we describe a wheat germ cell-free platform for protein production that supports efficient NMR structural studies of eukaryotic proteins and offers advantages over cell-based methods. To illustrate this platform, we describe its application to a specific target (At3g01050.1) from Arabidopsis thaliana. After cloning the target gene into a specialized plasmid, we carry out a small-scale (50 mul) in vitro sequential transcription and translation trial to ascertain the level of protein production and solubility. Next, we prepare mRNA for use in a 4-ml semicontinuous cell-free translation reaction to incorporate (15)N-labeled amino acids into a protein sample that we purify and test for suitability for NMR structural analysis. We then repeat the cell-free approach with (13)C,(15)N-labeled amino acids to prepare a doubly labeled sample. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of At3g01050.1 shows that this protein is an unusual member of the beta-grasp protein family."

"15753566","abstracttext","The arrangement of chromosome pairs 5RL and 7R added to the wild type and the ph1b mutant line of hexaploid wheat are analyzed in 2N somatic root tip cells during the cell cycle relative to the arrangement that chromosomes 5RL show in 4N tapetal cells produced after colchicine treatment. Both homologous chromosome pairs are identified at interphase and mitosis by fluorescence in situ hybridization. In nuclei at interphase, chromosomes appear as discrete domains that show the Rabl orientation. Homologous chromosomes are predominantly non-associated and their positioning seems not to be influenced by the Ph1 gene that suppresses homoeologous meiotic pairing. This pattern of arrangement contrasts with the high level of somatic pairing that sister chromosomes show in the interphase that follows chromosome duplication induced by colchicine. Disruption of pairing observed in some 4N nuclei is produced at c-anaphase which suggests no topological redistribution of homologues during conformation of the new nucleus. Homologous chromosomes show no predominant arrangement in ellipsoidal metaphase plates, which contrasts with the preferential opposite location of homologues in human prometaphase rosettes. Differences between chromosomes in the variation of the length through the cell cycle and in the chromatin morphology when the Ph1 is absent suggest different patterns of chromatin condensation in both chromosomes."

"15809003","abstracttext","Mycosphaerella graminicola is a major fungal pathogen of wheat as the causal agent of Septoria leaf blotch disease. As a first step toward a greater understanding of the mechanism of host infection we have generated, sequenced, and analyzed three M. graminicola EST libraries from conditions predicted to resemble independent phases of the host infection process, including one library generated from the fungus during interaction with its host. A total of 5180 ESTs were sequenced and clustered into 886 contigs and 2039 singletons to give a set of 2925 unique sequences (unisequences). BLASTX analysis revealed 33% of the unknown M. graminicola unisequences to be orphans. Very limited inter-library overlap of expression was seen with the majority of unisequences (contigs and singletons) being library-specific. Analysis of EST redundancy between libraries demonstrated a significant difference in gene expression in the three conditions. Comparisons made against fully sequenced genomes revealed most M. graminicola sequences to be homologous to genes present in both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Ascomycete filamentous fungi. A range of sequences having significant homology to verified pathogenicity/virulence genes (HvPV-genes) of either plant or mammalian fungal and Oomycete pathogens were also identified (<1e-20). The generation of, and the diversity present within, this EST collection will facilitate future efforts aimed at a more detailed study of the transcriptome of the fungus during host infection."

"15832294","abstracttext","Potentially, autoimmune diseases develop from a combination of multiple genes with allelic polymorphisms. An MRL/Mp-Fas(lpr) (/) (lpr) (MRL/lpr) strain of mice develops autoimmune diseases, including lupus nephritis, but another lpr strain, C3H/HeJ-Fas(lpr) (/) (lpr) (C3H/lpr) does not. This indicates that MRL polymorphic genes are involved in the development of the diseases. By quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis using 527 of the (MRL/lpr x C3H/lpr)F(2) mice, we identified a novel locus for susceptibility to lupus nephritis at map position D5Mit115 on chromosome 5, the same alias of the osteopontin (Opn) gene (LOD score =4.0), susceptible in the MRL allele. In functional analyses of the MRL and C3H Opn alleles using synthetic osteopontin (OPN) made with a new method ""cell-free system"" with wheat germ ribosomes, the MRL-OPN induced higher expression and production of immunoglobulins as well as cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IFN-gamma in splenocytes and/or macrophages than that of the C3H allele. These findings suggest that allelic polymorphism of OPN causes the functional differences in antibody production and macrophage activation between MRL and C3H strains, possibly involved in the development of lupus nephritis."

"15694140","abstracttext","Mutations of the GNE gene are responsible for autosomal recessive hereditary inclusion-body myopathy (HIBM). In this study we searched for the presence of any significant abnormality of alpha-dystroglycan (alpha-DG), a highly glycosylated component of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex, in 5 HIBM patients which were previously clinically and genetically characterized. Immunocytochemical and immunoblot analysis showed that alpha-DG extracted from muscle biopsies was normally expressed and displayed its typical molecular mass. Immunoblot analysis on the wheat germ lectin-enriched glycoprotein fraction of muscles and primary myotubes showed a reduced amount of alpha-DG in 4 out of 5 HIBM patients, compared to normal and other diseased muscles. However, such altered lectin-binding behaviour, possibly reflecting a partial hyposialylation of alpha-DG, did not affect the laminin binding properties of alpha-DG. Therefore, the subtle changes within the alpha-DG glycosylation pattern, detected in HIBM muscles, likely do not play a key pathogenic role in this disorder."

"16024367","abstracttext","Habitats in agroecosystems are ephemeral, and are characterized by frequent disturbances forcing pest species to successively colonize various hosts belonging either to the cultivated or to the uncultivated part of the agricultural landscape. The role of wild habitats as reservoirs or refuges for the aphid Sitobion avenae that colonize cultivated fields was assessed by investigating the genetic structure of populations collected on both cereal crops (wheat, barley and oat) and uncultivated hosts (Yorkshire fog, cocksfoot, bulbous oatgrass and tall oatgrass) in western France. Classical genetic analyses and Bayesian clustering algorithms indicate that genetic differentiation is high between populations collected on uncultivated hosts and on crops, revealing a relatively limited gene flow between the uncultivated margins and the cultivated part of the agroecosystem. A closer genetic relatedness was observed between populations living on plants belonging to the same tribe (Triticeae, Poeae and Aveneae tribes) where aphid genotypes appeared not to be specialized on a single host, but rather using a group of related plant species. Causes of this ecological differentiation and its implications for integrated pest management of S. avenae as cereals pest are discussed."

"16040595","abstracttext","To search for restriction endonucleases, we used a novel plant-based cell-free translation procedure that bypasses the toxicity of these enzymes. To identify candidate genes, the related genomes of the hyperthermophilic archaea Pyrococcus abyssi and Pyrococcus horikoshii were compared. In line with the selfish mobile gene hypothesis for restriction-modification systems, apparent genome rearrangement around putative restriction genes served as a selecting criterion. Several candidate restriction genes were identified and then amplified in such a way that they were removed from their own translation signal. During their cloning into a plasmid, the genes became connected with a plant translation signal. After in vitro transcription by T7 RNA polymerase, the mRNAs were separated from the template DNA and translated in a wheat-germ-based cell-free protein synthesis system. The resulting solution could be directly assayed for restriction activity. We identified two deoxyribonucleases. The novel enzyme was denoted as PabI, purified and found to recognize 5'-GTAC and leave a 3'-TA overhang (5'-GTA/C), a novel restriction enzyme-generated terminus. PabI is active up to 90 degrees C and optimally active at a pH of around 6 and in NaCl concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 mM. We predict that it has a novel 3D structure."

"14648117","abstracttext","The presence of cotton ( Gossypium hirsutum L.) fiber transcripts coding for a germin-like protein (GLP) was revealed by differential display analysis in which early stages of cotton fiber development between a wild type line, Texas Marker-1 (TM1) and a near isogenic mutant, Naked Seed (N1) were compared. Transcripts of the cotton GLP ( GhGLP1) accumulated specifically in TM1, but did not accumulate in the mutant although the GhGLP1 gene was present in both lines. The deduced protein sequence of GhGLP1 is similar to Prunus persica auxin-binding proteins, a barley ADP-glucose pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase and two different classes of hydrogen peroxide-producing enzymes: wheat germin oxalate oxidase and moss extracellular Mn-superoxide dismutase. Cotton GLPs constitute a multigene family like those of Arabidopsis, rice, soybean, and barley. GhGLP1 transcripts accumulated to their highest levels during the period of fiber expansion, followed by a sharp decline when the rate of cell expansion decreased. While germins and GLPs appear to be involved in defense mechanisms in some plants, both biotic and abiotic stress down-regulated the expression of GhGLP1. Numerous functions have been proposed for dicot GLPs. However, to date, there is little direct evidence for how these proteins function in vivo. The association of maximal GhGLP1 expression with stages of maximal cotton fiber elongation suggests that some GLPs may be important for cell wall expansion."

"14506046","abstracttext","Necrotic enteritis (NE) is a worldwide poultry disease caused by the alpha toxin-producing bacterium Clostridium perfringens. Disease risk factors include concurrent coccidial infection and the dietary use of cereal grains high in nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), such as wheat, barley, rye, and oats. Outbreaks of NE can be prevented or treated by the use of in-feed antibiotics. However, the current debate regarding the prophylactic use of antibiotics in animal diets necessitates a better understanding of factors that influence intestinal colonization by C. perfringens as well as the pathophysiological consequences of its growth. We report a study with a chick model of NE, which used molecular (16S rRNA gene [16S rDNA]) and culture-based microbiological techniques to investigate the impact of the macrolide antibiotic tylosin phosphate (100 ppm) and a dietary NSP (pectin) on the community structure of the small intestinal microbiota relative to colonization by C. perfringens. The effects of tylosin and pectin on mucolytic activity of the microbiota and C. perfringens colonization and their relationship to pathological indices of NE were of particular interest. The data demonstrate that tylosin reduced the percentage of mucolytic bacteria in general and the concentration of C. perfringens in particular, and these responses correlated in a temporal fashion with a reduction in the occurrence of NE lesions and an improvement in barrier function. The presence of pectin did not significantly affect the variables measured. Thus, it appears that tylosin can control NE through its modulation of C. perfringens colonization and the mucolytic activity of the intestinal microbiota."

"14574453","abstracttext","The low-molecular-weight (LMW) glutenin subunits are components of the highly cross-linked glutenin polymers that confer viscoelastic properties to gluten and dough. They have both quantitative and qualitative effects on dough quality that may relate to differences in their ability to form the inter-chain disulphide bonds that stabilise the polymers. In order to determine the relationship between dough quality and the amounts and properties of the LMW subunits, we have transformed the pasta wheat cultivars Svevo and Ofanto with three genes encoding proteins, which differ in their numbers or positions of cysteine residues. The transgenes were delivered under control of the high-molecular-weight (HMW) subunit 1Dx5 gene promoter and terminator regions, and the encoded proteins were C-terminally tagged by the introduction of the c-myc epitope. Stable transformants were obtained with both cultivars, and the use of a specific antibody to the c-myc epitope tag allowed the transgene products to be readily detected in the complex mixture of LMW subunits. A range of transgene expression levels was observed. The addition of the epitope tag did not compromise the correct folding of the trangenic subunits and their incorporation into the glutenin polymers. Our results demonstrate that the ability to specifically epitope-tag LMW glutenin transgenes can greatly assist in the elucidation of their individual contributions to the functionality of the complex gluten system."

The role of gliadin in eliciting immune responses in CD is still partly unclear; however, the occurrence of anti-gliadin in the sera of patients suffering from CD correlates well with clinical symptoms. In this work we report the construction of isotype-specific, phage-displayed scFv libraries from peripheral blood lymphocytes of a patient with CD and from a healthy control individual. VH and VL chains were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using a set of oligonucleotides recognizing all human variable gene families. The three scFv libraries (IgA, IgG and IgM) were selectively enriched for gliadin-binding phage. After four rounds of affinity selection, polyclonal enrichment of gliadin-binding phage was observed in all libraries from the CD patient but in none from the healthy donor. Phagemid particles generated from single clones were demonstrated to be gliadin-specific, as shown by strongly positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and BiaCore signals. The VH and VL chains from samples of these monoclonal isotype-specific phage were sequenced to identify the most common variable regions used by the immune system to elicit antibody responses against gliadin."

"18397370","abstracttext","Two novel rice cold shock domain (CSD) proteins were cloned and characterized under different stress treatments and during various stages of development. OsCSP1 and OsCSP2 (Oryza sativa CSD protein) encode putative proteins consisting of an N-terminal CSD and glycine-rich regions that are interspersed by 4 and 2 CX(2)CX(4)HX(4)C (CCHC) retroviral-like zinc fingers, respectively. In vivo functional analysis confirmed that OsCSPs can complement a cold-sensitive bacterial strain which lacks four endogenous cold shock proteins. In vitro ssDNA binding assays determined that recombinant OsCSPs are capable of functioning as nucleic acid-binding proteins. Both OsCSP transcripts are transiently up-regulated in response to low-temperature stress and rapidly return to a basal level of gene expression. Protein blot analysis determined that OsCSPs are maintained at a constant level subsequent to a cold treatment lasting over a period of several days. Both the transcript and protein data are in sharp contrast to those previously obtained for winter wheat WCSP1. A time-coursed study through various stages of rice development confirmed that both OsCSP proteins and transcripts are highly accumulated in reproductive tissues and tissues which exhibit meristematic activity."

Colon digesta samples were collected on day 39 and subjected to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene fragments. DGGE fingerprint diversity indices differed between the group treated with amoxicillin and the untreated group (0.8+/-0.19 and 1.03+/-0.17, respectively, P=0.012). Reamplification and sequencing of two bands present in all samples revealed that a Roseburia faecalis-related population was strongly reduced in relative abundance (98% identity) in the treated group, while an enterobacterial population with 100% identity to Shigella spp., Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi was enriched. A band corresponding to Lactobacillus sobrius was present only in the control group.

A wealth of information is now available that furthers our understanding regarding the spatial and temporal regulation of expression of Puroindoline genes. Through the use of model membranes and synthetic peptides we also have a clearer understanding of the significance of the cysteine backbone, the tryptophan-rich domain (TRD) and the helicoid tertiary structures of PIN proteins in relation to their membrane-active properties. Many studies suggest individual yet co-operative modes of action of the PIN proteins in determining kernel texture, and significant evidence is accumulating that the proteins have in vivo and in vitro antimicrobial activities, shedding light on the biological roles of this unique ensemble of proteins.

Due to earlier detection and increased awareness, celiac disease now presents with a myriad of ""atypical"" signs and symptoms such as iron-deficiency anemia and osteoporosis. Associated conditions include T-cell lymphoma, dermatitis herpetiformis, autoimmune thyroiditis and type 1 diabetes. Diagnosis requires serologic confirmation with either antiendomysial or antitransglutaminase antibodies as well as histologic confirmation from endoscopic small bowel biopsy.

"18469980","abstracttext","Resistance to common root rot and black point, caused by Cochliobolus sativus, was evaluated in alien chromosome substitution and addition lines of the cultivars 'Cadet' and 'Rescue'. Substitution of chromosome 5B in 'Rescue' with 5Ag from Agropyron elongatum decreased root rot susceptibility to a level intermediate between that in the susceptible 'Rescue' and the resistant 'Cadet'. The substitution of 'Rescue' chromosome 5A or 5D with 5Ag, or the addition of 5Ag to 'Rescue' complement had no consistent effect on root rot susceptibility. The root rot resistance of 'Cadet' was unaffected by substitution of chromosomes 5A, 5B, or 5D with 5Ag, or the addition of 5Ag. This indicates that the susceptible allele of the gene Crr is the primary determinant in the reaction of wheat to common root rot. Black point resistance in the susceptible cultivar 'Rescue' was significantly increased by substitution of chromosome 5B with 5Ag, or the addition of 5Ag. No corresponding effect was demonstrated for black point incidence in the moderately resistant cultivar 'Cadet' with substitution of chromosome 5Ag for 5B, or the addition of 5Ag. Chromosome 5Ag apparently carries one or more genes conferring resistance to black point. The identity of these lines was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using group 5 chromosome arm specific probes. This extends the use of these molecular probes to the Agropyron genome."

"18470026","abstracttext","The effect of the 1RS chromosome arm from rye on plant regeneration from microspore-derived embryos was studied using anther culture technology with genotypes carrying the 1BL-1RS translocated chromosomes, the normal wheat chromosome 1BL-1BS, and ditelosomic lines DT 1BS and DT 1BL. A significant difference was observed in microspore-derived green plants between chromosome structure concerned with 1RS and 1BS arms. An analysis of the inheritance of the 1B-1R translocation was performed on the basis of the frequency of male gametes 1BL-1RS in the microspore-derived green plants and that of the 1B-1R translocation inherited through the pollen or the egg cell from structurally heterozygous hybrids 1BL-1BS/1BL-1RS. Both the normal 1B and the translocated 1BL-1RS chromosomes were sexually transmitted through the pollen grains with the same frequency. The 1BL-1RS chromosome is only transmitted through 45% of the egg cells. On the contrary, two-thirds of the microspore-derived green plants regenerated from the anther culture experiments possess the translocated chromosome. The involvement of the rye chromosome arm 1RS from 'Aurora' on regeneration capacity of the microspore-derived embryos has been proposed through the effect of a ""gametophytic gene."""

"15128038","abstracttext","The effect of Cereal cyst nematode (Heterodera avenae) infection on the expression of putative root defence-related enzymes, peroxidase (PER), esterase (EST) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), was studied in roots of a wheat/Aegilops triuncialis introgression line TR-3531 carrying the Cre7 resistance gene. We analysed detoxificant isozyme changes within roots of the resistant line and their susceptible parent (H-10-15) as a control, during the early interaction with the pathotype Ha71 of H. avenae. Isoelectrofocusing (IEF) isozyme analysis, four and seven days after infection, revealed that PER, EST and SOD activities increased in the resistant line TR-3531 in comparison with the susceptible control. Moreover, four and seven days after infection, the TR-3531 line showed the expression of new PER isozymes, with pIs of 9.7, 9.0, 8.5, 6.5 and 5.0, and an increased activity of some constitutive isoforms. The intensity of some EST and SOD constitutive bands increased in the resistant line after infection. However, no new isoforms were detected for EST and SOD systems. Nematode-induced enzyme activity was minor (PER) or did not occur (EST and SOD) in the compatible interaction with H-10-15. The enhanced peroxidase and esterase activities may play a role in the lignification of cell walls, which assists in the resistance to penetration by the nematode."

"15141952","abstracttext","BAX inhibitor-1 (BI-1) proteins have been characterized as suppressors of programmed cell death in mammals and plants. The barley BI-1 is a suppressor of nonspecific background resistance and mlo-mediated penetration resistance to the biotrophic fungal pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei when overexpressed in epidermal cells of barley. We report here that BI-1 expression is also slightly up-regulated during interaction with the inappropriate wheat pathogen Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. Significantly, overexpression of BI-1 in single epidermal cells of barley by microprojectile-mediated transformation rendered cells susceptible to penetration by inappropriate B. graminis f. sp. tritici. The degree of transgene-induced accessibility to B. graminis f. sp. tritici was thereby similar to the effect achieved by overexpression of the defense suppressor gene Mlo and could not be further enhanced by double expression of both BI-1 and Mlo. Confocal laser scanning microscopy was used to locate a functional green fluorescing GFP:BI-1 fusion protein in endomembranes and the nuclear envelope of barley epidermal cells. Together, enhanced expression of barley BI-1 suppresses penetration resistance to B. graminis f. sp. tritici, linking barley nonhost resistance with cell death regulation."

"15002667","abstracttext","A full-length cDNA, designated BpHi008A, was cloned representing a rice (Oryza sativa) mRNA that accumulates after brown planthopper (BPH) Nilapar vata lugens Stål feeding. The cDNA encodes a putative 82 amino acid protein (BpHi008A) exhibiting about 37% amino acid sequence identity to Wir1 family of proteins that are encoded by pathogen-induced transcripts in wheat. Like Wir1 proteins, it consists of a hydrophobic N-terminal half and a hydrophilic C-terminal half relatively rich in glycine and proline. These proteins are predicted to be integrated into the membrane, with the C-terminus being extracytoplastic. Genomic Southern analysis indicated that the BpHi008A gene was present as a single-copy sequence in the rice genome. Temporal and spatial studies showed that BpHi008A were systemically induced in rice when 2nd and 3rd-instars were feeding. The BpHi008A transcripts level was also increased in seedlings damaged by mechanical wounding. These data indicated that BphHi008A was implicated in the response of rice plants to BPH feeding and wounding."

"15007730","abstracttext","Eukaryotic type I DNA topoisomerases catalyze the relaxation of supercoiled DNA, and play a critical role in DNA replication, transcription and recombination. They are highly conserved, both in sequence and mechanism of activity, from yeast to mammalian cells. We tested the effect of human topoisomerase I (hTOP1) on illegitimate insertion in yeast by expressing the hTOP1 gene in top1Delta yeast ( ytop1Delta) cells. hTOP1 increased the frequency of illegitimate recombination into genomic DNA by 20- to 90-fold relative to the level in ytop1Delta cells, while it had no effect on homologous integration. The addition of the topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin blocked this increase in the level of illegitimate insertion. The expression of hTOP1 also significantly enhanced the fraction of integration events in ribosomal DNA (rDNA)-from 16% to 60%, indicating that the rDNA is a highly preferred target for hTOP1. Integrations occurred at the consensus sequence 5' (T/A) (G/C/A) (T/A) (T/C/A) 3' in hTOP1 expressing cells. A similar preferred break-site consensus sequence was previously identified in vitro for topoisomerases from rat liver and wheat germ."

The 4 enzymes were added to the negative control diet at 3 levels each (150, 450, and 1,250 U/kg), and all diets were pelleted above 80 degrees C. Broiler chicks were fed experimental diets from 4 to 21 d. Chick performance and nutrient digestibility showed that the pel leting process inactivated enzymes A and C and the commercial enzyme. When added to the negative control diet, enzyme B had positive effects on broiler performance and calcium and phosphorus digestibility, and increasing levels of enzyme had greater positive effects. Enzyme B also increased the AME and protein digestibility over those of either control diet. These results suggest that enzyme B was not inactivated by pelleting above 80 degrees C, whereas the other enzymes were."

"15107503","abstracttext","Graminaceous monocots, including most of the world's staple grains (i.e. rice, corn, and wheat) use a chelation strategy (Strategy II) for primary acquisition of iron from the soil. Strategy II plants secrete phytosiderophores (PS), compounds of the mugineic acid family that form stable Fe(III) chelates in soil. Uptake of iron-PS chelates, which occurs through specific transporters at the root surface, thus represents the primary route of iron entry into Strategy II plants. The gene Yellow stripe1 (Ys1) encodes the Fe(III)-PS transporter of maize (Zea mays). Here the physiological functions performed by maize YS1 were further defined by examining the pattern of Ys1 mRNA and protein accumulation and by defining YS1 transport specificity in detail. YS1 is able to translocate iron that is bound either by PS or by the related compound, nicotianamine; thus, the role of YS1 may be to transport either of these complexes. Ys1 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels responds rapidly to changes in iron availability but is not strongly affected by limitation of copper or zinc. Our data provide no support for the idea that YS1 is a transporter of zinc-PS, based on YS1 biochemical activity and Ys1 mRNA expression patterns in response to zinc deficiency. YS1 is capable of transporting copper-PS, but expression data suggest that the copper-PS uptake has limited significance in primary uptake of copper."

The gene organization of these segments is similar to that of other known tenuiviruses, each displaying an ambisense coding strategy. IWSV segments, however, are different from those of other viruses with respect to the number of nucleotides and deduced amino acid sequence for each ORF. Depending on the segment, the first 16-22 nt at the 5' end and the first 16 nt at the 3' end are highly conserved among IWSV and rice hoja blanca virus (RHBV), rice stripe virus (RSV) and maize stripe virus (MStV). In addition, the first 15-18 nt at the 5' end are complementary to the first 16-18 nt at the 3' end. Phylogenetic analyses showed close similarity and a common ancestor for IWSV, RHBV, and Echinochloa hoja blanca virus (EHBV).

It had a pH optimum of 4.6 and a pH 3.4-6.4 stability range. The temperature optimum was 50 degrees C with stability <or=50 degrees C. The enzyme showed considerable loss of activity when incubated with glucose (44%), glucosamine (68%), galactose (22%), and xylose (64%). The addition of Mn++ activated the enzyme by 45%, while Li+, Zn++, Mg++, Cu+, Ca++, and EDTA had no effect. The enzyme hydrolyzed amylopectin at rates 1.5 and 8.0 times that of soluble starch and amylose, respectively. Soluble starch was hydrolyzed 16 and 29 times faster than wheat and corn starch granules, respectively, with the hydrolysis of starch granules using 10x the amount of GLA.

"16489429","abstracttext","Winterhardiness has three primary components: photoperiod (day length) sensitivity, vernalization response, and low temperature tolerance. Photoperiod and vernalization regulate the vegetative to reproductive phase transition, and photoperiod regulates expression of key vernalization genes. Using two barley mapping populations, we mapped six individual photoperiod response QTL and determined their positional relationship to the phytochrome and cryptochrome photoreceptor gene families and the vernalization regulatory genes HvBM5A, ZCCT-H, and HvVRT-2. Of the six photoreceptors mapped in the current study (HvPhyA and HvPhyB to 4HS, HvPhyC to 5HL, HvCry1a and HvCry2 to 6HS, and HvCry1b to 2HL), only HvPhyC coincided with a photoperiod response QTL. We recently mapped the candidate genes for the 5HL VRN-H1 (HvBM5A) and 4HL VRN-H2 (ZCCT-H) loci, and in this study, we mapped HvVRT-2, the barley TaVRT-2 ortholog (a wheat flowering repressor regulated by vernalization and photoperiod) to 7HS. Each of these three vernalization genes is located in chromosome regions determining small photoperiod response QTL effects. HvBM5A and HvPhyC are closely linked on 5HL and therefore are currently both positional candidates for the same photoperiod effect. The coincidence of photoperiod-responsive vernalization genes with photoperiod QTL suggests vernalization genes should also be considered candidates for photoperiod effects."

Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), specifically binding to N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and sialic acid, both of which were abundantly observed in the nasal cavity, was selected as a model lectin. The WGA-conjugated nanoparticles were prepared by incorporating maleimide in the PLA-PEG molecular and taking advantage of its thiol group binding reactivity to conjugate with 2-iminothialane thiolated WGA. Coupling of WGA with the PEG-PLA nanoparticles was confirmed by the existence of gold-labeled WGA-NP under TEM. The retention of biorecognitive activity of WGA after the covalent coupling procedure was confirmed by haemagglutination test. The resulting nanoparticles presented negligible nasal ciliatoxicity and the brain uptake of a fluorescent marker-coumarin carried by WGA functionized nanoparticles was about 2 folds in different brain tissues compared with that of coumarin incorporated in the unmodified ones. Thus, the technique offered a novel effective noninvasive system for brain drug delivery, especially for brain protein and gene delivery."

"16730127","abstracttext","Flavonoid compounds are ubiquitous in nature. They constitute an important part of the human diet and act as active principles of many medicinal plants. Their O-methylation increases their lipophilicity and hence, their compartmentation and functional diversity.

The recombinant TaOMT2 protein was purified to near homogeneity and tested for its substrate preference against a number of phenolic compounds. Enzyme assays and kinetic analyses indicate that TaOMT2 exhibits a pronounced preference for the flavone, tricetin and gives rise to three methylated enzyme reaction products that were identified by TLC, HPLC and ESI-MS/MS as its mono-, di- and trimethyl ether derivatives. The sequential order of tricetin methylation by TaOMT2 is envisaged to proceed via its 3'-mono--->3',5'-di--->3',4',5'-trimethyl ether derivatives. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a gene product that catalyzes three sequential O-methylations of a flavonoid substrate."

"16775402","abstracttext","The leaf chlorosis in the wheat genotype AIM9 was demonstrated to be controlled by a single recessive gene, which was designated as CD5. Significant difference in physiological and yield indices between chlorotic and non-chlorotic plants were observed in 10 F3 segregating families of the cross combination CN17/AIM9. Correlation analysis of both chlorotic plants and plants staying green of the F3 populations revealed that there was a significant positive correlation between yield index values and the physiological indices net photosynthetic rate (P(n)), stomatal conductance (G(s)), and chlorophyll (Chl), as well as a significant negative correlation between yield index values and the physiological indices intercellular CO2 concentration (C(i)) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Observation using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found the irreversible centripetal movement of chloroplasts in chlorotic plants, as a result occurred in three sequential events: (1) chloroplast positions changed from face position (with long axis of chloroplasts at the cell walls perpendicular to light ray) to profile position (with long axis chloroplasts near the cell walls parallel to light ray), (2) chloroplast shapes changed from long elliptical to circular, (3) chloroplasts were separated from the cell wall and moved to the center of the cell."

"16820241","abstracttext","By combining a homologous recombinant gene expression system and optimization of the culture conditions, hyper overproduction of Pleurtous ostreatus MnP2 was achieved. Genetically modified P. ostreatus strains with the recombinant mnp2 sequence under the control of sdi1 expression signals, were subjected to agitated culture using media supplemented with wheat bran or its hot-water extract. The best result, whereby 7300 U/l of MnP was produced by a recombinant strain TM2-18, indicated that more than 30-fold overproduction of the recombinant MnP2 compared to the previous result was achieved. On the other hand, no MnP activity was detected for the wild-type strain under the same conditions. Accumulation of the recombinant, but not endogenous, mnp2 transcripts was demonstrated in reverse-transcription PCR experiments. These results indicated that the recombinant MnP2 was exclusively expressed by the recombinant strain. Purified recombinant MnP2 showed almost identical properties to native MnP2 in electrophoresis, spectroscopic and kinetic analyses, including determination of K(m) and V(max) values for Mn(II), H(2)O(2) and veratryl alcohol. Moreover, the recombinant MnP2 directly oxidized a high-molecularweight substrate RNase A in the absence of redox mediators, as does native MnP2. The homologous overproduction system will provide a plat form for exclusive production of mutant or variant peroxidases with a desired property in basidiomycete."

The ESTs had an average trimmed length of 650 bp. Blast nucleotide alignments against SwissProt and GenBank non-redundant databases were performed and a total of 99.9% of the ESTs were found to have some similarity to existing protein or nucleotide sequences. Tentative functional classification of 77% of the sequences was possible by association with gene ontology or clusters of orthologous group's index descriptors. To demonstrate the utility of this EST collection for studying cell wall composition, we identified homologs for the genes involved in the biosynthesis of lignin subunits. A subset of the ESTs was used for phylogenetic analysis that reinforced the close relationship of Brachypodium to wheat and barley."

Field inoculation experiments had revealed more consistent plant growth stimulation using A. brasilense strain Sp245 as compared with the strain Sp7. Therefore, the in situ expression of the key gene ipdC (indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase) was examined in these two strains. Within the ipdC promoter of strain Sp245 a region of 150 bases was identified, which was missing in strain Sp7. Thus, three different translational ipdC promoter fusions with gfpmut3 were constructed on plasmid level: the first contained the part of the Sp245 promoter region homologous to strain Sp7, the second was bearing the complete promoter region of Sp245 including the specific insertion and the third comprised the Sp7 promoter region. By comparing the fluorescence levels of these constructs after growth on mineral medium with and without inducing amino acids, it could be demonstrated that ipdC expression in A. brasilense Sp245 was subject to a stricter control compared with strain Sp7. Microscopic detection of these reporter strains colonizing the rhizoplane documented for the first time an in situ expression of ipdC."

"16247557","abstracttext","Wheat seedling grown with their shoot bottom exposed to red light (400 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) either with constant illumination or light-dark cycles did not accumulate chlorophyll. This near-etiolation response was manifested by a critical threshold intensity of red light and did not need continuous illumination. The inhibition of the greening process resulted from reduced synthesis of glutamate-1-semialdehyde and consequent reduction in tetrapyrrole precursor 5-aminolevulinic acid. Red light perceived by the shoot bottom down regulated the protein and/or gene expression of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tetrapyrroles. The contents of endogenous cytokinins, i.e., isopentenyl-adenosine and dihydrozeatinriboside, were reduced in seedlings grown in red light having their shoot bottom exposed. Application of exogenous cytokinin and its analogue to roots of seedlings grown in red light reversed the down regulation of the greening process. The reversal of red-light-induced near-etiolation morphogenesis by far-red (200 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) or blue (25 mumol m(-2) s(-1)) light suggests that it could be a very high red-irradiance response of phytochrome, in the meristematic layers of the shoot bottom, that works in concert with blue light receptor(s)."

"16079235","abstracttext","Association mapping is a method for detection of gene effects based on linkage disequilibrium (LD) that complements QTL analysis in the development of tools for molecular plant breeding. In this study, association mapping was performed on a selected sample of 95 cultivars of soft winter wheat. Population structure was estimated on the basis of 36 unlinked simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The extent of LD was estimated on chromosomes 2D and part of 5A, relative to the LD observed among unlinked markers. Consistent LD on chromosome 2D was <1 cM, whereas in the centromeric region of 5A, LD extended for approximately 5 cM. Association of 62 SSR loci on chromosomes 2D, 5A, and 5B with kernel morphology and milling quality was analyzed through a mixed-effects model, where subpopulation was considered as a random factor and the marker tested was considered as a fixed factor. Permutations were used to adjust the threshold of significance for multiple testing within chromosomes. In agreement with previous QTL analysis, significant markers for kernel size were detected on the three chromosomes tested, and alleles potentially useful for selection were identified. Our results demonstrated that association mapping could complement and enhance previous QTL information for marker-assisted selection."

This suppressive soil was subjected to various temperature, fumigation and dilution treatments, planted with tomato, and infested with 1,000 eggs of M. incognita/100 cm(3) soil. Eight weeks after nematode infestation, distinct differences in nematode population densities were observed among the soil treatments, suggesting the suppressiveness had a biological nature. A fungal rRNA gene analysis (OFRG) performed on M. incognita egg masses collected at the end of the greenhouse experiments identified 11 fungal phylotypes, several of which exhibited associations with one or more of the nematode population density measurements (egg masses, eggs or J2). The phylotype containing rRNA genes with high sequence identity to Pochonia chlamydosporia exhibited the strongest negative associations. The negative correlation between the densities of the P. chlamydosporia genes and the nematodes was corroborated by an analysis using a P. chlamydosporia-selective qPCR assay."

"19009441","abstracttext","A method is described for the floral transformation of wheat using a protocol similar to the floral dip of Arabidopsis. This method does not employ tissue culture of dissected embryos, but instead pre-anthesis spikes with clipped florets at the early, mid to late uninucleate microspore stage are dipped in Agrobacterium infiltration media harboring a vector carrying anthocyanin reporters and the NPTII selectable marker. T1 seeds are examined for color changes induced in the embryo by the anthocyanin reporters. Putatively transformed seeds are germinated and the seedlings are screened for the presence of the NPTII gene based on resistance to paromomycin spray and assayed with NPTII ELISAs. Genomic DNA of putative transformants is digested and analyzed on Southern blots for copy number to determine whether the T-DNA has integrated into the nucleus and to show the number of insertions. The nonoptimized transformation efficiencies range from 0.3 to 0.6% (number of transformants/number of florets dipped) but the efficiencies are higher in terms of the number of transformants produced/number of seeds set ranging from 0.9 to 10%. Research is underway to maximize seed set and optimize the protocol by testing different Agrobacterium strains, visual reporters, vectors, and surfactants."

"19034409","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Soissons is one of the most resistant varieties grown in UK. The current study was undertaken to identify QTL for FHB resistance in Soissons and to determine whether the semi-dwarfing alleles Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b have a similar influence on susceptibility to FHB. A Soissons (Rht-B1b; Rht-D1a) x Orvantis (Rht-B1a; Rht-D1b) doubled haploid (DH) population was assessed for FHB resistance in three trials. Soissons contributed a single, stable major FHB QTL linked to the Rht-D1 locus. In contrast, the Rht-B1b allele (contributed by Soissons) conferred no negative effect on FHB resistance, even conferring a very minor positive effect in one trial. The influence of the Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b alleles on FHB resistance was further investigated using both Mercia and Maris Huntsman near-isogenic lines. Under high disease pressure both Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b significantly decreased Type 1 resistance (resistance to initial infection). However, whilst Rht-D1b has no effect on Type 2 resistance (resistance to spread of the fungus within the spike), Rht-B1b significantly increased Type 2 resistance. Our study demonstrates that the choice of semi-dwarfing gene used in plant breeding programmes may be a significant consideration where resistance to FHB is an important breeding target."

Our results indicate that the genetic structure of these M. graminicola populations were stable over the 6-year period. The common alleles at each RFLP locus were present at similar frequencies each year. More than 99% of gene diversity was distributed within populations sampled from the same year and less than 1% was attributed to differences among years. The lack of population differentiation among collections taken in different years indicated that the effective size of the source population was sufficiently large that genetic drift was insignificant in this location. It also suggests that the initial colonists from ascospore founder populations were a fair reflection of the source population. We estimate that the effective sizes of these field populations ranged from 3,400 to 700,000 individuals, depending on the size of the field sampled and assumptions about mutation rates. Estimates of the number of ascospores initiating epidemics of leaf blotch disease in each field plot and factors that contribute to the large effective population size of M. graminicola are discussed."

"18944812","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs) are the most serious and widespread viruses of oats, barley, and wheat worldwide. Natural resistance is inadequate. Toward overcoming this limitation, we engineered virus-derived transgenic resistance in oat. Oat plants were transformed with the 5' half of the BYDV strain PAV genome, which includes the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. In experiments on T2- and T3-generation plants descended from the same transformation event, all BYDV-inoculated plants containing the transgene showed disease symptoms initially, but recovered, flowered, and produced seed. In contrast, all but one of the BYDV-PAV-inoculated nontransgenic segregants died before reaching 25 cm in height. Although all of the recovered transgenic plants looked similar, the amount of virus and viral RNA ranged from substantial to undetectable levels. Thus, the transgene may act either by restricting virus accumulation or by a novel transgenic tolerance phenomenon. This work demonstrates a strategy for genetically stable transgenic resistance to BYDVs that should apply to all hosts of the virus."

"19073703","abstracttext","Completion of human genome sequencing has greatly accelerated functional genomic research. Full-length cDNA clones are essential experimental tools for functional analysis of human genes. In one of the projects of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) in Japan, the full-length human cDNA sequencing project (FLJ project), nucleotide sequences of approximately 30 000 human cDNA clones have been analyzed. The Gateway system is a versatile framework to construct a variety of expression clones for various experiments. We have constructed 33 275 human Gateway entry clones from full-length cDNAs, representing to our knowledge the largest collection in the world. Utilizing these clones with a highly efficient cell-free protein synthesis system based on wheat germ extract, we have systematically and comprehensively produced and analyzed human proteins in vitro. Sequence information for both amino acids and nucleotides of open reading frames of cDNAs cloned into Gateway entry clones and in vitro expression data using those clones can be retrieved from the Human Gene and Protein Database (HGPD, http://www.HGPD.jp). HGPD is a unique database that stores the information of a set of human Gateway entry clones and protein expression data and helps the user to search the Gateway entry clones."

"18931600","abstracttext","The clinical expression of allergic disease is the consequence of a series of complex gene-environment interactions that occur at the materno-fetal interface and throughout infancy, leading to persistence of the Th2 immune response. It has been proposed that atopic eczema is the cutaneous manifestation of a systemic disorder that also gives rise to asthma, food allergy, and allergic rhinitis. The recent emergence of genes regulating epidermal barrier function has raised the question of whether the skin barrier in atopic eczema is defective from the outset, rendering the epidermis ""leaky,"" thereby increasing the risk of allergen penetration and the succeeding inflammatory reaction that contributes to atopic eczema. Food allergic sensitisation and eczema frequently coexist during the first 2 years of life, and food allergy is more prevalent in infants and children with moderate to severe eczematous inflammation. The majority of food allergic reactions are caused by 8 foods, with milk, egg, and peanut occurring with greatest frequency. The acquisition of food-specific tolerance occurs predominantly with foods in which the epitopes are grouped together in a conformational structure (milk, egg, wheat, soy), whilst it rarely occurs in patients allergic to foods in which the epitopes are arranged in a linear fashion (nuts, seeds, fish). Better tests and novel therapies, such as immunotherapy and oral tolerance induction, are required for the management of food allergy."

"18943192","abstracttext","Members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex are important cereal pathogens worldwide and belong to one of at least nine phylogenetically distinct species. We examined 298 strains of the F. graminearum species complex collected from wheat or barley in Japan to determine the species and trichothecene chemotype. Phylogenetic analyses and species-diagnostic polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLPs) revealed the presence and differential distribution of F. graminearum sensu stricto (s. str.) and F. asiaticum in Japan. F. graminearum s. str. is predominant in the north, especially in the Hokkaido area, while F. asiaticum is predominant in southern regions. In the Tohoku area, these species co-occurred. Trichothecene chemotyping of all strains by multiplex PCR revealed significantly different chemotype compositions of these species. All 50 strains of F. graminearum s. str. were of a 15- or 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol type, while 173 (70%) out of 246 strains of F. asiaticum were of a nivalenol type. The possibility of gene flow between the two species was investigated by use of 15 PCR-RFLP markers developed in this study. However, no obvious hybrids were detected from 98 strains examined, including strains collected from regions where both species co-occur."

"18943488","abstracttext","ABSTRACT The genetic relationships between isolates of Puccinia triticina virulent on wheat with the Lr26 resistance gene were studied. The diversity within and between isolates of P. triticina from Israel, Europe, and the United States was determined by virulence on near-isogenic Thatcher lines and by random amplified polymorphic DNA. According to the molecular markers, isolates that were virulent on Lr26 had diversity levels similar to those of Lr26 nonpathogenic isolates. Distances between subpopulations of isolates virulent and avirulent on Lr26 varied and were unrelated to the Lr26 virulence phenotype. Cluster analysis suggested four groups, three of which were closely associated with the geographical origin of the isolates-Israel, the United States, and Europe. All four groups included both Lr26 virulent and avirulent pathotypes. The results showed that Lr26 virulent rust pathotypes are as genetically dissimilar as the rest of the population. The cluster analysis showed that the rust population in Israel includes at least two different subpopulations, both of which contain Lr26 virulent and Lr26 avirulent isolates."

"18705853","abstracttext","The French wheat variety 'Camp Remy' (CR) possesses a durable, adult plant resistance to yellow rust (YR), caused by the pathogen Puccinia striiformis. Using cDNA-AFLP on different sets of heterogeneous inbred families (HIFs) derived from the cross CR x Récital, we compared gene expression profiles during one seedling and two adult developmental stages following inoculation with P. striiformis. Transcripts differentially expressed in response to YR infection were isolated and cloned. Sequence analysis of the resultant clones revealed several classes of putative genes, including those related to resistance/defence responses, transcription and signal transduction, and primary metabolism. The expression profiles of seven selected genes were obtained using real-time PCR in CR leaves at the same three stages of development. The results confirmed the stage-specific expression of the genes at one or two specific stages in response to P. striiformis infection and demonstrated that CR modifies the expression of some resistance/defence-related genes during its transition from the seedling to adult growth stages. These results provided the first clue to understand the molecular basis of quantitative trait loci for adult plant resistance to YR and connect it with durability."
"17179080","articletitle","Evolutionary conservation of the FLOWERING LOCUS C-mediated vernalization response: evidence from the sugar beet (Beta vulgaris)."
"17179080","abstracttext","In many plant species, exposure to a prolonged period of cold during the winter promotes flowering in the spring, a process termed vernalization. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the vernalization requirement of winter-annual ecotypes is caused by the MADS-box gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), which is a repressor of flowering. During the vernalization process, FLC is downregulated by alteration of its chromatin structure, thereby permitting flowering to occur. In wheat, a vernalization requirement is imposed by a different repressor of flowering, suggesting that some components of the regulatory network controlling the vernalization response differ between monocots and dicots. The extent to which the molecular mechanisms underlying vernalization have been conserved during the diversification of the angiosperms is not well understood. Using phylogenetic analysis, we identified homologs of FLC in species representing the three major eudicot lineages. FLC homologs have not previously been documented outside the plant family Brassicaceae. We show that the sugar beet FLC homolog BvFL1 functions as a repressor of flowering in transgenic Arabidopsis and is downregulated in response to cold in sugar beet. Cold-induced downregulation of an FLC-like floral repressor may be a central feature of the vernalization response in at least half of eudicot species."

"17222141","abstracttext","In many legumes, the nitrogen fixing root nodules produce H2 gas that diffuses into soil. It has been demonstrated that such exposure of soil to H2 can promote plant growth. To assess whether this may be due to H2-oxidizing microorganisms, bacteria were isolated from soil treated with H2 under laboratory conditions and from soils collected adjacent to H2 producing soybean nodules. Nineteen isolates of H2-oxidizing bacteria were obtained and all exhibited a half-saturation coefficient (Ks) for H2 of about 1 ml l(-1). The isolates were identified as Variovorax paradoxus, Flavobacterium johnsoniae and Burkholderia spp. using conventional microbiological tests and 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Seventeen of the isolates enhanced (57-254%) root elongation of spring wheat seedlings. Using an Arabidopsis thaliana bioassay, plant biomass was increased by 11-27% when inoculated by one of four isolates of V. paradoxus or one isolate of Burkholderia that were selected for evaluation. The isolates of V. paradoxus found in both H2-treated soil and in soil adjacent to soybean nodules had the greatest impact on plant growth. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that H2-oxidizing bacteria in soils have plant growth promoting properties."

A phylogenetic tree based on rpoB gene sequences was also constructed. The isolates originated from Brazil could be separated from those from Australia and France, when data from the rpoB-based phylogenetic tree or gyrB-RFLP were considered. These analyses also allowed the separation of all P. graminis strains studied here into four clusters; one group formed by the strains GJK201 and RSA19T, second group formed by the strains MC22.02 and MC04.21, third group formed by the strains TOD61, TOD 221, TOD302, and TOD111, and forth group formed by all strains isolated from plants sown in Cerrado soil, Brazil. As this last group was formed by strains isolated from sorghum and maize sown in the same soil (Cerrado) in Brazil, our results suggest that the diversity of these P. graminis strains is more affected by the soil type than the plant from where they have been isolated."

Macrophages on treatment with ConA and PHA showed significantly enhanced production of NO, which was dose and time dependent. On the other hand macrophages treated with WGA did not produce NO. L-N-monomethyal-l-arginine (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of NOS inhibited the ConA and PHA induced NO production. ConA and PHA treatment of macrophages induced transcription of iNOS gene and the enhanced expression of iNOS protein. Pharmacological inhibitors of PI3 kinase-Wortmannin, tyrosine kinase-Genestein, protein kinase C-H-7 and p42/44-PD98059 inhibited the ConA and PHA induced production of NO and p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB202190 inhibited NO production only in ConA treated macrophage, while Galphai protein inhibitor-PTX and JNK inhibitor-SP600125 inhibited NO production in PHA treated macrophages. Tyrophostin (AG490), an inhibitor of JAK2 and TMB-8, an intracellular calcium immobilizing agent also inhibited the ConA and PHA induced NO production, suggesting the involvement of JAK-STAT pathway and calcium. The data also provides the relative measure and importance of different key signaling molecules in the regulation of NO production by macrophages on activation."

"17076256","abstracttext","Ran, which functions in nucleocytoplasmic transport and mitosis, binds to and is regulated in part by Ran binding protein (RanBP). A RanBP cDNA (TaRanBP1) was isolated from a wheat cDNA library using RT-PCR product as a probe. The predicted amino acid sequence of TaRanBP1 is over 60% identity to AtRanBP1 from Arabidopsis and also with considerable similarity to human and fungi RanBPs. TaRanBP1 gene was expressed ubiquitously in roots, leaves and stems, with a similar abundance in these tissues. Phylogenetic reconstruction of TaRanBP1 with 32 other RanBPs from 26 species of organisms revealed that RanBPs from plants, animals and fungi clustered as the distinct groups, intraspecies isoforms were not developed for RanBPs, contrast with most other ancestral genes. Structural analysis revealed that all RanBPs were highly conserved in the middle region of their amino acid sequence, which included Ran binding domain and the three conserved motifs that have the essential roles in binding with Ran protein and promotion of GTP hydrolysis by the Ran/RanGAP/RanBP complex. However, N-terminus and C-terminus exhibited very low similarity between the different RanBPs. The different structures in N-terminus and C-terminus of RanBPs are likely to direct the Ran into the specific physiological processes and subsequently exhibit the different roles in different organisms."

This semipermeable structure primarily functions in digestion, and protection against invasive microorganisms and mechanical damage. We report the cDNA cloning and transcription profiles of a peritrophin-A like gene (designated MdesPERI-A1) in the Hessian fly Mayetiola destructor. The predicted amino acid sequence of MdesPERI-A1 revealed a putative secretion signal peptide at its amino terminus, similarity to peritrophins from other insects including dipterans, and the presence of two chitin binding domains each containing six cysteine residues. Quantitative expression analysis of MdesPERI-A1 mRNA in different larval tissues revealed the transcript to be predominantly present in the midgut (597.9-fold) compared to other tissues assayed including salivary glands and fat bodies. Spatial expression patterns during development showed a peak expression of MdesPERI-A1 in the feeding second-instars (146-fold) and a decline in expression in the pupal and adult stages. Transcription profiling of MdesPERI-A1 during compatible (larvae on susceptible plants) and incompatible (larvae on resistant plants) interactions with wheat revealed a greater level (1.7-fold) of MdesPERI-A1 transcript in larvae on resistant plants in the initial time point examined. However, MdesPERI-A1 expression declined in larvae on resistant plants at the later time points."

"17360693","abstracttext","Grass weed populations resistant to aryloxyphenoxypropionate (APP) and cyclohexanedione herbicides that inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase; EC 6.4.1.2) represent a major problem for sustainable agriculture. We investigated the molecular basis of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides for nine wild oat (Avena sterilis ssp. ludoviciana Durieu) populations from the northern grain-growing region of Australia. Five amino acid substitutions in plastid ACCase were correlated with herbicide resistance: Ile-1,781-Leu, Trp-1,999-Cys, Trp-2,027-Cys, Ile-2,041-Asn, and Asp-2,078-Gly (numbered according to the Alopecurus myosuroides plastid ACCase). An allele-specific PCR test was designed to determine the prevalence of these five mutations in wild oat populations suspected of harboring ACCase-related resistance with the result that, in most but not all cases, plant resistance was correlated with one (and only one) of the five mutations. We then showed, using a yeast gene-replacement system, that these single-site mutations also confer herbicide resistance to wheat plastid ACCase: Ile-1,781-Leu and Asp-2,078-Gly confer resistance to APPs and cyclohexanediones, Trp-2,027-Cys and Ile-2,041-Asn confer resistance to APPs, and Trp-1,999-Cys confers resistance only to fenoxaprop. These mutations are very likely to confer resistance to any grass weed species under selection imposed by the extensive agricultural use of the herbicides."

"17298367","abstracttext","Insoluble plant polysaccharides and endogenous mucin are important energy sources for human colonic microorganisms. The object of this study was to determine whether or not specific communities colonize these substrates. Using faecal samples from four individuals as inocula for an anaerobic in vitro continuous flow system, the colonization of wheat bran, high amylose starch and porcine gastric mucin was examined. Recovered substrates were extensively washed and the remaining tightly attached bacterial communities were identified using polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16S rRNA gene sequences and fluorescent in situ hybridization. The substrate had a major influence on the species of attached bacteria detected. Sequences retrieved from bran were dominated by clostridial cluster XIVa bacteria, including uncultured relatives of Clostridium hathewayi, Eubacterium rectale and Roseburia species. Bacteroides species were also detected. The most abundant sequences recovered from starch were related to the cultured species Ruminococcus bromii, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium breve and E. rectale. The most commonly recovered sequences from mucin were from Bifidobacterium bifidum and uncultured bacteria related to Ruminococcus lactaris. This study suggests that a specific subset of bacteria is likely to be the primary colonizers of particular insoluble colonic substrates. For a given substrate, however, the primary colonizing species may vary between host individuals."

"17031651","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of small grain cereal crops caused by the necrotrophic pathogen Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum. These fungi produce the trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) and its derivatives, which enhance the disease development during their interactions with host plants. For the self-protection, the trichothecene producer Fusarium species have Tri101 encoding trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase. Although transgenic expression of Tri101 significantly reduced inhibitory action of DON on tobacco plants, there are several conflicting observations regarding the phytotoxicity of 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) to cereal plants; 3-ADON was reported to be highly phytotoxic to wheat at low concentrations. To examine whether cereal plants show sufficient resistance to 3-ADON, we generated transgenic rice plants with stable expression and inheritance of Tri101. While root growth of wild-type rice plants was severely inhibited by DON in the medium, this fungal toxin was not phytotoxic to the transgenic lines that showed trichothecene 3-O-acetylation activity. This is the first report demonstrating the DON acetylase activity and DON-resistant phenotype of cereal plants expressing the fungal gene."

"17331980","abstracttext","We describe a new Type II congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG-II) caused by mutations in the conserved oligomeric Golgi (COG) complex gene, COG8. The patient has severe psychomotor retardation, seizures, failure to thrive and intolerance to wheat and dairy products. Analysis of serum transferrin and total serum N-glycans showed normal addition of one sialic acid, but severe deficiency in subsequent sialylation of mostly normal N-glycans. Patient fibroblasts were deficient in sialylation of both N- and O-glycans, and also showed slower brefeldin A (BFA)-induced disruption of the Golgi matrix, reminiscent of COG7-deficient cells. Patient fibroblasts completely lacked COG8 protein and had reduced levels and/or mislocalization of several other COG proteins. The patient had two COG8 mutations which severely truncated the protein and destabilized the COG complex. The first, IVS3 + 1G > A, altered the conserved splicing site of intron 3, and the second deleted two nucleotides (1687-1688 del TT) in exon 5, truncating the last 47 amino acids. Lentiviral-mediated complementation with normal COG8 corrected mislocalization of other COG proteins, normalized sialylation and restored normal BFA-induced Golgi disruption. We propose to call this new disorder CDG-IIh or CDG-II/COG8."

"17562090","abstracttext","The ubiquitous cell membrane proteins called aquaporins are now firmly established as channel proteins that control the specific transport of water molecules across cell membranes in all living organisms. The aquaporins are thus likely to be of fundamental significance to all facets of plant growth and development affected by plant-water relations. A majority of plant aquaporins have been found to share essential structural features with the human aquaporin and exhibit water-transporting ability in various functional assays, and some have been shown experimentally to be of critical importance to plant survival. Furthermore, substantial evidence is now available from a number of plant species that shows differential gene expression of aquaporins in response to abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought, or cold and clearly establishes the aquaporins as major players in the response of plants to conditions that affect water availability. This review summarizes the function and regulation of these genes to develop a greater understanding of the response of plants to water insufficiency, and particularly, to identify tolerant genotypes of major crop species including wheat and rice and plants that are important in agroforestry."

"17511023","abstracttext","In France, as in many other European countries, Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel) Schröter in Cohn (anamorph Septoria tritici), the causal agent of wheat leaf blotch, is controlled by foliar applications of fungicides. With the recent generalization of resistance to strobilurins (QoIs), reliable control is mainly dependent upon inhibitors of sterol 14 alpha-demethylation (DMIs). To date, strains with reduced sensitivity to DMIs are widespread, but disease control using members of this class of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors has not been compromised. In this study, sensitivity assays based on in vitro effects of fungicides towards germ-tube elongation allowed the characterization of seven DMI-resistant phenotypes. In four of them, cross-resistance was not observed between all tested DMIs; this characteristic concerned prochloraz, triflumizole, fluquinconazole and tebuconazole. Moreover, the highest resistant factors to most DMIs were found only in recent isolates; according to their response towards prochloraz, they were classified into two categories. Molecular studies showed that DMI resistance was associated with mutations in the CYP51 gene encoding the sterol 14 alpha-demethylase. Alterations at codons 459, 460 and 461 were related to low resistance levels, whereas, at position 381, a valine instead of an isoleucine, in combination with the previous changes, determined the highest resistance levels to all DMIs except prochloraz. Mutations in codons 316 and 317 were also found in some isolates exhibiting low resistance factors towards most DMIs."

In this study, heterosis was estimated for eight root traits in 20 wheat hybrids derived from a NC Design II mating scheme. Positive mid-parent heterosis was detected in 96 of 160 hybrid-trait combinations, and positive high-parent heterosis was detected in 79 of 160 hybrid-trait combinations. Improved differential display was used to analyze alterations in gene expression between hybrids and their parents in roots at the jointing stage. More than 990 fragments were repeatedly displayed, among which 27.52% were differentially expressed between hybrids and their parents. Four differential expression patterns were observed. Thirty differentially expressed cDNA fragments and three genes with open reading frames were cloned, and their expression patterns were confirmed by reverse-northern blot and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis, respectively. We concluded that these differentially expressed genes, though mostly with unknown function, could play important roles for hybrids to demonstrate heterosis in root system traits."

"17852353","abstracttext","The 14-3-3 proteins, originally described as the mammalian brain proteins, are ubiquitous eukaryotic proteins and have been shown to exert an array of function. A great number of 14-3-3 sequences have been reported in Eudicotyledon. The data of 14-3-3 from the monocotyledon plants, however, are limited. In this report, a 14-3-3 cDNA (designated as Ta14A) was isolated from wheat. An extensive search in GenBank database revealed another 14 14-3-3 isoforms from monocotyledonous plants. These proteins plus 14-3-3 isoforms from Arabidopsis were used for phylogenetic reconstruction, which revealed two groups of 14-3-3 proteins in monocotyledonous plants, namely epsilon and non-epsilon, respectively. The epsilon isoforms were present in monocotyledonous plants. Therefore, the gene duplication to result in an epsilon and non-epsilon isoforms was likely to take place before the speciation of monocotyledon and Eudicotyledon plants. Structural analysis indicated that the different conserved domains and structural characters existed in the monocotyledon 14-3-3 isoforms, which will affect their interaction with other effector proteins. Ta14A was strongly expressed in leaf and stem, undetected in root, suggesting it may have the unique functions within these tissues. These data suggest that structure difference and spatial expression of 14-3-3 will be the important factors to confine its functional specificity."

Of the 299 isolates assayed, 231 are from F. asiaticum species lineage 6, which produce deoxynivalenol and 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-AcDON); deoxynivalenol and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-AcDON); and nivalenol and 4-acetylnivalenol (NIV) mycotoxins, with 3-AcDON being the predominant chemotype. Ninety-five percent of this species originated from the warmer regions where the annual average temperatures were above 15 degrees C, based on the climate data of 30 y during 1970-1999. However, 68 isolates within F. graminearum species lineage 7 consisted only of 15-AcDON producers, 59% of which were from the cooler regions where the annual average temperatures were 15 degrees C or lower. Identification of a new subpopulation of 15-AcDON producers revealed a molecular distinction between F. graminearum and F. asiaticum that produce 15-AcDON. An 11-bp repeat is present in F. graminearum within their Tri7 gene sequences but is absent in F. asiaticum, which could be directly used for differentiating the two phylogenetic species of the F. graminearum clade."

"16717423","abstracttext","The complete nucleotide sequences of the cDNA and its gene that encode a bifunctional alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitor of rice (Oryza sativa L.) (RASI) were analyzed. RASI cDNA (939 bp) encoded a 200-residue polypeptide with a molecular mass of 21,417 Da, including a signal peptide of 22 amino acids. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that RASI is closely related to alpha-amylase/subtilisin inhibitors from barley and wheat. RASI was found to be expressed only in seeds, suggesting that it has a seed-specific function. A coding region of RASI cDNA without the signal peptide was introduced into Escherichia coli and was expressed as a His-tagged protein. Recombinant RASI was purified to homogeneity in a single step by Ni-chelating affinity column chromatography and characterized to elucidate the target enzyme. The recombinant inhibitor had strong inhibitory activity toward subtilisin, with an equimolar relationship, comparable with that of native RASI, and weak inhibitory activity toward some microbial alpha-amylases, but not toward animal or insect alpha-amylases. These results suggest that RASI might function in the defense of the seed against microorganisms."

The microbial composition of the traditional sourdoughs was characterized by bacteriological culture in combination with genotypic identification methods, including repetitive element sequence-based PCR fingerprinting and phenylalanyl-tRNA synthase (pheS) gene sequence analysis. LAB from Belgian sourdoughs belonged to the genera Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, Leuconostoc, Weissella, and Enterococcus, with the heterofermentative species Lactobacillus paralimentarius, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus plantarum, and Lactobacillus pontis as the most frequently isolated taxa. Statistical analysis of the identification data indicated that the microbial composition of the sourdoughs is mainly affected by the bakery environment rather than the flour type (wheat, rye, spelt, or a mixture of these) used. In conclusion, the polyphasic approach, based on rapid genotypic screening and high-resolution, sequence-dependent identification, proved to be a powerful tool for studying the LAB diversity in traditional fermented foods such as sourdough."

"17918623","abstracttext","Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are known to play pivotal roles in intracellular signaling during abiotic and biotic stress responses. To unravel potential functions of CDPKs in the course of barley (Hordeum vulgare)-powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) interactions, we systematically analyzed the HvCDPK gene family. We found that, according to the existence of respective expressed sequence tags, at least nine paralogs are expressed in the barley leaf epidermis, the sole target tissue of powdery mildew fungi. We exemplarily selected two HvCDPKs with known full-length coding sequence for functional analysis. Transient expression of a putative constitutive active variant of one of these (HvCDPK4) in Nicotiana benthamiana triggered kinase-dependent mesophyll cell death in tobacco leaves. In a barley mlo mutant genotype, a constitutive active variant of the second paralog, HvCDPK3, partially compromised the highly effective resistance to B. graminis f. sp. hordei. A similar break of mlo resistance was seen upon expression of the junction domain of HvCDPK4, supposed to act as a dominant inhibitor of CDPK activity. Expression of a constitutive active HvCDPK3 or HvCDPK4 form also compromised penetration resistance to the inappropriate wheat powdery mildew fungus. Collectively, our data provide evidence for antagonistic roles of individual CDPK paralogs in the control of host cell entry during the early phase of powdery mildew pathogenesis."

"17908205","abstracttext","Antifungal defensins, MsDef1 and MtDef4, from Medicago spp., inhibit the growth of a fungal pathogen, Fusarium graminearum, at micromolar concentrations. However, molecular mechanisms by which they inhibit the growth of this fungus are not known. We have characterized a functional role of the fungal sphingolipid glucosylceramide in regulating sensitivity of the fungus to MsDef1 and MtDef4. A null mutation of the FgGCS1 gene encoding glucosylceramide synthase results in a mutant lacking glucosylceramide. The DeltaFggcs1-null mutant becomes resistant to MsDef1, but not to MtDef4. It shows a significant change in the conidial morphology and displays dramatic polar growth defect, and its mycelia are resistant to cell wall degrading enzymes. Contrary to its essential role in the pathogenicity of a human fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, GCS1 is not required for the pathogenicity of F. graminearum. The DeltaFggcs1 mutant successfully colonizes wheat heads and corn silk, but its ability to spread in these tissues is significantly reduced as compared with the wild-type PH-1 strain. In contrast, it retains full virulence on tomato fruits and Arabidopsis thaliana floral and foliar tissues. Based on our findings, we conclude that glucosylceramide is essential for MsDef1-mediated growth inhibition of F. graminearum, but its role in fungal pathogenesis is host-dependent."

"17897184","abstracttext_methods and results","Genotypic identification was carried out by partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Genetic diversity was evaluated by RAPD-PCR analysis. Phenotypic diversity was evaluated through fermentative profile by Biolog system, proteinase and peptidase activities using synthetic substrates, and acidification capacity and amino acid profile during sourdough fermentation. The genetic analyses excluded clonal relatedness among the strains used. A large phenotypic diversity was found. It mainly concerned the capacity to use carbon sources available in sourdough during fermentation, the quotient of fermentation and the peptidase activities, especially towards proline containing synthetic substrates. The free amino acid profiles differed either for the total concentration or for the type of amino acids. With a few exceptions, proteinase activity towards wheat albumins and globulins was weak."
"17897184","abstracttext_conclusions","Overall, no relationships between genetic and physiological analyses were found, and the strains examined showed a marked genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity.

"16666982","abstracttext","Cereal lectins are a class of biochemically and antigenically related proteins localized in a tissue-specific manner in embryos and adult plants. To study the specificity of lectin expression, a barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) embryo cDNA library was constructed and a clone (BLc3) for barley lectin was isolated. BLc3 is 972 nucleotides long and includes an open reading frame of 212 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence contains a putative signal peptide of 26 amino acid residues followed by a 186 amino acid polypeptide. This polypeptide has 95% sequence identity to the antigenically indistinguishable wheat germ agglutinin isolectin-B (WGA-B) suggesting that BLc3 encodes barley lectin. Further evidence that BLc3 encodes barley lectin was obtained by immunoprecipitation of the in vitro translation products of BLc3 RNA transcripts and barley embryo poly(A(+)) RNA. In situ hybridizations with BLc3 showed that barley lectin gene expression is confined to the outermost cell layers of both embryonic and adult root tips. On Northern blots, BLc3 hybridizes to a 1.0 kilobyte mRNA in poly(A(+)) RNA from both embryos and root tips. We suggest, on the basis of immunoblot experiments, that barley lectin is synthesized as a glycosylated precursor and processed by removal of a portion of the carboxyl terminus including the single N-linked glycosylation site."

"16667144","abstracttext","To study long-lived mRNAs stored in radish (Raphanus sativus) seed, we have selected clones from a dry seed cDNA library by differential screening. One of these clones, p8B6, whose mRNAs are abundant in the dry seed, was characterized. This clone hybridizes to an RNA class of approximately 600 nucleotides whose accumulation begins during the desiccation phase, reaches its maximum level in the dry seed, and is no longer detectable in 12 hour old seedlings. mRNAs hybrid-selected by p8B6 encode four polypeptides, but only two are compatible with the size class of RNAs detected by Northern analysis. Three of them have previously been identified as major ;early germination' polypeptides, and their synthesis has been shown to be induced prematurely in immature embryos by a desiccation treatment. The protein deduced from the p8B6 nucleotide sequence is 9 kilodaltons in size, highly hydrophilic, rich in Gly and Glu, and contains no Cys, Trp, and lie. The amino acid sequence shares good homology with that of two recently described seed proteins: a cotton late embryogenesis abundant protein and the wheat early methionine-labeled protein. Southern blot analysis suggests that the p8B6 sequence belongs to a very small gene family. The exact function of the product encoded by p8B6 remains to be determined."

"16668189","abstracttext","We have examined the occurrence/disappearance, tissue location, and posttranslational modification of beta-amylase proteins in rye (Secale cereale L.) kernels at three physiological stages (development, maturity, germination) with a normal inbred line and a mutant line exhibiting a high but incomplete beta-amylase deficiency. This deficiency corresponds to a lack of accumulation of beta-amylase activity in the endosperm and does not affect the level of activity in the outer pericarp and green tissues as compared to the normal line. Two antigenically related but distinct beta-amylases (I and II) were detected in the normal line (II being the major constituent) and only one (I) in the mutant line. I and II display very similar electrophoretic polymorphism. In both lines, I appears to be ubiquitous, although it disappears from the outer pericarp during ripening. Antigen II was present only in the normal line and appears to be specific for the endosperm and perhaps for the maternal green tissues of the seed. Posttranslational modifications occurring during germination, which are mimicked by the action of papain, affect II but not I. The two groups of beta-amylases are discussed in relation to recent reports indicating the presence of two types of beta-amylase with different functions and gene loci in barley and wheat."

"18796335","abstracttext","A non-targeted metabolomics approach was used to identify significant changes in metabolism upon exposure of the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum to 0.5M NaCl. The polyol arabitol, and to a lesser extent glycerol, was found to accumulate in response to the osmotic stress treatment. Amino acid synthesis was strongly down-regulated whilst mannitol levels were unaffected. A reverse genetic approach was undertaken to dissect the role of arabitol metabolism during salt stress. Strains of S. nodorum lacking a gene encoding an l-arabitol dehydrogenase (abd1), a xylitol dehydrogenase (xdh1) and a double-mutant lacking both genes (abd1xdh1) were exposed to salt and the intracellular metabolites analysed. Arabitol levels were significantly up-regulated upon salt stress in the xdh1 strains but were significantly lower than the wild-type. Arabitol was not significantly different in either the abd1 or the abd1xdh1 strains during osmotic stress but the concentration of glycerol was significantly higher indicating a compensatory mechanism in operation. Genome sequence analysis identified a second possible enzyme capable of synthesizing arabitol explaining the basal level of arabitol present in the abd1xdh1 strains. This study identified that arabitol is the primary compatible solute in S. nodorum but in-built levels of redundancy are present allowing the fungus to tolerate osmotic stress."

"18757530","abstracttext","Caulobacter crescentus cells adhere to surfaces by using an extremely strong polar adhesin called the holdfast. The polysaccharide component of the holdfast is comprised in part of oligomers of N-acetylglucosamine. The genes involved in the export of the holdfast polysaccharide and the anchoring of the holdfast to the cell were previously discovered. In this study, we identified a cluster of polysaccharide biosynthesis genes (hfsEFGH) directly adjacent to the holdfast polysaccharide export genes. Sequence analysis indicated that these genes are involved in the biosynthesis of the minimum repeat unit of the holdfast polysaccharide. HfsE is predicted to be a UDP-sugar lipid-carrier transferase, the glycosyltransferase that catalyzes the first step in polysaccharide biosynthesis. HfsF is predicted to be a flippase, HfsG is a glycosyltransferase, and HfsH is similar to a polysaccharide (chitin) deacetylase. In-frame hfsG and hfsH deletion mutants resulted in severe deficiencies both in surface adhesion and in binding to the holdfast-specific lectin wheat germ agglutinin. In contrast, hfsE and hfsF mutants exhibited nearly wild-type levels of adhesion and holdfast synthesis. We identified three paralogs to hfsE, two of which are redundant to hfsE for holdfast synthesis. We also identified a redundant paralog to the hfsC gene, encoding the putative polysaccharide polymerase, and present evidence that the hfsE and hfsC paralogs, together with the hfs genes, are absolutely required for proper holdfast synthesis."

"18723516","abstracttext","The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel is a membrane-integral protein that belongs to an ATP-binding cassette superfamily. Mutations in the CFTR gene cause cystic fibrosis in which salt, water, and protein transports are defective in various tissues. Here we expressed wild-type human CFTR as a FLAG-fused protein in HEK293 cells heterologously and purified it in three steps: anti-FLAG and wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatographies and size exclusion chromatography. The stoichiometry of the protein was analyzed using various biochemical approaches, including chemical cross-linking, blue-native PAGE, size exclusion chromatography, and electron microscopy (EM) observation of antibody-decorated CFTR. All these data support a dimeric assembly of CFTR. Using 5,039 automatically selected particles from negatively stained EM images, the three-dimensional structure of CFTR was reconstructed at 2-nm resolution assuming a 2-fold symmetry. CFTR, presumably in a closed state, was shown to be an ellipsoidal particle with dimensions of 120 x 106 x 162 A. It comprises a small dome-shaped extracellular and membrane-spanning domain and a large cytoplasmic domain with orifices beneath the putative transmembrane domain. EM observation of CFTR.anti-regulatory domain antibody complex confirmed that two regulatory domains are located around the bottom end of the larger oval cytoplasmic domain."

"18727555","abstracttext","Lunasin is a novel cancer preventive peptide whose efficacy against chemical carcinogens and oncogenes has been demonstrated in mammalian cells and a skin cancer mouse model. In contrast, constitutive expression of the lunasin gene in mammalian cells leads to arrest of cell division and cell death. Isolated and characterized in soy, lunasin peptide is also documented in barley and wheat and is predicted to be present in many more seeds because of its possible role in seed development. Initial studies show that lunasin is bioavailable in mice when orally ingested. Lunasin internalizes into mammalian cells within minutes of exogenous application, and localizes in the nucleus after 18 h. It inhibits acetylation of core histones in mammalian cells but does not affect the growth rate of normal and established cancer cell lines. An epigenetic mechanism of action is proposed whereby lunasin selectively kills cells being transformed or newly transformed cells by binding to deacetylated core histones exposed by the transformation event, disrupting the dynamics of histone acetylation-deacetylation."

"18704186","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum Schwabe (teleomorph Gibberella zeae) is a plant pathogen causing scab disease on wheat and barley that reduces crop yield and grain quality. F. graminearum also causes stalk and ear rots of maize and is a producer of mycotoxins such as the trichothecenes that contaminate grain and are harmful to humans and livestock (Goswami and Kistler, 2004). The fungus produces two types of spores. Ascospores, the propagules resulting from sexual reproduction, are the main source of primary infection. These spores are forcibly discharged from mature perithecia and dispersed by wind (Francl et al 1999). Secondary infections are mainly caused by macroconidia which are produced by asexual means on the plant surface. To study the developmental processes of ascospores in this fungus, a procedure for their collection in large quantity under sterile conditions was required. Our protocol was filmed in order to generate the highest level of information for understanding and reproducibility; crucial aspects when full genome gene expression profiles are generated and interpreted. In particular, the variability of ascospore germination and biological activity are dependent on the prior manipulation of the material. The use of video for documenting every step in ascospore production is proposed in order to increase standardization, complying with the increasingly stringent requirements for microarray analysis. The procedure requires only standard laboratory equipment. Steps are shown to prevent contamination and favor time synchronization of ascospores."

Tryptic peptide comparisons of vp2 and vp4 revealed unique amino acid sequences for each product indicating that vp2 was not a read through protein of vp4. The in vitro translation products were synthesized in the order of their molecular weight, with vp4 appearing first. Therefore, vp4 and vp2 were not produced from a slowly processed precursor. RNA 2 (Mr 1.2 x 106) was shown to code for one product, vp3 (Mr 45,000). Northern analysis of total virion RNA, which was hybridized to cDNA transcribed from total virion RNA, did not detect additional RNA species. Therefore, gene products, vp2, vp3, and vp4, appear to be translated from the two genomic RNAs rather than from encapsidated subgenomic RNAs. PEMV antiserum specifically immunoprecipitated vp2, indicating that vp2 has amino acid sequences that are related to those of capsid protein."

A comparative analysis has been carried out to determine the relationship of the finger millet genome with that of rice. Six of the nine finger millet homoeologous groups corresponded to a single rice chromosome each. Each of the remaining three finger millet groups were orthologous to two rice chromosomes, and in all the three cases one rice chromosome was inserted into the centromeric region of a second rice chromosome to give the finger millet chromosomal configuration. All observed rearrangements were, among the grasses, unique to finger millet and, possibly, the Chloridoideae subfamily. Gene orders between rice and finger millet were highly conserved, with rearrangements being limited largely to single marker transpositions and small putative inversions encompassing at most three markers. Only some 10% of markers mapped to non-syntenic positions in rice and finger millet and the majority of these were located in the distal 14% of chromosome arms, supporting a possible correlation between recombination and sequence evolution as has previously been observed in wheat. A comparison of the organization of finger millet, Panicoideae and Pooideae genomes relative to rice allowed us to infer putative ancestral chromosome configurations in the grasses."

The BW, however, was similar for yellow and wild-type males at 35 d, and it remained so throughout the last part of the growth of the quail monitored until the age of 120 d, as indicated by the very close parameters of the monomolecular growth curve [BW= A - B exp(-kt)] obtained for the 2 groups. Yellow plumage color was also associated with a more difficult adaptation to housing (measured by temporary BW loss) in individual cages and to a significantly 0.2 degrees C lower body temperature at 42 d, but feed consumption and residual feed intake were similar for the 2 plumage color phenotypes. Breast and liver weights were similar in the 2 groups, but abdominal fat was 24% higher (4.66 vs. 3.76 g) in yellow quail. There is some association between the correlated effects of the Y gene in quail and those of the lethal mutation A(y) at the agouti locus in the mouse."

"17603095","abstracttext","Publication of the rice genome sequence has allowed an in-depth analysis of genome organization in a model monocot plant species. This has provided a powerful tool for genome analysis in large-genome unsequenced agriculturally important monocot species such as wheat, barley, rye, Lolium, etc. Previous data have indicated that the majority of genes in large-genome monocots are located toward the ends of chromosomes in gene-rich regions that undergo high frequencies of recombination. Here we demonstrate that a substantial component of the coding sequences in monocots is localized proximally in regions of very low and even negligible recombination frequencies. The implications of our findings are that during domestication of monocot plant species selection has concentrated on genes located in the terminal regions of chromosomes within areas of high recombination frequency. Thus a large proportion of the genetic variation available for selection of superior plant genotypes has not been exploited. In addition our findings raise the possibility of the evolutionary development of large supergene complexes that confer a selective advantage to the individual."

Here, we describe a new feature, a granular area, potentially involved in particle capture and feeding. The binding of the lectin wheat germ agglutinin to the granular area of cells with discharged ejectisomes indicates the adhesive nature of this novel feature. The presence of a microtubular intracellular cytopharynx, apparently also used for feeding, has been revealed by LSCM. The small subunit rRNA gene of the isolate has been sequenced (1,788 bp). Phylogenetic results corroborate significant genetic divergence within the marine members of Goniomonas.

The recombinant ARN2 catalyzed internal cleavage of alpha-1,5 glycosidic bonds of CM-arabinan, debranched arabinan, linear arabinan, and sugar beet (native) arabinan at rates of decreasing order, and was inactive on wheat arabinoxylan and p-nitrophenyl-alpha-L-arabinofuranoside. Kinetic analysis showed that branching in the arabinan did not significantly affect the apparent K(m) values, and the difference in the reaction rates was likely due to the chemical step after substrate binding. The enzyme hydrolyzed arabino-oligosaccharides of DP> or =6 to smaller oligomers and mostly arabinotriose. Natural and modified arabinans were cleaved to oligomers of various chain lengths, which were progressively hydrolyzed to yield arabinotriose. The pattern of degradation revealed an endo-acting mechanism with arabinotriose as the end product."

Here, wheat seeds were inoculated with the wild-type strain Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 or one of three genetically modified (GM) derivatives and grown for one month. The GM derivatives contained a plasmid vector harboring the indole-3-pyruvate/phenylpyruvate decarboxylase gene ipdC (IAA production) controlled either by the constitutive promoter PnptII or the root exudate-responsive promoter PsbpA, or by an empty vector (GM control). All inoculants displayed equal rhizosphere population densities. Only inoculation with either ipdC construct increased shoot biomass compared with the non-inoculated control. At one month after inoculation, automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) revealed that the effect of the PsbpA construct on bacterial community structure differed from that of the GM control, which was confirmed by 16S rDNA-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The fungal community was sensitive to inoculation with the PsbpA construct and especially the GM control, based on ARISA data. Overall, fungal and bacterial communities displayed distinct responses to inoculation of GM A. brasilense phytostimulators, whose effects could differ from those of the wild-type."

"20629701","abstracttext","The contribution of chemotaxis to the competitive colonization of the rhizosphere for the vast majority of the soil community is unknown. We have developed and applied a molecular diagnostic tool, based on a gene encoding the central regulator of bacterial chemotaxis (cheA), to characterize and temporally track specific populations of native microbes with chemotaxis potential that are present in soil exposed to two rhizospheres: wheat and cowpea. The data show that the chemotactic-competent communities present in the rhizospheres of the two plants are distinct and less diverse than the bulk soil, indicating the development of unique microbial communities. Consistent with the supposition that selection and recruitment of specific soil microbes takes place in the rhizosphere, the dynamics of specific cheA phylotypes provides support for the hypothesis that chemotaxis provides a competitive advantage to some soil microbes. This is the first study to examine and profile the genetic diversity of chemotaxis genes in natural populations. As such, it illustrates our limited understanding of microbial chemotaxis for the majority of soil microbes. It also highlights the value of a culture-independent approach for examining chemotaxis populations in order to build empirical lines of evidence for its role in structuring of microbial assemblages."

The lunasin gene was synthesized by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction and expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) with the use of vector pET29a. The recombinant lunasin containing his-tag at the C-terminus was expressed in soluble form which could be purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography. After 4 h, the expression level is above 4.73 mg of recombinant his-tagged lunasin/L of Luria-Bertani broth. It does not affect the bacterial growth and expression levels. This is the first study that successfully uses E. coli as a host to produce valuable bioactive lunasin. The result of in vitro bioassay showed that the purified recombinant lunasin can inhibit histone acetylation. Recombinant lunasin also inhibits the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and nitric oxide production). Compared with other research methods on extraction or chemical synthesis to produce lunasin, our method is very efficient in saving time and cost. In the future, it could be applied in medicine and structure-function determination."

"20352206","abstracttext","The effect of the location of wheat residues (soil surface vs. incorporated in soil) on their decomposition and on soil bacterial communities was investigated by the means of a field experiment. Bacterial-automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis of DNA extracts from residues, detritusphere (soil adjacent to residues), and bulk soil evidenced that residues constitute the zone of maximal changes in bacterial composition. However, the location of the residues influenced greatly their decomposition and the dynamics of the colonizing bacterial communities. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene in DNA extracts from the residues at the early, middle, and late stages of degradation confirmed the difference of composition of the bacterial community according to the location. Bacteria belonging to the γ-subgroup of proteobacteria were stimulated when residues were incorporated whereas the α-subgroup was stimulated when residues were left at the soil surface. Moreover, Actinobacteria were more represented when residues were left at the soil surface. According to the ecological attributes of the populations identified, our results suggested that climatic fluctuations at the soil surface select populations harboring enhanced catabolic and/or survival capacities whereas residues characteristics likely constitute the main determinant of the composition of the bacterial community colonizing incorporated residues."

In order to assess further the expression diversity of the TaLTP genes, we have attempted to evaluate their expression profiles in responses to abiotic stresses, using semi-quantitative RT-PCR. The expression profiles generated herein revealed that the TaLTP genes in group A evidenced highly similar responses against abiotic stresses, whereas differential expression patterns among genes in each group were also observed. A total of seven promoters were fused to a GUS reporter gene and the recombinants were introduced into Arabidopsis, while three promoters evidenced non-detectible GUS activity. The promoters of TaLTP1, TaLTP7, and TaLTP10 included in group A drove strong expressions during plant development with overlapping patterns, in large part, but also exhibited distinct expression pattern, thereby suggesting subfunctionalization processing over evolutionary time. However, only trace expression in cotyledons, young emerged leaves, and epidermal cell layers of flower ovaries was driven by the promoter of TaLTP3 of group B. These results indicate that their distinct physiological functions appear to be accomplished by a subfunctionalization process involving degenerative mutations in regulatory regions."

However, the role of PMEI in many plant species still remains to be elucidated, especially in wheat. To facilitate the expression analysis of the TaPMEI gene, RT-PCR was performed using leaf, stem and root tissues that were treated with exogeneous application of phytohormones and abiotic stresses. High transcription was detected in salicylic acid (SA) and hydrogen peroxide treatments. To elucidate the subcellular localization of the TaPMEI protein, the TaPMEI:GFP fusion construct was transformed into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. The fluorescence signal was exclusively detected in the cell wall. Using an enzyme assay, we confirmed that PME was completely inhibited by TaPMEI. These results indicated that TaPMEI was involved in inhibition of pectin methylesterification and may play a role in the plant defense mechanism via cell wall fortification."

"19717446","abstracttext","Single-nucleotide polymorphism was used in the construction of an expressed sequence tag map of Aegilops tauschii, the diploid source of the wheat D genome. Comparisons of the map with the rice and sorghum genome sequences revealed 50 inversions and translocations; 2, 8, and 40 were assigned respectively to the rice, sorghum, and Ae. tauschii lineages, showing greatly accelerated genome evolution in the large Triticeae genomes. The reduction of the basic chromosome number from 12 to 7 in the Triticeae has taken place by a process during which an entire chromosome is inserted by its telomeres into a break in the centromeric region of another chromosome. The original centromere-telomere polarity of the chromosome arms is maintained in the new chromosome. An intrachromosomal telomere-telomere fusion resulting in a pericentric translocation of a chromosome segment or an entire arm accompanied or preceded the chromosome insertion in some instances. Insertional dysploidy has been recorded in three grass subfamilies and appears to be the dominant mechanism of basic chromosome number reduction in grasses. A total of 64% and 66% of Ae. tauschii genes were syntenic with sorghum and rice genes, respectively. Synteny was reduced in the vicinity of the termini of modern Ae. tauschii chromosomes but not in the vicinity of the ancient termini embedded in the Ae. tauschii chromosomes, suggesting that the dependence of synteny erosion on gene location along the centromere-telomere axis either evolved recently in the Triticeae phylogenetic lineage or its evolution was recently accelerated."

"19814777","abstracttext","The genetic basis of nonhost resistance of barley to nonadapted formae speciales of Blumeria graminis is not known, as there is no barley line that is susceptible to these nonadapted formae speciales, such as the wheat powdery mildew pathogen, Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt). Barley accessions with rudimentary susceptibility to an isolate of the nonadapted Bgt were identified. Those accessions were intercrossed in two cycles and two lines, called SusBgt(SC) and SusBgt(DC), with substantial susceptibility to Bgt at the seedling stage were selected. The quantitative variation among barley accessions and in the progenies after convergent crossing suggests a polygenic basis for this nonhost resistance. Both lines allowed an unusually high level of haustorium formation and colony development by Bgt. The SusBgt lines and their ancestor lines also allowed haustorium formation and conidiation by four out of seven isolates of other nonadapted B. graminis forms. Analysis of the infection process suggested that nonhost resistance factors are specific to the form and developmental stage of B. graminis. Resistances to establishment (first haustorium), colonization (subsequent haustoria) and conidiation are not associated. The lines developed will be of use in elucidating the genetic basis of nonhost resistance to Bgt in barley, and in gene expression and complementation studies on nonhost resistance."

"19782953","abstracttext","A polyploid organism by possessing more than two sets of chromosomes from one species (autopolyploidy) or two or more species (allopolyploidy) is known to have evolutionary advantages. However, by what means a polyploid accommodates increased genetic dosage or divergent genomes (allopolyploidy) in one cell nucleus and cytoplasm constitutes an enormous challenge. Recent years have witnessed efforts and progress in exploring the possible mechanisms by which these seemingly intangible hurdles of polyploidy may be ameliorated or eventually overcome. In particular, the documentation of rapid and extensive non-Mendelian genetic and epigenetic changes that often accompany nascent polyploidy is revealing: the resulting non-additive and novel gene expression at global, regional and local levels, and timely restoration of meiotic chromosomal behavior towards bivalent pairing and disomic inheritance may ensure rapid establishment and stabilization as well as its long-term evolutionary success. Further elucidation on these novel mechanisms underpinning polyploidy will promote our understanding on fundamental issues in evolutionary biology and in our manipulation capacities in future genetic improvement of important crops that are currently polyploids in genomic constitution. This review is intended to provide an updated discussion on these interesting and important issues within the scope of a specific yet one of the most important plant groups-polyploid wheat and its related species."
"19710517","articletitle","Autoimmunity and diet."
"19710517","abstracttext","Whether diet may influence autoimmunity has been the subject of many unsolved debates. Interestingly, growing evidence indicates a large overlap between the mechanisms controlling tolerance to dietary antigens and autoimmunity. To discuss these links, we will focus on two model human diseases. The first one is IPEX syndrome due to mutations in the X-linked foxp3 gene. Studies of this disease underscore the role of regulatory FOXP3+ T cells in controlling the reactivity against self antigens and the response to dietary proteins in humans. The second is celiac disease, a complex poly-genic disease where exposure to dietary wheat proteins can trigger an autoimmune-like attack of the intestine frequently associated with the onset of extra-digestive autoimmune disorders. In the later disease, recent work shed light on the mechanisms that drive the intestinal inflammatory response to gluten and suggests impairment of immunoregulatory mechanisms that control intestinal tolerance and autoimmunity. Yet the exact role of gluten in the pathogenesis of extra-intestinal autoimmunity has not been elucidated. Interestingly, recent work indicates that dietary factors, including vitamin A and breast milk feeding, can protect against the development of harmful responses to dietary proteins. It is unclear whether this protection can apply to the prevention of autoimmunity."

The results revealed that 24 rhizobacterial isolates were tolerant at 8% NaCl. Although all the 24 salt tolerable isolates produced indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), while 10 isolates solubilized phosphorus, eight produced siderophore, and six produced gibberellin. However, only three isolates showed the production of 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. Diversity was analyzed through 16S rDNA-RFLP, and of these isolates with three tetra cutter restriction enzymes (HaeIII, AluI, and MspI), the representative cluster groups were identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. Bacillus and Bacillus-derived genera were dominant which showed PGP attributes at 8% NaCl concentration. Out of 24 isolates, nitrogen fixing ability (nif H gene) was detected in the two isolates, SU18 (Arthrobacter sp.) and SU48."

TRPM8-immunoreactivity was detected in a small proportion of the WGA-HRP-labeled bladder afferent neurons in the dorsal root ganglia of the Th13-L1 (1.14%) and the L6-S1 (1.27%), and these neurons were small in size (<600 microm(2)). The 82.6+/-3.8% of the TRPM8-immunoreactive bladder afferent neurons and 80.9+/-1.5% of the total population of the TRPM8-immunoreactive afferent neurons in the observed dorsal root ganglia expressed NF200. On the other hand, the proportions of the co-expression of TRPM8 and nociceptive markers such as calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), transient receptor potential vanilloid-1 (TRPV1), and isolectin B4 (IB4) in the bladder afferent neurons (81.5+/-5.2% for CGRP, 36.1+/-4.0% for TRPV1, and 15.8+/-5.5% for IB4) were higher in comparison to those in the total population of the TRPM8-immunoreactive afferent neurons (21.9+/-2.4% for CGRP, 16.6+/-1.7% for TRPV1, and 5.4+/-0.5% for IB4), although no significant difference existed for IB4. Our results suggest that the TRPM8-expressing bladder afferents should be classified as Adelta-fibers and C-fibers, while some of these afferents may be involved in nociceptive sensations."

"19646247","abstracttext_background","Deproteinized DNA from eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells still contains a low-molecular weight peptidic fraction which can be dissociated by alkalinization of the medium. This fraction inhibits RNA transcription and tumor cell growth. Removal from DNA of normal cells causes amplification of DNA template activity. This effect is lower or absent in several cancer cell lines. Likewise, the amount of active peptides in cancer cell DNA extracts is lower than in DNA preparation of the corresponding normal cells. Such evidence, and their ubiquitous presence, suggests that they are a regulatory, conserved factor involved in the control of normal cell growth and gene expression."

"19838400","abstracttext","Translation of viral proteins from subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) is a common strategy among positive-stranded RNA viruses. Unlike host mRNA, sgRNA of Potato leafroll virus (PLRV) does not possess a cap at its 5' end nor a poly(A) tail at the 3' terminus, both of which are known to be crucial for translation of RNA in eukaryotic cells. Here, we demonstrate, that in wheat germ extract (WGE) truncation of the sgRNA1 5' UTR increases translation efficiency, as it has previously been observed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (RRL), whereas removal of the 3' UTR does not affect translation. We also describe two regulatory elements located within the coding sequence of the coat protein (CP) gene and its read-through domain (RTD) and are responsible for regulation of in vitro translation of the PLRV sgRNA1. The frst element is composed of the purine sequence AAAGGAAA located between the AUG codons of the CP and 17K genes. Deletion of this domain or its substitution by pyrimidines reduced by half the translation of both genes, whereas deletion of the RTD resulted in a 3.6-fold reduction in translation efficiency. This is the first report of translation regulatory elements of plant viruses located within a coding region."

"21830952","abstracttext","Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factors are unique to fungi and have been reported to be involved in different regulatory functions. Here, we characterized EBR1 (enhanced branching 1), a novel Zn(2)Cys(6) transcription factor of Fusarium graminearum. Knocking out EBR1 in F. graminearum PH-1 caused reduction of both radial growth and virulence. The conidia of knock-out strain PH-1?ebr1 germinated faster than those of wild-type PH-1, but the conidiation of the mutant was significantly reduced. Detailed analysis showed that the reduced radial growth might be due to reduced apical dominance of the hyphal tip, leading to increased hyphal branching. Inoculation assays on wheat heads with a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled PH-1?ebr1 mutant showed that it was unable to penetrate the rachis of the spikelets. Protein fusion with GFP showed that EBR1 is localized in the nucleus of both conidia and hyphae. Knocking out the orthologous gene FOXG_05408 in F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici caused a much weaker phenotype than the PH-1?ebr1 mutant, which may be due to the presence of multiple orthologous genes in this fungus. Transformation of FOXG_05408 into PH-1?ebr1 restored the mutant phenotype. Similar to EBR1, FOXG_05408 is localized in the nucleus of F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. Possible functions of EBR1 and its relation with other fungal transcription factors are discussed."

'Modus', via wide crossing with maize, were used to create a genetic linkage map of triticale. The map has 21 linkage groups assigned to the A, B, and R genomes including 155 simple sequence repeat (SSR), 1385 diversity array technology (DArT), and 28 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers covering 2397 cM with a mean distance between two markers of 4.1 cM. Comparative analysis with wheat consensus maps revealed that triticale chromosomes of the A and B genomes were represented by 15 chromosomes, including combinations of 2AS.2AL#, 2AL#2BL, 6AS.6AL#, and 2BS.6AL# instead of 2A, 2B, and 6A. In respect to published maps of rye, substantial rearrangements were found also for chromosomes 1R, 2R, and 3R of the rye genome. Chromosomes 1R and 2R were truncated and the latter was linked with 3R. A nonhomogeneous distribution of markers across the triticale genome was observed with evident bias (48%) towards the rye genome. This genetic map may serve as a reference linkage map of triticale for efficient studies of structural rearrangements, gene mapping, and marker-assisted selection."
"21564546","articletitle","Heme oxygenase-1 is associated with wheat salinity acclimation by modulating reactive oxygen species homeostasis."
"21564546","abstracttext","Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) has been recently identified as an endogenous signaling system in animals. In this study, HO-1 upregulation and its role in acquired salt tolerance (salinity acclimation) were investigated in wheat plants. We discovered that pretreatment with a low concentration of NaCl (25 mmol/L) not only led to the induction of HO-1 protein and gene expression, as well as enhanced HO activity, but also to a salinity acclimatory response thereafter. The effect is specific for HO-1, since the potent HO-1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin IX blocks the above cytoprotective actions, and the cytotoxic responses conferred by 200 mmol/L NaCl are reversed partially when HO-1 inducer hemin is added. Heme oxygenase catalytic product, carbon monoxide (CO) aqueous solution pretreatment, mimicked the salinity acclimatory responses. Meanwhile, the CO-triggered re-establishment of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis was mainly guaranteed by the induction of total and isozymatic activities, or corresponding transcripts of superoxide dismutase, ascorbate peroxidase, and cytosolic peroxidase (POD), as well as the downregulation of NADPH oxidase expression and cell-wall POD activity. A requirement of hydrogen peroxide homeostasis for HO-1-mediated salinity acclimation was also discovered. Taken together, the above results suggest that the upregulation of HO-1 expression was responsible for the observed salinity acclimation through the regulation of ROS homeostasis."

"21521001","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a potent mycotoxin and virulence factor produced by Fusarium graminearum. We examined the expression of the core DON biosynthetic gene Tri5 during wheat head infection of susceptible and resistant cultivars and susceptible cultivars treated with strobilurin fungicides (e.g., azoxystrobin). DON was quantified to correlate expression with toxin accumulation. The highest Tri5 expression relative to housekeeping genes occurred at the infection front. As infection progressed, earliest-infected kernels showed diminished relative Tri5 expression but Tri5 expression never ceased during the 21 days observed. Azoxystrobin treatment showed no significant effect on either relative Tri5 expression or DON quantity. The resistant cultivar 'Alsen' showed minimal spread of the fungus, with no fungus detected by day 21. DON was not detected in significant quantities in Alsen in the later stages sampled. In Wheaten, DON levels were negligible at 8 days postinoculation (dpi), with detectable DON at later-sampled time points. Tri5 was detected even in fully senesced kernels 21 dpi. Our data demonstrate the presence of Tri5 transcripts in a susceptible cultivar over a much longer time period than has been previously documented. This suggests the ability of the fungus to rapidly resume toxin biosynthesis in dried infected grain should conducive environmental conditions be present, and provides a possible mechanism for high DON levels in asymptomatic grain."

"22004876","abstracttext","This study was conducted to assess evolutionary relationships, species diversity and trichothecene toxin potential of five Fusarium graminearum complex (FGSC) isolates identified as genetically novel during prior Fusarium head blight (FHB) surveys in Nepal and Louisiana. Results of a multilocus genotyping (MLGT) assay for B-trichothecene species determination indicated these isolates might represent novel species within the FGSC. GCPSR-based phylogenetic analyses of a 12-gene dataset, comprising portions of seven loci totaling 13.1 kb of aligned DNA sequence data, provided strong support for the genealogical exclusivity of the Nepalese and Louisianan isolates. Accordingly, both species are formally recognized herein as novel FGSC species. Fusarium nepalense was resolved as the sister lineage of Fusarium ussurianum+Fusarium asiaticum within an Asian subclade of the FGSC. Fusarium louisianense was strongly supported as a reciprocally monophyletic sister of Fusarium gerlachii+F. graminearum, suggesting that this subclade might be endemic to North America. Multilocus Bayesian species tree analyses augment these results and provide evidence for a distinct lineage within F. graminearum predominately from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana. As predicted by the MLGT assay, mycotoxin analyses demonstrated that F. nepalense and F. louisianense could produce 15ADON and nivalenol, respectively, in planta. In addition, both species were only able to induce mild FHB symptoms on wheat in pathogenicity experiments."

To construct a physical map of the Ae. tauschii genome, we fingerprinted 461,706 bacterial artificial chromosome clones, assembled contigs, designed a 10K Ae. tauschii Infinium SNP array, constructed a 7,185-marker genetic map, and anchored on the map contigs totaling 4.03 Gb. Using whole genome shotgun reads, we extended the SNP marker sequences and found 17,093 genes and gene fragments. We showed that collinearity of the Ae. tauschii genes with Brachypodium distachyon, rice, and sorghum decreased with phylogenetic distance and that structural genome evolution rates have been high across all investigated lineages in subfamily Pooideae, including that of Brachypodieae. We obtained additional information about the evolution of the seven Triticeae chromosomes from 12 ancestral chromosomes and uncovered a pattern of centromere inactivation accompanying nested chromosome insertions in grasses. We showed that the density of noncollinear genes along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes positively correlates with recombination rates, suggested a cause, and showed that new genes, exemplified by disease resistance genes, are preferentially located in high-recombination chromosome regions."

"22904035","abstracttext","Tef (Eragrostis tef) is a major cereal crop in Ethiopia. Lodging is the primary constraint to increasing productivity in this allotetraploid species, accounting for losses of ∼15-45% in yield each year. As a first step toward identifying semi-dwarf varieties that might have improved lodging resistance, an ∼6× fosmid library was constructed and used to identify both homeologues of the dw3 semi-dwarfing gene of Sorghum bicolor. An EMS mutagenized population, consisting of ∼21,210 tef plants, was planted and leaf materials were collected into 23 superpools. Two dwarfing candidate genes, homeologues of dw3 of sorghum and rht1 of wheat, were sequenced directly from each superpool with 454 technology, and 120 candidate mutations were identified. Out of 10 candidates tested, six independent mutations were validated by Sanger sequencing, including two predicted detrimental mutations in both dw3 homeologues with a potential to improve lodging resistance in tef through further breeding. This study demonstrates that high-throughput sequencing can identify potentially valuable mutations in under-studied plant species like tef and has provided mutant lines that can now be combined and tested in breeding programs for improved lodging resistance."
"22912594","articletitle","Uncovering the genome-wide transcriptional responses of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus niger to lignocellulose using RNA sequencing."
"22912594","abstracttext","A key challenge in the production of second generation biofuels is the conversion of lignocellulosic substrates into fermentable sugars. Enzymes, particularly those from fungi, are a central part of this process, and many have been isolated and characterised. However, relatively little is known of how fungi respond to lignocellulose and produce the enzymes necessary for dis-assembly of plant biomass. We studied the physiological response of the fungus Aspergillus niger when exposed to wheat straw as a model lignocellulosic substrate. Using RNA sequencing we showed that, 24 hours after exposure to straw, gene expression of known and presumptive plant cell wall-degrading enzymes represents a huge investment for the cells (about 20% of the total mRNA). Our results also uncovered new esterases and surface interacting proteins that might form part of the fungal arsenal of enzymes for the degradation of plant biomass. Using transcription factor deletion mutants (xlnR and creA) to study the response to both lignocellulosic substrates and low carbon source concentrations, we showed that a subset of genes coding for degradative enzymes is induced by starvation. Our data support a model whereby this subset of enzymes plays a scouting role under starvation conditions, testing for available complex polysaccharides and liberating inducing sugars, that triggers the subsequent induction of the majority of hydrolases. We also showed that antisense transcripts are abundant and that their expression can be regulated by growth conditions."

The main objectives were to identify SSR loci that were the best indicators of genetic diversity, to measure the genetic diversity within popcorn genotypes, and to analyze the genetic structure of the promising populations destined for use in breeding programs. The mean gene diversity of all SSR loci was 0.6352. An extremely high population differentiation level was detected (F(st) = 0.3152) with F(st) for each locus ranging from 0.1125 (Umc1229) to 0.4870 (Umc1755). Analyzing the genetic structure of eight popcorn accessions was especially important for identifying both SSR loci with high levels of heterozygosity and genotypes showing high heterozygosity (BOYA462 and ARZM13 050). This analysis should be the medium and long-term selection goal for the generation of inbred lines and the future production of new cultivars.

"19153613","articletitle","Plant MTs-long neglected members of the metallothionein superfamily."
"19153613","abstracttext","Occurrence of metallothioneins (MTs) was initially thought to be restricted to the animal kingdom, and the corresponding functions such as detoxification of heavy metal ions were assumed to be taken over in plants by the enzymatically synthesized phytochelatins. This perception was revised in the past years, and the existence of plant metallothioneins is generally accepted. Compared to the vertebrate forms, members of the plant MT family display a significantly larger sequence diversity, however, surprisingly little information is available concerning their possible functions, properties, and structures. Gene expression studies, and thus studies on the mRNA level, are the major source of data aiming at elucidating the function of plant MTs. However, so far it is not possible to unambiguously assign a specific function to a given metallothionein as proposed functions overlap, are complementary to each other, or even contradictory results are obtained. With respect to the structures and properties of plant metallothioneins even less scientific contributions are available illustrating the early stages, in which this research area resides. Existing data covers the metal ion content of the different plant metallothionein species and the pH stabilities of the resulting metal-thiolate clusters. Further, for a limited selection of proteins the number of clusters formed has been proposed and predictions towards the secondary structure of the protein backbone made. A recently determined three-dimensional structure of the larger domain of the wheat metallothionein E(c)-1 describes a metal ion coordination mode unprecedented for any metallothionein so far."

However, as there has been no report about the precise amount of PS1 expressed in mammalian tissues, the aim of this study was to quantitatively determine PS1-CTF amounts in various tissues such as liver, kidney, brain and heart of rat by western blotting using a [(35)S]-methionine-labelled PS1-CTF as a standard synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesizing system. PS1-CTF contents in kidney, liver, brain and heart were 17.0, 6.6, 6.4 and 0.2 fmol/mg protein, respectively.

"19206107","abstracttext","Pyrenophora tritici-repentis causes tan spot, an important foliar disease of wheat. The fungus produces multiple host-specific toxins, including Ptr ToxB, a chlorosis-inducing protein encoded by the ToxB gene. A homolog of ToxB is also found in avirulent isolates of the fungus. In order to improve understanding of the role of this homolog and evaluate the general pathogenic ability of P. tritici-repentis, we compared the proteomes of avirulent race 4 and virulent race 5 isolates of the pathogen. Western blotting analysis revealed the presence of Ptr ToxB in spore germination and culture fluids of race 5 but not race 4. A comprehensive proteome-level comparison by 2-DE indicated 133 differentially abundant proteins in the secretome (29 proteins) and mycelium (104 proteins) of races 4 and 5, of which 63 were identified by MS/MS. A number of the proteins found to be up-regulated in race 5 have been implicated in microbial virulence in other pathosystems, and included the secreted enzymes alpha-mannosidase and exo-beta-1,3-glucanase, heat-shock and BiP proteins, and various metabolic enzymes. These proteome-level differences suggest a reduced general pathogenic ability in race 4 of P. tritici-repentis, irrespective of toxin production. Such differences may reflect an adaptation to a saprophytic habit."

"19481148","abstracttext","A cDNA encoding a cathepsin L-like cysteine proteinase (DcCathL) was prepared from gut tissue of larvae of wheat bulb fly (Delia coarctata: Diptera). The predicted protein is a homologue of the product of Drosophila melanogaster gene Cp-1 (CG6692), and is similar to a sub-family of cysteine proteinases found in other insects which have roles in tissue remodelling during development, and moulting. Recombinant DcCathL was produced using the yeast Pichia pastoris as expression host, and showed hydrolytic activity in vitro towards the synthetic substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC with a pH optimum of 4.5. DcCathL was insecticidal to lepidopteran larvae when injected into haemolymph, causing mortality that was accompanied by systemic melanisation, suggesting that DcCathL was affecting the immune-related proteolytic activation cascade leading to production of active phenoloxidase. This process is normally negatively regulated by serpins in the haemolymph. Recombinant serpins from cabbage moth (Mamestra brassicae) did not inhibit DcCathL, and were susceptible to degradation by the enzyme in vitro in buffer and extracted haemolymph. When M. brassicae larvae were co-injected with a lethal dose of DcCathL and exogenous recombinant serpins, no mortality or systemic melanisation was observed, suggesting that the insecticidal effects of DcCathL in vivo result from degradation of endogenous serpins."

"19400646","abstracttext","Quantitative disease resistance (QDR) has been observed within many crop plants but is not as well understood as qualitative (monogenic) disease resistance and has not been used as extensively in breeding. Mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) is a powerful tool for genetic dissection of QDR. DNA markers tightly linked to quantitative resistance loci (QRLs) controlling QDR can be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) to incorporate these valuable traits. QDR confers a reduction, rather than lack, of disease and has diverse biological and molecular bases as revealed by cloning of QRLs and identification of the candidate gene(s) underlying QRLs. Increasing our biological knowledge of QDR and QRLs will enhance understanding of how QDR differs from qualitative resistance and provide the necessary information to better deploy these resources in breeding. Application of MAS for QRLs in breeding for QDR to diverse pathogens is illustrated by examples from wheat, barley, common bean, tomato, and pepper. Strategies for optimum deployment of QRLs require research to understand effects of QDR on pathogen populations over time."

"19428689","abstracttext","Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), an initial and rate-limiting enzyme for the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan (Trp) metabolism, is thought to play an important role in systemic Trp metabolism as well as in emotional and psychiatric status. In contrast to its predominant expression in the liver, expression of TDO in the brain is poorly understood. Here, we show that tdo mRNA is expressed in various nervous tissues, including the hippocampus, cerebellum, striatum and brainstem. During development, tdo mRNA was differentially regulated in brain tissues. Further, we identified two novel variants of the tdo gene, termed tdo variant1 and variant2. Similar tetramer formation and enzymatic activity were obtained when these forms were expressed in wheat germ and COS-7 cells, respectively. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that tdo variants were expressed in various nervous tissues, with high expression in the cerebellum and hippocampus, followed by the midbrain. tdo variant2 was the only variant expressed in the cerebellum from postnatal day 4 (P4) to P7, suggesting a unique role for this variant during early postnatal development. Our findings indicate that tdo and its novel variants may play an important role in not only the liver but also in local areas in developing and adult brain."

"19570502","abstracttext","Wheat yellow rust (Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici) (PST) has been described as a strongly clonal species in both European and Australian populations, with very limited molecular diversity but rapidly evolving virulences. Contrastingly, marked genetic diversity has been reported in Chinese PST populations. To test whether such variability could originate from oversummering areas, we assessed the diversity of virulence and molecular markers (AFLP and SSR) using 412 PST isolates from the highlands of Tianshui county in Gansu province. Very marked phenotypic and genotypic diversity (38% and 89%, respectively) was found. No genetic structure dependent on the sites sampled (Fst=0.004) or altitude distribution (Fst=0.0098) was detected, indicating important gene flow at the county scale. This study also revealed genetic recombination between molecular markers and thus strongly suggests the existence of a sexual or parasexual cycle in PST in Tianshui county. The observations of higher rates of sexual spore production in genotypes originating from Tianshui are the very first elements suggestive of the existence of a sexual cycle in this species."

"21076812","abstracttext","We carried out a genome-wide analysis of polymorphism (4,596 SNP loci across 190 elite cultivated accessions) chosen to represent the available genetic variation in current elite North West European and North American barley germplasm. Population sub-structure, patterns of diversity and linkage disequilibrium varied considerably across the seven barley chromosomes. Gene-rich and rarely recombining haplotype blocks that may represent up to 60% of the physical length of barley chromosomes extended across the 'genetic centromeres'. By positioning 2,132 bi-parentally mapped SNP markers with minimum allele frequencies higher than 0.10 by association mapping, 87.3% were located to within 5 cM of their original genetic map position. We show that at this current marker density genetically diverse populations of relatively small size are sufficient to fine map simple traits, providing they are not strongly stratified within the sample, fall outside the genetic centromeres and population sub-structure is effectively controlled in the analysis. Our results have important implications for association mapping, positional cloning, physical mapping and practical plant breeding in barley and other major world cereals including wheat and rye that exhibit comparable genome and genetic features."

"21094265","abstracttext","Autophagy is a non-selective degradation pathway in eukaryotic cells that is conserved from yeasts to humans. Autophagy is involved in the virulence of several pathogenic fungi such as Magnaporthe grisea or Colletotrichum orbiculare. In the current study, we identified and disrupted an autophagy-like lipase FgATG15 in Fusarium graminearum. We showed that FgATG15 exhibits lipase activity when heterologously expressed in P. pastoris. We used a gene deletion approach to characterize the function of the enzyme. We demonstrate that FgATG15 is involved in fungal growth and aerial hyphae production. FgATG15 is also involved in conidia production and germination, and disruption of FgATG15 led to aberrant conidia shapes. FgATG15 disruptants were reduced in storage lipid degradation under starvation conditions, implicating FgATG15's involvement in lipid turnover. Moreover, wheat head infection by the disruptants was severely attenuated, indicating the involvement of FgATG15 in pathogenesis. Additionally, we found that the deoxynivalenol levels of FgATG15 disruptants were significantly decreased compared with the wild type strain. Taken together, we show that FgATG15 is involved in numerous developmental processes and could be exploited as an antifungal target."

"21059180","abstracttext","Fungi of the genus Fusarium are important plant pathogens and contaminants of cereal grains producing different types of mycotoxins. Enniatins are a group of mycotoxins with ionophoric properties frequently detected in North European grains. Within the Fusarium complex responsible for grain infection, Fusarium avenaceum, Fusarium poae and Fusarium tricinctum are the most potential enniatins producers. This study presents the development of two quantitative TaqMan MGB (Minor Groove Binder) assays for the specific quantification of F. avenaceum/F. tricinctum and F. poae esyn1 genotypes, respectively. Two sets of genotype-specific primers/probes were designed on the basis of esyn1 gene homologues encoding multifunctional enzyme enniatin synthetase. The specificity of the assays developed has been tested successfully on 111 Fusarium isolates from different geographical origins. The detection limits for F. avenaceum/F. tricinctum esyn1 genotype and F. poae genotype were 19 and 0.3 pg, respectively. The application of the assays developed on asymptomatic wheat grain samples revealed significant positive correlations between the enniatins levels and the amount of F. avenaceum/F. tricinctum esyn1 genotype (R=0.61) and F. poae esyn1 genotype (R=0.42)."

"20739548","abstracttext","Leptin, the adipose-derived hormonal signal of body energy stores, acts via the leptin receptor (LepRb) on neurons in multiple brain regions. We previously identified LepRb neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), which are distinct from neighboring leptin-regulated melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH)- or orexin (OX)-expressing cells. Neither the direct synaptic targets of LHA LepRb neurons nor their potential role in the regulation of other LHA neurons has been determined, however. We thus generated several adenoviral and transgenic systems in which cre recombinase promotes the expression of the tracer, WGA (wheat germ agglutinin), and used these in combination with LepRb(cre) mice to determine the neuronal targets of LHA LepRb neurons. This analysis revealed that, although some LHA LepRb neurons project to dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, LHA LepRb neurons also densely innervate the LHA where they directly synapse with OX, but not MCH, neurons. Indeed, few other LepRb neurons in the brain project to the OX-containing region of the mouse LHA, and direct leptin action via LHA LepRb neurons regulates gene expression in OX neurons. These findings thus reveal a major role for LHA leptin action in the modulation of OX neurons, suggesting the importance of LHA LepRb neurons in the regulation of OX signaling that is crucial to leptin action and metabolic control."

"20690165","abstracttext","Metabolomic approach has become a very important tool for determining the actual gene expression and protein activity. Metabolism via the shikimate pathway in plant gives rise to a large number of aromatic compounds, including p-hydroxycinnamates, which are mainly associated with their cell walls in complex structures, ester-linked to heteroxilans. In this work, ferulate dehydrodimers and related compounds were extracted from the cell walls of young lyophilized wheat plants with 2 mol/l NaOH for 4 h at 25 °C under N(2). After solid phase extraction, samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-linear ion trap tandem mass spectrometry with the electrospray source operating in negative mode. Nineteen dehydrodiferulates, 2 hydrate forms, 3 oxo- forms, 2 decarboxilated forms and 1 dihydroxysinapate, were identified by mass spectra interpretation. In addition, five mixed dehydrodimers of ferulic-sinapic, ferulic-coumaric and ferulic-syringic acids were also identified. Reproducibility of peak areas was usually better than 10% but some minor components which may be procedural artefacts, although relatively mild conditions were used."

"20730601","abstracttext","Among several yeasts isolated from dried flowers of Woodfordia fruticosa, Pichia anomala produced a high titre of cell-bound phytase. The optimization of fermentation variables led to formulation of media and selection of cultural variables that supported enhanced phytase production. The enzyme productivity was very high in fed batch fermentation in air-lift fermentor as compared to that in stirred tank fermentor. Amelioration in the cell-bound phytase activity was observed when yeast cells were permeabilized with Triton-X-100. The enzyme is thermostable and acid stable with broad substrate specificity, the characteristics that are desirable for enzymes to be used in the animal feed industry. The phytase-encoding gene was cloned and sequenced. The 3D structure of the enzyme was proposed by comparative modeling using phytase of Debaryomyces occidentalis (50% sequence identity) as template. When broiler chicks, and fresh water and marine fishes were fed with the feed supplemented with yeast biomass containing phytase, improvement in growth and phosphorus retention, and decrease in the excretion of phosphorus in the faeces were recorded. The cell-bound phytase of P. anomala could effectively dephytinize wheat flour and soymilk."

"20734278","abstracttext","DNA methylation is a prominent epigenetic mark and extensively found within plant genomes. It has two major roles- first, defending the genome against invasive DNA and second, regulation of gene expression. Since the first report of 5-methylcytosine found in wheat germ, many improvements in detection of methylated cytosine residues have been made and genome-wide methylation maps for Arabidopsis thaliana are now available. The development of fast, reproducible, and single-base pair resolving detection methods for DNA methylation at defined loci advanced our understanding of the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation patterns. Bisulphite conversion of unmethylated cytosine residues followed by detection methods such as sequencing of distinct loci has become accepted as the gold standard for detecting 5-methylcytosines. Treatment of single-stranded DNA with bisulphite under acidic conditions leads to the conversion of cytosine residues to uracil whereas 5-methylcytosine is less sensitive and remains unchanged. Here, a detailed protocol for bisulphite conversion, primer design, and optimization of PCR conditions is given. Specific requirements for plant DNA are discussed."

"21190437","abstracttext","Rust fungi cause devastating diseases of wheat and other cereal species globally. Genetic resistance is the preferred method to control rusts but the effectiveness of race-specific resistance is typically transient due to the genetic plasticity of rust populations. The advent of RNA interference (RNAi) technology has shown promise for the engineering of resistance to some biotrophic pathogens in plants by altering the expression of essential pathogens' genes. Gene fragments from the rust fungi Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici or P. graminis f. sp. tritici were delivered to plant cells through the Barley stripe mosaic virus system, and some reduced the expression of the corresponding genes in the rust fungus. The ability to detect suppression was associated with the expression patterns of the fungal genes because reduction was only detected in transcripts with relatively high levels of expression in fungal haustoria. The results indicate that an in planta RNAi approach can be used in functional genomics research for rust fungi and that it could potentially be used to engineer durable resistance."

"21144868","abstracttext","Strains of fluorescent pseudomonads producing 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) are involved in the protection of plant roots against soil-borne plant pathogens. Recently, a multilocus sequence analysis of a world wide collection of DAPG-producers led to the identification of six main groups (A-F). In this study a T-RFLP method based on the phlD gene was developed to efficiently identify the members of these six groups in environmental samples. A combination of six restriction enzymes was identified which leads to group specific terminal fragments (T-RF). The detection limit of the phlD-T-RFLP method was determined for the two P. fluorescens strains F113 (group B) and CHA0 (group F) in rhizosphere samples and was found to be 5×10(3)CFU/g and 5×10(4)CFU/g respectively. PhlD-T-RFLP and phlD-DGGE analysis of wheat and maize root samples from greenhouse and field revealed similarly the presence of multilocus groups A, B and D. However, they were more frequently detected with phlD-T-RFLP. Additionally, groups C and F were detected in greenhouse samples but only by phlD-T-RFLP and not by phlD-DGGE. In conclusion, the new phlD-T-RFLP method proved to be a fast and reliable method to detect strains of the six main groups of DAPG-producers in environmental samples with an improved detection limit compared to phlD-DGGE."

"21203917","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum (sexual stage: Gibberella zeae) is the causative agent of Fusarium Head Blight (FHB), which is one of the most destructive plant disease of cereals, accounting for high grain yield losses, especially for wheat and maize. Like other fungal pathogens, several extracellular enzymes secreted by G. zeae are known to be involved in host infection. Among these secreted lipases, G. zeae lipase (GZEL), which is encoded by the FGL1 gene, was demonstrated to be crucial to G. zeae pathogenicity. However, the precise mechanism of GZEL remains unclear due to a lack of detailed structural information. In this study, we report the crystal structure of GZEL at the atomic level. The structure of GZEL displays distinct structural differences compared to reported homologues and indicates a unique ""double lock"" enzymatic mechanism. To gain insight into substrate/inhibitor recognition, we proposed a model of GZEL in complex with substrate and the lipase inhibitor ebelactone B (based on the reported structures of GZEL homologues), which defines possible substrate binding sites within the catalytic cleft and suggests an ""anti sn-l"" binding mode. These results pave the way to elucidating the mechanism of GZEL and thus provide clues for the design of anti-FHB inhibitors."

Previous DNA marker analyses of the F. graminearum clade from maize in Nepal found a high level of genetic diversity but were limited in detail or scope. The present study incorporated a collection of 251 field strains from a wide geographic distribution in Nepal and utilized sequencing of the MAT1-1-3 gene of the mating type locus to determine the number and frequency of lineages and species of the F. graminearum clade. The frequency of nivalenol and deoxynivalenol chemotypes was determined by chemical analysis and by TRI13 deletion-marker analysis. We found that Gibberella ear rot of maize in Nepal is associated with a complex of species of the F. graminearum clade - mainly Fusarium asiaticum and Fusarium meridionale, but also Fusarium boothii and a putative new lineage, which we have designated the 'Nepal lineage'. Fusarium graminearum sensu stricto, which dominates in maize elsewhere in Asia and worldwide, was not detected in Nepal. Although nivalenol production has been associated experimentally with lower virulence in maize ear rot and wheat head blight, this collection of the F. graminearum clade from maize in Nepal is dominated (4:1) by nivalenol producers, suggesting that traits other than crop plant pathogenesis affect population structure in this complex agroecosystem."

"20976139","abstracttext","The pooid subfamily of grasses includes some of the most important crop, forage and turf species, such as wheat, barley and Lolium. Developing genomic resources, such as whole-genome physical maps, for analysing the large and complex genomes of these crops and for facilitating biological research in grasses is an important goal in plant biology. We describe a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based physical map of the wild pooid grass Brachypodium distachyon and integrate this with whole genome shotgun sequence (WGS) assemblies using BAC end sequences (BES). The resulting physical map contains 26 contigs spanning the 272 Mb genome. BES from the physical map were also used to integrate a genetic map. This provides an independent validation and confirmation of the published WGS assembly. Mapped BACs were used in Fluorescence In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) experiments to align the integrated physical map and sequence assemblies to chromosomes with high resolution. The physical, genetic and cytogenetic maps, integrated with whole genome shotgun sequence assemblies, enhance the accuracy and durability of this important genome sequence and will directly facilitate gene isolation."

This is a world-wide problem which requires rapid and sensitive detection methods. To allow for high throughput screening of large numbers of samples, a diagnostic PCR method was developed for the simultaneous detection of F. avenaceum and F. tricinctum. The interspecific divergence found in the Fusarium-specific CYP51C gene was used to design species-specific PCR primers. The specificity of the assay was demonstrated for DNA samples extracted from a wide range of Fusarium species belonging to the Fusarium head blight (FHB) complex, as well as for naturally-infected grain samples. The PCR-amplified products were digested with the restriction enzyme XbaI to enable differentiation between F. avenaceum and F. tricinctum. This PCR- restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay proved to be a simple and relatively inexpensive method highly suited for routine detection and identification of F. avenaceum and F. tricinctum in wheat samples."

"21536894","abstracttext","Rust fungi are some of the most devastating pathogens of crop plants. They are obligate biotrophs, which extract nutrients only from living plant tissues and cannot grow apart from their hosts. Their lifestyle has slowed the dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying host invasion and avoidance or suppression of plant innate immunity. We sequenced the 101-Mb genome of Melampsora larici-populina, the causal agent of poplar leaf rust, and the 89-Mb genome of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat and barley stem rust. We then compared the 16,399 predicted proteins of M. larici-populina with the 17,773 predicted proteins of P. graminis f. sp tritici. Genomic features related to their obligate biotrophic lifestyle include expanded lineage-specific gene families, a large repertoire of effector-like small secreted proteins, impaired nitrogen and sulfur assimilation pathways, and expanded families of amino acid and oligopeptide membrane transporters. The dramatic up-regulation of transcripts coding for small secreted proteins, secreted hydrolytic enzymes, and transporters in planta suggests that they play a role in host infection and nutrient acquisition. Some of these genomic hallmarks are mirrored in the genomes of other microbial eukaryotes that have independently evolved to infect plants, indicating convergent adaptation to a biotrophic existence inside plant cells."

"21530591","abstracttext","Use of the yeast two-hybrid assay to study Plasmodium falciparum protein-protein interactions is limited by poor expression of P. falciparum genes in yeast and lack of easily implemented assays to confirm the results. We report here two methods to create gene fragments - random fragmentation by partial DNAse I digestion and generation of densely overlapping fragments by PCR - that enable most portions of P. falciparum genes to be expressed and screened in the yeast two-hybrid assay. The PCR-based method is less technically challenging and facilitates fine-scale mapping of protein interaction domains. Both approaches revealed a putative interaction between PfMyb2 (PF10_0327) and PFC0365w. We developed new plasmids to express the proteins in wheat germ extracts and confirmed the interaction in both the split-luciferase assay and in co-purification experiments with glutathione-S-transferase and HA-tagged proteins. The combination of improved yeast two-hybrid screening approaches and convenient systems to validate interactions enhances the utility of yeast two-hybrid assays for P. falciparum."

"21512773","abstracttext","Rapid and uniform seed germination under diverse environmental conditions is a desirable characteristic for most crop plants, such as rice, wheat, and maize. However, the genetic base of the variations in the rate of germination is not well understood. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTL) for germination rate were mapped with a set of 143 chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) each contains a small genomic fragment from a japonica variety Nipponbare in the uniform genetic background of an indica variety Zhenshan97. Nine CSSL showed significantly lower germination rate than that in Zhenshan97. Four germination-related QTL were identified located on chromosomes 2, 5, 6 and 10, at which all japonica alleles decreased germination rate. By using the CSSL-derived F2 population, a major QTL (qGR2) on chromosome 2 was confirmed, and delimited to a 10.4 kb interval containing three putative candidate genes, of which OsMADS29 was only expressed preferentially in the seed. These results would facilitate cloning of the major gene that affects germination rate, and provide an insight into the genetic basis of germination."

"21467573","abstracttext","Speciation via interspecific or intergeneric hybridization and polyploidization triggers genomic responses involving genetic and epigenetic alterations. Such modifications may be induced by small RNAs, which affect key cellular processes, including gene expression, chromatin structure, cytosine methylation and transposable element (TE) activity. To date, the role of small RNAs in the context of wide hybridization and polyploidization has received little attention. In this work, we performed high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs of parental, intergeneric hybrid, and allopolyploid plants that mimic the genomic changes occurring during bread wheat speciation. We found that the percentage of small RNAs corresponding to miRNAs increased with ploidy level, while the percentage of siRNAs corresponding to TEs decreased. The abundance of most miRNA species was similar to midparent values in the hybrid, with some deviations, as seen in overrepresentation of miR168, in the allopolyploid. In contrast, the number of siRNAs corresponding to TEs strongly decreased upon allopolyploidization, but not upon hybridization. The reduction in corresponding siRNAs, together with decreased CpG methylation, as shown here for the Veju element, represent hallmarks of TE activation. TE-siRNA downregulation in the allopolyploid may contribute to genome destabilization at the initial stages of speciation. This phenomenon is reminiscent of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila."

A field experiment in China Ozone Free-Air Concentration Enrichment (FACE-O(3)) facility on a rice-wheat rotation system was carried out to investigate responses of anoxygenic phototrophic purple bacteria (AnPPB) to elevated ground-level O(3). AnPPB community structures and sizes in paddy soil were monitored by molecular approaches including PCR-DGGE and real-time quantitative PCR based upon the pufM gene on three typical rice growth stages. Repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) in combination with culture-reliant method was conducted to reveal changes in genotypic diversity. Elevated ground-level O(3) statistically reduce AnPPB abundance and percentage in total bacterial community in flooded rice soil via decreasing their genotypic diversity and metabolic versatility. Concomitantly, their community composition changed after rice anthesis stage under elevated ground-level O(3). Our results from AnPPB potential responses imply that continuously elevated ground-level O(3) in the future would eventually harm the health of paddy ecosystem through negative effect on soil microorganisms."

"21695137","abstracttext","The mitochondrial transcriptome from land plants undergoes hundreds of specific C-to-U changes by RNA editing. These events are important since most of them occur in the coding region of mRNAs. One challenging question is to understand the mechanism of recognition of a selected C residue (editing sites) on the transcript. It has been reported that a short region surrounding the target C forms the cis-recognition elements, but individual residues on it do not play similar roles for the different editing sites. Here, we studied the role of the -1 and +1 nucleotide in wheat cox2 editing site recognition using an in organello approach. We found that four different recognition patterns can be distinguished: (a) +1 dependency, (b) -1 dependency, (c) +1/-1 dependency, and (d) no dependency on nearest neighbor residues. A striking observation was that whereas a 23 nt cis region is necessary for editing, some mutants affect the editing efficiency of unmodified distant sites. As a rule, mutations or pre-edited variants of the transcript have an impact on the complete set of editing targets. When some Cs were changed into Us, the remaining editing sites presented a higher efficiency of C-to-U conversion than in wild type mRNA. Our data suggest that the complex response observed for cox2 mRNA may be a consequence of the fate of the transcript during mitochondrial gene expression."

"21659664","abstracttext","Salivary secretions of neonate Hessian fly larvae initiate a two-way exchange of molecules with their wheat host. Changes in properties of the leaf surface allow larval effectors to enter the plant where they trigger plant processes leading to resistance and delivery of defence molecules, or susceptibility and delivery of nutrients. To increase understanding of the host plant's response, the timing and characteristics of the induced epidermal permeability were investigated. Resistant plant permeability was transient and limited in area, persisting just long enough to deliver defence molecules before gene expression and permeability reverted to pre-infestation levels. The abundance of transcripts for GDSL-motif lipase/hydrolase, thought to contribute to cuticle reorganization and increased permeability, followed the same temporal profile as permeability in resistant plants. In contrast, susceptible plants continued to increase in permeability over time until the entire crown of the plant became a nutrient sink. Permeability increased with higher infestation levels in susceptible but not in resistant plants. The ramifications of induced plant permeability on Hessian fly populations are discussed."

"21793408","abstracttext","An efficient cellulose degrading bacteria exists in the thermophilic wheat straw-degrading community, WDC2. However, this strain cannot be isolated and cultured using conventional separation techniques under strict anaerobic conditions. We successfully isolated a strain of effective cellulose degrading bacteria CTL-6 using a wash, heat shock, and solid-liquid alternating process. Analysis of its properties revealed that, although the community containing the strain CTL-6 grew under aerobic conditions, the purified strain CTL-6 only grew under anaerobic culture conditions. The strain CTL-6 had a striking capability of degrading cellulose (80.9% weight loss after 9 days of culture). The highest efficiency value of the endocellulase (CMCase activity) was 0.404 micromol/(min mL), cellulose degradation efficiency by CTL-6 was remarkably high at 50-65 degrees C with the highest degradation efficiency observed at 60 degrees C. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis indicated that the closest relative to strain CTL-6 belonged to the genus Clostridium thermocellum. Strain CTL-6 was capable of utilizing cellulose, cellobiose, and glucose. Strain CTL-6 also grew with Sorbitol as the sole carbon source, whereas C. thermocellum is unable to do so."

Here, we report the isolation of the complete glutamine synthetase gene sequences and their localization on the two homeologous chromosome 2A and 2B in durum wheat cvs. Ciccio and Svevo characterized by a different grain protein content. GS2-A2 located on 2A chromosome is comprised of 13 exons separated by 12 introns, and the allele sequence in the two cultivars were different for an insertion of 5 bp located in the third exon in the cv. Ciccio. The GS2-B2 has the same intron/exon structure, but the two cultivars differ for the insertion of a 33-bp sequence located in the second intron of the cv. Svevo. Specific primers were designed in the polymorphic region and amplified in a recombinant inbred line mapping population. The study localized GS genes (GS2-A2, GS2-B2 GSe, GSr) on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 4A, and 4B, where four significant QTLs for GPC were also located."

"21757926","abstracttext","The gene estF27, encoding a protein with feruloyl esterase activity, was cloned through functional screening from a soil metagenomic library and expressed in Escherichiacoli BL21 (DE3) with high solubility. Sequence analysis showed that estF27 encoded a protein of 291 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 31.16 kDa. According to the substrate specificity, EstF27 was classified as a type A feruloyl esterase. EstF27 displayed optimal activity at 40°C and pH 6.8. This enzyme was stable in a broad pH range of 5.0-10.0 over 24 h, and retained more than 50% of its activity after 96 or 120 h incubation in the presence of 3 M KCl or 5 M NaCl. The enzyme activity was slightly enhanced by the addition of Mg(2+) and Fe(3+) at a low concentration, and completely inhibited by Cu(2+). In the enzymatic hydrolysis of destarched wheat bran, EstF27 could release ferulic acid from it in the presence of xylanase from Thermomyces lanuginosus. Given its alkalitolerance, halotolerance and highly soluble expression, EstF27 is a promising candidate for industrial applications."

"21761175","abstracttext","Isoproturon, 3-p-cumenyl-1 dimethylurea was the only herbicide controlling Phalaris minor, a major weed growing in wheat fields till the early 1980s. Since it has acquired resistance against isoproturon, like other substituted urea herbicides, where the identified target site for isoproturon is in the photosynthetic apparatus at D1 protein of Photosystem-II (PS-II). Nucleotide sequence of susceptible and resistant psbA gene of P. minor has been reported to have four point mutations. During the present work D1 protein of both susceptible and resistant biotypes of P Minor has been modeled. Transmembrane segments of amino acids were predicted by comparing with the nearest homolog of bacterial D1 protein. Volume and area of active site of both susceptible and resistant biotypes has been simulated. Isoproturon was docked at the active site of both, susceptible and resistant D1 proteins. Modeling and simulation of resistance D1 protein indicates that the resistance is due to alteration in secondary structure near the binding site, resulting in loss in cavity area, volume and change in binding position, loss of hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interaction and complete loss of hydrophobic sites. To regain sensitivity in resistant biotype new derivatives of isoproturon molecules have been proposed, synthesized and tested. Among the 17 derivatives we found that the N-methyl triazole substituted isoproturon is a potential substitute for isoproturon."

"22039925","abstracttext","• Lack of grain dormancy in cereal crops such as barley and wheat is a common problem affecting farming areas around the world, causing losses in yield and quality because of preharvest sprouting. Control of seed or grain dormancy has been investigated extensively using various approaches in different species, including Arabidopsis and cereals. However, the use of a monocot model plant such as Brachypodium distachyon presents opportunities for the discovery of new genes related to grain dormancy that are not present in modern commercial crops. • In this work we present an anatomical description of the Brachypodium caryopsis, and we describe the dormancy behaviour of six common diploid Brachypodium inbred genotypes. We also study the effect of light quality (blue, red and far-red) on germination, and analyse changes in abscisic acid levels and gene expression between a dormant and a non-dormant Brachypodium genotype. • Our results indicate that different genotypes display high natural variability in grain dormancy and that the characteristics of dormancy and germination are similar to those found in other cereals. • We propose that Brachypodium is an ideal model for studies of grain dormancy in grasses and can be used to identify new strategies for increasing grain dormancy in crop species."

When F. graminearum is grown on wheat bran hydrated with a modified synthetic medium, high xylanase activity can be extracted. The two endoxylanases were identified by LC-MS/MS as the products of genes FGSG_6445 (Genbank gene id 2788192 ) (xylanase 1) and FGSG_3624 (GenBank accession no.

Both enzymes showed a pH optimum at pH 6, with xylanase 1 exhibiting a wider active pH range (5.5-9) than xlylanase 2 (5.5-7.5). Their temperature dependences were similar, >60% between 35 and 60 °C, with optimal temperatures of 45 °C for xylanase 1 and 50 °C for xylanase 2. Kinetic studies found that both enzymes had a lower K(m) for linear beachwood xylan than arabinoxylan. For xylanase 2, the V(max) increased with arabinoxylan, but decreased for xylanase 1."

"22314388","abstracttext","The specificity of culturable bacteria on healthy and Fusarium head blight (FHB)-infected spikelets of wheat heads was investigated to find a candidate of biocontrol agents against FHB. The bacterial genus Pseudomonas was commonly isolated from the tissues, and phylogenetic analysis using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences of isolates of the genera revealed that particular phylogenetic groups in the genus specifically inhabited either healthy or infected spikelet tissues. The specificity of each group was suggested to be due to differences in the ability to form biofilms and colonize spikelet tissues; isolates originated from healthy spikelets formed biofilms on polyvinyl chloride microplate wells and highly colonized the spikelet tissues. Other bacterial groups obtained from FHB-infected spikelets less formed biofilms and attached with low densities on the spikelet tissues. Their colonization on the tissues, however, was promoted when co-inoculated with the causal pathogenic fungus, Fusarium graminearum, and several isolates were observed to smash the mycelia in vivo. Moreover, based on results of in vitro mycelial growth inhibition activity, the diseased tissue-originated isolates were verified to have a negative effect on the fungal growth. These results suggest that Pseudomonas isolates obtained from infected spikelet tissues were highly associated with the FHB pathogen and have potential as candidates for biological control against FHB."

"22265291","abstracttext","Makgeolli is a traditional Korean alcoholic beverage manufactured with a natural starter, called nuruk, and grains. Nuruk is a starchy disk or tablet formed from wheat or grist containing various fungal and bacterial strains from the surrounding environment that are allowed to incorporate naturally into the starter, each of which simultaneously participates in the makgeolli fermentation process. In the current study, changes in microbial dynamics during laboratory-scale fermentation of makgeolli inoculated with six different kinds of nuruk were evaluated by barcoded pyrosequencing using fungal- and bacterial-specific primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer 2 region and hypervariable regions V1 to V3 of the 16S rRNA gene, respectively. A total of 61,571 fungal and 68,513 bacterial sequences were used for the analysis of microbial diversity in ferment samples. During fermentation, the proportion of fungal microorganisms belonging to the family Saccharomycetaceae increased significantly, and the major bacterial phylum of the samples shifted from γ-Proteobacteria to Firmicutes. The results of quantitative PCR indicated that the bacterial content in the final ferments was higher than in commercial rice beers, while total fungi appeared similar. This is the first report of a comparative analysis of bacterial and fungal dynamics in parallel during the fermentation of Korean traditional alcoholic beverage using barcoded pyrosequencing."

"22287004","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum (Gibberella zeae) is an important pathogen of wheat, maize, barley, and rice in South Korea, and harvested grain often is contaminated with trichothecenes such as deoxynivalenol and nivalenol. In this study, we examined 568 isolates of F. graminearum collected from maize at eight locations in South Korea. We used amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) to identify four lineages (2, 3, 6, and 7); lineage 7 was the most common (75%), followed by lineage 6 (12%), lineage 3 (12%), and lineage 2 (1%). The genetic identity among populations was high (>0.98), and the effective migration rate between locations was higher than that between lineages. Female fertility varied by lineage: all lineage 7 isolates were fertile, while 70%, 26%, and 14% of the isolates in lineages 6, 3, and 2, respectively, were fertile. All lineage 3 and lineage 7 isolates produced deoxynivalenol, whereas most lineage 2 and 6 isolates produced nivalenol. Genotypic diversity in lineage 3 and lineage 6 populations is similar to that found in previously described Korean rice populations, but genotypic diversity in lineage 7 is much lower, even though similar levels of gene flow occur between lineage 7 populations. We conclude that lineage 7 was relatively recently introduced into South Korea, perhaps accompanying imported maize seeds."

"22248820","abstracttext","One approach to develop a malaria blood-stage vaccine is to target proteins that play critical roles in the erythrocyte invasion of merozoites. The merozoite surface proteins (MSPs) and the erythrocyte-binding antigens (EBAs) are considered promising vaccine candidates, for they are known to play important roles in erythrocyte invasion and are exposed to host immune system. Here we focused on a Plasmodium falciparum antigen, PfMSPDBL1 (encoded by PF10_0348 gene) that is a member of the MSP3 family and has both Duffy binding-like (DBL) domain and secreted polymorphic antigen associated with merozoites (SPAM) domain. Therefore, we aimed to characterize PfMSPDBL1 as a vaccine candidate. Recombinant full-length protein (rFL) of PfMSPDBL1 was synthesized by a wheat germ cell-free system, and rabbit antiserum was raised against rFL. We show that rabbit anti-PfMSPDBL1 antibodies inhibited erythrocyte invasion of wild type parasites in vitro in a dose dependent manner, and the specificity of inhibitory activity was confirmed using PfMSPDBL1 knockout parasites. Pre-incubation of the anti-PfMSPDBL1 antibodies with the recombinant SPAM domain had no effect on the inhibitory activity suggesting that antibodies to this region were not involved. In addition, antibodies to rFL were elicited by P. falciparum infection in malaria endemic area, suggesting the PfMSLDBL1 is immunogenic to humans. Our results suggest that PfMSPDBL1 is a novel blood-stage malaria vaccine candidate."

"22361217","abstracttext","Genetically modified (GM) crops require allergenicity and toxicity assessment of the novel protein(s) to ensure complete safety to the consumers. These assessments are performed in accordance with the guidelines proposed by Codex (2003) and ICMR (2008). The guidelines recommend sequence homology analysis as a preliminary step towards allergenicity prediction, later in vitro experiments may be performed to confirm allergenicity. In the present study, an in silico approach is employed to evaluate the allergenic potential of six transgenes routinely used for the development of GM food crops. Among the genes studied, manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and osmotin shares greater than 90% identity with Hev b 10 and Cap a 1w, respectively. Chitinase shares greater than 70% identity with allergens namely Pers a 1 and Hev b 11, and fungal chitinase showed significant IgE binding with 7 of 75 patients' sera positive to different food extracts. Glucanases (alfalfa, wheat) and glycine betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase gene share 50% homology with allergens like - Ole e 9, Cla h 10 and Alt a 10. The results demonstrate the allergenic potential of six genes and can serve as a guide for selection of transgenes to develop GM crops."

"22363714","abstracttext","A large number of Fusarium isolates was collected from blighted wheat spikes originating from 175 sampling sites, covering 15 provinces in China. Species and trichothecene chemotype determination by multilocus genotyping (MLGT) indicated that F. graminearum s. str. with the 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol (15ADON) chemotype and F. asiaticum with either the nivalenol (NIV) or the 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol (3ADON) chemotype were the dominant causal agents. Bayesian model-based clustering with allele data obtained with 12 variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) markers, detected three genetic clusters that also show distinct chemotypes. High levels of population genetic differentiation and low levels of effective number of migrants were observed between these three clusters. Additional genotypic analyses revealed that F. graminearum s. str. and F. asiaticum are sympatric. In addition, composition analysis of these clusters indicated a biased gene flow from 3ADON to NIV producers in F. asiaticum. In phenotypic analyses, F. asiaticum that produce 3ADON revealed significant advantages over F. asiaticum that produce NIV in pathogenicity, growth rate, fecundity, conidial length, trichothecene accumulation and resistance to benzimidazole. These results suggest that natural selection drives the spread of a more vigorous, more toxigenic pathogen population which also shows higher levels of fungicide resistance."

"23285044","abstracttext","Aquaporin (AQP) proteins have been shown to transport water and other small molecules through biological membranes, which is crucial for plants to combat stress caused by drought. However, the precise role of AQPs in drought stress response is not completely understood in plants. In this study, a PIP2 subgroup gene AQP, designated as TaAQP7, was cloned and characterized from wheat. Expression of TaAQP7-GFP fusion protein revealed its localization in the plasma membrane. TaAQP7 exhibited high water channel activity in Xenopus laevis oocytes and TaAQP7 transcript was induced by dehydration, and treatments with polyethylene glycol (PEG), abscisic acid (ABA) and H(2)O(2). Further, TaAQP7 was upregulated after PEG treatment and was blocked by inhibitors of ABA biosynthesis, implying that ABA signaling was involved in the upregulation of TaAQP7 after PEG treatment. Overexpression of TaAQP7 increased drought tolerance in tobacco. The transgenic tobacco lines had lower levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and H(2)O(2), and less ion leakage (IL), but higher relative water content (RWC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities when compared with the wild type (WT) under drought stress. Taken together, our results show that TaAQP7 confers drought stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco by increasing the ability to retain water, reduce ROS accumulation and membrane damage, and enhance the activities of antioxidants."

"23265541","abstracttext","Broa is a maize bread highly consumed and appreciated, especially in the north and central zones of Portugal. In the manufacturing of broa, maize flour and maize semolina might be used, besides other cereals such as wheat and rye. Considering the needs for genetically modified organism (GMO) traceability in highly processed foods, the aim of this work was to assess DNA degradation, DNA amplification and GMO quantification along breadmaking process of broa. DNA degradation was noticed by its decrease of integrity after dough baking and in all parts of bread sampling. The PCR amplification results of extracted DNA from the three distinct maize breads (broa 1, 2 and 3) showed that sequences for maize invertase gene and for events MON810 and TC1507 were easily detected with strong products. Real-time PCR revealed that quantification of GMO was feasible in the three different breads and that sampling location of baked bread might have a limited influence since the average quantitative results of both events after baking were very close to the actual values in the case of broa 1 (prepared with maize semolina). In the other two maize breads subjected to the same baking treatment, the contents of MON810 maize were considerably underestimated, leading to the conclusion that heat-processing was not the responsible parameter for that distortion, but the size of particle and mechanical processing of raw maize play also a major role in GMO quantification."

"23183383","abstracttext","Expansins are the key regulators of cell wall extension during plant growth. Previously, we produced transgenic tobacco plants with increased tolerance to water stress by overexpressing the wheat expansin gene TaEXPB23 driven by the constitutive 35S cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter. However, the growth and development of 35S::TaEXPB23 transgenic tobacco plants were altered under normal growth conditions, with a faster growth rate at the seedling stage, earlier flowering and maturation, and a shorter plant height compared to WT. In the current study, we determined that cellular characteristics and carbohydrate metabolism were altered in 35S::TaEXPB23 transgenic tobacco plants. We also generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants using the same vector. The transgenic Arabidopsis plants had the same phenotype as the transgenic tobacco plants, which may have resulted from the altered expression of several flowering-related genes. We then produced TaEXPB23 transgenic tobacco plants using the stress-inducible RD29A promoter. The use of this promoter reduced the negative effects of TaEXPB23 on plant growth and development. The RD29A::TaEXPB23 transgenic tobacco plants had greater tolerance to water stress than WT, as determined by examining physiological and biochemical parameters. Therefore, the use of stress-inducible promoters, such as RD29A, may minimize the negative effects of constitutive transgene expression and improve the water-stress tolerance of plants."

It grew at temperatures ranging from 4 to 42°C, with temperature optima at 30°C. It expressed multiple plant growth promotion attributes such as phosphate solubilization, indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophore and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, differentially at suboptimal growth temperatures (15 and 4°C). At 15°C it solubilized phosphate (21.1 μg of P ml(-1) day(-1)), and produced IAA (14.9 μg ml(-1) day(-1)) in tryptophan amended media. Qualitative detection of siderophore production and HCN were possible at 15°C. At 4°C it retained all the plant growth promotion attributes. Seed bacterization with the isolate, positively influenced the growth and nutrient uptake parameters of wheat seedlings in glass house studies at suboptimal cold growing temperatures."

"23017837","abstracttext","Phytochelatin synthase (PCS) (EC 2.3.2.15) catalyzes the final step of phytochelatins (PCs) biosynthesis. PCs are a family of cysteine-rich thiol-reactive and heavy metal-binding peptides that play an important role in sequestration and detoxification of heavy metals in plants. Previous studies have indicated that plants that overexpressed PCS displayed contrasting phenotypes, ranging from enhanced cadmium (Cd) tolerance to Cd hypersensitivity in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, the wheat phytochelatin synthase gene, TaPCS1, was heteroexpressed in wild-type rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Zhonghua 11) to evaluate the relationship between synthesis of PCs and Cd tolerance in rice. Data showed that the heteroexpression of TaPCS1 in rice enhanced Cd sensitivity and significantly increased Cd accumulation in shoots, but not in roots. Additionally, the PCS line exhibited a much higher content of PCs and non-protein thiols (NPTs) in shoots. Prominent changes in NPT composition led to reduced glutathione pool depletion and higher Cd content in cell organelles in shoots, followed by higher oxidative stress, which might result in Cd sensitivity. Therefore, the heteroexpression of TaPCS1 in rice is capable of increasing Cd accumulation in rice shoots and enhancing Cd sensitivity."

In addition to the rats of low-fat diet group, others animals were exposed to a high-fat/cholesterol diet condition for 8 weeks. The city diet (CD) is based on the diet consumed by urban residents in modern China, which is rich in fat/cholesterol and high in carbohydrates from white rice and processed wheat starch. The chief source of dietary carbohydrates of wild rice diet (WRD) is from Chinese wild rice and other compositions are the same with CD. Rats fed CD showed elevated body and liver organ weights, lipid profiles, free fatty acids (FFA) and leptin comparable with rats fed high-fat/cholesterol diet (HFD) known to induce obesity and hyperlipidaemia in this species. However, rats consuming WRD suppressed the increase of lipid droplets accumulation, FFA, and leptin, and the decrease of lipoprotein lipase and adipose triglyceride lipase. Meanwhile, WRD prevented high-fat/cholesterol diet-induced elevation in protein expression of sterol-regulatory element binding protein-1c, and gene expression of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase. These findings indicate that wild rice as a natural food has the potentials of preventing obesity and liver lipotoxicity induced by a high-fat/cholesterol diet in rats."

"23052022","abstracttext","Selective phenotyping is a way of capturing the benefits of large population sizes without the need to carry out large-scale phenotyping and hence is a cost-effective means of capturing information about gene-trait relationships within a population. The diversity within the sample gives an indication of the efficiency of this information capture; less diversity implies greater redundancy of the genetic information. Here, we propose a method to maximize genetic diversity within the selected samples. Our method is applicable to general experimental designs and robust to common problems such as missing data and dominant markers. In particular, we discuss its application to multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations, where, although thousands of lines may be genotyped as a large population resource, only hundreds may need to be phenotyped for individual studies. Through simulation, we compare our method to simple random sampling and the minimum moment aberration method. While the gain in power over simple random sampling for all tested methods is not large, our method results in a much more diverse sample of genotypes. This diversity can be applied to improve fine mapping resolution once a QTL region has been detected. Further, when applied to two wheat datasets from doubled haploid and MAGIC progeny, our method detects known QTL for small sample sizes where other methods fail."

The most bioactive strain CDW7 was identified as Chaetomium globosum by microscopic examination and ITS rRNA gene sequence data. Culture broth of CDW7 diluted 3-fold completely inhibited the mycelial growth and conidia germination of F. graminearum in vitro. Therefore, Fusarium head blight, a common disease in wheat and barley associated with Fusarium spp., was used to test the anti-phytopathogenic activity in vivo.

"23213200","abstracttext","Legumes were among the first plant species to be domesticated, and accompanied cereals in expansion of agriculture from the Fertile Crescent into diverse environments across the Mediterranean basin, Europe, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. Although several recent studies have outlined the molecular basis for domestication and eco-geographic adaptation in the two main cereals from this region, wheat and barley, similar questions remain largely unexplored in their legume counterparts. Here we identify two major loci controlling differences in photoperiod response between wild and domesticated pea, and show that one of these, high response to photoperiod (HR), is an ortholog of early flowering 3 (ELF3), a gene involved in circadian clock function. We found that a significant proportion of flowering time variation in global pea germplasm is controlled by HR, with a single, widespread functional variant conferring altered circadian rhythms and the reduced photoperiod response associated with the spring habit. We also present evidence that ELF3 has a similar role in lentil, another major legume crop, with a distinct functional variant contributing to reduced photoperiod response in cultivars widely deployed in short-season environments. Our results identify the factor likely to have permitted the successful prehistoric expansion of legume cultivation to Northern Europe, and define a conserved genetic basis for major adaptive changes in flowering phenology and growth habit in an important crop group."

Here we review the pieces of evidence that support the role of aristolochic acid (AA) in inducing a mutational fingerprint in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 in urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract (UUT). Exposure to AA, a nitrophenathrene carboxylic acid present in certain herbal remedies and in flour prepared from wheat grain contaminated with seeds of Aristolochia clematitis, has been linked to chronic nephropathy and UUT. TP53 mutations in UUT of individuals exposed to AA reveal a unique pattern of mutations characterized by A to T transversions on the non-transcribed strand, which cluster at hotspots rarely mutated in other cancers. This unusual pattern, originally discovered in UUTs from two different populations, one in Taiwan, and one in the Balkans, has been reproduced experimentally by treating mouse cells that harbor human TP53 sequences with AA. The convergence of molecular epidemiological and experimental data establishes a clear causal association between exposure to the human carcinogen AA and UUT. Despite bans on the sale of herbs containing AA, their use continues, raising global public health concern and an urgent need to identify populations at risk."

"23356734","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA)-, stress-, and ripening-induced (ASR) proteins are reported to be involved in abiotic stresses. However, it is not known whether ASR genes confer drought stress tolerance by utilizing the antioxidant system. In this study, a wheat ASR gene, TaASR1, was cloned and characterized. TaASR1 transcripts increased after treatments with PEG6000, ABA and H(2)O(2). Overexpression of TaASR1 in tobacco resulted in increased drought/osmotic tolerance, which was demonstrated that transgenic lines had lesser malondialdehyde (MDA), ion leakage (IL) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), but higher relative water content (RWC) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities than wild type (WT) under drought stress. Overexpression of TaASR1 in tobacco also enhanced the expression of ROS-related and stress-responsive genes under osmotic stress. In addition, transgenic lines exhibited improved tolerance to oxidative stress by retaining more effective antioxidant system. Finally, TaASR1 was localized in the cell nucleus and functioned as a transcriptional activator. Taken together, our results showed that TaASR1 functions as a positive factor under drought/osmotic stress, involved in the regulation of ROS homeostasis by activating antioxidant system and transcription of stress-associated genes."

"23630328","abstracttext","Environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, and cold are major adverse factors that significantly affect agricultural productivity. Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation is a major signalling event induced by osmotic stress in higher plants. Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) family members play essential roles in the response to hyperosmotic stresses in plants. In this study, the TaSnRK2.3 gene, a novel SnRK2 member was cloned, and three copies located on chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D were identified in common wheat. TaSnRK2.3 was strongly expressed in leaves, and responded to polyethylene glycol, NaCl, abscisic acid, and cold stresses. To characterize its function, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaSnRK2.3-GFP controlled by the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter was generated and subjected to severe abiotic stresses. Overexpression of TaSnRK2.3 resulted in an improved root system and significantly enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses, simultaneously demonstrated by enhanced expression of abiotic stress-responsive genes and ameliorative physiological indices, including a decreased rate of water loss, enhanced cell membrane stability, improved photosynthetic potential, and significantly increased osmotic potential and free proline content under normal and/or stressed conditions. These results demonstrate that TaSnRK2.3 is a multifunctional regulator, with potential for utilization in transgenic breeding for improved abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants."

"23888156","abstracttext","The yellow dwarf viruses (YDVs) of the Luteoviridae family represent the most widespread group of cereal viruses worldwide. They include the Barley yellow dwarf viruses (BYDVs) of genus Luteovirus, the Cereal yellow dwarf viruses (CYDVs) and Wheat yellow dwarf virus (WYDV) of genus Polerovirus. All of these viruses are obligately aphid transmitted and phloem-limited. The first described YDVs (initially all called BYDV) were classified by their most efficient vector. One of these viruses, BYDV-RMV, is transmitted most efficiently by the corn leaf aphid, Rhopalosiphum maidis. Here we report the complete 5612 nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of a Montana isolate of BYDV-RMV (isolate RMV MTFE87, Genbank accession no. KC921392). The sequence revealed that BYDV-RMV is a polerovirus, but it is quite distantly related to the CYDVs or WYDV, which are very closely related to each other. Nor is BYDV-RMV closely related to any other particular polerovirus. Depending on the gene that is compared, different poleroviruses (none of them a YDV) share the most sequence similarity to BYDV-RMV. Because of its distant relationship to other YDVs, and because it commonly infects maize via its vector, R. maidis, we propose that BYDV-RMV be renamed Maize yellow dwarf virus-RMV (MYDV-RMV)."

"23819608","abstracttext_results","Three categories of Lr34 mutants were identified that were either partial susceptible, fully susceptible or hyper-susceptible to stripe rust and leaf rust. The likely impact of the mutational change on the predicted Lr34 protein correlated with differences in response to rust infection. Four independent Lr67 mutants were recovered that were susceptible to stripe rust, leaf rust and stem rust pathogens, including one possible hyper-susceptible Lr67 mutant."
"23819608","abstracttext_conclusions","Detailed study of Lr34 mutants revealed that subtle changes in resistance response to multiple pathogens were correlated with mutational changes in the predicted protein. Recovery of independent Lr67 mutants indicates that as for Lr34, a single gene at the Lr67 locus is likely to confer resistance to multiple pathogens. The infection phenotypes of Lr67 mutants closely resembled that of Lr34 mutants."
"23078349","articletitle","Aflatoxins, fumonisins, and trichothecenes: a convergence of knowledge."
"23078349","abstracttext","Plant pathogenic fungi Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium verticillioides, and Fusarium graminearum infect seeds of the most important food and feed crops, including maize, wheat, and barley. More importantly, these fungi produce aflatoxins, fumonisins, and trichothecenes, respectively, which threaten health and food security worldwide. In this review, we examine the molecular mechanisms and environmental factors that regulate mycotoxin biosynthesis in each fungus, and discuss the similarities and differences in the collective body of knowledge. Whole-genome sequences are available for these fungi, providing reference databases for genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses. It is well recognized that genes responsible for mycotoxin biosynthesis are organized in clusters. However, recent research has documented the intricate transcriptional and epigenetic regulation that affects these gene clusters. Significantly, molecular networks that respond to environmental factors, namely nitrogen, carbon, and pH, are connected to components regulating mycotoxin production. Furthermore, the developmental status of seeds and specific tissue types exert conditional influences during fungal colonization. A comparison of the three distinct mycotoxin groups provides insight into new areas for research collaborations that will lead to innovative strategies to control mycotoxin contamination of grain."

"23462884","abstracttext","TaSAP1, a member of the stress association protein (SAP) gene family from wheat, is involved in response to several abiotic stresses, including drought, salt and cold. In this study, TaSAP1-A1, a TaSAP1 member on chromosome 7A, and its flanking sequences were isolated. Polymorphism analysis indicated that the average nucleotide diversity (π) of the whole region was 0.00296. The highest nucleotide diversity occurred in the promoter region (π = 0.00631) and no polymorphism was identified in the coding region. Three markers T7AM5, T7AM2606 and T7AM39 located in the promoter region, were developed from sequence variations (InDel5-1810, SNP-2606 and InDel39-1637). Six haplotypes were identified among 300 accessions based on the three markers. TaSAP1-A1 was located on chromosome 7A using marker T7AM39 and was flanked by markers Xwmc530 and Xbarc174. QTL for yield-related traits, including 1,000-grain weight, number of grains per spike and grain yield, were located in the same region. In marker- and haplotype-trait association analyses, TaSAP1-A1 was significantly associated with 1,000-grain weight, number of grains per spike, spike length, peduncle length and total number of spikelets per spike in multiple environments. These results provide useful information for marker-assisted selection for yield-related traits under well-watered and drought-stressed conditions."

"24742831","abstracttext","The fungus Clonostachys rosea is antagonistic against plant pathogens, including Fusarium graminearum, which produces the oestrogenic mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA). ZEA inhibits other fungi, and C. rosea can detoxify ZEA through the enzyme zearalenone lactonohydrolase (ZHD101). As the relevance of ZEA detoxification for biocontrol is unknown, we studied regulation and function of ZHD101 in C. rosea. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR revealed zhd101 gene expression in all conditions studied and demonstrated dose-dependent induction by ZEA. Known inducers of the Polyketide Synthase pathway did not induce zhd101 expression, suggesting specificity of the enzyme towards ZEA. To assess the role of ZHD101 during biocontrol interactions, we generated two Δzhd101 mutants incapable of ZEA-detoxification and confirmed their defect in degrading ZEA by HPLC. The Δzhd101 mutants displayed a lower in vitro ability to inhibit growth of the ZEA-producing F. graminearum (strain 1104-14) compared to the wild type. In contrast, all three C. rosea strains equally inhibited growth of the F. graminearum mutant (ΔPKS4), which is impaired in ZEA-production. Furthermore, the Δzhd101 mutants failed to protect wheat seedlings against foot rot caused by the ZEA-producing F. graminearum. These data show that ZEA detoxification by ZHD101 is important for the biocontrol ability of C. rosea against F. graminearum."

The enzyme consisted of a single catalytic domain, which is 74% identical to that of an endo-β-1,4-xylanase (GH10) from Isoptericola variabilis 225. Unlike other endo-β- 1,4-xylanases from invertebrate-symbiotic bacteria, rXylH was an alkali-tolerant multifunctional enzyme possessing endo-β-1,4-xylanase activity together with β-1,3/β-1,4- glucanase activity, which exhibited its highest xylanolytic activity at pH 9.0 and 60°C, and was relatively stable within a broad pH range of 5.0-10.0. The susceptibilities of different xylosebased polysaccharides to the XylH were assessed to be as follows: oat spelts xylan > beechwood xylan > birchwood xylan > wheat arabinoxylan. rXylH was also able to readily cleave p-nitrophenyl (pNP) cellobioside and pNP-xylopyranoside, but did not hydrolyze other pNP-sugar derivatives, xylobiose, or hexose-based materials. Enzymatic hydrolysis of birchwood xylan resulted in the product composition of xylobiose (71.2%) and xylotriose (28.8%) as end products."

Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl and pinoxaden were observed failing to control American sloughgrass in the same filed in Lujiang county in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Whole-plant bioassay was conducted to determine the resistance to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl, pinoxaden and other herbicides in American sloughgrass. Dose-response experiment indicated that Lujiang population was highly resistant to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (199.8-fold), pinoxaden (76.2-fold), clodinafop-propargyl (334.1-fold) and sethoxydim (15.9-fold); moderately resistant to clethodim (6.3-fold), susceptible to mesosulfuron-methyl, flucarbazone-sodium, pyroxsulam and isoproturon. Partial gene of CT domain was cloned and sequenced to confirm the molecular mechanism of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides. A Trp2027Cys mutation was found in Lujiang population according to the sequencing result. This mutation is the molecular mechanism of resistance to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl in Lujiang population. Furthermore the Trp2027Cys mutation very likely results in cross resistance to clodinafop-propargyl and pinoxaden in Lujiang population. 103 mutant homozygotes were detected from the 108 plants tested using a rapid dCAPS method developed in this paper.

"24719312","abstracttext","Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxide produced in cell metabolism, result in the disruption of cellular function and structure. Catalase (CAT), an enzyme which exists in almost all organisms including plants, invertebrates and vertebrates, acts in scavenging ROS. In this study, a sequence fragment encoding a CAT-like protein from wheat aphids ( Sitobion avenae) was cloned. Amino acid sequence alignment showed this CAT shared relatively high conservation with CAT sequences from other insects. We detected cat mRNA levels at nymphs of different stages and adults and results showed that cat expression in adults was significantly higher compared to juvenile stages. At the third instar stage, ingestion of dsCAT significantly knocked down CAT expression. Continuous feeding of dsCAT mixed in an artificial diet led to reduced survival rate and ecdysis index. This study indicates that cat, a potential target gene for management of insect pests, is important for maintaining the survival of  S. avenae."

"24095774","abstracttext","To characterize aphid mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) features, we sequenced the complete mitogenome of the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia. The 15,784-bp mitogenome with a high A+T content (84.76%) and strong C skew (-0.26) was arranged in the same gene order as that of the ancestral insect. Unlike typical insect mitogenomes, D. noxia possessed a large tandem repeat region (644 bp) located between trnE and trnF. Sequencing partial mitogenome of the cotton aphid (Aphis gossypii) further confirmed the presence of the large repeat region in aphids, but with different repeat length and copy number. Another motif (58 bp) tandemly repeated 2.3 times in the control region of D. noxia. All repeat units in D. noxia could be folded into stem-loop secondary structures, which could further promote an increase in copy numbers. Characterization of the D. noxia mitogenome revealed distinct mitogenome architectures, thus advancing our understanding of insect mitogenomic diversities and evolution."
"24082821","articletitle","Understanding Molecular Mechanisms of Durable and Non-durable Resistance to Stripe Rust in Wheat Using a Transcriptomics Approach."
"24082821","abstracttext","Stripe rust of wheat, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, continues to cause severe damage worldwide. Durable resistance is necessary for sustainable control of the disease. High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance, which expresses when the weather becomes warm and plants grow older, has been demonstrated to be durable. We conducted numerous studies to understand the molecular mechanisms of different types of stripe rust resistance using a transcriptomics approach. Through comparing gene expression patterns with race-specific, all-stage resistance controlled by various genes, we found that a greater diversity of genes is involved in HTAP resistance than in all-stage resistance. The genes involved in HTAP resistance are induced more slowly and their expression induction is less dramatic than genes involved in all-stage resistance. The high diversity of genes and less dramatic induction may explain durability and the incomplete expression level of HTAP resistance. Identification of transcripts may be helpful in identifying resistance controlled by different genes and in selecting better combinations of genes to combine for achieving adequate and durable resistance."

One transformant, labeled as P. pastoris GSFaeA4-8, expressing the highest recombinant AuFaeA (reAuFaeA) activity of 10.76 U/ml was selected by the flask expression test. The expressed reAuFaeA was purified to homogeneity with an apparent molecular weight of 36.0 kDa by SDS-PAGE analysis, and characterized using the model substrate of methyl ferulate (MFA). The purified reAuFaeA was optimally active at pH 5.0 and 45 °C, and highly stable at pH 4.0-6.5 and 45 °C or below. Its activity was not significantly affected by metal ions tested and EDTA. The K m and V max of reAuFaeA towards MFA were 4.64 mM and 115.5 U/mg, respectively. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis showed that only 9.7 % of total alkali-extractable ferulic acid (FA) was released from destarched wheat bran by reAuFaeA alone. The released FA increased to 36.5 % when reAuFaeA was used together with a recombinant Aspergillus usamii GH family 11 xylanase A, indicating a synergistic interaction between them."

"24117691","abstracttext","The protein ApsB has been shown to play critical roles in the migration and positioning of nuclei and in the development of conidiophores in Aspergillus nidulans. The functions of ApsB in Fusarium graminearum, a causal agent of Fusarium head blight in China, are largely unknown. In this study, we used the blastp program at the Broad Institute to identify FgApsB, an F. graminearum homolog of A. nidulansApsB. The functions of FgApsB were evaluated by constructing a deletion mutant of FgApsB, designated ΔFgApsB-28. Conidiation and mycelial growth rate are reduced in ΔFgApsB-28. The hyphae of ΔFgApsB-28 are thinner than those of the wild type and have a different branching angle. ΔFgApsB-28 exhibited reduced aerial hyphae formation, but increased production of rubrofusarin. Whereas nuclei are evenly distributed in germ tubes and hyphae of the wild type, they are clustered and irregularly distributed in ΔFgApsB-28. The mutant exhibited increased resistance to cell wall-damaging agents, but reduced virulence on flowering wheat heads, which is consistent with its reduced production of the toxin deoxynivalenol. All of the defects in ΔFgApsB-28 were restored by genetic complementation with the parental FgApsB gene. Taken together, the results indicate that FgApsB is important for vegetative differentiation, asexual development, nuclear migration, and virulence in F. graminearum."

"23911295","abstracttext","Fourteen Sitobion avenae Fabricius (Hemiptera: Aphididae) clonal lines (clones) originating from China were tested for their ability to transmit BYDV-PAV (one isolate from Belgium and another from China) using wheat plants. By sequence analysis, the coat protein gene of BYDV-PAV-BE was distinguishable from BYDV-PAV-CN. All of the clones could transmit BYDV-PAV, and the transmission varied from 24.42% to 66.67% with BYDV-PAV-BE and from 23.55% to 56.18% with BYDV-PAV-CN. These data suggest that S. avenae has no specialty in BYDV-PAV isolate. Significant differences in the transmission frequencies between the clones with BYDV-PAV-BE and BYDV-PAV-CN were observed. The transmission efficiencies of aphid clones from the middle-lower reaches of Yangtze River (AH, HD, HDE, HZ, JZ, JY and SJ) and Yunnan province (YH) were similar. Nevertheless, differences in the virus transmission efficiencies of the clones from northern (ST and STA) and northwestern (QX, SB and XS) regions were assessed. The transmission efficiency of S. avenae from northern and northwestern China, where BYDV impact is more important, was higher than that from the middle-lower reaches of the Yangtze River and Yunnan province. This work emphasizes the importance of considering aphid vector clonal diversity in addition to virus strain variability when assessing BYDV transmission efficiency."
"23911633","articletitle","The CUG-initiated larger form coat protein of Chinese wheat mosaic virus binds to the cysteine-rich RNA silencing suppressor."
"23911633","abstracttext","Some viruses use alternative translation initiation at non-AUG codons as a strategy to produce multiple proteins during gene expression. Here we show that, using this strategy, Chinese wheat mosaic virus (CWMV; Furovirus) expresses a larger form of coat protein (N-ext/CP) in infected plants. Site-directed mutagenesis and transient expression analysis confirmed that CWMV N-ext/CP is initiated at an upstream in-frame CUG codon at nucleotide position 207-209 of RNA 2, which adds a 39 amino acid (aa) N-terminal extension to the major CP. Interestingly, in planta and in vitro analyses indicated that CWMV N-ext/CP but not CP interacts with the CWMV cysteine-rich protein (CRP), an RNA silencing suppressor. We further determined that the N-terminal 39 aa extension, particularly the 10 aa region immediately upstream of the major CP coding region is responsible for the interaction of N-ext/CP with CRP. In an Agrobacterium co-infiltration assay, co-expression with N-ext/CP did not affect CRP silencing suppression activity. Thus the alternative translation initiation at a CUG codon provides the CWMV N-ext/CP with the ability to bind to the viral silencing suppressor."

"24150273","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat. Here we report a 110-Mb draft sequence of Pst isolate CY32, obtained using a 'fosmid-to-fosmid' strategy, to better understand its race evolution and pathogenesis. The Pst genome is highly heterozygous and contains 25,288 protein-coding genes. Compared with non-obligate fungal pathogens, Pst has a more diverse gene composition and more genes encoding secreted proteins. Re-sequencing analysis indicates significant genetic variation among six isolates collected from different continents. Approximately 35% of SNPs are in the coding sequence regions, and half of them are non-synonymous. High genetic diversity in Pst suggests that sexual reproduction has an important role in the origin of different regional races. Our results show the effectiveness of the 'fosmid-to-fosmid' strategy for sequencing dikaryotic genomes and the feasibility of genome analysis to understand race evolution in Pst and other obligate pathogens."

Cytological analysis of 16 plants indicated that 15 were symmetric hybrids carrying 54 chromosomes, the sum of the parental chromosome numbers. One hybrid was asymmetric with 45 chromosomes. Nuclear hybridity of five putative hybrids was confirmed by the Southern hybridization pattern of full length 18s-25s wheat nuclear rDNA probe which revealed the presence of Hind III fragments characteristic of both the parental species. The hybridization pattern of mitochondria specific gene probe cox I indicated that three of the hybrids carried B. juncea mitochondria and one carried mitochondria of D. catholica. Presence of novel 3.5 kb Hind III and 4.8 kb Bgl II fragments suggested the occurrence of mtDNA recombination in one of the hybrids. The hybrids were pollen sterile.

It also contains relatively good quality of protein (about 3 to 6% of the dried weight) and patatin, and 11S globulin is a major storage protein with high level of lysine. However, tuber protein contains relatively low amounts of sulphur-containing amino acids, which may result in low nutritional value. Recently, we cloned a gene encoding PrLeg polypeptide, a seed storage protein from Perilla, which contains relatively higher levels of sulphur-containing amino acids. We transformed PrLeg cDNA into a potato plant to over-express under the direction of the tuber-specific promoter, patatin. Most of the transgenic lines identified through PCR and RT-PCR analyses were able to accumulate high amount of prLeg transcript in their tuber tissue, while very little or no transcript that were detected in their leaf tissues. The level of methionine content was elevated up to three-fold compared to non-transgenic parental line, without any significant changes in other amino acids, suggesting that further research is required to get a deeper insight into their nutritional value."

"24130823","abstracttext","Herbaspirillum seropedicae is a plant growth-promoting diazotrophic betaproteobacterium which associates with important crops, such as maize, wheat, rice and sugar-cane. We have previously reported that intact lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is required for H. seropedicae attachment and endophytic colonization of maize roots. In this study, we present evidence that the LPS biosynthesis gene waaL (codes for the O-antigen ligase) is induced during rhizosphere colonization by H. seropedicae. Furthermore a waaL mutant strain lacking the O-antigen portion of the LPS is severely impaired in colonization. Since N-acetyl glucosamine inhibits H. seropedicae attachment to maize roots, lectin-like proteins from maize roots (MRLs) were isolated and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis showed that MRL-1 and MRL-2 correspond to maize proteins with a jacalin-like lectin domain, while MRL-3 contains a B-chain lectin domain. These proteins showed agglutination activity against wild type H. seropedicae, but failed to agglutinate the waaL mutant strain. The agglutination reaction was severely diminished in the presence of N-acetyl glucosamine. Moreover addition of the MRL proteins as competitors in H. seropedicae attachment assays decreased 80-fold the adhesion of the wild type to maize roots. The results suggest that N-acetyl glucosamine residues of the LPS O-antigen bind to maize root lectins, an essential step for efficient bacterial attachment and colonization."

"24169787","abstracttext","WIS 2-1A, the first retrotransposon found in wheat, has been recently studied and characterized. Southern hybridization experiments utilizing several species from the Triticeae revealed the presence of homologous sequences in all the taxa tested, showing high levels of interspecific variability and almost no intraspecific differentiation. Further experiments using in situ hybridization in several species showed that the retroposon was almost completely dispersed throughout the genomes tested. These results suggested that WIS 2-1A is an ancient element that probably was present in the unknown common ancestor of the Triticeae and that only under rare circumstances does it become active. DNA fragments homologous to the WIS 2-1A reverse transcriptase gene were isolated from most of the Triticeae species using PCR. The fragments obtained were sequenced and analyzed. Even though the sequence alignment was consistent with the phylogenetic studies made in the past, the genus Thinopyrum showed new evidence for a possible horizontal propagation of the retroelement.Mention of a trade name or proprietary product does not constitute a guarantee, warranty or recommendation of the product by the U.S. Department of Agriculture or the University of Missouri and does not imply its approval to the exclusion of other products that may be suitableAll programs and services of the U.S. Department of Agriculture are offered on a non-discriminatory basis without regard to race, colour, national origin, religion, sex, age, marital status, or handicap."

Plate counts, carried out in three different media commonly used to detect food and sourdough LAB, revealed a maximal LAB concentration of approximately 4.75 Log CFU g(-1). Colonies representing various morphological appearances were isolated and differentiated based on phenotypic characteristics and genetic analysis by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR. Fifty unique strains were identified. Analysis by 16S rRNA gene sequencing grouped the strains into 11 LAB species, which belonged to six genera: Enterococcus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Pediococcus and Weissella. Weissella cibaria, Lactobacillus plantarum, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides and Leuconostoc citreum were the most prevalent species. The strains were not geographically related. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of total DNA of flour was used to provide a more complete understanding of the LAB population; it confirmed the presence of species identified with the culture-dependent approach, but did not reveal the presence of any additional LAB species. Finally, the technological characteristics (acidifying capacity, antimicrobial production, proteolytic activity, organic acid, and volatile organic compound generation) of the 50 LAB strains were investigated.

The 5'-flanking regions of the two corn H3 genes contain the classical histone-gene-specific consensus sequences and possess several regions of extensive nucleotide homology. A conserved octanucleotide 5'-CGCGGATC-3' occurs at approximately 200 nucleotides upstream from the initiation ATG codon. This octanucleotide was found to exist in all of the 7 plant histone genes sequenced so far. Codon usage is characterized by a very high frequency of C (67%) and G (28%) at the third position of the codons, those ending by A (1%) and T (4%) being practically excluded.Comparison of Southern blots of EcoRI, EcoRV and BamHI digested genomic DNA suggests that the corn H3 and H4 genes are not closely associated. The H3 genes exist as 60 to 80 copies and the H4 genes as 100 to 120 copies per diploid genome. re]19851002 rv]19851212 ac]19851216."

"24310196","abstracttext","The inheritance of avenin components, the prolamins (or alcohol soluble proteins) of Avena, is studied by means of gel electrophoresis. Avenin is composed of rather similar proteins which appear as a polymorphic group from a biochemical point of view. After a first preliminary investigation it showed a surprisingly high interspecific variability. The average number of its constituents increases with the ploidy level but it still is much lower than that of wheat gliadin.The avenin electrophoretic patterns of 47 samples (F4, F5 or F6 seeds) resulting from 3 hexaploid crosses are compared with the parental patterns. Four kinds of inheritance are observed. Roughly 50% of progeny profiles are identical to those of one of the parents. They are composed occasionally of partial sections of parental patterns. Complete additiveness occurs rather seldom. However, in one of the crosses a significant number of progeny samples show a band, one of the very slow moving constituents, which was not present in either of the parents.The study of avenin in F1 seeds, arising from reciprocal crosses between two homozygous parent plants, shows a significant effect of maternal gene dose in the triploid endosperm.Because of both the variability and the relatively small number of avenin constituents, these results show that typical endosperm proteins such as oat prolamin constitute a useful tool for phylogenetic studies of the genus Avena."

"24301340","abstracttext","The subunit composition of glutenin from 47 European wheat cultivars was studied using SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. These cultivars are genetically related since they originate from the same stock. Moreover, the diversity of sample, containing cultivars with very different French bread-making qualities, makes it possible to investigate the relationship between glutenin subunit composition and bread-making quality. 16 electrophoretic types of glutenin subunits could be distinguished: these were grouped into four classes. Depending on the cultivar, six to eight glutenin subunits with MW more than or equal to 62,000 were detected. Subunits 3 and 5, with an approximate MW of 122,000 and 108,000 respectively, seem to play a prominent role on bread-making quality; they were found in cultivars of good quality and were absent in those unsuitable for making French bread. Two other subunits (9 and 10; MW: 71,000 and 66,000, respectively) have a less defined influence but may be needed in some types of glutenin structure. Aneuploid analysis shows that in 'Chinese Spring', subunit 5 is coded by a gene on the long arm of chromosome 1B. The location of genes coding for subunits 3, 9 and 10 could not be determined."

"24302859","abstracttext","The genetic diversity among 31 putative Azotobacter isolates obtained from agricultural and non-agricultural soils was assessed using rep-PCR genomic fingerprinting and identified to species level by ARDRA and partial 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. High diversity was found among the isolates, identified as A. chroococcum, A. salinestris, and A. armeniacus. Selected isolates were characterized on the basis of phytohormone biosynthesis, nitrogenase activity, siderophore production, and phosphate solubilization. Indole-3 acetic-acid (IAA), gibberellin (GA3) and zeatin (Z) biosynthesis, nitrogenase activity, and siderophore production were found in all evaluated strains, with variation among them, but no phosphate solubilization was detected. Phytohormones excreted to the culture medium ranged in the following concentrations: 2.2-18.2 μ g IAA mL(-1), 0.3-0.7 μ g GA3 mL(-1), and 0.5-1.2 μ g Z mL(-1). Seed inoculations with further selected Azotobacter strains and treatments with their cell-free cultures increased the number of seminal roots and root hairs in wheat seedlings. This latter effect was mimicked by treatments with IAA-pure solutions, but it was not related to bacterial root colonization. Our survey constitutes a first approach to the knowledge of Azotobacter species inhabiting Argentinean soils in three contrasting geographical regions. Moreover, this phenotypic characterization constitutes an important contribution to the selection of Azotobacter strains for biofertilizer formulations."

"24302986","abstracttext","The grass tribe Triticeae (=Hordeeae) comprises only about 300 species, but it is well known for the economically important crop plants wheat, barley, and rye. The group is also recognized as a fascinating example of evolutionary complexity, with a history shaped by numerous events of auto- and allopolyploidy and apparent introgression involving diploids and polyploids. The genus Elymus comprises a heterogeneous collection of allopolyploid genome combinations, all of which include at least one set of homoeologs, designated St, derived from Pseudoroegneria. The current analysis includes a geographically and genomically diverse collection of 21 tetraploid Elymus species, and a single hexaploid species. Diploid and polyploid relationships were estimated using four molecular data sets, including one that combines two regions of the chloroplast genome, and three from unlinked nuclear genes: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, β-amylase, and granule-bound starch synthase I. Four gene trees were generated using maximum likelihood, and the phylogenetic placement of the polyploid sequences reveals extensive reticulation beyond allopolyploidy alone. The trees were interpreted with reference to numerous phenomena known to complicate allopolyploid phylogenies, and introgression was identified as a major factor in their history. The work illustrates the interpretation of complicated phylogenetic results through the sequential consideration of numerous possible explanations, and the results highlight the value of careful inspection of multiple independent molecular phylogenetic estimates, with particular focus on the differences among them."

"24341593","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici causes the major fungal wheat disease septoria tritici blotch, and is increasingly being used as a model for transmission and population genetics, as well as host-pathogen interactions. Here, we study the biological function of ZtWor1, the orthologue of Wor1 in the fungal human pathogen Candida albicans, as a representative of a superfamily of regulatory proteins involved in dimorphic switching. In Z. tritici, this gene is pivotal for pathogenesis, as ZtWor1 mutants were nonpathogenic and complementation restored the wild-type phenotypes. In planta expression analyses showed that ZtWor1 is up-regulated during the initiation of colonization and fructification, and regulates candidate effector genes, including one that was discovered after comparative proteome analysis of the Z. tritici wild-type strain and the ZtWor1 mutant, which was particularly expressed in planta. Cell fusion and anastomosis occur frequently in ZtWor1 mutants, reminiscent of mutants of MgGpb1, the β-subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. Comparative expression of ZtWor1 in knock-out strains of MgGpb1 and MgTpk2, the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A, suggests that ZtWor1 is downstream of the cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) pathway that is crucial for pathogenesis in many fungal plant pathogens."

"24416589","abstracttext","Seven xylanolytic bacterial strains were isolated from saw-dust dump soil. The bacterial strain X6 was selected on the basis of the highest xylanase activity with no cellulase contamination. It was identified as Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by biochemical tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach. Xylanase production studies by S. maltophilia on different commercial xylans and agro-industrial residues suggested that wheat bran was the best carbon source for xylanase production (26.4 ± 0.6 IU/mL). The studies with inorganic and organic nitrogen sources suggested yeast extract as the best support for xylanase production (25 ± 0.6 IU/mL). Maximum xylanase production was observed at initial medium pH = 8.0 (23.8 ± 0.4 IU/mL) with production at pH = 7.0 and pH = 9.0 being almost comparable. Xylanase produced by S. maltophilia was purified to homogeneity using ammonium sulfate precipitation, gel filtration, and ion exchange chromatography. The final purification was 5.43-fold with recovery of 19.18%. The molecular weight of the purified xylanase protein was ~142 kDa. Both crude and purified xylanase had good stability at pH = 9.0 and 80°C with activity retention greater than 90% after 30 min incubation. The enzyme stability at high temperature and alkaline pH make it potentially effective for industrial applications."

Biocatalytical production using engineered yeast expressing the HvUGT14077 gene allowed structural elucidation of this compound. The purified zearalenone-16-O-β-glucoside was used as an analytical calibrant in zearalenone metabolization experiments. This study confirmed the formation of this new masked mycotoxin in barley seedlings as well as in wheat and Brachypodium distachyon cell suspension cultures. In barley roots, up to 18-fold higher levels of zearalenone-16-O-β-glucoside compared to the known zearalenone-14-O-β-glucoside were found. Incubation of zearalenone-16-O-β-glucoside with human fecal slurry showed that this conjugate can also be hydrolyzed rapidly by intestinal bacteria, converting the glucoside back to the parental mycotoxin. Consequently, it should be considered as an additional masked form of zearalenone with potential relevance for food safety."

SDS-PAGE analysis of the recombinant CtCBM6A showed molecular size of approximately 15 kDa. Ligand-binding analysis of CtCBM6A with rye arabinoxylan and oat spelt xylan by affinity gel electrophoresis showed low affinity for these ligands (Ka of 40 and 26 liter/g, respectively), and analysis by fluorescence spectroscopy (Ka of 33 and 15 liter/g, respectively) corroborated lower binding affinity with the above soluble ligands. However, CtCBM6A displayed significantly higher ligand-binding affinity with insoluble wheat arabinoxylan with equilibrium association constant Ka of 230 M(-1) and binding capacity (N0) of 11 µmole/g. The protein melting curve of CtCBM6A displayed a peak shift from 53 to 58°C in the presence of Ca2+, indicating that Ca2+ imparts thermal stability to the CtCBM6A structure. Homology modeling of CtCBM6A revealed a characteristic β-sandwich core structure. The Ramachandran plot of CtCBM6A showed 89% of the residues in the most favorable region, 10% in additionally favored region, and 1% in generously allowed region, indicating that CtCBM6A has a stable conformation."

"24247346","abstracttext","The relative efficiences of the biparental mating systems and selfing series in connection with phenotypic and geno-phenotypic selection procedures were evaluated for yield improvement in a cross 'HP1102' X 'CPAN 1681' of wheat. Two selection cycles having a 4 per cent selection intensity for grain yield were carried out following both selection procedures under the two mating systems. Following these selection procedures, a greater improvement for grain yield could be achieved with the biparental mating system than with the selfing series. During the first selection cycle, the geno-phenotypic selection procedure had an edge over phenotypic selection procedure. The realized response due to the second cycle of selection and the predicted response for the third selection cycle indicated that the phenotypic selection procedure is more efficient than the geno-phenotypic selection procedure. It is suggested that selection following intermating in early segregating generations is able to overcome several inherent limitations of the simple pedigree method as it is possible to increase genetic variation and to concentrate favourable genes and gene combinations for grain yield. An increase in grain yield was, in general, accompanied by an increase in plant height, peduncle length, 100 grain weight, tiller number and biological yield. Therefore, it is suggested that an index comprised of grain yield, plant height, tiller number, grain weight and biological yield could be used for selecting high yielding genotypes of suitable height."

Seven selections with recombinations involving the foreign, translocated segment were recovered. Four of these had white endosperms and were leaf-rust resistant. The remaining lines were leaf-rust resistant and had levels of endosperm pigmentation intermediate to those of 'Indis' and 'Chinese Spring'. The recombined translocation segments coding for white endosperm are no longer associated with chromosome 7D. The original translocated segment may, therefore, not be fully homoeologous to 7DL. The recombinants with white endosperm also lack the stem-rust resitance gene Sr25, but retained the segregation distorter locus, Sd-1. However, it seems as though an enhancer locus (or loci) of Sd-1 had been lost."

The locations of the previously reported β-Amy-1 loci on chromosome arms 4Aβ (β-Amy-A1) and 4DL (β-Amy-D1) were confirmed and another set, β-Amy-2, was found on the group 5 chromosomes. A locus on 5AL (β-Amy-A1) was identified by nullisomic analysis and another on chromosome 5B (β-Amy-B2) was identified by analysis of inter-varietal chromosome substitution lines. The loci are complex, each coding for several isozymes, and allelic variation occurs at all four. Two alleles were identified at β-Amy-A1, five at β-Amy-D1, five at β-Amy-A2 and two at β-Amy-B2. Eleven different β-AMY phenotypes were distinguished amongst the 46 wheat varieties screened. The β-Amy-A2 locus was mapped by employing chromosome 5A recombinant lines and found to be closely linked and proximal to the awn inhibitor, B1, on the long arm. An attempt to map the β-Amy-D1 locus on chromosome 4D showed the gene to be located in the distal region of the long arm."

"24264867","abstracttext","Ten pairs of reciprocal crosses have been made between wheat cultivars which show differences in their glutenin subunit compositions. The F1 seed glutenin subunit composition was studied by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS). The results indicate that all the high molecular weight (HMW) and medium molecular weight (MMW) subunits (from 133,000 to 65,000 daltons) are transmitted to the F1 seed generation from the parental cultivars. In accordance with the triploid nature of the heterozygous endosperm (3n) and with the maternal and paternal gene dosage ratio (2∶1) in the endosperm itself, a significant effect of maternal parent is registered when comparing pairs of reciprocal seeds. Genes coding for the glutenin subunits are expressed whatever their doses are (one, two, or three) in the hybrid endosperm; thus the glutenin subunits inheritance is consistent with the co-dominant type.For one pair of the reciprocal crosses, two MMW parental bands (MW: 71,000 and 66,000) seemed absent in the F1 seed patterns while a new band with an intermediate, apparent MW (68,000) appears. This phenomenon was observed when the glutenins analyzed by electrophoresis were previously separated from other endosperm proteins, and not when they were directly extracted from the ground seed. We assume that the extraction can cause interactions between moieties attached to the subunits and lead to the formation of a complex having an intermediate electrophoretic mobility."

"24265684","abstracttext","A reverse genetics approach was used to investigate the role of γ-aminobutyric acid metabolism in the wheat pathogenic fungus Stagonospora nodorum. The creation of mutants lacking Sdh1, the gene encoding succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase, resulted in strains that grew poorly on γ-aminobutyric acid as a nitrogen source. The sdh1 mutants were more susceptible to reactive oxygen stress but were less affected by increased growth temperatures. Pathogenicity assays revealed that the metabolism of γ-aminobutyric acid is required for complete pathogenicity. Growth assays of the wild-type and mutant strains showed that the inclusion of γ-aminobutyric acid as a supplement in minimal media (i.e., not as a nitrogen or carbon source) resulted in restricted growth but increased sporulation. The addition of glutamate, the precursor to GABA, had no effect on either growth or sporulation. The γ-aminobutyric acid effect on sporulation was found to be dose dependent and not restricted to Stagonospora nodorum with a similar effect observed in the dothideomycete Botryosphaeria sp. The positive effect on sporulation was assayed using isomers of γ-aminobutyric acid and other metabolites known to influence asexual development in Stagonospora nodorum but no effect was observed. These data demonstrate that γ-aminobutyric acid plays an important role in Stagonospora nodorum in responding to environmental stresses while also having a positive effect on asexual development."

It was found that five disomic chromosome addition lines could be distinguished from one another and from the other two possible lines on the basis of the zymogram phenotypes of these isozymes.

"24237664","abstracttext","Fusarium verticillioides produces fumonisin mycotoxins during colonization of maize. Currently, molecular mechanisms underlying responsiveness of F.verticillioides to extracellular cues during pathogenesis are poorly understood. In this study, insertional mutants were created and screened to identify genes involved in responses to extracellular starch. In one mutant, the restriction enzyme-mediated integration cassette disrupted a gene (UBL1) encoding a UBR-Box/RING domain E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in the N-end rule pathway. Disruption of UBL1 in F.verticillioides (Δubl1) influenced conidiation, hyphal morphology, pigmentation and amylolysis. Disruption of UBL1 also impaired kernel colonization, but the ratio of fumonisin B1 per unit growth was not significantly reduced. The inability of a Δubl1 mutant to recognize an N-end rule degron confirmed involvement of UBL1 in the N-end rule pathway. Additionally, Ubl1 physically interacted with two G protein α subunits of F.verticillioides, thus implicating UBL1 in G protein-mediated sensing of the external environment. Furthermore, deletion of the UBL1 orthologue in F.graminearum reduced virulence on wheat and maize, thus indicating that UBL1 has a broader role in virulence among Fusarium species. This study provides the first linkage between the N-end rule pathway and fungal pathogenesis, and illustrates a new mechanism through which fungi respond to the external environment."

"24227149","abstracttext","Wheat genotypes, including backcross derivatives of 'Thatcher' carrying Lr10 and Lr23, substitution lines for Lr10 and Lr23 in Chinese Spring background and Chinese Spring and Thatcher were analysed against 21 pathotypes of leaf rust in seedling tests. Adult plant responses in all these stocks were observed in the field nurseries under exposure to the inoculum of the Indian virulent races of leaf rust. The seedling data demonstrated that both the substitution lines and the backcross derivatives for each gene carry identical pattern of infection for resistance. The high level of adult plant resistance in the substitution lines, in contrast to the backcross derivatives in Thatcher, has been postulated to be due to the combination of resistance contributed by Lr10 and adult plant Chinese Spring resistance or to Lr23 and Chinese Spring adult plant resistance. It has been suggested that genes Lr10 and Lr23 added to the Chinese Spring background provide sources for durable resistance, since Chinese Spring has continued to provide a moderate level of adult plant resistance to leaf rust for a very long time."

"24955427","abstracttext","The negative relationship between the yield potential of a genotype and its competitive ability may constitute an obstacle to recognize outstanding genotypes within heterogeneous populations. This issue was investigated by growing six heterogeneous wheat landraces along with a pure-line commercial cultivar under both dense and widely spaced conditions. The performance of two landraces showed a perfect match to the above relationship. Although they lagged behind the cultivar by 64 and 38% at the dense stand, the reverse was true with spaced plants where they succeeded in out-yielding the cultivar by 58 and 73%, respectively. It was concluded that dense stand might undervalue a landrace as potential gene pool in order to apply single-plant selection targeting pure-line cultivars, attributable to inability of plants representing high yielding genotypes to exhibit their capacity due to competitive disadvantage. On the other side, the yield expression of individuals is optimized when density is low enough to preclude interplant competition. Therefore, the latter condition appears ideal to identify the most promising landrace for breeding and subsequently recognize the individuals representing the most outstanding genotypes."
"24578593","articletitle","Functional analysis of TaABF1 during abscisic acid and gibberellin signalling in aleurone cells of cereal grains."
"24578593","abstracttext","The wheat transcription factor TaABF1 physically interacts with the protein kinase PKABA1 and mediates both abscisic acid (ABA)-induced and ABA-suppressed gene expression. In bombarded aleurone cells of imbibing grains, the effect of TaABF1 in down-regulating the gibberellin (GA)-induced Amy32b promoter was stronger in the presence of exogenous ABA. As these grains contained low levels of endogenous ABA, the effect of TaABF1 may also be mediated by ABA-induced activation even in the absence of exogenous ABA. Levels of TaABF1 protein decreased slightly during imbibition of afterripened grains. However, TaABF1 levels (especially in aleurone layers) were not substantially affected by exogenous ABA or GA, indicating that changes in TaABF1 protein level are not an important part of regulating its role in hormone signalling. We found that TaABF1 was phosphorylated in vivo in aleurone cells, suggesting a role for post-translational modification in regulating TaABF1 activity. Induction of Amy32b by overexpression of the transcription factor GAMyb could not be prevented by TaABF1, indicating that TaABF1 acts upstream of GAMyb transcription in the signalling pathway. Supporting this view, knockdown of TaABF1 by RNA interference resulted in increased expression from the GAMyb promoter. These results are consistent with a model in which TaABF1 is constitutively present in aleurone cells, while its ability to down-regulate GAMyb is regulated in response to ABA."

"24929734","abstracttext","This study aimed to determine whether glutamine deamidation improves acid resistance of Lactobacillus reuteri, and to assess whether arginine, glutamine, and glutamate-mediated acid resistance are redundant or complementary mechanisms of acid resistance. Three putative glutaminase genes, gls1, gls2, and gls3, were identified in L. reuteri 100-23. All three genes were expressed during growth in mMRS and wheat sourdough. L. reuteri consistently over-expressed gls3 and the glutamate decarboxylase gadB. L. reuteri 100-23ΔgadB over-expressed gls3 and the arginine deiminase gene adi. Analysis of the survival of L. reuteri in acidic conditions revealed that arginine conversion is effective at pH of 3.5 while glutamine or glutamate conversion were effective at pH of 2.5. Arginine conversion increased the pHin but not ΔΨ; glutamate decarboxylation had only a minor effect on the pHin but increased the ΔΨ. This study demonstrates that glutamine deamidation increases the acid resistance of L. reuteri independent of glutamate decarboxylase activity. Arginine and glutamine/glutamate conversions confer resistance to lactate at pH of 3.5 and phosphate at pH of 2.5, respectively. Knowledge of L. reuteri's acid resistance improves the understanding of the adaptation of L. reuteri to intestinal ecosystems, and facilitates the selection of probiotic and starter cultures."

"25134726","abstracttext","Graphene oxide (GO) is widely used in various fields and is considered to be relatively biocompatible. Herein, ""indirect"" nanotoxicity is first defined as toxic amplification of toxicants or pollutants by nanomaterials. This work revealed that GO greatly amplifies the phytotoxicity of arsenic (As), a widespread contaminant, in wheat, for example, causing a decrease in biomass and root numbers and increasing oxidative stress, which are thought to be regulated by its metabolisms. Compared with As or GO alone, GO combined with As inhibited the metabolism of carbohydrates, enhanced amino acid and secondary metabolism and disrupted fatty acid metabolism and the urea cycle. GO also triggered damage to cellular structures and electrolyte leakage and enhanced the uptake of GO and As. Co-transport of GO-loading As and transformation of As(V) to high-toxicity As(III) by GO were observed. The generation of dimethylarsinate, produced from the detoxification of inorganic As, was inhibited by GO in plants. GO also regulated phosphate transporter gene expression and arsenate reductase activity to influence the uptake and transformation of As, respectively. Moreover, the above effects of GO were concentration dependent. Given the widespread exposure to As in agriculture, the indirect nanotoxicity of GO should be carefully considered in food safety."

"26337287","abstracttext","In a number of dimorphic and hemibiotrophic pathogens, cell cycle regulation has been shown to be important for morphological changes related to infectious growth or infection-related morphogenesis. However, the role of mitotic CDK kinase Cdc2, the key regulator of cell cycle, in pathogenic growth is not clear, because most fungal pathogens have a single CDC2 gene that is essential for cell cycle progression and viability. Interestingly, the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum has two CDC2 genes. Although CDC2A and CDC2B have redundant functions in vegetative growth and asexual production, only CDC2A is required for invasive growth and plant infection. In this study, we showed that Cdc2A and Cdc2B interacted with each other and may form homo- and heterodimers in vegetative hyphae. We also identified sequence and structural differences between Cdc2A and Cdc2B that may be related to their functional divergence. These results, together with earlier studies with cyclins, important for differentiation and infection in Candida albicans and Ustilago maydis, indicated that dimorphic and hemibiotrophic fungal pathogens may have stage-specific cyclin-CDK combinations or CDK targets during saprophytic and pathogenic growth."

"26273258","abstracttext","An indigenous bacterial strain capable of utilizing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid as the sole carbon and energy source was isolated from a soil used for grown wheat with a long-term history of herbicide use in Beijing, China. The strain BJ71 was identified as Cupriavidus campinensis based on its 16S rRNA sequence analysis and morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics. The degradation characteristics of strain BJ71 were evaluated. The optimal conditions for 2,4-D degradation were as follows: pH 7.0, 30 °C, 3% (v/v) inoculum size, and an initial 2,4-D concentration of 350 mg L(-1). Up to 99.57% of the 2,4-D was degraded under optimal conditions after 6 days of incubation. Strain BJ71 was also able to degrade quizalofop and fluroxypyr. This is the first report of a 2,4-D-degrader containing tfdA gene that can utilize these two herbicides. In a biodegradation experiment, 87.13% and 42.53% of 2,4-D (initial concentration, 350 mg kg(-1)) was degraded in non-sterile and sterilized soil inoculated with BJ71, respectively, after 14 days. The 2,4-D degradation was more rapid in a soil microcosm including BJ71 than in a soil microcosm without BJ71. These results indicate that strain BJ71 is a potential candidate for the bioremediation of soil contaminated with the herbicide 2,4-D."

"26248604","abstracttext","TRI6 is a positive regulator of the trichothecene gene cluster and the production of trichothecene mycotoxins [deoxynivalenol (DON)] and acetylated forms such as 15-Acetyl-DON) in the cereal pathogen Fusarium graminearum. As a global transcriptional regulator, TRI6 expression is modulated by nitrogen-limiting conditions, sources of nitrogen and carbon, pH and light. However, the mechanism by which these diverse environmental factors affect TRI6 expression remains underexplored. In our effort to understand how nutrients affect TRI6 regulation, comparative digital expression profiling was performed with a wild-type F. graminearum and a Δtri6 mutant strain, grown in nutrient-rich conditions. Analysis showed that TRI6 negatively regulates genes of the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolic pathway. Feeding studies with deletion mutants of MCC, encoding methylcrotonyl-CoA-carboxylase, one of the key enzymes of leucine metabolism, showed that addition of leucine specifically down-regulated TRI6 expression and reduced 15-ADON accumulation. Constitutive expression of TRI6 in the Δmcc mutant strain restored 15-ADON production. A combination of cellophane breach assays and pathogenicity experiments on wheat demonstrated that disrupting the leucine metabolic pathway significantly reduced disease. These findings suggest a complex interaction between one of the primary metabolic pathways with a global regulator of mycotoxin biosynthesis and virulence in F. graminearum."

"26355747","abstracttext","PIF-like transposable elements are members of the PIF/Harbinger superfamily of DNA transposons found in the genomes of many plants, animals, and fungi. The evolution of the gene that encodes the transposase responsible for mobilizing PIF-like elements has been studied in both plants and animals, but the elements' history in flowering plants remains poorly known. In this work, we describe the phylogenetic distribution and evolution of PIF-like elements in the genomes of 21 diploid species from the wheat tribe, Triticeae, and we present the first convincing evidence of horizontal transfer of PIF elements in plant genomes. A phylogenetic analysis of 240 PIF sequences based on the conserved region of the transposase domain revealed at least four main transposase lineages. Their complex evolutionary history can be best explained by a combination of vertical transmission with differential evolutionary success among lineages, and occasional horizontal transfer between phylogenetically distant Triticeae genera. In addition, we identified 127 potentially functional transposase sequences indicating possible recent activity of PIF."

Here, we report the design and validation of a unique genic-SNP genotyping chip for genetic and evolutionary studies as well as molecular breeding applications in rice. The chip incorporates 50,051 SNPs from 18,980 different genes spanning 12 rice chromosomes, including 3,710 single-copy (SC) genes conserved between wheat and rice, 14,959 SC genes unique to rice, 194 agronomically important cloned rice genes and 117 multi-copy rice genes. Assays with this chip showed high success rate and reproducibility because of the SC gene based array with no sequence redundancy and cross-hybridisation problems. The usefulness of the chip in genetic diversity and phylogenetic studies of cultivated and wild rice germplasm was demonstrated. Furthermore, its efficacy was validated for analysing background recovery in improved mega rice varieties with submergence tolerance developed through marker-assisted backcross breeding."

"26438315","abstracttext","The xylanase gene (xynA) of Bacillus licheniformis 9945A was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) using pET-22b(+) as an expression vector. The recombinant xylanase enzyme was purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation, followed by single-step immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography with a 57.58-fold purification having 138.2 U/mg specific activity and recovery of 70.08 %. Molecular weight of the purified xylanase, 23 kDa, was determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The enzyme was stable for up to 70 °C with a broad pH range of 4-9 pH units. The enzyme activity was increased in the presence of metal ions especially Ca(+2) and decreased in the presence of EDTA, indicating that the xylanase was a metalloenzyme. However, an addition of 1-4 % Tween 80, β-mercaptoethanol, and DTT resulted in the increase of enzyme activity by 51, 52, and 5 %, respectively. Organic solvents with a concentration of 10-40 % slightly decreased the enzyme activity. The xylanase enzyme possesses the ability of bioconversion of plant biomasses like wheat straw, rice straw, and sugarcane bagasse. Among the different tested biomasses, the highest saccharification percentage was observed with 1 % sugarcane bagasse after 72 h of incubation at 50 °C with 20 units of enzyme. The results suggest that recombinant xylanase can be used in the bioconversion of natural biomasses into simple sugars which could be further used for the production of biofuel."

In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of hormone-regulated genes in Brachypodium distachyon using RNA sequencing technology. Brachypodium distachyon seedlings were treated with eight phytohormones (auxin, cytokinine, brassinosteroid, gibberelline, abscisic acid, ethylene, jasmonate and salicylic acid) and two inhibitors, Brz220 (brassinosteroid biosynthesis inhibitor) and prohexadione (gibberelline biosynthesis inhibitor). The expressions of 1807 genes were regulated in a phytohormone-dependent manner. We compared the data with the phytohormone responses that have reported in rice. Transcriptional responses to hormones are conserved between Bracypodium and rice. Transcriptional regulation by brassinosteroid, gibberellin and ethylene was relatively weaker than those by other hormones. This is consistent with the data obtained from comprehensive analysis of hormone responses reported in Arabidopsis. Brachypodium and Arabidopsis also shared some common transcriptional responses to phytohormones. Alternatively, unique transcriptional responses to phytohormones were observed in Brachypodium. For example, the expressions of ACC synthase genes were up-regulated by auxin treatment in rice and Arabidopsis, but no orthologous ACC synthase gene was up-regulated in Brachypodium. Our results provide information useful to understand the diversity and similarity of hormone-regulated transcriptional responses between eudicots and monocots."

This review covers the platforms for exome sequencing, next generation sequencing technologies that have revolutionized exome sequencing and led toward development of third generation sequencing. Also discussed in this review are the uses of these sequencing technologies to improve wheat, rice and cotton yield and how these technologies are used in exploring the biodiversity of crops, providing better understanding of plant-host pathogen interaction and assessing the process of natural evolution in crops and it also covers how exome sequencing identifies the gene pool involved in symbiotic and other co-existential systems. Furthermore, we conclude how integration of other methodologies including whole genome sequencing, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics with plant exomics covers the areas which are left untouched with exomics alone and in the end how these integration will transform the future of crops."

"25462969","abstracttext","A cold-responsive wheat gene, WLT10, encodes a member of the cereal-specific low temperature-responsive/cold-responsive protein family, which contains a hydrophobic N-terminal 20 amino acid sequence that corresponds to signal peptides associated with extracellular trafficking. To verify the subcellular localization of WLT10 and the function of its putative signal peptide, we constructed three chimeric genes in which either the WLT10 signal peptide, a signal peptide with only 6 additional amino acids, or the full-length WLT10 polypeptide was fused to the N-terminus of green fluorescent protein (GFP). These fusion constructs were transiently introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. GFP signals were observed not only in the extracellular space (ECS) but also in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. The time course of GFP signal localization suggests the movement of WLT10 through the ER/Golgi pathway and into the ECS. Thus, WLT10 is a cold-responsive secreted protein, and its N-terminal 20 amino acid region is important for transport to the ECS."

In this study, we performed de novo transcriptome sequencing of grain aphid via Roche 454 GS-FLX pyrosequencing. A total of 1,106,696 reads were obtained and assembled into 32,277 unigenes, of which 25,389, 21,635, and 16,211 unigenes matched the Nt, Nr, and Swiss-Prot databases, respectively. Functional annotation of these unigenes revealed not only the presence of genes that encode the key components of RNAi machinery such as Dicer and Argonaute but also the genes encoding the TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP) and the SID-1 protein, which function in assisting the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) formation in microRNA (miRNA) pathway and mediating a systemic RNA interference (RNAi) effect though a cellular uptake mechanism. Furthermore, among a set of 66 unigenes selected for a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) artificial diet assay, four novel effective RNAi targets, which led to high mortality of aphids due to the down-regulation of the expression of the respective target gene, were identified. Moreover, the expansion of systemic RNAi effect in grain aphid was observed by adding the fluorescently labeled dsRNA in an artificial diet assay."

"25438786","abstracttext","The soilborne necrotrophic pathogens Rhizoctonia and Pythium infect a wide range of crops in the US and worldwide. These pathogens pose challenges to growers because the diseases they cause are not adequately controlled by fungicides, rotation or, for many hosts, natural genetic resistance. Although a combination of management practices are likely to be required for control of Rhizoctonia and Pythium, genetic resistance remains a key missing component. This review discusses the recent deployment of introduced genes and genome-based information for control of Rhizoctonia, with emphasis on three pathosystems: Rhizoctonia solani AG8 and wheat, R. solani AG1-IA and rice, and R. solani AG3 or AG4 and potato. Molecular mechanisms underlying disease suppression will be addressed, if appropriate. Although less is known about genes and factors suppressive to Pythium, pathogen genomics and biological control studies are providing useful leads to effectors and antifungal factors. Prospects for resistance to Rhizoctonia and Pythium spp. will continue to improve with growing knowledge of pathogenicity strategies, host defense gene action relative to the pathogen infection process, and the role of environmental factors on pathogen-host interactions."

"25438789","abstracttext","American chestnut (Castanea dentata) is a classic example of a native keystone species that was nearly eradicated by an introduced fungal pathogen. This report describes progress made toward producing a fully American chestnut tree with enhanced resistance to the blight fungus (Cryphonectria parasitica). The transgenic American chestnut 'Darling4,' produced through an Agrobacterium co-transformation procedure to express a wheat oxalate oxidase gene driven by the VspB vascular promoter, shows enhanced blight resistance at a level intermediate between susceptible American chestnut and resistant Chinese chestnut (Castanea mollissima). Enhanced resistance was identified first with a leaf-inoculation assay using young chestnuts grown indoors, and confirmed with traditional stem inoculations on 3- and 4-year-old field-grown trees. Pollen from 'Darling4' and other events was used to produce transgenic T1 seedlings, which also expressed the enhanced resistance trait in leaf assays. Outcrossed transgenic seedlings have several advantages over tissue-cultured plantlets, including increased genetic diversity and faster initial growth. This represents a major step toward the restoration of the majestic American chestnut."

"25069397","abstracttext","Cyanobacteria are prominent inhabitants of many agricultural soils, where they potentially contribute towards biological nitrogen fixation, help in phosphate solubilization and mineral release to improve soil fertility and crop productivity. However, beside naturally fertilizing and balancing mineral nutrition in the soil, many cyanobacteria are known to release various kinds of biologically active substances like proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, amino acids, polysaccharides and phytohormones that function as elicitor molecules to promote plant growth and help them to fight against biotic and abiotic stress. These metabolites produced by the cyanobacteria affect the gene expression of the host plants and thereby bring about qualitative and quantitative changes in the phytochemical composition of the plants. Experiments carried out with live inoculum or with the extracts of cyanobacterial strains on several plant species, such as rice, wheat, maize, cotton etc., have demonstrated the synthesis of signalling metabolites. Thus, in view of its beneficial effect, this paper reviews the role of cyanobacteria in triggering the growth and development of plants and hence its utilization in agriculture."

"25048023","abstracttext_key message","TaACO1 could catalyze ACC into ethylene in vitro. Constitutive expression of TaACO1 in Arabidopsis conferred salt sensitivity, and TaACO1 regulates salt stress mainly via the DREB1/CBF signal transduction pathway. Ethylene signaling plays essential roles in mediating plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, besides regulating plant growth and development. The roles of ethylene biosynthesis in abiotic stress, however, remain elusive. In this study, an aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate oxidase gene, TaACO1, affecting the terminal step in ethylene biosynthesis, was isolated from a salt-tolerant bread wheat introgression line Shanrong No. 3 (SR3) and its effect on salt-stress response was examined. Purified recombinant protein of TaACO1 heterogenously expressed in Escherchia coli could catalyze ACC into ethylene in vitro. TaACO1 transcripts were down-regulated by salt, drought, oxidative stress and ABA. TaACO1-transgenic plants conferred salt sensitivity as judged from the seed germination, cotyledon greening and the relative root growth under salt stress. Constitutive expression of TaACO1 in Arabidopsis increased AtMYB15 expression and suppressed the expression of stress-responsive genes AtRAB18, AtCBF1 and AtCBF3. These findings are helpful in understanding the roles of ethylene biosynthesis in plant salt-stress response."

"25083910","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is an important fungal plant pathogen that causes serious losses in cereal crop yields and mycotoxicoses in humans and livestock. In this study, we characterized an insertion mutant, Z39R9282, with pleiotropic defects in sexual development and virulence. We determined that the insertion occurred in a gene encoding an ortholog of yeast elongator complex protein 3 (ELP3). Deletion of elp3 led to significant defects in sexual and asexual development in F. graminearum. In the elp3 deletion mutant, the number of perithecia formed was reduced and maturation of perithecia was delayed. This mutant also produced morphologically abnormal ascospores and conidia. Histone acetylation in the elp3 deletion mutant was reduced compared with the wild type, which likely caused the developmental defects. Trichothecenes were not produced at detectable levels, and expression of trichothecene biosynthesis genes were significantly reduced in the elp3 deletion mutant. Infection of wheat heads revealed that the elp3 deletion mutant was unable to spread from inoculated florets to neighboring spikelets. Furthermore, the elp3 deletion mutant was more sensitive to oxidative stress than the wild type, and the expression of putative catalase genes was reduced. We demonstrate that elp3 functions in sexual and asexual development, virulence, and the oxidative stress response of F. graminearum by regulating the expression of genes involved in these various developmental processes."

"25040476","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat and barley. Deoxynivalenol (DON) produced by the pathogen is an important mycotoxins and virulence factor. Because oxidative burst is a common defense response and reactive oxygen species (ROS) induces DON production, in this study, we characterized functional relationships of three stress-related transcription factor genes FgAP1, FgATF1 and FgSKN7. Although all of them played a role in tolerance to oxidative stress, deletion of FgAP1 or FgATF1 had no significant effect on DON production. In contrast, Fgskn7 mutants were reduced in DON production and defective in H2 O2 -induced TRI gene expression. The Fgap1 mutant had no detectable phenotype other than increased sensitivity to H2 O2 and Fgap1 Fgatf1 and Fgap1 Fgskn7 mutants lacked additional or more severe phenotypes than the single mutants. The Fgatf1, but not Fgskn7, mutant was significantly reduced in virulence and delayed in ascospore release. The Fgskn7 Fgatf1 double mutant had more severe defects in growth, conidiation and virulence than the Fgatf1 or Fgskn7 mutant. Instead of producing four-celled ascospores, it formed eight small, single-celled ascospores in each ascus. Therefore, FgSKN7 and FgATF1 must have overlapping functions in intracellular ROS signalling for growth, development and pathogenesis in F. graminearum."

The homeostasis of histone acetylation is controlled by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) in different plant tissues and development stages. The vigorous knowledge of the function and co-factors about HATs (e.g. GCN5) and HDACs (e.g. HDA19, HDA6) has been obtained from model plant Arabidopsis. However, understanding individual role of other HATs and HDACs require more work, especially in the major food crops such as rice, maize and wheat. Many co-regulators have been recently identified to function as a component of HAT or HDAC complex in some specific developmental processes. The described findings show a distinctive and interesting epigenetic regulation network composed of HATs, HDACs and co-regulators playing crucial roles in the seed performance, flowering time, plant morphogenesis, plant response to stresses etc. In this review, we summarized the recent progresses and suggested the perspective of histone acetylation research, which might provide us a new window to understand the epigenetic code of plant development and to improve the crop production and quality."

Recombinant TaNF-YA10-1 was heterologously produced in Escherichia coli, and the purified protein successfully bound to the CCAAT motif in vitro. TaNF-YA10-1 was down-regulated by the imposition of salinity and abscisic acid (ABA). The constitutive expression of TaNF-YA10-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana significantly increased the plant's sensitivity to salinity and repressed its sensitivity to ABA as judged from the seed germination, cotyledon greening and the relative root growth. The transcription of stress-related genes AtRAB18, AtRD29B, AtABI5, AtCBF1 and AtCBF3 was downregulated in TaNF-YA10-1 overexpression transgenic plants.

"25353158","abstracttext","The accelerating pace of gene discovery, coupled with novel plant breeding technologies, provides tangible opportunities with which to engineer disease resistance into agricultural and horticultural crops. This is especially the case for potato, wheat, apple and banana, which are afflicted with fungal and bacterial diseases that impact significantly on each crop's economic viability. Yet public scepticism and burdensome regulatory systems remain the two primary obstacles preventing the translation of research discoveries into cultivars of agronomic value. In this perspective review, the potential to address these issues is explained, and specific opportunities arising from recent genomics-based initiatives are highlighted as clear examples of what can be achieved in respect of developing disease resistance in crop species. There is an urgent need to tackle the challenge of agrichemical dependency in current crop production systems, and, while engineering for disease resistance is possible, it is not the sole solution and should not be proclaimed as so. Instead, all systems must be given due consideration, with none dismissed in the absence of science-based support, thereby ensuring that future cropping systems have the necessary advantage over those pathogens that continue to inflict losses year after year."

"25320440","abstracttext","Two hundred and thirty-two bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizospheric soil of Populus euphratica which is the dominant tree living in extreme arid regions in northwest China. Some strains with plant growth-promoting bacteria related metabolic characteristics were able to promote drought resistance in plants after inoculation. Ten strains with the greatest effects increased the dry weight of wheat shoots from 0.5 to 34.4 %, and the surface area of the root systems from 12.56 to 212.17 % compared to the control after drought treatment whereas no obvious promoting effect was observed in normal water conditions. These 10 strains were identified to be of the genera Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Stenotrophomonas and Serratia by 16S rRNA (rrs) gene sequence alignment. Among these strains, Serratia sp. 1-9 and Pseudomonas sp. 5-23 were the two most effective strains. Both of them produced auxin and the production increased significantly when cultured under simulated drought conditions which are inferred to be the most plausible mechanism for their plant growth-promoting effect under drought stress."

"25151819","abstracttext","Septoria tritici blotch caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola is currently one of the most economically damaging diseases on wheat crops worldwide. Two hundred and sixty single-conidial isolates of this fungus were sampled in April 2012 in the Nord-Pas de Calais region (France). They have all been collected from 13 distinct plots in a single field. The corresponding isolates were then fingerprinted using 8 microsatellite markers in order to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of M. graminicola at the single field scale. The results revealed a high genotypic diversity within the collected population, with the detection of 83% of unique haplotypes among the isolates tested (clonal fraction = 17%). A high genic diversity was also found as indicated by the Nei's index value (0.50) and strong allele diversity obtained (number of alleles per locus ranged from 7 to 17, with an average of 10 alleles per locus). Further analyses showed a low population differentiation (G(ST) = 0.08) and a high gene flow (Nm = 5.64) between the 13 sampled plots. Our study suggests that sexual reproduction, by its frequency, plays a major role in the genetic diversification of M. graminicola at the field level and in the distribution and homogenization of this diversity in the field via wind-born ascospores."

"25409087","abstracttext","Fusarium avenaceum is a fungus commonly isolated from soil and associated with a wide range of host plants. We present here three genome sequences of F. avenaceum, one isolated from barley in Finland and two from spring and winter wheat in Canada. The sizes of the three genomes range from 41.6-43.1 MB, with 13217-13445 predicted protein-coding genes. Whole-genome analysis showed that the three genomes are highly syntenic, and share>95% gene orthologs. Comparative analysis to other sequenced Fusaria shows that F. avenaceum has a very large potential for producing secondary metabolites, with between 75 and 80 key enzymes belonging to the polyketide, non-ribosomal peptide, terpene, alkaloid and indole-diterpene synthase classes. In addition to known metabolites from F. avenaceum, fuscofusarin and JM-47 were detected for the first time in this species. Many protein families are expanded in F. avenaceum, such as transcription factors, and proteins involved in redox reactions and signal transduction, suggesting evolutionary adaptation to a diverse and cosmopolitan ecology. We found that 20% of all predicted proteins were considered to be secreted, supporting a life in the extracellular space during interaction with plant hosts."

"25925773","abstracttext","A feruloyl esterase (FAE) gene was isolated from a rumen microbial metagenome, cloned into E. coli, and expressed in active form. The enzyme (RuFae4) was classified as a Type D feruloyl esterase based on its action on synthetic substrates and ability to release diferulates. The RuFae4 alone released ferulic acid (FA) and diferulic acid (diFA) from wheat insoluble arabinoxylan (WIA) and other natural substrates. The diFA released was confirmed by mass spectrometry. A maximum of 205±5.7 µg FA and 0.84±0.1 µg diFA were released (37°C, pH 6.5, 2 hr) when a saturating amount of RuFae4 (23 nmole for 100 mg WIA) was used. These yields represent 48.3% of FA, and 6.6% of diFAs present in the WIA substrate. Addition of GH10 endoxylanase (EX) to RuFae4 both at 1 nmole concentrations increased the release of FA and diFAs by 17 and 10 fold, respectively. Addition of GH11 EX resulted in smaller increase in the amount of both FA and diFAs. Applying additive amount of the two enzymes did not lead to additive increase in the product yields, suggesting that it was primarily the GH10 enzyme contributing synergism to FA/diFA release in mixed reactions."

"26092452","abstracttext","In broiler chickens, feed additives, including prebiotics, are widely used to improve gut health and to stimulate performance. Xylo-oligosaccharides (XOS) are hydrolytic degradation products of arabinoxylans that can be fermented by the gut microbiota. In the current study, we aimed to analyze the prebiotic properties of XOS when added to the broiler diet. Administration of XOS to chickens, in addition to a wheat-rye-based diet, significantly improved the feed conversion ratio. XOS significantly increased villus length in the ileum. It also significantly increased numbers of lactobacilli in the colon and Clostridium cluster XIVa in the ceca. Moreover, the number of gene copies encoding the key bacterial enzyme for butyrate production, butyryl-coenzyme A (butyryl-CoA):acetate CoA transferase, was significantly increased in the ceca of chickens administered XOS. In this group of chickens, at the species level, Lactobacillus crispatus and Anaerostipes butyraticus were significantly increased in abundance in the colon and cecum, respectively. In vitro fermentation of XOS revealed cross-feeding between L. crispatus and A. butyraticus. Lactate, produced by L. crispatus during XOS fermentation, was utilized by the butyrate-producing Anaerostipes species. These data show the beneficial effects of XOS on broiler performance when added to the feed, which potentially can be explained by stimulation of butyrate-producing bacteria through cross-feeding of lactate and subsequent effects of butyrate on gastrointestinal function."

Good candidates are essential fungal proteins and their regulators. An efficient way to reveal the molecular environment of an essential protein is the search for interacting factors. Here, we establish three yeast two-hybrid libraries, covering yeast and hyphal stages of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. No detectable genomic DNA was present in any of the 3 libraries. Random amplification revealed that the libraries include cDNA fragments of up to 2000bp, suggesting that small-to-medium sized proteins are represented therein. Indeed, full-length cDNAs of five proteins were found in all libraries. The full-length cDNA of large chitin synthase gene mcs1 (5742bp with introns; 5568bp without introns) could not be amplified, but its 5' and 3' regions were represented, suggesting that even larger genes are covered in all libraries. Finally, we tested for the expected interaction of the autophagy proteins ZtAtg4 and ZtAtg8 in Z. tritici, and then used ZtAtg4 to screen one of the two-hybrid libraries. Indeed, we found ZtAtg8 as a positive interaction partner, confirming that interacting proteins can be identified. Thus, these molecular tools promise to be useful in identifying novel fungicide target proteins."

"26100264","abstracttext","The aim of our experiments was to investigate the effect of chromosome 5A on the thiol-dependent redox environment and on the transcription of cold- and vernalization-related genes during the vegetative/generative transition in crowns and leaves of wheat. Chinese Spring, a moderately freezing-tolerant variety, and its more and less tolerant substitution lines - [CS(Ch5A)] and [CS(Tsp5A)], respectively - with different combinations of vernalization alleles were compared. At low temperature, the amount of cystine and glutathione disulphide and the related redox potentials increased in the crowns but not in the leaves. In the crowns of the substitution lines, the concentration and redox state of thiols were different only at the vegetative and double ridge (start of the generative transition) stages. The expression of the vernalization-related VRN1 gene increased significantly during the transition both in the crowns and leaves. The transcription of the freezing tolerance-related CBF14, COR14b and COR39 genes markedly increased in both organs after 2 weeks at 4 °C when the seedlings were still in the vegetative stage. This increment was greater in CS(Ch5A) than in CS(Tsp5A). The Ch5A chromosome in CS genetic background enhanced the expression of CBF regulon even in the generative phase in crown that is the key organ for overwintering and freezing tolerance. At certain developmental stages, both the thiol and the transcript levels differed significantly in the two substitution lines."

"26083807","abstracttext","The transcription factor NUCLEAR FACTOR Y (NF-Y) plays an essential role in many developmental and stress-responsive processes in plants. NF-Y composed of 3 subunits, NF-YA, NF-YB, and NF-YC, targets the CCAAT box, a common cis-element in eukaryotic promoters. We recently identified a gene TaNF-YA10-1 from the wheat salinity tolerant cultivar SR3 and found that recombinant TaNF-YA10-1 could successfully bind to the CCAAT motif in vitro. We also showed that the constitutive expression of TaNF-YA10-1 in Arabidopsis thaliana significantly increased the plant's sensitivity to salinity. Here, we further demonstrated that TaNF-YA10-1 -overexpressing plants conferred drought tolerance as judged from the relative root length and whole-plant growth under drought stress. These results suggest that TaNF-YA10-1 functions independently in salinity and drought stress. Our findings are helpful in understanding the distinct roles of NF-YA in plant stress responses."

"26057628","abstracttext","Group A protein phosphatases 2Cs (PP2Cs) are essential components of abscisic acid (ABA) signaling in Arabidopsis; however, the function of group F2 subfamily PP2Cs is currently less known. In this study, TaPP2C1 which belongs to group F2 was isolated and characterized from wheat. Expression of the TaPP2C1-GFP fusion protein suggested its ubiquitous localization within a cell. TaPP2C1 expression was downregulated by abscisic acid (ABA) and NaCl treatments, but upregulated by H2O2 treatment. Overexpression of TaPP2C1 in tobacco resulted in reduced ABA sensitivity and increased salt resistance of transgenic seedlings. Additionally, physiological analyses showed that improved resistance to salt stress conferred by TaPP2C1 is due to the reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, the improved antioxidant system, and the increased transcription of genes in the ABA-independent pathway. Finally, transgenic tobacco showed increased resistance to oxidative stress by maintaining a more effective antioxidant system. Taken together, these results demonstrated that TaPP2C1 negatively regulates ABA signaling, but positively regulates salt resistance. TaPP2C1 confers salt resistance through activating the antioxidant system and ABA-independent gene transcription process."

"25562483","abstracttext","Transcription of the vernalization1 gene (VRN1) is induced by prolonged cold (vernalization) to trigger flowering of cereal crops, such as wheat and barley. VRN1 encodes a MADS box transcription factor that promotes flowering by regulating the expression of other genes. Here we use transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) and chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) to identify direct targets of VRN1. Over 500 genomic regions were identified as potential VRN1-binding targets by ChIP-seq. VRN1 binds the promoter of flowering locus T-like 1, a promoter of flowering in vernalized plants. VRN1 also targets vernalization2 and ODDSOC2, repressors of flowering that are downregulated in vernalized plants. RNA-seq identified additional VRN1 targets that might play roles in triggering flowering. Other targets of VRN1 include genes that play central roles in low-temperature-induced freezing tolerance, spike architecture and hormone metabolism. This provides evidence for direct regulatory links between the vernalization response pathway and other important traits in cereal crops."

"25610702","abstracttext","Azospirillum brasilense is a nitrogen-fixing bacterium living in association with plant roots. The genome of the strain Sp245, isolated in Brazil from wheat roots, consists of one chromosome and six plasmids. In this work, the A. brasilense Sp245 plasmids were analyzed in order to shed some light on the evolutionary pathways they followed over time. To this purpose, a similarity network approach was applied in order to identify the evolutionary relationships among all the A. brasilense plasmids encoded proteins; in this context a computational pipeline specifically devoted to the analysis and the visualization of the network-like evolutionary relationships among different plasmids molecules was developed. This information was supplemented with a detailed (in silico) functional characterization of both the connected (i.e., sharing homology with other sequences in the dataset) and the unconnected (i.e., not sharing homology) components of the network. Furthermore, the most likely source organism for each of the genes encoded by A. brasilense plasmids was checked, allowing the identification of possible trends of gene loss/gain in this microorganism. Data obtained provided a detailed description of the evolutionary landscape of the plasmids of A. brasilense Sp245, suggesting some of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the present-day structure of these molecules."

"25512632","abstracttext","Cyclodextrin glucanotransferases (CGTases; EC 2.4.1.19) have mainly been characterized for their ability to produce cyclodextrins (CDs) from starch in an intramolecular transglycosylation reaction (cyclization). However, this class of enzymes can also catalyze intermolecular transglycosylation via disproportionation or coupling reactions onto a wide array of acceptors and could therefore be valuable as a tool for glycosylation.In this paper, we report the gene isolation, via the CODEHOP strategy, expression and characterization of a novel CGTase (CspCGT13) from a Carboxydocella sp. This enzyme is the first glycoside hydrolase isolated from the genus, indicating starch degradation via cyclodextrin production in the Carboxydocella strain. The fundamental reactivities of this novel CGTase are characterized and compared with two commercial CGTases, assayed under identical condition, in order to facilitate interpretation of the results. The comparison showed that the enzyme, CspCGT13, displayed high coupling activity using γ-CD as donor, despite preferentially forming α- and β-CD in the cyclization reaction using wheat starch as substrate. Comparison of subsite conservation within previously characterized CGTases showed significant sequence variation in subsites -3 and -7, which may be important for the coupling activity."

"25627073","abstracttext","In eukaryotic cells, MADS-box genes are known to play major regulatory roles in various biological processes by combinatorial interactions with other transcription factors. In this study, we functionally characterized the FgMCM1 MADS-box gene in Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of wheat and barley head blight. Deletion of FgMCM1 resulted in the loss of perithecium production and phialide formation. The Fgmcm1 mutant was significantly reduced in virulence, deoxynivalenol biosynthesis and conidiation. In yeast two-hybrid assays, FgMcm1 interacted with Mat1-1-1 and Fst12, two transcription factors important for sexual reproduction. Whereas Fgmcm1 mutants were unstable and produced stunted subcultures, Fgmcm1 mat1-1-1 but not Fgmcm1 fst12 double mutants were stable. Furthermore, spontaneous suppressor mutations occurred frequently in stunted subcultures to recover growth rate. Ribonucleic acid sequencing analysis indicated that a number of sexual reproduction-related genes were upregulated in stunted subcultures compared with the Fgmcm1 mutant, which was downregulated in the expression of genes involved in pathogenesis, secondary metabolism and conidiation. We also showed that culture instability was not observed in the Fvmcm1 mutants of the heterothallic Fusarium verticillioides. Overall, our data indicate that FgMcm1 plays a critical role in the regulation of cell identity, sexual and asexual reproduction, secondary metabolism and pathogenesis in F. graminearum."

Phenotypic analysis of Caprin2(cKO/cKO) mutants revealed distinct eye defects at variable penetrance. Wheat germ agglutinin staining and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that Caprin2(cKO/cKO) mutants have an abnormally compact lens nucleus, which is the core of the lens comprised of centrally located terminally differentiated fiber cells. Additionally, Caprin2(cKO/cKO) mutants also exhibited at 8% penetrance a developmental defect that resembles a human condition called Peters anomaly, wherein the lens and the cornea remain attached by a persistent stalk."

"25989314","abstracttext","Development of xylose-fermenting yeast strains that are tolerant to the inhibitors present in lignocellulosic hydrolysates is crucial to achieve efficient bioethanol production processes. In this study, the importance of the propagation strategy for obtaining robust cells was studied. Addition of hydrolysate during propagation of the cells adapted them to the inhibitors, resulting in more tolerant cells with shorter lag phases and higher specific growth rates in minimal medium containing acetic acid and vanillin than unadapted cells. Addition of hydrolysate during propagation also resulted in cells with better fermentation capabilities. Cells propagated without hydrolysate were unable to consume xylose in wheat straw hydrolysate fermentations, whereas 40.3% and 97.7% of the xylose was consumed when 12% and 23% (v/v) hydrolysate, respectively, was added during propagation. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction revealed changes in gene expression, depending on the concentration of hydrolysate added during propagation. This study highlights the importance of using an appropriate propagation strategy for the optimum performance of yeast in fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates."

Typically, marker platforms have addressed only one of these objectives."
"25880848","abstracttext_results","We have developed spiked genotyping-by-sequencing (sGBS), which combines targeted amplicon sequencing with reduced representation genotyping-by-sequencing.

This open platform allows multiple, single-target loci to be assayed while simultaneously generating a whole-genome profile. This dual-genotyping approach allows different sets of samples to be evaluated for single markers or whole genome-profiling. Here, we report the application of sGBS on a winter wheat panel that was screened for converted KASP markers and newly-designed markers targeting known polymorphisms in the leaf rust resistance gene Lr34."

"25869057","abstracttext","Elucidating the relationships between gene expression and the physiological mechanisms remains a bottleneck in breeding for resistance to salinity and drought. This study related the expression of key target genes with the physiological performance of durum wheat under different combinations of salinity and irrigation. The candidate genes assayed included two encoding for the DREB (dehydration responsive element binding) transcription factors TaDREB1A and TaDREB2B, another two for the cytosolic and plastidic glutamine synthetase (TaGS1 and TaGS2), and one for the specific Na(+) /H(+) vacuolar antiporter (TaNHX1). Expression of these genes was related to growth and different trait indicators of nitrogen metabolism (nitrogen content, stable nitrogen isotope composition, and glutamine synthetase and nitrate reductase activities), photosynthetic carbon metabolism (stable carbon isotope composition and different gas exchange traits) and ion accumulation. Significant interaction between genotype and growing conditions occurred for growth, nitrogen content, and the expression of most genes. In general terms, higher expression of TaGS1, TaGS2, TaDREB2B, and to a lesser extent of TaNHX1 were associated with a better genotypic performance in growth, nitrogen, and carbon photosynthetic metabolism under salinity and water stress. However, TaDREB1A was increased in expression under stress compared with control conditions, with tolerant genotypes exhibiting lower expression than susceptible ones."

"25832747","abstracttext","We dissected barley chromosomes 1H and 6H added to common wheat by the gametocidal system and identified structural changes of the chromosomes by fluorescence in situ hybridization and genomic in situ hybridization. We found five aberrations of chromosome 1H, all of which lacked the long arm: one small fragment with the subtelomeric HvT01 sequence, one terminal deletion, and three telocentric chromosomes of the short arm. We established 33 dissection lines carrying single aberrant 6H chromosomes, of which 15 were deletions, 16 were translocations and two were isochromosomes. We conducted PCR analysis of the aberrant barley chromosomes using 75 and 81 EST markers specific to chromosomes 1H and 6H, respectively. This enabled us to construct a cytological map of chromosome 6H and to compare it to the previously reported genetic map and also to the physical map, which were released by the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium. The marker orders on the three maps were largely in agreement. The cytological map had better resolution in the proximal region of chromosome 6H than the corresponding genetic map. We discuss some of the discrepancies in marker order between the three maps that might be due to intraspecific polymorphism and gene duplication, as well as to technical problems inherent in the physical mapping process."

"25721474","abstracttext","Melanin production in many fungal phytopathogens has been investigated to play direct or indirect role in pathogenesis. However, in Bipolaris sorokiniana, the spot blotch pathogen of wheat, much less is known about the role melanin play in pathogenesis. As an extension of our previous report, the present study aims to investigate the plausible association between melanin production and virulence factor in B. sorokiniana. In the previous study, we carried out analysis on the antifungal efficacy of biosynthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against B. sorokiniana. The present investigation revealed the gene expression analysis of melanin biosynthesis genes viz. polyketide synthase (PKS1) and scytalone dehydratase (SCD1) under the influence of AgNPs. The 0.05mg/ml concentration of AgNPs yielded noticeable inhibition of B. sorokiniana growth, while 0.1mg/ml concentration of AgNPs accounted for complete inhibition of pathogen growth. In addition, the semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis exhibited reduced expression of PKS1 and SCD1 under the influence of AgNPs treatment. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR demonstrated 6.47 and 1.808 fold significant decrease in the expression pattern of PKS1 and SCD1, respectively, in B. sorokiniana treated with AgNPs. The present study provides probable understanding of molecular events underlying the antifungal role of AgNPs against B. sorokiniana."

"25619909","abstracttext","Water chickweed (Myosoton aquaticum L.), a competitive broadleaf weed, is widespread in wheat fields in China. Tribenuron and pyroxsulam failed to control water chickweed in the same field in Qiaotian Village in 2011 and 2012, respectively. An initial tribenuron resistance confirmation test identified a resistant population (AH02). ALS gene sequencing revealed a previously unreported substitution of Glu for Pro at amino acid position 197 in resistant individuals. A purified subpopulation (WRR04) that was individually homozygous for the Pro197Glu substitution was generated and characterized in terms of its response to different classes of ALS inhibitors. A whole-plant experiment showed that the WRR04 population exhibited broad-spectrum resistance to tribenuron (SU, 318-fold), pyrithiobac sodium (PTB, > 197-fold), pyroxsulam (TP, 81-fold), florasulam (TP, > 36-fold) and imazethapyr (IMI, 11-fold). An in vitro ALS assay confirmed that the ALS from WRR04 showed high resistance to all the tested ALS inhibitors. These results established that the Pro197Glu substitution endows broad-spectrum resistance across ALS inhibitors in water chickweed. In addition, molecular markers were developed to rapidly identify the Pro197Glu mutation."

"26854841","abstracttext","Taste cells release neurotransmitters to gustatory neurons to transmit chemical information they received. Sweet, umami, and bitter taste cells use ATP as a neurotransmitter. However, ATP release from sour taste cells has not been observed so far. Instead, they release serotonin when they are activated by sour/acid stimuli. Thus it is still controversial whether sour taste cells use ATP, serotonin, or both. By reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and subsequent in situ hybridization (ISH) analyses, we revealed that of 14 serotonin receptor genes only 5-HT3A and 5-HT3B showed significant/clear signals in a subset of neurons of cranial sensory ganglia in which gustatory neurons reside. Double-fluorescent labeling analyses of ISH for serotonin receptor genes with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) in cranial sensory ganglia of pkd1l3-WGA mice whose sour neural pathway is visualized by the distribution of WGA originating from sour taste cells in the posterior region of the tongue revealed that WGA-positive cranial sensory neurons rarely express either of serotonin receptor gene. These results suggest that serotonin receptors expressed in cranial sensory neurons do not play any role as neurotransmitter receptor from sour taste cells."

"26811609","abstracttext","Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer diagnosed worldwide in human beings. Surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies are the conventional four approaches which are currently used for the treatment of CRC. The site specific delivery of chemotherapeutics to their site of action would increase effectiveness with reducing side effects. Targeted oral drug delivery systems based on polysaccharides are being investigated to target and deliver chemotherapeutic and chemopreventive agents directly to colon and rectum. Site-specific drug delivery to colon increases its concentration at the target site, and thus requires a lower dose and hence abridged side effects. Some novel therapies are also briefly discussed in article such as receptor (epidermal growth factor receptor, folate receptor, wheat germ agglutinin, VEGF receptor, hyaluronic acid receptor) based targeting therapy; colon targeted proapoptotic anticancer drug delivery system, gene therapy. Even though good treatment options are available for CRC, the ultimate therapeutic approach is to avert the incidence of CRC. It was also found that CRCs could be prevented by diet and nutrition such as calcium, vitamin D, curcumin, quercetin and fish oil supplements. Immunotherapy and vaccination are used nowadays which are showing better results against CRC."

"26715074","abstracttext","Herbaspirillum seropedicae Z67 is a diazotrophic endophyte able to colonize the interior of many economically relevant crops such as rice, wheat, corn and sorghum. Under iron-deficient conditions, this organism secretes serobactins, a suite of lipopetide siderophores. The role of siderophores in the interaction between endophytes and their plant hosts are not well understood. In this work, we aimed to determine the importance of serobactins-mediated iron acquisition systems in the interaction of H. seropedicae with rice plants. First we provide evidence, by using a combination of genome analysis, proteomic and genetic studies, that the Hsero_2345 gene encodes a TonB-dependent receptor involved in iron-serobactin complex internalization when iron bioavailability is low. Our results show that survival of the Hsero_2345 mutant inside rice plants was not significantly different from that of the wild-type strain. However, when plants were co-inoculated at equal ratios with the wild-type strain and with a double mutant defective in serobactins synthesis and internalization, recovery of mutant was significantly impaired after 8 days post-inoculation. These results demonstrate that serobactins-mediated iron acquisition contributes to competitive fitness of H. seropedicae inside host plants."

Early-season planting extends sorghum's growing season and increases yield in temperate regions. However, sorghum's sensitivity to low soil temperatures adversely impacts seed germination. In this study, we evaluated the 242 accessions of the ICRISAT sorghum mini core collection for seed germination and seedling vigor at 12 °C as a measure of cold tolerance. Genome-wide association analysis was performed with approximately 162,177 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Only one marker locus (Locus 7-2) was significantly associated with low-temperature germination and none with vigor. The linkage of Locus 7-2 to low-temperature germination was supported by four lines of evidence: strong association in three independent experiments, co-localization with previously mapped cold tolerance quantitative trait loci (QTL) in sorghum, a candidate gene that increases cold tolerance and germination rate when its wheat homolog is overexpressed in tobacco, and its syntenic region in rice co-localized with two cold tolerance QTL in rice. This locus may be useful in developing tools for molecular breeding of sorghums with improved low-temperature germinability."

Fungal extracts rich in prolyl endopeptidases produced by a species such as Aspergillus oryzae used in food fermentation would be of particular interest for the development of an oral enzyme therapy product in patients affected by intolerance to gluten. Two major A. oryzae secreted prolyl endopeptidases of the MEROPS S28 peptidase family, AoS28A and AoS28B, were identified when this fungus was grown at acidic pH in a medium containing soy meal protein or wheat gliadin as the sole source of nitrogen. AoS28B was produced by 12 reference A. oryzae strains used in food fermentation. AoS28A was secreted by six of these 12 strains. This protease is the orthologue of the previously characterized Aspergillus fumigatus (AfuS28) and Aspergillus niger (AN-PEP) prolyl endopeptidases which are encoded by genes with a similar intron-exon structure. Large amounts of secreted AoS28A and AoS28B were obtained by gene overexpression in A. oryzae. AoS28A and AoS28B are endoproteases able to cleave N-terminally blocked proline substrates. Both enzymes very efficiently digested the proline-rich 33-mer of gliadin, the most representative immunotoxic peptide deriving from gliadin, with some differences in terms of specificity and optimal pH. Digestion of the gliadin peptide in short peptides with both enzymes was found to occur from its N terminus."

These include the development of new analyses and views to represent polyploid genomes (of which bread wheat is the primary exemplar); and the continued up-scaling of the resource, which now includes over 23 000 bacterial genomes, 400 fungal genomes and 100 protist genomes, in addition to 55 genomes from invertebrate metazoa and 39 genomes from plants. This dramatic increase in the number of included genomes is one part of a broader effort to automate the integration of archival data (genome sequence, but also associated RNA sequence data and variant calls) within the context of reference genomes and make it available through the Ensembl user interfaces."

"26381081","abstracttext_methods and results","Ninety-five Alternaria (A.) strains were characterized by their colony colour, their three-dimensional sporulation patterns, mycotoxin production and phylogenetic relationships based on sequence variation in translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF1-α). The examination of toxin profiles and the phylogenetic features via TEF1-α resulted in two distinct clusters, in each case containing Alternaria infectoria isolates (92 and 96% respectively) in the first and the Alternaria alternata, Alternaria arborescens and Alternaria tenuissima isolates (77 and 79% respectively) in the other combined cluster. The production of Alternariol, Altertoxin and Altenuene has not been reported previously in the A. infectoria species group. The isolates from Germany and Russia differ slightly in species composition and mycotoxin production capacity."

"26694350","abstracttext","Mutations induced by radiation are widely used for developing new varieties of plants. To better understand the frequency and pattern of irradiation-induced chromosomal rearrangements, we irradiated the dry seeds of Chinese Spring (CS)-Dasypyrum villosum nullisomic-tetrasomic (6A/6D) addition (6V) line (2n = 44), WD14, with (60)Co-γ-rays at dosages of 100, 200, and 300 Gy. The M₀ and M₁ generations were analyzed using Feulgen staining and non-denaturing fluorescence in situ hybridization (ND-FISH) by using oligonucleotide probes. Abnormal mitotic behavior and chromosomes with structural changes were observed in the M₀ plants. In all, 39 M₁ plants had structurally changed chromosomes, with the B genome showing the highest frequency of aberrations and tendency to recombine with chromosomes of the D genome. In addition, 19 M₁ plants showed a variation in chromosome number. The frequency of chromosome loss was considerably higher for 6D than for the alien chromosome 6V, indicating that 6D is less stable after irradiation. Our findings suggested that the newly obtained γ-induced genetic materials might be beneficial for future wheat breeding programs and functional gene analyses."

"27109369","abstracttext","Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) is a powerful molecular marker technique that has been widely used in population genetics and molecular mapping studies for various organisms. However, the technique has not been used for studying Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the wheat stripe rust pathogen. In this study, we developed over a hundred secreted protein gene-derived SNP (SP-SNP) markers and used 92 markers to study the population structure of Pst. From 352 isolates collected in the United States, we identified 242 multi-locus genotypes. The SP-SNP genotypes had a moderate, but significant correlation with the virulence phenotype data. Clustering of the multi-locus genotypes was consistent by various analyses, revealing distinct genetic groups. Analysis of molecular variance detected significant differences between the eastern and western US Pst populations. High heterozygosity was found in the US population with significant differences identified among epidemiological regions. Analysis of population differentiation revealed that populations between the eastern and western US were highly differentiated while moderate differentiation was found in populations within the western or eastern US. Isolates from the western US were more diverse than isolates from the eastern US. The information is useful for guiding the disease management in different epidemiological regions."

"27111722","abstracttext","Wild relatives of domesticated crop species harbor multiple, diverse, disease resistance (R) genes that could be used to engineer sustainable disease control. However, breeding R genes into crop lines often requires long breeding timelines of 5-15 years to break linkage between R genes and deleterious alleles (linkage drag). Further, when R genes are bred one at a time into crop lines, the protection that they confer is often overcome within a few seasons by pathogen evolution. If several cloned R genes were available, it would be possible to pyramid R genes in a crop, which might provide more durable resistance. We describe a three-step method (MutRenSeq)-that combines chemical mutagenesis with exome capture and sequencing for rapid R gene cloning. We applied MutRenSeq to clone stem rust resistance genes Sr22 and Sr45 from hexaploid bread wheat. MutRenSeq can be applied to other commercially relevant crops and their relatives, including, for example, pea, bean, barley, oat, rye, rice and maize."

"27056577","abstracttext","γ-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) is consumed by yeasts during fermentation. To prevent GABA reduction in bread dough, a baker's yeast mutant AY77 deficient in GABA assimilation was characterized and utilized for wheat dough fermentation. An amber mutation in the DAL81 gene, which codes for a positive regulator of multiple nitrogen degradation pathways, was found in the AY77 strain. The qPCR analyses of genes involved in nitrogen utilization showed that transcriptional levels of the UGA1 and DUR3 genes encoding GABA transaminase and urea transporter, respectively, are severely decreased in the AY77 cells. The AY77 strain cultivated by fed-batch culture using cane molasses exhibited inferior gas production during dough fermentation compared to that of wild-type strain AY13. However, when fed with molasses containing 0.5% ammonium sulfate, the mutant strain exhibited gas production comparable to that of the AY13 strain. In contrast to the AY13 strain, which completely consumed GABA in dough within 5 h, the AY77 strain consumed no GABA under either culture condition. Dough fermentation with the dal81 mutant strain should be useful for suppression of GABA reduction in breads."

"27095404","abstracttext","Calcium-binding proteins play key roles in the signal transduction in the growth and stress response in eukaryotes. However, a subfamily of proteins with one EF-hand motif has not been fully studied in higher plants. Here, a novel small calcium-binding protein with a C-terminal centrin-like domain (CCD1) in rice, OsCCD1, was characterized to show high similarity with a TaCCD1 in wheat. As a result, OsCCD1 can bind Ca(2+) in the in vitro EMSA and the fluorescence staining calcium-binding assays. Transient expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged OsCCD1 in rice protoplasts showed that OsCCD1 was localized in the nucleus and cytosol of rice cells. OsCCD1 transcript levels were transiently induced by osmotic stress and salt stress through the calcium-mediated ABA signal. The rice seedlings of T-DNA mutant lines showed significantly less tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses than wild type plants (p<0.01). Conversely, its overexpressors can significantly enhance the tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses than wild type plants (p<0.05). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that, OsDREB2B, OsAPX1 and OsP5CS genes are involved in the rice tolerance to osmotic and salt stresses. In sum, OsCCD1 gene probably affects the DREB2B and its downstream genes to positively regulate osmotic and salt tolerance in rice seedlings."
"27103853","articletitle","Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species via NOXa Is Important for Development and Pathogenicity of Mycosphaerella graminicola."
"27103853","abstracttext","The ascomycete fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola (synonym Zymoseptoria tritici) is an important pathogen of wheat causing economically significant losses. The primary nutritional mode of this fungus is thought to be hemibiotrophic. This pathogenic lifestyle is associated with an early biotrophic stage of nutrient uptake followed by a necrotrophic stage aided possibly by production of a toxin or reactive oxygen species (ROS). In many other fungi, the genes CREA and AREA are important during the biotrophic stage of infection, while the NOXa gene product is important during necrotrophic growth. To test the hypothesis that these genes are important for pathogenicity of M. graminicola, we employed an over-expression strategy for the selected target genes CREA, AREA, and NOXa, which might function as regulators of nutrient acquisition or ROS generation. Increased expressions of CREA, AREA, and NOXa in M. graminicola were confirmed via quantitative real-time PCR and strains were subsequently assayed for pathogenicity. Among them, the NOXa over-expression strain, NO2, resulted in significantly increased virulence. Moreover, instead of the usual filamentous growth, we observed a predominance of yeast-like growth of NO2 which was correlated with ROS production. Our data indicate that ROS generation via NOXa is important to pathogenicity as well as development in M. graminicola."

"27007904","abstracttext","In the pursuit of sustainable agriculture, bioinoculants usage as providers of a crop's needs is a method to limit environmental damage. In this study, a collection of cultivable putative plant growth promoting (PGP) bacteria associated with wheat crops was obtained and this bacterial sample was characterized in relation to the functional diversity of certain PGP features. The isolates were obtained through classical cultivation methods, identified by partial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and characterized for PGP traits of interest. Functional diversity characterization was performed using Categorical Principal Component Analysis (CatPCA) and Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA). The most abundant genera found among the 346 isolates were Pseudomonas, Burkholderia, and Enterobacter. Occurrence of PGP traits was affected by genus, niche, and sampling site. A large number of genera grouped together with the ability to produce indolic compounds; phosphate solubilization and siderophores production formed a second group related to fewer genera, in which the genus Burkholderia has a great importance. The results obtained may help future studies aiming prospection of putative plant growth promoting bacteria regarding the desired organism and PGP trait."

"27051662","abstracttext","As plenty of nonmodel plants are without genomic sequences, the combination of molecular technologies and the next generation sequencing (NGS) platform has led to a new approach to study the genetic variations of these plants. Software GATK, SOAPsnp, samtools, and others are often used to deal with the NGS data. In this study, BLAST was applied to call SNPs from 16 mixed functional gene's sequence data of polyploidy wheat. In total 1.2 million reads were obtained with the average of 7500 reads per genes. To get accurate information, 390,992 pair reads were successfully assembled before aligning to those functional genes. Standalone BLAST tools were used to map assembled sequence to functional genes, respectively. Polynomial fitting was applied to find the suitable minor allele frequency (MAF) threshold at 6% for assembled reads of each functional gene. SNPs accuracy form assembled reads, pretrimmed reads, and original reads were compared, which declared that SNPs mined from the assembled reads were more reliable than others. It was also demonstrated that mixed samples' NGS sequences and then analysis by BLAST were an effective, low-cost, and accurate way to mine SNPs for nonmodel species. Assembled reads and polynomial fitting threshold were recommended for more accurate SNPs target."

"26990214","abstracttext","Head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum threatens world-wide wheat production, resulting in both yield loss and mycotoxin contamination. We reconstructed the global F. graminearum gene regulatory network (GRN) from a large collection of transcriptomic data using Bayesian network inference, a machine-learning algorithm. This GRN reveals connectivity between key regulators and their target genes. Focusing on key regulators, this network contains eight distinct but interwoven modules. Enriched for unique functions, such as cell cycle, DNA replication, transcription, translation and stress responses, each module exhibits distinct expression profiles. Evolutionarily, the F. graminearum genome can be divided into core regions shared with closely related species and variable regions harboring genes that are unique to F. graminearum and perform species-specific functions. Interestingly, the inferred top regulators regulate genes that are significantly enriched from the same genomic regions (P < 0.05), revealing a compartmentalized network structure that may reflect network rewiring related to specific adaptation of this plant pathogen. This first-ever reconstructed filamentous fungal GRN primes our understanding of pathogenicity at the systems biology level and provides enticing prospects for novel disease control strategies involving the targeting of master regulators in pathogens. The program can be used to construct GRNs of other plant pathogens."
"27296968","articletitle","Role of Vfr in the regulation of antifungal compound production by Pseudomonas fluorescens FD6."
"27296968","abstracttext","Pseudomonas fluorescens FD6 has been shown to possess many beneficial traits involved in the biocontrol of fungal plant pathogens, such as Botrytis cinerea and Monilinia fructicola. Vfr (virulence factor regulator) a highly conserved global regulator of gram-negative bacteria, such as the human pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is required for the expression of many important virulence traits. The role of Vfr in the regulation of biocontrol traits, such as the production of antibiotics to control fungal pathogens by antagonistic bacteria, has not been elucidated. This study investigated the effect of a vfr mutant derived from P. fluorescens FD6 to better understand the regulation of some important biocontrol traits associated with the bacterium. Biochemical studies indicated that the production of the antibiotics 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyrrolnitrin and pyoluteorin, was markedly enhanced in the vfr mutant. The vfr mutation also increased biofilm production, swimming motility and the expression of exopolysaccharide-associated gene (pelA, pslA and pslB) transcripts, but reduced protease production. Wheat rhizosphere and root tip colonization by the vfr mutant was higher than that by the wild type at 7 and 21days after inoculation. These findings demonstrate that Vfr modulates the expression of several key traits and the production of important antibiotics involved in the biocontrol potential of P. fluorescens FD6."

"27497661","abstracttext","The use of analytical controls is essential when performing GMO detection through screening tests. Additionally, the presence of taxon-specific sequences is analyzed mostly for quality control during GMO detection. In this study, 11 commonly used genetic elements involving three promoters (P-35S, P-FMV35S and P-NOS), four marker genes (Bar, NPTII, HPT and Pmi), and four terminators (T-NOS, T-35S, T-g7 and T-e9), together with the reference gene fragments from six major crops of maize, soybean, rapeseed, rice, cotton and wheat, were co-integrated into the same single plasmid to construct a general reference plasmid pBI121-Screening. The suitability test of pBI121-Screening plasmid as reference material indicated that the non-target sequence on the pBI121-Screening plasmid did not affect the PCR amplification efficiencies of screening methods and taxon-specific methods. The sensitivity of screening and taxon-specific assays ranged from 5 to 10 copies of pBI121-Screening plasmid, meeting the sensitivity requirement of GMO detection. The construction of pBI121-Screening solves the lack of a general positive control for screening tests, thereby reducing the workload and cost of preparing a plurality of the positive control."

"27352228","abstracttext","Cell walls and cellular turgor pressure shape and suspend the bodies of all vascular plants. In response to attack by fungal and oomycete pathogens, which usually breach their host's cell walls by mechanical force or by secreting lytic enzymes, plants often form local cell wall appositions (papillae) as an important first line of defence. The involvement of cell wall biosynthetic enzymes in the formation of these papillae is still poorly understood, especially in cereal crops. To investigate the role in plant defence of a candidate gene from barley (Hordeum vulgare) encoding cellulose synthase-like D2 (HvCslD2), we generated transgenic barley plants in which HvCslD2 was silenced through RNA interference (RNAi). The transgenic plants showed no growth defects but their papillae were more successfully penetrated by host-adapted, virulent as well as avirulent nonhost isolates of the powdery mildew fungus Blumeria graminis. Papilla penetration was associated with lower contents of cellulose in epidermal cell walls and increased digestion by fungal cell wall degrading enzymes. The results suggest that HvCslD2-mediated cell wall changes in the epidermal layer represent an important defence reaction both for nonhost and for quantitative host resistance against nonadapted wheat and host-adapted barley powdery mildew pathogens, respectively."

"29116579","abstracttext","Abiotic stresses like drought, salinity, high and low temperature, and submergence are major factors that limit the crop productivity. Hence, identification of genes associated with stress response in crops is a prerequisite for improving their tolerance to adverse environmental conditions. In an earlier study, we had identified a drought-inducible gene, vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (TaVAP), in developing grains of wheat. In this study, we demonstrate that TaVAP is able to complement yeast and Arabidopsis mutants, which are impaired in their respective orthologs, signifying functional conservation. Constitutive expression of TaVAP in Arabidopsis imparted tolerance to water stress conditions without any apparent yield penalty. Enhanced tolerance to water stress was associated with maintenance of higher relative water content, photosynthetic efficiency, and antioxidant activities. Compared to wild type, the TaVAP-overexpressing plants showed enhanced lateral root proliferation that was attributed to higher endogenous levels of IAA. These studies are the first to demonstrate that TaVAP plays a critical role in growth and development in plants, and is a potential candidate for improving the abiotic stress tolerance in crop plants."

"29160564","abstracttext","Under salinity, Vitis spp. rootstocks can mediate salt (NaCl) exclusion from grafted V. vinifera scions enabling higher grapevine yields and production of superior wines with lower salt content. Until now, the genetic and mechanistic elements controlling sodium (Na + ) exclusion in grapevine were unknown. Using a cross between two Vitis interspecific hybrid rootstocks, we mapped a dominant quantitative trait locus (QTL) associated with leaf Na + exclusion (NaE) under salinity stress. The NaE locus encodes six high-affinity potassium transporters (HKT). Transcript profiling and functional characterization in heterologous systems identified VisHKT1;1 as the best candidate gene for controlling leaf Na + exclusion. We characterized four proteins encoded by unique VisHKT1;1 alleles from the parents, and revealed that the dominant HKT variants exhibit greater Na + conductance with less rectification than the recessive variants. Mutagenesis of VisHKT1;1 and TaHKT1.5-D from bread wheat, demonstrated that charged amino acid residues in the eighth predicted transmembrane domain of HKT proteins reduces inward Na + conductance, and causes inward rectification of Na + transport. The origin of the recessive VisHKT1;1 alleles was traced to V. champinii and V. rupestris. We propose that the genetic and functional data presented here will assist with breeding Na + -tolerant grapevine rootstocks."

"29173636","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a destructive disease of cereals crops worldwide and a major food safety concern due to grain contamination with trichothecenes and other mycotoxins. Fusarium graminearum, a member of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC) is the dominant FHB pathogen in many parts of the world. However, a number of other Fusarium species, including other members of the FGSC, may also be present for example in Argentina, New Zealand, Ethiopia, Nepal, Unites States in cereals such as wheat and barley. Proper species identification is critical to research aimed at improving disease and mycotoxin control programs. Identification of Fusarium species is are often unreliable by traditional, as many species are morphologically cryptic. DNA sequence-based methods offer a reliable means of species identification, but can be expensive when applied to the analyses of population samples. To facilitate identification of the major causative agent of FHB, this work describes an easy and inexpensive method to differentiate F. graminearum from the remaining species within the FGSC and from the other common Fusarium species causing FHB in cereals. The developed method is based on a PCR-RFLP of the transcription elongation factor (TEF 1-α) gene using the restriction enzyme BsaHI."

"28445036","abstracttext","Agricultural soils are major sinks of silver nanoparticles in the environment, and crops are directly exposed to these emerging contaminants. A clear picture of their chemical transformations, uptake and transport mechanisms, and phytotoxic impacts is still lacking. In this work, wheat plants were exposed to pristine metallic (Ag-NPs) and sulfidized (Ag 2 S-NPs) silver nanoparticles and ionic Ag. Data on Ag distribution and speciation, phytotoxicity markers, and gene expression were studied. A multi-technique and multi-scale approach was applied, combining innovating tools at both the laboratory and synchrotron. Various chemical transformations were observed on the epidermis and inside roots, even for Ag 2 S-NPs, leading to an exposure to multiple Ag forms, which likely evolve over time. Genes involved in various functions including oxidative stress, defense against pathogens, and metal homeostasis were impacted in different ways depending upon the Ag source. This study illustrates the complexity of the toxicity pattern for plants exposed to Ag-NPs, the necessity of monitoring several markers to accurately evaluate the toxicity, and the interest of interpreting the toxicity pattern in light of the distribution and speciation of Ag."
"28435841","articletitle","Evading plant immunity: feedback control of the T3SS in Pseudomonas syringae ."
"28435841","abstracttext","Microbes are responsible for over 10% of the global yield losses in staple crops such as wheat, rice, and maize. Understanding the decision-making strategies that enable bacterial plant pathogens to evade the host immune system and cause disease is essential for managing their ever growing threat to food security. Many utilise the needle-like type III secretion system (T3SS) to suppress plant immunity, by injecting effector proteins that inhibit eukaryotic signalling pathways into the host cell cytoplasm. Plants can in turn evolve resistance to specific pathogens via recognition and blocking of the T3SS effectors, so leading to an ongoing co-evolutionary 'arms race' between pathogen and host pairs. The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor HrpL co-ordinates the expression of the T3SS regulon in the leaf-dwelling Pseudomonas syringae and similar pathogens. Recently, we showed that association of HrpL with a target promoter directly adjacent to the hrpL gene imposes negative autogenous control on its own expression level due to overlapping regulatory elements. Our results suggest that by down-regulating T3SS function, this fine-tuning mechanism enables P. syringae to minimise effector-mediated elicitation of plant immunity."

The recombinant PcXylA-wt and I6V, I6L, L18F, N77D, Y125R, H191R, S246P, A293P mutants were successfully expressed and purified for characterization. The mutations did not affect the enzyme specific activity against xylan from wheat as well as its pH-optimum of activity. One mutant (L18F) displayed a higher thermostability relative to the wild-type enzyme; its half-life time at 50-60°C was 2-2.5-fold longer than that for the PcXylA-wt, and the melting temperature was 60.0 and 56.1°C, respectively. Most of other mutations led to decrease in the enzyme thermostability. This study, together with data of other researchers, suggests that multiple mutations should be introduced into GH10 xylanases in order to dramatically improve their stability."

"28596607","abstracttext","Water uptake is the fundamental requirement for the initiation and completion of seed germination that is a vital phase in the life cycle of seed plants. We found that seeds produced under four nitrogen levels showed significantly different germination speed. The objective of this study was to study the mechanism of rapid seed germination and explore which pathways and genes play critical roles in radicle protrusion. Anatomical data revealed that seed protein content affected endosperm structure of seeds. Moreover, scanning electron microscope maps showed that faster germinated seeds had a looser endosperm structure compared with other seeds. Subsequently, high throughout RNA-seq data were used to compare the transcriptomes of imbibed seeds with different germination speed. Gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis revealed that cell wall metabolism related genes significantly up-regulated in faster germinated seeds. In these genes, the top four were chitinase that had about fourfold higher expression in faster germinated seeds. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis showed that faster germinated seeds had enhanced expression in glutathione metabolism. By combining these results, we propose a model for nitrogen fertilizer affects germination speed of wheat seed, which provide new insights into seed germination."

"28483055","abstracttext","F-box protein is a major subunit of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) complex. We previously isolated an F-box gene from wheat, TaFBA1, and here we show that overexpression of TaFBA1 in transgenic plants under salt stress increases germination rate, root elongation, and biomass accumulation compared with WT plants. Improvements in the photosynthetic rate and its corresponding parameters were also found in the transgenic plants. These results suggest that overexpression of TaFBA1 improves salt stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco. Further, the transgenic plants displayed less membrane damage, higher antioxidant enzyme activity, and less accumulation of ROS under salt stress. The transgenic plants also had lower Na + content and higher K + content than WT plants in leaves and roots. The activity of H + -ATPase on the plasma membrane in the transgenic plants was higher than in WT plants, and was accompanied by a net Na + efflux. In the tonoplast, the activity levels of V-ATPase and PPase were also higher in the transgenic plants, thus helping to maximize intracellular Na + compartmentalization. The expression of some stress-related genes was upregulated by salt stress. This suggests that the enhancement of plant salt stress tolerance may be associated with an improvement in antioxidative competition and Na + /K + ion regionalization."

Interestingly, it kept approximately 80% of its β-xylosidase activity in the presence of 0·5% (w/v) furfural and 0·1% (w/v) 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. Additionally, the presence of Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ ions increased the enzymatic activity and conferred complete tolerance to 500 mmol l -1 of xylose. Protein XylM1989 is also able to release sugars from complex polysaccharides."

"28491078","articletitle","The Importance of Being on Time: Regulatory Networks Controlling Photoperiodic Flowering in Cereals."
"28491078","abstracttext","Flowering is the result of the coordination between genetic information and environmental cues. Gene regulatory networks have evolved in plants in order to measure diurnal and seasonal variation of day length (or photoperiod), thus aligning the reproductive phase with the most favorable season of the year. The capacity of plants to discriminate distinct photoperiods classifies them into long and short day species, depending on the conditions that induce flowering. Plants of tropical origin and adapted to short day lengths include rice, maize, and sorghum, whereas wheat and barley were originally domesticated in the Fertile Crescent and are considered long day species. In these and other crops, day length measurement mechanisms have been artificially modified during domestication and breeding to adapt plants to novel areas, to the extent that a wide diversity of responses exists within any given species. Notwithstanding the ample natural and artificial variation of day length responses, some of the basic molecular elements governing photoperiodic flowering are widely conserved. However, as our understanding of the underlying mechanisms improves, it becomes evident that specific regulators exist in many lineages that are not shared by others, while apparently conserved components can be recruited to novel functions during evolution."

The recombinant E. coli produced rBhcell-xyl (CMCase 2272 and 910 U L -1 xylanase). The rBhcell-xyl is a ~62-kDa monomeric protein with temperature and pH optima of 60 °C and 6.0 with T 1/2 of 7.0 and 3.5 h at 80 °C for CMCase and xylanase, respectively. The apparent K m values (CMC and Birchwood xylan) are 3.8 and 3.2 mg mL -1 . The catalytic efficiency (k cat /K m ) values of xylanase and CMCase are 657 and 171 mL mg -1  min -1 , respectively. End-product analysis confirmed that rBhcell-xyl is a unique endo-acting enzyme with exoglucanase activity. The rBhcell-xyl is a GH5 family enzyme possessing single catalytic module and carbohydrate binding module. The action of rBhcell-xyl on corn cobs and wheat bran liberated reducing sugars, which can be fermented to bioethanol and fine biochemicals."

"27580625","abstracttext","An increase in global temperatures will impact future crop yields. In the cereal crops wheat and barley, high temperatures accelerate reproductive development, reducing the number of grains per plant and final grain yield. Despite this relationship between temperature and cereal yield, it is not clear what genes and molecular pathways mediate the developmental response to increased temperatures. The plant circadian clock can respond to changes in temperature and is important for photoperiod-dependent flowering, and so is a potential mechanism controlling temperature responses in cereal crops. This study examines the relationship between temperature, the circadian clock, and the expression of flowering-time genes in barley (Hordeum vulgare), a crop model for temperate cereals. Transcript levels of barley core circadian clock genes were assayed over a range of temperatures. Transcript levels of core clock genes CCA1, GI, PRR59, PRR73, PRR95, and LUX are increased at higher temperatures. CCA1 and PRR73 respond rapidly to a decrease in temperature whereas GI and PRR59 respond rapidly to an increase in temperature. The response of GI and the PRR genes to changes in temperature is lost in the elf3 mutant indicating that their response to temperature may be dependent on a functional ELF3 gene."

"27733857","abstracttext","Salicylic acid is a promising compound for the reduction of stress sensitivity in plants. Although several biochemical and physiological changes have been described in plants treated with salicylic acid, the mode of action of the various treatments has not yet been clarified. The present work reports a detailed comparative study on the effects of different modes of salicylic acid application at the physiological, metabolomic, and transcriptomic levels. Seed soaking and hydroponic treatments were found to induce various changes in the protective mechanisms of wheat plants. The possible involvement of the flavonoid metabolism in salicylic acid-related stress signaling was also demonstrated. Different salicylic acid treatments were shown to induce different physiological and biochemical processes, with varying responses in the leaves and roots. Hydroponic treatment enhanced the level of oxidative stress, the expression of genes involved in the flavonoid metabolism and the amount of non-enzymatic antioxidant compounds, namely ortho-hydroxycinnamic acid and the flavonol quercetin in the leaves, while it decreased the ortho-hydroxycinnamic acid and flavonol contents and enhanced ascorbate peroxidase activity in the roots. In contrast, seed soaking only elevated the gene expression level of phenylalanine ammonia lyase in the roots and caused a slight increase in the amount of flavonols. These results draw attention to the fact that the effects of exogenous salicylic acid application cannot be generalized in different experimental systems and that the flavonoid metabolism may be an important part of the action mechanisms induced by salicylic acid."

This study was aimed at generating genomic information for rice and non-rice Magnaporthe isolates to understand the extent of genetic variation. We have sequenced the whole genome of the Magnaporthe isolates, infecting rice (leaf and neck), finger millet (leaf and neck), foxtail millet (leaf) and buffel grass (leaf). Rice and finger millet isolates infecting both leaf and neck tissues were sequenced, since the damage and yield loss caused due to neck blast is much higher as compared to leaf blast. The genome-wide comparison was carried out to study the variability in gene content, candidate effectors, repeat element distribution, genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and SNPs. The analysis of repeat element footprints revealed some genes such as naringenin, 2-oxoglutarate 3-dioxygenase being targeted by Pot2 and Occan, in isolates from different host species. Some repeat insertions were host-specific while other insertions were randomly shared between isolates. The distributions of repeat elements, secretory proteins, CAZymes and SNPs showed significant variation across host-specific lineages of Magnaporthe indicating an independent genome evolution orchestrated by multiple genomic factors."

"27798598","abstracttext","Pseudomonads are cosmopolitan microorganisms able to produce a wide array of specialized metabolites. These molecules allow Pseudomonas to scavenge nutrients, sense population density and enhance or inhibit growth of competing microorganisms. However, these valuable metabolites are typically characterized one-molecule-one-microbe at a time, instead of being inventoried in large numbers. To index and map the diversity of molecules detected from these organisms, 260 strains of ecologically diverse origins were subjected to mass-spectrometry-based molecular networking. Molecular networking not only enables dereplication of molecules, but also sheds light on their structural relationships. Moreover, it accelerates the discovery of new molecules. Here, by indexing the Pseudomonas specialized metabolome, we report the molecular-networking-based discovery of four molecules and their evolutionary relationships: a poaeamide analogue and a molecular subfamily of cyclic lipopeptides, bananamides 1, 2 and 3. Analysis of their biosynthetic gene cluster shows that it constitutes a distinct evolutionary branch of the Pseudomonas cyclic lipopeptides. Through analysis of an additional 370 extracts of wheat-associated Pseudomonas, we demonstrate how the detailed knowledge from our reference index can be efficiently propagated to annotate complex metabolomic data from other studies, akin to the way in which newly generated genomic information can be compared to data from public databases."

"27803972","abstracttext","Serratia sp. ZM is a plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacterial strain isolated from the rhizospheric soil of Populus euphratica in northwestern China. In this study, low nitrogen supply significantly stimulated the production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) in Serratia sp.ZM. The inoculation of the bacterium to wheat seedlings improved plant growth compared with the uninoculated group, and the stimulating effect was more prominent under low nitrogen stress. Inactivation of the predicted key gene in the IAA biosynthesis pathway impaired IAA production and significantly hampered mutant growth in poor medium. Furthermore, the IAA-deficient mutant lost the PGP effect under either normal or low nitrogen conditions in plant experiments. This study revealed the significant impact of environmental nitrogen levels on IAA production in the PGP strain and the vital effect of IAA on resistance physiology of both the bacterium and host plant. The characteristics of Serratia sp. ZM also indicated its application potential as a biofertilizer for plants, especially those suffering from poor nitrogen soil."

"27888554","abstracttext","Fusarium pseudograminearum is an important pathogen of wheat and barley, particularly in semi-arid environments. Previous genome assemblies for this organism were based entirely on short read data and are highly fragmented. In this work, a genetic map of F. pseudograminearum has been constructed for the first time based on a mapping population of 178 individuals. The genetic map, together with long read scaffolding of a short read-based genome assembly, was used to give a near-complete assembly of the four F. pseudograminearum chromosomes. Large regions of synteny between F. pseudograminearum and F. graminearum, the related pathogen that is the primary causal agent of cereal head blight disease, were previously proposed in the core conserved genome, but the construction of a genetic map to order and orient contigs is critical to the validation of synteny and the placing of species-specific regions. Indeed, our comparative analyses of the genomes of these two related pathogens suggest that rearrangements in the F. pseudograminearum genome have occurred in the chromosome ends. One of these rearrangements includes the transposition of an entire gene cluster involved in the detoxification of the benzoxazolinone (BOA) class of plant phytoalexins. This work provides an important genomic and genetic resource for F. pseudograminearum, which is less well characterized than F. graminearum. In addition, this study provides new insights into a better understanding of the sexual reproduction process in F. pseudograminearum, which informs us of the potential of this pathogen to evolve."

"27969000","abstracttext","The effect of one-day cold-shock on the transcriptome and phytohormones (auxin, cytokinins, abscisic, jasmonic and salicylic acids) was characterised in freezing-sensitive (Chinese Spring), highly freezing-tolerant (Cheyenne) and moderately freezing-tolerant (Chinese Spring substituted with Cheyenne's 5A chromosome) wheat genotypes. Altogether, 636 differentially expressed genes responding to cold-shock were identified. Defence genes encoding LEA proteins, dehydrins, chaperons and other temperature-stress responsive proteins were up-regulated in a genotype-independent manner. Abscisic acid was up-regulated by cold accompanied by adherent expression of its metabolic genes. Data revealed the involvement of particular routes within ABA-dependent signalling in response to cold-shock in the examined genotypes. Cold-shock affected gene expression along carbohydrate metabolic pathways. In photosynthesis, cold-shock changed the expression of a number of genes in the same way as it was previously reported for ABA. Overrepresentation analysis of the differentially expressed genes supported the ABA-signalling and carbohydrate metabolism results, and revealed some pronounced biological process GO categories associated with the cold-shock response of the genotypes. Protein network analysis indicated differences between the genotypes in the information flow along their signal perception and transduction, suggesting different biochemical and cellular strategies in their reaction to cold-shock."

"28058637","abstracttext","Identification of bacteria that produce carbohydrolytic enzymes is extremely important given the increased demand for these enzymes in many industries. Twenty lignocellulose-degrading bacterial isolates from Algerian compost and different soils were screened for their potential to produce different enzymes involved in biomass deconstruction. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolates belonged to Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. Differences among species were reflected both as the presence/absence of enzymes or at the level of enzyme activity. Among the most active species, Bosea sp. FBZP-16 demonstrated cellulolytic activity on both amorphous cellulose (CMC) and complex lignocellulose (wheat straw) and was selected for whole-genomic sequencing. The genome sequencing revealed the presence of a complex enzymatic machinery required for organic matter decomposition. Analysis of the enzyme-encoding genes indicated that multiple genes for endoglucanase, xylanase, β-glucosidase and β-mannosidase are present in the genome with enzyme activities displayed by the bacterium, while other enzymes, such as certain cellobiohydrolases, were not detected at the genomic level. This indicates that a combination of functional screening of bacterial cultures with the use of genome-derived information is important for the prediction of potential enzyme production. These results provide insight into their possible exploitation for the production of fuels and chemicals derived from plant biomass."

"28063194","abstracttext","Horizontal gene transfer can precipitate rapid evolutionary change. In 2010 the global pandemic of kiwifruit canker disease caused by Pseudomonas syringae pv. actinidiae (Psa) reached New Zealand. At the time of introduction, the single clone responsible for the outbreak was sensitive to copper, however, analysis of a sample of isolates taken in 2015 and 2016 showed that a quarter were copper resistant. Genome sequences of seven strains showed that copper resistance - comprising czc/cusABC and copABCD systems - along with resistance to arsenic and cadmium, was acquired via uptake of integrative conjugative elements (ICEs), but also plasmids. Comparative analysis showed ICEs to have a mosaic structure, with one being a tripartite arrangement of two different ICEs and a plasmid that were isolated in 1921 (USA), 1968 (NZ) and 1988 (Japan), from P. syringae pathogens of millet, wheat and kiwifruit respectively. Two of the Psa ICEs were nearly identical to two ICEs isolated from kiwifruit leaf colonists prior to the introduction of Psa into NZ. Additionally, we show ICE transfer in vitro and in planta, analyze fitness consequences of ICE carriage, capture the de novo formation of novel recombinant ICEs, and explore ICE host-range."

"29205864","abstracttext","A new cellulolytic strain of Chryseobacterium genus was screened from the dung of a cattle fed with cereal straw. A putative cellulase gene (cbGH5) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 5 subfamily 46 (GH5_46) was identified and cloned by degenerate PCR plus genome walking. The CbGH5 protein was overexpressed in Pichia pastoris, purified and characterized. It is the first bifunctional cellulase-xylanase reported in GH5_46 as well as in Chryseobacterium genus. The enzyme showed an endoglucanase activity on carboxymethylcellulose of 3237 μmol min -1  mg -1 at pH 9, 90 °C and a xylanase activity on birchwood xylan of 1793 μmol min -1  mg -1 at pH 8, 90 °C. The activity level and thermophilicity are in the front rank of all the known cellulases and xylanases. Core hydrophobicity had a positive effect on the thermophilicity of this enzyme. When similar quantity of enzymatic activity units was applied on the straws of wheat, rice, corn and oilseed rape, CbGH5 could obtain 3.5-5.0× glucose and 1.2-1.8× xylose than a mixed commercial cellulase plus xylanase of Novozymes. When applied on spent mushroom substrates made from the four straws, CbGH5 could obtain 9.2-15.7× glucose and 3.5-4.3× xylose than the mixed Novozymes cellulase+xylanase. The results suggest that CbGH5 could be a promising candidate for industrial lignocellulosic biomass conversion."

"29302301","abstracttext","Centromeres are essential for correct chromosome segregation during cell division and are determined by the presence of centromere-specific histone 3 (CENH3). Most of the diploid plant species, in which the structure and copy number of CENH3 genes have been determined, have this gene as a singleton; however, some cereal species in the tribe Triticeae have been found to have CENH3 in two variants. In this work, using the set of the wheat-rye addition lines we wanted to establish the chromosomal assignment of the CENH3 genes in the cultivated rye, Secale cereale (Linnaeus, 1753), in order to expand our knowledge about synteny conservation in the most important cereal species and about their chromosome evolution. To this end, we have also analyzed data in available genome sequencing databases. As a result, the αCENH3 and βCENH3 forms have been assigned to rye chromosomes 1R and 6R: specifically, the commonest variants αCENH3v1 and βCENH3v1 to chromosome 1R, and the rare variants, αCENH3v2 and probably βCENH3v2, to chromosome 6R. No other CENH3 variants have been found by analysis of the rye genome sequencing databases. Our chromosomal assignment of CENH3 in rye has been found to be the same as that in barley, suggesting that both main forms of CENH3 appeared in a Triticeae species before the barley and wheatrye lineages split."

"29472693","abstracttext","The applications of semi-dwarf genes such as sd1 and Rht1 in rice and wheat resulted in the first ""green revolution"" in the 1960s. However, such semi-dwarf genes that can efficiently reduce plant stature and have few negative yield traits have not yet been identified in maize. In this study, a new allele of Brachytic2 gene (qpa1) encoding P-glycoprotein was rapidly fine-mapped using a modified method. The qpa1, containing a 241-bp deletion in the last exon, had no negative effect on yield, but greatly modified the plant architecture including significantly reduced plant height and ear height, increased stalk diameter and erected leaf. A common variant similar to maize qpa1 was also present in the sorghum orthologous dw3 locus. Comparative RNA-seq analysis next showed 99 differentially co-expressed genes affected by Br2 in maize and dw3 in sorghum, including four plant height genes D3, BAK1, Actin7 and Csld1, which are involved in gibberellin and brassinosteroid biosynthesis, auxin transport and cellulose synthesis. The qpa1 can be applied to efficiently modify plant stature in maize and in combination with D3, BAK1, Actin7, Csld1 and the other 95 differentially co-expressed genes, can be edited using new genomic editing tools for further applications and studies."

"29453757","abstracttext","Spermatogenesis starts within the seminiferous tubules of the testis by mitotic division of spermatogonia that produces spermatocytes. Meiotic division of these spermatocytes produces haploid spermatids that differentiate into spermatozoa. In this study, we examined the expression of ENaC and CFTR (a Cl - channel) in rat testicular sections using confocal microscopic immunofluorescence. The structural integrity of the seminiferous tubule sections was verified by precise phalloidin staining of the actin fibers located abundantly at both basal and adluminal tight junctions. The acrosome forming regions in the round spermatids were stained using an FITC coupled lectin (wheat germ agglutinin). In all phases of the germ cells (spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids) ENaC was localized in cytoplasmic pools. Prior to spermiation, ENaC immunofluorescence appeared along the tails of the spermatids. In spermatozoa isolated from the epididymis, ENaC was localized at the acrosome and a central region of the sperm flagellum. The mature sperm are transcriptionally silent. Hence, we suggest that ENaC subunits in cytoplasmic pools in germ cells serve as the source of ENaC subunits located along the tail of spermatozoa. The locations of ENaC is compatible with a possible role in the acrosomal reaction and sperm mobility. In contrast to ENaC, CFTR immunofluorescence was most strongly observed specifically within the Sertoli cell nuclei. Based on the nuclear localization of CFTR we suggest that, in addition to its role as an ion channel, CFTR may have an independent role in gene regulation within the nuclei."

These enzymes have applications in various industries such as pulp and paper, laundry, food and feed, textile, brewing industry and in biofuel production. In the present study we have cloned acid-cellulase gene (Cel-1) from the fosmid library of buffalo rumen metagenomic DNA and functionally expressed it in Escherichia coli. The ORF encoding cellulase consisted of 1176-bp, corresponding to protein of 391 amino acid and has catalytic domain belonging to glycosyl hydrolase family 5. The purified protein has a molecular weight of 43-kDa on SDS-PAGE and its expression was confirmed by western blotting. The tertiary structure of the cellulase (Cel-1) showed a classical (α/β) TIM-like barrel motif. Model surface charge of Cel-1 predicted that surface near active site was mostly negative which might be responsible for the stability of enzyme at lower pH. The pH and temperature for maximum enzyme activity were 4.5 and 45°C respectively. Various metal ions enhanced the enzyme activity and in presence of Mn +2 activity was significantly increased. Cel-1 hydrolyzed pre-treated wheat straw and released reducing sugars (62.60%). These desirable properties of Cel-1 make it attractive for the bioconversion of biomass."
"29456548","articletitle","GABA Shunt in Durum Wheat."
"29456548","abstracttext","Plant responses to salinity are complex, especially when combined with other stresses, and involve many changes in gene expression and metabolic fluxes. Until now, plant stress studies have been mainly dealt only with a single stress approach. However, plants exposed to multiple stresses at the same time, a combinatorial approach reflecting real-world scenarios, show tailored responses completely different from the response to the individual stresses, due to the stress-related plasticity of plant genome and to specific metabolic modifications. In this view, recently it has been found that γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) but not glycine betaine (GB) is accumulated in durum wheat plants under salinity only when it is combined with high nitrate and high light. In these conditions, plants show lower reactive oxygen species levels and higher photosynthetic efficiency than plants under salinity at low light. This is certainly relevant because the most of drought or salinity studies performed on cereal seedlings have been done in growth chambers under controlled culture conditions and artificial lighting set at low light. However, it is very difficult to interpret these data. To unravel the reason of GABA accumulation and its possible mode of action, in this review, all possible roles for GABA shunt under stress are considered, and an additional mechanism of action triggered by salinity and high light suggested."

"29171909","abstracttext","Phytophthora palmivora is a devastating oomycete plant pathogen. We found that P. palmivora induces disease in Lotus japonicus and used this interaction to identify cellular and molecular events in response to this oomycete, which has a broad host range. Transcript quantification revealed that Lys12 was highly and rapidly induced during P. palmivora infection. Mutants of Lys12 displayed accelerated disease progression, earlier plant death and a lower level of defence gene expression than the wild type, while the defence program after chitin, laminarin, oligogalacturonide or flg22 treatment and the root symbioses with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhiza were similar to the wild type. On the microbial side, we found that P. palmivora encodes an active chitin synthase-like protein, and mycelial growth is impaired after treatment with a chitin-synthase inhibitor. However, wheat germ agglutinin-detectable N-acetyl-glucosamine (GlcNAc) epitopes were not identified when the oomycete was grown in vitro or while infecting the roots. This indicates that conventional GlcNAc-mers are unlikely to be produced and/or accumulate in P. palmivora cell walls and that LYS12 might perceive an unknown carbohydrate. The impact of Lys12 on progression of root rot disease, together with the finding that similar genes are present in other P. palmivora hosts, suggests that LYS12 might mediate a common early response to this pathogen."

We report findings of a first attempt to identify genomic regions with stable expression and their individual epistatic interactions for grain yield and yield stability in a large elite panel of wheat under multiple environments via a genome wide association mapping (GWAM) approach. Seven hundred and twenty lines were genotyped using genotyping-by-sequencing technology and phenotyped for grain yield and phenological traits. High gene diversity (0.250) and a moderate genetic structure (five groups) in the panel provided an excellent base for GWAM. The mixed linear model and multi-locus mixed model analyses identified key genomic regions on chromosomes 2B, 3A, 4A, 5B, 7A and 7B. Further, significant epistatic interactions were observed among loci with and without main effects that contributed to additional variation of up to 10%. Simple stepwise regression provided the most significant main effect and epistatic markers resulting in up to 20% variation for yield stability and up to 17% gain in yield with the best allelic combination."

"28330308","abstracttext","Aspergillus niger is an important microorganism that has been used for decades to produce extracellular enzymes. In this study, a novel Aspergillus niger strain integrated with a eukaryotic expression vector harboring the gpd-Shi promoter of shiitake mushrooms and cellulase gene of Ampullaria gigas Spix was engineered to improve cellulase production for the achievement of highly efficient saccharification of agricultural residues. In one strain, designated ACShi27, which exhibited the highest total cellulase expression, total cellulase, endoglucanase, exoglucanase, and xylanase expression levels were 1.73, 16.23, 17.73, and 150.83 U ml -1 , respectively; these values were 14.5, 22.3, 24.6, and 17.3% higher than those of the wild-type Aspergillus niger M85 using wheat bran as an induction substrate. Production of cellulases and xylanase by solid-state fermentation followed by in situ saccharification of ACShi27 was investigated with alkaline-pretreated rice straw as a substrate. After 2 days of enzyme induction at 30 °C, followed by 48 h of saccharification at 50 °C, the conversion rate of carbon polymers into reducing sugar reached 293.2 mg g -1 , which was 1.23-fold higher than that of the wild-type strain. The expression of sestc in Aspergillus niger can improve the total cellulase and xylanase activity and synergism, thereby enhancing the lignocellulose in situ saccharification."

"28324331","abstracttext","Seaweed is a highly attractive marine crop for the production of biofuels, due to its rapid growth rate as well as high polysaccharide and low lignin content. One appealing exploitation route is the production of biogas by anaerobic digestion. Interestingly, despite the compositional differences between seaweed and lignocellulosic biomass, available data indicate that conditions and inocula traditionally used for the latter may work well for seaweed. To gain more insight into the underlying microbial processes, we have generated 16S rRNA gene amplicon pyrosequencing data to comparatively describe microbial communities in biogas digesters containing either the seaweed Saccharina latissima or wheat straw. The seaweed digesters gave better biogas yield and a higher relative abundance of core group Methanosaeta-affiliated Archaea. Conversely, variation in biomass had only minor abundance effects towards dominant bacterial lineages and influenced only low-abundant bacterial OTUs. Affiliations between dominant archaeal and bacterial phylotypes described here and previously identified anaerobic digestion core groups indicate that trends are beginning to emerge within these newly explored microbial ecosystems, the understanding of which is currently impeded by limited published datasets."

"28383077","abstracttext","Severe water deficit (SD) severely limited the photo-assimilate supply during the grain-filling stages. Although the ethylene and polyamines (PAs) have been identified as important signaling molecules involved in stress tolerance, it is yet unclear how 1-Aminocylopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) and PA biosynthesis involving wheat abdominal phloem characters mitigate SD-induced filling inhibition. The results obtained indicated that the SD down-regulated the TaSUT1 expression and decreased the activities of sucrose synthase (SuSase, EC2.4.1.13), ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase, EC2.7.7.27), soluble starch synthase (SSSase, EC2.4.1.21), then substantially limited grain filling. As a result, increased ACC and putrescine (Put) concentrations and their biosynthesis-related gene expression reduced spermidine (Spd) biosynthesis under SD condition. And, the ACC and PA biosynthesis in inferior grains was more sensitive to SD than that in superior grains. Intermediary cells (ICs) of caryopsis emerged prematurely under SD to compensate for the weakened photo-assimilate transport functions of sieve elements (SEs). Finally, plasmolysis and nuclear chromatin condensation of phloem parenchyma cells (PPC) and membrane degradation of SEs, as well as the decreased ATPase activity on plasma membranes of ICs and PPC at the later filling stage under SD were responsible for the considerably decreased weight of inferior grains."

"28261228","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight, caused by Fusarium graminearum , is one of the most severe diseases on wheat and barley worldwide. Although the genomic data of several strains were published, the intragenomic variation of F. graminearum was not well characterized. Here, we sequenced three Chinese strains and conducted genome-wide comparisons. Our data revealed that all the sequenced strains were distinct from each other and over 350 genes were functionally lost in each of them. Variants of each strain were unevenly distributed in a highly conserved pattern along the chromosomes, resulting in a conserved two-speed genome. The fast subgenome has a lower GC content, shorter gene length, and higher variation of exon numbers than the slow subgenome. Genes related to interaction and pathogenicity, under positive selection, and up-regulated in planta were all significantly enriched in the fast subgenome. Furthermore, we found that the fast subgenome coincided with facultative heterochromatin regions that were repressed in vegetative stage but activated during infection as measured by RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, suggesting that the fast subgenome is epigenetically regulated. Taken together, our data demonstrated that F. graminearum has a highly conserved two-speed genome and the fast subgenome responsible for adaption and infection is under the control of heterochromatin."

"28256553","abstracttext","CRISPR/Cas9 is a powerful genome editing tool that has been extensively used in model plants and crops, such as Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, wheat, and soybean. Here, we report the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to precisely knock out the committed diterpene synthase gene (SmCPS1) involved in tanshinone biosynthesis in Salvia miltiorrhiza, a traditional Chinese medicinal herb with significant pharmacological activities, such as vasorelaxation, protection against ischemia-reperfusion injury, and antiarrhythmic effects. Three homozygous and eight chimeric mutants were obtained from 26 independent transgenic hairy root lines by Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated transformation. The metabolomic analysis based on LC-qTOF-MS and Q-TRAP-LC-MS/MS revealed that tanshinones, especially cryptotanshinone, tanshinone IIA and tanshinone I, are completely missing in homozygous mutants, without influencing other phenolic acid metabolites. By contrast, tanshinones are decreased but still detectable in chimeric mutants, which is similar to a previously-reported an RNAi study of SmCPS1. These results demonstrate that Agrobacterium rhizogenes- mediated transformation using CRISPR/Cas9 is a simple and efficient genome editing tool in S. miltiorrhiza, thus paving the way for large-scale genome editing in S. miltiorrhiza, which is important for pathway elucidation of secondary metabolites, quality improvement, and yield increases for this valuable traditional Chinese medicinal herb."

"28238910","abstracttext","For saccharifying starch in one step, a chimeric biocatalyst (Amy-Glu) was generated from engineered α-amylase (Ba-Gt-amy) of Bacillus acidicola and glucoamylase (Glu) gene of Aspergillus niger. In order to join two enzymes, a linker peptide of 25 amino acids was used. Chimeric Amy-Glu was expressed in E. coli. Glu is of 75kDa, while Amy-Glu is of 145kDa. Both Amy-Glu and Glu displayed similar pH profile with good activity in the acidic pH range like that of Ba-Gt-amy with optimum at pH 4.0. All three enzymes (Ba-Gt-amy, Amy-Glu and glucoamylase) exhibited activity in the temperature range between 40 and 70°C with optimum at 60°C. Amy-Glu and Glu have T 1/2 of 90 and 70min at 60 and 70°C, respectively. The K m , V max and K cat values of Glu (soluble starch) are 0.34mgmL -1 , 606μmolmg -1 min -1 and 727s -1 , while for Amy-Glu are 0.84mgmL -1 , 13,886μmolmg -1 min -1 and 4.2×10 4 s -1 , respectively. The end product analysis suggested that Amy-Glu retains the activity of both parental enzymes and forms maltodextrins along with glucose as the major products. Amy-Glu saccharifies wheat and corn starches more efficiently than the Ba-Gt-amy and glucoamylase."

"28212314","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) on wheat and barley. In a previous study, a GIN4-like protein kinase gene, GIL1 , was found to be important for plant infection and sexual reproduction. In this study we further characterized the functions of GIL1 kinase in different developmental processes. The Δ gil1 mutants were reduced in growth, conidiation, and virulence, and formed whitish and compact colonies. Although phialide formation was rarely observed in the mutants, deletion of GIL1 resulted in increased hyphal branching and increased tolerance to cell wall and cell membrane stresses. The Δ gil1 mutants produced straight, elongated conidia lacking of distinct foot cells and being delayed in germination. Compared with the wild type, some compartments in the vegetative hyphae of Δ gil1 mutants had longer septal distances and increased number of nuclei, suggesting GIL1 is related to cytokinesis and septation. Localization of the GIL1-GFP fusion proteins to the septum and hyphal branching and fusion sites further supported its roles in septation and branching. Overall, our results indicate that GIL1 plays a role in vegetative growth and plant infection in F. graminearum , and is involved in septation and hyphal branching."

"28790462","abstracttext","By comparing the differentially accumulated proteins from the derivatives (UC 1110 × PI 610750) in the F 10 recombinant inbred line population which differed in cold-tolerance, altogether 223 proteins with significantly altered abundance were identified. The comparison of 10 cold-sensitive descendant lines with 10 cold-tolerant descendant lines identified 140 proteins that showed decreased protein abundance, such as the components of the photosynthesis apparatus and cell-wall metabolism. The identified proteins were classified into the following main groups: protein metabolism, stress/defense, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, sulfur metabolism, nitrogen metabolism, RNA metabolism, energy production, cell-wall metabolism, membrane and transportation, and signal transduction. Results of quantitative real-time PCR of 20 differentially accumulated proteins indicated that the transcriptional expression patterns of 10 genes were consistent with their protein expression models. Virus-induced gene silencing of Hsp90, BBI, and REP14 genes indicated that virus-silenced plants subjected to cold stress had more severe drooping and wilting, an increased rate of relative electrolyte leakage, and reduced relative water content compared to viral control plants. Furthermore, ultrastructural changes of virus-silenced plants were destroyed more severely than those of viral control plants. These results indicate that Hsp90, BBI, and REP14 potentially play vital roles in conferring cold tolerance in bread wheat."

As discussed in this Review, new avenues have opened up for plant research and breeding by the use of the sequence-specific DNases Cas9 and Cas12 (formerly named Cpf1) and, more recently, the RNase Cas13 (formerly named C2c2). Although double strand break-induced gene editing based on error-prone nonhomologous end joining has been applied to obtain new traits, such as powdery mildew resistance in wheat or improved pathogen resistance and increased yield in tomato, improved technologies based on CRISPR/Cas for programmed change in plant genomes via homologous recombination have recently been developed. Cas9- and Cas12- mediated DNA binding is used to develop tools for many useful applications, such as transcriptional regulation or fluorescence-based imaging of specific chromosomal loci in plant genomes. Cas13 has recently been applied to degrade mRNAs and combat viral RNA replication. By the possibility to address multiple sequences with different guide RNAs and by the simultaneous use of different Cas proteins in a single cell, we should soon be able to achieve complex changes of plant metabolism in a controlled way."
"29576078","articletitle","Wheat expansin gene TaEXPA2 is involved in conferring plant tolerance to Cd toxicity."
"29576078","abstracttext","Cadmium (Cd) is a severe and toxic heavy metal pollutant that affects plant growth and development. In this study, we found that the expression of an expansin gene, TaEXPA2, was upregulated in wheat leaves under CdCl 2 toxicity. We characterized the involvement of TaEXPA2 in conferring Cd tolerance. Tobacco plants overexpressing TaEXPA2 showed higher germination rate, root elongation, and biomass accumulation compared to the wild-type (WT) plants upon CdCl 2 treatment. The improved photosynthetic parameters and lesser cellular damage in transgenic plants exposed to Cd compared to that in the WT plants suggest that TaEXPA2 overexpression improves Cd tolerance in plants. Furthermore, we noticed that Cd was efficiently effluxed out of the cytoplasm in the transgenic plants owing to the enhanced activities of H + -ATPase, V-ATPase, and PPase, which helped in conferring Cd tolerance. Moreover, Cd concentration and ROS accumulation were lower in the transgenic plants than in WT plants as a consequence of enhanced antioxidant enzyme activities in the former. In addition, atexpa2, an Arabidopsis mutant, exhibited lower biomass and shorter primary root compared to its WT under Cd toxicity; however, the phenotype was recovered upon expression of TaEXPA2 in these mutants. Our results demonstrate that TaEXPA2 confers tolerance to Cd toxicity. The changed absorption/transportation of Cd and the antioxidative capacity may be involved in the improved tolerance of the transgenic plants with overexpression of TaEXPA2 to CdCl 2 toxicity."

"28894236","abstracttext","Autophagy is a conserved cellular recycling and trafficking pathway in eukaryotic cells and has been reported to be important in the virulence of a number of microbial pathogens. Here, we report genome-wide identification and characterization of autophagy-related genes (ATGs) in the wheat pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum. We identified twenty-eight genes associated with the regulation and operation of autophagy in F. graminearum. Using targeted gene deletion, we generated a set of 28 isogenic mutants. Autophagy mutants were classified into two groups by differences in their growth patterns. Radial growth of 18 Group 1 ATG mutants was significantly reduced compared to the wild-type strain PH-1, while 10 Group 2 mutants grew normally. Loss of any of the ATG genes, except FgATG17, prevented the fungus from causing Fusarium head blight disease. Moreover, subsets of autophagy genes were necessary for asexual/sexual differentiation and deoxynivalenol (DON) production, respectively. FgATG1 and FgATG5 were investigated in detail and showed severe defects in autophagy. Taken together, we conclude that autophagy plays a critical role in growth, asexual/sexual sporulation, deoxynivalenol production and virulence in F. graminearum."

"29095896","abstracttext","Today, farmers in many regions of eastern Asia sow their barley grains in the spring and harvest them in the autumn of the same year (spring barley). However, when it was first domesticated in southwest Asia, barley was grown between the autumn and subsequent spring (winter barley), to complete their life cycles before the summer drought. The question of when the eastern barley shifted from the original winter habit to flexible growing schedules is of significance in terms of understanding its spread. This article investigates when barley cultivation dispersed from southwest Asia to regions of eastern Asia and how the eastern spring barley evolved in this context. We report 70 new radiocarbon measurements obtained directly from barley grains recovered from archaeological sites in eastern Eurasia. Our results indicate that the eastern dispersals of wheat and barley were distinct in both space and time. We infer that barley had been cultivated in a range of markedly contrasting environments by the second millennium BC. In this context, we consider the distribution of known haplotypes of a flowering-time gene in barley, Ppd-H1, and infer that the distributions of those haplotypes may reflect the early dispersal of barley. These patterns of dispersal resonate with the second and first millennia BC textual records documenting sowing and harvesting times for barley in central/eastern China."

"29035728","abstracttext","Xylose-assimilating pathways were constructed in the parental Pediococcus acidilactici strain and evolutionarily adapted to yield a highly stable co-fermentation strain for l-lactic acid production. The phosphoketolase pathway (PK) was blocked for reduction of acetic acid generation by disrupting phosphoketolase (pkt) gene. The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) was reconstructed for xylose assimilation by integrating four heterologous genes encoding transketolase (tkt), transaldolase (tal), xylose isomerase (xylA) and xylulokinase (xylB) into the P. acidilactici chromosome. The xylose-assimilating ability of the constructed strain was significantly improved by long term adaptive evolution. The engineered strain was applied to the simultaneous saccharification and co-fermentation (SSCF) under high solids loading of wheat straw. The l-lactic acid titer, productivity and xylose conversion reached the record high at 130.8±1.6g/L, 1.82±0.0g/L/h, and 94.9±0.0%, respectively. This study provided an important strain and process prototype for production of high titer cellulosic l-lactic acid."

"28886289","abstracttext","Saccharification potential of xylanase enzyme cloned from Bacillus licheniformis into E. coli BL21 (DE3) was evaluated against plant biomass for the production of bioethanol. The expression of cloned gene was studied and conditions were optimized for its large scale production. The parameters effecting enzyme production were examined in a fermenter. Recombinant xylanase has the ability to breakdown birchwood xylan to release xylose as well as the potential to treat plant biomass, such as wheat straw, rice straw, and sugarcane bagass. The saccharification ability of this enzyme was optimized by studying various parameters. The maximum saccharification percentage (84%) was achieved when 20 units of recombinant xylanase were used with 8% sugarcane bagass at 50°C and 120 rpm after 6 hours of incubation. The results indicated that the bioconversion of natural biomass by recombinant xylanase into simple sugars can be used for biofuel (bioethanol) production. This process can replace the use of fossil fuels, and the use of bioethanol can significantly reduce the emission of toxic gases. Future directions regarding pre-treatment of cellulosic and hemicellulosic biomass and other processes that can reduce the cost and enhance the yield of biofuels are briefly discussed."

"28846647","abstracttext","Plant-derived compounds for reducing the mycotoxin load in food and feed have become a rapidly developing research field of importance for plant breeding efforts and in the search for natural fungicides. In this study, toxigenic strains of Fusarium culmorum and F. graminearum sensu stricto were exposed to sinapic acid on solid YES media at levels close to those reported in wheat bran. Fusaria produced phenolic acids, whose accumulation was decreased by exogenous sinapic acid. Strains exposed to the lowest doses of sinapic acid showed more efficient reduction of phenolic acid production than fungi kept at higher concentrations of this compound. Fungi reduced exogenous sinapic acid, leading to the formation of syringic aldehyde. Treatment with sinapic acid led to a dramatic accumulation of its parent compound ferulic acid, presumably due to inhibition of the further conversion of this phenolic compound. Exogenous sinapic acid decreased the production of trichothecenes by fungi. Higher doses of sinapic acid resulted in more efficient reduction of mycotoxin accumulation in the media. Gene expression studies of Tri genes responsible for trichothecene biosynthesis ( Tri4 , Tri5 and Tri10 ) proved that the inhibition of mycotoxin production by sinapic acid occurred at the transcriptional level. Fusaria respond to sinapic acid by stimulation of ergosterol biosynthesis."

A collection of ten tetraploid (Solanum tuberosum) and diploid (S. phureja and S. chacoense) genotypes with contrasting carotenoid content was subjected to molecular characterization with respect to candidate carotenoid loci and metabolic profiling using LC-HRMS. Irrespective of ploidy and taxonomy, tubers of these genotypes fell into three groups: yellow-fleshed, characterized by high levels of epoxy-xanthophylls and xanthophyll esters and by the presence of at least one copy of a dominant allele of the β-Carotene Hydroxylase 2 (CHY2) gene; white-fleshed, characterized by low carotenoid levels and by the presence of recessive chy2 alleles; and orange-fleshed, characterized by high levels of zeaxanthin but low levels of xanthophyll esters, and homozygosity for a Zeaxanthin Epoxidase (ZEP) recessive allele. Novel CHY2 and ZEP alleles were identified in the collection. Multivariate analysis identified several groups of co-regulated non-polar compounds, and resulted in the grouping of the genotypes according to flesh color, suggesting that extensive cross-talk exists between the carotenoid pathway and other metabolite pathways in tubers. Postharvest traits like tuber dormancy and weight loss during storage showed little correlation with tuber carotenoid content, with the exception of zeaxanthin and its esters. Other tuber metabolites, such as glucose, monogalactosyldiacyglycerol (a glycolipid), or suberin precursors, showed instead significant correlations with both traits."

"28913805","abstracttext","Despite the unceasing advances in genetic transformation techniques, the success of common delivery methods still lies on the behavior of the integrated transgenes in the host genome. Stability and expression of the introduced genes are influenced by several factors such as chromosomal location, transgene copy number and interaction with the host genotype. Such factors are traditionally characterized by Southern blot analysis, which can be time-consuming, laborious, and often unable to detect the exact copy number of rearranged transgenes. Recent research in crop field suggests real-time PCR as an effective and reliable tool for the precise quantification and characterization of transgene loci. This technique overcomes most problems linked to phenotypic segregation analysis and can analyze hundreds of samples in a day, making it an efficient method for estimating a gene copy number integrated in a transgenic line. This protocol describes the use of real-time PCR for the detection of transgene copy number in durum wheat transgenic lines by means of two different chemistries (SYBR ® Green I dye and TaqMan ® probes)."

The global prebiotics market is expected to grow around 12.7% in the next 8 years, so manufacturers are developing new alternatives to obtain sustainable and efficient processes for application on a large scale. Most studied examples of biotechnological processes involve the development of new strategies for fructooligosaccharide, galactooligosaccharide, xylooligosaccharide, and mannanooligosaccharide synthesis. Among these, the use of whole cells in fermentation, synthesis of microbial enzymes (β-fructofuranosidases, β-galactosidases, xylanases, and β-mannanases), and enzymatic process development (permeabilization, immobilization, gene expression) can be highlighted, especially if the production costs are reduced by the use of agro-industrial residues or by-products such as molasses, milk whey, cotton stalks, corncobs, wheat straw, poplar wood, sugarcane bagasse, and copra meal.

To identify bacteria utilizing plant-derived carbon, 13 C-CO 2 labelling of plants was performed for two weeks at the EC50 stage, followed by isopycnic density gradient centrifugation of extracted DNA from the rhizosphere combined with 16S rRNA gene-based amplicon sequencing. Our findings suggest substantially different bacterial key players and interaction mechanisms between plants and bacteria utilizing plant-derived carbon in the rhizosphere of subsoils and topsoil. Among the three soil depths, clear differences were found in 13 C enrichment pattern across abundant operational taxonomic units (OTUs). Whereas, OTUs linked to Proteobacteria were enriched in 13 C mainly in the topsoil, in both subsoil layers OTUs related to Cohnella, Paenibacillus, Flavobacterium showed a clear 13 C signal, indicating an important, so far overseen role of Firmicutes and Bacteriodetes in the subsoil rhizosphere."

Much less is known about pathogenesis involving gram-positive plant pathogens than is known for gram-negative bacteria. Comparative genome analyses of C. michiganensis subspecies affecting tomato, potato, and maize have provided insights on pathogenicity. In this study, we identified strains of C. michiganensis subsp. insidiosus with contrasting pathogenicity on three accessions of the model legume Medicago truncatula. We generated complete genome sequences for two strains and compared these to a previously sequenced strain and genome sequences of four other subspecies. The three C. michiganensis subsp. insidiosus strains varied in gene content due to genome rearrangements, most likely facilitated by insertion elements, and plasmid number, which varied from one to three depending on strain. The core C. michiganensis genome consisted of 1,917 genes, with 379 genes unique to C. michiganensis subsp. insidiosus. An operon for synthesis of the extracellular blue pigment indigoidine, enzymes for pectin degradation, and an operon for inositol metabolism are among the unique features. Secreted serine proteases belonging to both the pat-1 and ppa families were present but highly diverged from those in other subspecies."

"29127816","abstracttext","In several cases a correlation was found between polyamines and abiotic stress tolerance. However, the individual polyamines may have different effects, which also vary depending on the type of treatment. When applied as seed soaking or added hydroponically 0.5mM putrescine and spermidine, different changes were induced during 50µM cadmium stress in wheat plants. Seed-soaked plants were exposed to cadmium immediately after germination for 5 days, while plants pre-treated with polyamines hydroponically were stressed at age of 14 days for 7 days. Putrescine pre-treatment was beneficial both as seed soaking and applied hydroponically, while spermidine only had a protective effect in the case of seed soaking, enhancing the Cd-induced oxidative stress when were pre-treated hydroponically. The differences observed were related to the polyamine metabolism. The accumulation of endogenous putrescine beyond a certain amount may be in relation with the negative effect of hydroponic spermidine pre-treatment during Cd stress. The increased putrescine content was also correlated with the highest accumulation of Cd, salicylic acid and proline contents in plants treated with a combination of spermidine and Cd. However, the expression level of the gene encoding phytochelatin synthase was only influenced by hydroponically applied spermidine, which decreased it under cadmium stress. Changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, diamine and polyamine oxidases were also discussed."

"29681080","abstracttext","Drought is the most serious abiotic stress, and causes crop losses on a worldwide scale. The present study identified a previously unknown microRNA (designated as hvu-miRX) of 21 nucleotides (nt) in length in barley. Its precursor (designated pre-miRX) and primary transcript (designated pri-miRX) were also identified, with lengths of 73 and 559 nt, respectively. The identified upstream sequence of pri-miRX contained both the TATA box and the CAAT box, which are both required for initiation of transcription. Transient promoter activation assays showed that the core promoter region of pri-miRX ranged 500 nt from the transcription start site. In transgenic barley overexpression of the wheat DREB3 transcription factor (TaDREB3) caused hvu-miRX to be highly expressed as compared with the same miRNA in non-transgenic barley. However, the high expression was not directly associated with TaDREB3. Genomic analysis revealed that the hvu-miRX gene was a single copy located on the short arm of chromosome 2 and appeared to be only conserved in Triticeae, but not in other plant species. Notably, transgenic barley that overexpressed hvu-miRX showed drought tolerance.

"29797223","abstracttext","A filamentous fungus displaying high cellulase activity was isolated from a compost heap with triticale (a wheat-rye hybrid) as the main constituent. It was preliminarily identified as a Talaromyces pinophilus species. A 2577 base pair β-glucosidase gene was cloned from complementary DNA and heterologously expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The recombinant β-glucosidase production profile was assessed and compared to that of the Saccharomycopsis fibuligera β-glucosidase which served as a benchmark. The enzyme was also characterised in terms of pH and temperature tolerance as well as response to inhibitors. Maximal extracellular β-glucosidase activity of 0.56 nkat/mg total protein was measured using p-nitrophenyl-β-D-glucopyranoside as substrate. The recombinant protein displayed a pH optimum of 4.0, and good thermostability as 70% of maximal enzyme activity was retained after 1 h at 60 °C. Activity of the recombinant β-glucosidase was adversely affected by the presence of glucose and ethanol at higher concentrations while xylose had no effect. The expression of the T. pinophilus β-glucosidase did not reach the same titres as for the benchmark; however, in the context of constructing a yeast strain for bioethanol production in a consolidated bioprocess, the enzyme may still show good potential."

"29782021","abstracttext","The intimate interaction between plant host and associated microorganisms is crucial in determining plant fitness, and can foster improved tolerance to abiotic stresses and diseases. As the plant microbiome can be highly complex, low-cost, high-throughput methods such as amplicon-based sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene are often preferred for characterizing its microbial composition and diversity. However, the selection of appropriate methodology when conducting such experiments is critical for reducing biases that can make analysis and comparisons between samples and studies difficult. This protocol describes in detail a standardized methodology for the collection and extraction of DNA from soil, rhizosphere, and root samples. Additionally, we highlight a well-established 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing pipeline that allows for the exploration of the composition of bacterial communities in these samples, and can easily be adapted for other marker genes. This pipeline has been validated for a variety of plant species, including sorghum, maize, wheat, strawberry, and agave, and can help overcome issues associated with the contamination from plant organelles."

"29599791","abstracttext","Microelement contents and metabolism are vitally important for cereal plant growth and development as well as end-use properties. While minerals phytotoxicity harms plants, microelement deficiency also affects human health. Genetic engineering provides a promising way to solve these problems. As plants vary in abilities to uptake, transport, and accumulate minerals, and the key enzymes acting on that process is primarily presented in this review. Subsequently, microelement function and biosafety assessment of transgenic cereal plants have become a key issue to be addressed. Progress in genetic engineering of cereal plants has been made with the introduction of quality, high-yield, and resistant genes since the first transgenic rice, corn, and wheat were born in 1988, 1990, and 1992, respectively. As the biosafety issue of transgenic cereal plants has now risen to be a top concern, many studies on transgenic biosafety have been carried out. Transgenic cereal biosafety issues mainly include two subjects, environmental friendliness and end-use safety. Different levels of gene confirmation, genomics, proteomics, metabolomics and nutritiomics, absorption, metabolism, and function have been investigated. Also, the different levels of microelement contents have been measured in transgenic plants. Based on the motivation of the requested biosafety, systematic designs, and analysis of transgenic cereal are also presented in this review paper."

"30791213","abstracttext","α-l-Arabinofuranosidases are important in the degradation of plant polysaccharides and are used in several industrial processes. Although the use of filamentous fungi for the production of α-l-arabinofuranosidases is widely reported, there are few reports on strain engineering for enhanced production of these enzymes by fungi. In this study, the function of transcription factor AraR in l-arabinose release and catabolism by the fungus Penicillium oxalicum (P. oxalicum) is investigated. Also, a mutant of AraR, AraR A731V , is constructed to improve the production of α-l-arabinofuranosidases on the basis of the sequence homology between AraR and the xylanolytic gene activator XlnR. The AraR A731V -overexpressing strain can synthesize α-l-arabinofuranosidase in the absence of an inducer and shows a 54.1-fold increase in α-l-arabinofuranosidase production and a 7.4-fold increase in α-galactosidase production in the medium containing wheat bran. Determination of the transcript abundances of lignocellulolytic enzyme genes reveals significant upregulation of multiple α-l-arabinofuranosidase genes and downregulation of some cellulolytic and xylanolytic enzyme genes in the engineered strain relative to its parent. Taken together, the results suggest the conserved regulatory function of AraR in the family Trichocomaceae and provide a strategy for engineering fungal strains for enhanced α- l-arabinofuranosidase production."

"31065709","abstracttext","The grains that form the basis of most commercial chicken diets are rich in cellulose, an unbranched β-1,4-linked D-glucopyranose polymer, used as a structural molecule in plants. Although it is a predominant polysaccharide in cereal hulls, it is considered an inert non-fermentable fiber. The aim of the current study was to analyze the effect of in-feed supplementation of cellulose on the gut microbiota composition of broilers. Administration of cellulose to chickens, on top of a wheat-based diet, changed the caecal microbiota composition, as determined using pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. At day 26, a significantly (P < 0.01) higher relative abundance of the Alistipes genus was observed in the caeca of broilers fed the cellulose-supplemented diet, compared to animals fed the control diet. An in vitro batch fermentation assay showed a significant (P < 0.01) growth stimulation of Alistipes finegoldii in the presence of cellulose. In conclusion, in-feed supplementation of cellulose alters the microbiota composition at the level of the phylum Bacteroidetes, specifically the Alistipes genus. This suggests that cellulose is not essentially inert but can alter the gut micro-environment."

"31156596","abstracttext","Bacteria belonging to the Pseudomonas genus are highly successful colonizers of the plant rhizosphere. The ability of different Pseudomonas species to live either commensal lifestyles or to act as agents of plant-growth promotion or disease is reflected in a large, highly flexible accessory genome. Nevertheless, adaptation to the plant environment involves a commonality of phenotypic outputs such as changes to motility, coupled with synthesis of nutrient uptake systems, stress-response molecules and adherence factors including exopolysaccharides. Cyclic-di-GMP (cdG) is a highly important second messenger involved in the integration of environmental signals with appropriate adaptive responses and is known to play a central role in mediating effective rhizosphere colonization. In this study, we examined the transcription of multiple, reportedly plant-upregulated cdG metabolism genes during colonization of the wheat rhizosphere by the plant-growth-promoting strain P. fluorescens SBW25. While transcription of the tested genes generally increased in the rhizosphere environment, we additionally observed a tightly orchestrated response to environmental cues, with a distinct transcriptional pattern seen for each gene throughout the colonization process. Extensive phenotypical analysis of deletion and overexpression strains was then conducted and used to propose cellular functions for individual cdG signaling genes. Finally, in-depth genetic analysis of an important rhizosphere colonization regulator revealed a link between cdG control of growth, motility and stress response, and the carbon sources available in the rhizosphere."

"30770359","abstracttext","Low temperatures are required to regulate the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth via a pathway called vernalization. In wheat, vernalization predominantly involves the cold upregulation of the floral activator VERNALIZATION1 ( VRN1 ). Here, we have used an extreme vernalization response, identified through studying ambient temperature responses, to reveal the complexity of temperature inputs into VRN-A1 , with allelic inter-copy variation at a gene expansion of VRN-A1 modulating these effects. We find that the repressors of the reproductive transition, VERNALIZATION2 ( VRN2 ) and ODDSOC2 , are re-activated when plants experience high temperatures during and after vernalization. In addition, this re-activation is regulated by photoperiod for VRN2 but was independent of photoperiod for ODDSOC2 We also find this warm temperature interruption affects flowering time and floret number and is stage specific. This research highlights the important balance between floral activators and repressors in coordinating the response of a plant to temperature, and that the absence of warmth is essential for the completion of vernalization. This knowledge can be used to develop agricultural germplasm with more predictable vernalization responses that will be more resilient to variable growth temperatures."

"30863378","abstracttext","Fusarium oxysporum is a leading microbial agent in the emerging consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) industry owing to its capability to infiltrate the plant's lignin barrier and degrade complex carbohydrates to value-added chemicals such as bioethanol in a single step. Membrane transport of nutrients is a key factor in successful microbial colonization of host tissue. This study assessed the impact of a peptide transporter on F. oxysporum's ability to convert lignocellulosic straw to ethanol. We characterized a novel F. oxysporum peptide transporter ( FoPTR2 ) of the dipeptide/tripeptide transporter (PTR) class. FoPTR2 represents a novel transporter with high homology to the Trichoderma sp. peptide transporters ThPTR2 and TrEST-AO793 . Its expression level was highly activated in nitrogen-poor environments, which is a characteristic of PTR class peptide transporters. Overexpression and post-translational gene silencing of the FoPTR2 in F. oxysporum affected the peptide transport capacity and ethanol yielded from a both a wheat straw/bran mix and glucose. Thus, we conclude that it FoPTR2 plays a role in the nutrient acquisition system of F. oxysporum which serves to not only enhance fungal fitness but also CBP efficacy."

"30927052","abstracttext","Ubiquitinated biosynthetic and surface proteins destined for degradation are sorted into the lysosome/vacuole via the multivesicular body sorting pathway, which depends on the function of ESCRT machinery. Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum is one of the most devastating diseases for wheat and barley worldwide. To better understand the role of ESCRT machinery in F. graminearum, we investigated the function of ESCRT-III accessory proteins FgVps60, FgDid2 and FgIst1 in this study. FgVps60-GFP, FgDid2-GFP and FgIst1-GFP are localized to punctate structures adjacent to the vacuolar membrane except for FgIst1-GFP that is also found in the nucleus. Then, the gene deletion mutants ΔFgvps60, ΔFgdid2 and ΔFgist1 displayed defective growth to a different extent. ΔFgvps60 and ΔFgdid2 but not ΔFgist1 also showed significant reduction in hydrophobicity on cell surface, conidiation, perithecia production and virulence. Interestingly, ΔFgist1 mutant produced a significantly higher level of DON while showing a minor reduction in pathogenicity. Microscopic analyses revealed that FgVps60 but not FgIst1 and FgDid2 is necessary for endocytosis. Moreover, spontaneous mutations were identified in the ΔFgvps60 mutant that partially rescued its defects in growth and conidiation. Taken together, we conclude that ESCRT-III accessory proteins play critical roles in growth, reproduction and plant infection in F. graminearum."

"31214156","abstracttext","Heterodera avenae mainly infects cereal crops and causes severe economic losses. Many studies have shown that parasitic nematodes can secrete effector proteins to suppress plant immune responses and then promote parasitism. In this study, we showed that HaGland5, a novel effector of H. avenae , was exclusively expressed in dorsal esophageal gland cell of nematode, and up-regulated in the early parasitic stage. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing HaGland5 were significantly more susceptible to H. schachtii than wild-type control plants. Conversely, silencing of HaGland5 through barley stripe mosaic virus-medicated host-induced gene silencing technique substantially reduced the infection of H. avenae in wheat. Moreover, HaGland5 could suppress the plant defense responses, including the repression of plant defense-related genes, reducing deposition of cell wall callose and the burst of reactive oxygen species. Mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation, and firefly luciferase complementation imaging assays confirmed that HaGland5 interacted specifically with Arabidopsis pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit (AtEMB3003)."

"32207931","abstracttext","The environmental spread of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) from the land application of livestock wastes can be a potential public health threat. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of setback distance, which determines how close manure may be applied in relation to surface water, on the transport of antibiotics and ARGs in runoff and soil following land application of swine manure slurry. Rainfall simulation tests were conducted on field plots covered with wheat residues, each of which contained an upslope manure region where slurry was applied and an adjacent downslope setback region that did not receive slurry. Results show that all three antibiotics (chlortetracycline, lincomycin, and tiamulin) and seven out of the ten genes tested ( erm (B), erm (C), intI1 , tet (O), tet (Q), tet (X), and the 16S rRNA gene) decreased significantly in runoff with increased setback distance. Only bla TEM , chlortetracycline, and tiamulin decreased significantly in surface soil with increased setback distance, while the other analytes did not exhibit statistically significant trends. By using linear regression models with field data, we estimate that a setback distance between 34-67 m may allow manure-borne antibiotics and ARGs in runoff to reach background levels under the experimental conditions tested."
"32128617","articletitle","Molecular genetics of leaf rust resistance in wheat and barley."
"32128617","abstracttext","The demand for cereal grains as a main source of energy continues to increase due to the rapid increase in world population. The leaf rust diseases of cereals cause significant yield losses, posing challenges for global food security. The deployment of resistance genes has long been considered as the most effective and sustainable way to control cereal leaf rust diseases. While genetic resistance has reduced the impact of these diseases in agriculture, losses still occur due to the ability of the respective rust pathogens to change and render resistance genes ineffective plus the slow pace at which resistance genes are discovered and characterized. This article highlights novel recently developed strategies based on advances in genome sequencing that have accelerated gene isolation by overcoming the complexity of cereal genomes. The leaf rust resistance genes cloned so far from wheat and barley belong to various protein families, including nucleotide binding site/leucine-rich repeat receptors and transporters. We review recent studies that are beginning to reveal the defense mechanisms conferred by the leaf rust resistance genes identified to date in cereals and their roles in either pattern-triggered immunity or effector-triggered immunity."
"32161600","articletitle","Natural Selection Towards Wild-Type in Composite Cross Populations of Winter Wheat."
"32161600","abstracttext","Most of our crops are grown in monoculture with single genotypes grown over wide acreage. An alternative approach, where segregating populations are used as crops, is an exciting possibility, but outcomes of natural selection upon this type of crop are not well understood. We tracked allelic frequency changes in evolving composite cross populations of wheat grown over 10 generations under organic and conventional farming. At three generations, each population was genotyped with 19 SSR and 8 SNP markers. The latter were diagnostic for major functional genes. Gene diversity was constant at SSR markers but decreased over time for SNP markers. Population differentiation between the four locations could not be detected, suggesting that organic vs. non-organic crop management did not drive allele frequency changes. However, we did see changes for genes controlling plant height and phenology in all populations independently and consistently. We interpret these changes as the result of a consistent natural selection towards wild-type. Independent selection for alleles that are associated with plant height suggests that competition for light was central, resulting in the predominance of stronger intraspecific competitors, and highlighting a potential trade-off between individual and population performance."

"32199966","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON), a toxic secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium species that mainly infests cereals such as wheat and corn, threatens human and livestock health. The present study describes the characterization of a novel bacterial strain, Pelagibacterium halotolerans ANSP101 which is capable of transforming DON to less-toxic product 3-keto-deoxynivalenol by the oxidation of the C3 hydroxyl group. Strain ANSP101 was isolated from a seawater sample from a depth of 55 m in Chinese Bohai sea. The strain was identified as Pelagibacterium halotolerans by morphology characterization and 16S rDNA gene sequencing. The DON degrading activity of strain ANSP101 was predominantly attributed to the bacterial cell lysate. Besides, the cell lysate was sensitive to sodium dodecyl sulfate, heat, and proteinase K treatment, indicating that the intracellular proteins or enzymes are responsible for the DON degradation. The optimal temperature and pH for the maximal degradation of DON were 40 °C and pH 8.0 by the cell lysate. These results provide the potential use of P. halotolerans ANSP101 as a detoxification agent for DON decontamination in cereals and feed."

"32314918","abstracttext","In this study, we investigated the effect of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) on gluten quality and glutenin synthesis based on the cytological, physicochemical, and transcriptional levels using Xinong1718 and its three near-isogenic lines (NILs). Cytological observations showed that the endosperm of Glu-1Bh with Bx14+By15 accumulated more abundant and larger protein bodies at 10 and 16 days after anthesis than the other NILs. Glu-1Bh exhibited higher nitrogen metabolism enzyme gene expression and activity levels. The transcriptional levels of genes encoding HMW-GSs, protein folding, and transcription factors differed significantly among the NILs, and they were highest in Glu-1Bh. Our results demonstrate that variations in the expression patterns of nitrogen metabolism and glutenin synthesis-related genes may account for the differences in the accumulation of glutenin, glutenin macropolymers, and protein bodies, thereby affecting the structural and thermal stability of gluten. These findings provide novel insights into how different HMW-GSs might improve the quality of wheat."

"32389313","abstracttext","Circadian clocks are autonomous timers that are believed to confer organisms a selective advantage by enabling processes to occur at appropriate times of the day. In the model fungus Neurospora crassa, 20-40 % of its genes are reported to be under circadian regulation, as assayed in simple sugar media. Although it has been well-described that Neurospora efficiently deconstructs plant cell wall components, little is known regarding the status of the clock when Neurospora grows on cellulosic material, or whether such a clock has an impact on any of the genes involved in this process. Through luciferase-based reporters and fluorescent detection assays, we show that a clock is functioning when Neurospora grows on cellulose-containing wheat straw as the only carbon and nitrogen source. Additionally, we found that the major cellobiohydrolase encoding gene involved in plant cell wall deconstruction, cbh-1, is rhythmically regulated by the Neurospora clock, in a manner that depends on cellulose concentration and on the transcription factor CRE-1, known as a key player in carbon-catabolite repression in this fungus. Our findings are a step towards a more comprehensive understanding on how clock regulation modulates cellulose degradation, and thus Neurospora's physiology."

All seeds were ultra-dried to 3%-5% moisture before being sealed in glass tubes. Germination tests were performed in accordance with the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) protocols. At the initiation of the experiment, the samples showed good germination with the median value at 92%. The overall picture remained stable over the first twenty to twenty-five years. However, the variation became larger over time and at 30 years, the median value had dropped to 80%. At the lower end, with a high drop in germination, we found rye, wheat, and English ryegrass. At the upper end, we found Kentucky bluegrass and cucumber. The lowest germination was found in samples with the highest initial seed moisture levels. Pre-storage conditions are likely to be of major importance for longevity."

"32573650","abstracttext","Modulation of traits beneficial for cultivation and yield is one of the main goals of crop improvement. One of the targets for enhancing productivity is changing the architecture of inflorescences since in many species it determines fruit and seed yield. Inflorescence shape and organization is genetically established during the early stages of reproductive development and depends on the number, arrangement, activities, and duration of meristems during the reproductive phase of the plant life cycle. Despite the variety of inflorescence architectures observable in nature, many key aspects of inflorescence development are conserved among different species. For instance, the genetic network in charge of specifying the identity of the different reproductive meristems, which can be indeterminate or determinate, seems to be similar among distantly related species. The availability of a large number of published transcriptomic datasets for plants with different inflorescence architectures, allowed us to identify transcription factor gene families that are differentially expressed in determinate and indeterminate reproductive meristems. The data that we review here for Arabidopsis, rice, barley, wheat, and maize, particularly deepens our knowledge of their involvement in meristem identity specification."

"32459309","abstracttext","Drought impairs growth and spike development and is therefore a major cause of yield losses in the temperate cereals barley and wheat. Here, we show that the photoperiod response gene PHOTOPERIOD-H1 (Ppd-H1) interacts with drought stress signals to modulate spike development. We tested the effects of a continuous mild and a transient severe drought stress on developmental timing and spike development in spring barley cultivars with a natural mutation in ppd-H1 and derived introgression lines carrying the wild-type Ppd-H1 allele from wild barley. Mild drought reduced the spikelet number and delayed floral development in spring cultivars but not the introgression lines with a wild-type Ppd-H1 allele. Similarly, drought-triggered reductions in plant height, tiller and spike number were more pronounced in the parental lines compared to the introgression lines. Transient severe stress halted growth and floral development, upon rewatering, introgression lines but not the spring cultivars, accelerated development so that control and stressed plants flowered almost simultaneously. These genetic differences in development were correlated with a differential downregulation of the flowering promotors FLOWERING LOCUS T1 and the BARLEY MADS-box genes BM3 and BM8. Our findings, therefore, demonstrate that Ppd-H1 affects developmental plasticity in response to drought in barley."

Under simulated maize hydrolysate, SFA1 OE produced an ethanol yield of 0.492 g/g totalsugars within 48 h. The productivity of SFA1 OE was comprehensively evaluated in typical hydrolysates from stalks of maize, sweet sorghum, wheat and Miscanthus. Within 48 h, SFA1 OE achieved an ethanol yield of 0.489 g/g totalsugars in the optimized hydrolysate of alkaline-distilled sweet sorghum bagasse derived from Advanced Solid-State Fermentation process. By crossing SFA1 OE with a DQ1-derived haploid strain, we obtained an evolved diploid strain SQ-2, exhibiting improved ethanol production and thermotolerance. This study demonstrates that overexpressing SFA1 enables efficient fermentation performance in different lignocellulosic hydrolysates, especially in the hydrolysate of alkaline-distilled sweet sorghum bagasse. The increased cellulosic bioethanol production of SFA1 OE provides a promising platform for efficient biorefineries."

"30051568","abstracttext","SR protein-specific kinases (SRPKs) uniquely with a spacer region are important splicing factors from yeast to human. However, little is known about their biological functions in filamentous fungi. Therefore, we characterized a SRPK called SRK1 in wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum. Our data showed that Srk1 is required for vegetative growth, sexual reproduction and plant infection, and plays critical roles in pre-mRNA alternative splicing and gene expression. Remarkably, we found that Srk1 displayed dynamic shuttling between cytoplasm and the nucleus, which is regulated by the divergent spacer domain rather than its kinase activity, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for Srk1. Interestingly, Srk1-GFP also localized to the septal pores, indicating a possible role of Srk1 unrelated to mRNA processing. Although both K1 and K2 lobes of the kinase domain are essential for Srk1 functions, the K2 but not K1 lobe is responsible for the septal pore localization. Lastly, we established that Srk1 physically interacts with the two SR proteins, FgNpl3 and FgSrp1. Overall, our results indicated that SRK1 regulates fungal development, plant infection and mRNA processing by phosphorylation of other splicing factors including SR proteins, and the spacer domain regulates the functions of Srk1 by modulating its nucleocytoplasmic shuttling."

"30044782","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a fungal pathogen that causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and barley. Autophagy is a highly conserved vacuolar degradation pathway essential for cellular homeostasis in which Atg9 serves as a multispanning membrane protein important for generating membranes for the formation of phagophore assembly site. However, the mechanism of autophagy or autophagosome formation in phytopathogens awaits further clarifications. In this study, we identified and characterized the Atg9 homolog (FgAtg9) in F. graminearum by live cell imaging, biochemical and genetic analyses. We find that GFP-FgAtg9 localizes to late endosomes and trans-Golgi network under both nutrient-rich and nitrogen starvation conditions and also show its dynamic actin-dependent trafficking in the cell. Further targeted gene deletion of FgATG9 demonstrates that it is important for growth, aerial hyphae development, and pathogenicity in F. graminearum. Furthermore, the deletion mutant (ΔFgatg9) shows severe defects in autophagy and lipid metabolism in response to carbon starvation. Interestingly, small GTPase FgRab7 is found to be required for the dynamic trafficking of FgAtg9, and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays show that FgAtg9 associates with FgRab7 in vivo. Finally, heterologous complementation assay shows that Atg9 is functionally conserved in F. graminearum and Magnaporthe oryzae. Taken together, we conclude that FgAtg9 is essential for autophagy-dependent development and pathogenicity of F. graminearum, which may be regulated by the small GTPase FgRab7."

The biolistic delivery of gold particles coated with plasmids expressing CRISPR/Cas9 components designed to target TaGASR7 were bombarded into SAM-exposed embryos of imbibed seeds. Bombarded embryos showing transient GFP expression within SAM were selected and grown into adult plants. Mutations in the target gene were assessed in fifth-leaf tissue by cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence analysis. Eleven (5.2%) of the 210 bombarded plants carried mutant alleles, and the mutations of three (1.4%) of these were inherited in the next generation. Genotype analysis of T 1 plants identified plants homozygous for the three homeologous genes, which were all derived from one T 0 plant. These plants showed no detectable integration of the Cas9 and guide RNA genes, indicating that transient expression of CRISPR/Cas9 introduced the mutations. Together, our current method can be used to achieve in planta genome editing in wheat using CRISPR/Cas9 and suggests possible applications to other recalcitrant plant species and variations."
"30265668","articletitle","Components of Brachypodium distachyon resistance to nonadapted wheat stripe rust pathogens are simply inherited."
"30265668","abstracttext","Phytopathogens have a limited range of host plant species that they can successfully parasitise ie. that they are adapted for. Infection of plants by nonadapted pathogens often results in an active resistance response that is relatively poorly characterised because phenotypic variation in this response often does not exist within a plant species, or is too subtle for genetic dissection. In addition, complex polygenic inheritance often underlies these resistance phenotypes and mutagenesis often does not impact upon this resistance, presumably due to genetic or mechanistic redundancy. Here it is demonstrated that phenotypic differences in the resistance response of Brachypodium distachyon to the nonadapted wheat stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) are genetically tractable and simply inherited. Two dominant loci were identified on B. distachyon chromosome 4 that each reduce attempted Pst colonisation compared with sib and parent lines without these loci. One locus (Yrr1) is effective against diverse Australian Pst isolates and present in two B. distachyon mapping families as a conserved region that was reduced to 5 candidate genes by fine mapping. A second locus, Yrr2, shows Pst race-specificity and encodes a disease resistance gene family typically associated with host plant resistance. These data indicate that some components of resistance to nonadapted pathogens are genetically tractable in some instances and may mechanistically overlap with host plant resistance to avirulent adapted pathogens."

"30535895","abstracttext","A synthetic cDNA-AmyA gene was cloned and successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris as a His-tagged enzyme under the methanol inducible AOX1 promoter. High level of extracellular amylase production of 72 U/mL was obtained after a 72 h induction by methanol. As expected, the recombinant strain produced only the AmyA isoform since the host is a protease deficient strain. Besides, the purified r-AmyA showed a molecular mass of 54 kDa, the same pH optimum equal to 5.6 but a higher thermoactivity of 60 °C against 50 °C for the native enzyme. Unlike AmyA which maintained 50% of its activity after a 10-min incubation at 60 °C, r-AmyA reached 45 min. The higher thermoactivity and thermostability could be related to the N-glycosylation. The r-AmyA activity was enhanced by 46% and 45% respectively in the presence of 4 mM Fe 2+ and Mg 2+ ions. This enzyme was more efficient in bread-making since such ions were reported to have a positive impact on the nutriment quality and the rheological characteristics of the wheat flour dough. The thermoactivity/thermostability as well as the iron and magnesium activations could also be ascribed to the presence of an additional C-terminal loop containing the His tag."

"30412827","abstracttext","Sustained cardiac hypertrophy is a major cause of heart failure (HF) and death. Recent studies have demonstrated that resveratrol (RES) exerts a protective role in hypertrophic diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully elucidated. In this study, cardiac hypertrophic remodeling in mice were established by pressure overload induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC). Cardiac function was evaluated by echocardiography and invasive pressure-volume analysis. Cardiomyocyte size was detected by wheat germ agglutinin staining. The protein and gene expressions of signaling mediators and hypertrophic markers were examined. Our results showed that administration of RES significantly suppressed pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis and apoptosis and improved in vivo heart function in mice. RES also reversed pre-established hypertrophy and restoring contractile dysfunction induced by chronic pressure overload. Moreover, RES treatment blocked TAC-induced increase of immunoproteasome activity and catalytic subunit expression (β1i, β2i and β5i), which inhibited PTEN degradation thereby leading to inactivation of AKT/mTOR and activation of AMPK signals. Further, blocking PTEN by the specific inhibitor VO-Ohpic significantly attenuated RES inhibitory effect on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our data suggest that RES is a novel inhibitor of immunoproteasome activity, and may represent a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of hypertrophic diseases."

A total of 37 strains isolated from the wheat, harvested in Serbia in 2005, 2008 and 2015, and previously designated by morphological observation as F. graminearum , were used for trichothecene genotypes characterization. The strains were identified using the species-specific primer set FG16R/FG16F while genotypic characterization was done using specific TRI13 and TRI3 sequences of the trichothecene gene clusters. The PCR assays identified all strains as species of F. graminearum sensu stricto with the DON/15-ADON genotype. The quantification of the mycotoxin (DON) was performed using the biochemical assay. The high levels of DON (>20,000 µg kg -1 ) were recorded in all of the strains from 2005, four strains from 2008 and two strains from 2015. Weather data of the investigated seasons, showed that the optimal temperature, frequent rains and high relative humidity (RH) was very favourable for the development of F. graminearum , affecting the DON biosynthesis."

"30388298","abstracttext","Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (B.g. tritici) is the causal agent of the wheat powdery mildew disease. The highly fragmented B.g. tritici genome available so far has prevented a systematic analysis of effector genes that are known to be involved in host adaptation. To study the diversity and evolution of effector genes we produced a chromosome-scale assembly of the B.g. tritici genome. The genome assembly and annotation was achieved by combining long-read sequencing with high-density genetic mapping, bacterial artificial chromosome fingerprinting and transcriptomics. We found that the 166.6 Mb B.g. tritici genome encodes 844 candidate effector genes, over 40% more than previously reported. Candidate effector genes have characteristic local genomic organization such as gene clustering and enrichment for recombination-active regions and certain transposable element families. A large group of 412 candidate effector genes shows high plasticity in terms of copy number variation in a global set of 36 isolates and of transcription levels. Our data suggest that copy number variation and transcriptional flexibility are the main drivers for adaptation in B.g. tritici. The high repeat content may play a role in providing a genomic environment that allows rapid evolution of effector genes with selection as the driving force."

"30388642","abstracttext","Silicon (Si) can alleviate cadmium (Cd) toxicity in many plants, but mechanisms underlying this beneficial effect are still lacking. In this study, the roles of Si in time-dependent apoplastic and symplastic Cd absorption by roots of wheat plants were investigated. Results showed that, during short-term Cd exposure, the symplastic pathway of Cd in roots was not significantly affected by Si. Cell wall properties and cell wall-bound Cd regarding the apoplastic pathway were unaffected by Si either. Nevertheless, Cd concentrations in the apoplastic fluid of roots were decreased by Si. The reason could be that Si delayed endodermal suberization of roots resulting in promoted apoplastic Cd translocation to shoots, thus decreasing Cd in the apoplastic fluid of roots after short-term Cd stress. By contrast, after long-term Cd stress, cell wall properties and the expression of genes related to Cd influx and transport were unaffected. Intriguingly, Si up-regulated the expression of the Cd efflux-related gene TaTM20 and repressed apoplastic Cd translocation to shoots, which might contribute to decrease of Cd after long-term Cd exposure. Taken together, these results indicate that Si-dependent decrease in root Cd concentrations during short-term Cd exposure helps plants to mitigate Cd toxicity in the long-term."

Despite its economic importance, the genetic diversity and population structure of D. abderus remain unknown. We sequenced a fragment of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome oxidase I region (COI), of six populations of D. abderus from the Southern Cone of America. The mtDNA marker revealed a high haplotype diversity, high pairwise F ST values, and significant genetic variations among populations. No correlation was found between genetic and geographical distances, yet the most common haplotype (Dab01) was present in four out of the six populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed that most of the variation was within populations of D. abderus. Tajima's D and Fu's F S tests indicated no evidence that D. abderus populations are under recent expansion. Our results indicate that genetic-based traits will likely remain localized or spread slowly, and management strategies need to be undertaken on a small scale."

Metalloproteins play important roles in plant-pathogen interactions. Hence, the present work is aimed to predict and analyze the iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) binding proteins of P. syringae pv. lapsa which help in its growth, adaptation, survival and pathogenicity. A total of 232 Fe, 307 Zn, and 38 Cu-binding proteins have been identified. The functional annotation, subcellular localization and gene ontology enriched network analysis revealed their role in wide range of biological activities of the phytopathogen. Among the identified metalloproteins, a total of 29 Fe-binding, 31 Zn-binding, and 5 Cu-binding proteins were found to be secreted in nature. These putative secreted metalloproteins may perform diverse cellular and biological functions ranging from transport, response to oxidative stress, proteolysis, antimicrobial resistance, metabolic processes, protein folding and DNA repair. The observations obtained here may provide initial information required to draft new schemes to control microbial infections of staple food crops and will further help in developing sustainable agriculture."

"30166137","abstracttext","This study focused on the performance of the dextran producer Leuconostoc citreum as starter culture during 30 days of wheat flour type I sourdough propagation (back-slopping). As confirmed by RAPD-PCR analysis, the strain dominated throughout the propagation procedure, consisting of daily fermentations at 20 °C. The sourdoughs were characterized by consistent lactic acid bacteria cell density and acidification parameters, reaching pH values of 4.0 and mild titratable acidity. Carbohydrates consumption remained consistent during the propagation procedure, leading to formation of mannitol and almost equimolar amount of lactic and acetic acid. The addition of sucrose enabled the formation of dextran, inducing an increase in viscosity of the sourdough of 2-2.6 fold, as well as oligosaccharides. The transcriptional analysis based on glucosyltransferases genes (GH70) showed the existence in L. citreum FDR241 of at least five different dextransucrases. Among these, only one gene, previously identified as forming only α-(1-6) glycosidic bonds, was significantly upregulated in sourdough fermentation conditions, and the main responsible of dextran formation. A successful application of a starter culture during long sourdough back-slopping procedure will depend on the strain robustness and fermentation conditions. Transcriptional regulation of EPS-synthetizing genes might contribute to increase the efficiency of industrial processes."

Here we show the application of this tool in the wheat and maize pathogen, Fusarium graminearum. We explored three different ways to introduce Cre into strains with floxed genes, namely transformation with an episomal or integrative plasmid (pLC28), fusion of protoplasts of strains carrying floxed genes with strains expressing Cre by forcing heterokaryons, and crosses between strains with floxed genes and strains expressing Cre to isolate progeny in which the target genes had been deleted during the cross. We used this system for the construction of strains bearing auxotrophic markers that were generated by gene replacement with positively selectable markers followed by Cre-mediated marker excision. In addition, updated protocols for transformation and crosses for F. graminearum are provided. In combination, strains and tools developed here add to the arsenal of methods that can be used to carry out molecular genetics with F. graminearum."

"29762476","abstracttext","The APETALA2/ethylene response factor (AP2/ERF) superfamily is involved in the responses of plants to biotic and abiotic stresses; however, the functions and mechanisms of some members of this family in plants are unclear. In our previous study, expression of TaERFL1a , a member of the AP2/ERF family, was remarkably induced in wheat seedlings suffering freezing stress. In this study, we show that its expression was rapidly upregulated in response to salt, cold, and water deficiency, suggesting roles in the responses to abiotic stresses. Further, transient barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) resulted in significantly reduced tolerance to 20% PEG6000-stimulated water deficiency. Subcellular localization and transcriptional activation assays separately showed that TaERFL1a was targeted to the nucleus and possessed transcriptional activation activity. Yeast two-hybrid library screening identified six interacting proteins, and of these, the interactions between TaERFL1a and TaSGT1, and TaERFL1a and TaDAD2 proteins were further confirmed by yeast co-transformation and bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC). Collectively, our results suggest that TaERFL1a is a stress-responsive transcription factor, which could be functionally related to proteins involved in the abiotic stress responses of plants."

"30764446","abstracttext","A species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method was developed to detect and identify the root-lesion nematodes Pratylenchus neglectus and P. thornei from soil. A primer set was designed from Pratylenchus 28S rRNA gene sequences of the D3 expansion domain. Primer specificity was confirmed with 23 isolates of 15 nematode species and other plant-parasitic and non-plant-parasitic nematodes typically present in the soil communities, and with six fungal species commonly associated with wheat root rot. DNA obtained using a commercially available kit and a method developed in our laboratory gave comparable amplification. PCR conditions were optimized and the two species were differentiated by PCR products of 144 bp for P. neglectus and 288 bp for P. thornei. With this assay, we detected a single juvenile in 1 g of sterile, inoculated soil. Examination of 30 field soil samples revealed that this method was applicable to a range of soils naturally infested with these two pathogens in Oregon. This PCR-based method is rapid, efficient, and reliable, does not require expertise in nematode taxonomy and morphology, and could be used as a rapid diagnostic tool for commercial and research applications for disease forecasting and management."

"30845519","abstracttext","Maize (Zea mays) and itch grass (Rottboellia cochinchinensis) plants exhibiting a mild mosaic or mottle were collected from a farmer's field near Mokwa, Nigeria, in 1993. Icosahedral virions (approximately 28 to 30 nm) were purified from symptomatic tissue by differential centrifugation in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. The virions are composed of one single-stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 4,000 nucleotides and, as estimated by 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), a capsid protein of approximately 28 kDa. The virus was readily detected in infected plants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblot assays with a polyclonal rabbit antibody derived from purified virions. A partial cDNA library was generated with random primers. Sequence analyses of a cDNA clone representing a portion of the putative replicase gene aligned most closely with related sequences of viruses within the Tombusviridae. In particular, a region of 78 predicted amino acids surrounding the ""GDD"" replicase motif shares 73% identity with panicum mosaic virus and 61% identity with maize chlorotic mottle virus. The virus is readily transmitted by mechanical inoculation to sweet and dent corn, millet, and wheat. Currently it is not considered of economic importance in Nigeria. The data suggest that ""maize mild mottle virus"" is a newly identified virus infecting maize."

"30945203","abstracttext","Recently, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are shown to be implicating nuclear domain organization and gene regulation by mediating long-range chromatin interactions. Chromosome conformation capture (3C) is a method used to study such long-range interaction between two different loci in the 3D nuclear space. Through successive improvement in resolution and throughput, 3C, chromosome conformation capture on chip (4C), and chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C) to Hi-C methods were developed to study interactions between loci from one versus one scale to an unprecedented genome-wide resolution. In situ Hi-C is a variant of Hi-C in which proximity ligation is performed at the intact nuclei to improve the signal-to-noise ratio and throughput of the experiment to provide useful genome-wide contact frequency matrix/maps. The contact frequency maps obtained could be used for physical ordering of scaffolds in complex genome assembly projects, in deducing the nuclear domain organization in high resolution and in identifying specific long-range interactions between genomic regions of interest. In this chapter, we describe in detail a protocol for in situ Hi-C used on crops like barley, wheat, rye, oat, and evening primrose."

"32397544","abstracttext","A new mycovirus was found in the Fusarium culmorum strain A104-1 originally sampled on wheat in Belgium. This novel virus, for which the name Fusarium culmorum virus 1 (FcV1) is suggested, is phylogenetically related to members of the previously proposed family ''Unirnaviridae''. FcV1 has a monopartite dsRNA genome of 2898 bp that harbors two large non-overlapping ORFs. A typical -1 slippery motif is found at the end of ORF1, advocating that ORF2 is translated by programmed ribosomal frameshifting. While ORF2 exhibits a conserved replicase domain, ORF1 encodes for an undetermined protein. Interestingly, a hypothetically transcribed gene similar to unirnaviruses ORF1 was found in the genome of Lipomyces starkeyi , presumably resulting from a viral endogenization in this yeast. Conidial isolation and chemical treatment were unsuccessful to obtain a virus-free isogenic line of the fungal host, highlighting a high retention rate for FcV1 but hindering its biological characterization. In parallel, attempt to horizontally transfer FcV1 to another strain of F. culmorum by dual culture failed. Eventually, a screening of other strains of the same fungal species suggests the presence of FcV1 in two other strains from Europe."

"30661219","abstracttext","This study was aimed at characterizing the anthocyanins and phenolics profile in different varieties of pigmented corn and wheat and in some of their milling fractions. Acid/ethanol extracts were used to assess total anthocyanins, overall antioxidant activity, the overall polyphenol profile, and for evaluating the inhibition of pancreatic α-amylase and of intestinal α-glucosidase. Both enzymes were inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by all extracts, but individual extracts had specific effects on each enzyme. Anti-inflammatory response was evaluated by using acid-free extracts and Caco-2 cells transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter gene responding to cytokine stimulation. The immune response of interleukin-stimulated cells decreased significantly in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of 20-50 μM/l anthocyanins from all grains extracts, again with a different efficiency. The inhibitory ability and the anti-inflammatory capability of these extracts are in most cases higher than in similar extracts from other sources, suggesting that activities in each extract may imply specific synergies between anthocyanins and other phenolics."

"30644420","abstracttext","Abiotic stress significantly impacts growth and yield of crop plants. It is imperative for crop improvement to discover and utilize stress-tolerant functional genes. In this study, genes responding to abiotic stresses, such as freezing, salt and osmotic stress, were screened from a cDNA yeast library that was constructed from the drought- and heat-tolerant wheat variety Hanxuan 10. After screening for surviving clones we isolated 7,249, 4,313 and 4,469 raw sequences, corresponding to 4,695, 2,641 and 2,771 genes following each treatment. Venn diagrams revealed 377 overlapping genes. GO analysis suggested that these genes were mainly involved in the metabolic and stress signal pathways. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the isolated genes predominantly belonged to pathways concerning energy and metabolism. Overlapping gene TaPR-1-1 within the pathogenesis-related (PR) protein family was selected for detailed characterization. Although previous studies had shown that PR genes function during pathogen attack, our results demonstrated that TaPR-1-1 expression was also induced by freezing, salinity, and osmotic stresses. Overexpression in yeast and Arabidopsis showed that TaPR-1-1 conferred tolerance to these stresses. We concluded that screening cDNA yeast libraries following abiotic stress is an efficient way to identify stress-tolerance genes."

However, the strongest chemoattractant for bacteria to colonize the rhizosphere and mycelia is not clear. Coincidentally, almost all the PGPRs possess 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase (AcdS) and can utilize ACC as the sole nitrogen source. Here, we found that ACC was a novel, metabolic dependent and methyl-accepting chemoreceptor-involved chemoattractant for Pseudomonas putida UW4. The chemotactic response of UW4 to ACC is significantly greater than that to the amino acids and organic acids identified in the plant root and fungal hyphal exudates. The colonization counts of the UW4 acdS or cheR deletion mutants in the wheat rhizosphere and on Agaricus bisporus mycelia were reduced one magnitude compared with those of UW4. The colonization counts of UW4 on A. bisporus antisense ACC oxidase mycelia with a high ACC production significantly increased compared with A. bisporus , followed by the UW4 cheR complementary strain and the ethylene chemoreceptor gene-deletion mutant. The colonization counts of the UW4 strains on A. bisporus acdS + mycelia with a low ACC production decreased significantly compared with A. bisporus wild type. These results suggested that ACC and not ethylene should be the strongest chemoattractant for the PGPR that contain AcdS."

"30323824","abstracttext","Drought is one of the major environmental stresses limiting crop growth and production. MYB family transcription factors play crucial roles in response to abiotic stresses. Previous studies found that TaMYB31 is transcriptionally induced by drought stress. However, the biological functions of TaMYB31 in drought stress responses remained unknown. In this study, three TaMYB31 homoeologous genes from hexaploid wheat, designated TaMYB31-A, TaMYB31-B , and TaMYB31-D , were cloned and characterized. Expression analysis showed that TaMYB31 genes have different tissue expression patterns, and TaMYB31-B has relatively high expression levels in most tested tissues. All the three homoeologs were up-regulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000 and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Subcellular localization analyses revealed that TaMYB31 is localized to the nucleus. Ectopic expression of the TaMYB31-B gene in Arabidopsis affected plants growth and enhanced drought tolerance. In addition, seed germination and seedling root growth of TaMYB31-B transgenic plants were more sensitive to exogenous ABA treatment compared to wild type control. RNA-seq analysis indicated that TaMYB31 functions through up-regulation of wax biosynthesis genes and drought-responsive genes. These results provide evidence that TaMYB31 acts as a positive regulator of drought resistance, and justify its potential application in genetic modification of crop drought tolerance."

A rice grasshopper-specific primer pair and probe targeting the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene were newly designed, having an amplicon size of 110 bp. The specificity of this primer pair and probe was verified using 19 insects and five crustaceans and no cross-reactivity was obtained against the non-target species. The absolute limit of detection (LOD) was 0.5 pg of rice grasshopper DNA, and as low as 0.1% of rice grasshopper was detected in raw, heat-treated, and autoclaved binary insect mixtures. To evaluate the effect of food matrix, binary mixtures containing rice grasshopper in wheat were used additionally, and at least 0.1% of target species was detected using this assay. The applicability of this assay was confirmed using nine commercial food samples labeled as containing rice grasshopper or locust. The fast real-time PCR developed in this study is a specific and sensitive method for identifying edible rice grasshopper in various food samples."
"31848057","articletitle","Relationship between tillage management and DMPSA nitrification inhibitor efficiency."
"31848057","abstracttext","Agricultural sustainability is compromised by nitrogen (N) losses caused by soil microbial activity. Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG) produced as consequence of nitrification and denitrification processes in soils. Nitrification inhibitors (NI) as 3,4-dimethylpyrazole-succinic acid (DMPSA) are useful tools to reduce these N losses from fertilization. The objective of this work was to test the efficiency of DMPSA in two different tillage management systems, conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT), in a winter wheat crop under Humid Mediterranean conditions. N fertilizer was applied as ammonium sulphate (AS) with or without DMPSA in a single or split application, including an unfertilized treatment. GHG fluxes (N 2 O, CO 2 and CH 4 ) were measured by the closed chamber method. amoA and nosZI genes were quantified by qPCR as indicators of nitrifying and denitrifying populations. Nitrification was inhibited by DMPSA in both CT and NT, while the higher water filled pore space (WFPS) in NT promoted a better efficiency of DMPSA in this system. This higher efficiency might be due to a greater N 2 O reduction to N 2 as result of the nosZI gene induction. Consequently, DMPSA was able to reduce N 2 O emissions down to the unfertilized levels in NT. Provided that NT reduced CO 2 emissions and maintained crop yield compared to CT, the application DMPSA under NT management is a promising strategy to increase agro-systems sustainability under Humid Mediterranean conditions."

"31818619","abstracttext","Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants and could produce oxidative toxicity to plants. Our previous study has shown that miR398 is involved in response to phenanthrene treatment by targeting CSD1 and CSD2. However, it is not clear which is essential for CSD1 and CSD2 and how miR398 changes. In this study, we performed discontinuous PAGE to separate superoxide dismutase (SOD) isozymes and found that two bands of the cytosolic Cu/Zn-SOD are induced by phenanthrene at day 5 and 7. Low expression of pri-miR398 and high expression of pre-miR398 indicate that the conversion process from pri-miR398 to pre-miR398 is impeded, which causes decrease in mature miR398. The relative expression of CSD1 is entirely up-regulated, further confirming the important role of CSD1 in response to phenanthrene exposure. Besides, the overexpression of WRKY implies its potential function in answering the call from phenanthrene stress. Therefore, it is concluded that the gene silencing of CSD1 recedes due to the biosynthesis inhibition of miR398, causing the increase of SOD activity in response to phenanthrene exposure in wheat roots. Our results are useful not only for better understanding miRNAs regulation in detoxication of reactive oxygen species, but also for alleviating the toxicity to crops caused by PAHs."

"31835394","abstracttext","Increasing demands for food and resources are challenging existing markets, driving a need to continually investigate and establish crop varieties with improved yields and health benefits. By the later part of the century, current estimates indicate that a >50% increase in the yield of most of the important food crops including wheat, rice and barley will be needed to maintain food supplies and improve nutritional quality to tackle what has become known as 'hidden hunger'. Improving the nutritional quality of crops has become a target for providing the micronutrients required in remote communities where dietary variation is often limited. A number of methods to achieve this have been investigated over recent years, from improving photosynthesis through genetic engineering, to breeding new higher yielding varieties. Recent research has shown that growing plants under elevated [CO 2 ] can lead to an increase in Vitamin C due to changes in gene expression, demonstrating one potential route for plant biofortification. In this review, we discuss the current research being undertaken to improve photosynthesis and biofortify key crops to secure future food supplies and the potential links between improved photosynthesis and nutritional quality."

"31598288","abstracttext","Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa ( Xtu ) is a proteobacteria which causes bacterial leaf streak (BLS) or bacterial chaff disease in wheat and barley. The constant competition for zinc (Zn) metal nutrients contributes significantly in plant-pathogen interactions. In this study, we have employed a systematic in silico approach to study the Zn-binding proteins of Xtu. From the whole proteome of Xtu , we have identified approximately 7.9% of proteins having Zn-binding sequence and structural motifs . Further, 115 proteins were found homologous to plant-pathogen interaction database. Among these 115 proteins, 11 were predicted as putative secretory proteins. The functional diversity in Zn-binding proteins was revealed by functional domain, gene ontology and subcellular localization analysis. The roles of Zn-binding proteins were found to be varied in the range from metabolism, proteolysis, protein biosynthesis, transport, cell signalling, protein folding, transcription regulation, DNA repair, response to oxidative stress, RNA processing, antimicrobial resistance, DNA replication and DNA integration. This study provides preliminary information on putative Zn-binding proteins of Xtu which may further help in designing new metal-based antimicrobial agents for controlling BLS and bacterial chaff infections on staple crops."

"31792788","abstracttext","Feruloyl esterase (FAE) is a critical enzyme in bio-extraction of ferulic acid (FA) from plant cell wall. A new FAE (EpFAE1) encoding gene was isolated from Eupenicillium parvum and heterologously expressed in Pichia pastoris cells. Based on phylogenetic tree analysis, the protein EpFAE1 belongs to type A of the seventh FAE subfamily. Using methyl ferulate as substrate, the optimum temperature and pH for the catalytic activity of EpFAE1 were 50 °C and 5.5, respectively. The enzyme exhibited high stability at 50 °C, in a wide pH range (3.0-11.0), or in the presence of 2 M of NaCl. Together with the endo-xylanase EpXYN1, EpFAE1 released 72.32% and 4.00% of the alkali-extractable FA from de-starched wheat bran (DSWB) or de-starched corn bran (DSCB), respectively. Meanwhile, the substrates were pretreated with 1.75% (for DSWB) or 1.0% (for DSCB) of phosphoric acid (PA) at 90 °C for 12 h, followed by enzymatic hydrolysis of the soluble and insoluble fractions. The release efficiencies of FA were up to 84.64% for DSWB and 66.73% for DSCB. Combined dilute PA pretreatment with enzymatic hydrolysis is a low-cost and highly efficient method for the extraction of FA from cereal brans."

In this study, a proteomic platform based on 2-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time of Flight Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) was used to construct the first proteome database reference map of G. graminis var. tritici and to identify the response of the pathogen to 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), which is a natural antibiotic produced by antagonistic Pseudomonas spp. in take-all suppressive soils. For mapping, a total of 240 spots was identified that represented 209 different proteins. The most abundant biological function categories in the Ggt proteome were related to carbohydrate metabolism (21%), amino acid metabolism (15%), protein folding and degradation (12%), translation (11%), and stress response (10%). In total, 51 Ggt proteins were affected by DAPG treatment. Based on gene ontology, carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, stress response, and protein folding and degradation proteins were the ones most modulated by DAPG treatment. This study provides the first extensive proteomic reference map constructed for Ggt and represents the first time that the response of Ggt to DAPG has been characterized at the proteomic level."

"31915951","abstracttext","Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are a group of bacteria that promote plants growth in the rhizosphere. PGPRs are involved in various mechanisms that reinforce plant development. In this study, we screened for PGPRs that were effective in early growth of Arabidopsis thaliana when added to the media and one Bacillus subtilis strain L1 (Bs L1) was selected for further study. When Bs L1 was placed near the roots, seedlings showed notably stronger growth than that in the control, particularly in biomass and root hair. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed a high level of expression of the high affinity nitrate transporter gene, NRT2.1 in A. thaliana treated with Bs L1. After considering how Bs L1 could promote plant growth, we focused on nitrate, which is essential to plant growth. The nitrate content was lower in A. thaliana treated with Bs L1. However, examination of the activity of nitrate reductase revealed higher activity in plants treated with PGPR than in the control. Bs L1 had pronounced effects in representative crops (wheat and lettuce). These results suggest that Bs L1 promotes the assimilation and use of nitrate and plant growth."
"31972219","articletitle","Engineered minichromosomes in plants."
"31972219","abstracttext","Artificial chromosome platforms are described in plants. Because the function of centromeres is largely epigenetic, attempts to produce artificial chromosomes with plant centromere DNA have failed. The removal of the centromeric sequences from the cell strips off the centromeric histone that is the apparent biochemical marker of centromere activity. Thus, engineered minichromosomes have been produced by telomere mediated chromosomal truncation. The introduction of telomere repeats will cleave the chromosome at the site of insertion and attach the accompanying transgenes in the process. Such truncation events have been documented in maize, Arabidopsis, barley, rice, Brassica and wheat. Truncation of the nonvital supernumerary B chromosome of maize is a favorite target but engineered minichromosomes derived from the normal A chromosomes have also been recovered. Transmission through mitosis of small chromosomes is apparently normal but there is loss during meiosis. Potential solutions to address this issue are discussed. With procedures now well established to produce the foundation for artificial chromosomes in plants, current efforts are directed at building them up to specification using gene stacking methods and editing techniques."

"32057178","abstracttext","The current study was designed to explore the role and underlying mechanism of lncRNA taurine up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) in cardiac hypertrophy. Mice were treated by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery to induce cardiac hypertrophy, and cardiomyocytes were treated by phenylephrine (PE) to induce hypertrophic phenotype. Haematoxylin-eosin (HE), wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) and immunofluorescence (IF) were used to examine morphological alterations. Real-time PCR, Western blots and IF staining were used to detect the expression of RNAs and proteins. Luciferase assay and RNA pull-down assay were used to verify the interaction. It is revealed that TUG1 was up-regulated in the hearts of mice treated by TAC surgery and in PE-induced cardiomyocytes. Functionally, overexpression of TUG1 alleviated cardiac hypertrophy both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanically, TUG1 sponged and sequestered miR-34a to increase the Dickkopf 1 (DKK1) level, which eventually inhibited the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signalling. In conclusion, the current study reported the protective role and regulatory mechanism of TUG1 in cardiac hypertrophy and suggested that TUG1 may serve as a novel molecular target for treating cardiac hypertrophy."

"32006055","abstracttext_key message","The review summarizes the functions of the plant special transcription factors CCT family genes in multiple traits and discusses the molecular breeding strategies with CCT family genes in the future. Plants integrate circadian clock and external signals such as temperature and photoperiod to synchronize flowering with seasonal environmental changes. This process makes cereal crops including short-day crops, such as rice and maize, and long-day crops, such as wheat and barley, better adapt to varied growth zones from temperate to tropical regions. CCT family genes involve circadian clock and photoperiodic flowering pathways and help plants set a suitable flowering time to produce offspring. Beyond the flowering time, CCT family genes in cereal crops are associated with biomass and grain yield. Moreover, recent studies showed that they also associate with photosynthesis, nutrition use efficiency and stress tolerance. Here, we systematically review the progress in functional characterization of CCT family genes in flowering, geographical adaptation and grain yield formation, raise the core questions related to their molecular mechanisms and discuss how to practice them in genetic improvement in cereal crops by combining gene diagnosis and top-level design."
"31248042","articletitle","Lineage-Specific Evolved MicroRNAs Regulating NB-LRR Defense Genes in Triticeae ."
"31248042","abstracttext","Disease resistance genes encoding proteins with nucleotide binding sites and Leucine-Rich Repeat (NB-LRR) domains include many members involved in the effector-triggered immunity pathway in plants. The transcript levels of these defense genes are negatively regulated by diverse microRNAs (miRNAs) in angiosperms and gymnosperms. In wheat, using small RNA expression datasets and degradome datasets, we identified five miRNA families targeting NB-LRR defense genes in monocots, some of which arose in the Triti ceae species era. These miRNAs regulate different types of NB-LRR genes, most of them with coil-coiled domains, and trigger the generation of secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNA) as a phased pattern in the target site regions. In addition to acting in response to biotic stresses, they are also responsive to abiotic stresses such as heat, drought, salt, and light stress. Their copy number and expression variation in Triticeae suggest a rapid birth and death frequency. Altogether, non-conserved miRNAs as conserved transcriptional regulators in gymnosperms and angiosperms regulating the disease resistance genes displayed quick plasticity including the variations of sequences, gene copy number, functions, and expression level, which accompanied with NB-LRR genes may be tune-regulated to plants in natural environments with various biotic and abiotic stresses."

A polyphasic approach, including phenotypic characterization and phylogenetic multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA), was used to determine the taxonomic position of this strain. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that the novel strain is closely related to Streptomyces cavourensis NBRC 13026 T , Streptomyces albolongus NBRC 13465 T and Streptomyces araujoniae ASBV-1 T , sharing a similarity value of 98.2, 98.1 and 97.9 %, respectively. Additionally, MLSA of five housekeeping genes (atpD, gyrB, recA, rpoB and trpB) showed evolutionary distances beyond the 0.007 threshold, as well as low DNA-DNA relatedness between strain 1AS2c T and its closest phylogenetic neighbours (S. cavourensis NBRC 13026 T , S. albolongus NBRC 13465 T and S. araujoniae ASBV-1 T : 56, 62.5 and 63.0 %, respectively), indicating a new phylogenetic lineage. The phylogenetic, chemotaxonomic and phenotypic characteristics support the assignment of strain 1AS2c T to the genus Streptomyces, representing a novel species. It is concluded that strain 1AS2c T (=CMAA 1679 T =NRRL B-65479 T =DSM 105299 T ) can be classified as the type strain of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomyces rhizosphaericola sp. nov. is proposed."

"31217072","abstracttext","The heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor, geldanamycin, is a chemical inducer of the heat shock response (HSR) in Arabidopsis. Geldanamycin is thought to activate the heat shock signal by dissociating the HSP90-heat shock factor (HSF) complex. Recent studies have indicated that plant HSP70 is also associated with HSF, suggesting that inhibition of HSP70 may induce the HSR. However, no studies have been conducted to test this hypothesis. Here, we found that a specific HSP70 inhibitor VER-155008 activated the promoter of a small HSP gene (At1 g53540, HSP17.6C-CI) of Arabidopsis, which was shown to be activated by geldanamycin and other HSP90 inhibitors. The production of HSP17.6C-CI, HSP70 and HSP90.1 proteins in Arabidopsis was enhanced by the addition of VER-155008. The reduction of chlorophyll contents by heat shock was ameliorated by VER-155008. Chaperone analyses indicated that VER-155008 inhibited the chaperone activities of wheat germ extract and human HSP70/HSP40, respectively. These results suggest that the inhibition of HSP70 by VER-155008 enhanced the heat tolerance of Arabidopsis by inducing the HSR in the plant."

"31374923","abstracttext","In this study, common cereal grains were partially replaced by former foodstuffs products (FFPs) in post-weaning piglets' diets, to investigate how these alternative ingredients influence the faecal microbiota in the post-weaning period. Twelve post-weaning piglets were housed for 16 days in individual pens and were then fed two diets: a standard wheat-barley-corn meal diet and a diet containing 30% FFPs, thus partially substituting conventional cereals. The growth performance was monitored and faecal microbiota was characterized by the next generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. The results showed no detrimental effects on growth performance when FFPs were used. However, the FFP diet decreased the bacterial richness and evenness in the large intestine, while minor differences were observed in the taxa composition. The core microbiota composition was only slightly affected, and no differences between the two groups in the gut microbiota composition at the phylum level over time were observed. Thus, although these results should be interpreted with caution, as they are case-specific, FFPs can be potentially used as alternative carbohydrate sources in post-weaning piglets, but further investigations are necessary to clarify their impact on gut health when used for a longer period."

"31275002","abstracttext","Sanguinarine is an isoquinoline alkaloid produced by Papaveraceae plants. Because sanguinarine has antimicrobial activity, it is believed to be related to the plants' chemical defense systems. However, its action against plants has not been well understood. A previous study reported that among 12 alkaloids, sanguinarine was the only compound which enhanced heat tolerance in Arabidopsis . Here we performed a promoter assay using a heat shock protein gene ( HSP17.6C-CI ) of Arabidopsis to assess the induction of heat shock responses by alkaloids. Although sanguinarine induced the heat shock response, the other 11 alkaloids did not. Sanguinarine promoted the production of HSP17.6C-CI protein, but berberine and papaverine, which are isoquinoline alkaloids as well as sanguinarine, did not promote it. It is known that geldanamycin, a small molecule chaperone inhibitor, activates the heat shock response in Arabidopsis . Although sanguinarine inhibited the chaperone activities of wheat germ extract much like geldanamycin, berberine and papaverine influenced the activities very little. These results suggest that sanguinarine may promote the heat shock response by regulating the chaperone activities in the way that geldanamycin does in plants."

"31233661","abstracttext","Nearly 1400 Bacillus strains growing in the plant rhizosphere were sampled from different sites on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Forty-five of the isolates, selected due to their biocontrol activity, were genome-sequenced and their taxonomic identification revealed that they were representatives of the Bacillus subtilis species complex (20) and the Bacillus cereus group (9). Majority of the remaining strains were found closely related to Bacillus pumilus, but their average nucleotide identity based on BLAST and electronic DNA/DNA hybridization values excluded closer taxonomic identification. A total of 45 different gene clusters involved in synthesis of secondary metabolites were detected by mining the genomes of the 45 selected strains. Except eight mesophilic strains, the 37 remaining strains were found either cold-adapted or psychrophilic, able to propagate at 10°C and below (Bacillus wiedmannii NMSL88 and Bacillus sp. RJGP41). Pot experiments performed at 10°C with winter wheat seedlings revealed that cold-adapted representatives of B. pumilus, B. safensis and B. atrophaeus promoted growth of the seedlings under cold conditions, suggesting that these bacilli isolated from a cold environment are promising candidates for developing of bioformulations useful for application in sustainable agriculture under environmental conditions unfavourable for the mesophilic bacteria presently in use."

"31463519","abstracttext_key message","Stripe rust resistance gene, Yr82, was mapped in chromosome 3BL using SNP markers. Yr82 interacted with Yr29 to produce lower stripe rust responses at the adult plant stage. Landrace Aus27969 produced low infection types against Australian Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) pathotypes. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) F 7 population from the Aus27969/Avocet S cross was developed. Monogenic segregation for seedling stripe rust response was observed among the RIL population, and the resistance locus was named Yr82. Bulk segregant analysis performed using the iSelect wheat 90 K Infinium SNP array located Yr82 in the long arm of chromosome 3B. The RIL population was screened against stripe rust under field conditions and was genotyped with targeted genotyping-by-sequencing assay. QTL analysis detected the involvement of chromosomes 1B and 3B in controlling stripe rust resistance carried by Aus27969. Incorporation of Yr82 and marker SNPLr46G22 into the linkage map showed that the QTL in 1B and 3B represented Yr29 and Yr82, respectively. Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers sun KASP_300 and KASP_8775 flanked Yr82 distally and proximally, respectively, each at 2 cM distance.

"31434274","abstracttext","Cereals and, especially, rice, maize, and wheat, are essential commodities, on which human nutrition is based. Expanding population and food demand have required higher production which has been achieved by increasing fertilization, and especially nitrogen supply to cereal crops. In fact, nitrogen is a crucial nutrient for the plant, but excessive use poses serious environmental and health issues. Therefore, increasing nitrogen use efficiency in cereals is of pivotal importance for sustainable agriculture. The main steps in the use of nitrogen are uptake and transport, reduction and assimilation, and translocation and remobilization. Many studies have been carried out on the genes involved in these phases, and on transcription factors regulating these genes. Lately, increasing attention has been paid to miRNAs responding to abiotic stress, including nutrient deficiency. Many miRNAs have been found to regulate transcription factors acting on the expression of specific genes for nitrogen uptake or remobilization. Recent studies on gene regulatory networks have also demonstrated that miRNAs can interact with several nodes in the network, functioning as key regulators in nitrogen metabolism."

"31595387","abstracttext","During the Green Revolution in the 1960s, breeding dwarf cultivars turned out to be a landmark, leading to a significant increase in the global production of wheat and rice. The most direct and effective strategy for breeding dwarf crops, among others, would be to control endogenous gibberellin (GA) levels of the crops. GA 2-oxidases are a group of 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases that catalyze the deactivation of bioactive GAs. The ArabidopsisAtGA2ox1 gene was transformed into maize with the aim of obtaining a height-reduced GM maize. The characterization of the GM maize revealed that the highest plant height reduction was accomplished by a 74% decline in GA 1 level, and by approximately twofold increases in both chlorophyll content and root/shoot ratio over the wild-type (WT). Interestingly, the stem cells of the GM maize were condensed, and the typical vascular bundle structure was found to be deformed. Based on a 2-season field trial, the GM maize exhibited a higher harvest index (9-17%) and grain yield (10-14%) than the WT. The current results suggest that a modulation of the endogenous GA level would be a sensible approach for improving the crop architecture and grain yield in maize."

Traditional DNA delivery methods for plants suffer from host-species limitations, low transformation efficiencies, tissue damage, or unavoidable and uncontrolled DNA integration into the host genome. We have demonstrated efficient plasmid DNA delivery into intact plants of several species with functionalized high-aspect-ratio carbon nanotube (CNT) nanoparticles (NPs), enabling efficient DNA delivery into a variety of non-model plant species (arugula, wheat, and cotton) and resulting in high protein expression levels without transgene integration. Herein, we provide a protocol that can be implemented by plant biologists and adapted to produce functionalized single-walled CNTs (SWNTs) with surface chemistries optimized for delivery of plasmid DNA in a plant species-independent manner. This protocol describes how to prepare, construct, and optimize polyethylenimine (PEI)-functionalized SWNTs and perform plasmid DNA loading. The authors also provide guidance on material characterization, gene expression evaluation, and storage conditions. The entire protocol, from the covalent functionalization of SWNTs to expression quantification, can be completed in 5 d."

Targeting Induced Local Lesions in Genomes (TILLinG), when coupled with next-generation sequencing allows high-throughput mutation discovery and selection by genotyping. We mutagenized an advanced durum breeding line, UAD0951096_F2:5 and performed short-read (2x125 bp) Illumina sequencing of the exome of 100 lines using an available exome capture platform. To improve variant calling, we generated a consolidated exome reference using the recently available genome sequences of the cultivars Svevo and Kronos to facilitate the alignment of reads from the UAD0951096_F2:5 derived mutants. The resulting exome reference was 484.4 Mbp. We also developed a user-friendly, searchable database and bioinformatic analysis pipeline that allowed us to predict zygosity of the mutations discovered and extracts flanking sequences for rapid marker development. Here, we present these tools with the aim of allowing researchers fast and accurate downstream selection of mutations discovered by TILLinG by sequencing to support functional annotation of the durum wheat genome."

"33013749","abstracttext","The use of beneficial microbes as inoculants able to improve fitness, growth and health of plants also in stress conditions is an attractive low-cost and eco-friendly alternative strategy to harmful chemical inputs. Thirteen potential plant growth-promoting bacteria were isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat plants cultivated under drought stress and nitrogen deficiency. Among these, the two isolates TL8 and TL13 showed multiple plant growth promotion activities as production of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), siderophores, ammonia, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase production, the ability to solubilize phosphate as well as exerted antimicrobial activity against plant pathogens as Botrytis spp. and Phytophthora spp. The two selected strains were identified as Kosakonia pseudosacchari by sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. They resulted also tolerant to abiotic stress and were able to efficiently colonize plant roots as observed in vitro assay under fluorescence microscope. Based on the best PGP properties, the strain K. pseudosacchari TL13 was selected to develop a new microbial based formulate. A sustainable and environmentally friendly process for inoculant production was developed using agro-industrial by-products for microbial growth. Moreover, the application of K. pseudosacchari TL13- based formulates in pot experiment improved growth performance of maize plants."

"32985748","abstracttext","Plants quickly accumulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) to resist against pathogen invasion, while pathogens strive to escape host immune surveillance by degrading ROS. However, the nature of the strategies that fungal pathogens adopt to counteract host-derived oxidative stress is manifold and requires deep investigation. In this study, a superoxide dismutase (SOD) from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) PsSOD2 with a signal peptide (SP) and the glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchor, strongly induced during infection, was analysed for its biological characteristics and potential role in wheat-Pst interactions. The results showed that PsSOD2 encodes a Cu-only SOD and responded to ROS treatment. Heterologous complementation assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae suggest that the SP of PsSOD2 is functional for its secretion. Transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves revealed that PsSOD2 is localized to the plasma membrane. In addition, knockdown of PsSOD2 by host-induced gene silencing reduced Pst virulence and resulted in restricted hyphal development and increased ROS accumulation. In contrast, heterologous transient assays of PsSOD2 suppressed flg22-elicited ROS production. Taken together, our data indicate that PsSOD2, as a virulence factor, was induced and localized to the plasma membrane where it may function to scavenge host-derived ROS for promoting fungal infection."

"33105838","abstracttext","Fusarium subglutinans is a plant pathogenic fungus infecting cereal grain crops. In 2011, the species was divided in Fusarium temperatum sp. nov. and F. subglutinans sensu stricto . In order to determine the occurrence and significance of F. temperatum and F. subglutinans on maize, a monitoring of maize ears and stalks was carried out in Germany in 2017 and 2018. Species identification was conducted by analysis of the translation elongation factor 1α ( TEF-1α ) gene. Ninety-four isolates of F. temperatum and eight isolates of F. subglutinans were obtained during two years of monitoring from 60 sampling sites in nine federal states of Germany. Inoculation of maize ears revealed a superior aggressiveness for F. temperatum , followed by Fusarium graminearum , Fusarium verticillioides , and F. subglutinans. On maize stalks, F. graminearum was the most aggressive species while F. temperatum and F. subglutinans caused only small lesions. The optimal temperature for infection of maize ears with F. temperatum was 24 °C and 21 °C for F. subglutinans . All strains of F. temperatum and F. subglutinans were pathogenic on wheat and capable to cause moderate to severe head blight symptoms. The assessment of mycotoxin production of 60 strains of F. temperatum cultivated on rice revealed that all strains produced beauvericin, moniliformin, fusaric acid, and fusaproliferin. The results demonstrate a higher prevalence and aggressiveness of F. temperatum compared to F. subglutinans in German maize cultivation areas."

"33193748","abstracttext","Plant height (PH) plays a pivotal role in plant morphological architecture and is associated with yield potential in wheat. For the quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis, a recombinant inbred line population was developed between varieties differing significantly in PH. Two major QTL were identified on chromosomes 4B ( QPh.sicau-4B ) and 6D ( QPh.sicau-6D ) in multiple environments, which were then validated in two different backgrounds by using closely linked markers. QPh.sicau-4B explained 10.1-21.3% of the phenotypic variance, and the location corresponded to the dwarfing gene Rht-B1 . QPh.sicau-6D might be a novel QTL for PH, explaining 6.6-13.6% of the phenotypic variance and affecting spike length, thousand-kernel weight, and spikelet compactness. Three candidate genes associated with plant growth and development were identified in the physical interval of QPh.sicau-6D . Collectively, we identified a novel stable and major PH QTL, QPh.sicau-6D , which could aid in the development of closely linked markers for marker-assisted breeding and cloning genes underlying this QTL."

"32737868","abstracttext","The chitinases have extensive biotechnological potential but have been little exploited commercially due to the low number of good chitinolytic microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to identify a chitinolytic fungal and optimize its production using solid state fermentation (SSF) and agroindustry substrate, to evaluate different chitin sources for chitinase production, to evaluate different solvents for the extraction of enzymes produced during fermentation process, and to determine the nematicide effect of enzymatic extract and biological control of Meloidogyne javanica and Meloidogyne incognita nematodes. The fungus was previously isolated from bedbugs of Tibraca limbativentris Stal (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae) and selected among 51 isolated fungal as the largest producer of chitinolytic enzymes in SSF. The isolate UFSMQ40 has been identified as Trichoderma koningiopsis by the amplification of tef1 gene fragments. The greatest chitinase production (10.76 U gds -1 ) occurred with wheat bran substrate at 55% moisture, 15% colloidal chitin, 100% of corn steep liquor, and two discs of inoculum at 30 °C for 72 h. Considering the enzymatic inducers, the best chitinase production by the isolated fungus was achieved using chitin in colloidal, powder, and flakes. The usage of 1:15 g/mL of sodium citrate-phosphate buffer was the best ratio for chitinase extraction of SSF. The Trichoderma koningiopsis UFSMQ40 showed high mortality of M. javanica and M. incognita when applied to treatments with enzymatic filtrated and the suspension of conidia."

"32664422","abstracttext","The grass family (Poaceae) is one of the largest families of flowering plants, growing in all climatic zones of all continents, which includes species of exceptional economic importance. The high adaptability of grasses to adverse environmental factors implies the existence of efficient resistance mechanisms that involve the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Of plant AMPs, defensins represent one of the largest and best-studied families. Although wheat and barley seed γ-thionins were the first defensins isolated from plants, the functional characterization of grass defensins is still in its infancy. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge of the characterized defensins from cultivated and selected wild-growing grasses. For each species, isolation of defensins or production by heterologous expression, peptide structure, biological activity, and structure-function relationship are described, along with the gene expression data. We also provide our results on in silico mining of defensin-like sequences in the genomes of all described grass species and discuss their potential functions. The data presented will form the basis for elucidation of the mode of action of grass defensins and high adaptability of grasses to environmental stress and will provide novel potent molecules for practical use in medicine and agriculture."

"32688644","abstracttext","Wheat hybrid necrosis has been genetically characterised for many years, but the specific gene(s) and the protein products involved in the processes remains unknown. In this study, protein expression in the base (B), mid (M) and tip (T) segments of the FL-2 leaves of a necrotic hybrid, PZF1 and its parents, Pan555 and Zheng891, was analysed and compared using a high throughput proteomic approach. Twenty-three protein spots, with significant variations in intensity across the necrotic leaf segments, were analysed by MALDI-TOF-MS, of which, 18 were matched to protein accessions in the NCBI database. Several of these proteins are enzymes involved in the methylation cycle, including AdoHcy hydrolase, AdoMet synthase 3 and methionine synthase 1; AdoHcy hydrolase was downregulated sharply in M and T, and AdoMet synthase 3 and methionine synthase 1 were upregulated gradually from M to T. This result suggests that methylation-associated processes, including epigenetic mechanisms, may play a role in the initiation and development of hybrid necrosis. Several energy cycle-associated proteins and cytoprotective proteins were also differentially expressed across the leaf segments, suggesting their direct association with or possible involvement in the necrotic processes. The significant imbalance of a heat-shock protein, a transposon protein and a RNA- and ssDNA-binding protein also makes these proteins potential molecular components in the necrotic processes."

"32689213","abstracttext","NAC proteins are one of the largest families of plant transcription factors and have recently been implicated in diverse physiological processes. To elucidate their role in gene regulation, we determined the DNA-binding specificity of a drought- and cold-inducible NAC protein, TaNAC69 from wheat, and analysed its homologues from other species. Two consensus DNA-binding sequences (spanning 23-24 bp) of TaNAC69 were identified through binding site selection and both consisted of two half sites. Comprehensive data on the DNA-binding specificity of TaNAC69 were generated through extensive base substitution mutagenesis. TaNAC69 and its homologue in Arabidopsis, NAP, sharing 75% sequence identity in the NAC domain, exhibited similar DNA-binding specificity. TaNAC69 was able to homodimerise through its NAC domain. The NAC domain consists of five conserved subdomains. Subdomain mutation showed that a loss or reduction in TaNAC69 dimerisation capacity was accompanied with abolition or decrease in its DNA-binding activity. These data suggest that all subdomains are necessary to maintain a functional NAC domain structure required for interaction with DNA and dimerisation."

"33166889","abstracttext","An untargeted LC-MS/MS-based molecular networking method was established for the automatic determination of variants of enniatin and beauvericin from both fungal cultures and naturally contaminated samples. Using this method, a large number of samples can be efficiently analyzed for the presence of enniatin- and beauvericin-related compounds. As proof of concept, 26 cultures, derived from 13 fungal strains in the genera of Fusarium, Beauveria, and Diaporthe, as well as 46 food samples were analyzed. Four enniatin- and three beauvericin-producing fungi were newly discovered. Among them, the production of beauvericin by Fusarium sp. 190-20-2 was further confirmed by the presence of a beauvericin biosynthesis gene cluster in its genomic sequence. Additionally, 17 enniatin congeners, including one new isomer of enniatin A, and three previously unreported bassianolide analogues were detected from an enniatin-producing fungus, Fusarium sp. 17-048, and a beauvericin-producing fungus, Beauveria sp. 186-069, respectively. The structures of the detected compounds were tentatively determined by a series of product ions of their sodium adducts. The new isomer of enniatin A was further confirmed by NMR spectra. A preliminary survey of food samples showed that enniatins were prevalent in the tested wheat flour and noodle samples, whereas beauvericin was only discovered in cornflour powder samples."

"33305774","abstracttext","Wheat germ glycoprotein (WGP) is widely used due to its nutritional benefits and biological activity. This study evaluated the effects of WGP on intestinal-immunosuppressed mice from early life to adulthood and detected the underlying mechanism. The results revealed that WGP demonstrated no clinical side effects on the body index, serum total IgA level, protein expression and the morphology of intestine in newborn mice. In the phase of life, compared with the cyclophosphamide-treated group (CG), WGP clearly promoted the secretion of sIgA and effectively regulated the cytokine gene (IL-2, IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-5, IL-17, and TGF-β1) expression in the intestine. Furthermore, WGP promoted the expression of CD40L and CD40, phosphorylation of IKKα/β and transcription of NF-κB-p65. The data as reported in this present analysis suggest that WGP can improve the intestinal immunity of newborn mice to adulthood via the CD40L-CD40-IKKα/β-NF-κB p65 signaling pathway."

Both of these attributes typify the genome architecture in the tribe Triticeae, whose members include economically important wheat, rye and barley. Large genome sizes, an abundance of repeated sequences, and polyploidy present challenges to genome-wide SNP discovery using next-generation sequencing (NGS) of total genomic DNA by making alignment and clustering of short reads generated by the NGS platforms difficult, particularly in the absence of a reference genome sequence."
"21266061","abstracttext_results","An annotation-based, genome-wide SNP discovery pipeline is reported using NGS data for large and complex genomes without a reference genome sequence. Roche 454 shotgun reads with low genome coverage of one genotype are annotated in order to distinguish single-copy sequences and repeat junctions from repetitive sequences and sequences shared by paralogous genes. Multiple genome equivalents of shotgun reads of another genotype generated with SOLiD or Solexa are then mapped to the annotated Roche 454 reads to identify putative SNPs. A pipeline program package, AGSNP, was developed and used for genome-wide SNP discovery in Aegilops tauschii-the diploid source of the wheat D genome, and with a genome size of 4.02 Gb, of which 90% is repetitive sequences. Genomic DNA of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78 was sequenced with the Roche 454 NGS platform. Genomic DNA and cDNA of Ae. tauschii accession AS75 was sequenced primarily with SOLiD, although some Solexa and Roche 454 genomic sequences were also generated. A total of 195,631 putative SNPs were discovered in gene sequences, 155,580 putative SNPs were discovered in uncharacterized single-copy regions, and another 145,907 putative SNPs were discovered in repeat junctions. These SNPs were dispersed across the entire Ae. tauschii genome. To assess the false positive SNP discovery rate, DNA containing putative SNPs was amplified by PCR from AL8/78 and AS75 and resequenced with the ABI 3730 xl. In a sample of 302 randomly selected putative SNPs, 84.0% in gene regions, 88.0% in repeat junctions, and 81.3% in uncharacterized regions were validated."

"24202585","abstracttext","Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived by single plant descent to F8 from a hybrid of Anza, a low-quality cultivar, and Cajeme 71, a high-quality cultivar, differed in alleles at three high-molecular-weight glutenin (HMW-glu) seed storage protein loci. The 48 RILs were classified by SDS-PAGE for the Anza alleles Glu-Alc (null), Glu-B1b (subunits 7 + 8), and Glu-D1a (subunits 2 + 12) and for Cajeme 71 alleles Glu-A1a (sub-unit 1), Glu-B1I (subunits 17 + 18), and Glu-D1d (subunits 5 + 10). All RILs and parents were grown in a replicated field trial with three levels of nitrogen (N) fertilization. Additive and additive x additive gene effects for the three loci were detected by orthogonal comparisons of means for each of six wheat end-use quality traits. Each HMW-glu genotype was represented by three to ten RILs so that variability among RILs within each HMW-glu genotype could be examined. N effects were consistently small. All traits except flour yield were highly correlated with predictor traits studied earlier. Flour protein content, baking water absorption, dough mixing time, bread loaf volume, and bread loaf crumb score were all correlated, suggesting similar gene control for these traits; however, specific additive locus contributions were evident: αB for flour yield; αB and αD for flour protein; and αB for absorption, but differing in sign; all three loci for mixing time, but αB was negative; and all three loci were positively associated with loaf volume. Digenic epistatic effects were significant for flour yield (αAD), flour protein (αAB), and absorption and mixing time (αAD, αBD). Only flour yield showed a trigenic epistatic effect. Six of seven epistatic effects were negative, thus showing how progress in breeding for high quality may be impeded by interaction of genes which, by themselves, have strong positive additive effects. Considerable genetic variance among RILs within a HMW-glu genotype was detected for all traits, and the summation of α effects accounted for a mean of 13% of the parental differences for the six traits examined in this study. Clearly, further resolution of the genetics of wheat quality would be desirable from a plant breeding point of view."
"26925326","articletitle","Influence of whole-wheat consumption on fecal microbial community structure of obese diabetic mice."
"26925326","abstracttext","The digestive tract of mammals and other animals is colonized by trillions of metabolically-active microorganisms. Changes in the gut microbiota have been associated with obesity in both humans and laboratory animals. Dietary modifications can often modulate the obese gut microbial ecosystem towards a more healthy state. This phenomenon should preferably be studied using dietary ingredients that are relevant to human nutrition. This study was designed to evaluate the influence of whole-wheat, a food ingredient with several beneficial properties, on gut microorganisms of obese diabetic mice. Diabetic (db/db) mice were fed standard (obese-control) or whole-wheat isocaloric diets (WW group) for eight weeks; non-obese mice were used as control (lean-control). High-throughput sequencing using the MiSeq platform coupled with freely-available computational tools and quantitative real-time PCR were used to analyze fecal bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences. Short-chain fatty acids were measured in caecal contents using quantitative high-performance liquid chromatography photo-diode array analysis. Results showed no statistical difference in final body weights between the obese-control and the WW group. The bacterial richness (number of Operational Taxonomic Units) did not differ among the treatment groups. The abundance of Ruminococcaceae, a family containing several butyrate-producing bacteria, was found to be higher in obese (median: 6.9%) and WW-supplemented mice (5.6%) compared to lean (2.7%, p = 0.02, Kruskal-Wallis test). Caecal concentrations of butyrate were higher in obese (average: 2.91 mmol/mg of feces) but especially in WW-supplemented mice (4.27 mmol/mg) compared to lean controls (0.97 mmol/mg), while caecal succinic acid was lower in the WW group compared to obese but especially to the lean group. WW consumption was associated with ∼3 times higher abundances of Lactobacillus spp. compared to both obese and lean control mice. Analysis of weighted UniFrac distances revealed a distinctive clustering of lean microbial communities separately from both obese and WW-supplemented mice (p = 0.001, ANOSIM test). Predictive metagenome analysis revealed significant differences in several metabolic features of the microbiota among the treatment groups, including carbohydrate, amino acids and vitamin metabolism (p < 0.01, Kruskal-Wallis test). However, obese and WW groups tended to share more similar abundances of gene families compared to lean mice. Using an in vivo model of obesity and diabetes, this study suggests that daily WW supplementation for eight weeks may not be enough to influence body weight or to output a lean-like microbiome, both taxonomically and metabolically. However, WW-supplementation was associated with several statistically significant differences in the gut microbiome compared to obese controls that deserve further investigation."
"30030224","articletitle","Pseudomonas chlororaphis Produces Multiple R-Tailocin Particles That Broaden the Killing Spectrum and Contribute to Persistence in Rhizosphere Communities."
"30030224","abstracttext","R-tailocins are high-molecular-weight bacteriocins resembling bacteriophage tails. Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84 is a plant growth-promoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) strain that produces two distinct R-tailocin particles with different killing spectra. The two R-tailocins have different evolutionary histories but are released by the same lysis cassette. A previous study showed that both tailocins are important for pairwise competition with susceptible rhizosphere-colonizing strains; however, the broader role of tailocins in competition with the native rhizosphere microbiome was not tested. Genomic analysis of the P. chlororaphis 30-84 R-tailocin gene cluster uncovered the presence of three tail fiber genes in the tailocin 2 genetic module that could potentially result in tailocin 2 particles having different tail fibers and thus a wider killing spectrum. In this study, the tail fibers were found to incorporate onto different tailocin 2 particles, each with a distinct killing spectrum. A loss of production of one or both tailocins resulted in decreased P. chlororaphis 30-84 persistence within the wheat rhizosphere when in competition with the native microflora but not bulk soil. The capacity to produce three different versions of a single tailocin, each having one of three different types of tail fibers, is a previously unreported mechanism that leads to a broader R-tailocin killing spectrum. This study also provides evidence for the function of R-tailocins in competition with rhizosphere microbiome communities but not in bulk soil. IMPORTANCE Although R-tailocin gene clusters typically encode one tail fiber protein, three tail fiber-resembling genes were identified in association with one of the two sets of R-tailocin genes within the tailocin cluster of P. chlororaphis 30-84 and other sequenced P. chlororaphis strain genomes. This study confirmed that P. chlororaphis 30-84 not only produces two distinct tailocins, but that one of them is produced with three different types of tail fibers. This is a previously unreported strategy to increase the breadth of strains targeted by an R-tailocin. Our finding that R-tailocins produced by a PGPR Pseudomonas strain enhanced its persistence within the wheat rhizosphere microbiome confirms that R-tailocin production contributes to the population dynamics of rhizobacterial communities."
"30727416","articletitle","First Report of a New TTKSF Race of Wheat Stem Rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) in South Africa and Zimbabwe."
"30727416","abstracttext","Seven races have been described in the Ug99 race group of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (2). Ug99-related races previously recorded in South Africa are TTKSF, TTKSP, and PTKST (4). In December 2010, severe stem rust infection of the winter wheat cv. Matlabas was observed for the first time in South Africa. Race analysis using the 20 North American (NA) stem rust differential lines and letter code system classified the race as TTKSF. In comparative infection studies in a greenhouse, cv. Matlabas seedlings were susceptible (infection type [IT] 4) to isolate UVPgt61/1 (TTKSF+) collected from Afrikaskop in the eastern Free State, whereas the cultivar was resistant (IT 1 to 2) to stem rust isolates 2013 (TTKSF), UVPgt55 (TTKSF), UVPgt59 (TTKSP), and UVPgt60 (PTKST). Isolate 2013 represents the original collection of race TTKSF in South Africa (1). In addition to the NA differentials, no variation in the IT range of seedlings of lines with Sr7a, 8b, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18, 19, 22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 35, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, Em, R, Tt2, and Satu was observed between UVPgt61/1 and UVPgt55. With the exception of cv. Matlabas, ITs of 106 South African cultivars likewise did not differentiate UVPgt61/1 and UVPgt55. Seedling IT studies were conducted at least twice. Microsatellite analysis (4) showed that all single pustule isolates established from the original Matlabas isolate formed part of the Ug99 group. When characterized with selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), all single pustule isolates shared an identical genotype that differed from UVPgt55 (TTKSF), a foreign introduction into South Africa (1,3). SNP genotype analysis suggests that UVPgt61/1 is genetically dissimilar to UVPgt55, as is Zim1009, another TTKSF+ isolate that was collected from Birchenough in Zimbabwe. Studies are underway to determine the identity of the defeated Sr gene in Matlabas and the cultivar has been added to the South African stem rust differential set. TTKSF+ is the eighth race detected in the Ug99 group. Since no other cultivars or advanced lines were found to carry the Matlabas gene, it is unlikely that race TTKSF+ will threaten wheat production in South Africa. However, the occurrence of a new Ug99-related race emphasizes the variability within this internationally important group. References: (1) W. H. P. Boshoff et al. Plant Dis. 86:922, 2002. (2) R. F.

"30524385","abstracttext","Acidic ash derived volcanic soils (Andisols) support 50% of cereal production in Chile. Nitrogen (N) is essential for cereal crops and commonly added as urea with consequent environmental concerns due to leaching. Despite the relevance of N to plant growth, few studies have focused on understanding the application, management and ecological role of N 2 -fixing bacterial populations as tool for improve the N nutrition of cereal crops in Chile. It is known that N 2 -fixing bacteria commonly inhabits diverse plant compartments (e.g., rhizosphere and root endosphere) where they can supply N for plant growth. Here, we used culture-independent and dependent approaches to characterize and compare the putative N 2 -fixing bacteria associated with the rhizosphere and root endosphere of wheat plants grown in an Andisol from southern Chile. Our results showed significantly greater bacterial loads in the rhizosphere than the root endosphere. Quantitative PCR results indicated that the copy number of the 16S rRNA gene ranged from 10 12 ~10 13 and 10 7 ~10 8 g -1 sample in rhizosphere and root endosphere, respectively. The nif H gene copy number ranged from 10 5 ~10 6 and 10 5 g -1 sample in rhizosphere and root endosphere, respectively. The total culturable bacteria number ranged from 10 9 ~10 10 and 10 7 ~10 8 CFU g -1 sample in rhizosphere and 10 4 ~10 5 and 10 4 CFU g -1 sample in root endosphere using LB and NM-1 media, respectively. Indirect counts of putative N 2 -fixing bacteria were 10 3 and 10 2 ~10 3 CFU g -1 sample in rhizosphere and root endosphere using NFb medium, respectively. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes from randomly selected putative N 2 -fixing bacteria revealed the presence of members of Proteobacteria ( Bosea and Roseomonas ), Actinobacteria ( Georgenia, Mycobacterium, Microbacterium, Leifsonia , and Arthrobacter ), Bacteroidetes ( Chitinophaga ) and Firmicutes ( Bacillus and Psychrobacillus ) taxa. Differences in 16S rRNA and putative nif H-containing bacterial communities between rhizosphere and root endosphere were shown by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). This study shows a compartmentalization between rhizosphere and root endosphere for both the abundance and diversity of total (16S rRNA) and putative N 2 -fixing bacterial communities on wheat plants grown in Chilean Andisols. This information can be relevant for the design and application of agronomic strategies to enhance sustainable N-utilization in cereal crops in Chile."

"1325206","abstracttext","The rye-specific R173 family of repeated DNA sequences consists of ca. 15,000 individual copies per diploid rye (Secale cereale) genome and is distributed over all 7 rye chromosomes in a dispersed manner. Individual R173 elements vary in size between 3 and 6 kb, are generally not arranged as tandem repeats and are flanked by both multi-copy and single-copy sequences. DNA sequence analysis of three R173 elements (R173-1, R173-2 and R173-3) demonstrated a high degree of homology in conserved domains. The structure of R173-1 was quite different from the other two elements: long direct repeats, which represent a rye-specific repetitive sequence, were found at the ends and a 600 bp long domain was replaced by an unrelated sequence of approximately equal size. R173-2 and R173-3 were extremely similar to each other with the exception of a terminal truncation of R173-2. No open reading frames for proteins greater than 20 kDa were present and a database search failed to detect significant homologies to published protein sequences. Despite the transposon like genomic organisation of the R173 family, individual elements lacked sequence features frequently associated with transposons and retrotransposons. In contrast, two of the regions flanking R173 elements showed strong DNA homologies to a 850 bp long region of a proposed wheat retrotransposon and to a 300 bp long region downstream of the wheat Glu-D1 gene."

"2675976","abstracttext","Factors for efficient synthesis of mRNA in vitro and its subsequent translation in cell free lysates from reticulocyte and wheat germ were studied using yeast invertase as a probe. Among various transcription systems tested, containing either SP6, T5, T7 or a bacterial synthetic consensus promoter, the T7 system was superior both from a quantitative and qualitative point of view. Transcription with SP6 polymerase, but not with the other enzymes, resulted in premature transcript termination, which is ascribed to a sensitivity of the SP6 polymerase towards a hairpin loop structure in the invertase coding region. In-frame fusion of the critical DNA sequence to a different gene promoted premature transcription termination of the resulting chimeric template, which in its original form is transcribed correctly. Transcripts with additional sequences 5' upstream of the natural translation start revealed a diminished protein synthesis presumably due to the presence of out of frame ATG codons. In contrast, no influence on translation was found when additional sequences at the 3' end were present or when the stop codon was missing. Capping of transcripts was essential for translation in wheat germ lysates, whereas protein synthesis in reticulocytes was only reduced in the absence of a cap. The influence of polyadenylation on translation was studied using transcripts with engineered poly(A) tracts of different size. Increasing poly(A) chain length abolished translation in vitro in both translation systems. Inhibition was poly(A)-specific and is discussed as interference of the poly(A) sequences with a crucial component(s) of the protein synthesis machinery."

"7567453","abstracttext","Ribonuclease H (RNase H) which recognizes and cleaves the RNA strand of mismatched RNA-DNA heteroduplexes can induce non-specific effects of antisense oligonucleotides. In a previous paper [Larrouy et al. (1992), Gene, 121, 189-194], we demonstrated that ODN1, a phosphodiester 15mer targeted to the AUG initiation region of alpha-globin mRNA, inhibited non-specifically beta-globin synthesis in wheat germ extract due to RNase H-mediated cleavage of beta-globin mRNA. Specificity was restored by using MP-ODN2, a methylphosphonate-phosphodiester sandwich analogue of ODN1, which limited RNase H activity on non-perfect hybrids. We report here that 2'-O-alkyl RNA-phosphodiester DNA sandwich analogues of ODN1, with the same phosphodiester window as MP-ODN2, are non-specific inhibitors of globin synthesis in wheat germ extract, whatever the substituent (methyl, allyl or butyl) on the 2'-OH. These sandwich oligomers induced the cleavage of non-target beta-globin RNA sites, similarly to the unmodified parent oligomer ODN1. This is likely due to the increased affinity of 2'-O-alkyl-ODN2 chimeric oligomers for both fully and partly complementary RNA, compared to MP-ODN2. In contrast, the fully modified 2'-O-methyl analogue of ODN1 was a very effective and highly specific antisense sequence. This was ascribed to its inability (i) to induce RNA cleavage by RNase H and (ii) to physically prevent the elongation of the polypeptide chain."

"8984007","abstracttext","A cloned repetitive sequence, pAvKB30, obtained from an Avena vaviloviana (AB genome) genomic library, along with two polymerase chain reaction products derived from the conserved region of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene of retrotransposons, were characterized molecularly and cytologically. The cloned DNA fragment was a dispersed repeat present in all Avena species used in this study (A. strigosa, A. clauda, A. vaviloviana, A. magna, and A. sativa). The fragment was sequenced (210 bp) and found to be 69.5% homologous to part of WIS-2-1A, and 60.5% homologous to the leader sequence of BARE-1; both of these elements have been characterized as Ty1-copia-like retrotransposons in wheat and barley, respectively. In situ hybridization of pAvKB30 to diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid oat species revealed that the probe is present on both arms of all chromosomes (A, B, C, and D genomes) but is excluded from their centromeric and nucleolar organizer regions. By using double in situ hybridization in hexaploid A. sativa (ACD genome), pAvKB30 was found to be present in lower copy numbers in C-genome chromosomes compared with A- and D-genome chromosomes. Furthermore, under low stringency conditions, pAvKB30 hybridized on Southern blots containing barley, wheat, rye, and Arrhenatherum DNA. However, under high stringency conditions, it hybridized only on Arrhenatherum DNA, which is considered to be the genus most closely related to Avena. All Avena species included in this study yielded a PCR product when the primers from the RT domain of retrotransposons were used. Two products, rtA, obtained by using A. strigosa (A(s) genome) as template, and rtC, obtained by using A. clauda (Cp genome) as template, gave Southern and in situ hybridization results similar to pAvKB30, but each was more abundant in its genome of origin."

"8940135","abstracttext","The promoter of the wheat Em gene contains elements with a CACGTG core sequence (G-boxes), which are recognized by EmBP-1, a wheat basic/leucine zipper (bZIP) protein. G-boxes are required for Em expression in response to the phytohormone abscisic acid and for transactivation by the Viviparous-1 protein (VP1) using transient expression systems. In order to identify other factors that are part of the transcriptional complex that associates with G-boxes, we have screened a rice (Oryza sativa) cDNA library with biotinylated EmBP-1. We have isolated osZIP-1a, a homolog of EmBP-1 and other plant G-box-binding factors. We show that EmBP-1 and osZIP-1a will preferentially heterodimerize in vitro. Overexpression of osZIP-1a in rice protoplasts can enhance expression from the Em promoter only in the presence of abscisic acid. Two other clones have been identified by screening with EmBP-1: osZIP-2a and osZIP-2b. These osZIP-2 factors represent a novel class of bZIP proteins with an unusual DNA-binding domain that does not recognize G-boxes. The osZIP-2 factors can heterodimerize with EmBP-1 and prevent it from binding to the Em promoter. Interestingly, osZIP-1a does not heterodimerize with the osZIP-2 factors and its DNA binding activity is unaffected by their presence. Thus, osZIP-2 factors may be involved in sequestering a particular group of G-box-binding factors into inactive heterodimers."

"9148938","abstracttext","In eukaryotic cells, pre-tRNAs spliced by a pathway that produces a 3',5'-phosphodiester, 2'-phosphomonoester linkage contain a 2'-phosphate group adjacent to the tRNA anticodon. This 2'-phosphate is transferred to NAD to give adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose 1"", 2""-cyclic phosphate (Appr>p), which is subsequently metabolized to ADP-ribose 1""-phosphate (Appr-1""p). The latter reaction is catalyzed by a cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPDase), previously identified in yeast and wheat. In the work presented here, we describe cloning of the Arabidopsis cDNA encoding the 20-kDa CPDase that hydrolyzes Appr>p to Appr-1""p. Properties of the bacterially overexpressed and purified Arabidopsis enzyme are similar to those of wheat CPDase. In addition to their transformation of Appr>p, both enzymes hydrolyze nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphates to nucleoside 2'-phosphates. For the Arabidopsis CPDase, the apparent Km values for Appr>p, A>p, C>p, G>p, and U>p are 1.35, 1.34, 2.38, 16.86, and 17.67 mM, respectively. Southern analysis indicated that CPDase in Arabidopsis is encoded by a single copy gene that is expressed, at different levels, in all Arabidopsis organs that were analyzed. Indirect immunofluorescence, performed with transfected protoplasts, showed that CPDase is localized in the cytoplasm. Based on substrate specificity and products generated, the plant enzyme differs from other known cyclic phosphodiesterases. The Arabidopsis CPDase does not have recognizable structural similarity or motifs in common with proteins deposited in public data bases."

"9018138","abstracttext","Wheat dwarf virus (WDV) is a representative member of subgroup I of the Geminiviridae, a unique plant DNA virus family. Since geminivirus DNA replication occurs in the host cell nucleus exclusively via double-stranded DNA intermediates, a considerable interest has arisen to use them as expression vectors. We have used particle bombardment to introduce WDV vectors into cultured wheat cells and to analyze the fate of input DNA and the accumulation of newly replicated DNA. Under our conditions, we have found that input DNA, which can be detected immediately after DNA delivery, is rapidly degraded. Newly replicated viral DNA appears approximately 1 day after DNA delivery and reaches a maximum at Days 2-4. Afterward, the total amount of viral DNA is maintained for several days. We have observed a progressive decrease in the relative amount of supercoiled DNA and, concomitantly, an increase in plasmid forms migrating as open circular and nicked DNA. GUS expression from the virion-sense WDV promoter is also maximal 2-3 days after DNA delivery and then it declines to negligible levels 8 days afterward. These results support the conclusion that, under these conditions, reporter gene expression depends on the accumulation of newly replicated, supercoiled plasmid DNA and not on input plasmid DNA. We have also analyzed the effects of WDV origin structure and plasmid size on the accumulation of newly replicated plasmid DNA. Our results lead us to conclude that the replication efficiency of WDV-derived plasmids depends largely on plasmid size. Interestingly, sequences downstream of the initiation site, which in WDV confer an intrinsic curvature to the large intergenic region, seem to have a small effect on the efficiency of plasmid accumulation."

"8419375","abstracttext","In eukaryotes, conjugation of ubiquitin to proteins serves as a committed step for intracellular protein degradation. Formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates involves the transfer of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2)-bound ubiquitin to the target proteins with or without the assistance of ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3). We report the isolation and characterization of an E2 purified from wheat germ that accounts for the majority of ubiquitin conjugation activity observed in vitro. This E2 is basic, has an apparent molecular mass of 15 kDa, and forms oligomers that dissociate upon treatment with sulfhydryl reducing agents. E(2)15kDa will not work alone in vitro but requires an additional factor putatively identified as an E3 for substrate recognition. This E3 is distinct from E3 alpha previously described to be required for N-terminal recognition of target proteins. Partial amino acid sequence analysis of E(2)15kDa revealed a substantial identity (approximately 80% in two peptide regions) with yeast E2s encoded by UBC4/UBC5 genes. This homology was confirmed by immunodetection of a 16-kDa yeast protein corresponding to the molecular mass of the UBC4/UBC5 proteins with E(2)15kDa antisera. The products of yeast UBC4 and UBC5 genes along with that of UBC1 gene constitute a subfamily of functionally overlapping E2s that mediate the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal proteins in vivo. Considering the high degree of functional and structural similarity of wheat E(2)15kDa with that of yeast UBC4/UBC5, it is likely that yeast UBC4/UBC5 and their homologs from other eukaryotes exhibit the same E3 dependence in performing their roles in protein degradation."

"8624405","abstracttext","Protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.77) that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to abnormal L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl residues in a variety of peptides and proteins are widely distributed in procaryotes and eucaryotes. These enzymes participate in the repair of spontaneous protein damage by facilitating the conversion of L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl residues to normal L-aspartyl residues. In this work, we have identified an L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase activity in Arabidopsis thaliana, a dicotyledonous plant of the mustard family. The highest levels of activity were detected in seeds. Using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to two highly conserved amino acid regions shared among the Escherichia coli, wheat, and human enzymes, we isolated and sequenced a full-length genomic clone encoding the A. thaliana methyltransferase. Several methyltransferase cDNAs were also characterized, including ones that would encode full-length polypeptides of 230 amino acid residues. Messenger RNAs for the A. thaliana enzyme were found in a variety of tissues that did not contain significant amounts of active enzyme suggesting the possibility of translational or posttranslational controls on methyltransferase levels. We have identified a putative abscisic acid-response element (ABRE) in the 5'-untranslated region of the A. thaliana L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase gene and have shown that the expression of the mRNA is responsive to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but not to the environmental stresses of salt or drought. The expression of the A. thaliana enzyme appears to be regulated in a distinct fashion from that seen in wheat or in animal tissues."
"10377994","articletitle","A role for glutathione transferases functioning as glutathione peroxidases in resistance to multiple herbicides in black-grass."
"10377994","abstracttext","Black-grass (Alopecurus myosuroides) is a major weed of wheat in Europe, with several populations having acquired resistance to multiple herbicides of differing modes of action. As compared with herbicide-susceptible black-grass, populations showing herbicide cross-resistance contained greatly elevated levels of a specific type I glutathione transferase (GST), termed AmGST2, but similar levels of a type III GST termed AmGST1. Following cloning and expression of the respective cDNAs, AmGST2 differed from AmGST1 in showing limited activity in detoxifying herbicides but high activities as a glutathione peroxidase (GPOX) capable of reducing organic hydroperoxides. In contrast to AmGST2, other GPOXs were not enhanced in the herbicide-resistant populations. Treatment with a range of herbicides used to control grass weeds in wheat resulted in increased levels of hydroperoxides in herbicide-susceptible populations but not in herbicide-resistant plants, consistent with AmGST2 functioning to prevent oxidative injury caused as a primary or secondary effect of herbicide action. Increased AmGST2 expression in black-grass was associated with partial tolerance to the peroxidizing herbicide paraquat. The selective enhancement of AmGST2 expression resulted from a constitutively high expression of the respective gene, which was activated in herbicide-susceptible black-grass in response to herbicide safeners, dehydration and chemical treatments imposing oxidative stress. Our results provide strong evidence that GSTs can contribute to resistance to multiple herbicides by playing a role in oxidative stress tolerance in addition to detoxifying herbicides by catalysing their conjugation with glutathione."
"9291116","articletitle","Tissue-specific promoters of the alpha human folate receptor gene yield transcripts with divergent 5' leader sequences and different translational efficiencies."
"9291116","abstracttext","The alpha human folate receptor (alphahFR), or KB cell folate receptor, gene contains two major promoters that produce transcripts, KB1 and KB4, varying only in the length and sequence of their 5' untranslated regions (UTRs). Using RNase protection assays specific for each isoform, we show that the level of expression of these two transcripts is tissue-specific, indicating that promoter usage is regulated, not constitutive. RNA stabilities and translational efficiencies of the KB1 and KB4 transcripts were compared to determine the functional significance of the different 5' UTRs. Analyses of RNA turnover in vivo with actinomycin D to block new transcription and in vitro with a cytoplasmic extract indicate no discernible differences in the stabilities of the two transcripts. However, the KB4 transcript is 2-3-fold more efficiently translated in wheat germ extracts in vitro and transfected CHO cells in vivo. Also, high ionic strength, which favours the formation of RNA secondary structure, differentially affects the translational efficiencies of the two transcripts. Translation of the longer KB1 mRNA is 2-5-fold more inhibited by hypertonic conditions than translation of the KB4 mRNA. Because the 5' UTR of KB1 is approximately four times longer than the 5' UTR of KB4, 149 bp (75%) of the KB1 5' UTR were deleted to determine whether the long leader sequence inhibited translation. The resulting derivative, dKB1, has a 5' UTR similar in length, but not sequence, to the 5' UTR of KB4. dKB1 is translated at a level approaching that of KB4 in wheat germ extracts, indicating that the upstream portion of the 5' leader sequence contributes to the relative translational inefficiency of KB1. Hence, one consequence of tissue-specific promoter usage is the production of alphahFR transcripts with different 5' non-coding regions that affect translational efficiency."
"9680998","articletitle","Transcription of Arabidopsis and wheat Cab genes in single tobacco transgenic seedlings exhibits independent rhythms in a developmentally regulated fashion."
"9680998","abstracttext","Transcription of Cab genes has been previously shown to be regulated by a circadian oscillator coupled to the red light-absorbing plant photoreceptor phytochrome in various plant species. In addition, it has recently been suggested that rhythmic expression of the Cab genes could also be affected by a phytochrome-independent circadian oscillator in a developmentally regulated fashion. This study has shown that a red light-insensitive oscillator and a phytochrome-coupled circadian clock indeed coregulate the oscillating expression of individual Cab genes at the level of transcription at an early developmental stage. The study involved analysing the expression patterns of transgenes, containing short fragments of the Arabidopsis thaliana Cab2 or the wheat Cab-1 promoter fused to the firefly luciferase reporter gene, by a video-imaging system in single, etiolated tobacco seedlings. Germination and red/far-red light treatments applied between 12 and 36 h after sowing lead to the appearance of two independent circadian rhythms. These rhythms coexist, both exhibiting period lengths close to 25 h but phased differently. However, repeated red-light treatments given 60 h or later after sowing synchronize these free-running rhythms and induce a single new circadian oscillation. These data indicate that both oscillators regulate the expression of the Cab genes studied at the level of transcription and that the cis-acting element(s) of the wheat Cab-1 and A. thaliana Cab2 genes mediating these responses are located on short, 250 bp promoter regions. Furthermore, these red-light induced rhythms are also inducible by far-red light treatments alone. Therefore, in tobacco, the phytochrome-coupled oscillator is regulated, at least partially, by the very low fluence response of phytochrome A."

In this study, fluorescent Pseudomonas strains containing phlD, which is directly involved in the biosynthesis of 2,4-DAPG, were isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat grown in soils from wheat-growing regions of the United States and The Netherlands. To assess the genotypic and phenotypic diversity present in this collection, 138 isolates were compared to 4 previously described 2, 4-DAPG producers. Thirteen distinct genotypes, one of which represented over 30% of the isolates, were differentiated by whole-cell BOX-PCR. Representatives of this group were isolated from eight different soils taken from four different geographic locations. ERIC-PCR gave similar results overall, differentiating 15 distinct genotypes among all of the isolates. In most cases, a single genotype predominated among isolates obtained from each soil. Thirty isolates, representing all of the distinct genotypes and geographic locations, were further characterized. Restriction analysis of amplified 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed only three distinct phylogenetic groups, one of which accounted for 87% of the isolates. Phenotypic analyses based on carbon source utilization profiles revealed that all of the strains utilized 49 substrates and were unable to grow on 12 others. Individually, strains could utilize about two-thirds of the 95 substrates present in Biolog SF-N plates. Multivariate analyses of utilization profiles revealed phenotypic groupings consistent with those defined by the genotypic analyses."

"10788397","abstracttext","The effect of a mutation affecting flocculation, differentiation into cyst-like forms, and root colonization on nitrogenase expression by Azospirillum brasilense is described. The gene flcA of strain Sp7 restored these phenotypes in spontaneous mutants of both strains Sp7 and Sp245. Employing both constitutive pLA-lacZ and nifH-lacZ reporter fusions expressed in situ, the colony morphology, colonization pattern, and potential for nitrogenase activity of spontaneous mutants and flcA Tn5-induced mutants were established. The results of this study show that the ability of Sp7 and Sp245 mutant strains to remain in a vegetative form improved their ability to express nitrogenase activity in association with wheat in a hydroponic system. Restoring the cyst formation and colonization pattern to the spontaneous mutant Sp7-S reduced nitrogenase activity rates in association with plants to that of the wild-type Sp7. Although Tn5-induced flcA mutants showed higher potentials for nitrogenase expression than Sp7, their potentials were lower than that of Sp7-S, indicating that other factors in this strain contribute to its exceptional nitrogenase activity rates on plants. The lack of lateral flagella is not one of these factors, as Sp7-PM23, a spontaneous mutant impaired in swarming and lateral-flagellum production but not in flocculation, showed wild-type nitrogenase activity and expression. The results also suggest factors of importance in evolving an effective symbiosis between Azospirillum and wheat, such as increasing the availability of microaerobic niches along the root, increased supply of carbon sources by the plant, and the retention of the bacterial cells in vegetative form for faster metabolism."

"11807238","abstracttext","Monopartite members of the family Potyviridae utilize three virus-encoded proteinases to cleave the viral polyprotein into mature proteins. The amino-terminal region of the viral polyprotein is autolytically cleaved by the P1 proteinase. A domain required for P1 proteinase activity of Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) was mapped using a series of templates with nested 3'-truncations or 5'-deletions to program in vitro transcription-translation reactions. The WSMV P1 proteinase cleavage site was mapped to a position downstream of amino acid residue 348 and upstream of amino acid residue 353, with the peptide bond between amino acid residues Y(352) and G(353) the most probable site of hydrolysis. An alignment of potyvirus polyprotein sequences in the carboxy-terminal region of the P1 domain revealed WSMV P1 contained conserved H(257), D(267), S(303) and FIVXG(325-329) residues upstream of the cleavage site that are typical of serine proteinases and shown by others to be required for P1 proteolysis in Tobacco etch virus. Insertion of the GUS reporter gene immediately downstream of the P1 cleavage site in a full-length clone of WSMV resulted in systemic infection and GUS expression upon inoculation of plants with in vitro transcripts. When cleaved by P1 at the amino terminus and NIa proteinase at a site engineered in the carboxy-terminus, active GUS protein expressed by WSMV in infected wheat had electrophoretic mobility similar to wild-type GUS protein."

Alleles at 158 AFLP loci and the mating-type locus segregated in a 1:1 ratio. Ten unlinked markers were chosen to determine genetic and genotypic diversity and to test the hypothesis of random mating and population differentiation among five subpopulations of T. yallundae representative of the geographical distribution of wheat production in eastern Washington. Among 228 isolates collected, overall gene diversity was high (h = 0.425) and a total of 91 unique multilocus genotypes (MLG) were identified, with 32 MLG occurring at least twice. The overall population genetic structure was consistent with random mating based on the segregation of mating-type, index of association (IA), parsimony tree length permutation test (PTLPT) and genotypic diversity analyses. However, clonal genotypes were found within each subpopulation and were also distributed among the five subpopulations. No significant differences in allele frequencies were found among the five subpopulations for all 10 loci based on contingency table analysis (G2) and Wier & Cockerham's population differentiation statistic theta (theta = -0.008, P = 0.722). T. yallundae appears to consist of a large homogeneous population throughout eastern Washington with both sexual and asexual reproduction contributing to the observed population genetic structure despite no report of sexual fruiting bodies of T. yallundae occurring under natural field conditions."

"12122010","abstracttext","The molecular mechanisms of cold acclimation are still largely unknown; however, it has been established that overwintering plants such as winter wheat increases freeze tolerance during cold treatments. In prokaryotes, cold shock proteins are induced by temperature downshifts and have been proposed to function as RNA chaperones. A wheat cDNA encoding a putative nucleic acid-binding protein, WCSP1, was isolated and found to be homologous to the predominant CspA of Escherichia coli. The putative WCSP1 protein contains a three-domain structure consisting of an N-terminal cold shock domain with two internal conserved consensus RNA binding domains and an internal glycine-rich region, which is interspersed with three C-terminal CX(2)CX(4)HX(4)C (CCHC) zinc fingers. Each domain has been described independently within several nucleotide-binding proteins. Northern and Western blot analyses showed that WCSP1 mRNA and protein levels steadily increased during cold acclimation, respectively. WCSP1 induction was cold-specific because neither abscisic acid treatment, drought, salinity, nor heat stress induced WCSP1 expression. Nucleotide binding assays determined that WCSP1 binds ssDNA, dsDNA, and RNA homopolymers. The capacity to bind dsDNA was nearly eliminated in a mutant protein lacking C-terminal zinc fingers. Structural and expression similarities to E. coli CspA suggest that WCSP1 may be involved in gene regulation during cold acclimation."
"12671743","articletitle","Mapping of quantitative trait loci for field resistance to Fusarium head blight in an European winter wheat."
"12671743","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium culmorum is an economically important disease of wheat that may cause serious yield and quality losses under favorable climate conditions. The development of disease-resistant cultivars is the most effective control strategy. Worldwide, there is heavy reliance on the resistance pool originating from Asian wheats, but excellent field resistance has also been observed among European winter wheats. The objective of this study was to map and characterize quantitative traits loci (QTL) of resistance to FHB among European winter wheats. A population of 194 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was genotyped from a cross between two winter wheats Renan (resistant)/Récital (susceptible) with microsatellites, AFLP and RFLP markers. RILs were assessed under field conditions For 3 years in one location. Nine QTLs were detected, and together they explained 30-45% of the variance, depending on the year. Three of the QTLs were stable over the 3 years. One stable QTL, QFhs.inra.2b, was mapped to chromosome 2B and two QTLs QFhs.inra.5a2 and QFhs.inra5a3, to chromosome 5A; each of these QTLs explained 6.9-18.6% of the variance. Other QTLs were identified on chromosome 2A, 3A, 3B, 5D, and 6D, but these had a smaller effect on FHB resistance. One of the two QTLs on chromosome 5A was linked to gene B1 controlling the presence of awns. Overlapping QTLs for FHB resistance were those for plant height or/and flowering time. Our results confirm that wheat chromosomes 2A, 3A, 3B, and 5A carry FHB resistance genes, and new resistance factors were identified on chromosome arms 2BS and 5AL. Markers flanking these QTLs should be useful tools for combining the resistance to FHB of Asian and European wheats to increase the resistance level of cultivars."

"12934018","abstracttext","Cystathionine gamma-synthase, the first committed enzyme of methionine biosynthesis in higher plants, is encoded by the CGS1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. We have shown previously that the stability of the CGS1 mRNA is negatively regulated in response to methionine application [Chiba, Y., Ishikawa, M., Kijima, F., Tyson, R. H., Kim, J., Yamamoto, A., Nambara, E., Leustek, T., Wallsgrove, R. M. & Naito, S. (1999) Science 286, 1371-1374]. To determine whether methionine itself is the effector of the CGS1 exon 1-mediated posttranscriptional regulation, we carried out transfection experiments. The results suggested that, rather than methionine, S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet), or one of its metabolites, acts as the effector of this regulation. To further identify the actual effector, we exploited the wheat germ in vitro translation system. The effects of various metabolites and analogs of AdoMet were tested by using RNA carrying a CGS1 exon 1-reporter fusion. These tests identified AdoMet as the effector of this regulation. S-adenosyl-L-ethionine, an analog of AdoMet, also had effector activity. A. thaliana mto1 mutants, which are deficient in this regulation, showed a much reduced response to AdoMet in vitro, with a leaky allele showing a less reduced response. RNA translated in vitro in the presence of AdoMet contained a 5'-truncated RNA species, similar to the one that we previously suggested was an in vivo degradation intermediate of CGS1 mRNA. Together, the results show that the basic reactions of CGS1 exon 1-mediated posttranscriptional regulation occur in the wheat germ in vitro translation system, and that AdoMet acts as the effector."

"15840936","abstracttext","The dominant male sterility gene Ms2 in wheat has been widely used in recurrent selection and variety improvement. Identification of genes associated with the male sterility in Ms2-carrying wheat will help us understand how Ms2 functions. Using a pair of isogenic lines of Ms2, subtractive hybridization was conducted with cDNA from bulked spikelets at meiophase of sterile plants as the tester and cDNA from the same tissues of fertile plants as the driver. Two major bands at 270 bp and 450 bp were obtained by suppression PCR (polymerase chain reaction) of the subtractive cDNA. A total of 882 recombinants from PCR product cloning were isolated for reverse Northern analysis. The results demonstrated that up to 90% of the inserts in the library were up-regulated in the sterile spikelets. Twenty-one unique inserts from this library were sequenced. Similarity search showed that eighteen of them were homologous to ESTs (expression sequence tags) derived from spike or anther tissues at meiophase. The chromosome locations of nine of the ESTs were determined using C.S. (Chinese spring) nulli-tetrasomic lines, one of which was assigned to chromosome group 4 that includes chromosome 4D where Ms2 is located. In addition, four additional ESTs could also be assigned to this group according to their homology to BACs (bacterial artificial chromosomes) or PAC (P1 artificial chromosomes) of rice chromosome 3. The expression patterns of eight of the inserts examined displayed increased expression in spikelets and anthers of the sterile plants."
"15841362","articletitle","Genetic analysis of durable resistance to yellow rust in bread wheat."
"15841362","abstracttext","Yellow rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis, is one of the most damaging diseases affecting bread wheat in temperate regions. Although resistance to yellow rust is frequently overcome by new virulent races, a durable form of resistance in the French bread wheat Camp Remy (CR) has remained effective since its introduction in 1980. We used 217 F7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between CR and the susceptible cultivar Recital to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in durable yellow rust resistance. Six significant QTLs that were stable over a 4-year period were detected. Two QTLs, denoted QYr.inra-2DS and QYr.inra-5BL.2, were located on the short arm of chromosome 2D and the long arm of chromosome 5B, respectively. Each explained on average 25-35% of the observed phenotypic variation and were probably inherited from Cappelle Desprez, a parent of CR that confers durable adult plant resistance to yellow rust. QYr.inra-2DS probably corresponds to the Yr16 gene. The most consistent QTL, designated QYr.inra-2BL, was located on the centromeric region of chromosome 2B and explained 61% of the phenotypic variation in 2003. This QTL was responsible for seedling-stage resistance and may correspond to a cluster of genes, including Yr7. The remaining QTLs were mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2B (R2=22-70%) and to the long arm of chromosomes 2A (R2=0.20-0.40) and 5B (R2=0.18-0.26). This specific combination of seedling and adult plant resistance genes found in CR and CD may constitute the key to their durable resistance against yellow rust."

"16099920","abstracttext","Multiple synonymous substitution mutations in the Wheat streak mosaic virus P3 cistron did not affect translation in vitro but rendered the virus incapable of systemic infection. Multiple synonymous substitutions in the cylindrical inclusion cistron did not alter infectivity or in vitro translation. To assess replication and movement phenotypes, P3 mutations were placed in context with a GUS reporter gene. GUS activity measured in barley protoplasts 36 h post-transfection indicated that mutants with synonymous substitutions in P3 retained the ability to replicate at 22-80 % of wild-type levels. Almost no GUS activity was detected in protoplasts transfected with a P3 frame-shift mutant. Histochemical GUS assays conducted 3 days post-inoculation (p.i.) revealed genomes with multiple synonymous substitutions in P3, which were able to establish infection foci limited to small clusters of cells that increased in size only slightly by 5 days p.i. Infection foci produced by wild-type Wheat streak mosaic virus-expressing GUS were much larger at 3 days p.i. and had coalesced by 5 days p.i. No GUS activity was detected in plants inoculated with the frame-shift mutant bearing GUS. Three of four mutants, each with a single synonymous substitution in the 3'-proximal half of the P3 cistron, were wild-type with respect to systemic infectivity. A model RNA secondary structure obtained for the region was disrupted by the debilitating single mutation but not by the other three single mutations. Collectively, these results identify an internal RNA sequence element in the P3 cistron that affects both replication and movement of the viral genome."

"15066789","abstracttext","The performance of Pseudomonas biocontrol agents may be improved by applying mixtures of strains which are complementary in their capacity to suppress plant diseases. Here, we have chosen the combination of Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 with another well-characterized biocontrol agent, P. fluorescens Q2-87, as a model to study how these strains affect each other's expression of a biocontrol trait. In both strains, production of the antimicrobial compound 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) is a crucial factor contributing to the suppression of root diseases. DAPG acts as a signaling compound inducing the expression of its own biosynthetic genes. Experimental setups were developed to investigate whether, when combining strains CHA0 and Q2-87, DAPG excreted by one strain may influence expression of DAPG-biosynthetic genes in the other strain in vitro and on the roots of wheat. DAPG production was monitored by observing the expression of lacZ fused to the biosynthetic gene phlA of the respective strain. Dual-culture assays in which the two strains were grown in liquid medium physically separated by a membrane revealed that Q2-87 but not its DAPG-negative mutant Q2-87::Tn5-1 strongly induced phlA expression in a DeltaphlA mutant of strain CHA0. In the same way, phlA expression in a Q2-87 background was induced by DAPG produced by CHA0. When coinoculated onto the roots of wheat seedlings grown under gnotobiotic conditions, strains Q2-87 and CHA0, but not their respective DAPG-negative mutants, were able to enhance phlA expression in each other. In summary, we have established that two nonrelated pseudomonads may stimulate each other in the expression of an antimicrobial compound important for biocontrol. This interpopulation communication occurs in the rhizosphere, i.e., at the site of pathogen inhibition, and is mediated by the antimicrobial compound itself acting as a signal exchanged between the two pseudomonads."

"15051833","abstracttext","Himalaya 292 (Hordeum vulgare, var. himalaya 292) is a novel, hull-less barley cultivar with a single nucleotide change in the gene encoding starch synthase IIa (EC 2.4.1.21). This leads to loss of enzyme activity, resulting in a grain with less total starch and a higher proportion of amylose. These changes, plus higher total and soluble nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), could increase its resistant starch (RS) content. Accordingly, rats were fed a diet containing stabilized whole-grain barley flours from Himalaya 292 or two commercial varieties (Namoi or Waxiro) or wheat or oat bran at equivalent NSP concentrations for 14 d. There were favorable significant changes in a number of bowel health-related indices. Fecal output by rats fed Himalaya 292 was higher than by those fed Namoi or oat bran, whereas total large bowel digesta mass was higher than in those fed WAXIRO: Cecal starch concentrations and pools were higher in rats fed Himalaya 292 than in all other groups. Fecal and cecal digesta pH was lower in rats fed Himalaya 292 than in all other groups except that fed oat bran. Colonic digesta pH was lower in rats fed Himalaya 292 than in those fed wheat bran or NAMOI: Fecal total SCFA excretion was higher in rats fed Himalaya 292 than in those fed Namoi or oat bran. Although cecal total SCFA pools did not differ among groups, colonic SCFA were higher in rats fed Himalaya 292 than in those fed Namoi or WAXIRO: These data indicate that changes in Himalaya 292 grain composition result in greater RS with consequent alterations in large bowel SCFA and pH when fed to rats."

"16329858","abstracttext","Little is known about factors that affect the indigenous populations of rhizobia in soils. We compared the abundance, diversity and genetic structure of Rhizobium leguminosarum biovar viciae populations in soils under different crop managements, i.e., wheat and maize monocultures, crop rotation, and permanent grassland. Rhizobial populations were sampled from nodules of pea- or vetch plants grown in soils collected at three geographically distant sites in France, each site comprising a plot under long-term maize monoculture. Molecular characterization of isolates was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16S-23S rDNA intergenic spacer as a neutral marker of the genomic background, and PCR-restriction fragment length 0polymorphism of a nodulation gene region, nodD, as a marker of the symbiotic function. The diversity, estimated by richness in types and Simpson's index, was consistently and remarkably lower in soils under maize monoculture than under the other soil managements at the three sites, except for the permanent grassland. The highest level of diversity was found under wheat monoculture. Nucleotide sequences of the main rDNA intergenic spacer types were determined and sequence analysis showed that the prevalent genotypes in the three maize fields were closely related. These results suggest that long-term maize monoculturing decreased the diversity of R. leguminosarum biovar viciae populations and favored a specific subgroup of genotypes, but the size of these populations was generally preserved. We also observed a shift in the distribution of the symbiotic genotypes within the populations under maize monoculture, but the diversity of the symbiotic genotypes was less affected than that of IGS types. The possible effect of such changes on biological nitrogen fixation remains unknown and this requires further investigation."
"16348720","articletitle","Genetic and Phenotypic Diversity of Bacillus polymyxa in Soil and in the Wheat Rhizosphere."
"16348720","abstracttext","Diversity among 130 strains of Bacillus polymyxa was studied; the bacteria were isolated by immunotrapping from nonrhizosphere soil (32 strains), rhizosphere soil (38 strains), and the rhizoplane (60 strains) of wheat plantlets growing in a growth chamber. The strains were characterized phenotypically by 63 auxanographic (API 50 CHB and API 20B strips) and morphological features, serologically by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and genetically by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) profiles of total DNA in combination with hybridization patterns obtained with an rRNA gene probe. Cluster analysis of phenotypic characters by the unweighted pair group method with averages indicated four groups at a similarity level of 93%. Clustering of B. polymyxa strains from the various fractions showed that the strains isolated from nonrhizosphere soil fell into two groups (I and II), while the third group (III) mainly comprised strains isolated from rhizosphere soil. The last group (IV) included strains isolated exclusively from the rhizoplane. Strains belonging to a particular group exhibited a similarity level of 96%. Serological properties revealed a higher variability among strains isolated from nonrhizosphere and rhizosphere soil than among rhizoplane strains. RFLP patterns also revealed a greater genetic diversity among strains isolated from nonrhizosphere and rhizosphere soil and therefore could not be clearly grouped. The RFLP patterns of sorbitol-positive strains isolated from the rhizoplane were identical. These results indicate that diversity within populations of B. polymyxa isolated from nonrhizosphere and rhizosphere soil is higher than that of B. polymyxa isolated from the rhizoplane. It therefore appears that wheat roots may select a specific subpopulation from the soil B. polymyxa population."
"16514165","articletitle","The role of dsbA in colonization of the wheat rhizosphere by Pseudomonas fluorescens Q8r1-96."
"16514165","abstracttext","Certain well-conserved genes in fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. are involved in pathogenic interactions between the bacteria and evolutionarily diverse hosts including plants, insects and vertebrate animals. One such gene, dsbA, encodes a periplasmic disulfide-bond-forming enzyme implicated in the biogenesis of exported proteins and cell surface structures. This study focused on the role of dsbA in Pseudomonas fluorescens Q8r1-96, a biological control strain that produces the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG) and is known for its exceptional ability to colonize the roots of wheat and pea. The deduced DsbA protein from Q8r1-96 is similar to other predicted thiol : disulfide interchange proteins and contains a conserved DsbA catalytic site, a pattern associated with the thioredoxin family active site, and a signal peptide and cleavage site. A dsbA mutant of Q8r1-96 exhibited decreased motility and fluorescence, and altered colony morphology; however, it produced more 2,4-DAPG and total phloroglucinol-related compounds and was more inhibitory in vitro to the fungal root pathogen Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici than was the parental strain. When introduced separately into a natural soil, Q8r1-96 and the dsbA mutant did not differ in their ability to colonize the rhizosphere of wheat in greenhouse experiments lasting 12 weeks. However, when the two strains were co-inoculated, the parental strain consistently out-competed the dsbA mutant. It was concluded that dsbA does not contribute to the exceptional rhizosphere competence of Q8r1-96, although the dsbA mutation reduces competitiveness when the mutant competes with the parental strain in the same niche in the rhizosphere. The results also suggest that exoenzymes and multimeric cell surface structures are unlikely to have a critical role in root colonization by this strain."

"19243908","abstracttext","Thirty samples of Italian durum wheat semolina and whole durum wheat semolina, generally used for the production of Southern Italy's traditional breads, were subjected to microbiological analysis in order to explore their lactic acid bacteria (LAB) diversity and to find strains with antifungal activity. A total of 125 presumptive LAB isolates (Gram-positive and catalase-negative) were characterized by repetitive extragenic palindromic-PCR (REP-PCR) and sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA gene, leading to the identification of the following species: Weissella confusa, Weissella cibaria, Leuconostoc citreum, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus rossiae and Lactobacillus plantarum. The REP-PCR results delineated 17 different patterns whose cluster analysis clearly differentiated W. cibaria from W. confusa isolates. Seventeen strains, each characterized by a different REP-PCR pattern, were screened for their antifungal properties. They were grown in a flour-based medium, comparable to a real food system, and the resulting fermentation products (FPs) were tested against fungal species generally contaminating bakery products, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium roqueforti and Endomyces fibuliger. The results of the study indicated a strong inhibitory activity - comparable to that obtained with the common preservative calcium propionate (0.3% w/v) - of ten LAB strains against the most widespread contaminant of bakery products, P. roqueforti. The screening also highlighted the unexplored antifungal activity of L. citreum, L. rossiae and W. cibaria (1 strain), which inhibited all fungal strains to the same or a higher extent compared with calcium propionate. The fermentation products of these three strains were characterized by low pH values, and a high content of lactic and acetic acids."
"19020664","articletitle","A constructed alkaline consortium and its dynamics in treating alkaline black liquor with very high pollution load."
"19020664","abstracttext_background","Paper pulp wastewater resulting from alkaline extraction of wheat straw, known as black liquor, is very difficult to be treated and causes serious environmental problems due to its high pH value and chemical oxygen demand (COD) pollution load. Lignin, semicellulose and cellulose are the main contributors to the high COD values in black liquor. Very few microorganisms can survive in such harsh environments of the alkaline wheat straw black liquor. A naturally developed microbial community was found accidentally in a black liquor storing pool in a paper pulp mill of China. The community was effective in pH decreasing, color and COD removing from the high alkaline and high COD black liquor."
"19020664","abstracttext_findings","Thirty-eight strains of bacteria were isolated from the black liquor storing pool, and were grouped as eleven operational taxonomy units (OTUs) using random amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR profiles (RAPD). Eleven representative strains of each OTU, which were identified as genera of Halomonas and Bacillus, were used to construct a consortium to treat black liquor with a high pH value of 11.0 and very high COD pollution load of 142,600 mg l(-1). After treatment by the constructed consortium, about 35.4% of color and 39,000 mg l(-1) (27.3%) COD(cr) were removed and the pH decreased to 7.8. 16S rRNA gene polymerase chain reaction denaturant gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) analysis suggested a two-stage treatment mechanism to elucidate the interspecies collaboration: Halomonas isolates were important in the first stage to produce organic acids that contributed to the pH decline, while Bacillus isolates were involved in the degradation of lignin derivatives in the second stage under lower pH conditions."
"19020664","abstracttext_conclusions/significance","Tolerance to the high alkaline environment and good controllability of the simple consortium suggested that the constructed consortium has good potential for black liquor treatment. Facilitating the treatment process by the constructed consortium would provide a promising opportunity to reduce the pollution, as well as to save forest resources and add value to a waste product."
"17301499","articletitle","Influence of jasmonic acid as potential activator of induced resistance against Karnal bunt in developing spikes of wheat."
"17301499","abstracttext","Induction of defense response against Karnal bunt (KB)by suppressing the pathogenesis was observed upon exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA)as evident from decrease in the coefficient of infection and overall response value in both susceptible and resistant varieties of wheat. The ultra-structural changes during disease progression showed the signs of programmed cell death (PCD). However, JA strengthened the defense barrier by enhancing the lignifications of cell walls as observed in spikes of both varieties by histochemical analysis. Compared to the plants inoculated with pathogen alone, plants of resistant line (RJP) first treated with JA followed by inoculation with pathogen showed more lignifications and extracellular deposition of other metabolites on cells, which is supposed to prevent mycelial invasions. Contrary to this, susceptible (SJP)lines also showed lignifications but the invasion was more compared to resistant line. Induction of protease activity was higher in resistant variety than its corresponding susceptible variety. The protease activity induced during the colonization of the pathogen and its proliferation inside the host system gets inhibited by JA treatment as demonstrated by the quantitative and in-gel protease assay. The results indicate the role of JA signalling in inhibiting the proteases due to expression of certain protease inhibitor genes. SDS-PAGE analysis shows differential gene expression through induction and/or suppression of different proteins in wheat spikes of resistant and susceptible varieties under the influence of JA. Thus, exogenously applied JA provides the conditioning effect prior to the challenge of infection and induces defense against KB probably by maintaining a critical balance between proteases and protease inhibitors and/or coordinating induction of different families of new proteins."

"17070830","abstracttext","We report on the transcriptional patterns of three antibacterial genes, a defensin (MdesDEF-1), a diptericin (MdesDIP-1) and a lysozyme (MdesLYS-1), during development in Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor. Quantitative analysis by real-time PCR of mRNA levels in different tissues revealed a predominance of the transcripts for all three genes in the midgut, while analysis during development revealed greatest abundance in mRNA during the 3rd-instar. An evaluation of the midgut lumen revealed the presence of a diverse bacterial flora in larvae maintained on susceptible wheat. Further, the titer of bacteria in the midgut increased approximately 250-fold from the 1st-instar through the 2nd-instar. However, no detectable titer of bacteria was observed from the midgut lumen of larvae maintained on resistant plants. PCR amplicons produced using primers designed to conserved regions of the Pseudomonas 16S rRNA gene supported taxonomic identification for some of the bacteria comprising the midgut flora as belonging to the genus Pseudomonas. Analysis of mRNA for the Hessian fly antibacterial genes in larvae feeding on susceptible and resistant plants revealed an increase in the transcript level for MdesDEF-1 in 1st-instar larvae on susceptible plants, while the transcript levels for MdesDIP-1 and MdesLYS-1 were constant. Results suggest the transcriptional patterns of the Hessian fly antibacterial genes observed could be associated with the developing midgut bacterial flora present in larvae feeding on susceptible wheat as well as microbial challenge encountered at other stages in development."

Synapsis is complete at pachytene following the formation of a tri-partite proteinaceous structure known as the synaptonemal complex (SC). In yeast, HOP1 is essential for formation of the SC, and localises along chromosome axes during prophase I. Homologues in Arabidopsis (AtASY1), Brassica (BoASY1) and rice (OsPAIR2) have been isolated through analysis of mutants that display decreased fertility due to severely reduced synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Analysis of these genes has indicated that they play a similar role to HOP1 in pairing and formation of the SC through localisation to axial/lateral elements of the SC."

Forty-six Polish cultivars of both winter and spring triticale were analysed with 7 PCR-based markers. Amplified DNA fragments of HMW glutenin Glu-1 genes were separated by agarose slab-gel electrophoresis. Differences between all 3 alleles at the locus Glu-A1 [Glu-A1a (encoding Ax1), 1b (Ax2*), and 1c (AxNull)], 4 alleles at Glu-B1-1 [Glu-B1-1a (Bx7), 1b (Bx7*), 1d (Bx6), 1ac (Bx6.8)], and 5 alleles at Glu-B1-2 [Glu-B1-2a (By8), 2b (By9), 2o (By8*), 2s (By18*), and 2z (By20*)] were revealed. In total, 16 allele combinations were observed. Molecular markers are particularly helpful in distinguishing the wheat Glu-A1a and Glu-A1b alleles from the rye Glu-R1a and Glu-R1b alleles in triticale genotypes, respectively, as well as subunits Bx7 from Bx7* and By8 from By8*, which could not be distinguished by SDS-PAGE. Novel glutenin subunits By18* and By20* (unique to triticale) were identified. HMW glutenin subunit combinations of Polish triticale cultivars, earlier identified by SDS-PAGE analyses, were verified by PCR-based DNA markers. Rapid identification of wheat Glu-1 alleles by molecular markers can be an efficient alternative to the standard separation procedure for early selection of useful triticale genotypes with good bread-making quality."

"18613599","abstracttext","The reproductive rates of Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), Biotype 1 (RWA 1) and Biotype 2 (RWA 2) were compared in the laboratory at three temperature regimes on a Russian wheat aphid resistant cultivar ('Prairie Red') and a susceptible cultivar ('TAM 107'). The objective of this study was to expose RWA 1 and RWA 2 to three temperature regimes and two levels of resistance to find whether there were reproductive differences that may occur within each biotype as well as differences in reproduction between biotypes. In addition, temperature effects of the Dn4 gene on biotype reproduction were noted. Differences in reproductive rates between the two biotypes seem to be driven by temperature. For both biotypes, longevity and reproductive rate parameters, except for intrinsic rate of increase, were lower at the 24-29 degree C temperature regime than the 13-18 degree C and 18-24 degree C temperature regimes. The intrinsic rate of increase was higher for both biotypes at the 18-24 degree C and 24-29 degree C temperature regimes than at the 13-18 degree C temperature regime. Reproductive rates between biotypes were similar at the two higher temperature regimes, but the fecundity for RWA 1 was less than RWA 2 at the 13-18 degree C temperature. The change in fecundity rates between RWA 1 and RWA 2 at lower temperatures could have ecological and geographical implications for RWA 2."

"20035314","abstracttext","Crown rot (CR), caused by various Fusarium species, is a chronic wheat disease in Australia. As part of our objective of improving the efficiency of breeding CR resistant wheat varieties, we have been searching for novel sources of resistance. This paper reports on the genetic control of one of these newly identified resistant genotypes, 'CSCR6'. A population derived from a cross between CSCR6 and an Australian variety 'Lang' was analyzed using two Fusarium isolates belonging to two different species, one Fusarium pseudograminearum and the other Fusarium graminearum. The two isolates detected QTL with the same chromosomal locations and comparable magnitudes, indicating that CR resistance is not species-specific. The resistant allele of one of the QTL was derived from 'CSCR6'. This QTL, designated as Qcrs.cpi-3B, was located on the long arm of chromosome 3B and explains up to 48.8% of the phenotypic variance based on interval mapping analysis. Another QTL, with resistant allele from the variety 'Lang', was located on chromosome 4B. This QTL explained up to 22.8% of the phenotypic variance. A strong interaction between Qcsr.cpi-3B and Qcsr.cpi-4B was detected, reducing the maximum effect of Qcrs.cpi-3B to 43.1%. The effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were further validated in four additional populations and the presence of this single QTL reduced CR severity by up to 42.1%. The fact that significant effects of Qcrs.cpi-3B were detected across all trials with different genetic backgrounds and with the use of isolates belonging to two different Fusarium species make it an ideal target for breeding programs as well as for further characterization of the gene(s) involved in its resistance."

"20229216","abstracttext","Damage by the Russian wheat aphid (RWA), Diuraphis noxia, significantly reduces wheat and barley yields worldwide. In compatible interactions, virulent RWA populations flourish and susceptible plants suffer extensive leaf chlorophyll loss. In incompatible interactions, RWA reproduction and population growth are significantly reduced and RWA-related chlorophyll loss in resistant plants is minor. The objectives of this study were to develop an understanding of the molecular and phytochemical bases of RWA resistance in plants containing the Dnx resistance gene. Microarray, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and phytohormone assays were conducted to identify transcriptome components unique to RWA-infested Dnx plants and susceptible (Dn0) plants, and to identify and characterize putative genes involved in Dnx plant defense responses. We found that RWA-infested Dnx plants upregulated >180 genes related to reactive oxygen species, signaling, pathogen defense, and arthropod allelochemical and physical defense. The expression of several of these genes in RWA-infested Dnx plants increased significantly from 6- to 24-h post infestation (hpi), but their expression in Dn0 plants, when present, was delayed until 48- to 96 hpi. Concentrations of 16- and 18-carbon fatty acids, trans-methyl-12-oxophytodienoic acid, and abscisic acid were significantly greater in Dnx foliage than in Dn0 foliage after RWA infestation, suggesting that Dnx RWA defense and resistance genes may be regulated via the oxylipin pathway. These findings provide a foundation for the elucidation of the molecular basis for compatible- and incompatible plant-aphid interactions."

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that five wheat NF-YC members (TaNF-YC5, 8, 9, 11 and 12) were upregulated by light in both the leaf and seedling shoot. Co-expression analysis of Affymetrix wheat genome array datasets revealed that transcript levels of a large number of genes were consistently correlated with those of the TaNF-YC11 and TaNF-YC8 genes in three to four separate Affymetrix array datasets. TaNF-YC11-correlated transcripts were significantly enriched with the Gene Ontology term photosynthesis. Sequence analysis in the promoters of TaNF-YC11-correlated genes revealed the presence of putative NF-Y complex binding sites (CCAAT motifs). Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of a subset of potential TaNF-YC11 target genes showed that ten out of the 13 genes were also light-upregulated in both the leaf and seedling shoot and had significantly correlated expression profiles with TaNF-YC11. The potential target genes for TaNF-YC11 include subunit members from all four thylakoid membrane-bound complexes required for the conversion of solar energy into chemical energy and rate-limiting enzymes in the Calvin cycle. These data indicate that TaNF-YC11 is potentially involved in regulation of photosynthesis-related genes."

Among 1250 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer pairs in the whole genome, a total of 21 markers, obtained by recessive class approach, along with other ten tightly linked markers on reference maps in wheat, were used to survey 243 F2 individuals. As a result, 28 markers were mapped into five genetic linkage groups. The performance for female sterility for each F2 individual was evaluated simultaneously at the Urumqi and Huai'an experimental stations in 2006-2007. The two phenotypic datasets along with marker information were jointly analysed in the detection of QTL using penalized maximum likelihood approach. A total of six QTLs, including two main-effect QTLs, three epistatic QTLs and one environmental interaction and accounting for 0.67-24.55% of the total phenotypic variance, were identified. All estimated effects accounted for 53.26% of the total phenotypic variation. The taf1 detected in previous study was also located on the same marker interval on chromosome 2DS. These results enrich our understanding of the genetic basis of the female sterility."
"20565994","articletitle","New hypotheses for the health-protective mechanisms of whole-grain cereals: what is beyond fibre?"
"20565994","abstracttext","Epidemiological studies have clearly shown that whole-grain cereals can protect against obesity, diabetes, CVD and cancers. The specific effects of food structure (increased satiety, reduced transit time and glycaemic response), fibre (improved faecal bulking and satiety, viscosity and SCFA production, and/or reduced glycaemic response) and Mg (better glycaemic homeostasis through increased insulin secretion), together with the antioxidant and anti-carcinogenic properties of numerous bioactive compounds, especially those in the bran and germ (minerals, trace elements, vitamins, carotenoids, polyphenols and alkylresorcinols), are today well-recognised mechanisms in this protection. Recent findings, the exhaustive listing of bioactive compounds found in whole-grain wheat, their content in whole-grain, bran and germ fractions and their estimated bioavailability, have led to new hypotheses. The involvement of polyphenols in cell signalling and gene regulation, and of sulfur compounds, lignin and phytic acid should be considered in antioxidant protection. Whole-grain wheat is also a rich source of methyl donors and lipotropes (methionine, betaine, choline, inositol and folates) that may be involved in cardiovascular and/or hepatic protection, lipid metabolism and DNA methylation. Potential protective effects of bound phenolic acids within the colon, of the B-complex vitamins on the nervous system and mental health, of oligosaccharides as prebiotics, of compounds associated with skeleton health, and of other compounds such as alpha-linolenic acid, policosanol, melatonin, phytosterols and para-aminobenzoic acid also deserve to be studied in more depth. Finally, benefits of nutrigenomics to study complex physiological effects of the 'whole-grain package', and the most promising ways for improving the nutritional quality of cereal products are discussed."

"19703719","abstracttext","Tarhana is a traditional fermented product produced from a mixture of spontaneously fermented yogurt and wheat flour in Turkey. The aims of the present study were to enumerate and identify for the first time by molecular biology-based methods predominant lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated during processing of Tarhana. Samples were collected from eight different regions of Turkey. In order to explore the relationship between raw material and the microbiology of Tarhana, yogurt and wheat flour were also analyzed. A total of 226 Gram-positive and catalase-negative isolates were obtained from MRS, M17 and SBM (Slanetz and Bartley Medium). The isolates were grouped and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including rep-PCR fingerprinting [(GTG)(5) primer], multiplex PCR, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and carbohydrate assimilation profiling. Pediococcus acidilactici were found to constitute 27% of the isolates, 19% were identified as Streptococcus thermophilus, 19% as Lactobacillus fermentum, 12% as Enterococcus faecium, 7% as Pediococcus pentosaceus, 5% as Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, 4% as Weissella cibaria, 2% as Lactobacillus plantarum, 2% as Lactobacillus delbrueckii spp. bulgaricus, 2% as Leuconostoc citreum, 1% as Lactobacillus paraplantarum and 0.5% as Lactobacillus casei. The different production sites investigated all had individual LAB profiles, but with P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus being isolated from the majority of samples. The main source of P. acidilactici and S. thermophilus was found to be the yogurt."

"19887112","abstracttext","Pathogenic micro-organisms have been suggested to vary the number of intragenic repeats present within secreted or cell membrane/cell wall-associated proteins in order to manipulate host immune responses. We have identified a number of genes predicted to encode secreted proteins possessing internal tandem repeats in the genome sequence of Mycosphaerella graminicola (isolate IPO323), a wheat leaf-specific fungal pathogen and causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch disease. Twenty-three M. graminicolaTandem Repeat Proteins (MgTRPs) were subject to further analysis. Many MgTRPs varied in the number of intragenic repeats between isolates and almost all were expressed. Peak gene expression was frequently observed towards the end of the symptomless phase of wheat leaf colonisation which typically lasts for 8-10 days after inoculation. In contrast, with one exception, increased expression of the majority of MgTRPs was not detected during interactions with resistant host genotypes. Repeat number differences detected in genomic DNA were retained in different transcript sizes produced during plant infection by different isolates. One in planta expressed MgTRP was found to reside within a approximately 6 kb region that appears to be absent from a number of tested isolates and also from individual members of a modern field population. Sequence analysis of another in planta expressed MgTRP from six isolates highlighted the potential for structural changes which may occur as a consequence of varying internal repeat numbers and provided support for repeat variation occurring as a consequence of intragenic recombination. These data provide new insights into the genetic variation which exists within M. graminicola populations at the level of in planta expressed secreted/surface-associated proteins which are candidate effectors in the host-pathogen interaction."
"19880540","articletitle","Effects of beta-1,3-glucan from Septoria tritici on structural defence responses in wheat."
"19880540","abstracttext","The accumulation of the pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase and structural defence responses were studied in leaves of wheat either resistant or susceptible to the hemibiotrophic pathogen Septoria tritici. Resistance was associated with an early accumulation of beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase transcripts followed by a subsequent reduction in level. Resistance was also associated with high activity of beta-1,3-glucanase, especially in the apoplastic fluid, in accordance with the biotrophic/endophytic lifestyle of the pathogen in the apoplastic spaces, thus showing the highly localized accumulation of defence proteins in the vicinity of the pathogen. Isoform analysis of beta-1,3-glucanase from the apoplastic fluid revealed that resistance was associated with the accumulation of an endo-beta-1,3-glucanase, previously implicated in defence against pathogens, and a protein with identity to ADPG pyrophosphatase (92%) and germin-like proteins (93%), which may be involved in cell wall reinforcement. In accordance with this, glycoproteins like extensin were released into the apoplast and callose accumulated to a greater extent in cell walls, whereas lignin and polyphenolics were not found to correlate with defence. Treatment of a susceptible wheat cultivar with purified beta-1,3-glucan fragments from cell walls of S. tritici gave complete protection against disease and this was accompanied by increased gene expression of beta-1,3-glucanase and the deposition of callose. Collectively, these data indicate that resistance is dependent on a fast, initial recognition of the pathogen, probably due to beta-1,3-glucan in the fungal cell walls, and this results in the accumulation of beta-1,3-glucanase and structural defence responses, which may directly inhibit the pathogen and protect the host against fungal enzymes and toxins."
"21554456","articletitle","Wheat flowering repressor VRN2 and promoter CO2 compete for interactions with NUCLEAR FACTOR-Y complexes."
"21554456","abstracttext","The transition from vegetative to reproductive development in the temperate cereals is mainly regulated by seasonal cues including vernalization (determined mainly by VRN1 and VRN2 genes) and photoperiod (determined mainly by PPD1 and CO2 genes). The wheat VRN3 gene, which is similar to Arabidopsis FT, plays a central role in the integration of the competing signals from these two pathways. Under long days, VRN3 transcription is down-regulated by VRN2, a unique flowering repressor in cereals, and up-regulated by CO2. Overexpression of VRN3 overcomes VRN2 repression and promotes VRN1 transcription and flowering initiation. Using yeast two- and three-hybrid assays we show here that the CCT domains present in VRN2 and CO2 proteins interact with the same subset of eight NF-Y proteins, and that these CCT proteins compete with NF-YA for interactions with NF-YB proteins. We have confirmed all these interactions in vitro, and the interactions between VRN2 and two of the three NF-YB proteins were further confirmed in planta. In addition, we show that mutations in the CCT domain of VRN2 that eliminate the vernalization requirement in winter wheat also reduce the strength of the interactions between VRN2 and NF-Y proteins, and the ability of VRN2 to compete with CO2. Taken together, our results suggest that the interactions between CCT and NF-Y proteins play an important role in the integration of the vernalization and photoperiod seasonal signals, and provide a flexible combinatorial system to integrate multiple developmental and environmental signals in the regulation of flowering initiation in the temperate cereals."

"21615298","abstracttext","Wheat end product quality is determined by a complex group of traits including dough viscoelastic characteristics and bread-making properties. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping and analysis were conducted for endosperm texture, dough-mixing strength, and bread-making properties in a population of 139 (MN99394 × MN98550) recombinant inbred lines that were evaluated at three environments in 2006. Based on the genetic map of 534 loci, six QTL were identified for endosperm texture, with the main QTL on chromosomes 1A (R(2) = 6.6%-17.3%), 5A (R(2) = 6.1%-17.1%), and 5D (R(2) = 15.8%-22%). Thirty-four QTL were identified for eight dough-mixing strength and bread-making properties. Major QTL clusters were associated with the low-molecular weight glutenin gene Glu-A3, the two high-molecular weight glutenin genes Glu-B1 and Glu-D1, and two regions on chromosome 6D. Alleles at these QTL clusters have previously been proven useful for wheat quality, except one of the QTL clusters on chromosome 6D. A QTL cluster on chromosome 6D is one of the novel chromosome regions influencing dough-mixing strength and bread-making properties. The QTL for endosperm texture on chromosomes 1A, 5A, and 5B also influenced flour ash content (12.4%-23.3%), flour protein content (10.5%-12.5%), and flour colour (7.7%-13.5%), respectively."
"21994252","articletitle","The making of a new pathogen: insights from comparative population genomics of the domesticated wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola and its wild sister species."
"21994252","abstracttext","The fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola emerged as a new pathogen of cultivated wheat during its domestication ~11,000 yr ago. We assembled 12 high-quality full genome sequences to investigate the genetic footprints of selection in this wheat pathogen and closely related sister species that infect wild grasses. We demonstrate a strong effect of natural selection in shaping the pathogen genomes with only ~3% of nonsynonymous mutations being effectively neutral. Forty percent of all fixed nonsynonymous substitutions, on the other hand, are driven by positive selection. Adaptive evolution has affected M. graminicola to the highest extent, consistent with recent host specialization. Positive selection has prominently altered genes encoding secreted proteins and putative pathogen effectors supporting the premise that molecular host-pathogen interaction is a strong driver of pathogen evolution. Recent divergence between pathogen sister species is attested by the high degree of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) in their genomes. We exploit ILS to generate a genetic map of the species without any crossing data, document recent times of species divergence relative to genome divergence, and show that gene-rich regions or regions with low recombination experience stronger effects of natural selection on neutral diversity. Emergence of a new agricultural host selected a highly specialized and fast-evolving pathogen with unique evolutionary patterns compared with its wild relatives. The strong impact of natural selection, we document, is at odds with the small effective population sizes estimated and suggest that population sizes were historically large but likely unstable."

"23446108","abstracttext","This study was designed to evaluate the effects of algal and yeast β-glucans on the porcine gastrointestinal microbiota, specifically the community of Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and coliforms. A total of 48 pigs were fed four diets over a 28-day period to determine the effect that each had on these communities. The control diet consisted of wheat and soya bean meal. The remaining three diets contained wheat and soya bean meal supplemented with β-glucan at 250 g/tonne from Laminaria digitata, Laminaria hyperborea or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Faecal samples were collected from animals before feeding each diet and after the feeding period. The animals were slaughtered the following day and samples were collected from the stomach, ileum, caecum, proximal colon and distal colon. Alterations in Lactobacillus in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) were analysed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles generated by group-specific 16S rRNA gene PCR amplicons. Plate count analysis was also performed to quantify total coliforms. DGGE profiles indicated that all β-glucan diets provoked the emergence of a richer community of Lactobacillus. The richest community of lactobacilli emerged after feeding L. digitata (LD β-glucan). Plate count analysis revealed that the L. hyperborea (LH β-glucan) diet had a statistically significant effect on the coliform counts in the proximal colon in comparison with the control diet. β-glucan from L. digitata and S. cerevisiae also generally reduced coliforms but to a lesser extent. Nevertheless, the β-glucan diets did not significantly reduce levels of Lactobacillus or Bifidobacterium. DGGE analysis of GIT samples indicated that the three β-glucan diets generally promoted the establishment of a more varied range of Lactobacillus species in the caecum, proximal and distal colon. The LH β-glucan had the most profound reducing effect on coliform counts when compared with the control diet and diets supplemented with L. digitata and S. cerevisiae β-glucans."

"23451228","abstracttext","Fusarium culmorum is one of the most harmful pathogens of durum wheat and is the causal agent of foot and root rot (FRR) disease. F. culmorum produces the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) that is involved in the pathogenic process. The role of the gene FcStuA, a StuA ortholog protein with an APSES domain sharing 98.5% homology to the FgStuA protein (FGSG10129), was determined by functional characterisation of deletion mutants obtained from two F. culmorum wild-type strains, FcUk99 (a highly pathogenic DON producer) and Fc233B (unable to produce toxin and with a mild pathogenic behavior). The ΔFcStuA mutants originating from both strains showed common phenotypic characters including stunted vegetative growth, loss of hydrophobicity of the mycelium, altered pigmentation, decreased activity of polygalacturonic enzymes and catalases, altered and reduced conidiation, delayed conidial germination patterns and complete loss of pathogenicity towards wheat stem base/root tissue. Glycolytic process efficiency [measured as growth on glucose as sole carbon (C) source] was strongly impaired and growth was partially restored on glutamic acid. Growth on pectin-like sources ranked in between glucose and glutamic acid with the following order (the lowest to the highest growth): beechwood xylan, sugarbeet arabinan, polygalacturonic acid, citrus pectin, apple pectin, potato azogalactan. DON production in the mutants originating from FcUK99 strain was significantly decreased (-95%) in vitro. Moreover, both sets of mutants were unable to colonise non-cereal plant tissues, i.e. apple and tomato fruits and potato tubers. No differences between mutants, ectopic and wild-type strains were observed concerning the level of resistance towards four fungicides belonging to three classes, the demethylase inhibitors epoxiconazole and tebuconzole, the succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor isopyrazam and the cytochrome bc1 inhibitor trifloxystrobin. StuA, given its multiple functions in cell regulation and pathogenicity control, is proposed as a potential target for novel disease management strategies."

"23451238","abstracttext","A total of 358 recent European winter wheat varieties plus 14 spring wheat varieties were evaluated for resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum in four separate environments. The FHB scores based on FHB incidence (Type I resistance)×FHB severity (Type II resistance) indicated a wide phenotypic variation of the varieties with BLUE (best linear unbiased estimation) values ranging from 0.07 to 33.67. Genotyping with 732 microsatellite markers resulted in 782 loci of which 620 were placed on the ITMI map. The resulting average marker distance of 6.8 cM allowed genome wide association mapping employing a mixed model. Though no clear population structure was discovered, a kinship matrix was used for stratification. A total of 794 significant (-log10(p)-value≥3.0) associations between SSR-loci and environment-specific FHB scores or BLUE values were detected, which included 323 SSR alleles. For FHB incidence and FHB severity a total of 861 and 877 individual marker-trait associations (MTA) were detected, respectively. Associations for both traits co-located with FHB score in most cases. Consistent associations detected in three or more environments were found on all chromosomes except chromosome 6B, and with the highest number of MTA on chromosome 5B. The dependence of the number of favourable and unfavourable alleles within a variety to the respective FHB scores indicated an additive effect of favourable and unfavourable alleles, i.e. genotypes with more favourable or less unfavourable alleles tended to show greater resistance to FHB. Assessment of a marker specific for the dwarfing gene Rht-D1 resulted in strong effects. The results provide a prerequisite for designing genome wide breeding strategies for FHB resistance."
"23581987","articletitle","Interaction of short peptides with FITC-labeled wheat histones and their complexes with deoxyribooligonucleotides."
"23581987","abstracttext","Judging from fluorescence modulation (quenching), short peptides (Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly, Glu-Asp-Arg, Ala-Glu-Asp-Leu, Lys-Glu-Asp-Gly, Ala-Glu-Asp-Arg, and Lys-Glu-Asp-Trp) bind with FITC-labeled wheat histones H1, H2B, H3, and H4. This results from the interaction of the peptides with the N-terminal histone regions that contain respective and seemingly homologous peptide-binding motifs. Because homologous amino acid sequences in wheat core histones were not found, the peptides seem to bind with some core histone regions having specific conformational structure. Peptide binding with histones and histone-deoxyribooligonucleotide complexes depends on the nature of the histone and the primary structures of the peptides and oligonucleotides; thus, it is site specific. Histones H1 bind preferentially with single-stranded oligonucleotides by homologous sites in the C-terminal region of the protein. Unlike histone H1, the core histones bind predominantly with double-stranded methylated oligonucleotides and methylated DNA. Stern-Volmer constants of interaction of histone H1 and core histones with double-stranded hemimethylated oligonucleotides are higher compared with that of binding with unmethylated ones. DNA or deoxyribooligonucleotides in a complex with histones can enhance or inhibit peptide binding. It is suggested that site-specific interactions of short biologically active peptides with histone tails can serve in chromatin as control epigenetic mechanisms of regulation of gene activity and cellular differentiation."

"22554927","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum and the closely related F. culmorum were found to be associated with over foaming of bottled beer (gushing) when contaminated brewing malt is used. The presence of highly surface active hydrophobins produced by these fungi upon growth on wheat or barley in the field or during malting may affect bubble formation and stability in gushing beers and other carbonated beverages. Aiming for a method for the rapid and user friendly analysis of unmalted and malted cereals during quality control in the brewing industry, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for the detection of Fusarium spp. capable of producing the gushing inducing hydrophobin Hyd5p was set up. A set of primers was designed towards a 221 bp region within the hyd5 gene of F. culmorum. The LAMP product was verified by sequencing a 150 bp portion. Testing specificity with purified DNA from 99 different fungal species as well as barley and wheat showed that DNA synthesis only occurred during LAMP when DNA of the closely related species F. graminearum, F. culmorum, F. cerealis and F. lunulosporum were used as template. In-tube indirect detection of DNA amplification was applied using manganese-quenched calcein as fluorescence indicator for pyrophosphate produced during DNA synthesis. The assay had a detection limit of 0.74 pg of purified target DNA which corresponds 20 copy numbers per reaction within 30 minutes using a simple heating block. Analysis of Fusarium infected cereals revealed that the assay was able to detect F. graminearum at a level of 0.5% of infected grains in uninfected barley by analysis of surface washings without further sample preparation. Results show that the hyd5 based LAMP assay can be a rapid, useful and sensitive tool for quality control in the brewing and malting industry."
"22875177","articletitle","A single nucleotide polymorphism at the Vrn-D1 promoter region in common wheat is associated with vernalization response."
"22875177","abstracttext","Facultative wheat varieties adapt to a particular environment. But the molecular basis for the facultative growth habit is not clear relative to winter and spring growth habit. Two sets of wheat varieties were chosen for this study. Set 1 comprised ten spring accessions and Set 2 comprised ten facultative accessions. All accessions had been tested by the previously described allele-specific markers and shown having the same allelic composition of vrn-A1 vrn-B1 Vrn-D1 and vrn-B3. Here we examined whether differences in growth habit might be associated with as yet unidentified sequence variation at Vrn-D1 locus. A region including the intron 1 deletion, the entire reading frame from a cDNA template and a part of promoter region of the dominant Vrn-D1 gene in each of the accessions was sequenced, and a single nucleotide polymorphism was found between facultative accessions and spring accessions in the CArG-box at the promoter region. The novel allele in facultative accessions was designated as Vrn-D1b. The investigation of an F(2) population segregating for Vrn-D1b and Vrn-D1a (previously, Vrn-D1) in the greenhouse under long days without vernalization showed that the plants with Vrn-D1b homozygous allele headed 32 days later and had about three more leaves than the plants with Vrn-D1a homozygous allele. As Vrn-D1b has the same deletion in intron 1 as Vrn-D1a, and, in addition, a single nucleotide mutation at promoter region, and is associated with facultative growth habit, we suggest that the promoter mutation may modify the basal activity level of an allele of VRN1 that is already active (due to the loss of segments in intron 1). Our finding further supports that both the promoter and intron 1 regulatory affect vernalization response and work independently."

"22457395","abstracttext","Resistant starch (RS), fed as high amylose maize starch (HAMS) or butyrylated HAMS (HAMSB), opposes dietary protein-induced colonocyte DNA damage in rats. In this study, rats were fed Western-type diets moderate in fat (19%) and protein (20%) containing digestible starches [low amylose maize starch (LAMS) or low amylose whole wheat (LAW)] or RS [HAMS, HAMSB, or a whole high amylose wheat (HAW) generated by RNA interference] for 11 wk (n = 10/group). A control diet included 7% fat, 13% protein, and LAMS. Colonocyte DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) were significantly higher (by 70%) in rats fed the Western diet containing LAMS relative to controls. Dietary HAW, HAMS, and HAMSB opposed this effect while raising digesta levels of SCFA and lowering ammonia and phenol levels. SSB correlated inversely with total large bowel SCFA, including colonic butyrate concentration (R(2) = 0.40; P = 0.009), and positively with colonic ammonia concentration (R(2) = 0.40; P = 0.014). Analysis of gut microbiota populations using a phylogenetic microarray revealed profiles that fell into 3 distinct groups: control and LAMS; HAMS and HAMSB; and LAW and HAW. The expression of colonic genes associated with the maintenance of genomic integrity (notably Mdm2, Top1, Msh3, Ung, Rere, Cebpa, Gmnn, and Parg) was altered and varied with RS source. HAW is as effective as HAMS and HAMSB in opposing diet-induced colonic DNA damage in rats, but their effects on the large bowel microbiota and colonocyte gene expression differ, possibly due to the presence of other fiber components in HAW."
"22493673","articletitle","The predicted secretome of the plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum: a refined comparative analysis."
"22493673","abstracttext","The fungus Fusarium graminearum forms an intimate association with the host species wheat whilst infecting the floral tissues at anthesis. During the prolonged latent period of infection, extracellular communication between live pathogen and host cells must occur, implying a role for secreted fungal proteins. The wheat cells in contact with fungal hyphae subsequently die and intracellular hyphal colonisation results in the development of visible disease symptoms. Since the original genome annotation analysis was done in 2007, which predicted the secretome using TargetP, the F. graminearum gene call has changed considerably through the combined efforts of the BROAD and MIPS institutes. As a result of the modifications to the genome and the recent findings that suggested a role for secreted proteins in virulence, the F. graminearum secretome was revisited. In the current study, a refined F. graminearum secretome was predicted by combining several bioinformatic approaches. This strategy increased the probability of identifying truly secreted proteins. A secretome of 574 proteins was predicted of which 99% was supported by transcriptional evidence. The function of the annotated and unannotated secreted proteins was explored. The potential role(s) of the annotated proteins including, putative enzymes, phytotoxins and antifungals are discussed. Characterisation of the unannotated proteins included the analysis of Pfam domains and features associated with known fungal effectors, for example, small size, cysteine-rich and containing internal amino acid repeats. A comprehensive comparative genomic analysis involving 57 fungal and oomycete genomes revealed that only a small number of the predicted F. graminearum secreted proteins can be considered to be either species or sequenced strain specific."

"22525075","abstracttext","The red flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum (Herbst), is primarily found associated with human structures such as wheat and rice mills. Such structures are predicted to be spatially isolated resource patches with frequent population bottlenecks that should influence their genetic structure. Genetic diversity and differentiation among nine populations of T. castaneum collected from wheat and rice mills (ranging from <1-5,700 km apart) were investigated using eight polymorphic loci (microsatellites and other insertion-deletion polymorphisms, each with 3-14 alleles). Seventy-two locus-by-population combinations were evaluated, of which 31 deviated significantly from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, all because of a deficiency of heterozygotes. AMOVA analysis indicated significant differences among populations, with 8.3% of the variation in allele frequency resulting from comparisons among populations, and commodity type and geographic region not significant factors. Although there were significant differences in genetic differentiation among populations (F(ST) values = 0.018-0.149), genetic distance was not significantly correlated with geographic distance. Correct assignment to the source population was successful for only 56% of individuals collected. Further analyses confirmed the occurrence of recent genetic bottlenecks in five out of nine populations. These results provide evidence that populations of T. castaneum collected from mills show spatial genetic structure, but the poor ability to assign individuals to source populations and lack of isolation by distance suggest greater levels of gene flow than predicted originally."

"20808526","abstracttext","High-throughput sequencing of eukaryotic genomes has revived interest in the structure and function of repetitive genomic sequences, previously referred to as junk DNA. Repetitive sequences, including transposable elements, are now believed to play a significant role in genomic differentiation and evolution. Some are also expressed as regulatory noncoding RNAs. Vast DNA databases exist for higher eukaryotes; however, with the exception of homologues of known repetitive-sequence-families and transposable elements, most repetitive elements still need to be annotated. Revolver and Superior, both discovered in the Triticeae, are novel classes of transposon-like genes and major components of large cereal genomes. Revolver was isolated from rye via genome subtraction of sequences common to rye and wheat. Superior was isolated from rye by cleavage with EcoO109I, the recognition sites of which consist of a 5'- PuGGNCCPy-3' multi-sequence. Revolver is 2929-3041 bp long with an inverted repeat sequence on each end. The Superior family elements are 1292-1432 bp in length, with divergent 5' regions, indicating the presence of considerable structural diversity. Revolver and Superior are transcriptionally active elements; Revolver harbors a single gene consisting of three exons and two introns, encoding a protein of 139 amino acid residues. Revolver variants range in size from 2665 bp to 4269 bp, with some variants lacking the 5' region, indicating structural diversity around the first exon. Revolver and Superior are dispersed across all seven chromosomes of rye. Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat, and has been amplified or lost in several species during the evolution of the Triticeae. This article reviews the recently discovered Revolver and Superior families of plant transposons, which do not share identity with any known autonomous transposable elements or repetitive elements from any living species."

A relative proteome exploration of the expression patterns indicates that proteins are involved in abiotic and biotic stress. Functional category analysis indicates that these differentially expressed proteins are mainly involved in disease/defense (15.38%, 21.26%, and 16.78%), metabolism (8.39%, 12.07%, and 14.09%), energy metabolism (11.19%, 11.49%, and 13.42%), protein synthesis (9.09%, 9.20%, and 8.72%), cell growth and division (9.09%, 4.60%, and 6.04%), cellular organization (4.20%, 5.75%, and 5.37%), development (6.29%, 2.87%, 3.36%), folding and stability (6.29%, 8.62%, and 8.05%), signal transduction (11.19%, 7.47%, and 8.05%), storage protein (4.20%, 1.72%, and 2.01%), transcription (5.59%, 5.17%, and 4.03%), and transport facilitation (1.40%, 1.15%, and 3.36%) in A, B, and D genomes, respectively. Here, we reported genome-specific protein interaction network using Cytoscape software, which provides further insight into the molecular functions and mechanism of biochemical pathways. We provide a promising understanding about the expressed proteins and protein functions. Our approach should be applicable as a marker to assist in breeding or gene transfer for quality and stress research of cultivated wheat."

"20830464","abstracttext","The leaf rust resistance gene Lr19 and Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL) derived from the wild wheatgrass Lophopyrum ponticum have been located on chromosome 7E. The main objectives of the present study were to develop a genetic map of chromosome 7E and map the two resistance loci using a population of 237 F(7:8) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between two Thatcher-L. ponticum substitution lines, K11463 (7el(1)(7D)) and K2620 (7el(2)(7D)). 532 G-SSR, E-SSR and STS markers from wheat chromosome group 7 were screened in the parent lines. Of these, 118 markers were polymorphic, with a polymorphism frequency of 22.2%. A genetic map of L. ponticum chromosome 7E was constructed with 64 markers, covering 95.76 cM, with an average genetic distance of 1.47 cM between markers. The major FHB resistance locus, temporarily assigned as FhbLoP, was mapped to the very distal region of the long arm of chromosome 7E within a 3.71 cM interval flanked by Xcfa2240 and Xswes19, which accounts for 30.46% of the phenotypic variance. Lr19 was bracketed by Xwmc273 and XBE404744, with a map distance of 1.54 and 1.43 cM from either side, respectively. The closely linked markers identified in this study will be helpful for marker-assisted introgression of the L. ponticum-derived FhbLoP and Lr19 genes into elite cultivars of wheat, and the development of a genetic map will accelerate the map-based cloning of these two genes."

"20410663","abstracttext","Mitochondrial functions are potential targets of abiotic stresses that are major environmental factors limiting plant development and productivity. To evaluate mitochondrial responses to abiotic stresses we studied mitochondrial transcriptome profiles at the early stages of wheat development after imbibition under normal and induced stress conditions. Three stresses given were low temperature (4 degrees C), high salinity (0.2 M NaCl) and high osmotic potential (0.3 M mannitol). All these stresses greatly reduced growth but dramatically increased respiration both via the cytochrome and alternative pathways. Macroarray analysis of the mitochondrial transcriptome revealed that most of the changes in transcript levels were stress specific but groups of genes responded commonly to different stresses. Under 3-days continuous stresses, 13 genes showed low temperature specific responses with either up- or down-regulation, while 14 and 23 genes showed responses specific to high salinity and high osmotic potential, respectively. On the other hand, 13 genes showed common responses, among which cob and ccmFn increased their transcript levels while transcripts of the other genes including nad6, atp4 and atp9 decreased. The differential profiles of mitochondrial transcriptome revealed by the macroarray analysis were verified by the quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR analysis. Taken together, three among five nuclear-encoded mitochondria-targeted genes included in the array showed decreases under the stresses, while MnSOD and AOX increased their transcript amounts. Our results indicated the existence of common and different regulatory mechanisms that can sense different abiotic stresses and modulate both nuclear and mitochondrial gene expression in germinating wheat embryos and seedlings."

"21237221","abstracttext","In an effort to increase ethanol productivity during the consolidated bioprocessing (CBP) of lignocellulosics by Fusarium oxysporum, we attempted the constitutive homologous overexpression of one of the key process enzymes, namely an endo-xylanase. The endo-β-1,4-xylanase 2 gene was incorporated into the F. oxysporum genome under the regulation of the gpdA promoter of Aspergillus nidulans. The transformation was effected through Agrobacterium tumefaciens and resulted in 12 transformants, two of which were selected for further study due to their high extracellular xylanase activities under normally repressing conditions (glucose as sole carbon source). During natural induction conditions (growth on xylan) though, the extracellular enzyme levels of the transformants were only marginally higher (5-10%) compared to the wild type despite the significantly stronger xylanase 2 mRNA signals. SDS-PAGE verified enzyme assay results that there was no intracellular xylanase 2 accumulation in the transformants, suggesting the potential regulation in a post transcriptional or translational level. The fermentative performance of the transformants was evaluated and compared to that of the wild type in simple CBP systems using either corn cob or wheat bran as sole carbon sources. Both transformants produced approximately 60% more ethanol compared to the wild type on corn cob, while for wheat bran this picture was repeated for only one of them. This result is attributed to the high extracellular xylanase activities in the transformants' fermentation broths that were maintained 2-2.5-fold higher compared to the wild type."

"21280219","abstracttext","Puccinia triticina (Pt) is a representative of several cereal-infecting rust fungal pathogens of major economic importance world wide. Upon entry through leaf stomata, these fungi establish intracellular haustoria, crucial feeding structures. We report the first proteome of infection structures from parasitized wheat leaves, enriched for haustoria through filtration and sucrose density centrifugation. 2-D PAGE MS/MS and gel-based LC-MS (GeLC-MS) were used to separate proteins. Generated spectra were compared with a partial proteome predicted from a preliminary Pt genome and generated ESTs, to a comprehensive genome-predicted protein complement from the related wheat stem rust fungus, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) and to various plant resources. We identified over 260 fungal proteins, 16 of which matched peptides from Pgt. Based on bioinformatic analyses and/or the presence of a signal peptide, at least 50 proteins were predicted to be secreted. Among those, six have effector protein signatures, some are related and the respective genes of several seem to belong to clusters. Many ribosomal structural proteins, proteins involved in energy, general metabolism and transport were detected. Measuring gene expression over several life cycle stages of ten representative candidates using quantitative RT-PCR, all were shown to be strongly upregulated and four expressed solely upon infection."
"21365016","articletitle","Genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium in Chinese bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) revealed by SSR markers."
"21365016","abstracttext","Two hundred and fifty bread wheat lines, mainly Chinese mini core accessions, were assayed for polymorphism and linkage disequilibrium (LD) based on 512 whole-genome microsatellite loci representing a mean marker density of 5.1 cM. A total of 6,724 alleles ranging from 1 to 49 per locus were identified in all collections. The mean PIC value was 0.650, ranging from 0 to 0.965. Population structure and principal coordinate analysis revealed that landraces and modern varieties were two relatively independent genetic sub-groups. Landraces had a higher allelic diversity than modern varieties with respect to both genomes and chromosomes in terms of total number of alleles and allelic richness. 3,833 (57.0%) and 2,788 (41.5%) rare alleles with frequencies of <5% were found in the landrace and modern variety gene pools, respectively, indicating greater numbers of rare variants, or likely new alleles, in landraces. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that A genome had the largest genetic differentiation and D genome the lowest. In contrast to genetic diversity, modern varieties displayed a wider average LD decay across the whole genome for locus pairs with r(2)>0.05 (P<0.001) than the landraces. Mean LD decay distance for the landraces at the whole genome level was <5 cM, while a higher LD decay distance of 5-10 cM in modern varieties. LD decay distances were also somewhat different for each of the 21 chromosomes, being higher for most of the chromosomes in modern varieties (<5 ∼ 25 cM) compared to landraces (<5 ∼ 15 cM), presumably indicating the influences of domestication and breeding. This study facilitates predicting the marker density required to effectively associate genotypes with traits in Chinese wheat genetic resources."

"21739138","abstracttext","Qfhi.nau-5A is a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) against Fusarium graminearum infection in the resistant wheat germplasm Wangshuibai. Genetic analysis using BC(3)F(2) and BC(4)F(2) populations, derived from selfing two near-isogenic lines (NIL) heterozygous at Qfhi.nau-5A that were developed, respectively, with Mianyang 99-323 and PH691 as the recurrent parent, showed that Qfhi.nau-5A inherited like a single dominant gene. This QTL was thus designated as Fhb5. To fine map it, these two backcross populations and a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from Nanda2419 × Wangshuibai were screened for recombinants occurring between its two flanking markers Xbarc56 and Xbarc100. Nineteen NIL recombinants were identified from the two backcross populations and nine from the RIL population. In the RIL recombinant selection process, selection against Fhb4 present in the RIL population was incorporated. Genotyping these recombinant lines with ten markers mapping to the Xbarc56-Xbarc100 interval revealed four types of Mianyang 99-323-derived NIL recombinants, three types of PH691-derived NIL recombinants, and four types of RIL recombinants. In different field trials, the percentage of infected spikes of these lines displayed a distinct two-peak distribution. The more resistant class had over 55% less infection than the susceptible class. Common to these resistant genotypes, the 0.3-cM interval flanked by Xgwm304 and Xgwm415 or one of these two loci was derived from Wangshuibai, while none of the susceptible recombinants had Wangshuibai chromatin in this interval. This interval harboring Fhb5 was mapped to the pericentromeric C-5AS3-0.75 bin through deletion bin mapping. The precise localization of Fhb5 will facilitate its utilization in marker-assisted wheat breeding programs."

"22138981","abstracttext","Natural antibiotics are thought to function in the defense, fitness, competitiveness, biocontrol activity, communication, and gene regulation of microorganisms. However, the scale and quantitative aspects of antibiotic production in natural settings are poorly understood. We addressed these fundamental questions by assessing the geographic distribution of indigenous phenazine-producing (Phz(+)) Pseudomonas spp. and the accumulation of the broad-spectrum antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) in the rhizosphere of wheat grown in the low-precipitation zone (<350 mm) of the Columbia Plateau and in adjacent, higher-precipitation areas. Plants were collected from 61 commercial wheat fields located within an area of about 22,000 km(2). Phz(+) Pseudomonas spp. were detected in all sampled fields, with mean population sizes ranging from log 3.2 to log 7.1 g(-1) (fresh weight) of roots. Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant inverse relationship between annual precipitation and the proportion of plants colonized by Phz(+) Pseudomonas spp. (r(2) = 0.36, P = 0.0001). PCA was detected at up to nanomolar concentrations in the rhizosphere of plants from 26 of 29 fields that were selected for antibiotic quantitation. There was a direct relationship between the amount of PCA extracted from the rhizosphere and the population density of Phz(+) pseudomonads (r(2) = 0.46, P = 0.0006). This is the first demonstration of accumulation of significant quantities of a natural antibiotic across a terrestrial ecosystem. Our results strongly suggest that natural antibiotics can transiently accumulate in the plant rhizosphere in amounts sufficient not only for inter- and intraspecies signaling but also for the direct inhibition of sensitive organisms."

"22350093","abstracttext","Following the appearance of stripe rust in South Africa in 1996, efforts have been made to identify new sources of durable resistance. The French cultivar Cappelle-Desprez has long been considered a source of durable, adult plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust. As Cappelle-Desprez contains the seedling resistance genes Yr3a and Yr4a, wheat lines were developed from which Yr3a and Yr4a had been removed, while selecting for Cappelle-Desprez derived APR effective against South African pathotypes of the stripe rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. Line Yr16DH70, adapted to South African wheat growing conditions, was selected and crossed to the stripe rust susceptible cultivar Palmiet to develop a segregating recombinant inbred line mapping population. A major effect QTL, QYr.ufs-2A was identified on the short arm of chromosome 2A derived from Cappelle-Desprez, along with three QTL of smaller effect, QYr.ufs-2D, QYr.ufs-5B and QYr.ufs-6D. QYr.ufs-2D was located within a region on the short arm of chromosome 2D believed to be the location of the stripe rust resistance gene Yr16. An additional minor effect QTL, QYr.ufs-4B, was identified in the cv. Palmiet. An examination of individual RILs carrying single or combinations of each QTL indicated significant resistance effects when QYr.ufs-2A was combined with the three minor QTL from Cappelle-Desprez, and between QYr.ufs-2D and QYr.ufs-5B."
"22366813","articletitle","The distal portion of the short arm of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) chromosome 5D controls endosperm vitreosity and grain hardness."
"22366813","abstracttext","Kernel vitreosity is an important trait of wheat grain, but its developmental control is not completely known. We developed back-cross seven (BC(7)) near-isogenic lines in the soft white spring wheat cultivar Alpowa that lack the distal portion of chromosome 5D short arm. From the final back-cross, 46 BC(7)F(2) plants were isolated. These plants exhibited a complete and perfect association between kernel vitreosity (i.e. vitreous, non-vitreous or mixed) and Single Kernel Characterization System (SKCS) hardness. Observed segregation of 10:28:7 fit a 1:2:1 Chi-square. BC(7)F(2) plants classified as heterozygous for both SKCS hardness and kernel vitreosity (n = 29) were selected and a single vitreous and non-vitreous kernel were selected, and grown to maturity and subjected to SKCS analysis. The resultant phenotypic ratios were, from non-vitreous kernels, 23:6:0, and from vitreous kernels, 0:1:28, soft:heterozygous:hard, respectively. Three of these BC(7)F(2) heterozygous plants were selected and 40 kernels each drawn at random, grown to maturity and subjected to SKCS analysis. Phenotypic segregation ratios were 7:27:6, 11:20:9, and 3:28:9, soft:heterozygous:hard. Chi-square analysis supported a 1:2:1 segregation for one plant but not the other two, in which cases the two homozygous classes were under-represented. Twenty-two paired BC(7)F(2):F(3) full sibs were compared for kernel hardness, weight, size, density and protein content. SKCS hardness index differed markedly, 29.4 for the lines with a complete 5DS, and 88.6 for the lines possessing the deletion. The soft non-vitreous kernels were on average significantly heavier, by nearly 20%, and were slightly larger. Density and protein contents were similar, however. The results provide strong genetic evidence that gene(s) on distal 5DS control not only kernel hardness but also the manner in which the endosperm develops, viz. whether it is vitreous or non-vitreous."
"22372488","articletitle","The impact of photoperiod insensitive Ppd-1a mutations on the photoperiod pathway across the three genomes of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum)."
"22372488","abstracttext","Flowering time is a trait that has been extensively altered during wheat domestication, enabling it to be highly productive in diverse environments and providing a rich source of variation for studying adaptation mechanisms. Hexaploid wheat is ancestrally a long-day plant, but many environments require varieties with photoperiod insensitivity (PI) that can flower in short days. PI results from mutations in the Ppd-1 gene on the A, B or D genomes, with individual mutations conferring different degrees of earliness. The basis of this is poorly understood. Using a common genetic background, the effects of A, B and D genome PI mutations on genes of the circadian clock and photoperiod pathway were studied using genome-specific expression assays. Ppd-1 PI mutations did not affect the clock or immediate clock outputs, but affected TaCO1 and TaFT1, with a reduction in TaCO1 expression as TaFT1 expression increased. Therefore, although Ppd-1 is related to PRR genes of the Arabidopsis circadian clock, Ppd-1 affects flowering by an alternative route, most likely by upregulating TaFT1 with a feedback effect that reduces TaCO1 expression. Individual genes in the circadian clock and photoperiod pathway were predominantly expressed from one genome, and there was no genome specificity in Ppd-1 action. Lines combining PI mutations on two or three genomes had enhanced earliness with higher levels, but not earlier induction, of TaFT1, showing that there is a direct quantitative relationship between Ppd-1 mutations, TaFT1 expression and flowering."

"22378943","abstracttext","Arabinoxylan arabinofuranohydrolases (AXAHs) are family GH51 enzymes that have been implicated in the removal of arabinofuranosyl residues from the (1,4)-β-xylan backbone of heteroxylans. Five genes encoding barley AXAHs range in size from 4.6 kb to 7.1 kb and each contains 16 introns. The barley HvAXAH genes map to chromosomes 2H, 4H, and 5H. A small cluster of three HvAXAH genes is located on chromosome 4H and there is evidence for gene duplication and the presence of pseudogenes in barley. The cDNAs corresponding to barley and wheat AXAH genes were cloned, and transcript levels of the genes were profiled across a range of tissues at different developmental stages. Two HvAXAH cDNAs that were successfully expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves exhibited similar activities against 4-nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside, but HvAXAH2 activity was significantly higher against wheat flour arabinoxylan, compared with HvAXAH1. HvAXAH2 also displayed activity against (1,5)-α-L-arabinopentaose and debranched arabinan. Western blotting with an anti-HvAXAH antibody was used to define further the locations of the AXAH enzymes in developing barley grain, where high levels were detected in the outer layers of the grain but little or no protein was detected in the endosperm. The chromosomal locations of the genes do not correspond to any previously identified genomic regions shown to influence heteroxylan structure. The data are therefore consistent with a role for AXAH in depolymerizing arabinoxylans in maternal tissues during grain development, but do not provide compelling evidence for a role in remodelling arabinoxylans during endosperm or coleoptile development in barley as previously proposed."

Transgenic lines expressing one or both the 1-SST and the 6-SFT accumulated 50% less starch and 10-20 times more fructan, particularly 6-kestose, in the dry seed compared to the untransformed wild-type (WT) triticale; other fructans ranged in size from DP 4 to DP 15. During germination from 1 to 4 days after imbibition (dai), fructans were rapidly metabolized and only in transgenic lines expressing both 1-SST and 6-SFT were fructan contents significantly higher than in the untransformed controls after 4 days. In situ hybridization confirmed expression of 6-SFT in the aleurone layer in imbibed seeds of transformed plants. When transgenic lines were subjected to a cold stress of 4°C for 2 days, synthesis of fructan increased compared to untransformed controls during low-temperature germination. The increase of fructan in dry seed and germinating seedling was generally associated with transcript expression levels in transformed plants but total gene expression was not necessarily correlated with the time course accumulation of fructan during germination. This is the first report of transgenic modification of cereals to achieve production of fructans in cereal seeds and during seed germination."

Xyn-b39 exhibited maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 60 °C, and remained highly active under alkaline conditions (more than 80 % activity at pH 9.0 and 40 % activity at pH 10.0). The enzyme was thermostable at 55 °C, retaining more than 90 % of the initial activity after 2 h pre-incubation. Xyn-b39 had wide substrate specificity and hydrolyzed soluble substrates (birchwood xylan, beechwood xylan, oat spelt xylan, wheat arabinoxylan) and insoluble substrates (oat spelt xylan and wheat arabinoxylan). Hydrolysis product analysis indicated that Xyn-b39 was an endo-type xylanase. The K (m) and V (max) values of Xyn-b39 for birchwood xylan were 1.01 mg/mL and 73.53 U/min/mg, respectively.

"23132344","abstracttext","Biological soil disinfestation (BSD) involves the anaerobic decomposition of plant biomass by microbial communities leading to control of plant pathogens. We analyzed bacterial communities in soil of a model experiment of BSD, as affected by biomass incorporation under various conditions, to find out the major anaerobic bacterial groups which emerged after BSD treatments. The soil was treated with Brassica juncea plants, wheat bran, or Avena strigosa plants, irrigated at 20 or 30 % moisture content and incubated at 25-30 °C for 17 days. The population of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae incorporated at the start of the experiment declined markedly for some BSD conditions and rather high concentrations of acetate and butyrate were detected from these BSD-treated soils. The polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis based on the V3 region of 16S rRNA gene sequences from the soil DNA revealed that bacterial profiles greatly changed according to the treatment conditions. Based on the clone library analysis, phylogenetically diverse clostridial species appeared exceedingly dominant in the bacterial community of BSD soil incorporated with Brassica plants or wheat bran, in which the pathogen was suppressed completely. Species in the class Clostridia such as Clostridium saccharobutylicum, Clostridium acetobutylicum, Clostridium xylanovorans, Oxobacter pfennigii, Clostridium pasteurianum, Clostridium sufflavum, Clostridium cylindrosporum, etc. were commonly recognized as closely related species of the dominant clone groups from these soil samples."

"23332829","abstracttext","Methionine (Met) plays an important role in various cellular processes in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Cystathionine gamma-synthase encoded by STR2 gene is a key enzyme in Met biosynthesis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In this study, we identified FgMETB, a homologue of S. cerevisiae STR2, from Fusarium graminearum using the Protein Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTP) program. The FgMETB deletion mutants were unable to grow on fructose gelatin agar (FGA) medium containing SO(4)(2-) as sole sulphur source. In addition, more than 90 % conidia of the mutants were not able to germinate in 2 % sucrose solution within 6 or 12 h of incubation. Supplementation of 1 mM Met or 0.5 mg ml(-1) homocysteine, but not 1 mM cysteine or 0.5 mg ml(-1) glutathione, rescued the defect of mycelial growth and spore germination of FgMETB deletion mutants. These results indicated that the enzyme encoded by FgMETB is involved in conversion of cysteine into homocysteine. Inoculation tests showed that the FgMETB deletion mutant exhibited decreased virulence significantly on wheat heads, which is consistent with a low level of deoxynivalenol (DON) production of the mutant in wheat kernels. Fungicide sensitivity assays revealed FgMETB deletion mutants showed increased sensitivity to the sterol demethylation inhibitor tebuconazole, but did not change their sensitivities to other fungicides. Taken together, results of this study indicated that FgMETB plays a critical role in the regulation of various cellular processes in F. graminearum."

In this study, we aimed to map earliness per se quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting days to flowering and maturity in a population developed by crossing two spring wheat cultivars, Cutler and AC Barrie. The population of 177 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was genotyped for a total of 488 SSR and DArT polymorphic markers on all 21 chromosomes. Three QTLs of earliness per se affecting days to flowering and maturity were mapped on chromosomes 1B (QEps.dms-1B1 and QEps.dms-1B2) and 5B (QEps.dms-5B1), in individual environments and when all the environments were combined. A QTL affecting flowering time (QFlt.dms-4A1) was identified on chromosome 4A. Two grain yield QTLs were mapped on chromosome 5B, while one QTL was mapped on chromosome 1D. The population segregated for the photoperiod insensitive gene, Ppd-D1a, and it induced earlier flowering by 0.69 days and maturity by 1.28 days. The photoperiod insensitive allele Ppd-D1a interacted in an additive fashion with QTLs for flowering and maturity times. The earliness per se QTL QFlt.dms-5B.1 inducing earlier flowering could help to elongate grain filling duration for higher grain yield. Hence, chromosome 5B possesses promising genomic regions that may be introgressed for higher grain yield with earlier maturity through marker-assisted selection in bread wheat."

In the F2 populations, Qflw.nau-5A was inherited like a semi-dominant gene, and was therefore designated as TaFLW1. The FLW of the recombinant lines displayed a distinct two-peak distribution. Recombinants with wider leaves commonly have Mianyang 99-323 or PH691 chromatin in the 0.2 cM Xwmc492-Xwmc752 interval that resided in the 5AL12-0.35-0.57 deletion bin, and recombinants with narrow leaves were Wangshuibai genotype in this interval. Phenotypic recombination between FLW and type I FHB resistance was identified, implying TaFLW1 was in close linkage with Fhb5.

In the present study, the effects of Rht12 were characterized by analyzing its effects on seeding vigour, seedling roots, leaf and stem morphology, spike development and carbohydrate assimilation and distribution. This was carried out in the four genotypes of F2:3 lines derived from a cross between Ningchun45 and Karcagi (12) in two experiments of autumn sowing and spring sowing. Rht12 significantly decreased stem length (43%∼48% for peduncle) and leaf length (25%∼30% for flag leaf) while the thickness of the internode walls and width of the leaves were increased. Though the final plant stature was shortened (40%) by Rht12, the seedling vigour, especially coleoptile length and root traits at the seedling stage, were not affected adversely. Rht12 elongated the duration of the spike development phase, improved the proportion of spike dry weight at anthesis and significantly increased floret fertility (14%) in the autumn sowing experiment. However, Rht12 delayed anthesis date by around 5 days and even the dominant Vrn-B1 allele could not compensate this negative effect. Additionally, grain size was reduced with the ability to support spike development after anthesis decreased in Rht12 lines. Finally, grain yield was similar between the dwarf and tall lines in the autumn sowing experiment. Thus, Rht12 could substantially reduce plant height without altering seeding vigour and significantly increase spikelet fertility in the favourable autumn sowing environment. The successful utilization of Rht12 in breeding programs will require careful selection since it might delay ear emergence. Nonetheless, the potential exists for wheat improvement by using Rht12."

"23335774","abstracttext","We cloned a Paenibacillus sp. strain E18 5.3-kb xylanolytic gene cluster that contains three open reading frames encoding two family 43 α-L-arabinofuranosidases (Abf43A and Abf43B) and one family 10 xylanase (XynBE18). The deduced amino acid sequences of Abf43A and Abf43B were at most 68% and 63% identical to those of two putative family 43 proteins from Clostridium sp. strain DL-VIII (EHI98634.1 and EHI98635.1), respectively, but were only 11% identical to each other. Recombinant Abf43A and Abf43B had similar activities at 45°C and pH 6.0 but varied in thermostabilities and substrate specificities. Abf43B was active against only 4-nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside, whereas Abf43A acted on 4-nitrophenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside, wheat arabinoxylan, 4-nitrophenyl α-D-xylopyranoside, and sugar beet arabinan. The sequential and combined effects on xylan degradation by XynBE18, Abf43A, and Abf43B were characterized. For beechwood, birchwood, and oat spelt xylans as the substrates, synergistic effects were found when XynBE18 and Abf43A or Abf43B were incubated together and when the substrates were first incubated with Abf43A or Abf43B and then with XynBE18. Further high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the amounts of xylobiose and xylose increased sharply in the aforementioned reactions. For water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan as the substrate, Abf43A not only released arabinose but also had a synergistic effect with XynBE18. Synergy may arise as the result of removal of arabinose residues from xylans by α-L-arabinofuranosidases, which eliminates steric hindrance caused by the arabinose side chains and which allows xylanases to then degrade the xylan backbone, producing short xylooligosaccharides."

"23936230","abstracttext","Celiac disease is a common small intestinal inflammatory condition induced by wheat gluten and related proteins from rye and barley. Left untreated, the clinical presentation of CD can include failure to thrive, malnutrition, and distension in juveniles. The disease can additionally lead to vitamin deficiencies, anemia, and osteoporosis. Therefore, CD potentially negatively affected fitness in past populations utilizing wheat, barley, and rye. Previous analyses of CD risk variants have uncovered evidence for positive selection on some of these loci. These studies also suggest the possibility that risk for common autoimmune conditions such as CD may be the result of positive selection on immune related loci in the genome to fight infection. Under this evolutionary scenario, disease phenotypes may be a trade-off from positive selection on immunity. If this hypothesis is generally true, we can expect to find a signal of natural selection when we survey across the network of loci known to influence CD risk. This study examines the non-HLA autosomal network of gene loci associated with CD risk in Europe. We reject the null hypothesis of neutrality on this network of CD risk loci. Additionally, we can localize evidence of selection in time and space by adding information from the genome of the Tyrolean Iceman. While we can show significant differentiation between continental regions across the CD network, the pattern of evidence is not consistent with primarily recent (Holocene) selection across this network in Europe. Further localization of ancient selection on this network may illuminate the ecological pressures acting on the immune system during this critically interesting phase of our evolution."

"24795841","abstracttext","CdCl2 salt is widely used in exposure oriented studies, while the biological exposure of Cadmium (Cd) occurs mostly through diet. Hence, we designed a in vivo imaging methodology with sexually immature male ERE-Luc reporter mice to test the estrogen-like (EL) effects of Cd as a natural component in wheat and flax bread based diets (containing 17.57 and 49.22 ug/kg Cd concentrations respectively) and CdCl2 per-oral dose of 1 ug/kg/bw/day. Total exposure of ingested and % bioaccumulation of Cd in selected organs were estimated as 547 ng (4.4%), 776 ng (0.3%) and 2131.8 ng (0.1%) corresponding to CdCl2, wheat and flax bread based diet treatments respectively. Cd from CdCl2 bioaccumulated more readily, despite the exposure of Cd is higher with bread based diets. Longitudinal in vivo imaging did not reveal significant changes in luciferase activity. White adipose tissue (WAT) and prostate were identified as novel target organs of Cd. Indeed, the rest of the observed EL effects, endogenous target gene expression and necropsy findings are not consistent to any particular organ or treatment. This implies that, the observed EL effects due to low doses of Cd (either from CdCl2 or dietary form) occur only as subtle changes at the molecular level, but inadequate to cause significant changes at the anatomo-pathological level during the 21 day exposure period. The study demonstrates the sensitivity of the methodology to assess EL effects of food embedded Cd and underlines the limitations of directly extrapolating the results of suspected chemicals in their pure form to dietary exposure scenarios."

"24096427","abstracttext","The bacterial ecology during rye and wheat sourdough preparation was described by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing. Viable plate counts of presumptive lactic acid bacteria, the ratio between lactic acid bacteria and yeasts, the rate of acidification, a permutation analysis based on biochemical and microbial features, the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and diversity indices all together demonstrated the maturity of the sourdoughs during 5 to 7 days of propagation. Flours were mainly contaminated by metabolically active genera (Acinetobacter, Pantoea, Pseudomonas, Comamonas, Enterobacter, Erwinia, and Sphingomonas) belonging to the phylum Proteobacteria or Bacteroidetes (genus Chryseobacterium). Their relative abundances varied with the flour. Soon after 1 day of propagation, this population was almost completely inhibited except for the Enterobacteriaceae. Although members of the phylum Firmicutes were present at very low or intermediate relative abundances in the flours, they became dominant soon after 1 day of propagation. Lactic acid bacteria were almost exclusively representative of the Firmicutes by this time. Weissella spp. were already dominant in rye flour and stably persisted, though they were later flanked by the Lactobacillus sakei group. There was a succession of species during 10 days of propagation of wheat sourdoughs. The fluctuation between dominating and subdominating populations of L. sakei group, Leuconostoc spp., Weissella spp., and Lactococcus lactis was demonstrated. Other subdominant species such as Lactobacillus plantarum were detectable throughout propagation. As shown by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae dominated throughout the sourdough propagation. Notwithstanding variations due to environmental and technology determinants, the results of this study represent a clear example of how the microbial ecology evolves during sourdough preparation."

"24123271","abstracttext","One decade after the sequencing of the Plasmodium falciparum genome, 95% of malaria proteins in the genome cannot be expressed in traditional cell-based expression systems, and the targets of the best new leads for antimalarial drug discovery are either not known or not available in functional form. For a disease that kills up to 1 million people per year, routine expression of recombinant malaria proteins in functional form is needed both for the discovery of new therapeutics and for identification of targets of new drugs. We tested the general utility of cell-free systems for expressing malaria enzymes. Thirteen test enzyme sequences were reverse amplified from total RNA, cloned into a plant-like expression vector, and subjected to cell-free expression in a wheat germ system. Protein electrophoresis and autoradiography confirmed the synthesis of products of expected molecular masses. In rare problematic cases, truncated products were avoided by using synthetic genes carrying wheat codons. Scaled-up production generated 39 to 354 μg of soluble protein per 10 mg of translation lysate. Compared to rare proteins where cell-based systems do produce functional proteins, the cell-free yields are comparable or better. All 13 test products were enzymatically active, without failure. This general path to produce functional malaria proteins should now allow the community to access new tools, such as biologically active protein arrays, and lead to the discovery of new chemical functions, structures, and inhibitors of previously inaccessible malaria gene products."

"24113822","abstracttext","To develop a targeted metagenomics approach for the analysis of novel multispecies microbial consortia involved in the bioconversion of lignocellulose and furanic compounds, we applied replicated sequential batch aerobic enrichment cultures with either pretreated or untreated wheat straw as the sources of carbon and energy. After each transfer, exponential growth of bacteria was detected using microscopic cell counts, indicating that the substrate was being utilized. In batch, the final bacterial abundances increased from an estimated 5 to 8.7-9.5 log 16S rRNA gene copy numbers/ml. The abundances of fungal propagules showed greater variation, i.e., between 5.4 and 8.0 log ITS1 copies/ml. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analyses showed that the bacterial consortia in both treatments reached approximate structural stability after six transfers. Moreover, the structures of the fungal communities were strongly influenced by substrate treatment. A total of 124 bacterial strains were isolated from the two types of enrichment cultures. The most abundant strains were affiliated with the genera Raoultella/Klebsiella, Kluyvera, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Flavobacterium and Arthrobacter. Totals of 43 and 11 strains obtained from the untreated and pretreated substrates, respectively, showed (hemi)cellulolytic activity (CMC-ase and xylanase), whereas 96 strains were capable of growth in 7.5 mM 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. About 50 % of the latter showed extracellular oxidoreductase activity as detected by a novel iodide oxidation method. Also, (hemi)cellulolytic fungal strains related to Coniochaeta, Plectosphaerella and Penicillium were isolated. One Trichosporon strain was isolated from pretreated wheat straw. The two novel bacterial-fungal consortia are starting points for lignocellulose degradation applications."

Probes showing polymorphism were mapped on a barley RFLP map. Probes that were not polymorphic were assigned to chromosome arms using wheat-barley telosomic addition lines. The data suggested the presence of a single-copy gene corresponding to each of the cDNA probes. In addition to the major bands, several weaker cross-hybridizing bands indicated the presence of other, related sequences. The weaker bands were specific to each probe and were not due to cross-hybridization with the other probes examined here. The endosperm AGP small subunit (bepsF2) majorband locus was associated with chromosome 1P and designated Aga1. The endosperm AGP large subunit (bepl10) major-band locus was mapped to chromosome 5M and designated Aga7. The endosperm AGP large-subunit minor bands were not mapped. The leaf AGP large-subunit major band was associated with chromosome 7M and designated Aga5. One of the leaf AGP large-subunit minor bands was mapped to chromosome 5P and designated Aga6. A clone for the wheat endosperm AGP large-subunit (pAga7) hybridized to the same barley genomic DNA bands as the corresponding barley probe indicating a high degree of identity between the two probes."

"24019872","abstracttext","The SGT1 protein is essential for R protein-mediated and PAMPs-triggered resistance in many plant species. Here we reported the isolation and characterization of the Hv-SGT1 gene from Haynaldiavillosa (2n = 14, VV). Analysis of the subcellular location of Hv-SGT1 by transient expression of a fusion to GFP indicated its presence in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Levels of Hv-SGT1 transcripts were increased by inoculation with either the biotrophic pathogen Blumeriagraminis DC. f. Sp. tritici (Bgt) or the hemi-biotrophic pathogen Fusariumgraminearum (Fg). Levels of Hv-SGT1 showed substantial increase following treatment with H2O2 and methyl jasmonate (MeJA), only slightly induced following exposure to ethephon or abscisic acid, but not changed following exposure to salicylic acid. The demonstration that silencing of Hv-SGT1 substantially reduced resistance to Bgt indicated that Hv-SGT1 was an essential component of disease resistance in H. villosa. The over-expression of Hv-SGT1 in Yangmai 158 enhanced resistance to powdery mildew, and this correlated with increased levels of whole-cell reactive oxygen intermediates at the sites of penetration by the pathogens. Compared with wild-type plants, the expression levels of genes related to the H2O2 and JA signaling pathways were lower in the Hv-SGT1 silenced plants and higher in the Hv-SGT1 over-expressing plants. Therefore, the involvement of Hv-SGT1 in H2O2 production correlates with the hypersensitive response and jasmonic acid signaling. Our novel demonstration that wheat with over-expressed Hv-SGT1 showed enhanced resistance to both powdery mildew and FHB suggests that it could served as a transgenic genetic resource in wheat breeding for multiple disease resistance."

"24395202","abstracttext","We characterized two high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) variants from Eremopyrum bonaepartis, determined their complete open reading frames, and further expressed them in a bacterial system. The variants have many novel structural features compared with typical subunits encoded by Glu-1 loci: 1Fx3.7 and 1Fy1.5 exhibit hybrid properties of x- and y-type subunits. In addition, unusual molecular mass and altered number and distribution of cysteine residues were unique features of HMW-GSs encoded by Glu-F1 from E. bonaepartis. The mature 1Fx3.7 subunit has a full length of 1,223 amino acid residues, making it the largest subunit found thus far, while 1Fy1.5 is just 496 residues. In addition, the mutated PGQQ repeat motif was found in the repetitive region of 1Fx3.7. Although it has a similar molecular mass to that previously reported for 1Dx2.2, 1Dx2.2* and 1S(sh)x2.9 subunits, 1Fx3.7 appears to have had a different evolutionary history. The N-terminal and repetitive regions have a total of four additional cysteine residues, giving 1Fx3.7 a total of eight cysteines, while 1Fy1.5 has only six cysteines because the GHCPTSPQQ nonapeptide at the end of the repetitive region is deleted. With its extra cysteine residues and the longest repetitive region, features that are relevant to good wheat quality, the 1Fx3.7 subunit gene could be an excellent candidate for applications in wheat quality improvement."
"24509730","articletitle","Genetic control of rhizomes and genomic localization of a major-effect growth habit QTL in perennial wildrye."
"24509730","abstracttext","Rhizomes are prostrate subterranean stems that provide primitive mechanisms of vegetative dispersal, survival, and regrowth of perennial grasses and other monocots. The extent of rhizome proliferation varies greatly among grasses, being absent in cereals and other annuals, strictly confined in caespitose perennials, or highly invasive in some perennial weeds. However, genetic studies of rhizome proliferation are limited and genes controlling rhizomatous growth habit have not been elucidated. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling rhizome spreading were compared in reciprocal backcross populations derived from hybrids of rhizomatous creeping wildrye (Leymus triticoides) and caespitose basin wildrye (L. cinereus), which are perennial relatives of wheat. Two recessive QTLs were unique to the creeping wildrye backcross, one dominant QTL was unique to the basin wildrye backcross, and one additive QTL was detectable in reciprocal backcrosses with high log odds (LOD = 31.6) in the basin wildrye background. The dominant QTL located on linkage group (LG)-2a was aligned to a dominant rhizome orthogene (Rhz3) of perennial rice (Oryza longistamina) and perennial sorghum (Sorghum propinquum). Nonparametric 99 % confidence bounds of the 31.6-LOD QTL were localized to a distal 3.8-centiMorgan region of LG-6a, which corresponds to a 0.7-Mb region of Brachypodium Chromosome 3 containing 106 genes. An Aux/IAA auxin signal factor gene was located at the 31.6-LOD peak, which could explain the gravitropic and aphototropic behavior of rhizomes. Findings elucidate genetic mechanisms controlling rhizome development and architectural growth habit differences among plant species. Results have possible applications to improve perennial forage and turf grasses, extend the vegetative life cycle of annual cereals, such as wheat, or control the invasiveness of highly rhizomatous weeds such as quackgrass (Elymus repens)."

"24276539","abstracttext","Microbes are key components of the soil environment, playing an important role in maintaining soil health, sustainability, and productivity. The composition and structure of soil bacterial communities were examined in winter wheat-rice (WR) and winter wheat-maize (WM) cropping systems derived from five locations in the Low-Middle Yangtze River plain and the Huang-Huai-Hai plain by pyrosequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicons. A total of 102,367 high quality sequences were used for multivariate statistical analysis and to test for correlation between community structure and environmental variables such as crop rotations, soil properties, and locations. The most abundant phyla across all soil samples were Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Similar patterns of bacterial diversity and community structure were observed within the same cropping systems, and a higher relative abundance of anaerobic bacteria was found in WR compared to WM cropping systems. Variance partitioning analysis revealed complex relationships between bacterial community and environmental variables. The effect of crop rotations was low but significant, and interactions among soil properties, locations, and crop rotations accounted for most of the explained variation in the structure of bacterial communities. Soil properties such as pH, available P, and available K showed higher correlations (positive or negative) with the majority of the abundant taxa. Bacterial diversity (the Shannon index) and richness (Chao1 and ACE) were higher under WR than WM cropping systems."

"24303057","abstracttext","The disease septoria leaf blotch of wheat, caused by fungal pathogen Septoria tritici, is of worldwide concern. The fungus exhibits a hemibiotrophic lifestyle, with a long symptomless, biotrophic phase followed by a sudden transition to necrotrophy associated with host necrosis. Little is known about the systematic interaction between fungal pathogenicity and host responses at specific growth stages and the factors triggering the transition. In order to gain some insights into global transcriptome alterations in both host and pathogen during the two phases of the compatible interaction, disease transition was monitored using pathogenesis-related gene markers and H2O2 signature prior to RNA-Seq. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the slow symptomless growth was accompanied by minor metabolic responses and slightly suppressed defences in the host, whereas necrotrophic growth was associated with enhanced host responses involving energy metabolism, transport, signalling, defence and oxidative stress as well as a decrease in photosynthesis. The fungus expresses distinct classes of stage-specific genes encoding potential effectors, probably first suppressing plant defence responses/facilitating the symptomless growth and later triggering life style transition and inducing host necrosis/facilitating the necrotrophic growth. Transport, signalling, anti-oxidative stress mechanisms and apoplastic nutrient acquisition play important roles in the entire infection process of S. tritici. Our findings uncover systematic S. tritici-induced expression profiles of wheat related to specific fungal infection strategies and provide a transcriptome resource for studying both hosts and pathogens in plant-Dothideomycete interactions."

The performance of F1, B1, B2, F2, × p1, F2 × P2 and F2 × F1 progeny was midway between the parents involved with respect to all the evaluated characters. The biparental progeny excelled the mean performance of their corresponding F2 and F3 progeny in tiller number, seed weight and grain yield. The estimates of variance components obtained from the two models deployed were almost similar. Considerable additive genetic variance was observed for grains per spike, seed weight and grain yield while dominance variance was more pronounced for harvest index. The additive-dominance model was adequate for grains per spike and harvest index. Epistatic effects of additive × additive and additive × dominance type for tiller number and grain yield, and of additive × dominance type for seed weight were observed. The digenic epistatic model was inadequate for explaining the nature of gene action for tiller number, seed weight and grain yield. The studies indicated that non-allelic interactions should not be ignored in formulating wheat breeding programmes and that a biparental approach could be adopted as an extremely useful tool for enhancing genetic variability and the creation of transgressive segregants. The usefulness of breeding methodologies utilising a biparental approach is discussed."

"24197305","abstracttext","Chromosome 5B of bread wheat is known to carry two major genes giving rise to genetic disorders, Ne1 for hybrid necrosis and Vg for winter variegation. Additionally, in many european winter wheat varieties this chromosome is represented in a translocated form, with 5BL-7BL, 5BL-7BS chromosomes rather than the normal 5B and 7B forms of the standard variety Chinese Spring. Genetic analysis has been carried out to map these genes and the translocation break point, and to investigate their pleiotropic effects or those of linked quantitative trait loci (qtl) for economically important characters. This was facilitated by the development of single chromosome recombinant lines between a normal and translocated karyotype, and growing these in field experiments over two seasons. There was differential segregation in favour of the translocated karyotype in the population of recombinant lines. Linkage analysis revealed that the two morphological markers and the isozyme locus Ibf-B1 were located on the long arm of 5B with a gene order of: breakpoint - Ne1 - Vg - Ibf-B1. Analysis of quantitative characters using these genes as landmarks showed pleiotropic effects of Ne1 or effects of tightly linked qtl on most of the quantitative characters related to grain yield. An additional qtl determining spikelet and grain number/ear appeared to be linked to the centromere. Effects on ear emergence time were associated with both Ne1 and Vg, and these interacted with environments. Similarly, effects on plant height were associated with Ne1 and Vg. In addition, there was a further unlocated locus (loci) for height acting independently of the markers."

Noteworthy, the heat response in Cappelli involved also the up-regulation of genes belonging to fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, glyoxylate cycle and senescence, suggesting an early activation of senescence in this cv. A gene of unknown function having the greatest expression difference between the two cultivars was selected and used for expression QTL analysis, the corresponding QTL was mapped on chromosome 6B."

In Ofanto the combination of drought and heat stress led to an increased number of modulated genes, exceeding the simple cumulative effects of the two single stresses, whereas in Cappelli the same treatment triggered a number of differentially expressed genes lower than those altered in response to heat stress alone. This work provides clear evidences that the genetic system based on Cappelli and Ofanto represents an ideal tool for the genetic dissection of the molecular response to drought and other abiotic stresses."

We assessed whether 64 16S rRNA microarray probes whose signals correlated with tobacco black root rot suppressiveness in greenhouse analysis could also discriminate suppressive from conducive soils under field conditions. Rhizobacterial communities of tobacco and wheat sampled in 2 years from four farmers' fields of contrasted suppressiveness status were compared. The 64 previously identified indicator probes correctly classified 72% of 29 field samples, with nine probes for Azospirillum, Gluconacetobacter, Sphingomonadaceae, Planctomycetes, Mycoplasma, Lactobacillus crispatus and Thermodesulforhabdus providing the best prediction. The whole probe set (1033 probes) revealed strong effects of plant, field location and year on rhizobacterial community composition, and a smaller (7% variance) but significant effect of soil suppressiveness status. Seventeen additional probes correlating with suppressiveness status in the field (noticeably for Agrobacterium, Methylobacterium, Ochrobactrum) were selected, and combined with the nine others, they improved correct sample classification from 72% to 79% (100% tobacco and 63% wheat samples). Pseudomonas probes were not informative in the field, even those targeting biocontrol pseudomonads producing 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, nor was quantitative polymerase chain reaction for 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol-synthesis gene phlD. This study shows that a subset of 16S rRNA probes targeting diverse rhizobacteria can be useful as suppressiveness indicators under field conditions."

"25120168","abstracttext","Among cereals, Avena sativa is characterized by an extremely soft endosperm texture, which leads to some negative agronomic and technological traits. On the basis of the well-known softening effect of puroindolines in wheat kernel texture, in this study, indolines and their encoding genes are investigated in Avena species at different ploidy levels. Three novel 14 kDa proteins, showing a central hydrophobic domain with four tryptophan residues and here named vromindoline (VIN)-1,2 and 3, were identified. Each VIN protein in diploid oat species was found to be synthesized by a single Vin gene whereas, in hexaploid A. sativa, three Vin-1, three Vin-2 and two Vin-3 genes coding for VIN-1, VIN-2 and VIN-3, respectively, were described and assigned to the A, C or D genomes based on similarity to their counterparts in diploid species. Expression of oat vromindoline transgenes in the extra-hard durum wheat led to accumulation of vromindolines in the endosperm and caused an approximate 50 % reduction of grain hardness, suggesting a central role for vromindolines in causing the extra-soft texture of oat grain. Further, hexaploid oats showed three orthologous genes coding for avenoindolines A and B, with five or three tryptophan residues, respectively, but very low amounts of avenoindolines were found in mature kernels. The present results identify a novel protein family affecting cereal kernel texture and would further elucidate the phylogenetic evolution of Avena genus."

This fungus shows a high genetic diversity and morphological and physiologic variability. In this study, 19 polysporic and 57 monosporic isolates of B. sorokiniana were characterized using universal rice primers-URP-PCR. The results obtained when the dendrogram was constructed with all the data produced with the amplification products showed very distinct clusters. However, the similarity among the isolates was low where 37 and 26.3 % of the monosporic and polysporic isolates, respectively, showed similarity above 70 %. All primers amplified multiple DNA fragments of polysporic as well as the monosporic isolates. Isolates fingerprints were constructed based on binary characters revealed by the three primers. An amplified fragment of approximately 750 bp was observed among 40 % of the isolates, when primer URP-1F was used. When primers URP-4R and URP-2R were used, a fragment of 450 and 400 bp was present in 31.5 and 29 % of the isolates, respectively. It was expected a higher similarity among the isolates since the monosporic cultures were originated from the polysporic. The dendrogram did not enable the separation of B. sorokiniana isolates by their geographic origin. This low correlation suggests that gene transfer may have occurred by parasexual combination in this fungus population. However, in spite of the research efforts for that end, it has not been possible to establish patterns that characterize the profile of B. sorokiniana."

As compared to A. speltoides, A. tauschii suffered less inhibition of photosystem II efficiency and net photosynthetic rate (Pn). Although A. tauschii showed nearly complete recovery of PSII, the adverse effect was more pronounced in A. speltoides. Measurement of the minimum fluorescence (Fo) versus temperature curves revealed a higher inflection temperature of Fo for A. tauschii than A. speltoides, reflecting greater thermo stability of the photosynthetic apparatus. Absorbed light energy distribution revealed that A. speltoides showed increased steady state fluorescence and a lower absorbed light allocated to photosynthetic chemistry (ɸPSII) relative to A. tauschii. However, A. tauschii showed higher ability to scavenge free radicals as compared to A. speltoides. This was further validated by higher expression of ascorbate peroxidase gene. These results suggest that A. tauschii showed faster recovery and a better thermostability of its photosynthetic apparatus under severe stress conditions along with a better regulation of energy channeling of PSII complexes to minimize oxidative damage and thus retains greater capability of carbon assimilation. These factors aid in imparting a greater heat tolerance to A. tauschii as compared to A. speltoides and thus make it a better candidate for alien species introgression in wheat breeding programs for thermotolerance in wheat."
"26252567","articletitle","Factorial combinations of protein interactions generate a multiplicity of florigen activation complexes in wheat and barley."
"26252567","abstracttext","The FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein is a central component of a mobile flowering signal (florigen) that is transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Two FT monomers and two DNA-binding bZIP transcription factors interact with a dimeric 14-3-3 protein bridge to form a hexameric protein complex. This complex, designated as the 'florigen activation complex' (FAC), plays a critical role in flowering. The wheat homologue of FT, designated FT1 (= VRN3), activates expression of VRN1 in the leaves and the SAM, promoting flowering under inductive long days. In this study, we show that FT1, other FT-like proteins, and different FD-like proteins, can interact with multiple wheat and barley 14-3-3 proteins. We also identify the critical amino acid residues in FT1 and FD-like proteins required for their interactions, and demonstrate that 14-3-3 proteins are necessary bridges to mediate the FT1-TaFDL2 interaction. Using in vivo bimolecular fluorescent complementation (BiFC) assays, we demonstrate that the interaction between FT1 and 14-3-3 occurs in the cytoplasm, and that this complex is then translocated to the nucleus, where it interacts with TaFDL2 to form a FAC. We also demonstrate that a FAC including FT1, TaFDL2 and Ta14-3-3C can bind to the VRN1 promoter in vitro. Finally, we show that relative transcript levels of FD-like and 14-3-3 genes vary among tissues and developmental stages. Since FD-like proteins determine the DNA specificity of the FACs, variation in FD-like gene expression can result in spatial and temporal modulation of the effects of mobile FT-like signals."

"25382230","abstracttext","The identification of genetic markers linked to genes of agronomic importance is a major aim of crop research and breeding programmes. Here, we identify markers for Yr15, a major disease resistance gene for wheat yellow rust, using a segregating F2 population. After phenotyping, we implemented RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) of bulked pools to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) associated with Yr15. Over 27 000 genes with SNPs were identified between the parents, and then classified based on the results from the sequenced bulks. We calculated the bulk frequency ratio (BFR) of SNPs between resistant and susceptible bulks, selecting those showing sixfold enrichment/depletion in the corresponding bulks (BFR > 6). Using additional filtering criteria, we reduced the number of genes with a putative SNP to 175. The 35 SNPs with the highest BFR values were converted into genome-specific KASP assays using an automated bioinformatics pipeline (PolyMarker) which circumvents the limitations associated with the polyploid wheat genome. Twenty-eight assays were polymorphic of which 22 (63%) mapped in the same linkage group as Yr15. Using these markers, we mapped Yr15 to a 0.77-cM interval. The three most closely linked SNPs were tested across varieties and breeding lines representing UK elite germplasm. Two flanking markers were diagnostic in over 99% of lines tested, thus providing a reliable haplotype for marker-assisted selection in these breeding programmes. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be applied in polyploid F2 populations to generate high-resolution genetic maps across target intervals."
"25271260","articletitle","Fertility of CMS wheat is restored by two Rf loci located on a recombined acrocentric chromosome."
"25271260","abstracttext","Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) results from incompatibility between nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes, and is characterized by the inability to produce viable pollen. The restoration of male fertility generally involves the introgression of nuclear genes, termed restorers of fertility (Rf). CMS has been widely used for hybrid seed production in many crops but not in wheat, partly owing to the complex genetics of fertility restoration. In this study, an acrocentric chromosome that restores pollen fertility of CMS wheat in Hordeum chilense cytoplasm (msH1 system) is studied. The results show that this chromosome, of H. chilense origin and named H(ch)ac, originated from a complex reorganization of the short arm of chromosomes 1H(ch) (1H(ch)S) and 6H(ch) (6H(ch)S). Diversity arrays technology (DArT) markers and cytological analysis indicate that H(ch)ac is a kind of `zebra-like' chromosome composed of chromosome 1H(ch)S and alternate fragments of interstitial and distal regions of chromosome 6H(ch)S. PCR-based markers together with FISH, GISH, and meiotic pairing analysis support this result. A restorer of fertility gene, named Rf6H(ch)S, has been identified on the short arm of chromosome 6H(ch)S. Moreover, restoration by the addition of chromosome 1H(ch)S has been observed at a very low frequency and under certain environmental conditions. Therefore, the results indicate the presence of two Rf genes on the acrocentric chromosome: Rf6H(ch)S and Rf1H(ch)S, the restoration potential of Rf6H(ch)S being greater. The stable and high restoration of pollen fertility in the msH1 system is therefore the result of the interaction between these two restorer genes."

"25281897","abstracttext","Wheat storage protein genes, especially low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) and gliadin genes are difficult to be expressed in Escherichiacoli, mainly due to the presence of highly repetitive sequences. In order to establish a high efficiency expression system for these genes, five different expression plasmids combining with 9 genes, viz. 6 LMW-GS and 3 α-gliadin genes isolated from common wheat and related species, were studied for heterologous expression in E. coli. In this study, when an expressed tag sequence encoding signal peptide, His-S or GST-tag was fused to the 5' end of LMW-GS or gliadin gene as the leading sequence, all recombination genes could be stably expressed at a high level. On the contrast, as expected, the inserted genes encoding mature protein failed without an expressed tag sequence. This result indicated that using expressed tag sequences as leading sequences could promote LMW-GS and gliadin genes to be well expressed in E. coli. Further transcriptional analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) showed transcription levels of recombination genes (e.g. GST-Glutenin, His-S-Glutenin and SP(∗)-His-Glutenin) were 4-fold to 33-fold higher than those of the LMW-GS genes, which suggested these expressed tag sequences might play an important role in stimulating transcription. The possible molecular mechanism under this phenomenon was discussed."
"25265161","articletitle","Systems responses to progressive water stress in durum wheat."
"25265161","abstracttext","Durum wheat is susceptible to terminal drought which can greatly decrease grain yield. Breeding to improve crop yield is hampered by inadequate knowledge of how the physiological and metabolic changes caused by drought are related to gene expression. To gain better insight into mechanisms defining resistance to water stress we studied the physiological and transcriptome responses of three durum breeding lines varying for yield stability under drought. Parents of a mapping population (Lahn x Cham1) and a recombinant inbred line (RIL2219) showed lowered flag leaf relative water content, water potential and photosynthesis when subjected to controlled water stress time transient experiments over a six-day period. RIL2219 lost less water and showed constitutively higher stomatal conductance, photosynthesis, transpiration, abscisic acid content and enhanced osmotic adjustment at equivalent leaf water compared to parents, thus defining a physiological strategy for high yield stability under water stress. Parallel analysis of the flag leaf transcriptome under stress uncovered global trends of early changes in regulatory pathways, reconfiguration of primary and secondary metabolism and lowered expression of transcripts in photosynthesis in all three lines. Differences in the number of genes, magnitude and profile of their expression response were also established amongst the lines with a high number belonging to regulatory pathways. In addition, we documented a large number of genes showing constitutive differences in leaf transcript expression between the genotypes at control non-stress conditions. Principal Coordinates Analysis uncovered a high level of structure in the transcriptome response to water stress in each wheat line suggesting genome-wide co-ordination of transcription. Utilising a systems-based approach of analysing the integrated wheat's response to water stress, in terms of biological robustness theory, the findings suggest that each durum line transcriptome responded to water stress in a genome-specific manner which contributes to an overall different strategy of resistance to water stress."

"24849374","abstracttext","Cadmium usually hampers plant growth, but bacterial inoculation may improve stress tolerance in plants to Cd by involving various mechanisms. The objective was to characterize and identify bacteria that improve plant growth under Cd stress and reduce Cd uptake. Cadmium-tolerant bacteria were isolated from rhizosphere soil, which was irrigated with tannery effluent, and six strains were selected as highly tolerant to Cd, showing minimum inhibitory concentration as 500 mg L(-1) or 4.45 mmol L(-1). These strains were identified by 16S rRNA gene analysis and functional analysis in regard to plant growth promotion characteristics. To determine their effect on cereal growth under Cd stress, seeds were inoculated with these strains individually and grown in soil contaminated with three Cd levels (0, 40 and 80 mg kg(-1)). Biomass production, relative water content (RWC), electrolyte leakage (ELL) and tissue Cd concentration were measured. Biomass of both cereals was inhibited strongly when exposed to Cd; however, bacterial inoculation significantly reduced the suppressive effect of Cd on cereal growth and physiology. The bacterial isolates belonged to the genera Klebsiella, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus and Serratia. Maize was more sensitive than wheat to Cd. Klebsiella sp. strain CIK-502 had the most pronounced effects in promoting maize and wheat growth and lowering Cd uptake under Cd stress."
"26083253","articletitle","Two Cdc2 Kinase Genes with Distinct Functions in Vegetative and Infectious Hyphae in Fusarium graminearum."
"26083253","abstracttext","Eukaryotic cell cycle involves a number of protein kinases important for the onset and progression through mitosis, most of which are well characterized in the budding and fission yeasts and conserved in other fungi. However, unlike the model yeast and filamentous fungi that have a single Cdc2 essential for cell cycle progression, the wheat scab fungus Fusarium graminearum contains two CDC2 orthologs. The cdc2A and cdc2B mutants had no obvious defects in growth rate and conidiation but deletion of both of them is lethal, indicating that these two CDC2 orthologs have redundant functions during vegetative growth and asexual reproduction. However, whereas the cdc2B mutant was normal, the cdc2A mutant was significantly reduced in virulence and rarely produced ascospores. Although deletion of CDC2A had no obvious effect on the formation of penetration branches or hyphopodia, the cdc2A mutant was limited in the differentiation and growth of infectious growth in wheat tissues. Therefore, CDC2A plays stage-specific roles in cell cycle regulation during infectious growth and sexual reproduction. Both CDC2A and CDC2B are constitutively expressed but only CDC2A was up-regulated during plant infection and ascosporogenesis. Localization of Cdc2A- GFP to the nucleus but not Cdc2B-GFP was observed in vegetative hyphae, ascospores, and infectious hyphae. Complementation assays with chimeric fusion constructs showed that both the N- and C-terminal regions of Cdc2A are important for its functions in pathogenesis and ascosporogenesis but only the N-terminal region is important for its subcellular localization. Among the Sordariomycetes, only three Fusarium species closely related to F. graminearum have two CDC2 genes. Furthermore, F. graminearum uniquely has two Aurora kinase genes and one additional putative cyclin gene, and its orthologs of CAK1 and other four essential mitotic kinases in the budding yeast are dispensable for viability. Overall, our data indicate that cell cycle regulation is different between vegetative and infectious hyphae in F. graminearum and Cdc2A, possibly by interacting with a stage-specific cyclin, plays a more important role than Cdc2B during ascosporogenesis and plant infection."

"26052925","abstracttext","The potential impact of genetically modified (GM) crops on biodiversity is one of the main concerns in an environmental risk assessment (ERA). The likelihood of outcrossing and pollen-mediated gene flow from GM crops and non-GM crops are explained by the same principles and depend primarily on the biology of the species. We conducted a national-scale study of the likelihood of outcrossing between 11 GM crops and vascular plants in Chile by use of a systematized database that included cultivated, introduced and native plant species in Chile. The database included geographical distributions and key biological and agronomical characteristics for 3505 introduced, 4993 native and 257 cultivated (of which 11 were native and 246 were introduced) plant species. Out of the considered GM crops (cotton, soya bean, maize, grape, wheat, rice, sugar beet, alfalfa, canola, tomato and potato), only potato and tomato presented native relatives (66 species total). Introduced relative species showed that three GM groups were formed having: a) up to one introduced relative (cotton and soya bean), b) up to two (rice, grape, maize and wheat) and c) from two to seven (sugar beet, alfalfa, canola, tomato and potato). In particular, GM crops presenting introduced noncultivated relative species were canola (1 relative species), alfalfa (up to 4), rice (1), tomato (up to 2) and potato (up to 2). The outcrossing potential between species [OP; scaled from 'very low' (1) to 'very high' (5)] was developed, showing medium OPs (3) for GM-native relative interactions when they occurred, low (2) for GMs and introduced noncultivated and high (4) for the grape-Vitis vinifera GM-introduced cultivated interaction. This analytical tool might be useful for future ERA for unconfined GM crop release in Chile."

Xylanolytic bacteria were found to be common in ruminant dung. Seven Bacillus dung isolates exhibited high xylanolytic activity; three of which were identified as Bacillus safensis and four as Bacillus altitudinis, based on 16S rDNA and gyrB gene sequencing. Interestingly, comparison of activity profiles for B. safensis M35 and B. altitudinis R31 and J208 crude xylanases showed activity in similar temperature and pH ranges of 40-60 °C and 6·0-9·0, respectively, even though they were isolated from three different dung sources. Furthermore, 22-28% viscosity reduction of beechwood xylan substrate by all the three xylanases points towards their endo-acting nature. Endo-acting xylanases are envisaged as accessory enzymes which help expose the cellulose fibres for the subsequent action of the core enzyme cellulases. In this study, when supplemented to the commercial cellulase as a cocktail, the accessory role of the crude xylanases from the selected Bacillus strains was established as 1·3, 2·33 and 1·9 fold increase in saccharification of barley husk, sugarcane bagasse and wheat husk was achieved, respectively."

Ruminant dung isolates M35, R31 and J208 belonging to Bacillus sp. produces majorly endo-xylanase when induced with wheat bran. Such plant cell wall degrading endo-xylanases with broad pH optima and mesophilic nature can act as accessory enzymes with cellulases to enhance the saccharification of plant biomass in biofuel industries."

"26019562","abstracttext","The phenotypic variation in osmotic adjustment (OA) capacity of five Bulgarian winter durum wheat genotypes and their progenies was determined using a modified method based on the measurement of seedling growth suppression after three-day exposure to osmotic stress induced by 1 mol/L sucrose. The genetic parameters of the studied trait in a diallel crossing scheme, including the selected genotypes and the microsatellite polymorphism at 43 loci, were determined. The old Bulgarian cultivar Apulicum 233 and all hybrid combinations involving this genotype showed higher OA. In the heritability of osmoregulation ability, the non-additive gene effects (specific combining ability) strongly predominated over the additive ones and had a significant impact on the observed high heterosis effect. Distinct polymorphisms were identified between the studied genotypes. Cluster analysis of the phenotypic data obtained from a multiyear test under water-limited conditions and the molecular data, both based on Euclidean distance, showed similar grouping of the genotypes with specific separation of cultivar Apulicum 233 (high OA) in a single cluster. Principal component analysis revealed not only interrelationships between the important agronomic and morpho-physiological traits in Bulgarian durum wheat under water-limited conditions, but also presence of relations between them and some microsatellite loci located near or within known quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits. Further studies based on segregating population between genotypes with contrasting levels of OA will allow mapping QTLs for phenotypic traits expressed under water deficit and isolation of genes that can be used as potential markers in marker-assisted selection for drought tolerance."
"25870923","articletitle","Resistance to Puccinia graminis f. sp. avenae in Barley Is Associated with the Rpg5 Locus."
"25870923","abstracttext","In barley, gene Rpg5 was first identified for providing resistance to the rye stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. secalis). A subsequent study determined that Rpg5 is required for rpg4-mediated resistance to the wheat stem rust pathogen (P. graminis f. sp. tritici) including pathotype TTKSK (""Ug99""), which poses a major threat to global wheat and barley production. Based on the effectiveness of Rpg5 against P. graminis f. sp. tritici and P. graminis f. sp. secalis, we assessed whether it also conferred resistance to the oat stem rust pathogen (P. graminis f. sp. avenae). A barley F8 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was produced by crossing 'Q21861' (Rpg1 and Rpg5) with '73-G1' (Rpg1), which is susceptible to P. graminis f. sp. avenae, P. graminis f. sp. secalis, and some pathotypes of P. graminis f. sp. tritici. Seedling tests were performed on the F8 RIL population using Australian pathotypes of P. graminis f. sp. tritici, P. graminis f. sp. secalis, P. graminis f. sp. avenae, and a putative somatic hybrid between P. graminis f. sp. tritici and P. graminis f. sp. secalis known as the 'Scabrum' rust. Segregation in the responses to all rust isolates for the RILs was identical (50 resistant: 52 susceptible), and fitted a 1:1 ratio (X2=0.039, P=0.843), indicating that resistance to all isolates was monogenetically inherited. Screening of the RILs and the parental lines with perfect markers for the functional Rpg1 and Rpg5 resistance alleles indicated that Rpg1 was fixed, while Rpg5 was positive in all resistant lines and negative in all susceptible lines. This suggests that different formae speciales of P. graminis may share common effectors, and that the Rpg5 locus confers resistance to both P. graminis f. sp. tritici and P. graminis f. sp. secalis and the heterologous formae speciales of P. graminis, P. graminis f. sp. avenae."

"25652158","abstracttext","Biotrophic fungi, such as Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, because they cannot be cultured on nutrient media, to obtain adequate quantity of DNA for molecular genetic analysis, are usually propagated on living hosts, wheat plants in case of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. The propagation process is time-, space- and labor-consuming and has been a bottleneck to molecular genetic analysis of this pathogen. In this study we evaluated multiple displacement amplification (MDA) of pathogen genomic DNA from urediospores as an alternative approach to traditional propagation of urediospores followed by DNA extraction. The quantities of pathogen genomic DNA in the products were further determined via real-time PCR with a pair of primers specific for the β-tubulin gene of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fingerprints were also compared between the DNA products. The results demonstrated that adequate genomic DNA at fragment size larger than 23 Kb could be amplified from 20 to 30 urediospores via MDA method. The real-time PCR results suggested that although fresh urediospores collected from diseased leaves were the best, spores picked from diseased leaves stored for a prolonged period could also be used for amplification. AFLP fingerprints exhibited no significant differences between amplified DNA and DNA extracted with CTAB method, suggesting amplified DNA can represent the pathogen's genomic DNA very well. Therefore, MDA could be used to obtain genomic DNA from small precious samples (dozens of spores) for molecular genetic analysis of wheat stripe rust pathogen, and other fungi that are difficult to propagate."

A combination of reference-based assembly using the genome of the previously sequenced American Pgt isolate CDL 75-36-700-3 (p7a) and de novo assembly were performed resulting in a 92 Mbp reference genome for Pgt isolate 21-0. Approximately 13 Mbp of de novo assembled sequence in this genome is not present in the p7a reference assembly. This novel sequence is not specific to 21-0 as it is also present in three other Pgt rust isolates of independent origin. The new reference genome was subsequently used to build a pan-genome based on five Australian Pgt isolates. Transcriptomes from germinated urediniospores and haustoria were separately assembled for pt. 21-0 and comparison of gene expression profiles showed differential expression in ∼10% of the genes each in germinated spores and haustoria. A total of 1,924 secreted proteins were predicted from the 21-0 transcriptome, of which 520 were classified as haustorial secreted proteins (HSPs). Comparison of 21-0 with two presumed clonal field derivatives of this lineage (collected in 1982 and 1984) that had evolved virulence on four additional resistance genes (Sr5, Sr11, Sr27, SrSatu) identified mutations in 25 HSP effector candidates.

"26706318","abstracttext","Cytokinins are plant hormones with biological functions ranging from coordination of plant growth and development to the regulation of senescence. A series of 2-chloro-N(6)-(halogenobenzylamino)purine ribosides was prepared and tested for cytokinin activity in detached wheat leaf senescence, tobacco callus and Amaranthus bioassays. The synthetic compounds showed significant activity, especially in delaying senescence in detached wheat leaves. They were also tested in bacterial receptor bioassays using both monocot and dicot members of the cytokinin receptor family. Most of the derivatives did not trigger cytokinin signaling via the AHK3 and AHK4 receptors from Arabidopsis thaliana in the bacterial assay, but some of them specifically activated the ZmHK1 receptor from Zea mays and were also more active than the aromatic cytokinin BAP in an ARR5::GUS cytokinin bioassay using transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Whole transcript expression analysis was performed using an Arabidopsis model to gather information about the reprogramming of gene transcription when senescent leaves were treated with selected C2-substituted aromatic cytokinin ribosides. Genome-wide expression profiling revealed that the synthetic halogenated derivatives induced the expression of genes related to cytokinin signaling and metabolism. They also prompted both up- and down-regulation of a unique combination of genes coding for components of the photosystem II (PSII) reaction center, light-harvesting complex II (LHCII), and the oxygen-evolving complex, as well as several stress factors responsible for regulating photosynthesis and chlorophyll degradation. Chlorophyll content and fluorescence analyses demonstrated that treatment with the halogenated derivatives increased the efficiency of PSII photochemistry and the abundance of LHCII relative to DMSO- and BAP-treated controls. These findings demonstrate that it is possible to manipulate and fine-tune leaf longevity using synthetic aromatic cytokinin analogs."

Based on morphological characteristics and internal transcribed spacer 1 sequences (ITS1), all the fungi were identified as Neocallimastix frontalis. The co-cultures were confirmed as the one fungus - one methanogen pattern by the PCR-denatured gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) assay. All the methanogens were identified as Methanobrevibacter ruminantium by 16s rRNA gene sequencing. We investigated the biodegrading capacity of the co-culture (N. frontalis + M. ruminantium) Yaktz1 on wheat straw, corn stalk and rice straw in a 7 days-incubation. The in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD), acid detergent fiber digestibility (ADFD) and neural detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD) values of the substrates in the co-culture were significantly higher than those in the mono-culture N. frontalis Yaktz1. The co-culture exhibited high polysaccharide hydrolase (xylanase and FPase) and esterase activities. The xylanase in the co-culture reached the highest activity of 12500 mU/ml on wheat straw at the day 3 of the incubation. At the end of the incubation, 3.00 mmol-3.29 mmol/g dry matter of methane were produced by the co-culture.

Metabolically active bacteria were analyzed through pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and community-level catabolic profiles. Pyrosequencing data showed that levels of Clostridiaceae (Clostridium orbiscindens and Clostridium sp.), Roseburia hominis, and Ruminococcus sp. increased, while levels of other Firmicutes and Fusobacteria decreased, from the HSB samples to the HS fecal samples. Community-level catabolic profiles were lower in HSB samples. Compared to the results for HS samples, cultivable lactobacilli increased in HSB fecal samples, while the numbers of Enterobacteriaceae, total coliforms, and Bacteroides, Porphyromonas, Prevotella, Pseudomonas, Alcaligenes, and Aeromonas bacteria decreased. Metabolome analyses were performed using an amino acid analyzer and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry solid-phase microextraction. A marked increase in short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as 2-methyl-propanoic, acetic, butyric, and propionic acids, was found in HSB samples with respect to the HS fecal samples.

We evaluated the growth and fermentation performance of six natural isolates that were derived from grape wine and medicinal herbs using a wide range of carbon sources, rice and wheat straw hydrolysates as well as stress conditions associated with second-generation ethanol production. Sequence analysis of the 5.8S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and species-specific PCR amplification of the HO gene region assigned the natural isolates to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the mitochondrial DNA revealed that natural yeast isolates are genetically closer to the laboratory strain BY4741 than to the CEN.PK strains. Dextrose fermentation by a natural isolate, MTCC4780, under semi-anaerobic conditions produced maximum ethanol yields of 0.44 g/g and 0.39 g/g, respectively, with and without the stresses encountered during lignocellulosic ethanol fermentation. However, MTCC4780 produced ethanol yields of 0.48 g/g, 0.42 g/g and 0.45 g/g, respectively, with glucose, rice and wheat straw enzymatic hydrolysate fermentation in a bioreactor. The isolates MTCC4781 and MTCC4796 showed higher growth and fermentation performance than did MTCC4780 in the presence of elevated temperature and pre-treatment inhibitors. Taken together, the MTCC4780, MTCC4781 and MTCC4796 strains have the potential to serve as a platform for lignocellulosic ethanol production under stresses associated with second-generation biofuel production."

"26556605","abstracttext_background","Protein ubiquitination is a ubiquitous mechanism in eukaryotes. In Arabidopsis, ubiquitin modification is mainly mediated by two ubiquitin activating enzymes (E1s), 37 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s), and more than 1300 predicted ubiquitin ligase enzymes (E3s), of which ~470 are RING-type E3s. A large proportion of the RING E3's gene products have yet to be characterised in vitro, likely because of the laborious work involved in large-scale cDNA cloning and protein expression, purification, and characterisation. In addition, several E2s, which might be necessary for the activity of certain E3 ligases, cannot be expressed by Escherichia coli or cultured insect cells and, therefore, remain uncharacterised."
"26556605","abstracttext_results","Using the RIKEN Arabidopsis full-length cDNA library (RAFL) with the 'split-primer' PCR method and a wheat germ cell-free system, we established protein libraries of Arabidopsis E2 and RING E3 enzymes. We expressed 35 Arabidopsis E2s including six enzymes that have not been previously expressed, and 204 RING proteins, most of which had not been functionally characterised. Thioester assays using dithiothreitol (DTT) showed DTT-sensitive ubiquitin thioester formation for all E2s expressed. In expression assays of RING proteins, 31 proteins showed high molecular smears, which are probably the result of their functional activity. The activities of another 27 RING proteins were evaluated with AtUBC10 and/or a group of different E2s. All the 27 RING E3s tested showed ubiquitin ligase activity, including 17 RING E3s. Their activities are reported for the first time."
"26556605","abstracttext_conclusion","The wheat germ cell-free system used in our study, which is a eukaryotic expression system and more closely resembles the endogenous expression of plant proteins, is very suitable for expressing Arabidopsis E2s and RING E3s in their functional form. In addition, the protein libraries described here can be used for further understanding E2-E3 specificities and as platforms for protein-protein interaction screening."

"26567901","abstracttext","The diversity of culturable Bacilli was investigated in six wheat cultivating agro-ecological zones of India viz: northern hills, north western plains, north eastern plains, central, peninsular, and southern hills. These agro-ecological regions are based on the climatic conditions such as pH, salinity, drought, and temperature. A total of 395 Bacilli were isolated by heat enrichment and different growth media. Amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis using three restriction enzymes AluI, MspI, and HaeIII led to the clustering of these isolates into 19-27 clusters in the different zones at >70% similarity index, adding up to 137 groups. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing led to the identification of 55 distinct Bacilli that could be grouped in five families, Bacillaceae (68%), Paenibacillaceae (15%), Planococcaceae (8%), Staphylococcaceae (7%), and Bacillales incertae sedis (2%), which included eight genera namely Bacillus, Exiguobacterium, Lysinibacillus, Paenibacillus, Planococcus, Planomicrobium, Sporosarcina, and Staphylococcus. All 395 isolated Bacilli were screened for their plant growth promoting attributes, which included direct-plant growth promoting (solubilization of phosphorus, potassium, and zinc; production of phytohormones; 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity and nitrogen fixation), and indirect-plant growth promotion (antagonistic, production of lytic enzymes, siderophore, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia). To our knowledge, this is the first report for the presence of Bacillus endophyticus, Paenibacillus xylanexedens, Planococcus citreus, Planomicrobium okeanokoites, Sporosarcina sp., and Staphylococcus succinus in wheat rhizosphere and exhibit multifunctional PGP attributes. These niche-specific and multifarious PGP Bacilli may serve as inoculants for crops growing in respective climatic conditions."

"26649867","abstracttext_abstract","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important foliar disease of wheat. Two dominant stripe rust resistant genes YrSM139-1B and YrSM139-2D were pyramided in bread wheat cultivar Shaanmai 139; one from wild emmer and the other from Thinopyrum intermedium. Three near-isogenic F7:8 line pairs (contrasting RILs), N122-1013R/S, N122-185R/S, and N122-1812R/S, independently derived from different F2 plants and differing at the YrSM139-1B locus were generated from the cross Shaanmai 139 × Hu 901-19 through marker-assisted selection. A large F2:3 population from cross N122-1013R × N122-1013S tested for stripe rust response and subjected to analysis with markers in the 1BS10-0.5 bin region using SSR expressed sequence tags (EST) and site-specific sequence markers developed from the 90 K Illumina iSelect SNP array. Five EST-STS markers and four allele-specific PCR markers were mapped to the YrSM139-1B region. The 30.5 cM genetic map for YrSM139-1B consisted of nine markers, two of which were closer to YrSM139-1B than Xgwm273, which was used in producing the contrasting RIL pairs. Race response data and allelism tests showed that YrSM139-1B is different from Yr10, Yr15, and Yr24/26/CH42."

"26626351","abstracttext","The emerging global importance of Korea's alcoholic beverages emphasizes the need for quality enhancement of nuruk, a traditional Korean cereal starter that is used extensively in traditional brewing. Apart from fungi and yeasts, bacteria known to be ubiquitously present are also a part of the nuruk ecosystem and are known to influence fermentation activity by influencing fermentation favorable factors. In the current study, bacterial diversity and temporal variations in the traditional wheat-based nuruk, fermented at two representative temperature conditions for 30 days, along with two commercial wheat-based nuruk samples for comparison analysis were evaluated using libraries of PCR amplicons and 454 pyrosequencing targeting of the hypervariable regions V1 to V3 of the 16S rRNA gene. A total of 90,836 16S reads were analyzed and assigned to a total of 314, 321, and 141 Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for nuruk A, B, and C, respectively. Diversity parameters clearly indicated nuruk B to be more diverse in terms of bacterial composition than nuruk A. Taxonomic assignments indicated that nuruk A was dominated by phylum Cyanobacteria, whereas nuruk B was dominated by phylum Actinobacteria. For both nuruk A and B, members of the phylum Firmicutes mostly converged into the family Bacillaceae; these microorganisms might be present in negligible numbers at the beginning but became significant as the fermentation progressed. The commercial samples were predominated by phylum Firmicutes, which is composed of Lactobacillaceae and Leoconostocaceae. The findings of this study provide new insights into understanding the changes in bacterial community structure during traditional nuruk starter production."

"26267051","abstracttext","Avena sterilis (sterile oat) populations originating from wheat-growing regions of Greece, developed resistance to fenoxaprop, clodinafop and other herbicides. The partial ACCase gene sequence revealed six point mutations (Ile-1781-Leu, Trp-1999-Cys, Trp-2027-Cys, Ile-2041-Asn, Asp-2078-Gly, and Cys-2088-Arg) in 24 out of the 26 resistant (R) populations, confirming the molecular mechanism of resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides. However, DNA sequence of two R populations did not reveal any known ACCase mutations, suggesting possible presence of unknown mutation or metabolism-based mechanism of resistance. The Cys-2088-Arg mutation is the first record for ACCase mutant conferring target-site resistance in A. sterilis worldwide. The evaluation of 12 R and 6 susceptible (S) populations under non-competitive field conditions did not indicate consistent mean growth rate differences, whereas the pot evaluation of the same (12 R and 6 S) populations grown in competition with wheat or in pure stands showed significant growth (fresh weight and panicle number) differences between six S populations and between six R populations containing the same ACCase mutation (Ile-2041-Asn). Finally, one S and five R (Trp-1999-Cys, Trp-2027-Cys, Ile-2041-Asn, Asp-2078-Gly, and Cys-2088-Arg) populations grown under field competitive conditions indicated fresh weight and panicle number differences in competition with other populations as compared with pure stands. These findings suggest clearly that the inconsistent fitness differences between R and S A. sterilis populations are not related with the ACCase resistance trait but they may result from other non-resistance fitness traits selected in their different geographical locations."
"27128793","articletitle","Effect of Dietary Starch Source and Concentration on Equine Fecal Microbiota."
"27128793","abstracttext","Starch from corn is less susceptible to equine small intestinal digestion than starch from oats, and starch that reaches the hindgut can be utilized by the microbiota. The objective of the current study was to examine the effects of starch source on equine fecal microbiota. Thirty horses were assigned to treatments: control (hay only), HC (high corn), HO (high oats), LC (low corn), LO (low oats), and LW (low pelleted wheat middlings). Horses received an all-forage diet (2 wk; d -14 to d -1) before the treatment diets (2 wk; d 1 to 14). Starch was introduced gradually so that horses received 50% of the assigned starch amount (high = 2 g starch/kg BW; low = 1 g starch/kg BW) by d 4 and 100% by d 11. Fecal samples were obtained at the end of the forage-only period (S0; d -2), and on d 6 (S1) and d 13 (S2) of the treatment period. Cellulolytics, lactobacilli, Group D Gram-positive cocci (GPC), lactate-utilizers and amylolytics were enumerated. Enumeration data were log transformed and analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. There were sample day × treatment interactions (P < 0.0001) for all bacteria enumerated. Enumerations from control horses did not change during the sampling period (P > 0.05). All treatments except LO resulted in increased amylolytics and decreased cellulolytics, but the changes were larger in horses fed corn and wheat middlings (P < 0.05). Feeding oats resulted in increased lactobacilli and decreased GPC (P < 0.05), while corn had the opposite effects. LW had increased lactobacilli and GPC (P < 0.05). The predominant amylolytic isolates from HC, LC and LW on S2 were identified by 16S RNA gene sequencing as Enterococcus faecalis, but other species were found in oat fed horses. These results demonstrate that starch source can have a differential effect on the equine fecal microbiota."
"27418359","articletitle","Characterization of three plant biomass-degrading microbial consortia by metagenomics- and metasecretomics-based approaches."
"27418359","abstracttext","The selection of microbes by enrichment on plant biomass has been proposed as an efficient way to develop new strategies for lignocellulose saccharification. Here, we report an in-depth analysis of soil-derived microbial consortia that were trained to degrade once-used wheat straw (WS1-M), switchgrass (SG-M) and corn stover (CS-M) under aerobic and mesophilic conditions. Molecular fingerprintings, bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene amplicon sequencing and metagenomic analyses showed that the three microbial consortia were taxonomically distinct. Based on the taxonomic affiliation of protein-encoding sequences, members of the Bacteroidetes (e.g. Chryseobacterium, Weeksella, Flavobacterium and Sphingobacterium) were preferentially selected on WS1-M, whereas SG-M and CS-M favoured members of the Proteobacteria (e.g. Caulobacter, Brevundimonas, Stenotrophomonas and Xanthomonas). The highest degradation rates of lignin (~59 %) were observed with SG-M, whereas CS-M showed a high consumption of cellulose and hemicellulose. Analyses of the carbohydrate-active enzymes in the three microbial consortia showed the dominance of glycosyl hydrolases (e.g. of families GH3, GH43, GH13, GH10, GH29, GH28, GH16, GH4 and GH92). In addition, proteins of families AA6, AA10 and AA2 were detected. Analysis of secreted protein fractions (metasecretome) for each selected microbial consortium mainly showed the presence of enzymes able to degrade arabinan, arabinoxylan, xylan, β-glucan, galactomannan and rhamnogalacturonan. Notably, these metasecretomes contain enzymes that enable us to produce oligosaccharides directly from wheat straw, sugarcane bagasse and willow. Thus, the underlying microbial consortia constitute valuable resources for the production of enzyme cocktails for the efficient saccharification of plant biomass."
"27148324","articletitle","Heat Priming Induces Trans-generational Tolerance to High Temperature Stress in Wheat."
"27148324","abstracttext","Wheat plants are very sensitive to high temperature stress during grain filling. Effects of heat priming applied to the first generation on tolerance of the successive generation to post-anthesis high temperature stress were investigated. Compared with the progeny of non-heat primed plants (NH), the progeny of heat-primed plants (PH) possessed higher grain yield, leaf photosynthesis and activities of antioxidant enzymes and lower cell membrane damage under high temperature stress. In the transcriptome profile, 1430 probes showed obvious difference in expression between PH and NH. These genes were related to signal transduction, transcription, energy, defense, and protein destination and storage, respectively. The gene encoding the lysine-specific histone demethylase 1 (LSD1) which was involved in histone demethylation related to epigenetic modification was up-regulated in the PH compared with NH. The proteome analysis indicated that the proteins involved in photosynthesis, energy production and protein destination and storage were up-regulated in the PH compared with NH. In short, thermos-tolerance was induced through heritable epigenetic alternation and signaling transduction, both processes further triggered prompt modifications of defense related responses in anti-oxidation, transcription, energy production, and protein destination and storage in the progeny of the primed plants under high temperature stress. It was concluded that trans-generation thermo-tolerance was induced by heat priming in the first generation, and this might be an effective measure to cope with severe high-temperature stresses during key growth stages in wheat production."

"28592942","abstracttext","Rye ( Secale cereale L.) serves as an alternative host of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis ( PTR ) the cause of tan spot on wheat. Rye is cultivated as a forage or cover crop and overlaps with a significant portion of wheat acreage in the U.S. northern Great Plains; however, it is not known whether the rye crop influences the evolution of PTR races. We evaluated a global collection of 211 rye accessions against tan spot and assessed the diversity in PTR population on rye in South Dakota. All the rye genotypes were inoculated with PTR races 1 and 5, and infiltrated with Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB, at seedling stage. We observed 21% of the genotypes exhibited susceptibility to race 1, whereas, 39% were susceptible to race 5. All 211 accessions were insensitive to both the Ptr toxins. It indicates that though rye exhibits diversity in reaction to tan spot, it lacks Ptr ToxA and ToxB sensitivity genes. This suggests that unknown toxins or other factors can lead to PTR establishment in rye. We characterized the race structure of 103 PTR isolates recovered from rye in South Dakota. Only 22% of the isolates amplified Ptr ToxA gene and were identified as race 1 based on their phenotypic reaction on the differential set. The remaining 80 isolates were noted to be race 4. Our results show that races 1 and 4 are prevalent on rye in South Dakota with a higher frequency of race 4, suggesting a minimal role of rye in the disease epidemiology."

"28515785","abstracttext_background","Filamentous fungi are among the most powerful cellulolytic organisms in terrestrial ecosystems. To perform the degradation of lignocellulosic substrates, these microorganisms employ both hydrolytic and oxidative mechanisms that involve the secretion and synergism of a wide variety of enzymes. Interactions between these enzymes occur on the level of saccharification, i.e., the release of neutral and oxidized products, but sometimes also reflected in the substrate liquefaction. Although the synergism regarding the yield of neutral sugars has been extensively studied, further studies should focus on the oxidized sugars, as well as the effect of enzyme combinations on the viscosity properties of the substrates."
"28515785","abstracttext_results","In the present study, the heterologous expression of an endoglucanase (EG) and its combined activity together with a lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase (LPMO), both from the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora thermophila , are described. The EG gene, belonging to the glycoside hydrolase family 5, was functionally expressed in the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris . The produced Mt EG5A (75 kDa) featured remarkable thermal stability and showed high specific activity on microcrystalline cellulose compared to CMC, which is indicative of its processivity properties. The enzyme was capable of releasing high amounts of cellobiose from wheat straw, birch, and spruce biomass. Addition of Mt LPMO9 together with Mt EG5A showed enhanced enzymatic hydrolysis yields against regenerated amorphous cellulose (PASC) by improving the release not only of the neutral but also of the oxidized sugars. Assessment of activity of Mt EG5A on the reduction of viscosity of PASC and pretreated wheat straw using dynamic viscosity measurements revealed that the enzyme is able to perform liquefaction of the model substrate and the natural lignocellulosic material, while when added together with Mt LPMO9, no further synergistic effect was observed."
"28515785","abstracttext_conclusions","The endoglucanase Mt EG5A from the thermophilic fungus M. thermophila exhibited excellent properties that render it a suitable candidate for use in biotechnological applications. Its strong synergism with LPMO was reflected in sugars release, but not in substrate viscosity reduction. Based on the level of oxidative sugar formation, this is the first indication of synergy between LPMO and EG reported."

"28559910","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust is an important disease worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is an effective means to control the disease. In the present study, 244 recombinant inbred lines from Zhou 8425B/Chinese Spring cross were phenotyped for leaf rust severities during the 2011-2012, 2012-2013, 2013-2014, and 2014-2015 cropping seasons at Baoding, Hebei province, and 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 cropping seasons in Zhoukou, Henan province. The population was genotyped using the high-density Illumina iSelect 90K SNP assay and SSR markers. Inclusive composite interval mapping identified eight QTL, designated as QLr.hebau-2AL , QLr.hebau-2BS , QLr.hebau-3A , QLr.hebau-3BS , QLr.hebau-4AL , QLr.hebau-4B , QLr.hebau-5BL, and QLr.hebau-7DS , respectively. QLr.hebau-2BS , QLr.hebau-3A , QLr.hebau-3BS, and QLr.hebau-5BL were derived from Zhou 8425B, whereas the other four were from Chinese Spring. Three stable QTL on chromosomes 2BS, 4B and 7DS explained 7.5-10.6%, 5.5-24.4%, and 11.2-20.9% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. QLr.hebau-2BS in Zhou 8425B might be the same as LrZH22 in Zhoumai 22; QLr.hebau-4B might be the residual resistance of Lr12 , and QLr.hebau-7DS is Lr34 . QLr.hebau-2AL , QLr.hebau-3BS , QLr.hebau-4AL, and QLr.hebau-5BL are likely to be novel QTL for leaf rust. These QTL and their closely linked SNP and SSR markers can be used for fine mapping, candidate gene discovery, and marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding."
"27665284","articletitle","Abiotic stress miRNomes in the Triticeae."
"27665284","abstracttext","The continued growth in world population necessitates increases in both the quantity and quality of agricultural production. Triticeae members, particularly wheat and barley, make an important contribution to world food reserves by providing rich sources of carbohydrate and protein. These crops are grown over diverse production environments that are characterized by a range of environmental or abiotic stresses. Abiotic stresses such as drought, heat, salinity, or nutrient deficiencies and toxicities cause large yield losses resulting in economic and environmental damage. The negative effects of abiotic stresses have increased at an alarming rate in recent years and are predicted to further deteriorate due to climate change, land degradation, and declining water supply. New technologies have provided an important tool with great potential for improving crop tolerance to the abiotic stresses: microRNAs (miRNAs). miRNAs are small regulators of gene expression that act on many different molecular and biochemical processes such as development, environmental adaptation, and stress tolerance. miRNAs can act at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, although post-transcriptional regulation is the most common in plants where miRNAs can inhibit the translation of their mRNA targets via complementary binding and cleavage. To date, expression of several miRNA families such as miR156, miR159, and miR398 has been detected as responsive to environmental conditions to regulate stress-associated molecular mechanisms individually and/or together with their various miRNA partners. Manipulation of these miRNAs and their targets may pave the way to improve crop performance under several abiotic stresses. Here, we summarize the current status of our knowledge on abiotic stress-associated miRNAs in members of the Triticeae tribe, specifically in wheat and barley, and the miRNA-based regulatory mechanisms triggered by stress conditions. Exploration of further miRNA families together with their functions under stress will improve our knowledge and provide opportunities to enhance plant performance to help us meet global food demand."

"27907206","abstracttext","In Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.), and also in other fish species, certain plant protein ingredients can increase fecal water content creating a diarrhea-like condition which may impair gut function and reduce fish growth. The present study aimed to strengthen understanding of the underlying mechanisms by observing effects of various alternative plant protein sources when replacing fish meal on expression of genes encoding proteins playing key roles in regulation of water transport across the mucosa of the distal intestine (DI). A 48-day feeding trial was conducted with five diets: A reference diet (FM) in which fish meal (72%) was the only protein source; Diet SBMWG with a mix of soybean meal (30%) and wheat gluten (22%); Diet SPCPM with a mix of soy protein concentrate (30%) and poultry meal (6%); Diet GMWG with guar meal (30%) and wheat gluten (14.5%); Diet PM with 58% poultry meal. Compared to fish fed the FM reference diet, fish fed the soybean meal containing diet (SBMWG) showed signs of enteritis in the DI, increased fecal water content of DI chyme and higher plasma osmolality. Altered DI expression of a battery of genes encoding aquaporins, ion transporters, tight junction and adherens junction proteins suggested reduced transcellular transport of water as well as a tightening of the junction barrier in fish fed the SBMWG diet, which may explain the observed higher fecal water content and plasma osmolality. DI structure was not altered for fish fed the other experimental diets but alterations in target gene expression and fecal water content were observed, indicating that alterations in water transport components may take place without clear effects on intestinal structure."

"28119711","abstracttext","Wheat is the most important food crop in the world, the unique physiochemical properties of wheat gluten enabling a diverse range of food products to be manufactured. However, genetic and environmental factors affect the technological properties of gluten in unpredictable ways. Although newer proteomic methods have the potential to offer much greater levels of information, it is the older gel-based methods that remain most commonly used to identify compositional differences responsible for the variation in gluten functionality, in part due to the nature of their primary sequences. A combination of platforms were investigated for comprehensive gluten profiling: a QTOF with a data independent schema, which incorporated ion mobility (DIA-IM-MS) and a data dependent acquisition (DDA) workflow using a linear ion trap quadrupole (LTQ) instrument. In conjunction with a manually curated gluten sequence database a total of 2736 gluten peptides were identified with only 157 peptides identified by both platforms. These data showed 127 and 63 gluten protein accessions to be inferred with a minimum of one and three unique peptides respectively. Of the 63 rigorously identified proteins, 26 were gliadin species (4 ω-, 14 α-, and 8 γ-gliadins) and 37 glutenins (including 29 LMW glutenin and 8 HMW glutenins). Of the HMW glutenins, three were 1Dx type and five were 1Bx type illustrating the challenge of unambiguous identification of highly polymorphic proteins without cultivar specific gene sequences. The capacity of the platforms to sequence longer peptides was crucial to achieving the number of identifications, the combination of QTOF-LTQ technology being more important than extraction method to obtain a comprehensive profile. Widespread glutamine deamidation, a post-translational modification, was observed adding complexity to an already highly polymorphic mixture of proteins, with numerous insertions, deletions and substitutions. The data shown is the most comprehensive and detailed proteomic profile of gluten to date."

Shanrong No. 4 (SR4) is an alkalinity tolerant bread wheat cultivar selected from an asymmetric somatic hybridization between the bread wheat cultivar Jinan 177 (JN177) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum), which is a suitable material for studying alkalinity tolerant associate genes."
"28056779","abstracttext_results","The growth of SR4 plant seedlings was less inhibited than that of JN177 when exposed to alkalinity stress conditions. The root cytosolic Na + /K + ratio in alkalinity stressed SR4 was lower than in JN177, while alkalinity stressed SR4 contained higher level of nutrient elements than in JN177. SR4 plant seedlings accumulated less malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), it also showed higher activity of ROS scavenging enzymes than JN177 under alkalinity stress. The root intracellular pH decreased in both alkalinity stressed JN177 and SR4, however, it was much lower in SR4 than in JN177 under alkalinity stress. The transcriptomes of SR4 and JN177 seedlings exposed to alkalinity stress were analyzed by digital gene expression tag profiling method.

"29271300","abstracttext","Barley is a host to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. hordei, and is an intermediate or near nonhost to the formae speciales adapted to wheat (P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) and to barley grass (P. striiformis f. sp. pseudo-hordei). The genetic basis of resistance to these forms of P. striiformis is not well understood. Accordingly, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population was developed using a P. striiformis-susceptible accession (Biosaline-19) and the immune cultivar Pompadour. We investigated the genetic basis of resistance to four diverse P. striiformis isolates (P. striiformis f. sp. pseudo-hordei, and P. striiformis f. sp. tritici pathotypes 104 E137 A-, 134 E16 A+, and 64 E0 A-). and determined that the immunity in Pompadour at the seedling stage to the different P. striiformis isolates was due to quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 1H, 3H, 5H, and 7H with both overlapping and distinct specificities. Further histological analysis confirmed the presence of isolate specificity. The RILs were also assessed in the field for resistance to P. striiformis f. sp. pseudo-hordei, P. striiformis f. sp. hordei, and the leaf rust pathogen (P. hordei) to identify pleiotropic QTL loci effective at the adult plant stage and determine whether the leaf rust resistance in Pompadour (Rph20) was also effective to P. striiformis. RILs that were seedling susceptible to P. striiformis f. sp. pseudo-hordei were resistant in the field, implicating the involvement of adult plant resistance (APR). Additional QTLs were identified on chromosome 7H at the same genetic position as Rph23 (APR to leaf rust), suggesting either pleiotropic resistance or the presence of a stripe rust resistance gene closely linked to or allelic with Rph23. Unlike many pleiotropic APR genes identified and isolated in wheat, our data suggest that the Rph20 locus does not confer resistance to the P. striiformis isolates used in this study (P. striiformis f. sp. hordei [χ 2 (independence) = 2.47 P > 0.12] and P. striiformis f. sp. pseudo-hordei [χ 2 (independence) = 0.42 P > 0.60])."

"29467776","abstracttext","Understanding the genetic bases of economically important traits is fundamentally important in enhancing genetic gains in durum wheat. In this study, a durum panel of 208 lines (comprised of elite materials and exotics from the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center gene bank) were subjected to genome wide association study (GWAS) using 6,211 DArTseq single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The panel was phenotyped under yield potential (YP), drought stress (DT), and heat stress (HT) conditions for 2 years. Mean yield of the panel was reduced by 72% (to 1.64 t/ha) under HT and by 60% (to 2.33 t/ha) under DT, compared to YP (5.79 t/ha). Whereas, the mean yield of the panel under HT was 30% less than under DT. GWAS identified the largest number of significant marker-trait associations on chromosomes 2A and 2B with p -values 10 -06 to 10 -03 and the markers from the whole study explained 7-25% variation in the traits. Common markers were identified for stress tolerance indices: stress susceptibility index, stress tolerance, and stress tolerance index estimated for the traits under DT (82 cM on 2B) and HT (68 and 83 cM on 3B; 25 cM on 7A). GWAS of irrigated (YP and HT combined), stressed (DT and HT combined), combined analysis of three environments (YP + DT + HT), and its comparison with trait per se and stress indices identified QTL hotspots on chromosomes 2A (54-70 cM) and 2B (75-82 cM). This study enhances our knowledge about the molecular markers associated with grain yield and its components under different stress conditions. It identifies several marker-trait associations for further exploration and validation for marker-assisted breeding."

"29451920","abstracttext","Phenazines are bacterial secondary metabolites and play important roles in the antagonistic activity of the biological control strain P. chlororaphis 30-84 against take-all disease of wheat. The expression of the P. chlororaphis 30-84 phenazine biosynthetic operon (phzXYFABCD) is dependent on the PhzR/PhzI quorum sensing system located immediately upstream of the biosynthetic operon as well as other regulatory systems including Gac/Rsm. Bioinformatic analysis of the sequence between the divergently oriented phzR and phzX promoters identified features within the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of phzX that are conserved only among 2OHPCA producing Pseudomonas. The conserved sequence features are potentially capable of producing secondary structures that negatively modulate one or both promoters. Transcriptional and translational fusion assays revealed that deletion of 90-bp of sequence at the 5'-UTR of phzX led to up to 4-fold greater expression of the reporters with the deletion compared to the controls, which indicated this sequence negatively modulates phenazine gene expression both transcriptionally and translationally. This 90-bp sequence was deleted from the P. chlororaphis 30-84 chromosome, resulting in 30-84Enh, which produces significantly more phenazine than the wild-type while retaining quorum sensing control. The transcriptional expression of phzR/phzI and amount of AHL signal produced by 30-84Enh also were significantly greater than for the wild-type, suggesting this 90-bp sequence also negatively affects expression of the quorum sensing genes. In addition, deletion of the 90-bp partially relieved RsmE-mediated translational repression, indicating a role for Gac/RsmE interaction. Compared to the wild-type, enhanced phenazine production by 30-84Enh resulted in improvement in fungal inhibition, biofilm formation, extracellular DNA release and suppression of take-all disease of wheat in soil without negative consequences on growth or rhizosphere persistence. This work provides greater insight into the regulation of phenazine biosynthesis with potential applications for improved biological control."

"28207830","abstracttext","Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) colonization of plant roots causes the down-regulation of expression of phosphate (Pi) or nitrogen (N) transporter genes involved in direct nutrient uptake pathways. The mechanism of this effect remains unknown. In the present study, we sought to determine whether the expression of Pi or N transporter genes in roots of winter wheat colonized by AM fungus responded to (1) Pi or N nutrient signals transferred from the AM extra-radical hyphae, or (2) carbon allocation changes in the AM association. A three-compartment culture system, comprising a root compartment (RC), a root and AM hyphae compartment (RHC), and an AM hyphae compartment (HC), was used to test whether the expression of Pi or N transporter genes responded to nutrients (Pi, NH4+ and NO3-) added only to the HC. Different AM inoculation density treatments (roots were inoculated with 0, 20, 50 and 200 g AM inoculum) and light regime treatments (6 hours light and 18 hours light) were established to test the effects of carbon allocation on the expression of Pi or N transporter genes in wheat roots. The expression of two Pi transporter genes (TaPT4 and TaPHT1.2), five nitrate transporter genes (TaNRT1.1, TaNRT1.2, TaNRT2.1, TaNRT2.2, and TaNRT2.3), and an ammonium transporter gene (TaAMT1.2) was quantified using real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of TaPT4, TaNRT2.2, and TaAMT1.2 was down-regulated by AM colonization only when roots of host plants received Pi or N nutrient signals. However, the expression of TaPHT1.2, TaNRT2.1, and TaNRT2.3 was down-regulated by AM colonization, regardless of whether there was nutrient transfer from AM hyphae. The expression of TaNRT1.2 was also down-regulated by AM colonization even when there was no nutrient transfer from AM hyphae. The present study showed that an increase in carbon consumption by the AM fungi did not necessarily result in greater down-regulation of expression of Pi or N transporter genes."

"28314933","abstracttext_key message","Current development of advanced biotechnology tools allows us to characterize the role of key genes in plant productivity. The implementation of this knowledge in breeding strategies might accelerate the progress in obtaining high-yielding cultivars. The achievements of the Green Revolution were based on a specific plant ideotype, determined by a single gene involved in gibberellin signaling or metabolism. Compared with the 1950s, an enormous increase in our knowledge about the biological basis of plant productivity has opened new avenues for novel breeding strategies. The large and complex genomes of diploid barley and hexaploid wheat represent a great challenge, but they also offer a large reservoir of genes that can be targeted for breeding. We summarize examples of productivity-related genes/mutants in wheat and barley, identified or characterized by means of modern biology. The genes are classified functionally into several groups, including the following: (1) transcription factors, regulating spike development, which mainly affect grain number; (2) genes involved in metabolism or signaling of growth regulators-cytokinins, gibberellins, and brassinosteroids-which control plant architecture and in consequence stem hardiness and grain yield; (3) genes determining cell division and proliferation mainly impacting grain size; (4) floral regulators influencing inflorescence architecture and in consequence seed number; and (5) genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism having an impact on plant architecture and grain yield. The implementation of selected genes in breeding programs is discussed, considering specific genotypes, agronomic and climate conditions, and taking into account that many of the genes are members of multigene families."

"28913578","abstracttext_key message","QTL for tan spot resistance were mapped on wheat chromosomes 1A and 2A. Lines were developed with resistance alleles at these loci and at the tsn1 locus on chromosome 5B. These lines expressed significantly higher resistance than the parent with tsn1 only. Tan spot (syn. yellow spot and yellow leaf spot) caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis is an important foliar disease of wheat in Australia. Few resistance genes have been mapped in Australian germplasm and only one, known as tsn1 located on chromosome 5B, is known in Australian breeding programs. This gene confers insensitivity to the fungal effector ToxA. The main aim of this study was to map novel resistance loci in two populations: Calingiri/Wyalkatchem, which is fixed for the ToxA-insensitivity allele tsn1, and IGW2574/Annuello, which is fixed for the ToxA-sensitivity allele Tsn1. A second aim was to combine new loci with tsn1 to develop lines with improved resistance. Tan spot severity was evaluated at various growth stages and in multiple environments. Symptom severity traits exhibited quantitative variation. The most significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected on chromosomes 2A and 1A. The QTL on 2A explained up to 29.2% of the genotypic variation in the Calingiri/Wyalkatchem population with the resistance allele contributed by Wyalkatchem. The QTL on 1A explained up to 28.1% of the genotypic variation in the IGW2574/Annuello population with the resistance allele contributed by Annuello. The resistance alleles at both QTL were successfully combined with tsn1 to develop lines that express significantly better resistance at both seedling and adult plant stages than Calingiri which has tsn1 only."

"28818587","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in plant growth, development and responses to abiotic stress. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental pollutants. However, it is yet unknown how miRNAs work during PAH uptake by plant roots. Thus, in this study we ascertain phenanthrene (a model PAH)-responsive miRNAs using small RNA high-throughput deep sequencing and their target genes in wheat roots. We identified 108 conserved and non-conserved miRNA members belonging to 82 miRNA families and found 11 differentially expressed miRNAs, among which four miRNAs (miR156, miR164, miR171a and miR9678-3p) were up-regulated and the other seven miRNAs (miR398, miR531, miR1121, miR5048-5p, miR9653b, miR9773 and miR9778) were down-regulated. ABC-transporter-related Gene CA704421 and CA697226 did not respond to phenanthrene exposure. miR156 and miR164 might regulate directly the growth and development of wheat roots by targeting SPL and NAC, respectively. miR398 and miR1121 could regulate oxidative reactions to respond to phenanthrene stress. Additionally, miR9773 might involve phenanthrene metabolism through acting on CYP450. Therefore, it is concluded that phenanthrene triggers variation in miRNA expression, which is associated with uptake of and response to phenanthrene. These findings are of significance for further understanding miRNA regulation mechanisms on PAH uptake, and providing guidance for screening of resistant cultivars in crop production and phytoremediation of PAH-contaminated soils or water at genetic level."

"29693103","abstracttext","In this study, the level of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in wheat bran was increased to be six times higher through the action of endogenous glutamate decarboxylase compared with untreated bran. The process of GABA formation in wheat bran also led to an increased level of phenolic compounds with enhanced antioxidant capacity 2 times higher than the untreated status. The interventional effect of a diet containing GABA-enriched bran on hyperinsulinemia induced by a high-fat diet (HFD) was investigated in a rat model. The results showed that, when compared with animals fed with HFD-containing untreated bran (NB group), the consumption of HFD-containing GABA-enriched bran (GB group) demonstrated a greater improvement of insulin resistance/sensitivity as revealed by the changes in the homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). The expression of hepatic genes, cytochrome P450 family 7 subfamily A member 1 (Cyp7a1) and ubiquitin C (Ubc), which are involved in the adipogenesis-associated PPAR signalling pathway, was found to be significantly down-regulated in the GB group compared with the HFD group (P = 0.0055). Meanwhile, changes in the expression of a number of genes associated with lipid metabolism and gluconeogenesis were also noted in the GB group versus the HFD group, but not in the NB group, indicating different regulatory patterns between the two brans in a high-fat diet. More importantly, the analysis of key genes related to glucose metabolism further revealed that the expression of insulin-induced gene 1/2 (Insig-1/2) was increased following GB intervention with a corresponding reduction in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (Pepck) and glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit (G6pc) expression, suggesting that glucose homeostasis is greatly improved through the intervention of GABA-enriched bran in the context of a high-fat diet."

"29770515","abstracttext","Homology was searched with genes annotated in the Aegilops tauschii pseudomolecules against genes annotated in the pseudomolecules of tetraploid wild emmer wheat, Brachypodium distachyon, sorghum and rice. Similar searches were performed with genes annotated in the rice pseudomolecules. Matrices of collinear genes and rearrangements in their order were constructed. Optical BioNano genome maps were constructed and used to validate rearrangements unique to the wild emmer and Ae. tauschii genomes. Most common rearrangements were short paracentric inversions and short intrachromosomal translocations. Intrachromosomal translocations outnumbered segmental intrachromosomal duplications. The densities of paracentric inversion lengths were approximated by exponential distributions in all six genomes. Densities of collinear genes along the Ae. tauschii chromosomes were highly correlated with meiotic recombination rates but those of rearrangements were not, suggesting different causes of the erosion of gene collinearity and evolution of major chromosome rearrangements. Frequent rearrangements sharing breakpoints suggested that chromosomes have been rearranged recurrently at some sites. The distal 4 Mb of the short arms of rice chromosomes Os11 and Os12 and corresponding regions in the sorghum, B. distachyon and Triticeae genomes contain clusters of interstitial translocations including from 1 to 7 collinear genes. The rates of acquisition of major rearrangements were greater in the large wild emmer wheat and Ae. tauschii genomes than in the lineage preceding their divergence or in the B. distachyon, rice and sorghum lineages. It is suggested that synergy between large quantities of dynamic transposable elements and annual growth habit have been the primary causes of the fast evolution of the Triticeae genomes."

Although HAT genes have been studied in many fungi, few of them have been functionally characterized. In this study, we identified and characterized four putative HATs ( FgGCN5, FgRTT109, FgSAS2, FgSAS3 ) in the plant pathogenic ascomycete Fusarium graminearum , the causal agent of Fusarium head blight of wheat and barley. We replaced the genes and all mutant strains showed reduced growth of F. graminearum . The Δ FgSAS3 and Δ FgGCN5 mutant increased sensitivity to oxidative and osmotic stresses. Additionally, Δ FgSAS3 showed reduced conidia sporulation and perithecium formation. Mutant Δ FgGCN5 was unable to generate any conidia and lost its ability to form perithecia. Our data showed also that FgSAS3 and FgGCN5 are pathogenicity factors required for infecting wheat heads as well as tomato fruits. Importantly, almost no Deoxynivalenol (DON) was produced either in Δ FgSAS3 or Δ FgGCN5 mutants, which was consistent with a significant downregulation of TRI genes expression. Furthermore, we discovered for the first time that FgSAS3 is indispensable for the acetylation of histone site H3K4, while FgGCN5 is essential for the acetylation of H3K9, H3K18, and H3K27. H3K14 can be completely acetylated when FgSAS3 and FgGCN5 were both present. The RNA-seq analyses of the two mutant strains provide insight into their functions in development and metabolism. Results from this study clarify the functional divergence of HATs in F. graminearum , and may provide novel targeted strategies to control secondary metabolite expression and infections of F. graminearum ."

"30808690","abstracttext","Population genetic structure of agricultural pests can be impacted not only by geographic distance and the broader ecological and physical barriers but also by patterns related to where crops are produced and how they are moved after harvest. Stored-product pests, for instance, specialize in exploiting grains such as wheat and rice from on-farm storage through transportation to final processing at often geographically distant locations; therefore human-aided movement may impact their dispersal. Although stored product insects are associated with stored grain, they can also exploit resources in the surrounding environments so different ecological regions where the grain is grown and stored may also influence population structure. Here we used 1,156 SNP markers to investigate how geographic distance, ecological and agricultural variables can impact the genetic structure and gene flow of the stored food pest beetle Rhyzopertha dominica We found a substantial degree of admixture between weakly structured populations in the US. Ecological regions were more important in explaining R. dominica population structure than crop type, suggesting insect movement between wheat and rice grain distribution channels. We have also found a significant correlation between the genetic and geographical distance ( i.e. , isolation by distance). However, our modeling approach combining the ecological and management variables has highlighted the importance of the volume of grain received by a location in the dispersal dynamics of the pest. The first-generation migrant analysis offered additional supported to movement over great distances that are likely associated with grain movement. Our data suggest that a multitude of factors play small but significant parts in the movement dynamics of the pest. The beetles can take advantage of the source-sink dynamic of grain movement in the US, but also engage in a high rate of movement at the local scale. Understanding population structure for R. dominica will provide insights into the potential for local processes of adaptation and broader patterns of movement that will impact management programs and the potential for spread of resistance genes."

"30810762","abstracttext_key message","A major QTL QSpl.nau-7D, named HL2, was validated for its effects on head length and kernel number per spike using NIL, and mapped to a 0.2 cM interval using recombinants. Improvement in wheat inflorescence traits such as spike or head length and spikelet number provides an important avenue to increase grain yield potential. In a previous study, QSpl.nau-7D, the major QTL for head length on chromosome 7D, was identified in the recombinant inbred lines derived from Nanda2419 and Wangshuibai. To validate and precisely map this QTL, the Wangshuibai allele was transferred to elite cultivar Yangmai15 through marker-assisted selection. Compared with the recurrent parent, the resultant near-isogenic line (NIL) yielded not only 28% longer spikes on the average but also more spikelets and kernels per spike. Moreover, the NIL had a lower spikelet density and did not show significant kernel weight change. In the F 2 population derived from the NIL, QSpl.nau-7D acted like a single semi-dominant gene controlling head length and was therefore designated as Head Length 2 (HL2). With this population, a high-density genetic map was constructed mainly using newly developed markers, and 100 homozygous recombinants including 17 genotypes were obtained. Field experiments showed that the recombinants carrying the 0.2-cM interval flanked by Xwgrb1588 and Xwgrb1902 from Wangshuibai produced longer spikes than those without this Wangshuibai allele. Comparative mapping of this interval revealed a conserved synteny among cereal grasses. HL2 is beneficial to wheat breeding for more kernels per spike at a lower spikelet density, which is a favored morphological trait for Fusarium head blight resistance."

Foreground selection with allele-specific PCR-based primer for Pina - D1a (positive selection) was used to identify heterozygous BC 1 F 1 plants. Background selection with 173 polymorphic SSR primers covering all the 21 chromosomes was also carried out, in the foreground-selected BC 1 F 1 plants. BC 1 F 2 plants were selected by ascertaining the presence of Pina - D1a (positive selection) and absence of Pina - D1b (negative selection). Using the approach of positive, negative and background selection with molecular markers, 15 BC 1 F 2 and 31 BC 2 F 1 plants were finally selected. The 15 BC 1 F 2 plants were selfed and the 31 BC 2 F 1 plants were further backcrossed and selfed to raise BC 3 F 1 and BC 2 F 2 progenies, respectively. A part of the BC 2 F 2 seed of each of the 31 plants was analyzed for grain hardness index (GHI) with single-kernel characterization system.

"31083494","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused principally by the species belonging to the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC), is an important disease in wheat, barley, and other small grain crops worldwide. Grain infected with species in the FGSC may be contaminated with trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). In this study, we characterized the phylogenetic relationships, chemotype diversity, phenotypic characters, and aggressiveness of 150 strains in FGSC collected from eight different countries. Phylogenetic analysis based on portions of translation elongation factor 1-α ( EF-1α ) gene from 150 strains revealed six species in the FGSC, F. graminearum s.s , F. asiaticum , F. meridionale , F. cortaderiae , F. boothii, and F. austroamericanum . In this collection, 50% of the strains were 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON), 35% were 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) and 15% were NIV. Evaluation of strains on moderately resistant (MR) wheat cultivar Carberry indicated that there is no significant difference among the species for FHB disease severity (DS), fusarium damaged kernel percentage (FDK%) and DON production. However, significant differences were observed among the chemotypes. Results showed significantly higher FHB DS, FDK%, DON production, growth rates, and macroconidia production for the 3-ADON strains than the 15-ADON and NIV strains. In addition, significant differences for FHB response variables were observed among the strains from different countries. Our results demonstrate that type and amount of trichothecene produced by a strain play a key role in determining the level of aggressiveness of that particular strain, regardless of the species."

"30772538","abstracttext","Tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) is the most effective energy metabolism pathway in higher plants and animals. However, there is no information about its response in plants under environmental stress, especially under polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pollution. Here, this study is the first to discuss the intermediate and related enzyme changes in TCA cycle in plants. We applied high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) proteomics to analyze the intermediate concentration and related protein response in wheat leaf cells, respectively. The concentrations of citrate and malate (0.37 and 0.57 mg kg -1 ) in the treatment with 1.0 mg L -1 phenanthrene were higher than those in the control, and the concentrations of the other five intermediates (i.e., α-ketoglutarate, fumarate, oxaloacetate, pyruvate and succinate) in the treatment were lower than those in the control. Three detected proteins (pyruvate dehydrogenase, dihydrolipoyllysine-residue succinyltransferase and fumarate hydratase) involved in TCA cycle were up-regulated when phenanthrene was accumulated in wheat leaf cells. Meanwhile, real-time PCR results of seven key TCA cycle enzymes genes further confirmed the aforementioned enzyme results. The gene expressions of ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, fumarase and pyruvate dehydrogenase were promoted when phenanthrene was accumulated, while the other four genes were suppressed. In general, pyruvate decrease is the key reason for TCA cycle inactivation under exposure to phenanthrene. Meanwhile, malate concentration increases significantly (P < 0.05), and all the three conversion enzymes turn active. Our results offer helpful information for understanding TCA cycle energy metabolism response to PAH exposure."

"30861768","abstracttext","Sixty-seven isolates of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici collected in Canada were tested for virulence to adult plants of Thatcher near-isogenic wheat lines with leaf rust resistance genes Lr13, Lr22a, Lr34, Lr35, and Lr13 and Lr34 combined. All of the isolates had low infection type to the Thatcher lines with Lr22a and Lr35. All isolates had lower infection type and lower rust severity on the Thatcher line with Lr34 compared with Thatcher. The isolates were polymorphic for virulence to the Thatcher line with Lr13; many isolates were completely virulent to this line, and other isolates produced very low or intermediate avirulent infection type. On the Thatcher line with Lr13 and Lr34 combined, many isolates had infection type and rust severity similar to the Thatcher line with Lr34, while other isolates had lower infection type and rust severity compared with the single-gene lines with Lr13 or Lr34. Fifteen isolates with low, intermediate, and high infection type to adult plants with Lr13 were tested for infection type on seedling plants of the Thatcher lines with resistance genes Lr13, Lr22a, Lr34, Lr35, and Lr37, and on Thatcher lines with Lr13 paired with seedling resistance genes. Most isolates were completely virulent to seedling plants with Lr13 and Lr22a. Plants with Lr37 expressed seedling resistance to all isolates tested. Seedling plants with Lr34 had lower infection types to all isolates compared with Thatcher. Seedlings with Lr35 had high infection types to most isolates, with varying amounts of chlorosis. The Thatcher lines with Lr13 plus seedling resistance genes were most resistant to the isolates that had very low infection types on adult plants with Lr13 and intermediate infection types on plants with seedling resistance genes. Genes Lr22a, Lr35, and Lr37 offer additional sources of highly effective leaf rust resistance in wheat."

"32157475","abstracttext_results","In present study, we show that the treatment of plant roots with N-3-oxo-hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (3OC6-HSL), one molecule of AHLs family, resulted in enhanced salt tolerance in Arabidopsis and wheat. We found that the growth inhibition phenotype including root length, shoot length and fresh weight were significantly improved by 3OC6-HSL under salt stress condition. The physiological and biochemical analysis revealed that the contents of chlorophyll and proline were increased and the contents of MDA and Na + and Na + /K + ratios were decreased after 3OC6-HSL treatment in Arabidopsis and wheat under salt stress condition. Molecular analysis showed that 3OC6-HSL significantly upregulated the expression of salt-responsive genes including ABA-dependent osmotic stress responsive genes COR15a, RD22, ADH and P5CS1, ABA-independent gene ERD1, and ion-homeostasis regulation genes SOS1, SOS2 and SOS3 in Arabidopsis under salt stress condition."

"32131734","abstracttext_backgrounds","The perturbance of chloroplast proteins is a major cause of photosynthesis inhibition under drought stress. The exogenous application of 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) mitigates the damage caused by drought stress, protecting plant growth and development, but the regulatory mechanism behind this process remains obscure."
"32131734","abstracttext_results","Wheat seedlings were drought treated, and the iTRAQ-based proteomic approach was employed to assess the difference in chloroplast protein content caused by exogenous ALA. A total of 9499 peptides, which could be classified into 2442 protein groups, were identified with ≤0.01 FDR. Moreover, the contents of 87 chloroplast proteins was changed by drought stress alone compared to that of the drought-free control, while the contents of 469 was changed by exogenous ALA application under drought stress compared to that of drought stress alone. The Gene Ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis results suggested that the ALA pretreatment adjusted some biological pathways, such as metabolic pathways and pathways involved in photosynthesis and ribosomes, to enhance the drought resistance of chloroplasts. Furthermore, the drought-promoted H 2 O 2 accumulation and O 2 - production in chloroplasts were alleviated by the exogenous pretreatment of ALA, while peroxidase (POD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activities were upregulated, which agreed with the chloroplast proteomic data. We suggested that ALA promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging in chloroplasts by regulating enzymatic processes."

"32133017","abstracttext","Potassium use efficiency, a complex trait, directly impacts the yield potential of crop plants. Low potassium efficiency leads to a high use of fertilizers, which is not only farmer unfriendly but also deteriorates the environment. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are widely used to dissect complex traits. However, most studies use single-locus one-dimensional GWAS models which do not provide true information about complex traits that are controlled by multiple loci. Here, both single-locus GWAS (MLM) and multi-locus GWAS (pLARmEB, FASTmrMLM, mrMLM, FASTmrEMMA) models were used with genotyping from 90 K Infinium SNP array and phenotype derived from four normal and potassium-stress environments, which identified 534 significant marker-trait associations (MTA) for agronomic and potassium related traits: pLARmEB = 279, FASTmrMLM = 213, mrMLM = 35, MLM = 6, FASTmrEMMA = 1. Further screening of these MTA led to the detection of eleven stable loci: q1A, q1D, q2B-1, q2B-2, q2D, q4D, q5B-1, q5B-2, q5B-3, q6D, and q7A . Moreover, Meta-QTL (MQTL) analysis of four independent QTL studies for potassium deficiency in bread wheat located 16 MQTL on 13 chromosomes. One locus identified in this study ( q5B-1 ) colocalized with an MQTL ( MQTL _11 ), while the other ten loci were novel associations. Gene ontology of these loci identified 20 putative candidate genes encoding functional proteins involved in key pathways related to stress tolerance, sugar metabolism, and nutrient transport. These findings provide potential targets for breeding potassium stress resistant wheat cultivars and advocate the advantages of multi-locus GWAS models for studying complex traits."

"32234224","abstracttext","Various abiotic stresses, including high salinity, affect the growth and yield of crop plants. We isolated a gene, TaPUB26, from wheat that encodes a protein containing a U-box domain and armadillo (ARM) repeats. The TaPUB26 transcript levels were upregulated by high salinity, temperature, drought and phytohormones, suggesting the involvement of TaPUB26 in abiotic stress responses. An in vitro ubiquitination assay revealed that TaPUB26 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. We overexpressed TaPUB26 in Brachypodium distachyon to evaluate TaPUB26 regulation of salt stress tolerance. Compared with the wild type (WT) line, the overexpression lines showed higher salt stress sensitivity under salt stress conditions, but lower chlorophyll (Chl) content, lower photosynthetic levels and overall reduced salt stress tolerance. Additionally, the transgenic plants showed more severe membrane damage, lower antioxidant enzyme activity and more reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation than WT plants under salt stress, which might be related to the changes in the expression levels of some antioxidant genes. In addition, the transgenic plants also had higher Na + and lower K + contents, thus maintaining a higher cytosolic Na + /K + ratio in leaves and roots than that in WT plants. Further analysis of the molecular mechanisms showed that TaPUB26 interacted with TaRPT2a, an ATPase subunit of the 26S proteasome complex in wheat. We speculated that TaPUB26 negatively regulates salt stress tolerance by interacting with other proteins, such as TaRPT2a, and that this mechanism involves altered antioxidant competition and cytosolic Na + /K + equilibrium."

"32313551","abstracttext_background","Understanding how fungi degrade lignocellulose is a cornerstone of improving renewables-based biotechnology, in particular for the production of hydrolytic enzymes. Considerable progress has been made in investigating fungal degradation during time-points where CAZyme expression peaks. However, a robust understanding of the fungal survival strategies over its life time on lignocellulose is thereby missed. Here we aimed to uncover the physiological responses of the biotechnological workhorse and enzyme producer Aspergillus niger over its life time to six substrates important for biofuel production."
"32313551","abstracttext_results","We analysed the response of A. niger to the feedstock Miscanthus and compared it with our previous study on wheat straw, alone or in combination with hydrothermal or ionic liquid feedstock pretreatments. Conserved (substrate-independent) metabolic responses as well as those affected by pretreatment and feedstock were identified via multivariate analysis of genome-wide transcriptomics combined with targeted transcript and protein analyses and mapping to a metabolic model. Initial exposure to all substrates increased fatty acid beta-oxidation and lipid metabolism transcripts. In a strain carrying a deletion of the ortholog of the Aspergillus nidulans fatty acid beta-oxidation transcriptional regulator farA, there was a reduction in expression of selected lignocellulose degradative CAZyme-encoding genes suggesting that beta-oxidation contributes to adaptation to lignocellulose. Mannan degradation expression was wheat straw feedstock-dependent and pectin degradation was higher on the untreated substrates. In the later life stages, known and novel secondary metabolite gene clusters were activated, which are of high interest due to their potential to synthesize bioactive compounds."
"32313551","abstracttext_conclusion","In this study, which includes the first transcriptional response of Aspergilli to Miscanthus , we highlighted that life time as well as substrate composition and structure (via variations in pretreatment and feedstock) influence the fungal responses to lignocellulose. We also demonstrated that the fungal response contains physiological stages that are conserved across substrates and are typically found outside of the conditions with high CAZyme expression, as exemplified by the stages that are dominated by lipid and secondary metabolism."

"32388491","abstracttext","The intestinal microbiota plays a critical role in food allergy development. However, little is known regarding the structure and composition of the intestinal microbiota in patients with wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis (WDEIA). We examined the gut microbiota alterations in patients with WDEIA and the microbiota's association with WDEIA. Fecal samples were collected from 25 patients with WDEIA and 25 healthy controls. Environmental exposure factors were obtained, serum total IgE, IgE specific to wheat, gluten, and ω-5 gliadin were measured. Fecal samples were profiled using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The relative abundances of the bacterial genera Blautia (P < 0.05), Erysipelatoclostridium (P < 0.01), Akkermansia (P < 0.05) and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group (P < 0.05) were significantly increased, while those of Lactobacillus (P = 0.001) and Dialister (P < 0.05) were significantly decreased in subjects with WDEIA. The microbial diversity did not differ between WDEIA patients and healthy controls. IgE specific to ω-5 gliadin was positively associated with the Oscillospira (r = 0.48, P < 0.05) and negatively associated with Leuconostoc (r = -0.49, P < 0.05). Total IgE levels were significantly negatively correlated with Bifidobacterium (P < 0.05). The gut microbiome compositions in WDEIA patients differed from those of healthy controls.

"32656603","abstracttext","High-quality environmentally-friendly bioplastics can be produced by mixing poly-L-lactate with poly-D-lactate. On an industrial scale, this process simultaneously consumes large amounts of both optically pure lactate stereoisomers. However, because optimal growth conditions of L-lactate producers often differ from those of D-lactate producers, each stereoisomer is produced in a specialised facility, which raises cost and lowers sustainability. To address this challenge, we metabolically engineered Lactobacillus gasseri JCM 1131 T , a bioprocess-friendly and genetically malleable strain of homofermentative lactic acid bacterium, to efficiently produce either pure L- or pure D-lactate under the same bioprocess conditions. Transformation of L. gasseri with plasmids carrying additional genes for L- or D-lactate dehydrogenases failed to affect the ratio of produced stereoisomers, but inactivation of the endogenous genes created strains which yielded 0.96 g of either L- or D-lactate per gram of glucose. In this study, the plasmid pHBintE, routinely used for gene disruption in Bacillus megaterium, was used for the first time to inactivate genes in lactobacilli. Strains with inactivated genes for endogenous lactate dehydrogenases efficiently fermented sugars released by enzymatic hydrolysis of alkali pre-treated wheat straw, an abundant lignocellulose-containing raw material, producing 0.37-0.42 g of lactate per gram of solid part of alkali-treated wheat straw. Thus, the constructed strains are primed to serve as producers of both optically pure L-lactate and D-lactate in the next-generation biorefineries."

"32573086","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is one of the most destructive plant pathogens worldwide, causing fusarium head blight (FHB) on cereals. F. graminearum colonizes wheat plant surfaces with specialized unbranched hyphae called runner hyphae (RH), which develop multicelled complex appressoria called infection cushions (IC). IC generate multiple penetration sites, allowing the fungus to enter the plant cuticle. Complex infection structures are typical for several economically important plant pathogens, yet with unknown molecular basis. In this study, RH and IC formed on the surface of wheat paleae were isolated by laser capture microdissection. RNA-Seq-based transcriptomic analyses were performed on RH and IC and compared to mycelium grown in complete medium (MY). Both RH and IC displayed a high number of infection up-regulated genes (982), encoding, among others, carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes: 140), putative effectors (PE: 88), or secondary metabolism gene clusters (SMC: 12 of 67 clusters). RH specifically up-regulated one SMC corresponding to aurofusarin biosynthesis, a broad activity antibiotic. IC specifically up-regulated 248 genes encoding mostly putative virulence factors such as 7 SMC, including the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol and the newly identified fusaoctaxin A, 33 PE, and 42 CAZymes. Furthermore, we studied selected candidate virulence factors using cellular biology and reverse genetics. Hence, our results demonstrate that IC accumulate an arsenal of proven and putative virulence factors to facilitate the invasion of epidermal cells."

"32504212","abstracttext","We utilized 2300 wheat accessions including worldwide landraces, cultivars and primary synthetic-derived germplasm with three Australian cultivars: Annuello, Yitpi and Correll, to investigate field-based resistance to leaf (Lr) rust, stem (Sr) rust and stripe (Yr) rust diseases across a range of Australian wheat agri-production zones. Generally, the resistance in the modern Australian cultivars, synthetic derivatives, South and North American materials outperformed other geographical subpopulations. Different environments for each trait showed significant correlations, with average r values of 0.53, 0.23 and 0.66 for Lr, Sr and Yr, respectively. Single-trait genome-wide association studies (GWAS) revealed several environment-specific and multi-environment quantitative trait loci (QTL). Multi-trait GWAS confirmed a cluster of Yr QTL on chromosome 3B within a 4.4-cM region. Linkage disequilibrium and comparative mapping showed that at least three Yr QTL exist within the 3B cluster including the durable rust resistance gene Yr30. An Sr/Lr QTL on chromosome 3D was found mainly in the synthetic-derived germplasm from Annuello background which is known to carry the Agropyron elongatum 3D translocation involving the Sr24/Lr24 resistance locus. Interestingly, estimating the SNP effects using a BayesR method showed that the correlation among the highest 1% of QTL effects across environments (excluding GWAS QTL) had significant correlations, with average r values of 0.26, 0.16 and 0.55 for Lr, Sr and Yr, respectively. These results indicate the importance of small effect QTL in achieving durable rust resistance which can be captured using genomic selection."

"32431686","abstracttext","Fusarium asiaticum is one of the pivotal members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC) causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) on wheat, barley and rice in large parts of Asia. Besides resulting in yield losses, FHB also causes the accumulation of mycotoxins such as nivalenol (NIV) and deoxynivalenol (DON). The aim of this study was to conduct population studies on F. asiaticum from Southern China through mitochondrial genome analyses. All strains were isolated from wheat or rice from several geographic areas in seven provinces in Southern China. Based on geographic location and host, 210 isolates were selected for next generation sequencing, and their mitogenomes were assembled by GRAbB and annotated to explore the mitochondrial genome variability of F. asiaticum . The F. asiaticum mitogenome proves extremely conserved and variation is mainly caused by absence/presence of introns harboring homing endonuclease genes. These variations could be utilized to develop molecular markers for track and trace of migrations within and between populations. This study illustrates how mitochondrial introns can be used as markers for population genetic analysis. SNP analysis demonstrate the occurrence of mitochondrial recombination in F. asiaticum as was previously found for F. oxysporum and implied for F. graminearum . Furthermore, varying degrees of genetic diversity and recombination showed a high association with different geographic regions as well as with cropping systems. The mitogenome of F. graminearum showed a much higher SNP diversity while the interspecies intron variation showed no evidence of gene flow between the two closely related and sexual compatible species."

"32438769","abstracttext","As the diploid progenitor of common wheat, Aegilops tauschii is considered to be a valuable resistance source to various biotic and abiotic stresses. However, little has been reported concerning the molecular mechanism of drought tolerance in Ae. tauschii . In this work, the drought tolerance of 155 Ae. tauschii accessions was firstly screened on the basis of their coleoptile lengths under simulated drought stress. Subsequently, two accessions (XJ002 and XJ098) with contrasting coleoptile lengths were selected and intensively analyzed on rate of water loss (RWL) as well as physiological characters, confirming the difference in drought tolerance at the seedling stage. Further, RNA-seq was utilized for global transcriptome profiling of the two accessions seedling leaves under drought stress conditions. A total of 6969 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with drought tolerance were identified, and their functional annotations demonstrated that the stress response was mediated by pathways involving alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, starch and sucrose metabolism, peroxisome, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. In addition, DEGs with obvious differences between the two accessions were intensively analyzed, indicating that the expression level of DEGs was basically in alignment with the physiological changes of Ae. tauschii under drought stress. The results not only shed fundamental light on the regulatory process of drought tolerance in Ae. tauschii , but also provide a new gene resource for improving the drought tolerance of common wheat."

"32480564","abstracttext","In recent years, the interest in new technologies for wheat improvement has increased greatly. To screen genetically modified germplasm in conditions more realistic for a field situation we developed a phenotyping platform where transgenic wheat and barley are grown in competition. In this study, we used the platform to (1) test selected promoter and gene combinations for their capacity to increase drought tolerance, (2) test the function and power of our platform to screen the performance of transgenic plants growing in competition, and (3) develop and test an imaging and analysis process as a means of obtaining additional, non-destructive data on plant growth throughout the whole growth cycle instead of relying solely on destructive sampling at the end of the season. The results showed that several transgenic lines under well watered conditions had higher biomass and/or grain weight than the wild-type control but the advantage was significant in one case only. None of the transgenics seemed to show any grain weight advantage under drought stress and only two lines had a substantially but not significantly higher biomass weight than the wild type. However, their evaluation under drought stress was disadvantaged by their delayed flowering date, which increased the drought stress they experienced in comparison to the wild type. Continuous imaging during the season provided additional and non-destructive phenotyping information on the canopy development of mini-plots in our phenotyping platform. A correlation analysis of daily canopy coverage data with harvest metrics showed that the best predictive value from canopy coverage data for harvest metrics was achieved with observations from around heading/flowering to early ripening whereas early season observations had only a limited diagnostic value. The result that the biomass/leaf development in the early growth phase has little correlation with biomass or grain yield data questions imaging approaches concentrating only on the early development stage."

"30081325","abstracttext","The ability of roots to grow under drought stress is an adaptive trait for crop plants especially under rain fed and restricted irrigation regime. To unravel the molecular mechanism of drought induced-root growth, root transcriptomes of two wheat genotypes viz. Raj3765 and HD2329, with contrasting root growth under drought stress were analyzed. Drought stress significantly enhanced total root length in Raj3765 as compared to that of HD2329. RNA-seq analysis led to the identification of 2783 and 2638 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in Raj3765 and HD2329, respectively, under drought stress as compared with non-stress conditions. Functional annotation, gene ontology and MapMan analysis of the DEGs revealed differential regulation of genes for pathways associated with root growth and stress tolerance. Drought stress significantly upregulated auxin receptor (AFB2) and ABA responsive transcription factors (MYB78, WRKY18 and GBF3) in roots of Raj3765. Although certain genes for ethylene pathway were downregulated in both the genotypes, ACC oxidase and 2OG-Fe(II) oxygenase were upregulated only in Raj3765 which might contribute to maintenance of a basal ethylene level to maintain root growth. Several genes related to cell wall biosynthesis and ROS metabolism were significantly upregulated in Raj3765. Genes related to gibberellic acid, jasmonic acid and phenylpropanoid pathways were downregulated in roots of both the genotypes under drought stress. Our analysis suggests that a coordinated yet complex interplay between hormones, cellular tolerance, cell wall synthesis and ROS metabolism are required for drought induced root growth in wheat."

"30265666","abstracttext","Multilayered defense responses ensure that plants are hosts to only a few adapted pathogens in the environment. The host range of a plant pathogen depends on its ability to fully overcome plant defense barriers, with failure at any single step sufficient to prevent life cycle completion of the pathogen. Puccinia striiformis, the causal agent of stripe rust (=yellow rust), is an agronomically important obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen of wheat and barley. It is generally unable to complete its life cycle on the non-adapted wild grass species Brachypodium distachyon, but natural variation exists for the degree of hyphal colonization by Puccinia striiformis. Using three B. distachyon mapping populations, we identified genetic loci conferring colonization resistance to wheat-adapted and barley-adapted isolates of P. striiformis. We observed a genetic architecture composed of two major effect QTLs (Yrr1 and Yrr3) restricting the colonization of P. striiformis. Isolate specificity was observed for Yrr1, whereas Yrr3 was effective against all tested P. striiformis isolates. Plant immune receptors of the nucleotide binding, leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) encoding gene family are present at the Yrr3 locus, whereas genes of this family were not identified at the Yrr1 locus. While it has been proposed that resistance to adapted and non-adapted pathogens are inherently different, the observation of (1) a simple genetic architecture of colonization resistance, (2) isolate specificity of major and minor effect QTLs, and (3) NB-LRR encoding genes at the Yrr3 locus suggest that factors associated with resistance to adapted pathogens are also critical for non-adapted pathogens."

"30151724","abstracttext","Two hundred one hexaploid wheat accessions, representing 200 years of selection and breeding history, were sampled from the National Small Grains Collection in Aberdeen, ID, and evaluated for five root traits at the seedling stage. A paper roll-supported hydroponic system was used for seedling growth. Replicated roots samples were analyzed by WinRHIZO. We observed accessions with nearly no branching and accessions with up to 132 cm of branching. Total seminal root length ranged from 70 to 248 cm, a 3.5-fold difference. Next-generation sequencing was used to produce single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and genomic libraries that were aligned to the wheat reference genome IWGSCv1 and were called single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. After filtering and imputation, a total of 20,881 polymorphic sites were used to perform association mapping in TASSEL. Gene annotations were conducted for identified marker-trait associations (MTAs) with - log 10 P > 3.5 (p value < 0.003). In total, we identified 63 MTAs with seven for seminal axis root length (SAR), 24 for branching (BR), four for total seminal root length (TSR), eight for root dry matter (RDM), and 20 for root diameter (RD). Putative proteins of interest that we identified include chalcone synthase, aquaporin, and chymotrypsin inhibitor for SAR, MYB transcription factor and peroxidase for BR, zinc fingers and amino acid transporters for RDM, and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase for RD. We evaluated the effects of height-reducing Rht alleles and the 1B/1R translocation event on root traits and found presence of the Rht-B1b allele decreased RDM, while presence of the Rht-D1b allele increased TSR and decreased RD."

"30154817","abstracttext","Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been widely used to dissect the complex biosynthetic processes of plant metabolome. Most studies have used single-locus GWAS approaches, such as mixed linear model (MLM), and little is known about more efficient algorithms to implement multi-locus GWAS. Here, we report a comprehensive GWAS of 20 free amino acid (FAA) levels in kernels of bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) based on 14,646 SNPs by six multi-locus models (FASTmrEMMA, FASTmrMLM, ISISEM-BLASSO, mrMLM, pKWmEB, and pLARmEB). Our results showed that 328 significant quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) were identified in total (38, 8, 92, 45, 117, and 28, respectively, for the above six models). Among them, 66 were repeatedly detected by more than two models, and 155 QTNs appeared only in one model, indicating the reliability and complementarity of these models. We also found that the number of significant QTNs for different FAAs varied from 8 to 41, which revealed the complexity of the genetic regulation of metabolism, and further demonstrated the necessity of the multi-locus GWAS. Around these significant QTNs, 15 candidate genes were found to be involved in FAA biosynthesis, and one candidate gene ( TraesCS1D01G052500 , annotated as tryptophan decarboxylase) was functionally identified to influence the content of tryptamine in vitro . Our study demonstrated the power and efficiency of multi-locus GWAS models in crop metabolome research and provided new insights into understanding FAA biosynthesis in wheat."

"30158124","abstracttext","Long terminal repeat-retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) are a major component of all flowering plant genomes. To analyze the time dynamics of LTR-RTs, we modeled the insertion rates of the 35 most abundant LTR-RT families in the genome of Aegilops tauschii , one of the progenitors of wheat. Our model of insertion rate (birth) takes into account random variation in LTR divergence and the deletion rate (death) of LTR-RTs. Modeling the death rate is crucial because ignoring it would underestimate insertion rates in the distant past. We rejected the hypothesis of constancy of insertion rates for all 35 families and showed by simulations that our hypothesis test controlled the false-positive rate. LTR-RT insertions peaked from 0.064 to 2.39 MYA across the 35 families. Among other effects, the average age of elements within a family was negatively associated with recombination rate along a chromosome, with proximity to the closest gene, and weakly associated with the proximity to its 5' end. Elements within a family that were near genes colinear with genes in the genome of tetraploid emmer wheat tended to be younger than those near noncolinear genes. We discuss these associations in the context of genome evolution and stability of genome sizes in the tribe Triticeae. We demonstrate the general utility of our models by analyzing the two most abundant LTR-RT families in Arabidopsis lyrata , and show that these families differed in their insertion dynamics. Our estimation methods are available in the R package TE on CRAN."
"30798173","articletitle","Role of polyamines in plant growth regulation of Rht wheat mutants."
"30798173","abstracttext","Besides their protective role, polyamines also serve as signalling molecules. However, further studies are needed to elucidate the polyamine signalling pathways, especially to identify polyamine-regulated mechanisms and their connections with other regulatory molecules. Reduced height (Rht) genes in wheat are often used in breeding programs to increase harvest index. Some of these genes are encoding DELLA proteins playing role in gibberellic acid signalling. The aim of the present paper was to reveal how the mutations in Rht gene modify the polyamine-regulated processes in wheat. Wild type and two Rht mutant genotypes (Rht 1: semi-dwarf; Rht 3: dwarf mutants) were treated with polyamines. Polyamine treatments differently influenced the polyamine metabolism, the plant growth parameters and certain hormone levels (salicylic acid and abscisic acid) in these genotypes. The observed distinct metabolism of Rht 3 may more likely reflect more intensive polyamine exodus from putrescine to spermidine and spermine, and the catabolism of the higher polyamines. The lower root to shoot translocation of putrescine can contribute to the regulation of polyamine pool, which in turn may be responsible for the observed lack of growth inhibition in Rht 3 after spermidine and spermine treatments. Lower accumulation of salicylic acid and abscisic acid, plant hormones usually linked with growth inhibition, in leaves may also be responsible for the diminished negative effect of higher polyamines on the shoot growth parameters observed in Rht 3. These results provide an insight into the role of polyamines in plant growth regulation based on the investigation of gibberellin-insensitive Rht mutants."

In May 2017, a suspected resistant P. fugax population AHHY that survived fenoxaprop-P-ethyl applied at its field-recommended rate was collected from a wheat field in Huaiyuan County, Anhui Province, China. This study aimed to determine the resistance profile of AHHY to acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) inhibitors and to investigate its mechanisms of resistance to fenoxaprop."
"30950550","abstracttext_results","Single-dose testing indicated that the AHHY population had evolved resistance to fenoxaprop. The partial carboxyltransferase domain of ACCase in P. fugax was amplified and compared. Four loci encoding plastidic ACCase were isolated from both the resistant and sensitive individuals. Combining gene sequencing with the derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence assay, we found that 100% of the plants of AHHY carried Trp-1999-Ser mutation in their ACCase1,1-2 allele. Whole-plant dose-response bioassay indicated that AHHY was highly resistant to fenoxaprop and pinoxaden (resistance index (RI) ≥ 10) with low resistance to clodinafop-propargyl, sethoxydim, and clethodim (2 ≤ RI < 5). Pre-treatment with piperonyl butoxide largely reduced (55%) the weed's resistance to fenoxaprop. Both basal and fenoxaprop-induced glutathione S-transferases activities toward 1-chloro-2, 4-dinitrobenzene were significantly higher in resistant plants than in susceptible plants."

"30953278","abstracttext_key message","Our results reveal both soil drought and PEG can enhance malate, glutathione and ascorbate metabolism, and proline biosynthesis, whereas soil drought induced these metabolic pathways to a greater degree than PEG. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) is widely used to simulate osmotic stress, but little is known about the different responses of wheat to PEG stress and soil drought. In this study, isobaric tags for relative quantification (iTRAQ)-based proteomic techniques were used to determine both the proteomic and physiological responses of wheat seedlings to soil drought and PEG. The results showed that photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO 2 concentration, transpiration rate, maximum potential efficiency of PS II, leaf water content, relative electrolyte leakage, MDA content, and free proline content exhibited similar responses to soil drought and PEG. Approximately 15.8% of differential proteins were induced both by soil drought and PEG. Moreover, both soil drought and PEG inhibited carbon metabolism and the biosynthesis of some amino acids by altering the accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, and phosphoglycerate kinase, but they both enhanced the metabolism of malate, proline, glutathione, and ascorbate by increasing the accumulation of key enzymes including malate dehydrogenase, monodehydroascorbate reductase, pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase, pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthetase, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase. Notably, the latter five of these enzymes were found to be more sensitive to soil drought. In addition, polyamine biosynthesis was specifically induced by increased gene expression and protein accumulation of polyamine oxidase and spermidine synthase under PEG stress, whereas fructose-bisphosphate aldolase and arginase were induced by soil drought. Therefore, present results suggest that PEG is an effective method to simulate drought stress, but the key proteins related to the metabolism of malate, glutathione, ascorbate, proline, and polyamine need to be confirmed under soil drought."

"30727155","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is an important disease of wheat and barley worldwide. The disease is primarily caused by members of the Fusarium graminearum species complex, consisting of at least 14 phylogenetically distinct species. To determine the population structure of the FHB pathogens in a naturally infected disease nursery located at Jianyang, Fujian province, China, 160 isolates of the F. graminearum complex were recovered from symptomatic wheat spike samples collected in two consecutive years (2008 and 2009) and characterized using species- and chemotype-specific polymerase chain reaction as well as variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) markers. All isolates analyzed were identified as F. asiaticum except for one isolate, which was identified as F. avenaceum. Among the 159 F. asiaticum isolates, 126 (79%) isolates were of the nivalenol (NIV) type while 29 (18%) isolates were of the 15-acetyl deoxynivalenol type and only 4 (3%) isolates were of the 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol type. The 10 VNTR markers revealed 124 distinct haplotypes and 76 polymorphic alleles across the whole population. The two subpopulations (FA-08 and FA-09) grouped based on the year of collection exhibited low genetic differentiation (F st = 0.032) and high gene flow (N m = 15.13). However, a significant genetic differentiation was found within the NIV-type isolates as revealed by the Structure software. The pairwise linkage disequilibrium tests did not support the hypothesis of random mating in the population because half (48.8%) of the locus pairs showed a linkage disequilibrium (P > 0.05). Our results suggest that FHB in this nursery was caused by a genetically homogenous and non-random mating population of F. asiaticum in 2008 and 2009, which consisted of all three trichothecene types with various levels of aggressiveness."

"30680113","abstracttext","Many filamentous plant pathogens exhibit high levels of genomic variability, yet the impact of this variation on host-pathogen interactions is largely unknown. We have addressed host specialization in the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici . Our study builds on comparative analyses of infection and gene expression phenotypes of three isolates and reveals the extent to which genomic variation translates into phenotypic variation. The isolates exhibit genetic and genomic variation but are similarly virulent. By combining confocal microscopy, disease monitoring, staining of ROS, and comparative transcriptome analyses, we conducted a detailed comparison of the infection processes of these isolates in a susceptible wheat cultivar. We characterized four core infection stages: establishment, biotrophic growth, lifestyle transition, and necrotrophic growth and asexual reproduction that are shared by the three isolates. However, we demonstrate differentiated temporal and spatial infection development and significant differences in the expression profiles of the three isolates during the infection stages. More than 20% of the genes were differentially expressed and these genes were located significantly closer to transposable elements, suggesting an impact of epigenetic regulation. Further, differentially expressed genes were enriched in effector candidates suggesting that isolate-specific strategies for manipulating host defenses are present in Z. tritici . We demonstrate that individuals of a host-specialized pathogen have highly differentiated infection programs characterized by flexible infection development and functional redundancy. This illustrates how high genetic diversity in pathogen populations results in highly differentiated infection phenotypes, which fact needs to be acknowledged to understand host-pathogen interactions and pathogen evolution."

"30680420","abstracttext_key message","A major, likely novel stripe rust resistance QTL for all-stage resistance on chromosome arm 1BL identified in a 1.76-cM interval using a saturated linkage map was validated in four populations with different genetic backgrounds. Stripe rust is a globally important disease of wheat. Identification and utilization of new resistance genes are essential for breeding resistant cultivars. Wheat line 20828 has exhibited high levels of stripe rust resistance for over a decade. However, the genetics of stripe rust resistance in this line has not been studied. A set of 199 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from a cross between 20828 and a susceptible cultivar Chuannong 16. The RIL population was genotyped with the Wheat55K SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) array and SSR (simple sequence repeat) markers and evaluated in four environments with current predominant Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici t races including CYR32, CYR33 and CYR34. Four stable QTL were located on chromosomes 1B (2 QTL), 4A and 6A. Among them, the major QTL, QYr.sicau-1B.1 (LOD = 23-28, PVE = 16-39%), was localized to a 1.76-cM interval flanked by SSR markers Xwmc216 and Xwmc156 on chromosome 1BL. Eight resistance genes were previously identified in the physical interval of QYr.sicau-1B.1. Compared with previous studies, QYr.sicau-1B.1 is a new gene for resistant to stripe rust. It was further verified by analysis of the closely linked SSR markers Xwmc216 and Xwmc156 in four other populations with different genetic backgrounds. QYr.sicau-1B.1 reduced the stripe rust disease index by up to 82.8%. Three minor stable QTL (located on chromosomes 1B, 4A and 6A, respectively) also added to the resistance level of QYr.sicau-1B.1. Our results provide valuable information for further fine mapping and cloning as well as molecular-assisted breeding with QYr.sicau-1B.1."

Principal coordinates analysis indicated that fertilization management affected fungal community structure and aggregation distribution. In addition, CS increased fungal community richness and diversity, compared to CK, CB decreased these aspects. Ascomycota, unclassified_k_Fungi, and Basidiomycota were the dominant phyla in all soil samples.

"30554374","abstracttext","Seed priming with iron (Fe) and/or zinc (Zn) can overcome the reduced availability of these micronutrients in soils and crops, but suitable dosages should be predetermined. Nucleolus responds to stress, such as cytotoxicity, with alterations perceivable by cytogenetic analyses. This work intends to study how seed priming with Fe and/or Zn affects the nucleolar activity in roots and the total soluble protein content in the flour of bread wheat cv. 'Jordão'. Seven priming treatments with 0 mg L -1 to 8 mg L -1 of Fe and/or Zn were performed. In all treatments, each metaphase cell presented a maximum of six nucleolar organizer regions positively stained with silver nitrate (Ag-NORs). Also, a maximum number of six nucleoli per nucleus were observed in all treatments, except in the hydroprimed seeds (used as control) that showed a maximum of five nucleoli, probably due to nucleolar fusion. Irregular interphases were frequent in treatments with the highest dosage of micronutrients (8 mg L -1 Fe and/or 8 mg L -1 Zn). The nucleolar area reduced (p < 0.001) as the number of nucleoli increased, and it was lower in treatments with a combination of Fe and Zn. However, the combinations of Fe and Zn showed the highest concentrations of total soluble protein (p ≤ 0.001). Although a reduced nucleolar area represents low ribosomal RNA gene transcription and ribosomal production, the significant increase of the number of nucleoli in the seeds primed with Fe and Zn enhanced the total soluble protein content as compared to the hydroprimed seeds (control) probably due to an increase of nucleolar surface-to-volume ratio that improved the protein synthesis. Overall, this work revealed that priming of bread wheat seeds with suited dosages of Fe and Zn can improve the nutritional value of flour, and the nucleolar number, morphology, and area can be useful biomarkers in cytotoxicity studies."

Mature compost demonstrated high quality with total nitrogen, pH, and C/N ratio of 2.0%, 7.5, and 18:1 respectively, which was suitable for mushroom mycelia growth. During composting, 47-50% of cellulose, 63-65% of hemicellulose, and 8-17% lignin were degraded, while 22-27% of cellulose, 14-16% of hemicellulose, and 15-21% of lignin were consumed by A. bisporus mycelia during cultivation. The highest FPUase and CMCase were observed during mushroom flushes. Endo-xylanase had the key role in hemicellulose degradation with high enzyme activity during cultivation stages. Laccase participated in lignin degradation with the highest enzyme activity in Pinning stage followed by a sharp decline at the first flush. Yield was up to 20 kg/m 2 , as this is similar to growth on wheat straw, this shows that millet straw is an effective resource for mushroom cultivation. Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Deinococcus-Thermus, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria were the dominant phyla, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing during composting. The key environmental factors dominating bacterial communities of the samples were determined to be pH value, cellulose content, and hemicellulose content for prewetting and premixed phase of basic mixture (P0); moisture content for phase I (PI); and nitrogen content, lignin content, and ash content for phase II (PII), respectively."

"30686229","abstracttext","Screening for adult plant resistance in wheat to stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is generally conducted in field plots. Although such evaluations are successful if managed properly, field ratings are time consuming, expensive, weather dependent, and open to inoculum of unwanted races or other confounding diseases. The objective of this study was to develop a dependable system of screening the response of adult plants to stem rust under greenhouse conditions. A comparison of inoculation methods and incubation environments showed that plants inoculated with urediniospores suspended in water, followed by a 24 h dew period in a plastic chamber constructed in a greenhouse, gave the most consistent results. Measurements of response type, stem rust severity, and frequency in follow-up experiments indicated that the most reliable infection was obtained when plants sprayed with 1.25 mg urediniospores per ml water were incubated in the plastic chamber. Using the optimized protocol, a Kariega × Avocet S doubled haploid population was inoculated with two P. graminis f. sp. tritici races. Depending on the race, composite interval mapping showed flag leaf infection type to be significantly influenced by regions on chromosomes 6A, 6D, and 7D. Stem rust severity and reaction type mapped to chromosomes 6D and/or 6A. The Lr34/Yr18/Sr57 gene derived from Kariega on chromosome 7D affected the rust response on flag leaves but not on stems of greenhouse-grown plants. This study showed that phenotyping and genetic analysis of especially major effect stem rust resistance in adult wheat plants is possible and reproducible under controlled conditions in a greenhouse."

"30699377","abstracttext","While biochar on metal immobilization was well understood, a small pool of dissolvable organic matter (DOM) from biochar was recently recognized as a bioactive agent for plant growth promotion. However, how the molecular composition and plant effects of this fraction and the performance for metal immobilization of the DOM-removed biochar could vary with pyrolysis temperature had been not well addressed. In this study, wheat straw biochar pyrolyzed at a temperature of 350 °C, 450 °C, 550 °C were extracted with hot water to separate the DOM fraction. The obtained biochar extracts (BE350, BE450, and BE550) were tested as foliar amendment to Chinese cabbage while the extracted (DOM-removed) biochars were tested for heavy metal immobilization in a contaminated soil. The results showed that BE350 was higher in organic matter content, abundance of organic molecules and mineral nutrients than BE450 and BE550. Compared to control, foliar application of BE350 significantly enhanced the shoot biomass (by 89%), increased leaf soluble sugar content (by 83%) but reduced leaf content of nitrate (by 34%) and of potential toxic metals (by 49% for Cd and by 30% for Pb). Moreover, BE350 treatment increased gene expression of nitrate reductase and glutamine synthetase enzyme activity of the tested plant. Meanwhile, soil amendment of DOM-extracted biochars significantly decreased soil CaCl 2 extractable pool of Cd, Pb, Cu and Zn in a range of 27%-78%. Thus, the performance of DOM extract of biochar on plant growth promotion was indeed dependent of pyrolysis temperature, being greater at 350 °C than at higher temperatures. In contrast, metal immobilizing capacity of biochar was regardless of pyrolysis temperature and DOM removal. Therefore, pyrolyzing wheat straw at low temperature could produce a biochar for valorized separation of a significant DOM pool for use in vegetable production, leaving the residual biochar for amendment to metal contaminated soil."

"30693013","abstracttext","Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 (SnRK2) family members play crucial roles in plant abiotic stress response. However, the precise mechanism underlying the function of SnRKs has not been thoroughly elucidated in plants. In this research, a novel SnRK2 gene, TaSnRK2.9 was cloned and characterized from common wheat. The expression of TaSnRK2.9 was upregulated by polyethylene glycol (PEG), NaCl, H 2 O 2 , abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA), and ethrel treatments. TaSnRK2.9 was mainly expressed in wheat young root, stamen, pistil, and lemma. Overexpressing TaSnRK2.9 in transgenic tobacco enhanced plants' tolerance to drought and salt stresses both in young seedlings and mature plants with improved survival rate, seed germination rate, and root length. Physiological analyses suggest that TaSnRK2.9 improved antioxidant system such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), and glutathione (GSH) to reduce the H 2 O 2 content under drought or salt stress. Additionally, TaSnRK2.9 overexpression plants had elevated ABA content, implying that the function of TaSnRK2.9 may be ABA-dependent. Moreover, TaSnRK2.9 increased the expression of some ROS-related, ABA-related, and stress-response genes under osmotic or salt treatment. TaSnRK2.9 could interact with NtABF2 in yeast two-hybrid assay, and increased the expression of NtABF2 under mannitol or NaCl treatment in transgenic tobacco plants. In conclusion, overexpression of TaSnRK2.9 in tobacco conferred plants tolerance to drought and salt stresses through enhanced ROS scavenging ability, ABA-dependent signal transduction, and specific SnRK-ABF interaction."

"30722401","abstracttext","Triticale (×Triticosecale) is the intergeneric hybrid between the female parent wheat and the male parent rye. With the expansion of the triticale growing area, powdery mildew emerged on this new host and has become a significant disease on triticale. Recent research demonstrated that this ""new"" powdery mildew on triticale has emerged through a host range expansion of powdery mildew of wheat. Moreover, this expansion occurred recently and multiple times at different locations in Europe. An effective and environmentally sensitive approach to controlling powdery mildew involves breeding crop plants for resistance. The main goal of this study was to identify the presence of powdery mildew resistance in commercial triticale cultivars. First, the avirulence (AVR) genes and gene complexity carried by this new powdery mildew population on triticale were characterized. Virulence was identified for all the resistance genes evaluated in the present study, and virulence frequencies higher than 50% were recorded on the genes Pm3f, Pm5b, Pm6, Pm7, Pm8, and Pm17. Using molecular markers, the presence of resistance genes Pm3f and Pm17 was identified in certain triticale cultivars. The triticale cultivars were also evaluated for the presence of quantitative resistance at adult plant growth stages in a 2-year field experiment. Despite the high disease pressure, cultivars highly resistant at the adult-plant growth stages were identified. Because 'Grenado' also showed effective race-specific resistance, this cultivar could be of high value for breeding for durable resistance to powdery mildew. Altogether, this study reveals valuable information on the presence of powdery mildew resistance in commercial triticale cultivars, which can be used in breeding programs in triticale. Additionally, this study underscores the need to broaden the base of powdery mildew resistance in triticale through introgression and deployment of new sources of mildew resistance, including quantitative resistance."

The half maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) values varied greatly among the progeny isolates, ranging from 0.06 mg L -1 to 7.89 mg L -1 . Twenty-six of the 56 tested progeny isolates were less sensitive to triadimefon than the parental isolate. A single-nucleotide mutation at the 401 position resulting in an amino acid change from tyrosine (Y) to phenylalanine (F) in the 134th codon (Y134F) of the cytochrome P450 sterol 14a-demethylase enzyme ( CYP51 ), the target gene of DMI fungicide, was identified in the parental isolate. The 87 tested progeny isolates segregated into 19 homozygous wild type (AA), 40 heterozygous (AT), and 28 homozygous mutant (TT) genotypes, fitting a 1:2:1 ratio (χ 2 = 2.43; P = 0.30). The mutant isolates had higher EC 50 values than the wild type isolates. Significant differences in logEC 50 were found between the mutant isolates and the wild type isolates ( P = 2.2e -16 ). However, homozygous and heterozygous mutant isolates were not significantly different ( P = 0.21), indicating dominant mutation. Twenty-two progeny isolates were used to inoculate a susceptible wheat variety, and latency period and lesion growth were recorded to compare wild type and mutant isolates for the pathogenicity fitness components. A moderate but significant negative correlation was detected between lesion growth and sensitivity to triadimefon ( r = -0.53; P = 0.01). No significant variation in lesion growth was found between homozygous and heterozygous mutant isolates ( P = 0.83). In the case of latency period and triadimefon sensitivity, no significant correlation was found ( P = 0.17). These results are useful for understanding reduced sensitivity in the pathogen population and improving stripe rust management."

"31866690","abstracttext","Acrylamide is a processing contaminant and Group 2a carcinogen that was discovered in foodstuffs in 2002. Its presence in a range of popular foods has become one of the most difficult problems facing the food industry and its supply chain. Wheat, rye and potato products are major sources of dietary acrylamide, with biscuits, breakfast cereals, bread (particularly toasted), crispbread, batter, cakes, pies, French fries, crisps and snack products all affected. Here we briefly review the history of the issue, detection methods, the levels of acrylamide in popular foods and the risk that dietary acrylamide poses to human health. The pathways for acrylamide formation from free (non-protein) asparagine are described, including the role of reducing sugars such as glucose, fructose and maltose and the Maillard reaction. The evolving regulatory situation in the European Union and elsewhere is discussed, noting that food businesses and their suppliers must plan to comply not only with current regulations but with possible future regulatory scenarios. The main focus of the review is on the genetic and agronomic approaches being developed to reduce the acrylamide-forming potential of potatoes and cereals and these are described in detail, including variety selection, plant breeding, biotechnology and crop management. Obvious targets for genetic interventions include asparagine synthetase genes, and the asparagine synthetase gene families of different crop species are compared. Current knowledge on crop management best practice is described, including maintaining optimum storage conditions for potatoes and ensuring sulphur sufficiency and disease control for wheat."

However, it has low seed yield mainly caused by seed shattering, which makes seed production difficult for this species. The goals of this study were to construct the high-density genetic linkage map, and to identify QTLs and candidate genes for seed-yield related traits."
"31726988","abstracttext_results","An F 2 mapping population of 200 individuals was developed from a cross between single genotype from ""Y1005"" and ""ZhN06"". Specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) was applied to construct the first genetic linkage map. The final genetic map included 1971 markers on the 14 linkage groups (LGs) and was 1866.35 cM in total. The length of each linkage group varied from 87.67 cM (LG7) to 183.45 cM (LG1), with an average distance of 1.66 cM between adjacent markers. The marker sequences of E. sibiricus were compared to two grass genomes and showed 1556 (79%) markers mapped to wheat, 1380 (70%) to barley. Phenotypic data of eight seed-related traits (2016-2018) were used for QTL identification. A total of 29 QTLs were detected for eight seed-related traits on 14 linkage groups, of which 16 QTLs could be consistently detected for two or three years. A total of 6 QTLs were associated with seed shattering. Based on annotation with wheat and barley genome and transcriptome data of abscission zone in E. sibiricus, we identified 30 candidate genes for seed shattering, of which 15, 7, 6 and 2 genes were involved in plant hormone signal transcription, transcription factor, hydrolase activity and lignin biosynthetic pathway, respectively."

"31435704","abstracttext_key message","A major and stably expressed QTL for spikelet number per spike identified in a 2-cM interval on chromosome arm 2DS was validated using two populations with different genetic backgrounds. Spikelet number per spike (SNS) plays a key role in wheat yield improvement. Numerous genetic and environmental factors influencing SNS have been documented, but the number of major, stably expressed and validated loci underlying SNS is still limited. In this study, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a normal spikelet cultivar and a multiple-spikelet wheat line (with a longer spike with more canonically oriented apical spikelets) was genotyped using a Wheat55K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. SNS was measured for this RIL population in eight environments. Five QTL were each identified in two or more environments. One of them, QSns.sau-2D (LOD = 3.47-38.24, PVE = 10.16-45.68%), was detected in all the eight environments. The QTL was located in a 2-cM interval on chromosome arm 2DS flanked by the markers AX-109836946 and AX-111956072. This QTL, QSns.sau-2D, significantly increased SNS by up to 14.72%. Several genes associated with plant growth and development were identified in the physical interval of QSns.sau-2D. This QTL was further validated by the tightly linked Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) marker, KASP-AX-94721936, in two other populations with different genetic backgrounds. The significant correlation between SNS and anthesis date, plant height, spike length, grain number per spike and thousand-grain weight were detected and discussed. These results lay the foundation for fine mapping and cloning gene(s) underlying QSns.sau-2D."

"31603209","abstracttext","Genome analyses have revealed a profound role of hybridization and introgression in the evolution of many eukaryote lineages, including fungi. The impact of recurrent introgression on fungal evolution however remains elusive. Here, we analyzed signatures of introgression along the genome of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We applied a comparative population genomics approach, including genome data from five Zymoseptoria species, to characterize the distribution and composition of introgressed regions representing segments with an exceptional haplotype pattern. These regions are found throughout the genome, comprising 5% of the total genome and overlapping with > 1,000 predicted genes. We performed window-based phylogenetic analyses along the genome to distinguish regions which have a monophyletic or nonmonophyletic origin with Z. tritici sequences. A majority of nonmonophyletic windows overlap with the highly variable regions suggesting that these originate from introgression. We verified that incongruent gene genealogies do not result from incomplete lineage sorting by comparing the observed and expected length distribution of haplotype blocks resulting from incomplete lineage sorting. Although protein-coding genes are not enriched in these regions, we identify 18 that encode putative virulence determinants. Moreover, we find an enrichment of transposable elements in these regions implying that hybridization may contribute to the horizontal spread of transposable elements. We detected a similar pattern in the closely related species Zymoseptoria ardabiliae, suggesting that hybridization is widespread among these closely related grass pathogens. Overall, our results demonstrate a significant impact of recurrent hybridization on overall genome evolution of this important wheat pathogen."

"31553475","abstracttext","Transposable elements (TEs) are drivers of genome evolution and affect the expression landscape of the host genome. Stress is a major factor inducing TE activity; however, the regulatory mechanisms underlying de-repression are poorly understood. Plant pathogens are excellent models to dissect the impact of stress on TEs. The process of plant infection induces stress for the pathogen, and virulence factors (i.e., effectors) located in TE-rich regions become expressed. To dissect TE de-repression dynamics and contributions to virulence, we analyzed the TE expression landscape of four strains of the major wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici. We experimentally exposed strains to nutrient starvation and host infection stress. Contrary to expectations, we show that the two distinct conditions induce the expression of different sets of TEs. In particular, the most highly expressed TEs, including miniature inverted-repeat transposable element and long terminal repeat-Gypsy element, show highly distinct de-repression across stress conditions. Both the genomic context of TEs and the genetic background stress (i.e., different strains harboring the same TEs) were major predictors of de-repression under stress. Gene expression profiles under stress varied significantly depending on the proximity to the closest TEs and genomic defenses against TEs were largely ineffective to prevent de-repression. Next, we analyzed the locus encoding the Avr3D1 effector. We show that the insertion and subsequent silencing of TEs in close proximity likely contributed to reduced expression and virulence on a specific wheat cultivar. The complexity of TE responsiveness to stress across genetic backgrounds and genomic locations demonstrates substantial intraspecific genetic variation to control TEs with consequences for virulence."

However, there is a lack of information about their genomic features and metabolic capabilities. Here, we report the first in-depth genome/transcriptome survey of a Coniochaeta species (strain 2T2.1)."
"31572496","abstracttext_results","The genome of Coniochaeta sp. strain 2T2.1 has a size of 74.53 Mbp and contains 24,735 protein-encoding genes. Interestingly, we detected a genome expansion event, resulting ~ 98% of the assembly being duplicated with 91.9% average nucleotide identity between the duplicated regions. The lack of gene loss, as well as the high divergence and strong genome-wide signatures of purifying selection between copies indicates that this is likely a recent duplication, which arose through hybridization between two related Coniochaeta -like species (allopolyploidization). Phylogenomic analysis revealed that 2T2.1 is related Coniochaeta sp. PMI546 and Lecythophora sp. AK0013, which both occur endophytically. Based on carbohydrate-active enzyme (CAZy) annotation, we observed that even after in silico removal of its duplicated content, the 2T2.1 genome contains exceptional lignocellulolytic machinery. Moreover, transcriptomic data reveal the overexpression of proteins affiliated to CAZy families GH11, GH10 (endoxylanases), CE5, CE1 (xylan esterases), GH62, GH51 (α-l-arabinofuranosidases), GH12, GH7 (cellulases), and AA9 (lytic polysaccharide monoxygenases) when the fungus was grown on wheat straw compared with glucose as the sole carbon source."

"31539379","articletitle","Bulked segregant analysis RNA-seq (BSR-Seq) validated a stem resistance locus in Aegilops umbellulata, a wild relative of wheat."
"31539379","abstracttext","Many disease resistance genes that have been transferred from wild relatives to cultivated wheat have played a significant role in wheat production worldwide. Ae. umbellulata is one of the species within the genus Aegilops that have been successfully used as sources of resistance genes to leaf rust, stem rust and powdery mildew. The objectives of the current work was to validate the map position of a major QTL that confers resistance to the stem rust pathogen races Ug99 (TTKSK) and TTTTF with an independent bi-parental mapping population and to refine the QTL region with a bulk segregant analysis approach. Two F2 bi-parental mapping populations were developed from stem rust resistant Ae. umbellulata accessions (PI 298905 and PI 5422375) and stem rust susceptible accessions (PI 542369 and PI 554395). Firstly, one of the two populations was used to map the chromosome location of the resistance gene. Later on, the 2nd population was used to validate the chromosome location in combination with a bulk segregant analysis approach. For the bulk segregant analysis, RNA was extracted from a bulk of leaf tissues of 12 homozygous resistant F3 families, and a separate bulk of 11 susceptible homozygous F3 families derived from the PI 5422375 and PI 554395 cross. The RNA samples of the two bulks and the two parents were sequenced for SNPs identification. Stem rust resistance QTL was validated on chromosome 2U of Ae. umbellulata in the same region in both populations. With bulk segregant analysis, the QTL position was delimited within 3.2 Mbp. Although there were a large number of genes in the orthologous region of the detected QTL on chromosome 2D of Ae. tauschii, we detected only two Ae. umbellulata NLR genes which can be considered as a potential candidate genes."

"31698855","abstracttext","Phytoalexins are inducible antimicrobial metabolites in plants, and have been indicated to be important for the rejection of microbial infection. HPLC analysis detected the induced accumulation of three compounds 1 - 3 in barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) roots infected by Fusarium culmorum , the causal agent of Fusarium root rot. Compounds 1 - 3 were identified as cinnamic acid amides of 9-hydroxy-8-oxotryptamine, 8-oxotryptamine, and (1 H -indol-3-yl)methylamine, respectively, by spectroscopic analysis. Compounds 1 and 2 had been previously reported from wheat, whereas 3 was an undescribed compound. We named 1 - 3 as triticamides A-C, respectively, because they were isolated from barley and wheat, which belong to the Triticeae tribe. These compounds showed antimicrobial activities, indicating that triticamides function as phytoalexins in barley. The administration of deuterium-labeled N -cinnamoyl tryptamine (CinTry) to barley roots resulted in the effective incorporation of CinTry into 1 and 2 , which suggested that they were synthesized through the oxidation of CinTry. Nine putative tryptamine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase (THT)-encoding genes ( HvTHT1 - HvTHT9 ) were identified by database search on the basis of homology to known THT gene sequences from rice. Since HvTHT7 and HvTHT8 had the same sequences except one base, we measured their expression levels in total by RT-qPCR. HvTHT7 / 8 were markedly upregulated in response to infection by F. culmorum . The HvTHT7 and HvTHT8 enzymes preferred cinnamoyl- and feruloyl-CoAs as acyl donors and tryptamine as an acyl acceptor, and (1 H -indol-3-yl)methylamine was also accepted as an acyl acceptor. These findings suggested that HvTHT7/8 are responsible for the induced accumulation of triticamides in barley."

"33005918","abstracttext","The domestication and breeding of crops has been a major achievement for mankind enabling the development of stable societies and civilisation. Crops have become more productive per unit area of cultivated land over the course of domestication supporting a current global population of 7.8 billion. Food security crops such as wheat and maize have seen large changes compared with early progenitors. Amongst processes that have been altered in these crops, is the allocation of carbon resources to support larger grain yield (grain number and size). In wheat, reduction in stem height has enabled diversion of resources from stems to ears. This has freed up carbon to support greater grain yield. Green revolution genes responsible for reductions in stem height are known, but a unifying mechanism for the active regulation of carbon resource allocation towards and within sinks has however been lacking. The trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P) signalling system has emerged as a mechanism of resource allocation and has been implicated in several crop traits including assimilate partitioning and improvement of yield in different environments. Understanding the mode of action of T6P through the SnRK1 protein kinase regulatory system is providing a basis for a unifying mechanism controlling whole-plant resource allocation and source-sink interactions in crops. Latest results show it is likely that the T6P/SnRK1 pathway can be harnessed for further improvements such as grain number and grain filling traits and abiotic stress resilience through targeted gene editing, breeding and chemical approaches."

"33158141","abstracttext","The aim of the present study was to assess the microecosystem of 13 homemade spontaneously fermented wheat sourdoughs from different regions of Greece, through the combined use of culture-dependent (classical approach; clustering by Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RAPD-PCR) and identification by PCR species-specific for Lactiplantibacillus plantarum , and sequencing of the 16S-rRNA and 26S-rRNA gene, for Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) and yeasts, respectively) and independent approaches [DNA- and RNA-based PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE)]. The pH and Total Titratable Acidity (TTA) values ranged from 3.64-5.05 and from 0.50-1.59% lactic acid, respectively. Yeast and lactic acid bacteria populations ranged within 4.60-6.32 and 6.28-9.20 log CFU/g, respectively. The yeast: LAB ratio varied from 1:23-1:10,000. A total of 207 bacterial and 195 yeast isolates were obtained and a culture-dependent assessment of their taxonomic affiliation revealed dominance of Lb. plantarum in three sourdoughs, Levilactobacillus brevis in four sourdoughs and co-dominance of these species in two sourdoughs. In addition, Companilactobacillus paralimentarius dominated in two sourdoughs and Fructilactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Latilactobacillus sakei in one sourdough each. Lactococcus lactis , Lb. curvatus , Leuconostoc citreum , Ln . mesenteroides and Lb. zymae were also recovered from some samples. Regarding the yeast microbiota, it was dominated by Saccharomyces cerevisiae in 11 sourdoughs and Pichia membranifaciens and P. fermentans in one sourdough each. Wickerhamomyces anomalus and Kazachstania humilis were also recovered from one sample. RNA-based PCR-DGGE provided with nearly identical results with DNA-based one; in only one sample the latter provided an additional band. In general, the limitations of this approach, namely co-migration of amplicons from different species to the same electrophoretic position and multiband profile of specific isolates, greatly reduced resolution capacity, which resulted in only partial verification of the microbial ecology detected by culture-dependent approach in the majority of sourdough samples. Our knowledge regarding the microecosystem of spontaneously fermented Greek wheat-based sourdoughs was expanded, through the study of sourdoughs originating from regions of Greece that were not previously assessed."

"32760411","abstracttext","Rust diseases continuously threaten global wheat production: stem rust, leaf rust, and yellow rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici , Puccinia triticina , and Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici , respectively. Recent studies indicated that the average losses from all these three rusts reached up to 15.04 million tons per year, which is equivalent to an annual average loss of around US $2.9 billion per year. The major focus of Mexican and worldwide breeding programs is the release of rust resistant cultivars, as this is considered the best option for controlling rust diseases. In Mexico, the emphasis has been placed on genes that confer partial resistance in the adult plant stage and against a broad spectrum of rust races since the 1970s. In this study, a set of the first-generation tall varieties developed and released in the 1940s and 1950s, the first semi-dwarfs, and other releases in Mexico, all of which showed different levels of rust resistance have been phenotyped for the three rust diseases and genotyped. Results of the molecular marker detection indicated that Lr34 , Lr46 , Lr67 , and Lr68 alone or in different gene combinations were present among the wheat cultivars. Flag leaf tip necrosis was present in all cultivars and most were positive for brown necrosis or Pseudo Black Chaff associated with the Sr2 stem rust resistance complex. The phenotypic responses to the different rust infections indicate the presence of additional slow rusting and race-specific resistance genes. The study reveals the association of the slow rusting genes with durable resistance to the three rusts including Ug99 in cultivars bred before the green revolution such as Frontera, Supremo 211, Chapingo 48, Yaqui 50, Kentana 52, Bajio 52, Bajio 53, Yaqui 53, Chapingo 53, Yaktana Tardio 54, and Mayo 54 and their descendants after intercrossing and recombination.

Nine isolates having some characteristics related to plant growth promotion were identified as Staphylococcus hominis 7E, Streptomyces sp. 11E, Bacillus sp. 13E, Acinetobacter sp. 19E, from mung bean, Bacillus endophyticus 1E from cowpea, Staphylococcus hominis 9E, Bacillus endophyticus 14E, Brevundimonas sp. 16E and Kocuria sp. 26E from soybean nodules. Isolates 7E and 19E caused maximum growth inhibition of Fusarium on PDA plate. All isolates were able to grow at salinity levels of mixtures containing up to 400 mM of NaCl, CaCl 2 and MgCl 2 , but their growth was inhibited by increasing salinity level. Only the growth of isolate 14E increased at three levels of salinity compared with control. Some isolates, i.e. 7E, 14E, 19E and 26E had higher colony diameter at 45 °C after 48 h of incubation compared to the growth at 30 and 40 °C. Inoculation of soil with isolate 1E and isolate 26E caused to ameliorate salinity stress in wheat and increased the weight of 1000-grains as compared with non-inoculated treatments."

"33028975","abstracttext","Cropping systems have fertilized soils for decades with undetermined consequences for the productivity and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. One of the critical unknowns is the role of soil biodiversity in controlling crop production after decades of fertilization. This knowledge gap limits our capacity to assess how changes in soil biodiversity could alter crop production and soil health in changing environments. Here, we used multitrophic ecological networks to investigate the importance of soil biodiversity, in particular, the biodiversity of key-stone taxa in controlling soil functioning and wheat production in a 35-year field fertilization experiment. We found strong and positive associations between soil functional genes, crop production and the biodiversity of key-stone phylotypes; soils supporting a larger number of key-stone nematode, bacteria and fungi phylotypes yielded the highest wheat production. These key-stone phylotypes were also positively associated with plant growth (phototrophic bacteria, nitrogen fixers) and multiple functional genes related to nutrient cycling. The retrieved information on the genomes clustered with key-stone bacterial phylotypes indicated that the key-stone taxa had higher gene copies of oxidoreductases (participating most biogeochemical cycles of ecosystems and linking to microbial energetics) and 71 essential functional genes associated with carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur cycling. Altogether, our work highlights the fundamental role of the biodiversity of key-stone phylotypes in maintaining soil functioning and crop production after several decades of fertilization, and provides a list of key-stone phylotypes linking to crop production and soil nutrient cycling, which could give science-based guidance for sustainable food production."

"33091798","abstracttext","Aegilops tauschii Coss, a notorious wheat field weed, poses a serious threat to wheat in China. Tillers are an important agronomic tool for yield. In this study, a total of 12 Ae. tauschii populations were collected from China to investigate the effect of plant density on tiller occurrence and its phytohormonal regulation. We assayed the growth parameters of Ae. tauschii and the levels of endogenous hormones at different plant densities. The results showed that plant density had a significant effect on the quantity and quality of Ae. tauschii seeds produced per plant. In particular, the tiller and spike numbers per plant were negatively affected by plant density (P < 0.0001). The contents of 13 endogenous hormones in the tiller nodes changed in response to plant density. Among them, indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and gibberellin (GA) positively responded to plant density. However, the reverse result was found for cytokinin (CTK). Interestingly, phylogenetic tree analysis of auxin (AeYUCCA), CK (AeIPT) and GA (AeCPS) biosynthesis related genes found that phylogenies in the Gramineae for the three different genes were various, hinting at horizontal gene transfer. Moreover, the dynamics of the expression of AeYUCCA, AeIPT and AeCPS were roughly consistent with their phytohormone contents during tillering stage. When externally sprayed on plants of Ae. tauschii, 2,4-D isooctyl ester and GA 3 markedly reduced its tillering while 6-BA had no significant effect."

"33032258","abstracttext","Late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins are highly hydrophilic and thermostable proteins that could be induced by abiotic stresses in plants. Previously, we have isolated a group 3 LEA gene TdLEA3 in wheat. The data show that TdLEA3 was largely disordered under fully hydrated conditions and was able to prevent the inactivation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) under stress treatments. In the present work, we further investigate the role of TdLEA3 by analyzing its expression pattern under abiotic stress conditions in two contrasting wheat genotypes and by overexpressing it in Arabidopsis thaliana. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed higher tolerance levels to salt and oxidative stress compared to the wild type plants. Meanwhile, there was significant increase in antioxidants, catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) accumulation, increased root length and significant reduction in oxidants, hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the leaves of transgenic lines under stress conditions. Accordingly, Q-PCR results indicate that the higher levels of expression of different ROS scavenging genes (AtP5CS, AtCAT, AtPOD and AtSOD) and abiotic stress related genes (RAB18 and RD29B) were detected in transgenic lines. In addition, they showed increased resistance to fungal infections caused by Fusarium graminearum, Botrytis cinerea and Aspergillus niger. Finally, Q-PCR results for biotic stress related genes (PR1, PDF1.2, LOX3 and VSP2) showed differential expression in transgenic TdLEA3 lines. All these results strongly reinforce the interest of TdLEA3 in plant adaptation to various stresses."

The objective of the current study was to identify and characterize P. graminis f. sp. tritici race resistance association signals. A total of 250 North American spring wheat lines were evaluated at the seedling stage with a total of seven isolates including TKKTP, TKTTF, TKTTF, TRTTF, TTRTF, TTKSK, and TTKTT. The lines were genotyped by a GBS platform and 9,042 SNPs were used for identification of chromosome regions associated with resistance against the seven isolates. Strong association signals were detected on chromosomes 6BL (Sr11 gene region) and 4AL, likely Sr7a, for resistance against both TKKTP and TKTTF. Similarly, association signals were also detected on chromosomes 4AL (race TTRTF resistance) and 4BS (race TTKSK and TTKTT resistance). Association analysis based on mean phenotypic differences between closely related isolates identified QTL that were not elucidated by direct association mapping of the responses, individually. Overall, with the exception of race TRTTF, each race shared at least one association signal with another race. However, the number of race-specific association signals are larger than that of association signals common among races suggesting the need for identifying and characterizing QTL/genes for newly emerging stem rust pathogen races. There was also high concordance between PCA-based GWAS association signals and association signals from that of both single and multi-locus mixed models."

Flanking primers were designed for 384 unique SSR loci, which mapped to different locations of the draft genome sequence of the fungus. Of the 384 primer pairs tested, 72 EST-SSR markers were eventually developed, which showed polymorphism among 19 isolates of P. graminis f. sp. tritici and 4 isolates of P. graminis f. sp. secalis evaluated. Thirty-two of the SSR loci were also evaluated in three other rust fungi (P. triticina, P. hordei, and P. coronata f. sp. hordei) for cross-species transferability. These SSR markers derived from ESTs will be useful for characterization of population structures and for gene mapping in P. graminis."

"19483781","abstracttext","A polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading bacterium isolated from oil-polluted soil was identified as Microbacterium sp. F10a based on 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis. Plant growth promoting characteristics of the strain, degradation rate of phenanthrene and pyrene, and cell surface hydrophobicity characteristics of the strain were further characterized. The strain was also evaluated for promoting the growth of wheat and phenanthrene and pyrene removal from soil artificially contaminated with a mixture of phenanthrene (200 mg.kg-1) and pyrene (150 mg.kg-1) in pot experiments. The strain had the plant growth promoting characteristics of producing indole acetic acid, siderophore, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase activity and solubilizing inorganic phosphate. The strain also has a cell surface hydrophobicity that could increase the aqueous polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon solubility. High-performance liquid chromatographic analysis showed that the degradation rates of phenanthrene (50 mg.L-1) and pyrene (20 mg.L-1) were 98% and 65%, respectively, under 28 degrees C after 7 days. Inoculation with the strain was found to significantly increase (p < 0.05) the growth of wheat and phenanthrene and pyrene removal in the unplanted or planted soils in a low-temperature environment. There were no significant differences in culturable bacterial numbers between live bacterial inoculation and dead bacterial inoculation controls in the unplanted and planted soils. However, the numbers of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon degrading bacteria were significantly greater in the inoculated planted or unplanted soils compared with the dead bacterial inoculation controls."

"25604990","abstracttext_key message","TaUBA functions as a negative regulator of salt and drought stress response in transgenic Arabidopsis, either the UBA domain or the zinc finger domain is crucial for TaUBA's function. TaUBA (DQ211935), which is a UBA domain-containing protein in wheat, was cloned and functionally characterized. Southern blot suggested that TaUBA is a low copy gene in common wheat. qRT-PCR assay showed that the expression of TaUBA was strongly induced by salt and drought stress. When suffering from drought and salt stresses, lower proline content and much higher MDA content in the TaUBA overexpressors were observed than those of the wild-type control, suggesting TaUBA may function as a negative regulator of salt and drought stress response in plants. To study whether the UBA domain or the zinc finger domain affects the function of TaUBA, TaUBAΔUBA (deletion of UBA domain) and TaUBA-M (Cys464Gly and Cys467Gly) overexpression vectors were constructed and transformed into Arabidopsis. Upon drought and salt stresses, the TaUBAΔUBA-and TaUBA-M-overexpressed plants accumulated much more proline and lower MDA than the wild-type control, the TaUBA-overexpressors lost water more quickly than TaUBAΔUBA-and TaUBA-M-overexpressed plants as well as the wild-type control, suggesting that overexpression of TaUBAΔUBA or TaUBA-M improved the drought and salt tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis plants and the possibility of ubiquitination role in the regulation of osmolyte synthesis and oxidative stress responses in mediating stress tolerance. qRT-PCR assay of stress-related genes in transgenic plants upon drought and salt stresses suggested that TaUBA may function through down-regulating some stress related-transcription factors and by regulating P5CSs to cope with osmotic stress."

"25239218","abstracttext_key message","In wheat, advantageous gene-rich or pleiotropic regions for stripe, leaf, and stem rust and epistatic interactions between rust resistance loci should be accounted for in plant breeding strategies. Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks.) and stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. tritici Eriks) contribute to major production losses in many regions worldwide. The objectives of this research were to identify and study epistatic interactions of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stripe and leaf rust resistance in a doubled haploid (DH) population derived from the cross of Canadian wheat cultivars, AC Cadillac and Carberry. The relationship of leaf and stripe rust resistance QTL that co-located with stem rust resistance QTL previously mapped in this population was also investigated. The Carberry/AC Cadillac population was genotyped with DArT(®) and simple sequence repeat markers. The parents and population were phenotyped for stripe rust severity and infection response in field rust nurseries in Kenya (Njoro), Canada (Swift Current), and New Zealand (Lincoln); and for leaf rust severity and infection response in field nurseries in Canada (Swift Current) and New Zealand (Lincoln). AC Cadillac was a source of stripe rust resistance QTL on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 3A, 3B, 5B, and 7B; and Carberry was a source of resistance on chromosomes 2B, 4B, and 7A. AC Cadillac contributed QTL for resistance to leaf rust on chromosome 2A and Carberry contributed QTL on chromosomes 2B and 4B. Stripe rust resistance QTL co-localized with previously reported stem rust resistance QTL on 2B, 3B, and 7B, while leaf rust resistance QTL co-localized with 4B stem rust resistance QTL. Several epistatic interactions were identified both for stripe and leaf rust resistance QTL. We have identified useful combinations of genetic loci with main and epistatic effects. Multiple disease resistance regions identified on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, and 7B are prime candidates for further investigation and validation of their broad resistance."

"33169935","abstracttext","Soft red winter wheat (SRWW) cultivar AGS 2038 has a high level of seedling and adult plant leaf rust (LR) resistance. To map and characterize LR resistance in AGS 2038, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population consisting of 225 lines was developed from a cross between AGS 2038 and moderately resistant line UGA 111729. The parents and RIL population were phenotyped for LR response in three field environments at Plains and Griffin, GA, in the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 growing seasons, one greenhouse environment at the adult-plant stage, and at seedling stage. The RIL population was genotyped with the Illumina iSelect 90K SNP marker array, and a total of 7667 polymorphic markers representing 1513 unique loci were used to construct a linkage map. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis detected six QTL, QLr.ags-1AL, QLr.ags-2AS, QLr.ags-2BS1, QLr.ags-2BS2, QLr.ags-2BS3, and QLr.ags-2DS, for seedling and adult plant LR resistance. Of these, the major adult plant leaf rust resistance QTL, QLr.ags-1AL, was detected on all field and greenhouse adult plant tests and explained up to 34.45% of the phenotypic variation. QLr.ags-1AL, tightly flanked by IWB20487 and IWA4022 markers, was contributed by AGS 2038. Molecular marker analysis using a diagnostic marker linked to Lr59 showed that QLr.ags-1AL was different from Lr59, the only known LR resistance gene on 1AL. Therefore, the QTL was temporarily designated as Lr2K38. Lr2K38-linked marker IWB20487 was highly polymorphic among 30 SRWW lines and should be useful for selecting the Lr2K38 in wheat breeding programs."

A(1)-beta-casein has been associated with increased diabetes frequency in ecological studies and in NOD mice. Our aim was to ascertain whether A(1)-beta-casein was more diabetogenic than A(2) and to test the diabetogenicity of a milk-free diet in animals representing different forms of spontaneous Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus."
"12242456","abstracttext_methods","Defined diets were coded and shipped to laboratories in New Zealand (NOD/NZ), Canada (BB) and the UK (NOD/Ba). Base diets were Pregestimil (PG) and ProSobee (PS). Purified fractions of whole casein (WC), A(1)or A(2)-beta-casein were added at 10%. A milk-free, wheat-predominant, NTP-2000 diet was the control.

"12242456","abstracttext_conclusion/interpretation","A milk-free, wheat-predominant diet was highly diabetogenic in three widely separate locations in both animal models. A previous result that A(1) beta-casein was more diabetogenic than A(2) beta-casein in NOD mice was not confirmed; both beta-casein variants were protective in BB rats and NOD mice. Whole Casein promoted diabetes in NOD/Ba but protected BB showing that unique diabetes haplotypes react differently to dietary proteins. A(1)- was more diabetogenic than A(2)-beta-casein only in PS-fed BB rats. Neither the analysis of insulitis nor of pancreatic cytokine gene expression showed a difference between A(1) or A(2) beta-casein fed animals. Milk caseins are unlikely to be exclusive promoters of Type I diabetes, but could enhance the outcome of diabetes in some cases. Other diet components such as wheat could be more important promoters of Type I diabetes."

"17385521","abstracttext","Flour beetles attack stored grain products such as flour, cereals, meal, dried pet food, dried flowers and even dried museum specimens and other foods in the house. Stored-product insects cause tremendous losses by lowering weight, germination rate, nutritional value and grain grade. These beetles are of the most important pests of stored products in the home and grocery stores. The adult female may live for as long as two years, depositing 300 to 400 eggs. The life cycle requires one to four months when temperatures are favorable. Several methods could be used to control this insect including synthetic insecticides, biological control, physical control and transgenic plant carrying gene of interest. Chemical controls are discouraged due to pesticide residue in the commodities and resistance in insects. The study of insect digestive enzymes seems to make sense in the realization that the gut is the major interface between the insect and its environment. Hence, an understanding of digestive enzyme function is essential when developing methods of insect control such as the use of enzyme inhibitors and transgenic plants to control insect pests. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to get a good understanding from enzyme composition of different larval stages of the insect and finally characterize amylase which is the key enzyme in digestive system of this insect. For alpha-amylase study whole larvae were homogenized in 0.02 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. The homogenates were separately transferred to a 1.5 ml of centrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 15000xg for 20 min at 4degrees C. The supernatants were used as enzyme source in assays. alpha-Amylase activity was assayed by the dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS) procedure using 1% soluble starch (Merck) as substrate. The results show that enzyme activity (OD) in the first, second, third and fourth larval stages were 0.5, 1.15, 1.35 and 1.362, respectively. There are significant differences in amylase activity in different larval stages; however, there are no significant differences in the enzyme activity of two last larval stages. Wheat grain is a major source of starch and insect that feed on the wheat grain or flour made from wheat rely heavily on their amylase for starch hydrolyze and this could be the main reason that larval stages even first larval instar has such a high amount of alpha-amylase."

"26822785","abstracttext_background","Functional metagenomics is a promising strategy for the exploration of the biocatalytic potential of microbiomes in order to uncover novel enzymes for industrial processes (e.g. biorefining or bleaching pulp). Most current methodologies used to screen for enzymes involved in plant biomass degradation are based on the use of single substrates. Moreover, highly diverse environments are used as metagenomic sources. However, such methods suffer from low hit rates of positive clones and hence the discovery of novel enzymatic activities from metagenomes has been hampered."
"26822785","abstracttext_results","Here, we constructed fosmid libraries from two wheat straw-degrading microbial consortia, denoted RWS (bred on untreated wheat straw) and TWS (bred on heat-treated wheat straw). Approximately 22,000 clones from each library were screened for (hemi)cellulose-degrading enzymes using a multi-chromogenic substrate approach. The screens yielded 71 positive clones for both libraries, giving hit rates of 1:440 and 1:1,047 for RWS and TWS, respectively. Seven clones (NT2-2, T5-5, NT18-17, T4-1, 10BT, NT18-21 and T17-2) were selected for sequence analyses. Their inserts revealed the presence of 18 genes encoding enzymes belonging to twelve different glycosyl hydrolase families (GH2, GH3, GH13, GH17, GH20, GH27, GH32, GH39, GH53, GH58, GH65 and GH109). These encompassed several carbohydrate-active gene clusters traceable mainly to Klebsiella related species. Detailed functional analyses showed that clone NT2-2 (containing a beta-galactosidase of ~116 kDa) had highest enzymatic activity at 55 °C and pH 9.0. Additionally, clone T5-5 (containing a beta-xylosidase of ~86 kDa) showed > 90% of enzymatic activity at 55 °C and pH 10.0."

The approach, consisting of screens on multi-substrates coupled to further analyses, revealed high hit rates, as compared with recent other studies. Two clones, 10BT and T4-1, required the presence of multiple substrates for detectable activity, indicating a new avenue in library activity screening. Finally, clones NT2-2, T5-5 and NT18-17 were found to encode putative novel thermo-alkaline enzymes, which could represent a starting point for further biotechnological applications."

"26734019","abstracttext","Identification of genes for yield components, plant height (PH), and yield-related physiological traits and tightly linked molecular markers is of great importance in marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding. In the present study, 246 F8 RILs derived from the cross of Zhou 8425B/Chinese Spring were genotyped using the high-density Illumina iSelect 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assay. Field trials were conducted at Zhengzhou and Zhoukou of Henan Province, during the 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 cropping season under irrigated conditions, providing data for four environments. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of agronomic and physiological traits revealed significant differences (P < 0.01) among RILs, environments, and RILs × environments interactions. Broad-sense heritabilities of all traits including thousand kernel weight (TKW), PH, spike length (SL), kernel number per spike (KNS), spike number/m(2) (SN), normalized difference in vegetation index at anthesis (NDVI-A) and at 10 days post-anthesis (NDVI-10), SPAD value of chlorophyll content at anthesis (Chl-A) and at 10 days post-anthesis (Chl-10) ranged between 0.65 and 0.94. A linkage map spanning 3609.4 cM was constructed using 5636 polymorphic SNP markers, with an average chromosome length of 171.9 cM and marker density of 0.64 cM/marker. A total of 866 SNP markers were newly mapped to the hexaploid wheat linkage map. Eighty-six QTL for yield components, PH, and yield-related physiological traits were detected on 18 chromosomes except 1D, 5D, and 6D, explaining 2.3-33.2% of the phenotypic variance. Ten stable QTL were identified across four environments, viz. QTKW.caas-6A.1, QTKW.caas-7AL, QKNS.caas-4AL, QSN.caas-1AL.1, QPH.caas-4BS.2, QPH.caas-4DS.1, QSL.caas-4AS, QSL.caas-4AL.1, QChl-A.caas-5AL, and QChl-10.caas-5BL. Meanwhile, 10 QTL-rich regions were found on chromosome 1BS, 2AL (2), 3AL, 4AL (2), 4BS, 4DS, 5BL, and 7AL exhibiting pleiotropic effects. These QTL or QTL clusters are tightly linked to SNP markers, with genetic distances to the closest SNPs ranging from 0 to 1.5 cM, and could serve as target regions for fine mapping, candidate gene discovery, and MAS in wheat breeding."
"27795389","articletitle","The Evolution of Orphan Regions in Genomes of a Fungal Pathogen of Wheat."
"27795389","abstracttext","Fungal plant pathogens rapidly evolve virulence on resistant hosts through mutations in genes encoding proteins that modulate the host immune responses. The mutational spectrum likely includes chromosomal rearrangements responsible for gains or losses of entire genes. However, the mechanisms creating adaptive structural variation in fungal pathogen populations are poorly understood. We used complete genome assemblies to quantify structural variants segregating in the highly polymorphic fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici The genetic basis of virulence in Z. tritici is complex, and populations harbor significant genetic variation for virulence; hence, we aimed to identify whether structural variation led to functional differences. We combined single-molecule real-time sequencing, genetic maps, and transcriptomics data to generate a fully assembled and annotated genome of the highly virulent field isolate 3D7. Comparative genomics analyses against the complete reference genome IPO323 identified large chromosomal inversions and the complete gain or loss of transposable-element clusters, explaining the extensive chromosomal-length polymorphisms found in this species. Both the 3D7 and IPO323 genomes harbored long tracts of sequences exclusive to one of the two genomes. These orphan regions contained 296 genes unique to the 3D7 genome and not previously known for this species. These orphan genes tended to be organized in clusters and showed evidence of mutational decay. Moreover, the orphan genes were enriched in genes encoding putative effectors and included a gene that is one of the most upregulated putative effector genes during wheat infection. Our study showed that this pathogen species harbored extensive chromosomal structure polymorphism that may drive the evolution of virulence."
"27795389","abstracttext_importance","Pathogen outbreak populations often harbor previously unknown genes conferring virulence. Hence, a key puzzle of rapid pathogen evolution is the origin of such evolutionary novelty in genomes. Chromosomal rearrangements and structural variation in pathogen populations likely play a key role. However, identifying such polymorphism is challenging, as most genome-sequencing approaches only yield information about point mutations. We combined long-read technology and genetic maps to assemble the complete genome of a strain of a highly polymorphic fungal pathogen of wheat. Comparisons against the reference genome of the species showed substantial variation in the chromosome structure and revealed large regions unique to each assembled genome. These regions were enriched in genes encoding likely effector proteins, which are important components of pathogenicity. Our study showed that pathogen populations harbor extensive polymorphism at the chromosome level and that this polymorphism can be a source of adaptive genetic variation in pathogen evolution."

"28733288","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum (teleomorph: Ascomycota, Hypocreales, Gibberella , Gibberella zeae ) is a destructive fungal pathogen that threatens the production and quality of wheat and barley worldwide. Controlling this toxin-producing pathogen is a significant challenge. In the present study, the commercially available strain Bacillus amyloliquefaciens ( Bacteria , Firmicutes , Bacillales , Bacillus ) FZB42 showed strong activity against F. graminearum The lipopeptide bacillomycin D, produced by FZB42, was shown to contribute to the antifungal activity. Purified bacillomycin D showed strong activity against F. graminearum , and its 50% effective concentration was determined to be approximately 30 μg/ml. Analyses using scanning and transmission electron microscopy revealed that bacillomycin D caused morphological changes in the plasma membranes and cell walls of F. graminearum hyphae and conidia. Fluorescence microscopy combined with different dyes showed that bacillomycin D induced the accumulation of reactive oxygen species and caused cell death in F. graminearum hyphae and conidia. F. graminearum secondary metabolism also responded to bacillomycin D challenge, by increasing the production of deoxynivalenol. Biological control experiments demonstrated that bacillomycin D exerted good control of F. graminearum on corn silks, wheat seedlings, and wheat heads. In response to bacillomycin D, F. graminearum genes involved in scavenging reactive oxygen species were downregulated, whereas genes involved in the synthesis of deoxynivalenol were upregulated. Phosphorylation of MGV1 and HOG1, the mitogen-activated protein kinases of F. graminearum , was increased in response to bacillomycin D. Taken together, these findings reveal the mechanism of the antifungal action of bacillomycin D. IMPORTANCE Biological control of plant disease caused by Fusarium graminearum is desirable. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42 is a representative of the biocontrol bacterial strains. In this work, the lipopeptide bacillomycin D, produced by FZB42, showed strong fungicidal activity against F. graminearum Bacillomycin D caused morphological changes in the plasma membrane and cell wall of F. graminearum , induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species, and ultimately caused cell death in F. graminearum Interestingly, when F. graminearum was challenged with bacillomycin D, the deoxynivalenol production, gene expression, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, and pathogenicity of F. graminearum were significantly altered. These findings clarified the mechanisms of the activity of bacillomycin D against F. graminearum and highlighted the potential of B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 as a biocontrol agent against F. graminearum ."

White shrimp (mean initial weight 1.02 g) were fed seven isonitrogenous diets, Diet 1 as the control, Diet 2-4 was supplemented with grade levels (250, 500 and 1000 μg kg -1 ) of deoxynivalenol (DON), Diet 5-7 were formulated to contain graded levels of contaminated wheat flour. Each diet was assigned to four tanks (30 shrimp). The weight gain was decreased with the increasing dietary DON levels, survival was lower in shrimp fed high levels of DON-contaminated wheat flour (P < 0.05). Feed intake and feed conversion ratio did not show any difference among all the groups. After 4 h hypoxia stress, survival of shrimp was decreased in shrimp fed high levels of DON-contaminated wheat flour (P < 0.05). Total antioxidant capacity in hepatopancreas was higher in shrimp fed the control diet, glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were higher in shrimp fed the Diet 3 and Diet 6, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was higher in shrimp fed the highest dietary DON (Diet 4), while the gene expression of SOD and GPx were lower in shrimp fed the Diet 3-7. The expression of HSP70, Toll 1 and Dorsal were higher in shrimp fed the Diet 2, the expression of AKT were higher in shrimp fed the Diet 1 and Diet 2. The expression of proPO, LGBP and PPAF were higher in shrimp fed the Diet 4 and Diet 7. The H&E stain indicated intestinal mucosal folds were impaired in shrimp fed the Diet 3-7, and B cells number and diameters of the hepatopancreas tubules were affected by DON levels, and transmission electron microscope (TEM) analysis indicated the apopotosis occurs in intestinal epithelial cell of shrimp fed the Diet 2-7. Based on the present results, the safety level of DON for white shrimp should below 0.5 ppm, which was much less than the European Communities recommendation values for aquatic animals (5 ppm). High level of DON would damage the cell structural and affect the NF-κB pathway and proPO system of shrimp."

"30673473","abstracttext","A unique foliar disease of spinach, determined to be caused by Pythium aphanidermatum, was observed on spinach in Yuma County, AZ and Imperial County, CA desert spinach production areas in both 2015 and 2016. The foliar symptoms of the disease included water-soaked foliage, rapid collapse of young plants, and white, aerial, cottony mycelia. The disease was associated with hot (27 to 42°C) and wet conditions associated with overhead irrigation under high-density plantings (>8.0 million seeds/ha). Isolations were performed on symptomatic tissue, and DNA was recovered from pure culture of the isolates recovered and sequenced using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) primers ITS1/ITS4 and gene cytochrome oxidase I (COXI) primers FM55 and FM59. BLAST searches in GenBank indicated that the isolates were P. aphanidermatum based on 99 to 100% homology of ITS rDNA. Moreover, the DNA sequences of the ITS and COXI were identical for the five representative isolates. The objective of this research was to determine whether P. aphanidermatum recovered from symptomatic spinach tissue was able to cause foliar web blight and damping-off of spinach and other crops. In addition to spinach, other hosts evaluated included cotton, soybean, pepper, tomato, cucumber, melon, squash, lettuce, corn, wheat, and rice in greenhouse trials. Inoculations were performed by either foliar inoculations or infesting the soil with plugs of potato dextrose agar colonized by the P. aphanidermatum. Web blight symptoms were severe on spinach and all other dicotyledonous hosts tested, except lettuce. No web blight symptoms were observed on corn or rice, and only minor symptoms were observed on 10-day-old seedlings of wheat. P. aphanidermatum caused severe preemergence damping-off of all dicotyledonous plant species tested but only caused limited seedling size reduction in corn and wheat. Mefenoxam treatment of spinach seed provided complete protection against preemergence damping-off of spinach at both low (0.15 g a.i./kg of seed) and high (0.70 g a.i./kg of seed) rates of application, and the high rate of the application resulted in complete protection against web blight of spinach for 10 to 20 days after planting."

"31191471","abstracttext","Diazotrophic bacteria can reduce N 2 into plant-available ammonium (NH 4 + ), promoting plant growth and reducing nitrogen (N) fertilizer requirements. However, there are few systematic studies on the effects of diazotrophic bacteria on biological N 2 fixation (BNF) contribution rate and host plant N uptake and metabolism. In this study, the interactions of the diazotrophic Paenibacillus beijingensis BJ-18 with wheat, maize, and cucumber were investigated when it was inoculated to these plant seedlings grown in both low N and high N soils, with un-inoculated plants as controls. This study showed that GFP-tagged P. beijingensis BJ-18 colonized inside and outside seedlings, forming rhizospheric and endophytic colonies in roots, stems, and leaves. The numbers of this bacterium in the inoculated plants depended on soil N levels. Under low N, inoculation significantly increased shoot dry weight (wheat 86.1%, maize 46.6%, and cucumber 103.6%) and root dry weight (wheat 46.0%, maize 47.5%, and cucumber 20.3%). The 15 N-isotope-enrichment experiment indicated that plant seedlings derived 12.9-36.4% N from BNF. The transcript levels of nifH in the inoculated plants were 0.75-1.61 folds higher in low N soil than those in high N soil. Inoculation enhanced NH 4 + and nitrate (NO 3 - ) uptake from soil especially under low N. The total N in the inoculated plants were increased by 49.1-92.3% under low N and by 13-15.5% under high N. Inoculation enhanced activities of glutamine synthetase (GS) and nitrate reductase (NR) in plants, especially under low N. The expression levels of N uptake and N metabolism genes: AMT (ammonium transporter), NRT (nitrate transporter), NiR (nitrite reductase), NR, GS and GOGAT (glutamate synthase) in the inoculated plants grown under low N were up-regulated 1.5-91.9 folds, but they were not obviously changed under high N. Taken together, P. beijingensis BJ-18 was an effective, endophytic and diazotrophic bacterium. This bacterium contributed to plants with fixed N 2 , promoted plant growth and N uptake, and enhanced gene expression and enzyme activities involved in N uptake and assimilation in plants. However, these positive effects on plants were regulated by soil N status. This study might provide insight into the interactions of plants with beneficial associative and endophytic diazotrophic bacteria."

"31695716","abstracttext","Prompted by recent changes in climate trends, cropping areas, and management practices, Fusarium head blight (FHB), a threatening disease of cereals worldwide, is also spreading in unusual environments, where bread wheat (BW) and durum wheat (DW) are largely cultivated. The scarcity of efficient resistance sources within adapted germplasm is particularly alarming for DW, mainly utilized for human consumption, which is therefore at high risk of kernel contamination by health-dangerous mycotoxins (e.g., deoxynivalenol = DON). To cope with this scenario, we looked outside the wheat primary gene pool and recently transferred an exceptionally effective FHB resistance QTL ( Fhb-7EL ) from Thinopyrum elongatum 7EL chromosome arm onto a Thinopyrum ponticum 7el 1 L arm segment, containing additional valuable genes (including Lr19 for leaf rust resistance and Yp for yellow pigment content), distally inserted onto 7DL of BW lines. Two such lines were crossed with two previously developed DW- Th. ponticum recombinants, having 7el 1 L distal portions on 7AL arms. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) analysis showed homologous pairing, which is enabled by 7el 1 L segments common to the BW and DW recombinant chromosomes, to occur with 42-78% frequency, depending on the shared 7el 1 L amount. Aided by 7EL/7el 1 L-linked markers, 7EL+7el 1 L tetraploid recombinant types were isolated in BC 1 progenies to DW of all cross combinations. Homozygous 7EL+7el 1 L recombinant plants and null segregates selected in BC 2 F 2 progenies were challenged by Fusarium graminearum spike inoculation to verify the Fhb-7EL efficacy in DW. Infection outcomes confirmed previous observations in BW, with >90% reduction of disease severity associated with Fhb-7EL presence vs . its absence. The same differential effect was detected on seed set and weight of inoculated spikes, with genotypes lacking Fhb-7EL having ∼80% reduction compared with unaffected values of Fhb-7EL carriers. In parallel, DON content in flour extracts of resistant recombinants averaged 0.67 ppm, a value >800 times lower than that of susceptible controls. Furthermore, as observed in BW, the same Fhb-7EL also provided the novel DW recombinants with resistance to Fusarium crown rot (∼60% symptom reduction) as from seedling infection with Fusarium culmorum . Through alien segment stacking, we succeeded in equipping DW with a very effective barrier against different Fusarium diseases and other positive attributes for crop security and safety."

"2987921","abstracttext","We have used heterologous hybridization and DNA sequence analysis to determine whether the 16-kilobase-pair (kbp) DNA from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mitochondria is the functional equivalent of mtDNA in other eukaryotes. Restriction fragments corresponding to a continuous internal stretch spanning 75% of the 16-kbp DNA have been cloned and mapped, and regions hybridizing with probes specific for the cytochrome oxidase subunit I [CytOx I (acronym COI)] and apocytochrome b (Cyt b) genes of yeast and the mitochondrial 26S and 18S rRNA genes of wheat have been identified. Sequence analysis has verified the presence of CytOx I and the large and small subunit rRNA genes in the C. reinhardtii 16-kbp DNA. In the region of the 16-kbp DNA corresponding to exon 4 in the yeast CytOx I gene, the derived amino acid sequence is 61% and 63% identical with the CytOx I amino acid sequences of yeast and human mitochondria, respectively. Notably, tryptophan is specified by TGG rather than by TGA in this section of the C. reinhardtii CytOx I gene. A probe from the CytOx I region of the 16-kbp DNA hybridizes only with this 16-kbp DNA in Southern blots of total cellular DNA from C. reinhardtii but with a larger DNA species in the total cellular DNA of C. moewusii and C. eugametos--two species that lack a 16-kbp DNA. These observations provide evidence that C. reinhardtii 16-kbp DNA comprises at least part of the mitochondrial genome of this organism and that a homologous DNA exists in other species of Chlamydomonas."
"3010552","articletitle","Two glycoproteins are produced from the rotavirus neutralization gene."
"3010552","abstracttext","The major neutralization antigen of rotaviruses is an outer capsid glycoprotein, VP7, with an apparent molecular weight of 38,000 (38K). The simian rotavirus SA11 genome segment 9, which codes for VP7, contains two in-phase initiation codons, each of which is followed by a sequence that codes for a region of hydrophobic amino acids. We have determined that this gene is functionally bicistronic by analyzing the synthesis of VP7 in SA11-infected cells and in cell-free translation systems programmed with hybrid-selected, segment 9 specific mRNA and dog pancreatic microsomes. The translation of hybrid-selected gene 9 mRNA in wheat germ extracts yielded two distinct polypeptides of molecular weights 37K and 35.3K. In vitro translation in the presence of microsomes yielded one diffuse band of 38K that was converted into the 37K and 35.3K precursor bands by digestion with endoglycosidase H. Studies with a variant of SA11 that lacks the glycosylation site in VP7 confirmed these precursor-product relationships and extended them by indicating that the glycoprotein produced by translation from the first AUG contained a cleaved signal sequence whereas the glycoprotein produced by translation from the second AUG contained an uncleaved signal sequence. Immunoprecipitation with monospecific anti-VP7 serum and improved gel electrophoresis conditions allowed us to show that both VP7s were expressed at similar times in infected cells and both were found in purified virus particles of several different rotavirus strains. Whether these two VP7 glycoproteins are functionally distinct remains to be determined."
"2999159","articletitle","Deletions into an NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain result in secretion of rotavirus VP7, a resident endoplasmic reticulum membrane glycoprotein."
"2999159","abstracttext","Rotavirus, a non-enveloped reovirus, buds into the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transiently acquires a membrane. The structural glycoprotein, VP7, a 38-kD integral membrane protein of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), presumably transfers to virus in this process. The gene for VP7 potentially encodes a protein of 326 amino acids which has two tandem hydrophobic domains at the NH2-terminal, each preceded by an in-frame ATG codon. A series of deletion mutants constructed from a full-length cDNA clone of the Simian 11 rotavirus VP7 gene were expressed in COS 7 cells. Products from wild-type, and mutants which did not affect the second hydrophobic domain of VP7, were localized by immunofluorescence to elements of the ER only. However, deletions affecting the second hydrophobic domain (mutants 42-61, 43-61, 47-61) showed immunofluorescent localization of VP7 which coincided with that of wheat germ agglutinin, indicating transport to the Golgi apparatus. Immunoprecipitable wild-type protein, or an altered protein lacking the first hydrophobic sequence, remained intracellular and endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H sensitive. In contrast, products of mutants 42-61, 43-61, and 47-61 were transported from the ER, and secreted. Glycosylation of the secreted molecules was inhibited by tunicamycin, resistant to endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H digestion and therefore of the N-linked complex type. An unglycosylated version of VP7 was also secreted. We suggest that the second hydrophobic domain contributes to a positive signal for ER location and a membrane anchor function. Secretion of the mutant glycoprotein implies that transport can be constitutive with the destination being dictated by an overriding compartmentalization signal."
"1922082","articletitle","Differential translatability in vitro of multiple messenger RNAs encoding the beta-subunit of mouse thyrotropin."
"1922082","abstracttext","The mouse TSH beta gene contains two start sites of transcription and exhibits alternative splicing among its first three exons, which encode 5'-untranslated mRNA sequences. Expression of the mouse TSH beta gene, therefore, gives rise to multiple mRNAs, each with a unique 5'-untranslated region. We have determined the relative translational efficiencies of these mRNAs in vitro, and we demonstrate that one of them directs the synthesis of a novel TSH beta presubunit. The four TSH beta mRNAs that are expressed from the down-stream transcription start site (TSS2) and the major mRNA derived from the up-stream start site (TSS1) were transcribed in vitro and translated in reticulocyte lysates and wheat germ extracts. The mRNA from TSS1 gave a novel TSH beta presubunit due to initiation of translation at an up-stream AUG unique to this mRNA. The novel presubunit contained a 17-amino acid NH2-terminal extension sequence, compared to the normal TSH beta presubunit, which is encoded by each of the mRNAs from TSS2. Despite the fact that the NH2-terminal extension sequence appeared to lack the characteristics of a signal peptide, the novel TSH beta presubunit was processed about 50% as efficiently by microsomal membranes as the normal presubunit, with glycosylation and cleavage by signal peptidase. There was an approximately 2-fold range in relative translatability among the different TSH beta mRNAs, and the mRNA encoding the novel TSH beta presubunit had the highest translational efficiency. Our data, therefore, suggest that the longer presubunit may be synthesized in vivo in significant amounts and give rise to a novel mature TSH beta subunit."

"1738601","abstracttext","Iron regulatory factor (IRF), also called iron responsive element-binding protein (IRE-BP), is a cytoplasmic RNA-binding protein which regulates post-transcriptionally transferrin receptor mRNA stability and ferritin mRNA translation. By using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the sequence published by Rouault et al. (1990) a probe was derived which permitted the isolation of three human IRF cDNA clones. Hybridization to genomic DNA and mRNA, as well as sequencing data indicated a single copy gene of about 40 kb specifying a 4.0 kb mRNA that translates into a protein of 98,400 dalton. By in vitro transcription of a assembled IRF cDNA coupled to in vitro translation in a wheat germ extract, we obtained full sized IRF that bound specifically to a human ferritin IRE. In vitro translated IRF retained sensitivity to sulfhydryl oxidation by diamide and could be reactivated by beta-mercaptoethanol in the same way as native placental IRF. An IRF deletion mutant shortened by 132 amino acids at the COOH-terminus was no longer able to bind to an IRE, indicating that this region of the protein plays a role in RNA recognition. Placental IRF has previously been shown to migrate as a doublet on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After V8 protease digestion the heterogeneity was located in a 65/70 kDa NH2-terminal doublet. The liberated 31 kDa COOH-terminal polypeptide was found to be homogeneous by amino acid sequencing supporting the conclusion of a single IRF gene."
"7055796","articletitle","Molecular basis for increased synthesis of albumin in rat liver after thioacetamide administration."
"7055796","abstracttext","Administration of thioacetamide to rats for 4 days has been shown previously to increase the activity of liver messenger RNA (mRNA) and to disproportionately increase the activity of albumin mRNA in the wheat germ translation system. We have explored the possibility that administration of thioacetamide quantitatively alters the transcription of rat liver unique DNA. Nucleic acid hybridization between the radioactive rat liver unique DNA and RNA from untreated as well as 4-day thioacetamide-treated rat liver indicates that the normal extent of transcription is not altered by the drug treatment. We also investigated the possibility that thioacetamide treatment increases the level of mRNA in general or of albumin mRNA in particular. Albumin mRNA, which is th most abundantly represented population in rat liver cytoplasmic mRNA, was further enriched by sucrose gradient fractionation of the liver mRNA. Synthesis of complementary DNA (cDNA) and then use of the strategy of limited hybridization yielded the cDNA corresponding to albumin mRNA. Hybridization of the fractionated cDNA with mRNA from untreated livers as well as from livers with increasing days of treatment shows no change in the level of albumin mRNA. The results indicate that drug treatment induces the augmented synthesis of albumin by disproportionately increasing the translational activity of albumin mRNA. Quantitation of gene dosage by comparison of hybridization kinetics of fractionated cDNA and unique [3H]DNA with total rat cellular DNA indicates that there are not more than two copies of the albumin gene present in the rat genome."
"6940141","articletitle","Cell surface modulation of gene expression in brain cells by down regulation of glucocorticoid receptors."
"6940141","abstracttext","The concentration of glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH; sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD(+) 2-oxidoreductase, EC 1.1.1.8) had previously been determined to be regulated by glucocorticoids in rat brain cells in vivo and in cell culture. We now demonstrate that concanavalin A (Con A) can inhibit the induction of GPDH in dose-dependent manner in C6 rat glioma cells and in primary cultures of rat brain oligodendrocytes. Con A is not cytotoxic, because its effect can be prevented or reversed by alpha-methyl mannoside. The inhibition specifically prevents the appearance of new molecules of GPDH, although Con A does not significantly inhibit protein synthesis in these cells, nor does it affect the activity of another soluble enzyme, lactate dehydrogenase. The ability to block enzyme induction is not limited to Con A, because other lectins also inhibit induction, with Ricinus communis agglutinin 60 being the most potent (50% inhibition of induction at 0.0083 muM) and wheat germ agglutinin being the least potent (50% inhibition of induction at 1.2 muM). The molecular mechanism by which Con A inhibits GPDH induction appears to be by the ""down regulation"" of the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptors, because exposure to Con A results in the loss of more than 90% of the receptor activity. Con A does not inhibit the receptor assay and no direct interaction between the receptor and Con A could be demonstrated. This down regulation is not tumor cell specific and appears to be a general phenomenon, because it occurs in normal oligodendrocytes and even in normal astrocytes (a cell type in which the gene for GPDH is not expressed). The down regulation of glucocorticoid receptors in normal brain cells suggests two important corollaries. First, it demonstrates the existence of a rate-limiting step controlling the glucocorticoid-dependent gene expression in brain cells and possibly represents a regulatory site common to all glucocorticoid target cells. Second, it suggests that the response to glucocorticoids of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can be regulated in vivo by cell surface contact with endogenous lectins, neighboring cells, or both."

"2925674","abstracttext","Synthesis of a relatively rare glycoprotein (germin) signals the onset of growth in germinating wheat embryos. Germin mRNA (1075 nucleotide residues) has an 85-residue 5'-untranslated sequence, a 69-residue sequence that can encode a 23-residue signal-peptide sequence, a 603-residue sequence that can encode a 201-residue mature-protein sequence, and a 318-residue 3'-untranslated sequence that begins with a UAA-terminator codon, ends with a 63-residue polyadenylate tract, and has three polyadenylation (and other, related) signals (AAUAAN etc.). One polyadenylation signal is just 9 nucleotides from the polyadenylation site, the shortest stretch of nucleotides yet found between polyadenylation signal and site in any animal or plant mRNA. The mature-protein coding sequence in germin mRNA contains an unusually high proportion (87%) of G + C in the third positions of its codons. The amino acid sequence of germin does not have extensive internal homologies or repetitions, and it is not characterized by regions of unusually high charge density, as is nucleoplasmin, another water-soluble homopentameric protein with otherwise closely related structural properties. Germin does, however, contain a stretch of 34 uncharged amino acid residues and these may possibly mediate its homopentameric structure and its remarkable resistance to enzymic proteolysis. In view of a possible association of germin with cellular membranes, the most interesting relatedness of the germin sequence to the sequences of other proteins is an 80% homology between a decapeptide sequence in mature germin and a decapeptide sequence in Escherichia coli glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase. The relation of germin-gene structure to overall gene regulation during early plant growth is discussed."

"3464811","abstracttext","In order to characterize certain aspects of gene expression during the granulocytic differentiation of the HL60 cell line, we have analysed changes in the population of mRNA available for translation in vitro. RNA extracts of DMSO-induced and control cells were translated in vitro in a wheat germ cell-free protein synthesizing system. Translation products were analysed by two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by autoradiography. Autoradiograms were analysed by a computer-assisted method utilizing a drum-scanning microdensitometer. Spots were identified by their relative positions on the films and their relative intensity was estimated. One hundred and eighty-one peptides were identified in both the DMSO-induced and untreated control HL60 cells, 31 of which showed differentiation-associated changes in synthesis in vitro. The 11 peptides which decreased in synthesis did so early in the differentiation process, whereas most of the 20 peptides which increased did so at a later time. Three peptides were shown to increase more than 8-fold by day 4 of induction. A comparison with normal granule proteins from human leukocytes suggests that at least two of these may correspond to functional granule proteins. The changes in peptide patterns which we describe demonstrates that the program of gene expression during HL60 differentiation includes changes in the relative abundance of specific mRNA transcripts. The data described here also provides a standard for comparison of other proteins, such as oncogene products, as they are identified."

"7579187","abstracttext","Sequence analysis of a 1.33 kb clone from a root cDNA library of Nicotiana rustica revealed an open reading frame encoding a protein of 356 amino acids. The deduced protein has high levels of homology to human cathepsin B protease and a cathepsin B-like cysteine protease from wheat but much lower levels of homology with other plant cysteine proteinases. Southern blotting experiments suggest a limited number of cathepsin B-like genes are present in the genome of N. rustica and also that of N. tabacum. RNA analysis involving a range of tissues, harvested from both Nicotiana species 4-5 h after the beginning of a 16 h photoperiod, revealed the cathepsin B-like gene was being expressed strongly in roots, stem and developing flowers but weakly in mature leaves. Further analysis of RNA extracted from leaf tissue of N. tabacum revealed the gene showed rhythmic expression and also that its expression increased in response to wounding. Analysis of leaf tissues harvested during the latter part of a 16 h photoperiod (11 and 16 h after illumination commenced) showed that transcript levels were two three times higher than in leaf tissue harvested either towards the end of the dark period or 5 h after illumination commenced. When leaf tissue was wounded at 11:00 (5 h after plants were illuminated), and harvested for RNA extraction 6 h later, the level of cathepsin B-like transcript in mesophyll tissue was found to be increased ca. 2-fold relative to the level detected in unwounded controls."

"6806362","abstracttext","The synthesis of lambda light chains and the arrangement of the lambda-chain genes was examined in cells of the mouse myeloma MOPC 315, which is an alpha lambda 2 producer, and in several mutants derived from it. The mutants produce lambda 2 chains only (MOPC 315.26, MOPC 315.34, and MOPC 315.37) or fail to produce alpha and lambda 2 chains (MOPC 315.25 and MOPC 315.36). Messenger RNA from the lambda 2 chain-producing cells directed the synthesis of a lambda 2 chain precursor and a fragment of the lambda 1 chain (lambda 1 F) in a wheat embryo cellfree system, whereas mRNA from the cells that do not produce lambda 2 chains directed the synthesis of lambda 1 F only. DNA from the parental MOPC 315 cells and from the lambda 2 chain-producing cells contained discrete EcoRI restriction fragments coding for rearranged lambda 1 and lambda 23 chain genes and their respective germ-line V and J-C regions. DNA from the no-Ig-producing cells contained fragments coding for the rearranged lambda 1 chain gene and the germ-line V lambda 2 region, but it lacked the sequences coding for the rearranged lambda 2 chain gene and the germ-line V lambda 1 and J-C lambda 1 regions. These results suggest that rearrangements of the lambda 1 and lambda 2 chain genes occur on different chromosomes in MOPC 315 cells and imply that rearrangements of the lambda 1 and lambda 2 chain genes on the same chromosome may be mutually exclusive."

"6688781","abstracttext","The induction of cytochrome P450 in chick embryo liver has been studied using three different porphyrinogenic drugs, 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide, 3,5-diethoxycarbonyl-1,4-dihydrocollidine and phenobarbital. Pulse-labelling studies have shown that for each drug the cytochrome P450 synthesized either in ovo or in a wheat germ translation system reacted immunologically with antibody raised against the purified 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide-induced enzyme (Mr = 50000). To investigate whether this is due to the three drugs inducing the same protein or different proteins with common immunological determinants, nucleic acid hybridization studies have been carried out using a recently characterised 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide-induced cytochrome P450 cloned cDNA probe [Brooker, J. D. et al. (1982) Eur. J. Biochem. 129, 325-333]. It has been shown that the mRNA induced by each drug hybridizes with this probe and all are of similar size. The melting profile of the mRNA . cDNA hybrids indicates that the mRNAs induced by the three drugs have at least 98% homology with the cDNA probe. Restriction endonuclease digestions of total chick embryo genomal DNA and a chick cytochrome P450 genomal clone indicates that the cytochrome P450 gene homologous with the cDNA probe is represented in the genome only once. These results strongly suggest that the three drugs cause increased levels of the same cytochrome P450 mRNA, possibly due to enhanced expression of the same gene. Results are also presented which show that other cytochrome-P450-inducing drugs, 3-methylcholanthrene, beta-naphthoflavone or pregnenolone-16 alpha-carbonitrile do not increase the level of the 2-allyl-2-isopropylacetamide-inducible mRNA but rather reduce it to a level which was lower than that of the untreated controls."

"8281190","abstracttext","Clones for three barley non-specific lipid transfer proteins (LTP2, LTP3, and LTP4; formerly Cw18, Cw20 and Cw21, respectively) which had been previously shown to inhibit growth of plant pathogens, were selected and characterized from a cDNA library derived from young etiolated leaves. Genes Ltp2 and Ltp4 were located in chromosome 3H and gene Ltp3 was assigned to chromosome 7H by Southern blot analysis of wheat-barley disomic addition lines, using gene-specific probes (3'-ends of cDNAs). These assignments were confirmed by the polymerase chain reaction, using specific primers. The three genes were expressed in stem, shoot apex, leaves and roots (at low levels) throughout development. Genes Ltp3 and Ltp4 were expressed at high levels, and Lpt2 at low levels, in the spike (rachis, lemma plus palea and grain coats). Neither of the mRNAs was detected in endosperm. The proteins were localized by tissue-printing with polyclonal antibodies in the outer cell layer of the exposed surfaces of the plant, throughout the embryo, and in vascular tissues. Expression levels in leaves were moderately increased by 0.34 M NaCl and by 0.1 mM abscisic acid and were not affected by cold, drought, salicylate, 2,6-dichloro-isonicotinic acid, ethylene or ethephon. Methyl Jasmonate (10 microM) switched off all three genes. Inoculation with Av6 or vir6 isolates of the fungal pathogen Erysiphe graminis increased the three mRNAs, especially that of LTP4, which reached a maximum nine-fold increase 12-16 h after infection."

"8526497","abstracttext","Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0 produces several secondary metabolites, e.g., the antibiotics pyoluteorin (Plt) and 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (Phl), which are important for the suppression of root diseases caused by soil-borne fungal pathogens. A Tn5 insertion mutant of strain CHA0, CHA625, does not produce Phl, shows enhanced Plt production on malt agar, and has lost part of the ability to suppress black root rot in tobacco plants and take-all in wheat. We used a rapid, two-step cloning-out procedure for isolating the wild-type genes corresponding to those inactivated by the Tn5 insertion in strain CHA625. This cloning method should be widely applicable to bacterial genes tagged with Tn5. The region cloned from P. fluorescens contained three complete open reading frames. The deduced gene products, designated PqqFAB, showed extensive similarities to proteins involved in the biosynthesis of pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and Methylobacterium extorquens. PQQ-negative mutants of strain CHA0 were constructed by gene replacement. They lacked glucose dehydrogenase activity, could not utilize ethanol as a carbon source, and showed a strongly enhanced production of Plt on malt agar. These effects were all reversed by complementation with pqq+ recombinant plasmids. The growth of a pqqF mutant on ethanol and normal Plt production were restored by the addition of 16 nM PQQ. However, the Phl- phenotype of strain CHA625 was due not to the pqq defect but presumably to a secondary mutation. In conclusion, a lack of PQQ markedly stimulates the production of Plt in P. fluorescens."

"8510647","abstracttext","We report identification of a 2189 bp cDNA clone from barley corresponding to a single-copy gene, Beg1 (Barley embryo globulin), on chromosome 4, which encodes a storage globulin. In barley, the major protein reserve in the aleurone layer belongs to the 7S globulin class of proteins found in many seeds. Electrophoretically and antigenically similar proteins are present in the barley embryo. Accumulation of Beg1 mRNA was noted beginning 15-20 days post-anthesis in both the aleurone layer and embryo of the developing barley grain but not in the starchy endosperm. A high level of Beg1 mRNA is also present in the mature imbibed aleurones, which can be repressed by treatment with gibberellic acid. This repressive effect of gibberellin on the levels of Beg1 mRNA is confirmed in the gibberellin response-constitutive mutant, slender, whose aleurone layers do not accumulate Beg1 mRNA even in the absence of applied gibberellic acid. The deduced primary translation product of the Beg1 mRNA is a 63.7 amino acid (72 kDa) protein with homology to maize embryo globulin 1 (GLB1) and a partial sequence of a wheat 7S globulin. The internal amino acid sequence of BEG1 closely matches the N-terminal sequence of isolated barley aleurone globulin. Seven imperfect tandem repeats of 16 amino acids each are present near the N-terminus of BEG1, which conform to the consensus HGEGEREEEXGRGRGR, and contribute to the observed unusual amino acid composition of this protein. A second, distinct barley globulin gene, Beg2, which is homologous to maize Glb2, was detected by Northern and Southern analysis. Beg2 and Beg1 are regulated differently which may indicate variation in storage or utilization properties among the barley globulins."

"8172598","abstracttext","A Neocallimastix patriciarum cDNA library was screened for xylanase-expressing clones, which were distinct from the previously characterized N. patriciarum xynA cDNA encoding xylanase A. A single cDNA, designated xynB, which did not exhibit homology with xynA, was isolated. Northern-blot analysis of mRNA from Avicel-grown N. patriciarum showed that xynB hybridized to a 3.4 kb mRNA species. The nucleotide sequence of xynB revealed a single open reading frame of 2580 bp coding for a protein designated xylanase B (XYLB), of M(r) 88,066. The primary structure of XYLB was comprised of a 21-residue N-terminal signal peptide, followed by a 304-amino acid sequence that exhibited substantial homology with the catalytic domains of family F xylanases. The N-terminal domain was linked to a C-terminal 70-residue sequence by a putative linker region, comprising 12 tandem repeats of a sequence containing TLPG as the core sequence, followed by an octapeptide XSKTLPGG where X can be S, K or N, which was repeated in tandem 45 times. Truncated derivatives of xynB encoding the N-terminal 338 residues directed the synthesis of a functional xylanase, confirming that the region of XYLB, which exhibited homology with family F xylanases, constitutes the catalytic domain. To investigate the catalytic properties of XYLB, the catalytic domain was fused to the Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein, and the fusion protein purified by amylose affinity chromatography. The purified enzyme hydrolysed oat, rye and wheat arabinoxylan releasing primarily xylobiose, xylotriose and some xylose. The XYLB fusion did not cleave any cellulosic substrates. The data presented in this report suggest that the multiple xylanases of N. patriciarum arose, not through the duplication of a single gene, but by the transfer of distinct xylanase-encoding DNA sequences into the anaerobic fungus. The possible origin of the xynB gene is discussed."

"8114827","abstracttext","Antibodies against Leishmania major wheat germ agglutinin-binding glycoproteins were used to select from a genomic lambda gt11 expression library a clone coding for a L. major glycoprotein. The partial DNA sequence indicated the presence of a mosaic of repetitive sequences. Southern blot hybridisation on genomic DNA using the cloned gene as a probe at high stringency suggested a single gene, which was localised to chromosome band 18. Northern blot analysis of L. major mRNA detected a major transcript of 7.5 kb and a minor 4.0-kb transcript. Antibodies affinity-purified on the fusion protein identified a complex of two water-soluble cytoplasmic polypeptides of approximately 96 kDa and 92 kDa in L. major promastigotes and amastigotes. They also recognised polypeptides in other Leishmania species, in Crithidia lucilliae and very weakly in Leptomonas. The apparent molecular weight of these polypeptides, while conserved within each species, varied between species. A peptide map of the two polypeptides from L. major generated an identical pattern suggesting a close relatedness at the protein level. This protein complex was not hydrolysed by N-glycanase and was not affected by tunicamycin, but treatment with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride suggested that it is O-glycosylated. The glycan moiety appears to be N-acetylglucosamine, and N-acetylglucosamine beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase was capable of adding [3H]galactose to it. This was susceptible to beta elimination and beta-galactosidase treatment. Taken together, the data indicates that gp96/92 belongs to the newly described class of cytoplasmic and nuclear glycoproteins containing O-linked N-acetylglucosamine."

"8647807","abstracttext","Covalent modification of proteins by attachment of multiubiquitin chains serves as an essential signal for selective protein degradation in eukaryotes. The specificity of ubiquitin-protein conjugation is controlled in part by a diverse group of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s or UBCs). We have previously reported that the product of the wheat TaUBC7 gene recognizes ubiquitin as a substrate for ubiquitination in vitro, catalyzing the condensation of free ubiquitin into multiubiquitin chains linked via lysine 48 (van Nocker, S., and vierstra, R. D. (1991) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 88, 10297-10301). Based on this activity, this E2 may play a central role in the ubiquitin proteolytic pathway by assembling chains in vivo. Here, we describe the cloning and characterization of a three-member gene family from Arabidopsis thaliana (designated AtUBC7/13/14) encoding structural homologs of TaUBC7. Like TaUBC7, recombinant AtUBC7/13/14 proteins formed multiubiquitin chains in vitro. AtUBC7/13/14 mRNAs were found in all tissues examined, and unlike related UBCs from yeast, the levels of mRNA were not elevated by heat stress or cadmium exposure. Transgenic Arabidopsis were engineered to express increased levels of active AtUBC7, for the first time altering the level of an E2 in a higher eukaryote. Plants expressing high levels of AtUBC7 exhibited no phenotypic abnormalities and were not noticeably enriched in multiubiquitinated conjugates. These findings indicate that the in vivo synthesis of multiubiquitin chains is not rate-limited by the abundance of AtUC7 and/or involves other, yet undefined components."
"9784234","articletitle","A highly active protein repair enzyme from an extreme thermophile: the L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase from Thermotoga maritima."
"9784234","abstracttext","We show that the open reading frame in the Thermotoga maritima genome tentatively identified as the pcm gene (R. V. Swanson et al., J. Bacteriol. 178, 484-489, 1996) does indeed encode a protein L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.77) and that this protein repair enzyme displays several novel features. We expressed the 317 amino acid pcm gene product of this thermophilic bacterium in Escherichia coli as a fusion protein with an N-terminal 20 residue hexa-histidine-containing sequence. This protein contains a C-terminal domain of approximately 100 residues not previously seen in this enzyme from various prokaryotic or eukaryotic species and which does not have sequence similarity to any other entry in the GenBank databases. The C-terminal region appears to be required for enzymatic function as no activity is detected in two recombinant constructs lacking this domain. Sedimentation equilibrium analysis indicated that the enzyme is monomeric in solution. The Km values for measured for peptide and protein substrates were found to be intermediate between those of the high-affinity human enzyme and those of the lower-affinity wheat, nematode, and E. coli enzymes. The enzyme was extremely heat stable, with no loss of activity after 60 min at 100 degreesC. Enzyme activity was observed at temperatures as high as 93 degreesC with an optimal activity of 164 nmol/min/mg protein at 85 degreesC. This activity is approximately 18-fold higher than the maximal activities of mesophilic homologs at 37 degreesC. These data suggest that the Thermotoga enzyme has unique features for initiating repair in damaged proteins containing L-isoaspartyl residues at elevated temperatures."
"9363991","articletitle","Suppression of intestinal polyp development by low-fat and high-fiber diet in Apc(delta716) knockout mice."
"9363991","abstracttext","Most epidemiological and animal studies show a positive correlation of the dietary intake of fat with the incidence of colon cancer, whereas an inverse correlation of the dietary intake of fiber. In rats fed a diet low in fat and high in wheat bran fiber and calcium, a significant decrease was reported in the number of azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci compared with those fed a high-fat, low-fiber and low-calcium diet. Mutations in the human APC gene play a key role, not only in familial adenomatous polyposis, but also in many sporadic cancers of the entire digestive tract. We previously constructed a mouse strain Apc(delta716), carrying a truncation mutation at codon 716 of the Apc gene, the homolog of human APC (10). The heterozygous mice developed numerous intestinal polyps, and all microadenomas dissected from the earliest polyps had already lost the wild-type allele, indicating the loss of heterozygosity. Using these Apc(delta716) knockout mice, we have investigated the effect of a low-fat and high-fiber diet (LRD for 'low-risk' diet) on intestinal polyposis, and compared it with that of a high-fat and low-fiber diet (HRD for 'high-risk' diet). The mice were fed either diet for 7 weeks, and the number and size of intestinal polyps were scored. The LRD-fed mice had fewer polyps than the HRD-fed mice, by 36% in the small intestine and by 64% in the colon. As for the polyp size distribution, there was no significant difference between the HRD- and LRD-fed mice. These results indicate that LRD can suppress intestinal polyposis compared with HRD which does not, and suggest that its suppression is at the initiation of polyp formation. This is likely to be due to a decreased frequency of loss of heterozygosity, rather than a retarded growth of the polyp adenomas."

"11031088","abstracttext","Spinal cord injury in adult mammals results in little axonal regeneration, although the mechanism of regeneration failure still remains elusive. Recent research has revealed that activation of the extracellular-signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) plays an important role in the neurite outgrowth. In the present study, we constructed a replication-defective adenovirus vector carrying mutated form of MEK1 (CA-MEK virus), which constitutively activate ERK pathway, and investigated its effect on thoracic spinal cord injury model in young adult rats as well as neurite outgrowth in vitro. In rat pheocromocytoma cell line PC12 cells, CA-MEK virus infection induced sustained activation of ERKs and stimulated neurite outgrowth in the absence of neurotrophic factors. In rat spinal cord transection model, injection of CA-MEK virus into the completely transected spinal cord efficiently activated ERKs in the supraspinal neurons and induced axonal regeneration across the transection site, which was confirmed by anterograde labeling with wheat-germ-agglutinin conjugated peroxidase (WGA-HRP). Spinal cord evoked potentials (SCEP) showed that these regenerated axons were electroconductive. Most importantly, CA-MEK virus-treated rats showed significant recovery of hind limb function 2 weeks after operation compared to the control rats treated with no virus or LacZ virus. These results suggest that adenovirus-mediated CA-MEK gene transduction offers a novel strategy for the gene therapy of spinal cord injury."

"11029703","abstracttext","Arginine decarboxylase (ADC; EC 4.1.1.9) is a key enzyme in polyamine biosynthesis in plants. We characterized a carnation genomic clone, gDcADC8, in which the deduced polypeptide of ADC was 725 amino acids with a molecular mass of 77.7 kDa. The unusually long 5'-UTR that contained a short upstream open reading frame (uORF) of seven amino acids (MQKSLHI) was predicted to form an extensive secondary structure (free energy of approximately -117 kcal mol-1) using the Zuker m-fold algorithm. The result that an ADC antibody detected two bands of 45 and 33 kDa in a petal extract suggested the full length of the 78 kDa polypeptide precursor converted into two polypeptides in the processing reaction. To investigate the role of the transcript leader in translation, in vitro transcription/translation reactions with various constructs of deletion and mutation were performed using wheat germ extract. The ADC transcript leader affected positively downstream translation in both wheatgerm extract and primary transformant overexpressing ADC gene. It was demonstrated that heptapeptide (8.6 kDa) encoded by the ADC uORF was synthesized in vitro. Both uORF peptide, and the synthetic heptapeptide MQKSLHI of the uORF, repressed the translation of downstream ORF. Mutation of the uORF ATG codon alleviated the inhibitory effect. ORF translation was not affected by either a frame-shift mutation in uORF or a random peptide. To our knowledge, this is the first report to provide evidence that a uORF may inhibit the translation of a downstream ORF, not only in cis but also in trans, and that the leader sequence of the ADC gene is important for efficient translation."

"11057760","abstracttext","In present study the methylotrophic yeast, Pichia pastoris, was used to express a recombinant growth hormone (rGH) gene of swine. A synthetic secretion cassette was constructed using the promoter of the alcohol oxidase1 gene (AOX1), and a alpha-factor signal peptide. After electroporatic transformation and zeocin selection, several clones exhibited high levels of rGH protein expression constituting more than 20% of total yeast protein. Over 95% of rGH was shown to be export into the culture supernatant. Yeast transformant containing the highest recombinant growth hormone level (rGH yeast) and native GS115 Pichia pastoris (non-rGH yeast, as a control) were separately cultured, harvested and adsorbed by wheat bran. Yeast cultures of four dosages (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4%) were mixed respectively with chick basal diet and fed to simulated country chickens for 9 weeks. The results showed that, when compared to control chicks, the percentage of body weight gain was improved significantly (P<0.05) in chicks fed with diets containing 0.1 or 0.2% rGH-rich yeast culture at brooding stage, and in chicks fed with 0.4% rGH-rich yeast culture at growing stage. The average weight gain in rGH yeast treated groups for the full-term (0 to 63d) and short term (43 to 63d) of growth were 10.6 and 9.4%, respectively, better than the non-rGH yeast control group. These experimental data suggest that the use of rGH-containing yeast as a supplement in fed provided an alternative approach for growth improvement in simulated country chickens."

"10579488","abstracttext","We have identified a limited number of proteins secreted into the nectar of tobacco plants. Nectarin I is the most highly expressed nectar protein and has a monomer molecular mass of 29 kDa. The other major nectar proteins are expressed at lower levels and have monomer molecular masses of 41, 54, and 65 kDa respectively. Nectarin I was purified and antiserum was raised against the protein. Under nondenaturing conditions, Nectarin I has an apparent molecular mass of > 120 kDa. The expression of Nectarin I was restricted to nectary tissues and to a much lower level in the ovary. No Nectarin I was found in petals, stems, leaves, or roots or other floral tissues. The expression of Nectarin I was also developmentally regulated. It is expressed in nectary tissues only while nectar is being actively secreted. Subsequently, the N-terminus of purified Nectarin I was sequenced. Sequence identity showed Nectarin I is related to wheat germin. Although hydrogen peroxide is readily detectable in tobacco floral nectar, we were unable to demonstrate any oxalate oxidase activity for Nectarin I. A partial cDNA encoding the mature Nectarin I N-terminus was isolated and used to probe a Nicotiana plumbaginifolia genomic library. The Nectarin I gene was isolated and the translated sequence was consistent with both N-terminal and internal cyanogen bromide-derived amino acid sequence. The gene contains a single 386 nt intron and encodes a mature protein of 197 amino acids."

"10749734","abstracttext","A mutation in the delta-sarcoglycan (SG) gene with absence of delta-SG protein in the heart has been identified in the BIO14.6 cardiomyopathic (CM) hamster, but how the defective gene leads to myocardial degeneration and dysfunction is unknown. We correlated left ventricular (LV) function with increased sarcolemmal membrane permeability and investigated the LV distribution of the dystrophin-dystroglycan complex in BIO14.6 CM hamsters. On echocardiography at 5 wk of age, the CM hamsters showed a mildly enlarged diastolic dimension (LVDD) with decreased LV percent fractional shortening (%FS), and at 9 wk further enlargement of LVDD with reduction of %FS was observed. The percent area of myocardium exhibiting increased membrane permeability or membrane rupture, assessed by Evans blue dye (EBD) staining and wheat germ agglutinin, was greater at 9 than at 5 wk. In areas not stained by EBD, immunostaining of dystrophin was detected in CM hamsters at sarcolemma and T tubules, as expected, but it was also abnormally expressed at the intercalated discs; in addition, the expression of beta-dystroglycan was significantly reduced compared with control hearts. As previously described, alpha-SG was completely deficient in CM hearts compared with control hearts. In myocardial areas showing increased sarcolemmal permeability, neither dystrophin nor beta-dystroglycan could be identified by immunolabeling. Thus, together with the known loss of delta-SG and other SGs, abnormal distribution of dystrophin and reduction of beta-dystroglycan are associated with increased sarcolemmal permeability followed by cell rupture, which correlates with early progressive cardiac dysfunction in the BIO14.6 CM hamster."

"11708829","abstracttext","The development of the representation of differential expression method has lead to the cloning of Trypanosoma cruzi stage-specific genes. We used this method to characterize a multicopy gene family differentially expressed during metacyclogenesis. The genomic and cDNA clones sequenced encoded three short cysteine-rich polypeptides, of two types, with predicted molecular masses of 7.1, 10.4, and 10.8 kDa. We searched GenBank for similar sequences and found that the sequences of these clones were similar to that encoding the wheat germ agglutinin protein. The region of similarity corresponds to the chitin-binding domain, with eight similarly positioned half-cysteines and conserved aromatic residues involved in chitin recognition. Multiple copies of the genes of this family are present on a high- molecular-mass chromosome. We studied the expression of genes of this family during metacyclogenesis by determining messenger RNA (mRNA) levels. The mRNAs for the members of this gene family were present in the total RNA fraction but were mobilized to the polysomal fraction of adhered (differentiating) epimastigotes during metacyclogenesis, with a peak of accumulation at 24 of differentiation. Polyclonal antisera were raised against a recombinant protein and a synthetic peptide. The specific sera obtained detected 7- and 11-kDa proteins in T. cruzi total protein extracts. The 11-kDa protein was present in similar amounts in the various cell populations, whereas the 7-kDa protein displayed differential synthesis during metacyclogenesis, with maximal levels in 24-h-adhered (differentiating) epimastigotes."

"11720789","abstracttext","The bradykinin B(1) receptor has been considered as an important mediator for inflammatory pain. In the present study, we have investigated the fibre types of sciatic nerve primary sensory neurones that express B(1) receptors by retrograde tracing in combination with immunohistochemical staining, or double-immunohistochemical staining. Approximately 12% of the A-fibre dorsal root ganglion neurones, retrogradely labelled from an intra-sciatic nerve injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit, were B(1) receptor-immunoreactive. Over 70% of the small diameter dorsal root ganglion neurones, retrogradely labelled from an intra-sciatic nerve injection of tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin, were B(1) receptor-immunoreactive. Over 50% of the (predominantly non-peptidergic) C-fibre dorsal root ganglion neurones, retrogradely labelled from an intra-sciatic nerve injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Bandeiraea simplicifolia isolectin B4, were B(1) receptor-immunoreactive. When calcitonin gene-related peptide, which is contained mainly in small caliber C- and A(delta)-fibre primary afferents, and B(1) receptors were stained with a double-immunofluorescent method, over 80% of the calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive dorsal root ganglion neurones were B(1) receptor-immunoreactive. From these results we suggest that B(1) receptors are predominantly expressed by small diameter primary afferent neurones that give rise to sciatic nerve fibres, which include both peptidergic and non-peptidergic C-fibres and A(delta)-fibres. Since peripheral nociceptive information is primarily transmitted by C- and A(delta)-fibres, B(1) receptors may be involved in the modulation of nociceptive transduction or transmission."
"15668792","articletitle","Isolation and characterization of a Ds-tagged rice (Oryza sativa L.) GA-responsive dwarf mutant defective in an early step of the gibberellin biosynthesis pathway."
"15668792","abstracttext","We have isolated a severe dwarf transposon (Ds) insertion mutant in rice (Oryza sativa L.), which could be differentiated early in the seedling stage by reduced shoot growth and dark green leaves, and later by severe dwarfism and failure to initiate flowering. These mutants, however, showed normal seed germination and root growth. One of the sequences flanking Ds, rescued from the mutant, was of a chromosome 4-located putative ent-kaurene synthase (KS) gene, encoding the enzyme catalyzing the second step of the gibberellin (GA) biosynthesis pathway. Dwarf mutants were always homozygous for this Ds insertion and no normal plants homozygous for this mutation were recovered in the segregating progeny, indicating that the Ds insertion mutation is recessive. As mutations in three recently reported rice GA-responsive dwarf mutant alleles and the dwarf mutation identified in this study mapped to the same locus, we designate the corresponding gene OsKS1. The osks1 mutant seedlings were responsive to exogenous gibberellin (GA3). OsKS1 transcripts of about 2.3 kb were detected in leaves and stem of wild-type plants, but not in germinating seeds or roots, suggesting that OsKS1 is not involved in germination or root growth. There are at least five OsKS1-like genes in the rice genome, four of which are also represented in rice expressed sequence tag (EST) databases. All OsKS1-like genes are transcribed with different expression patterns. ESTs corresponding to all six OsKS genes are represented in other cereal databases including barley, wheat and maize, suggesting that they are biologically active."

"12125999","abstracttext","The trachea whole organ perfusion technique was used to study the effect of the disruption of the Streptococcus pneumoniae neuraminidase nanA gene on bacterial adherence and alteration of the carbohydrate surface structures of respiratory epithelial cells. Six different lectin probes were used to examine alterations of the cell surface carbohydrates in chinchilla tracheal epithelium incubated in vitro with S. pneumoniae deltaNA1, a neuraminidase-deficient mutant, or its D39 parent strain. The labeling pattern revealed that the binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin II (BSL II) and succinylated WGA was significantly increased in the luminal surface of the trachea in the D39-incubated cohort compared with the uninfected control, which indicated that GlcNAc and D-galactose residues were exposed. Concurrently, decreased labeling with Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) indicated that there were few sialic acid residues remaining in the tracheal epithelium subsequent to incubation with D39. The deltaNA1 neuraminidase-deficient mutant, however, did not induce any significant changes in the lectin labeling patterns, which were comparable to those of the control cohort. Moreover, adherence data expressed as colony-forming units (CFU) of S. pneumoniae per millimeter of trachea indicated a significant decline in the ability of deltaNA1 to adhere in vitro. We propose that products of the nanA gene have a significant impact on changes in the carbohydrate moieties in the tracheal epithelium, and may be responsible for the previously reported increased ability of the D39 parent to colonize the nasopharynx and invade the middle ear."

"12021846","abstracttext","Through recent government- and industry-sponsored efforts, several forward and reverse genetic screening programs have emerged over the past few years to aid in the genetic dissection of gene function in maize. Despite a US maize crop valued at $18.4 billion last year (http://www.ncga.com/03world/main/US_crop_value_2000.html) and rich genetic history, maize has taken a back seat to Arabidopsis thaliana as the model genetic system for plants over the past decade. With a fully sequenced genome, short generation time and small size, studies of Arabidopsis have provided plant scientists with a molecular framework for hormonal, developmental and environmental signaling pathways in plants. As investigations into Arabidopsis continue, our capacity to engineer biochemical pathways and alter plant physiological responses will become increasingly sophisticated. Nevertheless, approximately 130 million years have passed since monocot and higher eudicot lineages diverged. Thus, our ability to engineer agronomically important monocot grasses such as maize, rice and wheat will become increasingly limited by our lack of understanding of the physiological and morphological differences that have evolved in the monocots and higher eudicots. The sophisticated transposon collections now being generated for maize are but one of several recent projects (http://www.nsf.gov/bio/pubs/awards/genome01.htm) to provide grass researchers with essential tools for genome analysis. Because grain crops are such a closely related group, it is hoped that many of the findings made in one grass will be directly applicable to understanding the biology of another. The goal of this review is to highlight the recent developments in maize transposon-based gene characterization programs and provide a critical examination of the advantages and disadvantages each system offers."

"12032605","abstracttext","The growth of Pseudomonas aureofaciens PGS12 was followed in nutrient broth (NB), on nutrient agar (NA), and on plant roots by monitoring cell numbers, the production of the autoinducer hexanoyl-homoserine lactone (HHL), and the antibiotic phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA). In NB, as the growth rate declined in transition phase, HHL synthesis increased rapidly, shortly followed by PCA production. During stationary phase, HHL concentration declined rapidly while PCA concentration continued to increase slowly. The luxAB reporter genes were inserted in the phzB gene of the phenazine operon and phenazine transcriptional activity was monitored using measurement of luminescence. Levels and pattern of light output were similar to HHL accumulation and indicated that gene expression was maximal in transition phase and silenced in stationary phase. PCA production continued in stationary phase, suggesting that the protein products of the phenazine operon were maintained in the cell after down regulation. HHL accumulation was 60 times higher on NA than in NB per equivalent volume because of a 60-fold increase in cell density on NA. Higher levels of PCA per cell (6.8 times) and per equivalent volume (360-fold) accumulated in a colony compared to that found in broth. HHL remained at a high concentration in a colony for a longer period compared to a short burst in NB, and this may explain the increased PCA production. In contrast, on wheat seedlings and bean plant roots, bacterial growth was observed, but neither HHL nor PCA was detected; however, transcriptional activity of the phzB::luxAB reporter occurred on the bean plant roots."

"12036279","abstracttext","A molecular genetic map was constructed and an electrophoretic karyotype was resolved for Cochliobolus sativus, the causal agent of spot blotch of barley and wheat. The genetic map consists of 27 linkage groups with 97 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers, 31 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers, two polymerase chain reaction amplified markers, the mating type locus (CsMAT), and a gene (VHv1) conditioning high virulence on barley cv. Bowman. These linkage groups covered a map distance of 849 cM. The virulence gene VHv1 cosegregated with six AFLP markers and was mapped on one of the major linkage groups. Fifteen chromosome-sized DNAs were resolved in C. sativus isolates ND93-1 and ND9OPr with contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF) electrophoresis combined with telomere probe analysis of comigrating chromosome-sized DNAs. The chromosome sizes ranged from 1.25 to 3.80 Mbp, and the genome size of the fungus was estimated to be approximately 33 Mbp. By hybridizing genetically mapped RFLP and AFLP markers to CHEF blots, 25 of the 27 linkage groups were assigned to specific chromosomes. The barley-specific virulence locus VHv1 was localized on a chromosome of 2.80 Mbp from isolate ND9OPr in the CHEF gel. The total map length of the fungus was estimated to be at least 1,329 cM based on the map distance covered by the linked markers and the estimated gaps. Therefore, the physical to genetic distance ratio is approximately 25 kb/cM. Construction of a high-resolution map around target loci will facilitate the cloning of the genes conferring virulence and other characters in C. sativus by a map-based cloning strategy."

"12669804","abstracttext","The DNA sequence of an extracellular (EXC) domain of an oat (Avena sativa L.) receptor-like kinase (ALrk10) gene was amplified from 23 accessions of 15 Avena species (6 diploid, 6 tetraploid, and 3 hexaploid). Primers were designed from one partial oat ALrk10 clone that had been used to map the gene in hexaploid oat to linkage groups syntenic to Triticeae chromosome 1 and 3. Cluster (phylogenetic) analyses showed that all of the oat DNA sequences amplified with these primers are orthologous to the wheat and barley sequences that are located on chromosome 1 of the Triticeae species. Triticeae chromosome 3 Lrk10 sequences were not amplified using these primers. Cluster analyses provided evidence for multiple copies at a locus. The analysis divided the ALrk EXC sequences into two groups, one of which included AA and AABB genome species and the other CC, AACC, and CCCC genome species. Both groups of sequences were found in hexaploid AACCDD genome species, but not in all accessions. The C genome group was divided into 3 subgroups: (i) the CC diploids and the perennial autotetraploid, Avena macrostachya (this supports other evidence for the presence of the C in this autotetraploid species); (ii) a sequence from Avena maroccana and Avena murphyi and several sequences from different accessions of A. sativa; and (iii) A. murphyi and sequences from A. sativa and Avena sterilis. This suggests a possible polyphyletic origin for A. sativa from the AACC progenitor tetraploids or an origin from a progenitor of the AACC tetraploids. The sequences of the A genome group were not as clearly divided into subgroups. Although a group of sequences from the accession 'SunII' and a sequence from line Pg3, are clearly different from the others, the A genome diploid sequences were interspersed with tetraploid and hexaploid sequences."
"12691174","articletitle","Gene polymorphisms, inflammatory diseases and cancer."
"12691174","abstracttext","Genes whose products play a critical role in regulation of the immune response include the human leucocyte antigen (HLA) and cytokine families of genes. The HLA genes are the most polymorphic found in the human genome, and the bulk of this polymorphism results in functional differences in expressed HLA molecules, resulting in inter-individual differences in presentation of peptide antigens to T-cells. In addition, a considerable number of cytokine-associated gene polymorphisms have been identified, the bulk of which occur in the upstream promoter sequences of these genes, which in many cases results in differential in vitro expression of the respective pro- or anti-inflammatory gene product. Particular HLA polymorphisms result in well-defined associations with a large number of immunologically-mediated diseases, including some diseases with known dietary risk factors. For example, individuals of HLA-DQA1*0501, DQB1*0201 genotype have a greater than 200-fold increased risk of developing intolerance to dietary wheat gluten (coeliac disease), and additional HLA-related factors may influence the development of malignant lymphoma within pre-existing coeliac disease. Similarly, HLA-DRB1 alleles sharing a common sequence motif constitute the primary known genetic risk factor for rheumatoid arthritis. The influence of polymorphisms associated with differential cytokine expression on disease susceptibility is currently of much interest. Most attention has been focused on associations with susceptibility to benign immunologically-mediated diseases, including a number of gut diseases. However, recent work from our laboratory indicates that cytokine polymorphisms may influence susceptibility to and prognosis in a number of different cancers, including malignant melanoma skin cancer and solid tumours which may be influenced by diet, such as prostate cancer (collaboration with the CRC/BPG UK Familial Prostate Cancer study). In addition, preliminary work suggests that dietary modulation of expression levels of certain cytokines in healthy human subjects may be genotype dependent."

"15717193","abstracttext","Using barley and wheat expressed sequence tags as well as rice genomic sequence and mapping information, we revisited the genomic region encompassing the self-incompatibility (SI) locus Z on rye chromosome 2RL applying a comparative approach. We were able to arrange 12 novel sequence-tagged site (STS) markers around Z, spanning a genetic distance of 32.3 cM, with the closest flanking markers mapping at a distance of 0.5 cM and 1.0 cM from Z, respectively, and one marker cosegregating with Z, in a testcross population of 204 progeny. Two overlapping rice bacterial artifical chromosomes (BACs), OSJNBa0070O11 and OSJNBa0010D21, were found to carry rice orthologs of the three rye STS markers from the 1.5-cM interval encompassing Z. The STS-marker orthologs on these rice BACs span less than 125,000 bp of the rice genome. The STS marker TC116908 cosegregated with Z in a mapping population and revealed a high degree of polymorphism among a random sample of rye plants of various origin. TC116908 was shown via Southern hybridization to correspond to gene no. 10 (OSJNBa0070O11.10) on rice BAC OSJNBa0070O11. Reverse transcription-PCR with a TC116908-specific primer pair resulted in the amplification of a fragment of the expected size from the rye pistil but not from leaf cDNA. OSJNBa0070O11.10 was found to show a highly significant sequence similarity to AtUBP22, a ubiquitin-specific protease (UBP). TC116908 likely represents a putative UBP gene that is specifically expressed in rye pistils and cosegregates with Z. Given that the ubiquitination of proteins is emerging as a general mechanism involved in different SI systems of plants, TC116908 appears to be a promising target for further investigation with respect to its relation to the SI system of the grasses."

"15686526","abstracttext","The current focus of many functional genomic studies is on the elucidation of gene regulatory networks. The functional analyses of transcription factors and their DNA-binding sites, in conjunction with genome-wide expression profiling, are crucial in understanding of gene regulatory networks. This paper describes an efficient and easy method for characterizing the DNA-binding sequence specificity of novel plant transcription factors. This new method is based on the fusion of a DNA-binding protein (DBP) to 6xHis-tagged cellulase D (CELD), which serves both as a means for affinity purification of DBP-DNA complex in the selection of binding sites from a pool of biotinylated random-sequence oligonucleotides and as a reporter for measurement of DNA-binding activity. Thus, it eliminates the use of radioactivity and gel electrophoresis techniques currently used for purification of DBP-DNA complexes and assays of DNA-binding activity. The effectiveness of this method was demonstrated by the success of simultaneous selection of the binding sites of nine plant DBPs from four superfamilies (AP2, bHLH, NAC and MYB). The high-throughput capacity of CELD-based DNA-binding assays allows the quantitative analysis of the binding sequence specificity from a large number of DBP-selected oligonucleotides. The binding sequence specificity of three novel transcription factors (rice OsbHLH66, wheat TaNAC69 and TaMYB80), determined with this method, is presented. This new method provides the capacity of high-throughput analysis on the DNA-binding sequence specificity of a large number of putative transcription factors, predicted on the basis of conserved DNA-binding domains."

"15691958","abstracttext","The genotypic diversity of antibiotic-producing Pseudomonas spp. provides an enormous resource for identifying strains that are highly rhizosphere competent and superior for biological control of plant diseases. In this study, a simple and rapid method was developed to determine the presence and genotypic diversity of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG)-producing Pseudomonas strains in rhizosphere samples. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 350-bp fragments of phlD, a key gene involved in DAPG biosynthesis, allowed discrimination between genotypically different phlD(+) reference strains and indigenous isolates. DGGE analysis of the phlD fragments provided a level of discrimination between phlD(+) genotypes that was higher than the level obtained by currently used techniques and enabled detection of specific phlD(+) genotypes directly in rhizosphere samples with a detection limit of approximately 5 x 10(3) CFU/g of root. DGGE also allowed simultaneous detection of multiple phlD(+) genotypes present in mixtures in rhizosphere samples. DGGE analysis of 184 indigenous phlD(+) isolates obtained from the rhizospheres of wheat, sugar beet, and potato plants resulted in the identification of seven phlD(+) genotypes, five of which were not described previously based on sequence and phylogenetic analyses. Subsequent bioassays demonstrated that eight genotypically different phlD(+) genotypes differed substantially in the ability to colonize the rhizosphere of sugar beet seedlings. Collectively, these results demonstrated that DGGE analysis of the phlD gene allows identification of new genotypic groups of specific antibiotic-producing Pseudomonas with different abilities to colonize the rhizosphere of sugar beet seedlings."

"14667055","abstracttext","Molecular mechanisms that account for variation in base-line sensitivity to azole fungicides were examined in a collection of twenty field isolates, collected in France and Germany, of the wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel) Schroeter. The isolates tested represent the wide baseline sensitivity to the azole fungicide tebuconazole described previously. The isolates were cross-sensitive to other azoles tested, such as cyproconazole and ketoconazole, but not to unrelated chemicals like cycloheximide, kresoxim-methyl or rhodamine 6G. Progenies from a genetic cross between an isolate with an intermediate and a high sensitivity to azoles displayed a continuous range of phenotypes with respect to cyproconazole sensitivity, indicating that variation in azole sensitivity in this haploid organism is polygenic. The basal level of expression of the ATP-binding cassette transporter genes MgAtr1-MgAtr5 from Mgraminicola significantly varied amongst the isolates tested, but no clear increase in the transcript level of a particular MgAtr gene was found in the less sensitive isolates. Cyproconazole strongly induced expression of MgAtr4, but no correlation between expression levels of this gene and azole sensitivity was observed. One isolate with intermediate sensitivity to azoles over-expressed CYP51, encoding cytochrome P450 sterol 14alpha-demethylase from M graminicola. Isolates with a low or high sensitivity to azoles were tested for accumulation of cyproconazole, but no clear correlation between reduced accumulation of the fungicide in mycelium and sensitivity to azoles was observed. Therefore, differences in accumulation cannot account exclusively for the variation in base-line sensitivity of the isolates to azoles. The results indicate that multiple mechanisms account for differences in base-line sensitivity to azoles in field isolates of M graminicola."

"14760615","abstracttext","Structural studies of the high molecular mass (HMM) glutenin subunits 1Bx7 (from cvs Hereward and Galatea) and 1Bx20 (from cv. Bidi17) of bread wheat were conducted using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RP-HPLC/ESI-MS). For all three proteins, MALDI-TOFMS analysis showed that the isolated fractions contained a second component with a mass about 650 Da lower than the major component. The testing and correction of the gene-derived amino acid sequences of the three proteins were performed by direct MALDI-TOFMS analysis of their tryptic peptide mixture. Analysis of the digest was performed by recording several MALDI mass spectra of the mixture at low, medium and high mass ranges, optimizing the matrix and the acquisition parameters for each mass range. Complementary data were obtained by RP-HPLC/ESI-MS analysis of the tryptic digest. This resulted in coverage of about 98% of the sequences. In contrast to the gene-derived data, the results obtained demonstrate the insertion of the sequence QPGQGQ between Trp716 and Gln717 of subunit 1Bx7 (cv. Galatea) and a possible single amino acid substitution within the T20 peptide of subunit 1Bx20. Moreover, the mass spectrometric data demonstrated that the lower mass components present in all the fractions correspond to the major components but lack about six amino acid residues, which are probably lost from the protein C-terminus. Finally, the results obtained provide evidence for the lack of glycosylation or other post-translational modifications of these subunits."

"14985977","abstracttext","Gene tagging is the basis of marker-assisted selection and map-based cloning. To develop PCR-based markers for Pm4a, a dominant powdery mildew resistance gene of wheat, we surveyed 46 group 2 microsatellite markers between Pm4a near-isogenic line (NIL) CI 14124 and the recurrent parent Chancellor (Cc). One of the markers, gwm356, detected polymorphism and was used for genotyping an F(2) population of 85 plants derived from CI 14124 x Cc. Linkage mapping indicated that Xgwm356 was linked to Pm4a at a distance of 4.8 cM. To identify more PCR-based markers for Pm4a, we also converted the restriction fragment length polymorphism marker BCD1231 linked to it into a sequence-tagged site (STS) marker. The STS primer designed based on the end sequences of BCD1231 amplified an approximately 1.6-kb monomorphic band in both parents. Following digestion of the products with the four-cutter enzymes HaeIII and MspI, it was discovered that the band from CI 14124 consisted of at least two products, one of which had a digestion pattern different from the band from Cc. In the F(2) population, the cleaved polymorphism revealed by the STS marker between the parents co-segregated with powdery mildew resistance. To design Pm4a-specific PCR markers, the 1.6-kb band from Cc and the fragment associated with Pm4a in CI 14124 were sequenced and compared. Based on these sequences a new PCR marker was identified, which detected a 470-bp product only in the Pm4a-containing lines. These PCR-based markers provide a cost-saving option for marker-assisted selection of Pm4a."
"14986154","articletitle","Genetic basis of pre-harvest sprouting tolerance using single-locus and two-locus QTL analyses in bread wheat."
"14986154","abstracttext","Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis for pre-harvest sprouting tolerance (PHST) in bread wheat was conducted following single-locus and two-locus analyses, using data on a set of 110 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative population grown in four different environments. Single-locus analysis following composite interval mapping (CIM) resolved a total of five QTLs with one to four QTLs in each of the four individual environments. Four of these five QTLs were also detected following two-locus analysis, which resolved a total of 14 QTLs including 8 main effect QTLs (M-QTLs), 8 epistatic QTLs (E-QTLs) and 5 QTLs involved in QTL x environment (QE) or QTL x QTL x environment (QQE) interactions, some of these QTLs being common. The analysis revealed that a major fraction (76.68%) of the total phenotypic variation explained for PHST is due to M-QTLs (47.95%) and E-QTLs (28.73%), and that only a very small fraction of variation (3.24%) is due to QE and QQE interactions. Thus, more than three-quarters of the genetic variation for PHST is fixable and would contribute directly to gains under selection. Two QTLs that were detected in more than one environment and at LOD scores above the threshold values were located on 3BL and 3DL presumably in the vicinity of the dormancy gene TaVp1. Another QTL was found to be located on 3B, perhaps in close proximity to the R gene for red grain colour. However, these associations of QTLs for PHST with genes for dormancy and grain colour are only suggestive. The results obtained in the present study suggest that PHST is a complex trait controlled by large number of QTLs, some of them interacting among themselves or with the environment. These QTLs can be brought together through marker-aided selection, leading to enhanced PHST."

"15041046","abstracttext","In coeliac disease in the jejunum of a genetically susceptible person wheat gliadin and related prolamins from rye and barley trigger an immunological reaction, which induces small-bowel mucosal transformations, villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. Though CD4+ specific T cells, intraepithelial lymphocytes, infiltrating plasma cells and autoantibodies are known to have an effect on the coeliac disease, the pathogenic mechanisms leading to the tissue injury remain to be elucidated. Our aim was to find novel gene transcripts, which might have a role in coeliac disease pathogenesis. The gene expression in duodenal biopsy samples from untreated coeliac patients (n=4), patients on gluten-free diet (n=4) and healthy controls (n=4) was studied by cDNA microarray analysis. The method allows monitoring of the expression of thousands of genes simultaneously. Compared to healthy controls, the expression of 156 and 60 genes was changed in untreated and treated coeliac disease, respectively. Between treated and untreated coeliac disease, 98 genes had altered expression. Of the 5184 genes or expressed sequence tags, altogether 263 were affected. Many of these genes are directly or indirectly connected to T-cell activation, B-cell maturation or epithelial cell differentiation. By the microarray method, numerous genes were found to evince altered mRNA expression in coeliac disease. The method holds promise in exploring the pathogenetic mechanisms in the small bowel and may reveal new target genes for the therapy of coeliac disease."
"15003540","articletitle","A novel apoptotic pathway as defined by lectin cellular initiation."
"15003540","abstracttext","In this study of lectin-induced apoptosis we found that wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) initiated an accelerated type of programmed cell death developing after only 30 min of incubation with tumor cells. To analyze possible mechanisms, studies were focused using the WGA lectin whose carbohydrate specificity is well defined. We found that WGA could induce apoptosis by binding to either N-acetylneuraminic acid or N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) on the cell surface of normal and malignant cells. We also showed that it is unlikely that WGA triggers apoptosis by binding to the carbohydrate portion of Fas. CrmA gene transfection did not inhibit WGA-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells. In addition, Jurkat-R cells selected for resistance to Fas signaled apoptosis manifested high sensitivity to WGA as did Fas-negative BL6 melanoma cells. WGA-induced apoptosis is also caspase-3-independent and was found to be triggered via a mitochondrial pathway. WGA induced a loss of transmembrane potential, disruption of the inner mitochondria membrane, and release of cytochrome c and caspase-9 activation after 30 min of cell interaction. Interestingly, Bcl-2 gene transfection did not affect sensitivity of Jurkat cells to WGA. The Jurkat-R subline that has been shown to be Bax and Bak deficient and resistant to various apoptotic signals was highly sensitive to WGA-induced apoptosis. In summary, WGA triggers a unique pattern of apoptosis that is extremely fast, Fas- and caspase-3-independent, and is mediated via a mitochondrial pathway. However, its mitochondrial component is unrestrained by the loss of Bax and Bak or the upregulation of Bcl-2 expression."

"15240251","abstracttext","Using 16S rRNA gene-based approaches, we analyzed the responses of ileal and colonic bacterial communities of weaning piglets to dietary addition of four fermentable carbohydrates (inulin, lactulose, wheat starch, and sugar beet pulp). An enriched diet and a control diet lacking these fermentable carbohydrates were fed to piglets for 4 days (n = 48), and 10 days (n = 48), and the lumen-associated microbiota were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of amplified 16S rRNA genes. Bacterial diversities in the ileal and colonic samples were measured by assessing the number of DGGE bands and the Shannon index of diversity. A higher number of DGGE bands in the colon (24.2 +/- 5.5) than in the ileum (9.7 +/- 4.2) was observed in all samples. In addition, significantly higher diversity, as measured by DGGE fingerprint analysis, was detected in the colonic microbial community of weaning piglets fed the fermentable-carbohydrate-enriched diet for 10 days than in the control. Selected samples from the ileal and colonic lumens were also investigated using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and cloning and sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. This revealed a prevalence of Lactobacillus reuteri in the ileum and Lactobacillus amylovorus-like populations in the ileum and the colon in the piglets fed with fermentable carbohydrates. Newly developed oligonucleotide probes targeting these phylotypes allowed their rapid detection and quantification in the ileum and colon by FISH. The results indicate that addition of fermentable carbohydrates supports the growth of specific lactobacilli in the ilea and colons of weaning piglets."
"16339936","articletitle","A secreted lipase encoded by LIP1 is necessary for efficient use of saturated triglyceride lipids in Fusarium graminearum."
"16339936","abstracttext","A triglyceride lipase gene LIP1 was identified in the genome of Fusarium graminearum strain PH-1. The predicted protein encoded by LIP1 contains 591 amino acid residues with a putative N-terminal signal peptide and shows 57 and 40-44 % identity to a Botrytis cinerea lipase and five Candida rugosa lipases, respectively. Yeast cells overexpressing LIP1 showed lipolytic activity against a broad range of triglyceride substrates. Northern blot analyses revealed that expression of LIP1 was activated in planta during the fungal infection process. LIP1 expression was strongly induced in minimal medium supplemented with wheatgerm oil, but only weakly induced by olive oil and triolein. In contrast, supplementation with other carbon sources, including glucose, sucrose, apple pectin and wheat cell-wall material, did not induce LIP1 expression. Saturated fatty acids were the strongest inducers for LIP1 expression and this induction was suppressed proportionally by the presence of the unsaturated fatty acid. To determine the potential function of LIP1, gene replacement was conducted on strain PH-1. When compared with wild-type PH-1, DeltaLIP1 mutants showed greatly reduced lipolytic activities at the early stage of incubation on minimal medium supplemented with either saturated or unsaturated lipid as the substrate, indicating that LIP1 encodes a secreted lipase for exogenous lipid hydrolysis. Moreover, the DeltaLIP1 mutants exhibited growth deficiency on both liquid and solid minimal media supplemented with the saturated triglyceride tristearin as the sole carbon source, suggesting that LIP1 is required for utilization of this substance. Despite these differences, no variation in disease symptoms between the DeltaLIP1 mutants and the wild-type strain was observed on susceptible cereal hosts."

"16454653","abstracttext","Until recently, adenovirus-based gene therapy has been almost exclusively based on human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5). The aim of this study was to systematically compare the efficiency of transduction of primary muscle cells from various species by two adenoviral vectors from subgroups C and D. Transduction of a panel of myoblasts demonstrated a striking specificity of an Ad19a-based replication-defective E1-deleted vector (Ad19aEGFP) for human cells, whereas the Ad5-based vector had high affinity for nonhuman primate myoblasts. Transgene expression correlated well with cell-associated vector genomes. Up to 6.59% of the initially applied Ad19aEGFP vector particles were taken up by human myoblasts, as compared with 0.1% of the corresponding Ad5 vector. Remarkably, Ad19aEGFP but not Ad5EGFP efficiently transduced differentiated human myotubes, an in vitro model for skeletal muscle transduction. Uptake of Ad19aEGFP vector particles in human myotubes was 12-fold more efficient than that of Ad5EGFP. Moreover, both vectors demonstrated an early block at the level of vector uptake in mouse myoblasts and rat L6 cells. Investigation of the underlying mechanism for binding and uptake of the two vectors by human myoblasts showed high susceptibility for Ad19a to neuraminidase and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) lectin, whereas Ad5-mediated transduction was dependent on binding to the coxsackie-adenovirus receptor (CAR) and sensitive to soluble RGD peptide and heparin. Our study offers insights into species-dependent factors that determine Ad tropism and, moreover, provides a basis for application of the novel Ad19a-based vector for gene transfer into human skeletal muscle."

"16859492","abstracttext","The physiological role of the mannitol cycle in the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum (glume blotch) has been investigated by reverse genetics and metabolite profiling. A putative mannitol 2-dehydrogenase gene (Mdh1) was cloned by degenerate PCR and disrupted. The resulting mutated mdh1 strains lacked all detectable NADPH-dependent mannitol dehydrogenase activity. The mdh1 strains were unaffected for mannitol production but, surprisingly, were still able to utilize mannitol as a sole carbon source, suggesting a hitherto unknown mechanism for mannitol catabolism. The mutant strains were not compromised in their ability to cause disease or sporulate. To further our understanding of mannitol metabolism, a previously developed mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (gene mpd1) disruption construct [Solomon, Tan and Oliver (2005) Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 18, 110-115] was introduced into the mutated mdh1 background, resulting in a strain lacking both enzyme activities. The mpd1mdh1 strains were unable to grow on mannitol and produced only trace levels of mannitol. The double-mutant strains were unable to sporulate in vitro when grown on minimal medium for extended periods. Deficiency in sporulation was correlated with the depletion of intracellular mannitol pools. Significantly sporulation could be restored with the addition of mannitol. Pathogenicity of the double mutant was not compromised, although, like the previously characterized mpd1 mutants, the strains were unable to sporulate in planta. These findings not only question the currently hypothesized pathways of mannitol metabolism, but also identify for the first time that mannitol is required for sporulation of a filamentous fungus."
"19238623","articletitle","Mechanisms of deoxynivalenol-induced gene expression and apoptosis."
"19238623","abstracttext","Fusarium infection of agricultural staples such as wheat, barley and corn with concurrent production of deoxynivalenol (DON) and other trichothecene mycotoxins is an increasingly common problem worldwide. In addition to its emetic effects, chronic dietary exposure to DON causes impaired weight gain, anorexia, decreased nutritional efficiency and immune dysregulation in experimental animals. Trichothecenes are both immunostimulatory or immunosuppressive depending on dose, frequency and duration of exposure as well as type of immune function assay. Monocytes, macrophages, as well as T- and B-lymphocytes of the immune system can be cellular targets of DON and other trichothecenes. In vitro exposure to low trichothecene concentrations upregulates expression both transcriptionally and post-transcriptionally of cytokines, chemokines and inflammatory genes with concurrent immune stimulation, whereas exposure to high concentrations promotes leukocyte apoptosis with concomitant immune suppression. DON and other trichothecenes, via a mechanism known as the 'ribotoxic stress response', bind to ribosomes and rapidly activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The latter are important transducers of downstream signalling events related to immune response and apoptosis. Using cloned macrophages, two critical upstream transducers of DON-induced MAPK activation have been identified. One transducer is double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-activated protein kinase (PKR), a widely expressed serine/threonine protein kinase that can be activated by dsRNA, interferon and other agents. The other transducer is haematopoetic cell kinase (Hck), a non-receptor associated Src oncogene family kinase. Pharmacological inhibitors and gene suppression studies have revealed that Hck and PKR contribute to DON-induced gene expression and apoptosis. PKR, Hck and other kinases bind to the ribosome and are activated following DON interaction. Future studies will focus on the sequence of molecular events at the ribosome level that drive selective activation of these upstream kinases."

"18943679","abstracttext","ABSTRACT The tritimovirus Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) and the machlomovirus Maize chlorotic mottle virus (MCMV) each cause systemic chlorosis in infected maize plants. Infection of maize with both viruses produces corn lethal necrosis disease (CLND). Here, we report that complete deletion of the WSMV helper component-proteinase (HC-Pro) coding region had no effect on induction of CLND symptoms following coinoculation of maize with WSMV and MCMV. We further demonstrated that elevation of virus titers in double infections, relative to single infections, also was independent of WSMV HC-Pro. Thus, unlike potyvirus HC-Pro, WSMV HC-Pro was dispensable for disease synergism. Because disease synergism involving potyviruses requires HC-Pro-mediated suppression of posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS), we hypothesized that WSMV HC-Pro may not be a suppressor of PTGS. Indeed, WSMV HC-Pro did not suppress PTGS of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgene in an Agrobacterium-mediated coinfiltration assay in which potyvirus HC-Pro acted as a strong suppressor. Furthermore, coinfiltration with potyvirus HC-Pro, but not WSMV HC-Pro, resulted in elevated levels of the GFP target mRNA under conditions which trigger PTGS. Collectively, these results revealed significant differences in HC-Pro function among divergent genera of the family Potyviridae and suggest that the tritimovirus WSMV utilizes a gene other than HC-Pro to suppress PTGS and mediate synergistic interactions with unrelated viruses."

"18943753","abstracttext","ABSTRACT In order to confirm and refine the current classification scheme of Xanthomonas translucens and to identify novel strains from ornamental asparagus, a collection of field and reference strains was analyzed. Rep-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) genomic fingerprint profiles were generated from 33 isolates pathogenic to asparagus as well as 61 X. trans-lucens reference strains pathogenic to cereals and grasses. Amplified ribo-somal gene restriction analysis profiles were obtained from most of these and 29 additional Xanthomonas reference strains. Rep-PCR genomic fingerprint profiles of all strains were compared with those in a large Xanthomonas database using computer-assisted analysis. Rep-PCR ge-nomic fingerprinting facilitated the characterization and discrimination of X. translucens, including the pathovars arrhenatheri, graminis, phlei, phleipratensis, and poae, as well as a number of strains received as X. translucens pv. cerealis. Strains received as pathovars hordei, secalis, translucens, undulosa, and other cerealis strains were grouped in two subclusters that correspond to the recently redefined pathovars X. trans-lucens pvs. undulosa and translucens. All 33 novel isolates from ornamental asparagus (tree fern; Asparagus virgatus) were identified as X. translucens pv. undulosa. Moreover, a unique amplified small subunit ribosomal gene MspI/AluI restriction profile specific for all X. translucens strains tested, including those pathogenic to asparagus, allowed discrimination from all other Xanthomonas spp. Although phage tests were inconclusive, the classification of the asparagus strains within the X. translucens complex was supported by pathogenicity assays in which all the isolates from ornamental asparagus induced watersoaking on wheat. Surprisingly, several X. translucens reference strains affected asparagus tree fern as well. That the novel asparagus isolates belong to X. translucens pv. undulosa is extraordinary because all hosts of X. translucens pathovars described to date belong only to the families Gramineae and Poaceae, whereas asparagus belongs to the phylogenetically distant family Liliaceae."
"19411619","articletitle","G(alpha) and Gbeta proteins regulate the cyclic AMP pathway that is required for development and pathogenicity of the phytopathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola."
"19411619","abstracttext","We identified and functionally characterized genes encoding three Galpha proteins and one Gbeta protein in the dimorphic fungal wheat pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola, which we designated MgGpa1, MgGpa2, MgGpa3, and MgGpb1, respectively. Sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analyses showed that MgGPA1 and MgGPA3 are most related to the mammalian Galpha(i) and Galpha(s) families, respectively, whereas MgGPA2 is not related to either of these families. On potato dextrose agar (PDA) and in yeast glucose broth (YGB), MgGpa1 mutants produced significantly longer spores than those of the wild type (WT), and these developed into unique fluffy mycelia in the latter medium, indicating that this gene negatively controls filamentation. MgGpa3 mutants showed more pronounced yeast-like growth accompanied with hampered filamentation and secreted a dark-brown pigment into YGB. Germ tubes emerging from spores of MgGpb1 mutants were wavy on water agar and showed a nested type of growth on PDA that was due to hampered filamentation, numerous cell fusions, and increased anastomosis. Intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels of MgGpb1 and MgGpa3 mutants were decreased, indicating that both genes positively regulate the cAMP pathway, which was confirmed because the WT phenotype was restored by adding cAMP to these mutant cultures. The cAMP levels in MgGpa1 mutants and the WT were not significantly different, suggesting that this gene might be dispensable for cAMP regulation. In planta assays showed that mutants of MgGpa1, MgGpa3, and MgGpb1 are strongly reduced in pathogenicity. We concluded that the heterotrimeric G proteins encoded by MgGpa3 and MgGpb1 regulate the cAMP pathway that is required for development and pathogenicity in M. graminicola."

"17570855","abstracttext_background","Stowaway elements are short, non-autonomous DNA transposons categorized as miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs). The high MITE copy number in grass genomes suggests an active history of amplification and insertion, but ongoing MITE activity has only rarely been seen, and ongoing Stowaway activity has never been observed. Thus, a phylogenetic perspective on presence vs. absence of elements in an aligned data set can provide valuable historical insights into the dynamics of MITE acquisition and loss."
"17570855","abstracttext_results","A Stowaway-like element resides within the fourth intron of a beta-amylase gene in representatives of five genera in the wheat tribe, Triticeae. Its presence vs. absence was examined with reference to the beta-amylase gene tree topology, and in light of sequence comparisons of the beta-amylase elements to Triticeae Stowaway elements in the Entrez nucleotide database. Among the sequences lacking the element, there are five distinct putative excision footprints (one widespread and four restricted to unrelated lineages) and two flanking deletions. The sequences that do contain elements are polyphyletic on the beta-amylase tree, and their elements are divergent at the sequence level. The beta-amylase elements do not form a monophyletic group relative to other Stowaway elements in Entrez; most are more similar to elements from other loci in other Triticeae genomes than they are to one another."
"17570855","abstracttext_conclusion","Combined, the phylogenetic distribution, sequence variation, and Entrez database comparisons indicate that a Stowaway-like element has undergone multiple deletions from and insertions into the same site in beta-amylase intron 4 during the history of the tribe. The elements currently at the site represent multiple, distinct lineages that transcend generic boundaries. While patterns of Stowaway polymorphism across a phylogenetic data set do not allow evolutionary mechanisms to be inferred with certainty, they do provide insights into the dynamics of element evolution over an extended time scale. The historical perspective provided by a phylogenetic approach is complementary to the few studies in which ongoing MITE activity has been documented."

"16957123","abstracttext","The taxonomic position of two lactic-acid-producing bacterial strains, isolated from wheat sourdough in South Korea, was studied using a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and biochemical and physiological characteristics indicated these two strains to be members of the genus Lactobacillus. They had high 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity (98.5 %) with Lactobacillus rossiae DSM 15814(T) and very low (<94.0 %) similarity with any other recognized species of the genus Lactobacillus. These two strains (designated M1-212(T) and M2-236) were heterofermentative, facultatively anaerobic, Gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-motile, short rod-shaped bacteria. The optimum growth temperature for these strains was 30 degrees C (no growth at 15 or 45 degrees C) and they were able to tolerate 5 % (w/v) NaCl. The G+C content of the genomic DNA of the two strains was 45.5 mol%, within the range of values reported for the genus Lactobacillus (32-53 mol%). The peptidoglycan was of the A3alpha (l-lys-d-glu-l-Ala) type. Physiological, biochemical and genotypic data, as well as results of DNA-DNA hybridization of the genomic DNA with one of the closest phylogenetic relatives, L. rossiae DSM 15814(T), indicated that the strains represent a novel species of the genus Lactobacillus, for which the name Lactobacillus siliginis sp. nov. is proposed.

"17496130","abstracttext","The effect of the glutathione reductase (GshR) activity of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM20451(T) on the thiol levels in fermented sourdoughs was determined, and the oxygen tolerance of the strain was also determined. The gshR gene coding for a putative GshR was sequenced and inactivated by single-crossover integration to yield strain L. sanfranciscensis DSM20451(T)DeltagshR. The gene disruption was verified by sequencing the truncated gshR and surrounding regions on the chromosome. The gshR activity of L. sanfranciscensis DSM20451(T)DeltagshR was strongly reduced compared to that of the wild-type strain, demonstrating that gshR indeed encodes an active GshR enzyme. The thiol levels in wheat doughs fermented with L. sanfranciscensis DSM20451 increased from 9 microM to 10.5 microM sulfhydryl/g of dough during a 24-h sourdough fermentation, but in sourdoughs fermented with L. sanfranciscensis DSM20451(T)DeltagshR and in chemically acidified doughs, the thiol levels decreased to 6.5 to 6.8 microM sulfhydryl/g of dough. Remarkably, the GshR-negative strains Lactobacillus pontis LTH2587 and Lactobacillus reuteri BR11 exerted effects on thiol levels in dough comparable to those of L. sanfranciscensis. In addition to the effect on thiol levels in sourdough, the loss of GshR activity in L. sanfranciscensis DSM20451(T)DeltagshR resulted in a loss of oxygen tolerance. The gshR mutant strain exhibited a strongly decreased aerobic growth rate on modified MRS medium compared to either the growth rate under anaerobic conditions or that of the wild-type strain, and aerobic growth was restored by the addition of cysteine. Moreover, the gshR mutant strain was more sensitive to the superoxide-generating agent paraquat."
"16740662","articletitle","AtALMT1, which encodes a malate transporter, is identified as one of several genes critical for aluminum tolerance in Arabidopsis."
"16740662","abstracttext","Aluminum (Al) tolerance in Arabidopsis is a genetically complex trait, yet it is mediated by a single physiological mechanism based on Al-activated root malate efflux. We investigated a possible molecular determinant for Al tolerance involving a homolog of the wheat Al-activated malate transporter, ALMT1. This gene, named AtALMT1 (At1g08430), was the best candidate from the 14-member AtALMT family to be involved with Al tolerance based on expression patterns and genomic location. Physiological analysis of a transferred DNA knockout mutant for AtALMT1 as well as electrophysiological examination of the protein expressed in Xenopus oocytes showed that AtALMT1 is critical for Arabidopsis Al tolerance and encodes the Al-activated root malate efflux transporter associated with tolerance. However, gene expression and sequence analysis of AtALMT1 alleles from tolerant Columbia (Col), sensitive Landsberg erecta (Ler), and other ecotypes that varied in Al tolerance suggested that variation observed at AtALMT1 is not correlated with the differences observed in Al tolerance among these ecotypes. Genetic complementation experiments indicated that the Ler allele of AtALMT1 is equally effective as the Col allele in conferring Al tolerance and Al-activated malate release. Finally, fine-scale mapping of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for Al tolerance on chromosome 1 indicated that AtALMT1 is located proximal to this QTL. These results indicate that AtALMT1 is an essential factor for Al tolerance in Arabidopsis but does not represent the major Al tolerance QTL also found on chromosome 1."

"17202864","abstracttext","Sialic acid is a sugar typically found at the N-glycan termini of glycoproteins in mammalian cells. Lec3 CHO cell mutants are deficient in epimerase activity, due to a defect in the gene that encodes a bifunctional UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc kinase (GNE). Sialic acid modification on the cell surface is partially affected in these cells. We have mutagenized Lec3 CHO cells and isolated six mutants (termed C2m) deficient in the cell surface expression of polysialic acid (PSA). Mutant C2m9 was partially defective in expression of cell-surface PSA and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) binding, while in the other five mutants, both cell-surface PSA and WGA binding were undetectable. PSA expression was restored by complementation with the gene encoding the CMP-sialic acid transporter (CST), indicating that CST mutations were responsible for the phenotypes of the C2m cells. We characterized the CST mutations in these cells by Northern blotting and RT-PCR. C2m9 and C2m45 carried missense mutations resulting in glycine to glutamate substitutions at amino acids 217 (G217E) and 256 (G256E), respectively. C2m13, C2m39 and C2m31 had nonsense mutations that resulted in decreased CST mRNA stability, and C2m34 carried a putative splice site mutation. PSA and CD15s expression in CST-deficient Lec2 cells were partially rescued by G217E CST, but not by G256E CST, although both proteins were expressed at similar levels, and localized to the Golgi. These results indicate that the novel missense mutations isolated in this study affect CST activity."

"18757939","abstracttext","Four LMW-m and one novel chimeric (between LMW-i and LMW-m types) low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) genes from Aegilops neglecta (UUMM), Ae. kotschyi (UUSS), and Ae. juvenalis (DDMMUU) were isolated and characterized. Sequence structures showed that the 4 LMW-m-type genes, assigned to the M genome of Ae. neglecta, displayed a high homology with those from hexaploid common wheat. The novel chimeric gene, designed as AjkLMW-i, was isolated from both Ae. kotschyi and Ae. juvenalis and shown to be located on the U genome. Phylogentic analysis demonstrated that it had higher identity to the LMW-m-type than the LMW-i-type genes. A total of 20 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were detected among the 4 LMW-m genes, with 13 of these being nonsynonymous SNPs that resulted in amino acid substitutions in the deduced mature proteins. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that it had higher identity to the LMW-m-type than the LMW-i-type genes. The divergence time estimation showed that the M and D genomes were closely related and diverged at 5.42 million years ago (MYA) while the differentiation between the U and A genomes was 6.82 MYA. We propose that, in addition to homologous recombination, an illegitimate recombination event on the U genome may have occurred 6.38 MYA and resulted in the generation of the chimeric gene AjkLMW-i, which may be an important genetic mechanism for the origin and evolution of LMW-GS Glu-3 alleles as well as other prolamin genes."

"20080826","abstracttext","Grain weight is one of the most important components of cereal yield and quality. A clearer understanding of the physiological and molecular determinants of this complex trait would provide an insight into the potential benefits for plant breeding. In the present study, the dynamics of dry matter accumulation, water uptake, and grain size in parallel with the expression of expansins during grain growth in wheat were analysed. The stabilized water content of grains showed a strong association with final grain weight (r(2)=0.88, P <0.01). Grain length was found to be the trait that best correlated with final grain weight (r(2)=0.98, P <0.01) and volume (r(2)=0.94, P <0.01). The main events that defined final grain weight occurred during the first third of grain-filling when maternal tissues (the pericarp of grains) undergo considerable expansion. Eight expansin coding sequences were isolated from pericarp RNA and the temporal profiles of accumulation of these transcripts were monitored. Sequences showing high homology with TaExpA6 were notably abundant during early grain expansion and declined as maturity was reached. RNA in situ hybridization studies revealed that the transcript for TaExpA6 was principally found in the pericarp during early growth in grain development and, subsequently, in both the endosperm and pericarp. The signal in these images is likely to be the sum of the transcript levels of all three sequences with high similarity to the TaExpA6 gene. The early part of the expression profile of this putative expansin gene correlates well with the critical periods of early grain expansion, suggesting it as a possible factor in the final determination of grain size."
"20229345","articletitle","Effects of water stress on development, operation and gene expression of cyanide-resistant respiratory pathway in wheat."
"20229345","abstracttext","Osmotic dehydration of wheat seedlings in -0.5 MPa polyethylene glycol (PEG) solutions for 24, 48 and 72 h resulted in mild, moderate and severe water stress respectively in leaves, but only caused mild water stress in roots as reflected by the changes in relative water content (RWC). In response to the above water stress conditions, leaf total respiratory rate (V(t)) decreased progressively, and the alternative pathway (AP) capacity (V(alt)) and its actual operation activity (rhoV(alt)) decreased more severely. Water stress also led to continuous reduction in cytochrome pathway (CP) activity ((rho' V (cyt)) and different changes in the contribution of rhoV(alt) and rho'V(cyt) to V(t), in leaves, with rhoV(alt)/ V(t), decreasing and rho'V(cyt)/V(t) increasing. The change pattern of root V(t) was similar to that of its RWC, while root V(alt) and rhoV(alt) were found to decrease during the first 24 h of stress and thereafter recover to a level close to that of the control (0 h). These data indicate that the alternative pathway is sensitive to water stress and can adapt mild water stress. The results of northern hybridization using an alternative oxidase gene (Aox) as probe revealed that there was a good correlation between V(alt) (also rhoV(alt)) and Aox mRNA levels in both leaves and roots, suggesting that water stress affects the development and operation of AP respiration through affecting the expression of the alternative oxidase gene."
"20213518","articletitle","CBF gene copy number variation at Frost Resistance-2 is associated with levels of freezing tolerance in temperate-climate cereals."
"20213518","abstracttext","Frost Resistance-1 (FR-1) and FR-2 are two loci affecting freezing tolerance and winter hardiness of the temperate-climate cereals. FR-1 is hypothesized to be due to the pleiotropic effects of VRN-1. FR-2 spans a cluster of C-Repeat Binding Factor (CBF) genes. These loci are genetically and functionally linked. Recent studies indicate CBF transcripts are downregulated by the VRN-1 encoded MADS-box protein or a factor in the VRN-1 pathway. Here, we report that barley genotypes 'Dicktoo' and 'Nure' carrying a vrn-H1 winter allele at VRN-H1 harbor increased copy numbers of CBF coding sequences relative to Vrn-H1 spring allele genotypes 'Morex' and 'Tremois'. Sequencing bacteriophage lambda genomic clones from these four genotypes alongside DNA blot hybridizations indicate approximately half of the eleven CBF orthologs at FR-H2 are duplicated in individual genomes. One of these duplications discriminates vrn-H1 genotypes from Vrn-H1 genotypes. The vrn-H1 winter allele genotypes harbor tandem segmental duplications through the CBF2A-CBF4B genomic region and maintain two distinct CBF2 paralogs, while the Vrn-H1 spring allele genotypes harbor single copies of CBF2 and CBF4. An additional CBF gene, CBF13, is a pseudogene interrupted by multiple non-sense codons in 'Tremois' whereas CBF13 is a complete uninterrupted coding sequence in 'Dicktoo' and 'Nure'. DNA blot hybridization with wheat DNAs reveals greater copy numbers of CBF14 also occurs in winter wheats than in spring wheats. These data indicate that variation in CBF gene copy numbers is widespread in the Triticeae and suggest selection for winter hardiness co-selects winter alleles at both VRN-1 and FR-2."
"20132516","articletitle","Modelling pollen-mediated gene flow in rice: risk assessment and management of transgene escape."
"20132516","abstracttext","Fast development and commercialization of genetically modified plants have aroused concerns of transgene escape and its environmental consequences. A model that can effectively predict pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) is essential for assessing and managing risks from transgene escape. A pollen-trap method was used to measure the wind-borne pollen dispersal in cultivated rice and common wild rice, and effects of relative humidity, temperature and wind speed on pollen dispersal were estimated. A PMGF model was constructed based on the pollen dispersal pattern in rice, taking outcrossing rates of recipients and cross-compatibility between rice and its wild relatives into consideration. Published rice gene flow data were used to validate the model. Pollen density decreased in a simple exponential pattern with distances to the rice field. High relative humidity reduced pollen dispersal distances. Model simulation showed an increased PMGF frequency with the increase of pollen source size (the area of a rice field), but this effect levelled off with a large pollen-source size. Cross-compatibility is essential when modelling PMGF from rice to its wild relatives. The model fits the data well, including PMGF from rice to its wild relatives. Therefore, it can be used to predict PMGF in rice under diverse conditions (e.g. different outcrossing rates and cross-compatibilities), facilitating the determination of isolation distances to minimize transgene escape. The PMGF model may be extended to other wind-pollinated plant species such as wheat and barley."

"20135200","abstracttext","Glutathione acts as a protein disulphide reductant, which detoxifies herbicides by conjugation, either spontaneously or by the activity of one of a number of glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), and regulates gene expression in response to environmental stress and pathogen attack. GSTs play roles in both normal cellular metabolisms as well as in the detoxification of a wide variety of xenobiotic compounds, and they have been intensively studied with regard to herbicide detoxification in plants. A newly discovered plant GST subclass has been implicated in numerous stress responses, including those arising from pathogen attack, oxidative stress and heavy-metal toxicity. In addition, plants GSTs play a role in the cellular response to auxins and during the normal metabolism of plant secondary products like anthocyanins and cinnamic acid. The present work involves two in silico analytical approaches-general secondary structure prediction studies of the proteins and detailed signature pattern studies of some selected GST classes in Arabdiopsis thaliana, mustard, maize and bread wheat by standard Bioinformatics tools; structure prediction tools; signature pattern tools; and the evolutionary trends were analyzed by ClustalW. For this purpose, sequences were obtained from standard databases. The work reveals that these proteins are mainly alpha helical in nature with specific signature pattern similar to phosphokinase C, tyrosine kinase and casein kinase II proteins, which are closely related to plant oxidative stress. This study aims to comprehend the relationship of GST gene family and plant oxidative stress with respect to certain specific conserved motifs, which may help in future studies for screening of biomodulators involved in plant stress metabolism."
"20507445","articletitle","Selection for increased cyproconazole tolerance in Mycosphaerella graminicola through local adaptation and in response to host resistance."
"20507445","abstracttext","SUMMARY Sterol demethylation inhibitors (DMIs) represent one of the largest groups of systemic fungicides that have been used to control agriculturally important fungal pathogens. Knowledge regarding the evolution of fungicide resistance in agricultural ecosystems is fragmentary and a better understanding of the processes driving the development of DMI resistance in populations of fungal pathogens is needed by plant pathologists and the agrochemical industry. We considered some of these processes using approaches based on molecular population and quantitative genetics. Five Mycosphaerella graminicola populations sampled from unsprayed wheat fields on four continents were assayed for eight restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers and their level of tolerance to cyproconazole. DMI fungicides such as cyproconazole inhibit the enzyme eburicol 14-alpha-demethylase. The gene encoding this target, CYP51, was sequenced for all isolates. We found unimodal, continuous variations in cyproconazole tolerance among the M. graminicola isolates sampled from individual fields, consistent with a polygenic mode of inheritance. We also found that population differentiation for cyproconazole tolerance (Q(ST)) among the five M. graminicola populations was significantly higher than the corresponding population differentiation for neutral RFLP markers (G(ST)), suggesting that selection for cyproconazole tolerance in the Swiss population has already led to local adaptation that can be seen even in an unsprayed population. The Swiss population displayed the highest level of tolerance to cyproconazole, in addition to a lower than expected quantitative variation in fungicide tolerance and a skewed distribution, indicating that selection had increased the overall tolerance of this population. Further analysis with DNA sequencing showed that the population from Switzerland was dominated by isolates with several point mutations and a 6-bp deletion in CYP51. This deletion and one of the point mutations were previously related to increased resistance in field isolates. The fungal population from Oregon sampled from an unsprayed resistant host cultivar displayed the same gene diversity in RFLP loci but higher cyproconazole tolerance and quantitative variation in tolerance than the fungal population from the same field sampled from an unsprayed susceptible host cultivar."
"20507510","articletitle","The siderophore biosynthetic gene SID1, but not the ferroxidase gene FET3, is required for full Fusarium graminearum virulence."
"20507510","abstracttext_summary","To acquire iron from plant hosts, fungal pathogens have evolved at least two pathways for iron uptake. One system is hinged on the secretion and subsequent uptake of low-molecular-weight iron chelators termed siderophores, while the other uses cell-surface reductases to solubilize ferric iron by reducing it to ferrous iron for uptake. We identified five iron uptake-related genes from the head blight pathogen Fusarium graminearum and showed that they were transcribed in response to iron limitation. To examine the relative contribution of the reductive and siderophore pathways of iron uptake, we created mutants disrupted at the ferroxidase gene FET3 (Deltafet3) or the siderophore biosynthetic gene SID1 (Deltasid1). The Deltafet3 mutants produced wild-type amounts of siderophores and grew at the same rate as the wild-type under iron limitation, but accumulated high levels of free intracellular iron. The Deltasid1 mutants did not produce siderophores and grew slowly under low iron conditions. Transcription of the iron uptake-related genes was induced in the Deltasid1 mutant regardless of the growth medium iron content, whereas these genes were transcribed normally in the Deltafet3 mutant. Finally, the Deltasid1 mutants could infect single, inoculated spikelets, but were unable to spread from spikelet-to-spikelet through the rachises of wheat spikes, while the Deltafet3 mutants behaved as wild-type throughout infection. Together, our data suggest that siderophore-mediated iron uptake is the major pathway of cellular iron uptake and is required for full virulence in F. graminearum."

"20521957","abstracttext","Some root-associated pseudomonads sustain plant growth by suppressing root diseases caused by pathogenic fungi. We investigated to which extent select cereal cultivars influence expression of relevant biocontrol traits (i.e., root colonization efficacy and antifungal activity) in Pseudomonas fluorescens CHA0. In this representative plant-beneficial bacterium, the antifungal metabolites 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), pyrrolnitrin (PRN), pyoluteorin (PLT), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) are required for biocontrol. To monitor host plant effects on the expression of biosynthetic genes for these compounds on roots, we developed fluorescent dual-color reporters suited for flow cytometric analysis using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In the dual-label strains, the constitutively expressed red fluorescent protein mCherry served as a cell tag and marker for root colonization, whereas reporter fusions based on the green fluorescent protein allowed simultaneous recording of antifungal gene expression within the same cell. FACS analysis revealed that expression of DAPG and PRN biosynthetic genes was promoted in a cereal rhizosphere, whereas expression of PLT and HCN biosynthetic genes was markedly less sustained. When analyzing the response of the bacterial reporters on roots of a selection of wheat, spelt, and triticale cultivars, we were able to detect subtle species- and cultivar-dependent differences in colonization and DAPG and HCN gene expression levels. The expression of these biocontrol traits was particularly favored on roots of one spelt cultivar, suggesting that a careful choice of pseudomonad-cereal combinations might be beneficial to biocontrol. Our approach may be useful for selective single-cell level analysis of plant effects in other bacteria-root interactions."

"20442002","abstracttext","Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) of DNA is a simple, cost effective, and rapid method for the specific detection of genomic DNA using a set of six oligonucleotide primers with eight binding sites hybridizing specifically to different regions of a target gene, and a thermophilic DNA polymerase from Geobacillus stearothermophilus for DNA amplification. The method has been applied in various assays for the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections of humans and animals, sexing of bovine and swine embryos, and in the detection of bacteria from environmental samples. Only recently, first applications for fungal organisms were published. During the current study a LAMP assay was developed for the specific detection of Fusarium graminearum, the major causative agent of Fusarium head blight of small cereals and producer of the mycotoxins deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, and zearalenone. The assay was based on the gaoA gene (galactose oxidase) of the fungus. Amplification of DNA during the reaction was indirectly detected in situ by using calcein fluorescence as a marker without the necessity of time-consuming electrophoretic analysis. The assay was optimized for rapidness, specificity, and sensitivity and was shown to detect the presence of less than 2pg of purified target DNA per reaction within 30 min. Within 132 fungal species tested, exclusively DNA isolated from cultures of F. graminearum (lineages 1-9) resulted in a fluorescent signal after amplification with the LAMP assay. The method was demonstrated to be useful in the analysis of fungal cultures by direct analysis of surface scrapings from agar plate cultures, direct testing of single infected barley grains, and detection of F. graminearum in total genomic DNA isolated from bulk samples of ground wheat grains. Results obtained indicate that LAMP offers an interesting new assay format for the rapid and specific DNA-based detection and identification of agriculturally important toxigenic fungi in pure cultures and in contaminated sample materials and therefore presents an alternative to PCR-based assays."

"20448474","abstracttext","The plant-specific transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3) or the maize ortholog VIVIPAROUS1 (VP1) is known to regulate seed maturation and germination in concert with the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) but is also evolutionarily conserved among land plants including non-seed plants. An ABI3/VP1 ortholog (PpABI3A) from the moss Physcomitrella patens can activate ABA-responsive gene promoters in the moss and angiosperms; however, it failed to fully complement the phenotypes of the Arabidopsis abi3-6 mutant, suggesting that some aspects of ABI3/VP1 functions have diverged during the evolution of land plants. To gain insights into the evolution of ABI3/VP1 function, we performed a comparative analysis of the regulatory elements required for ABI3 activation in Physcomitrella using a wheat Em gene promoter, which is induced by ABA and ABI3/VP1 both in Physcomitrella and in angiosperms. Elimination of either the ACGT core motif in the ABA response element (ABRE) or the RY element, to which ABI3/VP1 binds directly, resulted in a drastic reduction of the ABA response in Physcomitrella. Arabidopsis ABI3 could effectively activate the Em promoter either in an ABRE- or RY-dependent manner, as observed in angiosperms. On the other hand, PpABI3A failed to activate an Em promoter lacking the RY element but not the ABRE. These results suggest that RY-mediated transcriptional regulation of ABI3/VP1 is evolutionarily conserved between the moss and angiosperms, whereas angiosperm ABI3/VP1 has evolved to activate ABA-inducible promoters via the ABRE sequence independently from the RY element."

"19826773","abstracttext","Barley seed proteins, Hordoindolines, are homologues of wheat Puroindolines, which are associated with grain hardness. Barley Hordoindoline genes are known to comprise Hina and Hinb, and Hinb consists of two Hinb genes, Hinb-1 and Hinb-2. Two types of allele were found for Hina, Hinb-1 and Hinb-2 genes, respectively, among Japanese two- and six-rowed barley lines. One of the alleles of Hinb-2 (Hinb-2b) had a frame-shift mutation resulting in an in-frame stop codon. For two-rowed barley lines, grain hardness was significantly higher among lines with the Hinb-2b than those with the wild type Hinb-2 gene (Hinb-2a). Protein spots corresponding to HINa, HINb-1, and HINb-2 were identified by 2D-gel electrophoresis among barley lines with Hinb-2a. Among the lines with Hinb-2b, HINa and HINb-1 were expressed at similar levels as those in the wild type, but HINb-2 was not detected. A DNA (cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence) marker was developed to distinguish between the Hinb-2a and Hinb-2b gene sequences. Analysis of grain hardness among F(2) lines derived from a cross between a line with Hinb-2a (Shikoku hadaka 115) and a line with the Hinb-2b (Shikoku hadaka 84) showed significantly higher grain hardness in the mutant lines. From these results, the Hinb-2b frame-shift (null) mutation might play a critical role in barley grain hardness. The DNA marker will be useful in barley breeding to select lines having harder grain texture."

"19778405","abstracttext","Pretreatment of lower H(2)O(2) doses (0.05, 0.5 and 5 mM) for 24 h was able to dose-dependently attenuate lipid peroxidation in wheat seedling leaves mediated by further oxidative damage elicited by higher dose of H(2)O(2) (150 mM) for 6 h, with 0.5 mM H(2)O(2) being the most effective concentrations. Further results illustrated that 0.5 mM H(2)O(2) pretreatment triggered the biphasic production of H(2)O(2) during a 24 h period. We also noticed that only peak I (0.25 h) rather than peak II (4 h) was approximately consistent with the enhancement of heme oxygenase (HO) activity, HO-1 gene expression. Meanwhile, enhanced superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, Mn-SOD and Cu,Zn-SOD transcripts might be a potential source of peak I of endogenous H(2)O(2). Further results confirmed that 0.5 mM H(2)O(2) treatment for 0.5 h was able to upregulate HO gene expression, which was detected by enzyme activity determination, semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. Meanwhile, the application of N,N'-dimethylthiourea, a trap for endogenous H(2)O(2), not only blocked the upregulation of HO, but also reversed the corresponding oxidation attenuation. Together, the above results suggest that endogenous H(2)O(2) production (peak I) plays a positive role in the induction of HO by enhancing its mRNA level and protein expression, thus leading to the acclimation to oxidative stress."

"19769694","abstracttext","Most plant pathogens present complex life cycles, in which the clonal reproduction may impede the delimitation of population entities. By studying the genetic structure of the wheat yellow rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (PST), we highlighted difficulties impeding population delimitation in highly clonal species. Despite the high dispersal potential of PST, southern France isolates were shown to be divergent from a northwestern European population. A 2-year survey was performed in the Mediterranean region to assess the geographic distribution of southern isolates: 453 isolates collected in 11 countries were genotyped using 15 simple sequence repeat markers. A subsample was analysed for virulence against 23 resistance genes. The dominant strain in the western Mediterranean region was further studied with amplified fragment length polymorphism markers to test for a geographic substructure. Both 'individual'- and 'population'-centred analyses of polymorphism markers revealed two south-specific groups: a predominant group, with a broad variability and a wide distribution in both western and eastern Mediterranean countries, and a minor group in the western Mediterranean. The east-west gradient of genetic diversity suggested gene flow from the Middle East with subsequent founder effects and genetic divergence, and demonstrated the local survival of a western Mediterranean population. The high frequency of the resistance gene Yr8 observed in cultivars from Tunisia and Algeria may contribute to maintain the north/south structure observed in France. In addition to migration and local adaptation, the dynamics of clonal lineage diversification and replacement should be considered to define population entities in strongly clonal species."

We found strong evidence for seven shared segmental genome duplications, corresponding to more than 50% of the segmental genome duplications previously determined in rice. Analysis of synonymous substitution rates (Ks) suggested that shared duplications originated before the divergence of these two species. While major genome rearrangements affected the ancestral genome of both species, small paracentric inversions were found to be species specific."

"19679197","abstracttext","Human lysosomal protective protein/cathepsin A (CathA) is a multifunctional protein that exhibits not only protective functions as to lysosomal glycosidases, i.e., neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) and beta-galactosidase (GLB), but also its own serine carboxypeptidase activity, and exhibits conserved structural similarity to yeast and wheat homologs (CPY and CPW). Our previous study revealed that the R344 (Arg344) residue in CathA could contribute to the binding and recognition of the serine peptidase inhibitor chymostatin. We examined here the effects of substitution of R344 with other amino acids, including A, D, E, G, I, K, M, N, P, Q, S, and V, denoted as R344X, including the wild-type CathA, on expression of CathA activity and intracellular processing. Among the mutant gene products, the 54-kDa precursor/zymogen with the R344D substitution was not processed to the 32/20-kDa mature form with CathA activity in a fibroblastic cell line derived from a galactosialidosis patient. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the total twelve R344X mutants and the wild-type revealed that only R344D takes on a significantly different conformation of S293-D295 in the excision peptide (M285-R298) compared to the other R344X mutants; the side chains of S293 and D295 in R344D are exposed on the molecular surface, although those in the other twelve R344X mutants are buried inside the protein. The results of the current work strongly suggest that the distinct conformational change of the S293-D295 region in the R344D protein causes the processing defect of the 54-kDa precursor of the R344D mutant gene product in cultured cells."

"19847391","abstracttext","Natural variation in wheat requirement of long exposures to cold temperatures to accelerate flowering (vernalization) is mainly controlled by the Vrn-1, Vrn-2, Vrn-3, and Vrn-4 loci. The first three loci have been well characterized, but limited information is available for Vrn-4. So far, natural variation for Vrn-4 has been detected only in the D genome (Vrn-D4), and genetic stocks for this gene are available in Triple Dirk (TDF, hereafter). We detected heterogeneity in the Vrn-1 alleles present in different TDF stocks, which may explain inconsistencies among previous studies. A correct TDF seed stock from Japan carrying recessive vrn-A1, vrn-B1, and vrn-D1 alleles was crossed with three different winter cultivars to generate F(2) mapping populations. Most of the variation in flowering time in these three populations was controlled by a single locus, Vrn-D4, which was mapped within a 1.8 cM interval flanked by markers Xcfd78 and Xbarc205 in the centromeric region of chromosome 5D. A factorial ANOVA for heading time using Vrn-D4 alleles and vernalization as factors showed a significant interaction (P < 0.0001), which confirmed that the Vrn-D4 effect on flowering time is modulated by vernalization. Comparison of the different Triple Dirk stocks revealed that Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, and Vrn-D4 all have a small residual response to vernalization, but Vrn-D4 differs from the other two in its response to short vernalization periods. The precise mapping and characterization of Vrn-D4 presented here represent a first step toward the positional cloning of this gene."

"19183860","abstracttext","Eyespot is a fungal disease of the stem base of cereal crops and causes lodging and the premature ripening of grain. Wheat cultivar Cappelle Desprez contains a highly durable eyespot resistance gene, Pch2 on the long arm of chromosome 7A. A cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) platform was used to identify genes differentially expressed between the eyespot susceptible variety Chinese Spring (CS) and the CS chromosome substitution line Cappelle Desprez 7A (CS/CD7A) which contains Pch2. Induced and constitutive gene expression was examined to compare differences between non-infected and plants infected with Oculimacula acuformis. Only 34 of approximately 4,700 cDNA-AFLP fragments were differentially expressed between CS and CS/CD7A. Clones were obtained for 29 fragments, of which four had homology to proteins involved with plant defence responses. Fourteen clones mapped to chromosome 7A and three of these mapped in the region of Pch2 making them putative candidates for involvement in eyespot resistance. Of particular importance are two fragments; 4CD7A8 and 19CD7A4, which have homology to an Oryza sativa putative callose synthase protein and a putative cereal cyst nematode NBS-LRR disease resistance protein (RCCN) respectively. Differential expression associated with Pch2 was examined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Of those genes tested, only four were differentially expressed at 14 days post inoculation. We therefore suggest that a majority of the differences in the cDNA-AFLP profiles are due to allelic polymorphisms between CS and CD alleles rather than differences in expression."

"19573234","abstracttext_background","The Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) is an important insect pest of wheat. It has tractable genetics, polytene chromosomes, and a small genome (158 Mb). Investigation of the Hessian fly presents excellent opportunities to study plant-insect interactions and the molecular mechanisms underlying genome imprinting and chromosome elimination. A physical map is needed to improve the ability to perform both positional cloning and comparative genomic analyses with the fully sequenced genomes of other dipteran species."
"19573234","abstracttext_results","An FPC-based genome wide physical map of the Hessian fly was constructed and anchored to the insect's polytene chromosomes. Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones corresponding to 12-fold coverage of the Hessian fly genome were fingerprinted, using high information content fingerprinting (HIFC) methodology, and end-sequenced. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) co-localized two BAC clones from each of the 196 longest contigs on the polytene chromosomes. An additional 70 contigs were positioned using a single FISH probe. The 266 FISH mapped contigs were evenly distributed and covered 60% of the genome (95,668 kb). The ends of the fingerprinted BACs were then sequenced to develop the capacity to create sequenced tagged site (STS) markers on the BACs in the map. Only 3.64% of the BAC-end sequence was composed of transposable elements, helicases, ribosomal repeats, simple sequence repeats, and sequences of low complexity. A relatively large fraction (14.27%) of the BES was comprised of multi-copy gene sequences. Nearly 1% of the end sequence was composed of simple sequence repeats (SSRs)."
"19573234","abstracttext_conclusion","This physical map provides the foundation for high-resolution genetic mapping, map-based cloning, and assembly of complete genome sequencing data. The results indicate that restriction fragment length heterogeneity in BAC libraries used to construct physical maps lower the length and the depth of the contigs, but is not an absolute barrier to the successful application of the technology. This map will serve as a genomic resource for accelerating gene discovery, genome sequencing, and the assembly of BAC sequences. The Hessian fly BAC-clone assembly, and the names and positions of the BAC clones used in the FISH experiments are publically available at (http://genome.purdue.edu/WebAGCoL/Hfly/WebFPC/)."

"21944732","abstracttext","Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) K88 is the main bacterial cause of diarrhea in piglets around weaning and the adhesion of ETEC to the intestinal mucosa is a prerequisite step for its colonization. In this study, the adhesion of a fimbriated ETEC and a non-fimbriated E. coli (NFEC) to the intestinal cells and the activation of the innate immune system were evaluated using a porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). The impact of several feedstuffs (wheat bran (WB); casein glycomacropeptide (CGMP); mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS); locust bean extract (LB) and Aspergillus oryzae fermentation extract (AO)) on ETEC attachment and the inflammatory response were also studied. The gene expression of TLR-4; TLR-5; IL-1β; IL-8; IL-10 and TNF-α were quantified using Cyclophilin-A, as a reference gene, and related to a non-challenged treatment. The fimbriated strain was markedly better than the non-fimbriated strain at adherence to intestinal cells and inducing an inflammatory response. All the feedstuffs studied were able to reduce the adhesion of ETEC, with the greatest decrease with CGMP or MOS at highest concentration. Regarding the inflammatory response, the highest dose of WB promoted the lowest relative expression of cytokines and chemokines. All tested feedstuffs were able to reduce the adhesion of ETEC to IPEC-J2 and interfere on the innate inflammatory response; however WB should be further studied according to the beneficial results on the intestinal inflammatory process evidenced in this study."

"21829350","abstracttext","Magnaporthe oryzae is the causal agent of rice blast disease, a devastating problem worldwide. This fungus has caused breakdown of resistance conferred by newly developed commercial cultivars. To address how the rice blast fungus adapts itself to new resistance genes so quickly, we examined chromosomal locations of AVR-Pita, a subtelomeric gene family corresponding to the Pita resistance gene, in various isolates of M. oryzae (including wheat and millet pathogens) and its related species. We found that AVR-Pita (AVR-Pita1 and AVR-Pita2) is highly variable in its genome location, occurring in chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and supernumerary chromosomes, particularly in rice-infecting isolates. When expressed in M. oryzae, most of the AVR-Pita homologs could elicit Pita-mediated resistance, even those from non-rice isolates. AVR-Pita was flanked by a retrotransposon, which presumably contributed to its multiple translocation across the genome. On the other hand, family member AVR-Pita3, which lacks avirulence activity, was stably located on chromosome 7 in a vast majority of isolates. These results suggest that the diversification in genome location of AVR-Pita in the rice isolates is a consequence of recognition by Pita in rice. We propose a model that the multiple translocation of AVR-Pita may be associated with its frequent loss and recovery mediated by its transfer among individuals in asexual populations. This model implies that the high mobility of AVR-Pita is a key mechanism accounting for the rapid adaptation toward Pita. Dynamic adaptation of some fungal plant pathogens may be achieved by deletion and recovery of avirulence genes using a population as a unit of adaptation."
"21829384","articletitle","Quantitative and qualitative stem rust resistance factors in barley are associated with transcriptional suppression of defense regulons."
"21829384","abstracttext","Stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici; Pgt) is a devastating fungal disease of wheat and barley. Pgt race TTKSK (isolate Ug99) is a serious threat to these Triticeae grain crops because resistance is rare. In barley, the complex Rpg-TTKSK locus on chromosome 5H is presently the only known source of qualitative resistance to this aggressive Pgt race. Segregation for resistance observed on seedlings of the Q21861 × SM89010 (QSM) doubled-haploid (DH) population was found to be predominantly qualitative, with little of the remaining variance explained by loci other than Rpg-TTKSK. In contrast, analysis of adult QSM DH plants infected by field inoculum of Pgt race TTKSK in Njoro, Kenya, revealed several additional quantitative trait loci that contribute to resistance. To molecularly characterize these loci, Barley1 GeneChips were used to measure the expression of 22,792 genes in the QSM population after inoculation with Pgt race TTKSK or mock-inoculation. Comparison of expression Quantitative Trait Loci (eQTL) between treatments revealed an inoculation-dependent expression polymorphism implicating Actin depolymerizing factor3 (within the Rpg-TTKSK locus) as a candidate susceptibility gene. In parallel, we identified a chromosome 2H trans-eQTL hotspot that co-segregates with an enhancer of Rpg-TTKSK-mediated, adult plant resistance discovered through the Njoro field trials. Our genome-wide eQTL studies demonstrate that transcript accumulation of 25% of barley genes is altered following challenge by Pgt race TTKSK, but that few of these genes are regulated by the qualitative Rpg-TTKSK on chromosome 5H. It is instead the chromosome 2H trans-eQTL hotspot that orchestrates the largest inoculation-specific responses, where enhanced resistance is associated with transcriptional suppression of hundreds of genes scattered throughout the genome. Hence, the present study associates the early suppression of genes expressed in this host-pathogen interaction with enhancement of R-gene mediated resistance."

"21840698","abstracttext","The consumption of synbiotics, a mixture of probiotics and indigestible food constituents such as dietary fiber, has been reported to reduce colon cancer risk. We investigated the effects of fermented wheat aleurone enriched with the probiotics Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG/Bifidobacterium animalis supsp. lactis on the gene expression and functional end points related to cellular defence in HT29 and primary human colon cells. Aleurone was digested and fermented in vitro with/without probiotics. The resulting fermentation supernatants (fs) were analyzed for concentrations of deoxycholic acid and ammonia. The cells were treated with the fs, and effects on gene expression of catalase, GSTP1 and SULT2B1, enzyme activity of catalase and glutathione S-transferase as well as H₂O₂-induced DNA damage were examined. Fermentation of aleurone reduced deoxycholic acid concentration by 84%, while the probiotics enhanced this effect. Ammonia was increased by fs aleurone, whereas a reduction occurred by the addition of L. rhamnosus GG/B. animalis supsp. lactis 12. GSTP1 expression tended to result in an increase by the fs aleurone in both cell types, whereas the probiotics could not additionally increase the effect. Catalase was not modulated by fs aleurone enriched with probiotics. Only in HT29 cells, expression of SULT2B1 was enhanced by fs aleurone. Enzyme activity of catalase and glutathione S-transferase was induced (2-3.6 fold, 72 h) in HT29 cells only. Addition of probiotics had no influence on this effect. In HT29 cells, a reduced H₂O₂-induced DNA damage by the fs aleurone after 48 h, enhanced by the addition of probiotics, was detected. The observed effects could improve detoxification of xenobiotics and therefore may lower colon cancer risk."

"21883212","abstracttext","Polycystic kidney disease 1-like 3 (Pkd1l3) is expressed specifically in sour-sensing type III taste cells that have synaptic contacts with afferent nerve fibers in circumvallate (CvP) and foliate papillae (FoP) located in the posterior region of the tongue, although not in fungiform papillae (FuP) or the palate. To visualize the gustatory neural pathways that originate from type III taste cells in CvP and FoP, we established transgenic mouse lines that express the transneuronal tracer wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) under the control of the mouse Pkd1l3 gene promoter/enhancer. The WGA transgene was accurately expressed in Pkd1l3-expressing type III taste cells in CvP and FoP. Punctate WGA protein signals appeared to be detected specifically in type III taste cells but not in other types of taste cells. WGA protein was transferred primarily to a subset of neurons located in close proximity to the glossopharyngeal (GL) nerve bundles in the nodose/petrosal ganglion (NPG). WGA signals were also observed in a small population of neurons in the geniculate ganglion (GG). This result demonstrates the anatomical connection between taste receptor cells (TRCs) in the FoP and the chorda tympani (CT) nerves. WGA protein was further conveyed to neurons in a rostro-central subdivision of the nucleus of the solitary tract (NST). These findings demonstrate that the approximately 10 kb 5'-flanking region of the mouse Pkd1l3 gene functions as a type III taste cell-specific promoter/enhancer. In addition, experiments using the pkd1l3-WGA transgenic mice reveal a sour gustatory pathway that originates from TRCs in the posterior region of the tongue."

"21890005","abstracttext","Although several xylanases have been studied, only few xylanases from marine micro-organisms have been reported. We report here a novel halotolerant xylanase from marine bacterium Bacillus subtilis cho40 isolated from Chorao island of mandovi estuary Goa, India. Extracellular xylanase was produced by using agricultural residue such as wheat bran as carbon source under solid-state fermentation (SSF). The optimal pH and temperature of xylanase were reported to be 6.0 and 60°C, respectively. Xyn40 was highly salt-tolerant, and showed highest activity at 0.5M NaCl. Xylanase activity was greatly induced (140%) when pre-incubated with 0.5M NaCl for 4h. The xylanase gene, xyn40, from marine bacterium B. subtilis cho40 was cloned, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The xylanase gene was 645 bp long and had a 215 amino acid ORF protein with a molecular mass of 22.9 kDa. It had all features of xylanase enzyme and showed homology to xylanases reported from B. subtilis. It differs from the earlier reported xylanase sequences by the presence of more serine residues compared to threonine and also by the presence of polar (hydrophilic) amino acids in higher abundance (61%) than non-polar amino acids (39%). The novel xylanase, reported in this study is a halotolerant enzyme from marine isolate and can play a very important role in bioethanol production from marine seaweeds."

"21896773","abstracttext","One of the solutions for reducing the global mortality and morbidity due to malaria is multivalent vaccines comprising antigens of several life cycle stages of the malarial parasite. Hence, there is a need for supplementing the current set of malaria vaccine candidate antigens. Here, we aimed to characterize glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored micronemal antigen (GAMA) encoded by the PF08_0008 gene in Plasmodium falciparum. Antibodies were raised against recombinant GAMA synthesized by using a wheat germ cell-free system. Immunoelectron microscopy demonstrated for the first time that GAMA is a microneme protein of the merozoite. Erythrocyte binding assays revealed that GAMA possesses an erythrocyte binding epitope in the C-terminal region and it binds a nonsialylated protein receptor on human erythrocytes. Growth inhibition assays revealed that anti-GAMA antibodies can inhibit P. falciparum invasion in a dose-dependent manner and GAMA plays a role in the sialic acid (SA)-independent invasion pathway. Anti-GAMA antibodies in combination with anti-erythrocyte binding antigen 175 exhibited a significantly higher level of invasion inhibition, supporting the rationale that targeting of both SA-dependent and SA-independent ligands/pathways is better than targeting either of them alone. Human sera collected from areas of malaria endemicity in Mali and Thailand recognized GAMA. Since GAMA in P. falciparum is refractory to gene knockout attempts, it is essential to parasite invasion. Overall, our study indicates that GAMA is a novel blood-stage vaccine candidate antigen."

"23567029","articletitle","Necrophytoremediation of phenanthrene and pyrene in contaminated soil."
"23567029","abstracttext","In this study, the effect of necrophytoremediation, using pea and wheat straws on the remediation soil contaminated with two common polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), phenanthrene and pyrene alone or in combination was investigated. In addition, monitoring of the population of PAH-utilising microorganisms together with PCR-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE)-sequencing methods were used to further elucidate the effect of straw addition on the bacterial, fungal and nidA gene (a functional gene involved in the degradation of PAHs) communities. The addition of pea straw had a positive effect on the degradation of PAHs, especially for pyrene. For example, the addition of pea straw to pyrene-contaminated soil resulted in an increase in the degradation of pyrene from 15% (66 mg kg(-1)) in the corresponding control to 70% (301 mg kg(-1)). The results from the most probable number (MPN) of PAH-utilising microorganisms and PCR-DGGE-sequencing methods indicated that the addition of straw led to an increase in microbial hydrocarbonoclastic biomass rather than changes in microbial diversity. For example, in pyrene-contaminated soil, the number of PAH-utilising microorganisms in the soil amended with pea straw reached 5.6 log10 CFU g(-1) dry soil, ~13-fold increase when compared with the numbers present in the control soil (4.5 log10 CFU g(-1) dry soils); however, the Shannon diversity index did not increase significantly. The sequencing of bands of interest from DGGE profiles revealed the presence of Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in the bacterial community. For fungi, sequenced bands belonged to Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mucoromycotina. In summary, this study has shown that necrophytoremediation using pea straw represents a promising biostimulation and cost effective agent which can be used for the bioremediation of PAH-contaminated soils."

In contrast to the human genome that contains two genes, plant GSKs are encoded by a multigene family. Little is known about Liliopsida resp. Poaceae in comparison to Brassicaceae GSKs. Here, we report the identification and structural characterization of two GSK homologs named TaSK1 and TaSK2 in the hexaploid wheat genome as well as a widespread phylogenetic analysis of land plant GSKs."

A phylogenetic analysis of land plant GSKs indicated that TaSK1 and TaSK2 belong to clade II of plant GSKs, the Arabidopsis members of which are all involved in Brassinosteroid signaling.

"22924020","abstracttext","Artificially induced translocation stocks have been used to physically map the barley genome; however, natural translocations are extremely uncommon in cultivated genotypes. Albacete is a barley variety widely grown in recent decades in Spain and carrying a reciprocal translocation which obviously does not affect its agronomical fitness. This translocation has been characterized by a combination of cytological and molecular genetic approaches. Firstly, recombination frequencies between markers on chromosomes 1H and 3H were estimated to determine the boundaries of the reciprocal interchange. Secondly, 1H-3H wheat barley telosome addition lines were used to assign selected markers to chromosome arms. Thirdly, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with rDNA probes (5S and 18S-5.8S-26S) and microsatellite probes [(ACT)(5), (AAG)(5) and (CAG)(5)] was used to determine the locations of the translocation breakpoints more precisely. Fourthly, fine-mapping of the regions around the translocation breakpoints was used to increase the marker density for comparative genomics. The results obtained in this study indicate that the translocation is quite large with breakpoints located on the long arms of chromosomes 1H and 3H, between the pericentromeric (AAG)(5) bands and above the (ACT)(5) interstitial distal bands, resulting in the reciprocal translocation 1HS.1HL-3HL and 3HS.3HL-1HL. The gene content around the translocation breakpoints could be inferred from syntenic relationships observed among different species from the grass family Poaceae (rice, Sorghum and Brachypodium) and was estimated at approximately 1,100 and 710 gene models for 1H and 3H, respectively. Duplicated segments between chromosomes Os01 and Os05 in rice derived from ancestral duplications within the grass family overlap with the translocation breakpoints on chromosomes 1H and 3H in the barley variety Albacete."
"19221880","articletitle","Genomic and functional characterization of StCDPK1."
"19221880","abstracttext","StCDPK1 is a calcium dependent protein kinase expressed in tuberizing potato stolons and in sprouting tubers. StCDPK1 genomic sequence contains eight exons and seven introns, the gene structure is similar to Arabidopsis, rice and wheat CDPKs belonging to subgroup IIa. There is one copy of the gene per genome and it is located in the distal portion of chromosome 12. Western blot and immunolocalization assays (using confocal and transmission electron microscopy) performed with a specific antibody against StCDPK1 indicate that this kinase is mainly located in the plasma membrane of swelling stolons and sprouting tubers. Sucrose (4-8%) increased StCDPK1 protein content in non-induced stolons, however the amount detected in swelling stolons was higher. Transgenic lines with reduced expression of StCDPK1 (beta 7) did not differ from controls when cultured under multiplication conditions, but when grown under tuber inducing conditions some significant differences were observed: the beta 7 line tuberized earlier than controls without the addition of CCC (GA inhibitor), developed more tubers than wild type plants in the presence of hormones that promote tuberization in potato (ABA and BAP) and was more insensitive to GA action (stolons were significantly shorter than those of control plants). StCDPK1 expression was induced by GA, ABA and BAP. Our results suggest that StCDPK1 plays a role in GA-signalling and that this kinase could be a converging point for the inhibitory and promoting signals that influence the onset of potato tuberization."
"19360392","articletitle","Simultaneous selection of major and minor genes: use of QTL to increase selection efficiency of coleoptile length of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"19360392","abstracttext","Plant breeders simultaneously select for qualitative traits controlled by one or a small number of major genes, as well as for polygenic traits controlled by multiple genes that may be detected as quantitative trait loci (QTL). In this study, we applied computer simulation to investigate simultaneous selection for alleles at both major and minor gene (as QTL) loci in breeding populations of two wheat parental lines, HM14BS and Sunstate. Loci targeted for selection included six major genes affecting plant height, disease resistance, and grain quality, plus 6 known and 11 ""unidentified"" QTL affecting coleoptile length (CL). Parental line HM14BS contributed the target alleles at two of the major gene loci, while parental line Sunstate contributed target alleles at four loci. The parents have similar plant height, but HM14BS has a longer coleoptile, a desirable attribute for deep sowing in rainfed environments. Including the wild-type allele at the major reduced-height locus Rht-D1, HM14BS was assumed to have 13 QTL for increased CL, and Sunstate four; these assumptions being derived from mapping studies and empirical data from an actual HM14BS/Sunstate population. Simulation indicated that compared to backcross populations, a single biparental F(1) cross produced the highest frequency of target genotypes (six desired alleles at major genes plus desired QTL alleles for long CL). From 1,000 simulation runs, an average of 2.4 individuals with the target genotype were present in unselected F(1)-derived doubled haploid (DH) or recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations of size 200. A selection scheme for the six major genes increased the number of target individuals to 19.1, and additional marker-assisted selection (MAS) for CL increased the number to 23.0. Phenotypic selection (PS) of CL outperformed MAS in this study due to the high heritability of CL, incompletely linked markers for known QTL, and the existence of unidentified QTL. However, a selection scheme combining MAS and PS was equally as efficient as PS and would result in net savings in production and time to delivery of long coleoptile wheats containing the six favorable alleles."
"20957229","articletitle","A network approach to predict pathogenic genes for Fusarium graminearum."
"20957229","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the pathogenic agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB), which is a destructive disease on wheat and barley, thereby causing huge economic loss and health problems to human by contaminating foods. Identifying pathogenic genes can shed light on pathogenesis underlying the interaction between F. graminearum and its plant host. However, it is difficult to detect pathogenic genes for this destructive pathogen by time-consuming and expensive molecular biological experiments in lab. On the other hand, computational methods provide an alternative way to solve this problem. Since pathogenesis is a complicated procedure that involves complex regulations and interactions, the molecular interaction network of F. graminearum can give clues to potential pathogenic genes. Furthermore, the gene expression data of F. graminearum before and after its invasion into plant host can also provide useful information. In this paper, a novel systems biology approach is presented to predict pathogenic genes of F. graminearum based on molecular interaction network and gene expression data. With a small number of known pathogenic genes as seed genes, a subnetwork that consists of potential pathogenic genes is identified from the protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) of F. graminearum, where the genes in the subnetwork are further required to be differentially expressed before and after the invasion of the pathogenic fungus. Therefore, the candidate genes in the subnetwork are expected to be involved in the same biological processes as seed genes, which imply that they are potential pathogenic genes. The prediction results show that most of the pathogenic genes of F. graminearum are enriched in two important signal transduction pathways, including G protein coupled receptor pathway and MAPK signaling pathway, which are known related to pathogenesis in other fungi. In addition, several pathogenic genes predicted by our method are verified in other pathogenic fungi, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results presented in this paper not only can provide guidelines for future experimental verification, but also shed light on the pathogenesis of the destructive fungus F. graminearum."
"20920202","articletitle","Unusual conservation among genes encoding small secreted salivary gland proteins from a gall midge."
"20920202","abstracttext_background","In most protein-coding genes, greater sequence variation is observed in noncoding regions (introns and untranslated regions) than in coding regions due to selective constraints. During characterization of genes and transcripts encoding small secreted salivary gland proteins (SSSGPs) from the Hessian fly, we found exactly the opposite pattern of conservation in several families of genes: the non-coding regions were highly conserved, but the coding regions were highly variable."
"20920202","abstracttext_results","Seven genes from the SSSGP-1 family are clustered as one inverted and six tandem repeats within a 15 kb region of the genome. Except for SSSGP-1A2, a gene that encodes a protein identical to that encoded by SSSGP-1A1, the other six genes consist of a highly diversified, mature protein-coding region as well as highly conserved regions including the promoter, 5'- and 3'-UTRs, a signal peptide coding region, and an intron. This unusual pattern of highly diversified coding regions coupled with highly conserved regions in the rest of the gene was also observed in several other groups of SSSGP-encoding genes or cDNAs. The unusual conservation pattern was also found in some of the SSSGP cDNAs from the Asian rice gall midge, but not from the orange wheat blossom midge. Strong positive selection was one of the forces driving for diversification whereas concerted homogenization was likely a mechanism for sequence conservation."
"20920202","abstracttext_conclusion","Rapid diversification in mature SSSGPs suggests that the genes are under selection pressure for functional adaptation. The conservation in the noncoding regions of these genes including introns also suggested potential mechanisms for sequence homogenization that are not yet fully understood. This report should be useful for future studies on genetic mechanisms involved in evolution and functional adaptation of parasite genes."

"21074885","abstracttext","A total of 2177 food samples collected from nine cities in northern China during 2005 to 2007 were screened for the presence of Listeria monocytogenes. All L. monocytogenes isolates were subjected to serotyping, antimicrobial susceptibility, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), as well as PCR screening to identify genes responsible for tetracycline resistance [tet(L), tet(M), tet(K), tet(S) and tet(B)], transposon Tn916, and class 1 integron. Contamination with L. monocytogenes was detected in 4.13% (90/2177) of the total samples representing various food products. The pathogen was mainly isolated from frozen food made of wheat flour or rice products (26/252, 10.32%) and raw meat products (46/733, 6.28%). Besides, 3.31% (10/302) of cooked meat, 1.17% (4/343) of seafood, 0.98% (2/204) of non-fermented bean products and 0.62% (2/323) of vegetables samples were contaminated by this bacterium. The L. monocytogenes isolates belonged to five serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b, 1/2c, 4b, and 3a), with serotype 1/2a being dominant (48.88%). Antimicrobial resistance was most frequently observed for ciprofloxacin (17.8%), tetracycline (15.6%) and streptomycin (12.2%). Overall, resistance was observed against 14 out of 18 antimicrobials tested while multiple resistances occurred among 18.9% (17/90) isolates. Interestingly, two isolates were resistant to more than five antimicrobials. Among 14 tetracycline-resistant isolates, 13 carried tet(M) gene including nine possessing Tn916, and one harbored tet(S) gene. PFGE analysis revealed genetic heterogeneity among individual serotypes as well as scattered occurrence of some genotypes without any clear-cut correlation to source or food type. The widespread distribution of epidemiologically important serotypes (1/2a, 1/2b and 4b) of L. monocytogenes, and their resistance to commonly used antibiotics indicate a potential public health risk. Our data also indicate that L. monocytogenes could act as a reservoir of mobile tet genes along the food chain."

"20823341","abstracttext","Perception of red light (400 μmol photon m²/s) by the shoot bottom turned off the greening process in wheat. To understand the signaling cascade leading to this photomorphogenic response, certain signaling components were probed in seedlings grown in different light regimes. Upon analysis the gene expression of heterotrimeric Gα and Gβ were severely down-regulated in seedlings grown without vermiculite and having their shoot bottom exposed to red light (R/V-) and was similar to that of dark-grown seedlings. Supplementing the red-light-grown V- seedlings with blue light resulted in up-regulation of both Gα and Gβ expression, suggesting that blue light is able to modulate G protein expression. Treatment of cytokinin analog benzyladenine to cytokinin-deficient red-light-grown R/V- seedlings resulted in up-regulation of gene expression of both Gα and Gβ. To probe further, modulators of signal transduction pathway--AlF₃ (G protein activator), LaCl₃ (Ca(2+) channel blocker), NaF (nonspecific phosphatase inhibitor), or calmodulin (CaM) antagonists trifluoperazine (TFP) and N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-nafthalene-sulfonamide (W-7)--were added along with Hoagland solution to the roots of 4-day-old etiolated seedlings, grown on germination paper and transferred to red light. AlF₃, LaCl₃, NaF failed to elicit any photomorphogenic response. However, CaM antagonists TFP and W-7 significantly reversed the red-light-induced suppression of photomorphogenesis. Phosphorylation of proteins assayed in the absence or presence of CaM antagonist TFP revealed respective up-regulation or down-regulation of phosphorylation of several plastidic proteins in R/V- seedlings. These suggest that signal transduction of red light perceived by the shoot bottom to suppress photomorphogenesis is mediated by CaM-dependent protein kinases."

"21169453","abstracttext","The trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is a common contaminant of small grains, such as wheat and barley, in the United States. New strategies to mitigate the threat of DON need to be developed and implemented. TRI101 and TRI201 are trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferases that are able to modify DON and reduce its toxicity. Recent work has highlighted differences in the activities of TRI101 from two different species of Fusarium (F. graminearum and F. sporotrichioides), but little is known about the relative activities of TRI101/TRI201 enzymes produced by other species of Fusarium. We cloned TRI101 or TRI201 genes from seven different species of Fusarium and found genetic identity between sequences ranging from 66% to 98%. In vitro feeding studies using transformed yeast showed that all of the TRI101/TRI201 enzymes tested were able to acetylate DON; conversion of DON to 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3ADON) ranged from 50.5% to 100.0%, depending on the Fusarium species from which the gene originated. A time course assay showed that the rate of acetylation varied from species to species, with the gene from F. sporotrichioides having the lowest rate. Steady-state kinetic assays using seven purified enzymes produced catalytic efficiencies for DON acetylation ranging from 6.8 × 10(4) M(-1)·s(-1) to 4.7 × 10(6) M(-1)·s(-1). Thermostability measurements for the seven orthologs ranged from 37.1°C to 43.2°C. Extended sequence analysis of portions of TRI101/TRI201 from 31 species of Fusarium (including known trichothecene producers and nonproducers) suggested that other members of the genus may contain functional TRI101/TRI201 genes, some with the potential to outperform those evaluated in the present study."

"21243443","abstracttext","A putative α-amylase gene, designated as RoAmy, was cloned from Rhizopus oryzae. The deduced amino acid sequence showed the highest (42.8%) similarity to the α-amylase from Trichoderma viride. The RoAmy gene was successfully expressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 under the induction of methanol. The molecular weight of the purified RoAmy determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was approximately 48 kDa. The optimal pH and temperature were 4-6 and 60 °C, respectively. The enzyme was stable at pH ranges of 4.5-6.5 and temperatures below 50 °C. Purified RoAmy had a K(m) and V(max) of 0.27 mg/ml and 0.068 mg/min, respectively, with a specific activity of 1,123 U/mg on soluble starch. Amylase activity was strongly inhibited by 5 mM Cu(2+) and 5 mM Fe(2+), whereas 5 mM Ca(2+) showed no significant effect. The RoAmy hydrolytic activity was the highest on wheat starch but showed only 55% activity on amylopectin relative to soluble corn starch, while the pullulanase activity was negligible. The main end products of the polysaccharides tested were glucose and maltose. Maltose reached a concentration of 74% (w/w) with potato starch as the substrate. The enzyme had an extremely high affinity (K(m) = 0.22 mM) to maltotriose. A high ratio of glucose/maltose of 1:4 was obtained when maltotriose was used at an initial concentration of 40 mM."

"21392918","abstracttext","Fluorescent Pseudomonas strains producing the antimicrobial secondary metabolite 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (Phl) play a prominent role in the biocontrol of plant diseases. A subset of Phl-producing fluorescent Pseudomonas strains, which can additionally synthesize the antimicrobial compound pyoluteorin (Plt), appears to cluster separately from other fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. based on 16S rRNA gene analysis and shares at most 98.4% 16S rRNA gene sequence identity with any other Pseudomonas species. In this study, a polyphasic approach based on molecular and phenotypic methods was used to clarify the taxonomy of representative Phl(+) Plt(+) strains isolated from tobacco, cotton or wheat on different continents. Phl(+) Plt(+) strains clustered separately from their nearest phylogenetic neighbors (i.e. species from the 'P. syringae', 'P. fluorescens' and 'P. chlororaphis' species complexes) based on rpoB, rpoD or gyrB phylogenies. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments clarified that Phl(+) Plt(+) strains formed a tight genomospecies that was distinct from P. syringae, P. fluorescens, or P. chlororaphis type strains. Within Phl(+) strains, the Phl(+) Plt(+) strains were differentiated from other biocontrol fluorescent Pseudomonas strains that produced Phl but not Plt, based on phenotypic and molecular data. Discriminative phenotypic characters were also identified by numerical taxonomic analysis and siderotyping. Altogether, this polyphasic approach supported the conclusion that Phl(+) Plt(+) fluorescent Pseudomonas strains belonged to a novel species for which the name Pseudomonas protegens is proposed, with CHA0(T) (=CFBP 6595(T), =DSM 19095(T)) as the type strain."

"22294493","abstracttext","It has been well known that the bacteria of the genus Azotobacter, in addition to the beneficial N(2)-fixing activity, are able to improve plant growth by a number of direct and indirect mechanisms. To identify this potential in indigenous azotobacteria, the efficiency of 17 isolates of Azotobacter from the rhizosphere of wheat and barley plants cultivated in salt- and/or drought-affected soils in Iran were evaluated for their ability to dissolve inorganic and organic phosphates, siderophore secretion, indole acetic acid (IAA) production; and protease, chitinase, and ACC deaminase (ACCD) activities. First, they were biochemically characterized and one isolate (strain) was identified by 16S rDNA sequencing. Eight isolates were designated as Azotobacter vinelandii and the remaining isolates were identified as A. chroococcum. All isolates hydrolyzed the organic and inorganic phosphate compounds and effectively produced IAA. Fifteen isolates produced siderophore, but only one isolate showed protease activity which is being reported for the first time in relation to Azotobacter. None of the 17 isolates was capable of producing ACCD or chitinase. However, polymerase chain reaction amplification of the ACCD coding genes, by the use of the gene-specific primers, indicated that not all contain the ACCD gene. The standard screening methods with slight modifications, especially in the case of ACCD assay, were applied. The results showed that the use of specific screening methods, modified according to bacterial nutritional requirements, are the efficient methods for precise evaluation of the plant growth promoting rhizobacteria activity."

"22264499","abstracttext","The purpose of the present study was to establish the prebiotic effect of a new xylo-oligosaccharide (XOS) and of an inulin-and-XOS mixture (INU-XOS) and to determine their effect on endotoxaemia (lipopolysaccharides (LPS)) and immune parameters. In this randomised, parallel, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, sixty healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to three groups, receiving either 5 g XOS, INU-XOS (3 g inulin +1 g XOS) or an equivalent weight of wheat maltodextrin (placebo) during 4 weeks. Faecal samples were collected to assess the effects of these products on microbiota, as well as SCFA composition, enzymatic activities and secretory IgA production. Circulating LPS was measured in plasma samples, and whole blood was incubated with LPS to measure cytokine expression. Consumption of XOS alone increased the faecal concentrations of Bifidobacterium and butyrate and activities of α-glucosidase and β-glucuronidase, while decreasing the concentrations of acetate and p-cresol. Consumption of XOS in combination with inulin did not decrease the concentrations of acetate and p-cresol, but increased in addition the faecal concentrations of total SCFA and propionate. Furthermore, consumption of XOS in combination with inulin decreased LPS concentrations in blood and attenuated LPS-induced increases in gene expression in IL-1β and LPS-induced decreases in gene expression in IL-13 in blood. In conclusion, consumption of XOS alone or in combination with inulin results in beneficial albeit different changes in the intestinal microbiome on a high-fat diet. In addition, consumption of XOS in combination with inulin attenuates the proinflammatory effects of a high-fat diet in the blood of healthy subjects."
"22947191","articletitle","Involvement of FgERG4 in ergosterol biosynthesis, vegetative differentiation and virulence in Fusarium graminearum."
"22947191","abstracttext","The ergosterol biosynthesis pathway is well understood in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but currently little is known about the pathway in plant-pathogenic fungi. In this study, we characterized the Fusarium graminearum FgERG4 gene encoding sterol C-24 reductase, which catalyses the conversion of ergosta-5,7,22,24-tetraenol to ergosterol in the final step of ergosterol biosynthesis. The FgERG4 deletion mutant ΔFgErg4-2 failed to synthesize ergosterol. The mutant exhibited a significant decrease in mycelial growth and conidiation, and produced abnormal conidia. In addition, the mutant showed increased sensitivity to metal cations and to various cell stresses. Surprisingly, mycelia of ΔFgErg4-2 revealed increased resistance to cell wall-degrading enzymes. Fungicide sensitivity tests revealed that ΔFgErg4-2 showed increased resistance to various sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBIs), which is consistent with the over-expression of SBI target genes in the mutant. ΔFgErg4-2 was impaired dramatically in virulence, although it was able to successfully colonize flowering wheat head and tomato, which is in agreement with the observation that the mutant produces a significantly lower level of trichothecene mycotoxins than does the wild-type progenitor. All of these phenotypic defects of ΔFgErg4-2 were complemented by the reintroduction of a full-length FgERG4 gene. In addition, FgERG4 partially rescued the defect of ergosterol biosynthesis in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ERG4 deletion mutant. Taken together, the results of this study indicate that FgERG4 plays a crucial role in ergosterol biosynthesis, vegetative differentiation and virulence in the filamentous fungus F. graminearum."

"23035824","abstracttext_background","Trichoderma reesei is a soft rot Ascomycota fungus utilised for industrial production of secreted enzymes, especially lignocellulose degrading enzymes. About 30 carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) of T. reesei have been biochemically characterised. Genome sequencing has revealed a large number of novel candidates for CAZymes, thus increasing the potential for identification of enzymes with novel activities and properties. Plenty of data exists on the carbon source dependent regulation of the characterised hydrolytic genes. However, information on the expression of the novel CAZyme genes, especially on complex biomass material, is very limited."
"23035824","abstracttext_results","In this study, the CAZyme gene content of the T. reesei genome was updated and the annotations of the genes refined using both computational and manual approaches.

Updated or novel functional predictions were assigned to 44 genes, and the phylogenetic analysis indicated further functional diversification within enzyme families or groups of enzymes. GH3 β-glucosidases, GH27 α-galactosidases and GH18 chitinases were especially functionally diverse. The expression of the lignocellulose degrading enzyme system of T. reesei was studied by cultivating the fungus in the presence of different inducing substrates and by subjecting the cultures to transcriptional profiling. The substrates included both defined and complex lignocellulose related materials, such as pretreated bagasse, wheat straw, spruce, xylan, Avicel cellulose and sophorose.

"23558982","abstracttext","Chapio is a spring wheat developed by CIMMYT in Mexico by a breeding program that focused on multigenic resistances to leaf rust and stripe rust. A population consisting of 277 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed by crossing Chapio with Avocet. The RILs were genotyped with DArT markers (137 randomly selected RILs) and bulked segregant analysis conducted to supplement the map with informative SSR markers. The final map consisted of 264 markers. Phenotyping against stripe rust was conducted for three seasons in Toluca, Mexico and at three sites over two seasons (total of four environments) in Sichuan Province, China. Significant loci across the two inter-continental regions included Lr34/Yr18 on 7DS, Sr2/Yr30 on 3BS, and a QTL on 3D. There were significant genotype × environment interactions with resistance gene Yr31 on 2BS being effective in most of the Toluca environments; however, a late incursion of a virulent pathotype in 2009 rendered this gene ineffective. This locus also had no effect in China. Conversely, a 5BL locus was only effective in the Chinese environments. There were also complex additive interactions. In the Mexican environments, Yr31 suppressed the additive effect of Yr30 and the 3D locus, but not of Lr34/Yr18, while in China, the 3D and 5BL loci were generally not additive with each other, but were additive when combined with other loci. These results indicate the importance of maintaining diverse, multi-genic resistances as Chapio had stable inter-continental resistance despite the fact that there were QTLs that were not effective in either one or the other region."

"23873998","abstracttext","Small or shrivelled wheat kernels (screenings) that reduce crop value are commonly produced in terminal drought environments. The aim of this study was to establish whether the incorporation of the tiller inhibition (tin) gene would contribute to maintenance of kernel weight and reductions in screenings under terminal water deficit. Five Silverstar near-isogenic lines contrasting in high and low tiller potential and their recurrent Silverstar parent were established at two plant densities under managed terminal water deficit (mild and severe) and irrigated conditions. With irrigation (grain yield of 5.6 t ha(-1)), kernels of all lines weighed ~31 mg, with restricted-tillering (R-tin) lines producing an average 15% lower grain yield. Under both mild and severe terminal water deficit (4.1 t ha(-1) and 2.8 t ha(-1)), free-tillering lines had relatively high screenings ranging from 11.9% to 16.2%. Compared with free-tillering lines, R-tin lines maintained large kernel weight (~29 mg kernel(-1)) and had 29% and 51% fewer screenings under the two stresses, and a significantly greater (+11%) grain yield under mild stress. Higher kernel weights in tin lines were realized even with the greater kernel number per spike. The higher kernel weight of the R-tin lines under stress conditions was associated with greater anthesis biomass and increased stem water-soluble carbohydrates, ensuring more assimilate for later translocation to filling grain. The incorporation of the tin gene into genetic material adapted to the target environments provides scope for improvement in both grain yield and kernel weight, and a reduction in screenings in terminal water deficit environments."
"23741054","articletitle","Contrasting patterns of evolution of 45S and 5S rDNA families uncover new aspects in the genome constitution of the agronomically important grass Thinopyrum intermedium (Triticeae)."
"23741054","abstracttext","We employed sequencing of clones and in situ hybridization (genomic and fluorescent in situ hybridization [GISH and rDNA-FISH]) to characterize both the sequence variation and genomic organization of 45S (herein ITS1-5.8S-ITS2 region) and 5S (5S gene + nontranscribed spacer) ribosomal DNA (rDNA) families in the allohexaploid grass Thinopyrum intermedium. Both rDNA families are organized within several rDNA loci within all three subgenomes of the allohexaploid species. Both families have undergone different patterns of evolution. The 45S rDNA family has evolved in a concerted manner: internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences residing within the arrays of two subgenomes out of three got homogenized toward one major ribotype, whereas the third subgenome contained a minor proportion of distinct unhomogenized copies. Homogenization mechanisms such as unequal crossover and/or gene conversion were coupled with the loss of certain 45S rDNA loci. Unlike in the 45S family, the data suggest that neither interlocus homogenization among homeologous chromosomes nor locus loss occurred in 5S rDNA. Consistently with other Triticeae, the 5S rDNA family in intermediate wheatgrass comprised two distinct array types-the long- and short-spacer unit classes. Within the long and short units, we distinguished five and three different types, respectively, likely representing homeologous unit classes donated by putative parental species. Although the major ITS ribotype corresponds in our phylogenetic analysis to the E-genome species, the minor ribotype corresponds to Dasypyrum. 5S sequences suggested the contributions from Pseudoroegneria, Dasypyrum, and Aegilops. The contribution from Aegilops to the intermediate wheatgrass' genome is a new finding with implications in wheat improvement. We discuss rDNA evolution and potential origin of intermediate wheatgrass."

"23819624","abstracttext_background","Ryegrasses and fescues (genera, Lolium and Festuca) are species of forage and turf grasses which are used widely in agricultural and amenity situations. They are classified within the sub-family Pooideae and so are closely related to Brachypodium distachyon, wheat, barley, rye and oats. Recently, a DArT array has been developed which can be used in generating marker and mapping information for ryegrasses and fescues. This represents a potential common marker set for ryegrass and fescue researchers which can be linked through to comparative genomic information for the grasses."
"23819624","abstracttext_results","A F2 perennial ryegrass genetic map was developed consisting of 7 linkage groups defined by 1316 markers and deriving a total map length of 683 cM.

Comparison with previous DArT mapping studies in perennial and Italian ryegrass (L. multiflorum) identified 87 and 105 DArT markers in common, respectively, of which 94% and 87% mapped to homoeologous linkage groups. A similar comparison with meadow fescue (F. pratensis) identified only 28 DArT markers in common, of which c. 50% mapped to non-homoelogous linkage groups. In L. perenne, the genetic distance spanned by the DArT markers encompassed the majority of the regions that could be described in terms of comparative genomic relationships with rice, Brachypodium distachyon, and Sorghum bicolor."
"23819624","abstracttext_conclusions","DArT markers are likely to be a useful common marker resource for ryegrasses and fescues, though the success in aligning different populations through the mapping of common markers will be influenced by degrees of population interrelatedness.

"23656640","abstracttext","The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effects of fibre source on intestinal mucosal barrier function in weaning piglets. A total of 125 piglets were randomly allotted on the basis of their body weight and litters to one of five experimental diets, i.e. a control diet without fibre source (CT), and diets in which expanded maize was replaced by 10% maize fibre (MF), 10% soyabean fibre (SF), 10% wheat bran fibre (WBF) or 10% pea fibre (PF). The diets and water were fed ad libitum for 30 d. Piglets on the WBF and PF diets had lower diarrhoea incidence compared with the MF- and SF-fed animals. A higher ratio of villous height:crypt depth in the ileum of WBF-fed piglets and higher colonic goblet cells in WBF- and PF-fed piglets were observed compared with CT-, MF- and SF-fed piglets. In the intestinal digesta, feeding WBF and PF resulted in increased Lactobacillus counts in the ileum and Bifidobacterium counts in the colon. Lower Escherichia coli counts occurred in the ileum and colon of WBF-fed piglets than in SF-fed piglets. Tight junction protein (zonula occludens 1; ZO-1) and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) gene mRNA levels were up-regulated in the ileum and colon of pigs fed WBF; however, feeding MF and SF raised IL-1α and TNF-α mRNA levels. Furthermore, higher diamine oxidase activities, transforming growth factor-α, trefoil factor family and MHC-II concentration occurred when feeding WBF and PF. In conclusion, the various fibre sources had different effects on the ileal and colonic barrier function. Clearly, WBF and PF improved the intestinal barrier function, probably mediated by changes in microbiota composition and concomitant changes in TLR2 gene expression."

Deep-sequencing a Hessian fly larval transcriptome led to the identification of 89 miRNA species that are either identical or very similar to known miRNAs from other insects, and 184 novel miRNAs that have not been reported from other species. A genome-wide search through a draft Hessian fly genome sequence identified a total of 611 putative miRNA-encoding genes based on sequence similarity and the existence of a stem-loop structure for miRNA precursors. Analysis of the 611 putative genes revealed a striking feature: the dramatic expansion of several miRNA gene families. The largest family contained 91 genes that encoded 20 different miRNAs. Microarray analyses revealed the expression of miRNA genes was strictly regulated during Hessian fly larval development and abundance of many miRNA genes were affected by host genotypes."
"23496979","abstracttext_conclusion","The identification of a large number of miRNAs for the first time from a gall midge provides a foundation for further studies of miRNA functions in gall midge biology and behavior. The dramatic expansion of identical or similar miRNAs provides a unique system to study functional relations among miRNA iso-genes as well as changes in sequence specificity due to small changes in miRNAs and in their mRNA targets. These results may also facilitate the identification of miRNA genes for potential pest control through transgenic approaches."

"23077788","abstracttext","Phytases catalyze the release of phosphate from phytic acid. In this study, a phytase producing bacterial strain Shigella sp. CD2 was isolated from the wheat rhizosphere. Phytase production started from the exponential phase of bacterial growth, showing the highest activity during the stationary phase. The enzyme activity was detected in both periplasmic and intracellular fractions. The enzyme was purified by about 133-fold with specific activity 780 U mg(-1) protein. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme was 5.5 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was thermostable and retained 100% and 75% of its activity on pre-incubation at 70 degrees and 80 degrees C for 30 min, respectively. The Km value for the substrate sodium phytate was 0.25 mM. The enzyme was highly specific to substrate phytate, and no activity was detected in presence of other phosphorylated substrates, such as ATP, ADP, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate and p-nirophenyl phosphate. The activity declined dramatically in presence of Cu2+, Zn2+ and Fe2+ and SDS, whereas Mg2+ and Co2+ slightly enhanced the enzyme activity. The addition of other metal ions or chemicals had little or no effect on phytase activity. The enzyme was resistant to both pepsin and trypsin. Due to high specific activity, substrate specificity, good pH profile, protease insensitivity and thermostability, phytase encoding gene from Shigella sp. CD2 could be an interesting candidate for industrial applications. Further studies on cloning and expression of Shigella phytase gene are currently in progress."

"24833511","abstracttext","Sunflower is an important oilseed crop, as well as a model system for evolutionary studies, but its 3.6 gigabase genome has proven difficult to assemble, in part because of the high repeat content of its genome. Here we report on the sequencing, assembly, and analyses of 96 randomly chosen BACs from sunflower to provide additional information on the repeat content of the sunflower genome, assess how repetitive elements in the sunflower genome are organized relative to genes, and compare the genomic distribution of these repeats to that found in other food crops and model species. We also examine the expression of transposable element-related transcripts in EST databases for sunflower to determine the representation of repeats in the transcriptome and to measure their transcriptional activity. Our data confirm previous reports in suggesting that the sunflower genome is >78% repetitive. Sunflower repeats share very little similarity to other plant repeats such as those of Arabidopsis, rice, maize and wheat; overall 28% of repeats are ""novel"" to sunflower. The repetitive sequences appear to be randomly distributed within the sequenced BACs. Assuming the 96 BACs are representative of the genome as a whole, then approximately 5.2% of the sunflower genome comprises non TE-related genic sequence, with an average gene density of 18kbp/gene. Expression levels of these transposable elements indicate tissue specificity and differential expression in vegetative and reproductive tissues, suggesting that expressed TEs might contribute to sunflower development. The assembled BACs will also be useful for assessing the quality of several different draft assemblies of the sunflower genome and for annotating the reference sequence."
"24852306","articletitle","Effect of a rye dwarfing gene on plant height, heading stage, and Fusarium head blight in triticale (×Triticosecale Wittmack)."
"24852306","abstracttext_key message","The rye-derived dwarfing gene Ddw1 on chromosome 5R acts in triticale in considerably reducing plant height, increasing FHB severity and delaying heading stage. Triticale, an amphiploid hybrid between durum wheat and rye, is an European cereal mainly grown in Germany, France, Poland, and Belarus for feeding purposes. Dwarfing genes might further improve the genetic potential of triticale concerning lodging resistance and yield. However, they might have pleiotropic effects on other, agronomically important traits including Fusarium head blight. Therefore, we analyzed a population of 199 doubled haploid (DH) lines of the cross HeTi117-06 × Pigmej for plant height, heading stage, and FHB severity across 2 locations and 2 years. The most prominent QTL was detected on chromosome 5R explaining 48, 77, and 71 % of genotypic variation for FHB severity, plant height, and heading stage, respectively. The frequency of recovery in cross validation was ≥90 % for all three traits. Because the markers that detect dwarfing gene Ddw1 in rye are also in our population the most closely linked markers, we assume that this major QTL resembles Ddw1. For FHB severity two, for plant height three, and for heading stage five additional QTL were detected. Caused by the considerable genetic variation for heading stage and FHB severity within the progeny with the dwarfing allele, short-strawed, early heading and FHB-resistant lines can be developed when population size is large enough."
"24855486","articletitle","A novel approach to the generation of seamless constructs for plant transformation."
"24855486","abstracttext_background","When creating plant transformation vectors, full control of nucleotides flanking the insert in the final construct may be desirable. Modern ligase-independent methods for DNA-recombination are based on linearization by classical type II restriction endonucleases (REs) alone or in combination with nicking enzymes leaving residual nucleotides behind in the final construct. We here explore the use of type IIS and type IIB REs for vector linearization that combined with sequence and ligase-independent cloning (SLIC) overcomes this problem and promotes seamless gene-insertion in vectors. Providing the basis for a collection of biolistic plant transformation vectors ready to be cloned with different genes-of-interest, we present two vectors, where promoter and terminator are joined by a spacer. During spacer-removal linearization (SRL), type IIS and type IIB REs remove their own recognition sequences from the vector leaving no undesired, short sequences behind."
"24855486","abstracttext_results","We designed two plant transformation vectors prepared for SRL in combination with SLIC, pAUrumII and pAUrumIII, harboring a spacer with recognition sites for a type IIS and IIB RE, respectively. The gene for a green fluorescent protein, gfp, was successfully cloned into both vectors; traces of pAUrumIII, however, contaminated the transformation due to incomplete linearization, an issue not encountered with the type IIS linearized pAUrumII. Both constructs, pAUrumII-gfp and pAUrumIII-gfp, were functional, when tested in vitro on wheat and barley endosperm cells for transient gfp expression."
"24855486","abstracttext_conclusions","All nucleotides flanking an insert in a biolistic plant transformation vector can be customized by means of SRL in combination with SLIC. Especially type IIS REs promote an efficient cloning result. Based on our findings, we believe that the SRL system can be useful in a series of plant transformation vectors, favoring the presence of functional sequences for optimal expression over redundant cloning-site remnants."
"24788721","articletitle","Gene expression profile and toxic effects in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to zearalenone."
"24788721","abstracttext","Zearalenone (ZEA), a mycoestrogen produced by Fusarium fungal species, is mainly found in cereal crops such as maize, wheat and barley. Although ZEA has been reported to be present in air, little is known about the health risk or the molecular basis of action when lung cells are exposed to ZEA. As ZEA has a similar structure to estrogen, its potential risk as an endocrine disrupting chemical (EDC) has thus aroused both environmental and public health concerns. The purpose of this study is to identify the responses and underlying molecular changes that occur when human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells are exposed to ZEA. Differential gene expression profiles were identified in cells that were treated with 40 µM ZEA for 6 h and 24 h by high-throughput microarray analysis using Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 GeneChip. The array results showed that after ZEA treatment, 262 genes at 6 h and 1073 genes at 24 h were involved in the differential regulation. Pathway analysis revealed that diverse cellular processes were affected when lung cells were exposed to ZEA resulting in impaired response to DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, down-regulation of inflammatory responses and alterations of epigenetic marks. Results of further experiments indicated that 40 µM ZEA decreased cell viability, induced apoptosis and promoted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in a time-dependent manner. Immuno-suppressive effects of ZEA were further revealed through the suppression of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and IL-1β). Interestingly, the level of global DNA methylation was markedly decreased after 24 h exposure to ZEA. Collectively, these observations suggested that a broad range of toxic effects are elicited by ZEA. Particularly, ROS may play a pivotal role in ZEA-induced cell death. These adverse effects observed in lung cells suggest that exposure to ZEA may increase susceptibility of lung cells to diseases and required further investigations."

"24722578","abstracttext","We previously characterized members of the Myb protein family, MYT1 and MYT2, in Fusarium graminearum. MYT1 and MYT2 are involved in female fertility and perithecium size, respectively. To expand knowledge of Myb proteins in F. graminearum, in this study, we characterized the functions of the MYT3 gene, which encodes a putative Myb-like transcription factor containing two Myb DNA-binding domains and is conserved in the subphylum Pezizomycotina of Ascomycota. MYT3 proteins were localized in nuclei during most developmental stages, suggesting the role of MYT3 as a transcriptional regulator. Deletion of MYT3 resulted in impairment of conidiation, germination, and vegetative growth compared to the wild type, whereas complementation of MYT3 restored the wild-type phenotype. Additionally, the Δmyt3 strain grew poorly on nitrogen-limited media; however, the mutant grew robustly on minimal media supplemented with ammonium. Moreover, expression level of nitrate reductase gene in the Δmyt3 strain was decreased in comparison to the wild type and complemented strain. On flowering wheat heads, the Δmyt3 strain exhibited reduced pathogenicity, which corresponded with significant reductions in trichothecene production and transcript levels of trichothecene biosynthetic genes. When the mutant was selfed, mated as a female, or mated as a male for sexual development, perithecia were not observed on the cultures, indicating that the Δmyt3 strain lost both male and female fertility. Taken together, these results demonstrate that MYT3 is required for pathogenesis and sexual development in F. graminearum, and will provide a robust foundation to establish the regulatory networks for all Myb-like proteins in F. graminearum."
"24631635","articletitle","Real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for group specific detection of important trichothecene producing Fusarium species in wheat."
"24631635","abstracttext","Trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivaneol (DON), nivalenol (NIV) and T2-Toxin are produced by a variety of Fusarium spp. on cereals in the field and may be ingested by consumption of commodities and products made thereof. The toxins inhibit eukaryotic protein biosynthesis and may thus impair human and animal health. Aimed at rapid and sensitive detection of the most important trichothecene producing Fusarium spp. in a single analysis, a real-time duplex loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was set up. Two sets of LAMP primers were designed independently to amplify a partial sequence of the tri6 gene in Fusarium (F.) graminearum and of the tri5 gene in Fusarium sporotrichioides, respectively. Each of the two sets detected a limited number of the established trichothecene producing Fusarium-species. However, combination of the two sets in one duplex assay enabled detection of F. graminearum, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium cerealis, F. sporotrichioides, Fusarium langsethiae and Fusarium poae in a group specific manner. No cross reactions were detected with purified DNA from 127 other fungal species or with cereal DNA. To demonstrate the usefulness of the assay, 100 wheat samples collected from all over the German state of Bavaria were analyzed for the trichothecene mycotoxin DON by HPLC and for the presence of trichothecene producers by the new real-time duplex LAMP assay in parallel analyses. The LAMP assay showed positive results for all samples with a DON concentration exceeding 163ppb. The major advantage of the duplex LAMP assay is that the presence of six of the major trichothecene producing Fusarium spp. can be detected in a rapid and user-friendly manner with only one single assay. To our knowledge this is the first report of the use of a multiplex LAMP assay for fungal organisms."

"24078158","abstracttext","The physiological, biochemical and molecular mechanisms regulating the initiation of a regenerative pathway remain partially unknown. Efforts to identify the biological features that confer transformation ability, or the tendency of some cells to induce transgene silencing, would help to improve plant genetic engineering. The objective of our study was to monitor the evolution of plant cell competencies in relation to both in vitro tissue culture regeneration and the genetic transformation properties. We used a simple wheat regeneration procedure as an experimental model for studying the regenerative capacity of plant cells and their receptivity to direct gene transfer over the successive steps of the regenerative pathway. Target gene profiling studies and biochemical assays were conducted to follow some of the mechanisms triggered during the somatic-to-embryogenic transition (i.e. dedifferentiation, cell division activation, redifferentiation) and affecting the accessibility of plant cells to receive and stably express the exogenous DNA introduced by bombardment. Our results seem to indicate that the control of cell-cycle (S-phase) and host defense strategies can be crucial determinants of genetic transformation efficiency. The results from studies conducted at macro-, micro- and molecular scales are then integrated into a holistic approach that addresses the question of tissue culture and transgenesis competencies more broadly. Through this multilevel analysis we try to establish functional links between both regenerative capacity and transformation receptiveness, and thereby to provide a more global and integrated vision of both processes, at the core of defense/adaptive mechanisms and survival, between undifferentiated cell proliferation and organization."

"24150094","abstracttext","The SOS signaling pathway has emerged as a key mechanism in preserving the homeostasis of Na⁺ and K⁺ under saline conditions. We have recently identified and functionally characterized, by complementation studies in yeast, the gene encoding the durum wheat plasma membrane Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter (TdSOS1). To extend these functional studies to the whole plant level, we complemented Arabidopsis sos1-1 mutant with wild-type TdSOS1 or with the hyperactive form TdSOS1∆972 and compared them to the Arabidopsis AtSOS1 protein. The Arabidopsis sos1-1 mutant is hypersensitive to both Na⁺ and Li⁺ ions. Compared with sos1-1 mutant transformed with the empty binary vector, seeds from TdSOS1 or TdSOS1∆972 transgenic plants had better germination under salt stress and more robust seedling growth in agar plates as well as in nutritive solution containing Na⁺ or Li⁺ salts. The root elongation of TdSOS1∆972 transgenic lines was higher than that of Arabidopsis sos1-1 mutant transformed with TdSOS1 or with the endogenous AtSOS1 gene. Under salt stress, TdSOS1∆972 transgenic lines showed greater water retention capacity and retained low Na⁺ and high K⁺ in their shoots and roots. Our data showed that the hyperactive form TdSOS1∆972 conferred a significant ionic stress tolerance to Arabidopsis plants and suggest that selection of hyperactive alleles of the SOS1 transport protein may pave the way for obtaining salt-tolerant crops."

"24162354","abstracttext","Diversity and relationships among ten tetraploid wheat landrace populations, collected from different localities in the central highlands of Ethiopia, were studied using isozyme markers and agronomic traits. This type of analysis in crop species is fundamental for designing optimal germ plasm collection, management practices and for developing an index for parental selection. The populations differed in allelic frequencies. Gene-diversity estimates showed that the populations encompass an appreciable amount of variation. However, differentiation between them was low, as was also confirmed by the presence of gene flow. Much of the diversity (85%), was attributable to the within-population level. The genetic distances were mostly small with the exception of those between a few pairs of populations. Thus, the relationships discerned among the populations were more of a similarity nature which could be ascribed to sharing a common ancestral population and/or adaptation to similar climatic conditions. The pattern of genetic divergence appeared to be independent of geographic distance. Considerable divergence in the agronomic traits was observed for certain populations. Cluster analyses of the isozyme and agronomic data produced different patterns and memberships of groupings. This lack of agreement could be ascribed to the different forces of evolution acting on isozyme markers and agronomic traits since agronomic traits, are the prime target of artificial selection. The clustering based on agronomic traits resulted in grouping together populations with similar agronomic performance. The results of this study suggest that taking more samples within a locality or population would be a better approach to capture the range of variation in the landrace populations of the central highlands of Ethiopia."

"24162574","abstracttext","A high consequence pathogen, High plains virus (HPV) causes considerable damage to wheat if the crop is infected during early stages of development. Methods for the early, accurate, and sensitive detection of HPV in plant tissues are needed for the management of disease outbreaks and reservoir hosts. In this study, the effectiveness of five methods-real-time SYBR green and TaqMan reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), endpoint RT-PCR, RT-helicase dependent amplification (RT-HDA) and the Razor Ex BioDetection System (Razor Ex)-for the broad-range detection of HPV variants was evaluated. Specific PCR primer sets and probes were designed to target the HPV nucleoprotein gene. Primer set HPV6F and HPV4R, which amplifies a product of 96 bp, was validated in silico against published sequences and in vitro against an inclusivity panel of infected plant samples and an exclusivity panel of near-neighbor viruses. The primers were modified by adding a customized 22 nucleotide long tail at the 5' terminus, raising the primers' melting temperature (Tm; ca. 10°C) to make them compatible with RT-HDA (required optimal Tm = 68°C), in which the use of primers lacking such tails gave no amplification. All of the methods allowed the detection of as little as 1 fg of either plasmid DNA carrying the target gene sequence or of infected plant samples. The described in vitro and in-field assays are accurate, rapid, sensitive, and useful for pathogen detection and disease diagnosis, microbial quantification, and certification and breeding programs, as well as for biosecurity and microbial forensics applications."

"24220779","abstracttext","Jasmonic-acid methylester promotes barley leaf senescence without changing the average synthesizing capacity for bulk leaf proteins in the treated tissues. This protein balance is the result of a massive formation of jasmonate-induced proteins (JIPs), which cannot be detected in controls (water-treated leaf segments). Jasmonate-induced proteins synthesized in vivo are virtually identical to the respective polypeptides translated in a wheat-germ system if programmed with the RNA of jasmonate-treated leaf segments. Both in-vivo-and in-vitro-formed JIPs correspond with molecular sizes of Mr 110, 66, 30, 23 and 10/12 kilodaltons. This observation indicates little if any post-translational modification. Specific mRNAs for JIPs and the JIPs labeled in vivo can be detected 3-5 h after jasmonate addition. Synthesis of JIPs increases up to 24 h whereas, at the same time, the translatable mRNAs for normal leaf proteins decrease drastically. This massive alteration of gene expression is reminiscent of heat-shock or other stress responses, but the proteins induced by jasmonate differ from those induced by elevated temperature with respect to molecular size, immunological relatedness, and kinetics of synthesis. It is suggested that JIP synthesis is rather a cause than a consequence of the common senescence symptoms and thus could represent some kind of early ""stress"" response in senescence induced by jasmonic-acid methylester. The action of jasmonic-acid methylester in gene expression points to a control at the transcript level."

"24500307","abstracttext_key message","Novel and previously known resistance loci for six phylogenetically diverse viruses were tightly clustered on chromosomes 2, 3, 6 and 10 in the multiply virus-resistant maize inbred line, Oh1VI. Virus diseases in maize can cause severe yield reductions that threaten crop production and food supplies in some regions of the world. Genetic resistance to different viruses has been characterized in maize populations in diverse environments using different screening techniques, and resistance loci have been mapped to all maize chromosomes. The maize inbred line, Oh1VI, is resistant to at least ten viruses, including viruses in five different families. To determine the genes and inheritance mechanisms responsible for the multiple virus resistance in this line, F1 hybrids, F2 progeny and a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross of Oh1VI and the virus-susceptible inbred line Oh28 were evaluated. Progeny were screened for their responses to Maize dwarf mosaic virus, Sugarcane mosaic virus, Wheat streak mosaic virus, Maize chlorotic dwarf virus, Maize fine streak virus, and Maize mosaic virus. Depending on the virus, dominant, recessive, or additive gene effects were responsible for the resistance observed in F1 plants. One to three gene models explained the observed segregation of resistance in the F2 generation for all six viruses. Composite interval mapping in the RIL population identified 17 resistance QTLs associated with the six viruses. Of these, 15 were clustered in specific regions of chr. 2, 3, 6, and 10. It is unknown whether these QTL clusters contain single or multiple virus resistance genes, but the coupling phase linkage of genes conferring resistance to multiple virus diseases in this population could facilitate breeding efforts to develop multi-virus resistant crops."

A total of 44 different HMW-glutenin patterns were identified, resulting from the combination of 15 alleles in the A genome and 19 in the B genome. Twenty-seven new allelic variants, 12 at theGlu-A1 locus and 15 at theGlu-B1 locus, were identified by comparing the mobilities of their subunits to those previously found in bread and durum wheats. The novel variants include six alleles at theGlu-A1 locus showing both x and y subunits. The genes coding for the 1Bx and 1By subunits showed no or very little (3%) inactivity, the 1Ax gene showed a moderate degree (6.3%) of inactivity whereas the gene coding for lAy showed the highest degree of inactivity (84.8%). A high level of polymorphism was also present for the omega- and gamma-gliadins and LMW-glutenin subunits encoded by genes at the linkedGli-B1 andGlu-B3 loci (19 alleles). Some Jordanian accessions were found to contain omega-gliadin 35, gamma-gliadin 45, and LMW-2 also present in cultivated durum wheats and related to good gluten viscoelasticity. The newly-discovered alleles enhance the genetic variability available for improving the technological quality of wheats. Additionally some of them may facilitate basic research on the relationship between industrial properties and the number and functionality of HMW- and LMW-glutenin subunits."

The deduced amino acid sequence shows strong homology to a γ-gliadin polypeptide from wheat and a γ-secalin polypeptide from rye and less homology to a B1 hordein polypeptide from barley. The 378 bp 5' non-coding region contains a TATA box at-85, an AGGA sequence at-105 and a-300 element typical of prolamin storage protein genes. The transcript start is 56 bp upstream of the ATG codon and 30 bp downstream of the TATA box. The 318 bp 3' non-coding region contains 2 putative polyadenylation signals, 76 and 132 bp downstream of the stop codon. γ-Hordein polypeptides are encoded by a small multigene family. The γ-hordein gene family is not part of the deleted chromosome 5 region, containing the Hor 2 locus, in the B hordein-deficient mutant hor 2ca. Two mRNA size classes of 1350 and 1450 nt are detectable in wild-type endosperms from 8 to 26 days after anthesis.

"24555434","abstracttext","The cardiovascular heat shock protein (cvHsp/HspB7) exhibited cardiac-specific expression and is a possible candidate of dilated cardiomyopathy in heart failure. The molecular characteristics and biochemical properties of cvHsp are only partially understood. This study was aimed to identify the biological properties and molecular high-order structure of cvHsp. The cvHsp protein was prepared by the refined purification at large amount. The pooled fractions were existed as two types of oligomers in solution and exhibited chaperone-like activity. The circular dichroism analyzed ureainduced unfolding processes. Multiple sequence alignment and an automated protein modeling were used to describe the three-dimensional structural model of the cvHsp monomer and dimer. By the refined purification, the cvHsp appeared in oligomeric and dimeric forms (approximately 17 kDa and 40 kDa, respectively) composed of 18.6-kDa monomers. The cvHsp prevented dithiothreitol (DTT)-induced aggregation of the insulin B chain and conferred oligomeric unfolding process in urea-containing solution. It exhibited structural stability and conformed to the two-state folding/unfolding oligomerization model. According to sequence alignment of the rat cvHsp gene, three-dimensional model based on the crystallographic structure of wheat Hsp16.9 was reconstructed. The cvHsp presented two antiparallel β-sheet sandwich structure of sHsp' core α-crystallin domain, and formed dimeric or oligomeric organization in solution. This work described the structural components of cvHsp and existed as the polydispersed molecular oligomers in vitro, which are some common properties of the sHsp family.

"24931760","abstracttext","The laggard (lag) mutant mouse, characterized by hypomyelination and cerebellar ataxia, is a spontaneously occurring mutant mouse caused by mutation in the Kif14 gene. In this mutant mouse, the laminated structures such as the cerebral and cerebellar cortices and the dentate gyrus are cytoarchitecturally abnormal. Macroscopically, the olfactory bulb of the lag mutant mouse is smaller in size and more transparent than the normal counterpart. Hematoxylin-eosin staining reveals that the mutant olfactory bulb has normal lamination in general, but detailed analysis has demonstrated that olfactory periglomerular cells and granule cells are reduced in number. In the mutant, olfactory glomeruli are cytoarchitecturally disorganized and mitral cells are arranged in multiple cell layers instead of being arranged in a single layer. The rostral migratory stream in the mutant becomes gradually thinner or obliterated during early postnatal days. Some of mitral cells and periglomerular cells are multinucleated, suggesting that Kif14 mutation leads to an abnormal cell division. In the mutant, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive cells in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricle are increased in number, especially at perinatal age, suggesting that the decreased population of granule cells in the lag mutant mouse is caused by the increased apoptotic cell death. The olfactory input appears to be intact, as indicated by anterograde labeling of olfactory nerves with an injection of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into the olfactory mucosa. In conclusion, the olfactory bulb of the lag mutant mouse is cytoarchitecturally affected, suggesting that the causal gene for lag mutation, i.e., Kif14, has multiple effects on the development of laminated structures in the central nervous system in addition to the myelin formation."

When employed in agriculture this type of resistance is often rapidly overcome by newly adapted pathogen races. The stacking of different resistance genes or alleles in F1 hybrids or in pyramided lines is a promising strategy for achieving more durable resistance. Here, we identify a molecular mechanism which can negatively interfere with the allele-pyramiding approach. We show that pairwise combinations of different alleles of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3 in F1 hybrids and stacked transgenic wheat lines can result in suppression of Pm3-based resistance. This effect is independent of the genetic background and solely dependent on the Pm3 alleles. Suppression occurs at the post-translational level, as levels of RNA and protein in the suppressed alleles are unaffected. Using a transient expression system in Nicotiana benthamiana, the LRR domain was identified as the domain conferring suppression. The results of this study suggest that the expression of closely related NB-LRR resistance genes or alleles in the same genotype can lead to dominant-negative interactions. These findings provide a molecular explanation for the frequently observed ineffectiveness of resistance genes introduced from the secondary gene pool into polyploid crop species and mark an important step in overcoming this limitation."

"26322057","abstracttext","The WRKY transcription factors have been reported to be involved in various plant physiological and biochemical processes. In this study, we successfully assembled 10 unigenes from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of wheat and designated them as TaWRKY44-TaWRKY53, respectively. Among these genes, a subgroup I gene, TaWRKY44, was found to be upregulated by treatments with PEG6000, NaCl, 4°C, abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2 and gibberellin (GA). The TaWRKY44-GFP fusion protein was localized to the nucleus of onion epidermal cells, and TaWRKY44 was able to bind to the core DNA sequences of TTGACC and TTAACC in yeast. The N-terminal of TaWRKY44 showed transcriptional activation activity. Expression of TaWRKY44 in tobacco plants conferred drought and salt tolerance and transgenic tobacco exhibited a higher survival rate, relative water content (RWC), soluble sugar, proline and superoxide dismutase (SOD) content, as well as higher activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), but less ion leakage (IL), lower contents of malondialdehyde (MDA), and H2O2. In addition, expression of TaWRKY44 also increased the seed germination rate in the transgenic lines under osmotic stress conditions while exhibiting a lower H2O2 content and higher SOD, CAT, and POD activities. Expression of TaWRKY44 upregulated the expression of some reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related genes and stress-responsive genes in tobacco under osmotic stresses. These data demonstrate that TaWRKY44 may act as a positive regulator in drought/salt/osmotic stress responses by either efficient ROS elimination through direct or indirect activation of the cellular antioxidant systems or activation of stress-associated gene expression."

"25935420","abstracttext_background","Drought is the major environmental stress threatening crop-plant productivity worldwide. Identification of new genes and metabolic pathways involved in plant adaptation to progressive drought stress at the reproductive stage is of great interest for agricultural research."
"25935420","abstracttext_results","We developed a novel Cross-Species meta-Analysis of progressive Drought stress at the reproductive stage (CSA:Drought) to identify key drought adaptive genes and mechanisms and to test their evolutionary conservation. Empirically defined filtering criteria were used to facilitate a robust integration of 17 deposited microarray experiments (148 arrays) of Arabidopsis, rice, wheat and barley. By prioritizing consistency over intensity, our approach was able to identify 225 differentially expressed genes shared across studies and taxa. Gene ontology enrichment and pathway analyses classified the shared genes into functional categories involved predominantly in metabolic processes (e.g. amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism), regulatory function (e.g. protein degradation and transcription) and response to stimulus. We further investigated drought related cis-acting elements in the shared gene promoters, and the evolutionary conservation of shared genes. The universal nature of the identified drought-adaptive genes was further validated in a fifth species, Brachypodium distachyon that was not included in the meta-analysis. qPCR analysis of 27, randomly selected, shared orthologs showed similar expression pattern as was found by the CSA:Drought.In accordance, morpho-physiological characterization of progressive drought stress, in B. distachyon, highlighted the key role of osmotic adjustment as evolutionary conserved drought-adaptive mechanism."
"25935420","abstracttext_conclusions","Our CSA:Drought strategy highlights major drought-adaptive genes and metabolic pathways that were only partially, if at all, reported in the original studies included in the meta-analysis. These genes include a group of unclassified genes that could be involved in novel drought adaptation mechanisms. The identified shared genes can provide a useful resource for subsequent research to better understand the mechanisms involved in drought adaptation across-species and can serve as a potential set of molecular biomarkers for progressive drought experiments."

"26256097","abstracttext","Taxonomic and functional profiling based on metagenome analyses frequently revealed that members of the class Clostridia dominate biogas reactor communities and perform different essential metabolic pathways in the biogas fermentation process. Clostridium bornimense strain M2/40(T) was recently isolated from a mesophilic two-phase lab-scale biogas reactor continuously fed with maize silage and wheat straw. The genome of the strain was completely sequenced and manually annotated to reconstruct its metabolic potential regarding carbohydrate active enzyme production and fermentation of organic compounds for consolidated biofuel production from biomass. The C. bornimense M2/40(T) genome consists of a chromosome (2,917,864bp in size) containing 2613 protein coding sequences, and a 699,161bp chromid (secondary replicon) harboring 680 coding sequences. Both replicons feature very similar GC-contents of approximately 29%. The complex genome comprises three prophage regions, two CRISPR-cas systems and a putative cellulosomal gene cluster that is located on the second replicon (chromid) of the strain. The overexpressed glycosyl hydrolases (GH) CelK (GH9) and CelA (GH48) encoded in the cellulosomal gene cluster were shown to be active on the substrates xylan and xyloglucan whereas XghA (GH74) is highly active on xyloglucan. Reconstruction of fermentation pathways from genome sequence data revealed that strain M2/40(T) encodes all enzymes for hydrogen, acetate, formate, lactate, butyrate, and ethanol production, leading to the classification of the isolate as acidogenic bacterium. Phylogenetic analyses uncovered that the closest characterized relative of C. bornimense is C. cellulovorans. Comparative analyses of the C. bornimense and C. cellulovorans genomes revealed considerable rearrangements within their chromosomes suggesting that both species evolved separately for a relatively long period of time and adapted to specific tasks within microbial consortia responsible for anaerobic digestion."

"25432546","abstracttext","Wheat genotype CSP44 carrying a recessive gene Lr48 exhibits adult plant resistance (APR; incompatible reaction) but gives a compatible reaction (susceptibility) at the seedling stage against leaf rust. A comparative gene expression analysis involving cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) and quantitative PCR (qPCR) was carried out for incompatible and compatible reactions in the genotype CSP44. cDNA-AFLP analysis was conducted using RNA samples that were isolated from flag leaves following inoculation with leaf rust race 77-5 (the most virulent race) and also after mock inoculation. As many as 298 of a total of 493 expressed transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) exhibited differential expression (262 upregulated and 36 downregulated). Of these 298 TDFs, 48 TDFs were eluted from gels, re-amplified, cloned, and sequenced. Forty two of these 48 TDFs had homology with known genes involved in the following biological processes: energy production, metabolism, transport, signaling, defense response, plant-pathogen interaction, transcriptional regulation, translation, and proteolysis. The functions of the remaining six TDFs could not be determined; apparently, these represented some novel genes. The qPCR analysis for 18 TDFs (with known and unknown functions, but showing major differences in expression) was conducted using RNA isolated from the seedlings as well as from the adult plants. The expression of at least 11 TDFs was induced and that of 4 other TDFs attenuated or remained near normal in adult plants following leaf rust inoculations. The remaining three TDFs had non-specific/developmental stage-specific expression. Functional annotation of TDFs that were upregulated suggest that the APR was supported by transient recruitment and reprogramming of processes like perception and recognition of pathogen effector by receptors, followed by CDPK and MAPK signaling, transport, metabolism, and energy release."

"25416762","abstracttext","The rhizosphere-colonizing bacterium Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84 is an effective biological control agent against take-all disease of wheat. In this study, we characterize a small-colony variant (SCV) isolated from a P. chlororaphis 30-84 biofilm. The SCV exhibited pleiotropic phenotypes, including small cell size, slow growth and motility, low levels of phenazine production, and increased biofilm formation and resistance to antimicrobials. To better understand the genetic alterations underlying these phenotypes, RNA and whole-genome sequencing analyses were conducted comparing an SCV to the wild-type strain. Of the genome's 5,971 genes, transcriptomic profiling indicated that 1,098 (18.4%) have undergone substantial reprograming of gene expression in the SCV. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed multiple alterations in the SCV, including mutations in yfiR (cyclic-di-GMP production), fusA (elongation factor), and cyoE (heme synthesis) and a 70-kb deletion. Genetic analysis revealed that the yfiR locus plays a major role in controlling SCV phenotypes, including colony size, growth, motility, and biofilm formation. Moreover, a point mutation in the fusA gene contributed to kanamycin resistance. Interestingly, the SCV can partially switch back to wild-type morphologies under specific conditions. Our data also support the idea that phenotypic switching in P. chlororaphis is not due to simple genetic reversions but may involve multiple secondary mutations. The emergence of these highly adherent and antibiotic-resistant SCVs within the biofilm might play key roles in P. chlororaphis natural persistence."

"26098705","abstracttext","There is much interest in quantifying the nutritional value of UK wheat distillers dried grains with solubles (W-DDGS) for livestock species. A study was designed to evaluate caecal parameters (pH, short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and bacterial diversity) in layer hens fed on balanced diets containing graded concentrations of W-DDGS. A total of 32 layer hens (Bovans Brown strain at 27 weeks of age) were randomly allocated to one of 4 dietary treatments containing W-DDGS at 0, 60, 120 or 180 g/kg. Each treatment was fed to 8 replicate individually housed layer hens over a 5-d acclimatisation period, followed by a 4-week trial. Individual feed intakes were monitored and all eggs were collected daily for weeks 2, 3 and 4 of the trial, weighed and an assessment of eggshell ""dirtiness"" made. All hens were culled on d 29 and caecal pH and SCFAs measured. Polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of the bacterial 16 S rDNA gene was used to assess total bacterial diversity of luminal caecal content from hens fed the 0 and 180 g W-DDGS/kg diets. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrograms were generated from DGGE banding patterns. Increasing W-DDGS dietary concentrations resulted in a more acidic caecal environment. Caecal SCFAs were unaffected by diet aside from a quadratic effect for molar proportions of isobutyric acid. Diversity profiles of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene from luminal caecal contents were unaffected by W-DDGS inclusion. The results of the current study suggest that W-DDGS can be successfully formulated into nutritionally balanced layer diets (supplemented with xylanase and phytase) at up to 180 g/kg with no detrimental effects to the caecal environment."

"25510357","abstracttext_key message","AtLRK10L1.2 produces a variety of alternatively spliced variants in the region a mini-exon and skipping of the mini-exon alters the subcellular localization of the protein. We have examined expression and alternative splicing in the gene encoding Arabidopsis LRK10-like 1 (AtLRK10L1) which is most closely related to wheat leaf rust 10 disease-resistance locus receptor-like protein kinase (LRK10). AtLRK10L1 produces two different transcripts, LRK10L1.1 and 1.2 through the use of two different promoters. We found no evidence of alternative splicing for the AtLRK10L1.1 transcript but identified numerous alternative splicing variants of AtLRK10L1.2 by sequencing of cloned cDNAs prepared from RNA isolated from whole cell, nucleolar and nucleoplasmic fractions. Many of these transcripts contained unspliced introns and accumulated differentially in the nucleolus and the nucleoplasm consistent with intron retention transcripts being retained in the nucleus (Göhring et al., Plant Cell 26:754-764, 2014). We examined the fate of different alternatively spliced transcripts by fusing variants to YFP and expressing them by agroinfiltration in Nicotiana benthamiana. AtLRK10L1 contains a 45 nt mini-exon which encodes part of a putative transmembrane domain. Full-length cDNA of LRK10L1.2 fused to YFP targeted the fusion protein to the plasma membrane while expression of transcripts where the mini-exon had been deleted, altered the localization of the fusion protein to the endoplasmic reticulum. Similarly, expression of full-length and mini-exon deleted versions of three other members of the LRK10 receptor-like kinase (RLK) gene family also showed the switch in localization. Thus, the mini-exons in Arabidopsis LRK10 genes are required for localization to the plasma membrane."

"25635822","abstracttext","Coeliac disease (CeD) is a highly heritable common autoimmune disease involving chronic small intestinal inflammation in response to dietary wheat. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region, and 40 newer regions identified by genome wide association studies (GWAS) and dense fine mapping, account for ∼40% of the disease heritability. We hypothesized that in pedigrees with multiple individuals with CeD rare [minor allele frequency (MAF) <0.5%] mutations of larger effect size (odds ratios of ∼2-5) might exist. We sequenced the exomes of 75 coeliac individuals of European ancestry from 55 multiply affected families. We selected interesting variants and genes for further follow up using a combination of: an assessment of shared variants between related subjects, a model-free linkage test, and gene burden tests for multiple, potentially causal, variants. We next performed highly multiplexed amplicon resequencing of all RefSeq exons from 24 candidate genes selected on the basis of the exome sequencing data in 2,248 unrelated coeliac cases and 2,230 controls. 1,335 variants with a 99.9% genotyping call rate were observed in 4,478 samples, of which 939 were present in coding regions of 24 genes (Ti/Tv 2.99). 91.7% of coding variants were rare (MAF <0.5%) and 60% were novel. Gene burden tests performed on rare functional variants identified no significant associations (p<1×10(-3)) in the resequenced candidate genes. Our strategy of sequencing multiply affected families with deep follow up of candidate genes has not identified any new CeD risk mutations."

"25979163","abstracttext","A major problem associated with the intensification of agriculture is the emergence of fungicide resistance. Azoles are ergosterol biosynthesis inhibitors that have been widely used in agriculture and medicine since the 1970s, leading to emergence of increasingly resistant fungal populations. The known genetic mechanisms underlying lower azole sensitivity include mutations affecting the CYP51 gene that encodes the target protein, but in many cases azole resistance is a more complex trait with an unknown genetic basis. We used quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping to identify genes affecting azole sensitivity in two crosses of Zymoseptoria tritici, the most damaging wheat pathogen in Europe. Restriction site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) was used to genotype 263 (cross 1) and 261 (cross 2) progeny at ∼ 8500 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and construct two dense linkage maps. Azole sensitivity was assessed using high-throughput digital image analysis of colonies growing on Petri dishes with or without the fungicide propiconazole. We identified three QTLs for azole sensitivity, including two that contained novel fungicide sensitivity genes. One of these two QTLs contained only 16 candidate genes, among which four most likely candidates were identified. The third QTL contained ERG6, encoding another protein involved in ergosterol biosynthesis. Known genes in QTLs affecting colony growth included CYP51 and PKS1, a gene affecting melanization in Z. tritici. PKS1 showed compelling evidence for pleiotropy, with a rare segregating allele that increased melanization while decreasing growth rate and propiconazole sensitivity. This study resolved the genetic architecture of an important agricultural trait and led to identification of novel genes that are likely to affect azole sensitivity in Z. tritici. It also provided insight into fitness costs associated with lowered azole sensitivity and suggests a novel fungicide mixture strategy."

"25913177","abstracttext","While modern agriculture relies on genetic homogeneity, diversifying practices associated with seed exchange and seed recycling may allow crops to adapt to their environment. This socio-genetic model is an original experimental evolution design referred to as on-farm dynamic management of crop diversity. Investigating such model can help in understanding how evolutionary mechanisms shape crop diversity submitted to diverse agro-environments. We studied a French farmer-led initiative where a mixture of four wheat landraces called 'Mélange de Touselles' (MDT) was created and circulated within a farmers' network. The 15 sampled MDT subpopulations were simultaneously submitted to diverse environments (e.g. altitude, rainfall) and diverse farmers' practices (e.g. field size, sowing and harvesting date). Twenty-one space-time samples of 80 individuals each were genotyped using 17 microsatellite markers and characterized for their heading date in a 'common-garden' experiment. Gene polymorphism was studied using four markers located in earliness genes. An original network-based approach was developed to depict the particular and complex genetic structure of the landraces composing the mixture. Rapid differentiation among populations within the mixture was detected, larger at the phenotypic and gene levels than at the neutral genetic level, indicating potential divergent selection. We identified two interacting selection processes: variation in the mixture component frequencies, and evolution of within-variety diversity, that shaped the standing variability available within the mixture. These results confirmed that diversifying practices and environments maintain genetic diversity and allow for crop evolution in the context of global change. Including concrete measurements of farmers' practices is critical to disentangle crop evolution processes."

"25808544","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum, the causal agent of Fusarium head blight, is a common pathogen on small grain cereals worldwide and produces various trichothecenes [deoxynivalenol (DON) is predominant] during infection. A previous study has revealed that DON production is positively correlated with the occurrence of carbendazim (MBC) resistance. Here, we identified and characterized two putative genes encoding hexokinase in F. graminearum (FgHXK1 and FgHXK2), which is a rate-limiting enzyme in DON biosynthesis. The expression level of hexokinase genes and the production of pyruvate, which is the precursor of DON, were up-regulated in the MBC-resistant strain, indicating that hexokinase genes might be involved in increased DON production. Phylogenetic and comparative analyses indicated that FgHXK1 was the predominant hexokinase gene. Gene disruption showed that ΔFgHXK1 severely affected DON production, indicating that FgHXK1 played a role in the regulation of DON biosynthesis. Morphological characterization showed that ΔFgHXK1 led to inhibited vegetative growth and conidiation. Sensitivity tests to MBC and various stresses indicated that both ΔFgHXK1 and ΔFgHXK2 mutants showed no significant difference from parental strains. Pathogencity assays showed that ΔFgHXK1 mutants lost virulence on wheat head and corn stigma; however, they showed no change in sexual reproduction. The FgHXK1-overexpressing transformants were obtained subsequently. Their pyruvate and DON production was confirmed to be increased, indicating that FgHXK1 positively regulated DON biosynthesis. Although additional defects appeared in overexpression mutants, MBC sensitivity showed no change. All of the results indicated that the transcriptional level of FgHXK1 regulated DON biosynthesis, but showed no direct relationship with MBC resistance."

"25737100","abstracttext","Alkaline pretreatment has the potential to enhance the anaerobic digestion of lignocellulosic biomass to biogas. However, the elevated pH of the substrate may require alkalitolerant microbial communities for an effective digestion. Three mixed anaerobic lignocellulolytic cultures were enriched from sediments from two soda lakes with wheat straw as substrate under alkaline (pH 9) mesophilic (37°C) and thermophilic (55°C) conditions. The gas production of the three cultures ceased after 4 to 5 weeks, and the produced gas was composed of carbon dioxide and methane. The main liquid intermediates were acetate and propionate. The physiological behavior of the cultures was stable even after several transfers. The enrichment process was also followed by molecular fingerprinting (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene and of the mcrA/mrtA functional gene for methanogens. The main shift in the microbial community composition occurred between the sediment samples and the first enrichment, whereas the structure was stable in the following transfers. The bacterial communities mainly consisted of Sphingobacteriales, Clostridiales and Spirochaeta, but differed at genus level. Methanothermobacter and Methanosarcina genera and the order Methanomicrobiales were predominant methanogenes in the obtained cultures. Additionally, single cellulolytic microorganisms were isolated from enrichment cultures and identified as members of the alkaliphilic or alkalitolerant genera. The results show that anaerobic alkaline habitats harbor diverse microbial communities, which can degrade lignocellulose effectively and are therefore a potential resource for improving anaerobic digestion."

"25768292","abstracttext","The production of biofuels from lignocellulosic biomass appears to be attractive and viable due to the abundance and availability of this biomass. The hydrolysis of this biomass, however, is challenging because of the complex lignocellulosic structure. The ability to produce hydrolytic cellulase enzymes in a cost-effective manner will certainly accelerate the process of making lignocellulosic ethanol production a commercial reality. These cellulases may need to be produced aerobically to generate large amounts of protein in a short time or anaerobically to produce biofuels from cellulose via consolidated bioprocessing. Therefore, it is important to identify a promoter that can constitutively drive the expression of cellulases under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions without the need for an inducer. Using lacZ as reporter gene, we analyzed the strength of the promoters of four genes, namely lacZ, gapA, ldhA and pflB, and found that the gapA promoter yielded the maximum expression of the β-galactosidase enzyme under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We further cloned the genes for two cellulolytic enzymes, β-1,4-endoglucanase and β-1,4-glucosidase, under the control of the gapA promoter, and we expressed these genes in Escherichia coli, which secreted the products into the extracellular medium. An ethanologenic E. colistrain transformed with the secretory β-glucosidase gene construct fermented cellobiose in both defined and complex medium. This recombinant strain also fermented wheat straw hydrolysate containing glucose, xylose and cellobiose into ethanol with an 85% efficiency of biotransformation. An ethanologenic strain that constitutively secretes a cellulolytic enzyme is a promising platform for producing lignocellulosic ethanol."

"26808423","abstracttext","In hexaploid crops, such as bread wheat, it should be possible to fine-tune phenotypic traits by identifying wild-type and null genes from each of the three genomes and combining them in a calculated manner. Here, we demonstrate this with gene combinations for two starch synthesis genes, SSIIa and GBSSI. Lines with inactive copies of both enzymes show a very dramatic change in phenotype, so to create intermediate phenotypes, we used marker-assisted selection to develop near-isogenic lines (NILs) carrying homozygous combinations of null alleles. For both genes, gene dosage effects follow the order B > D ≥ A; therefore, we completed detailed analysis of starch characteristics for NIL 3-3, which is null for the B-genome copy of the SSIIa and GBSSI genes, and NIL 5-5, which has null mutations in the B- and D-genome-encoded copies of both of these genes. The effects of the combinations on phenotypic traits followed the order expected on the basis of genotype, with NIL 5-5 showing the largest differences from the wild type, while NIL 3-3 characteristics were intermediate between NIL 5-5 and the wild type. Differences among genotypes were significant for many starch characteristics, including percent amylose, chain length distribution, gelatinization temperature, retrogradation, and pasting properties, and these differences appeared to translate into improvements in end-product quality, since bread made from type 5-5 flour showed a 3 day lag in staling."

"26678573","abstracttext","The maintenance of species integrity despite pervasive hybridization is ruled by the interplay between reproductive barriers. Endogenous postzygotic isolation will shape the patterns of introgression in hybrid zones, leading to variable outcomes depending on the genetic mechanism involved. Here, we analysed experimental and natural hybrid populations of Aegilops geniculata and Aegilops triuncialis to examine the genetics of species boundaries in the face of gene flow. Because long-terminal repeat retrotransposons (LTR-RTs) showing differential evolutionary trajectories are probably to affect hybrid dysgenesis and reproductive isolation between these wild wheat species, we addressed the impact of LTR-RTs in shaping introgression between them. Experimental settings involving artificial sympatry and enforced crossings quantified strong, but incomplete reproductive isolation, and highlighted asymmetrical endogenous postzygotic isolation between the two species. Natural hybrid zones located in the northern Golan Heights were analysed using plastid DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) marking random sequences, and sequence-specific amplified polymorphisms (SSAP) tracking insertions from six LTR-RT families. This analysis demonstrated asymmetrical introgression and genome reorganization. In comparison with random sequences and quiescent LTR-RTs, those LTR-RTs predicted to be activated following conflicting interactions in hybrids revealed differential introgression across the hybrid zones. As also reported for synthetic F1 hybrids, such LTR-RTs were specifically reorganized in the genomes of viable hybrids, confirming that conflicts between selfish LTR-RTs may represent key incompatibilities shaping species boundaries and fostering long-term species integrity in the face of gene flow."
"26635829","articletitle","Targeting Non-Coding RNAs in Plants with the CRISPR-Cas Technology is a Challenge yet Worth Accepting."
"26635829","abstracttext","Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have emerged as versatile master regulator of biological functions in recent years. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small endogenous ncRNAs of 18-24 nucleotides in length that originates from long self-complementary precursors. Besides their direct involvement in developmental processes, plant miRNAs play key roles in gene regulatory networks and varied biological processes. Alternatively, long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) are a large and diverse class of transcribed ncRNAs whose length exceed that of 200 nucleotides. Plant lncRNAs are transcribed by different RNA polymerases, showing diverse structural features. Plant lncRNAs also are important regulators of gene expression in diverse biological processes. There has been a breakthrough in the technology of genome editing, the CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regulatory interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9) technology, in the last decade. CRISPR loci are transcribed into ncRNA and eventually form a functional complex with Cas9 and further guide the complex to cleave complementary invading DNA. The CRISPR-Cas technology has been successfully applied in model plants such as Arabidopsis and tobacco and important crops like wheat, maize, and rice. However, all these studies are focused on protein coding genes. Information about targeting non-coding genes is scarce. Hitherto, the CRISPR-Cas technology has been exclusively used in vertebrate systems to engineer miRNA/lncRNAs, but it is still relatively unexplored in plants. While briefing miRNAs, lncRNAs and applications of the CRISPR-Cas technology in human and animals, this review essentially elaborates several strategies to overcome the challenges of applying the CRISPR-Cas technology in editing ncRNAs in plants and the future perspective of this field."

"26660352","abstracttext","Steady increase in global population poses several challenges to plant science research, including demand for increased crop productivity, grain yield, nutritional quality and improved tolerance to different environmental factors. Transgene-based approaches are promising to address these challenges by transferring potential candidate genes to host organisms through different strategies. Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer is one such strategy which is well known for enabling efficient gene transfer in both monocot and dicots. Due to its versatility, this technique underwent several advancements including development of improved in vitro plant regeneration system, co-cultivation and selection methods, and use of hyper-virulent strains of Agrobacterium tumefaciens harbouring super-binary vectors. The efficiency of this method has also been enhanced by the use of acetosyringone to induce the activity of vir genes, silver nitrate to reduce the Agrobacterium-induced necrosis and cysteine to avoid callus browning during co-cultivation. In the last two decades, extensive efforts have been invested towards achieving efficient Agrobacterium-mediated transformation in cereals. Though high-efficiency transformation systems have been developed for rice and maize, comparatively lesser progress has been reported in other graminaceous crops. In this context, the present review discusses the progress made in Agrobacterium-mediated transformation system in rice, maize, wheat, barley, sorghum, sugarcane, Brachypodium, millets, bioenergy and forage and turf grasses. In addition, it also provides an overview of the genes that have been recently transferred to these graminaceous crops using Agrobacterium, bottlenecks in this technique and future possibilities for crop improvement."

"27091460","abstracttext","Wild relatives, landraces and cultivars from different geographical regions have been demonstrated as the sources of genetic variation for resistance to rust diseases. This study involved assessment of diversity for resistance to three rust diseases among a set of Nordic spring wheat cultivars. These cultivars were tested at the seedling stage against several pathotypes of three rust pathogens in the greenhouse. All stage stem rust resistance genes Sr7b, Sr8a, Sr12, Sr15, Sr17, Sr23 and Sr30, and leaf rust resistance genes Lr1, Lr3a, Lr13, Lr14a, Lr16 and Lr20 were postulated either singly or in different combinations among these cultivars. A high proportion of cultivars were identified to carry linked rust resistance genes Sr15 and Lr20. Although 51 cultivars showed variation against Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) pathotypes used in this study, results were not clearly contrasting to enable postulation of stripe rust resistance genes in these genotypes. Stripe rust resistance gene Yr27 was postulated in four cultivars and Yr1 was present in cultivar Zebra. Cultivar Tjalve produced low stripe rust response against all Pst pathotypes indicating the presence either of a widely effective resistance gene or combination of genes with compensating pathogenic specificities. Several cultivars carried moderate to high level of APR to leaf rust and stripe rust. Seedling stem rust susceptible cultivar Aston exhibited moderately resistant to moderately susceptible response, whereas other cultivars belonging to this class were rated moderately susceptible or higher. Molecular markers linked with APR genes Yr48, Lr34/Yr18/Sr57, Lr68 and Sr2 detected the presence of these genes in some genotypes."

"27108336","abstracttext","Genetic factors controlling thousand-kernel weight (TKW) were characterized for their association with other seed traits, including kernel width, kernel length, ratio of kernel width to kernel length (KW/KL), kernel area, and spike number per m 2 (SN). For this purpose, a genetic map was established utilizing a doubled haploid population derived from a cross between German winter wheat cultivars Pamier and Format. Association studies in a diversity panel of elite cultivars supplemented genetic analysis of kernel traits. In both populations, genomic signatures of 13 candidate genes for TKW and kernel size were analyzed. Major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for TKW were identified on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 2D, and 4D, and their locations coincided with major QTL for kernel size traits, supporting the common belief that TKW is a function of other kernel traits. The QTL on chromosome 2A was associated with TKW candidate gene TaCwi-A1 and the QTL on chromosome 4D was associated with dwarfing gene Rht-D1. A minor QTL for TKW on chromosome 6B coincided with TaGW2-6B. The QTL for kernel dimensions that did not affect TKW were detected on eight chromosomes. A major QTL for KW/KL located at the distal tip of chromosome arm 5AS is being reported for the first time. TaSus1-7A and TaSAP-A1, closely linked to each other on chromosome 7A, could be related to a minor QTL for KW/KL. Genetic analysis of SN confirmed its negative correlation with TKW in this cross. In the diversity panel, TaSus1-7A was associated with TKW. Compared to the Pamier/Format bi-parental population where TaCwi-A1a was associated with higher TKW, the same allele reduced grain yield in the diversity panel, suggesting opposite effects of TaCwi-A1 on these two traits."

"27330562","abstracttext_background","Materials rich in lignocellulose, such as straw, are abundant, cheap and highly interesting for biogas production. However, the complex structure of lignocellulose is difficult for microbial cellulolytic enzymes to access, limiting degradation. The rate of degradation depends on the activity of members of the microbial community, but the knowledge of this community in the biogas process is rather limited. This study, therefore, investigated the degradation rate of cellulose and straw in batch cultivation test initiated with inoculums from four co-digestion biogas plants (CD) and six wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). The results were correlated to the bacterial community by 454-pyrosequencing targeting 16S rRNA gene and by T-RFLP analysis targeting genes of glycoside hydrolase families 5 (cel5) and 48 (cel48), combined with construction of clone libraries."
"27330562","abstracttext_results","UniFrac principal coordinate analysis of 16S rRNA gene amplicons revealed a clustering of WWTPs, while the CDs were more separated from each other. Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes dominated the community with a comparably higher abundance of the latter in the processes operating at high ammonia levels. Sequences obtained from the cel5 and cel 48 clone libraries were also mainly related to the phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes and here ammonia was a parameter with a strong impact on the cel5 community. The results from the batch cultivation showed similar degradation pattern for eight of the biogas plants, while two characterised by high ammonia level and low bacterial diversity, showed a clear lower degradation rate. Interestingly, two T-RFs from the cel5 community were positively correlated to high degradation rates of both straw and cellulose. One of the respective partial cel5 sequences shared 100 % identity to Clostridium cellulolyticum."

"27242724","abstracttext","Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) negatively impacts the dairy industry by decreasing dry matter intake, milk production, profitability, and increasing culling rate and death loss. Six ruminally cannulated, lactating Holstein cows were used in a replicated incomplete Latin square design to determine the effects of SARA induction on the ruminal microbiome and epithelium. Experimental periods were 10 days with days 1-3 for ad libitum intake of control diet, followed by 50% feed restriction on day 4, and ad libitum access on day 5 to the basal diet or the basal diet with an additional 10% of a 50:50 wheat/barley pellet. Based on subsequent ruminal pH, cows were grouped (SARA grouping; SG) as Non-SARA or SARA based on time <5.6 pH (0 and 3.4 h, respectively). Ruminal samples were collected on days 1 and 6 of each period prior to feeding and separated into liquid and solid fractions. Microbial DNA was extracted for bacterial analysis using 16S rRNA gene paired-end sequencing on the MiSeq Illumina platform and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Ruminal epithelium biopsies were taken on days 1 and 6 before feeding. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine gene expression in rumen epithelium. Bray-Curtis similarity indicated samples within the liquid fraction separated by day and coincided with an increased relative abundance of genera Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Streptococcus, and Lactobacillus on day 6 (P < 0.06). Although Firmicutes was the predominant phyla in the solid fraction, a SG × day interaction (P < 0.01) indicated a decrease on day 6 for SARA cows. In contrast, phylum Bacteroidetes increased on day 6 (P < 0.01) for SARA cows driven by greater genera Prevotella and YRC22 (P < 0.01). Streptococcus bovis and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens populations tended to increase on day 6 but were not affected by SG. In ruminal epithelium, CLDN1 and CLDN4 expression increased on day 6 (P < 0.03) 24 h after SARA induction and a tendency for a SG × day interaction (P < 0.10) was observed for CLDN4. Overall, results indicate more rapid adaptation to an induced bout of SARA in the solid fraction ruminal microbiome compared with ruminal epithelium."

"28855281","abstracttext","Stem rust was one of the most devastating diseases of barley in North America. Through the deployment of cultivars with the resistance gene Rpg1 , losses to stem rust have been minimal over the past 70 yr. However, there exist both domestic (QCCJB) and foreign (TTKSK aka isolate Ug99) pathotypes with virulence for this important gene. To identify new sources of stem rust resistance for barley, we evaluated the Wild Barley Diversity Collection (WBDC) (314 ecogeographically diverse accessions of Hordeum vulgare subsp. spontaneum ) for seedling resistance to four pathotypes (TTKSK, QCCJB, MCCFC, and HKHJC) of the wheat stem rust pathogen ( Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici , Pgt ) and one isolate (92-MN-90) of the rye stem rust pathogen ( P. graminis f. sp. secalis , Pgs ). Based on a coefficient of infection, the frequency of resistance in the WBDC was low ranging from 0.6% with HKHJC to 19.4% with 92-MN-90. None of the accessions was resistant to all five cultures of P. graminis A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was conducted to map stem rust resistance loci using 50,842 single-nucleotide polymorphic markers generated by genotype-by-sequencing and ordered using the new barley reference genome assembly. After proper accounting for genetic relatedness and structure among accessions, 45 quantitative trait loci were identified for resistance to P. graminis across all seven barley chromosomes. Three novel loci associated with resistance to TTKSK, QCCJB, MCCFC, and 92-MN-90 were identified on chromosomes 5H and 7H, and two novel loci associated with resistance to HKHJC were identified on chromosomes 1H and 3H. These novel alleles will enhance the diversity of resistance available for cultivated barley."

"28918485","abstracttext","In eukaryotic organisms, the 5-oxoprolinase is one of the six key enzymes in the γ-glutamyl cycle that is involved in the biosynthetic pathway of glutathione (GSH, an antioxidative tripeptide counteracting the oxidative stress). To date, little is known about the biological functions of the 5-oxoprolinase in filamentous phytopathogenic fungi. In this study, we investigated the 5-oxoprolinase in Fusarium graminearum for the first time. In F. graminearum, two paralogous genes (FgOXP1 and FgOXP2) were identified to encode the 5-oxoprolinase while only one homologous gene encoding the 5-oxoprolinase could be found in other filamentous phytopathogenic fungi or Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Deletion of FgOXP1 or FgOXP2 in F. graminearum led to significant defects in its virulence on wheat. This is likely caused by an observed decreased deoxynivalenol (DON, a mycotoxin) production in the gene deletion mutant strains as DON is one of the best characterized virulence factors of F. graminearum. The FgOXP2 deletion mutant strains were also defective in conidiation and sexual reproduction while the FgOXP1 deletion mutant strains were normal for those phenotypes. Double deletion of FgOXP1 and FgOXP2 led to more severe defects in conidiation, DON production and virulence on plants, suggesting that both FgOXP1 and FgOXP2 play a role in fungal development and plant colonization. Although transformation of MoOXP1into ΔFgoxp1 was able to complement ΔFgoxp1, transformation of MoOXP1 into ΔFgoxp2 failed to restore its defects in sexual development, DON production and pathogenicity. Taken together, these results suggest that FgOXP1 and FgOXP2 are likely to have been functionally diversified and play significant roles in fungal development and full virulence in F. graminearum."

"29183612","abstracttext","Resistance to 2,4-D (2,4-diclorophenoxyacetic acid) herbicide is increasing in various dicotyledonous weed species, including Papaver rhoeas, a weed infesting Southern European wheat crops. Non-target-site resistance to this herbicide is governed by a range of genes involved in herbicide stress response. To enable reliable measurement of gene expression levels in herbicide-resistant and susceptible plants it is necessary to normalize qPCR data using internal control genes with stable expression. In an attempt to find the best reference genes, the stability of seven candidate reference genes was assessed in plants resistant and susceptible to 2,4-D, subjected or not to herbicide stress. Using three statistical algorithms (geNorm, BestKeeper and NormFinder), the overall results revealed that glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, actin and ubiquitin were the most stable reference genes. The normalization expression levels of GH3 (indole-3-acetic acid amido synthetase) and GST3 (glutathione S-transferase) which are two genes up-regulated following 2,4-D treatment, were determined to verify the stability of these selected reference genes. A sudden increase in GH3 and GST3 expression was already detected 5h after herbicide application, confirming their involvement in plant response to 2,4-D. The validation results confirmed the applicability and accuracy of these reference genes. This study identified and validated reference genes in the non-model weed species P. rhoeas and these will facilitate gene expression analysis studies aimed at identifying functional genes associated with non-target-site resistance."

"28665481","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a causal agent of wheat scab disease and a producer of deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxins. Treatment with exogenous cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) increases its DON production. In this study, to better understand the role of the cAMP-protein kinase A (PKA) pathway in F. graminearum, we functionally characterized the PKR gene encoding the regulatory subunit of PKA. Mutants deleted of PKR were viable, but showed severe defects in growth, conidiation and plant infection. The pkr mutant produced compact colonies with shorter aerial hyphae with an increased number of nuclei in hyphal compartments. Mutant conidia were morphologically abnormal and appeared to undergo rapid autophagy-related cell death. The pkr mutant showed blocked perithecium development, but increased DON production. It had a disease index of less than unity and failed to spread to neighbouring spikelets. The mutant was unstable and spontaneous suppressors with a faster growth rate were often produced on older cultures. A total of 67 suppressor strains that grew faster than the original mutant were isolated. Three showed a similar growth rate and colony morphology to the wild-type, but were still defective in conidiation. Sequencing analysis with 18 candidate PKA-related genes in three representative suppressor strains identified mutations only in the CPK1 catalytic subunit gene. Further characterization showed that 10 of the other 64 suppressor strains also had mutations in CPK1. Overall, these results showed that PKR is important for the regulation of hyphal growth, reproduction, pathogenesis and DON production, and mutations in CPK1 are partially suppressive to the deletion of PKR in F. graminearum."

"27217575","abstracttext","Plant diversity in experimental systems often enhances ecosystem productivity, but the mechanisms causing this overyielding are only partly understood. Intercropping faba beans (Vicia faba L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) result in overyielding and also, enhanced nodulation by faba beans. By using permeable and impermeable root barriers in a 2-y field experiment, we show that root-root interactions between faba bean and maize significantly increase both nodulation and symbiotic N2 fixation in intercropped faba bean. Furthermore, root exudates from maize promote faba bean nodulation, whereas root exudates from wheat and barley do not. Thus, a decline of soil nitrate concentrations caused by intercropped cereals is not the sole mechanism for maize promoting faba bean nodulation. Intercropped maize also caused a twofold increase in exudation of flavonoids (signaling compounds for rhizobia) in the systems. Roots of faba bean treated with maize root exudates exhibited an immediate 11-fold increase in the expression of chalcone-flavanone isomerase (involved in flavonoid synthesis) gene together with a significantly increased expression of genes mediating nodulation and auxin response. After 35 d, faba beans treated with maize root exudate continued to show up-regulation of key nodulation genes, such as early nodulin 93 (ENOD93), and promoted nitrogen fixation. Our results reveal a mechanism for how intercropped maize promotes nitrogen fixation of faba bean, where maize root exudates promote flavonoid synthesis in faba bean, increase nodulation, and stimulate nitrogen fixation after enhanced gene expression. These results indicate facilitative root-root interactions and provide a mechanism for a positive relationship between species diversity and ecosystem productivity."
"27696587","articletitle","The genetic basis of local adaptation for pathogenic fungi in agricultural ecosystems."
"27696587","abstracttext","Local adaptation plays a key role in the evolutionary trajectory of host-pathogen interactions. However, the genetic architecture of local adaptation in host-pathogen systems is poorly understood. Fungal plant pathogens in agricultural ecosystems provide highly tractable models to quantify phenotypes and map traits to corresponding genomic loci. The outcome of crop-pathogen interactions is thought to be governed largely by gene-for-gene interactions. However, recent studies showed that virulence can be governed by quantitative trait loci and that many abiotic factors contribute to the outcome of the interaction. After introducing concepts of local adaptation and presenting examples from wild plant pathosystems, we focus this review on a major pathogen of wheat, Zymoseptoria tritici, to show how a multitude of traits can affect local adaptation. Zymoseptoria tritici adapted to different thermal environments across its distribution range, indicating that thermal adaptation may limit effective dispersal to different climates. The application of fungicides led to the rapid evolution of multiple, independent resistant populations. The degree of colony melanization showed strong pleiotropic effects with other traits, including trade-offs with colony growth rates and fungicide sensitivity. The success of the pathogen on its host can be assessed quantitatively by counting pathogen reproductive structures and measuring host damage based on necrotic lesions. Interestingly, these two traits can be weakly correlated and depend both on host and pathogen genotypes. Quantitative trait mapping studies showed that the genetic architecture of locally adapted traits varies from single loci with large effects to many loci with small individual effects. We discuss how local adaptation could hinder or accelerate the development of epidemics in agricultural ecosystems."

Despite the widespread occurrence of supernumerary chromosomes in fungi, their origin, relation to the core genome and the reason for their divergent characteristics are still largely unknown. The complexity of genome assembly due to the presence of repetitive DNA partially accounts for this."
"27552804","abstracttext_results","Here we use single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing to assemble the genome of a prominent fungal wheat pathogen, Fusarium poae, including at least one supernumerary chromosome. The core genome contains limited transposable elements (TEs) and no gene duplications, while the supernumerary genome holds up to 25 % TEs and multiple gene duplications. The core genome shows all hallmarks of repeat-induced point mutation (RIP), a defense mechanism against TEs, specific for fungi. The absence of RIP on the supernumerary genome accounts for the differences between the two (sub)genomes, and results in a functional crosstalk between them. The supernumerary genome is a reservoir for TEs that migrate to the core genome, and even large blocks of supernumerary sequence (>200 kb) have recently translocated to the core. Vice versa, the supernumerary genome acts as a refuge for genes that are duplicated from the core genome."

"27826966","abstracttext","Baker's asthma is the most prevalent occupational asthma, and IgE-mediated response is known as a major pathogenesis. However, recent studies have suggested the involvement of innate immune response because wheat flour contains bacterial endotoxins or lipopolysaccharides. To further understand a role of innate immune response in the development of work-related respiratory symptoms (WRS) in bakery workers, we investigated mannose-binding lectin (MBL), one of the initiating components of the complement cascade in a single cohort of bakery workers. A total of 373 bakery workers completed a questionnaire regarding WRS. The bakery workers were divided into 2 groups according to previous history of allergic rhinitis (AR)/bronchial asthma (BA): those with history of AR/BA (group I) and those without (group II). We measured serum MBL levels by using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay and genotyped 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms of the MBL2 gene (226G>A in exon 1, -554G>C, -431A>C, and -225G>C in the promoter) by using TaqMan assays. Fifty-nine subjects (15.5%) were previously diagnosed with AR/BA, and 64 subjects (16.8%) complained of WRS. No significant differences were found in serum MBL levels between groups I and II. However, in group II subjects, but not in group I subjects, the serum MBL levels were significantly higher in bakery workers with WRS than in those without. In addition, the serum MBL levels were significantly different according to genetic polymorphisms of the MBL2 gene and its haplotypes. In conclusion, serum MBL, affected by genetic polymorphisms, may be associated with WRS in bakery workers with no previous history of AR/BA."

SS has five distinct isoforms of which SSIII is involved in the formation of longer glucan chain length. Here we report identification and detailed characterization of 'true' orthologs of the well-characterized maize SSIII (ZmSSIII), among six monocots and two dicot species. ZmSSIII orthologs have nucleotide sequence similarity ranging from 56-81%. Variation in gene size among various orthologs ranged from 5.49 kb in Arabidopsis to 11.62 kb in Brachypodium and the variation was mainly due to intron size and indels present in the exons 1 and 3. Number of exons and introns were highly conserved among all orthologs however. While the intron number was conserved, intron phase showed variation at group, genera and species level except for intron 1 and 5. Several species, genera, and class specific cis-acting regulatory elements were identified in the promoter region. The predicted protein size of the SSIII orthologs ranged from 1094 amino acid (aa) in Arabidopsis to 1688 aa in Brachypodium with sequence identity ranging from 60%-89%. The N-terminal region of the protein was highly variable whereas the C-terminal region containing the Glycosyltransferase domain was conserved with >80% sequence similarity among the orthologs. In addition to confirming the known motifs, eleven novel motifs possibly providing species, genera and group specific functions, were identified in the three carbohydrate binding domains. Despite of significant sequence variation among orthologs, most of the motifs and their relative distances are highly conserved among the orthologs. The 3-D structure of catalytic region of SSIII orthologs superimposed with higher confidence confirming the presence of similar binding sites with five unidentified conserved regions in the catalytic (glycosyltransferase) domain including the pockets involved in catalysis and binding of ligands. Homeologs of wheat SSIII gene showed tissue and developmental stage specific expression pattern with the highest expression recorded in developing grains."

"29398839","abstracttext","Aegilops cylindrica , a salt-tolerant gene pool of wheat, is a useful plant model for understanding mechanism of salt tolerance. A salt-tolerant USL26 and a salt-sensitive K44 genotypes of A. cylindrica , originating from Uremia Salt Lake shores in Northwest Iran and a non-saline Kurdestan province in West Iran, respectively, were identified based on screening evaluation and used for this work. The objective of the current study was to investigate the expression patterns of four genes related to ion homeostasis in this species. Under treatment of 400 mM NaCl, USL26 showed significantly higher root and shoot dry matter levels and K + concentrations, together with lower Na + concentrations than K44 genotype. A. cylindrica HKT1;5 ( AecHKT1;5 ), SOS1 ( AecSOS1 ), NHX1 ( AecNHX1 ) and VP1 ( AecVP1 ) were partially sequenced to design each gene specific primer. Quantitative real-time PCR showed a differential expression pattern of these genes between the two genotypes and between the root and shoot tissues. Expressions of AecHKT1;5 and AecSOS1 was greater in the roots than in the shoots of USL26 while AecNHX1 and AecVP1 were equally expressed in both tissues of USL26 and K44. The higher transcripts of AecHKT1;5 in the roots versus the shoots could explain both the lower Na + in the shoots and the much lower Na + and higher K + concentrations in the roots/shoots of USL26 compared to K44. Therefore, the involvement of AecHKT1;5 in shoot-to-root handover of Na + in possible combination with the exclusion of excessive Na + from the root in the salt-tolerant genotype are suggested."

Six non-lactating Holstein cows with cannulas in the rumen and cecum were used in a 3 × 3 Latin square arrangement of treatments. During the first 3 wk of each experimental period, cows received a control diet containing 70% forages on a dry matter (DM) basis. In wk 4 of each period, cows received one of three diets: (1) the control diet; (2) a diet in which 34% of the dietary DM was replaced with pellets of ground wheat and barley (GBSC); or (3) a diet in which 37% of dietary DM was replaced with pellets of ground alfalfa (APSC). Rumen fluid, cecal digesta and feces were collected on d 5 of wk 4 of each period and the composition of the bacterial community was studied. Rumen fermentation responses were reported in a companion study. Both SARA-inducing challenges resulted in similar digesta pH depressions (as shown by the companion study), and reduced bacterial richness and diversity in rumen fluid, but GBSC had the larger effect. None of the challenges affected these measures in cecal digesta, and only GBSC reduced bacterial richness and diversity in feces. Only GBSC reduced the abundance of Bacteroidetes in rumen fluid. Abundances of limited number of bacterial genera identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing in the rumen, cecum and feces were affected by the GBSC. The APSC did not affect any of these abundances. Both challenges increased the abundances of several starch, pectin, xylan, dextrin, lactate, succinate, and sugar fermenting bacterial species in the rumen, cecum, and feces as determined by qPCR. Only GBSC increased that of Megasphaera elsdenii in the rumen. Both challenges decreased the abundance of Streptococcus bovis , and increased that of Escherichia coli , in cecal digesta and feces, with GBSC having the larger effect. These results showed that the SARA challenges caused moderate and reversible changes of the composition of the bacteria in the foregut and hindgut, with the greater changes observed during GBSC."

"28184248","abstracttext_results","We investigated the responses of A. niger to untreated, ionic liquid and hydrothermally pretreated wheat straw over a 5-day time course using RNA-seq and targeted proteomics. The ionic liquid pretreatment altered the cellulose crystallinity while retaining more of the hemicellulosic sugars than the hydrothermal pretreatment. Ionic liquid pretreatment of straw led to a dynamic induction and repression of genes, which was correlated with the higher levels of pentose sugars saccharified from the ionic liquid-pretreated straw. Hydrothermal pretreatment of straw led to reduced levels of transcripts of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes as well as the derived proteins and enzyme activities. Both pretreatments abolished the expression of a large set of genes encoding pectinolytic enzymes. These reduced levels could be explained by the removal of parts of the lignocellulose by the hydrothermal pretreatment. The time course also facilitated identification of temporally limited gene induction patterns."
"28184248","abstracttext_conclusions","The presented transcriptomic and biochemical datasets demonstrate that pretreatments caused modifications of the lignocellulose, to both specific structural features as well as the organisation of the overall lignocellulosic structure, that determined A. niger transcript levels. The experimental setup allowed reliable detection of substrate-specific gene expression patterns as well as hitherto non-expressed genes. Our data suggest beneficial effects of using untreated and IL-pretreated straw, but not HT-pretreated straw, as feedstock for CAZyme production."
"28142217","articletitle","The cyclase-associated protein FgCap1 has both protein kinase A-dependent and -independent functions during deoxynivalenol production and plant infection in Fusarium graminearum."
"28142217","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a causal agent of wheat scab and a producer of the trichothecene mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON). The expression of trichothecene biosynthesis (TRI) genes and DON production are mainly regulated by the cyclic adenosine monophosphate-protein kinase A (cAMP-PKA) pathway and two pathway-specific transcription factors (TRI6 and TRI10). Interestingly, deletion mutants of TRI6 show reduced expression of several components of cAMP signalling, including the FgCAP1 adenylate-binding protein gene that has not been functionally characterized in F. graminearum. In this study, we show that FgCap1 interacts with Fac1 adenylate cyclase and that deletion of FgCAP1 reduces the intracellular cAMP level and PKA activity. The Fgcap1 deletion mutant is defective in vegetative growth, conidiogenesis and plant infection. It also shows significantly reduced DON production and TRI gene expression, which can be suppressed by exogenous cAMP, indicating a PKA-dependent regulation of DON biosynthesis by FgCap1. The wild-type, but not tri6 mutant, shows increased levels of intracellular cAMP and FgCAP1 expression under DON-producing conditions. Furthermore, the promoter of FgCAP1 contains one putative Tri6-binding site that is important for its function during DON biosynthesis, but is dispensable for hyphal growth, conidiogenesis and pathogenesis. In addition, FgCap1 shows an actin-like localization to the cortical patches at the apical region of hyphal tips. Phosphorylation of FgCap1 at S353 was identified by phosphoproteomics analysis. The S353A mutation in FgCAP1 has no effect on its functions during vegetative growth, conidiation and DON production. However, expression of the FgCAP1 S353A allele fails to complement the defects of the Fgcap1 mutant in plant infection, indicating the importance of the phosphorylation of FgCap1 at S353 during pathogenesis. Taken together, our results suggest that FgCAP1 is involved in the regulation of DON production via cAMP signalling and subjected to a feedback regulation by TRI6, but the phosphorylation of FgCap1 at S353 is probably unrelated to the cAMP-PKA pathway because the S353A mutation only affects plant infection."
"28167368","articletitle","Identification and expression analysis of 11 subtilase genes during natural and induced senescence of barley plants."
"28167368","abstracttext","Subtilases are one of the largest groups of the serine protease family and are involved in many aspects of plant development including senescence. In wheat, previous reports demonstrate an active participation of two senescence-induced subtilases, denominated P1 and P2, in nitrogen remobilization during whole plant senescence. The aim of the present study was to examine the participation of subtilases in senescence-associated proteolysis of barley leaves while comparing different senescence types. With this purpose, subtilase enzymatic activity, immunodetection with a heterologous antiserum and gene expression of 11 subtilase sequences identified in barley databases by homology to P1 were analyzed in barley leaves undergoing dark-induced or natural senescence at the vegetative or reproductive growth phase. Results showed that subtilase specific activity as well as two inmunoreactive bands representing putative subtilases increased in barley leaves submitted to natural and dark-induced senescence. Gene expression analysis showed that two of the eleven subtilase genes analyzed, HvSBT3 and HvSBT6, were up-regulated in all the senescence conditions tested while HvSBT2 was expressed and up-regulated only during dark-induced senescence. On the other hand, HvSBT1, HvSBT4 and HvSBT7 were down-regulated during senescence and two other subtilase genes (HvSBT10 and HvSBT11) showed no significant changes. The remaining subtilase genes were not detected. Results demonstrate an active participation of subtilases in protein degradation during dark-induced and natural leaf senescence of barley plants both at the vegetative and reproductive stage, and, based on their expression profile, postulate HvSBT3 and HvSBT6 as key components of senescence-associated proteolysis."

"28232843","abstracttext","Leaf rust is one of the most common and damaging diseases of wheat, and is caused by an obligate biotrophic basidiomycete, Puccinia triticina ( Pt ). In the present study, 20 Pt isolates from Australia, comprising 10 phenotype-matched pairs with contrasting pathogenicity for Lr20 , were analyzed using whole genome sequencing. Compared to the reference genome of the American Pt isolate 1-1 BBBD Race 1, an average of 404,690 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per isolate was found and the proportion of heterozygous SNPs was above 87% in the majority of the isolates, demonstrating a high level of polymorphism and a high rate of heterozygosity. From the genome-wide SNPs, a phylogenetic tree was inferred, which consisted of a large clade of 15 isolates representing diverse presumed clonal lineages including 14 closely related isolates and the more diverged isolate 670028, and a small clade of five isolates characterized by lower heterozygosity level. Principle component analysis detected three distinct clusters, corresponding exactly to the two major subsets of the small clade and the large clade comprising all 15 isolates without further separation of isolate 670028. While genome-wide association analysis identified 302 genes harboring at least one SNP associated with Lr20 virulence ( p < 0.05), a Wilcoxon rank sum test revealed that 36 and 68 genes had significant ( p < 0.05) and marginally significant ( p < 0.1) differences in the counts of non-synonymous mutations between Lr20 avirulent and virulent groups, respectively. Twenty of these genes were predicted to have a signal peptide without a transmembrane segment, and hence identified as candidate effector genes corresponding to Lr20 . SNP analysis also implicated the potential involvement of epigenetics and small RNA in Pt pathogenicity. Future studies are thus warranted to investigate the biological functions of the candidate effectors as well as the gene regulation mechanisms at epigenetic and post-transcription levels. Our study is the first to integrate phenotype-genotype association with effector prediction in Pt genomes, an approach that may circumvent some of the technical difficulties in working with obligate rust fungi and accelerate avirulence gene identification."
"28727810","articletitle","Cucumber mosaic virus coat protein modulates the accumulation of 2b protein and antiviral silencing that causes symptom recovery in planta."
"28727810","abstracttext","Shoot apical meristems (SAM) are resistant to most plant viruses due to RNA silencing, which is restrained by viral suppressors of RNA silencing (VSRs) to facilitate transient viral invasion of the SAM. In many cases chronic symptoms and long-term virus recovery occur, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, we found that wild-type Cucumber mosaic virus (CMVWT) invaded the SAM transiently, but was subsequently eliminated from the meristems. Unexpectedly, a CMV mutant, designated CMVRA that harbors an alanine substitution in the N-terminal arginine-rich region of the coat protein (CP) persistently invaded the SAM and resulted in visible reductions in apical dominance. Notably, the CMVWT virus elicited more potent antiviral silencing than CMVRA in newly emerging leaves of infected plants. However, both viruses caused severe symptoms with minimal antiviral silencing effects in the Arabidopsis mutants lacking host RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6) or SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3), indicating that CMVWT induced host RDR6/SGS3-dependent antiviral silencing. We also showed that reduced accumulation of the 2b protein is elicited in the CMVWT infection and consequently rescues potent antiviral RNA silencing. Indeed, co-infiltration assays showed that the suppression of posttranscriptional gene silencing mediated by 2b is more severely compromised by co-expression of CPWT than by CPRA. We further demonstrated that CPWT had high RNA binding activity leading to translation inhibition in wheat germ systems, and CPWT was associated with SGS3 into punctate granules in vivo. Thus, we propose that the RNAs bound and protected by CPWT possibly serve as templates of RDR6/SGS3 complexes for siRNA amplification. Together, these findings suggest that the CMV CP acts as a central hub that modulates antiviral silencing and VSRs activity, and mediates viral self-attenuation and long-term symptom recovery."
"29079620","articletitle","Influence of cis Element Arrangement on Promoter Strength in Trichoderma reesei."
"29079620","abstracttext","Trichoderma reesei can produce up to 100 g/liter of extracellular proteins. The major and industrially relevant products are cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) and the hemicellulase XYNI. The genes encoding both enzymes are transcriptionally activated by the regulatory protein Xyr1. The first 850 nucleotides of the cbh1 promoter contain 14 Xyr1-binding sites (XBS), and 8 XBS are present in the xyn1 promoter. Some of these XBS are arranged in tandem and others as inverted repeats. One such cis element, an inverted repeat, plays a crucial role in the inducibility of the xyn1 promoter. We investigated the impact of the properties of such cis elements by shuffling them by insertion, exchange, deletion, and rearrangement of cis elements in both the cbh1 and xyn1 promoter. A promoter-reporter assay using the Aspergillus niger goxA gene allowed us to measure changes in the promoter strength and inducibility. Most strikingly, we found that an inverted repeat of XBS causes an important increase in cbh1 promoter strength and allows induction by xylan or wheat straw. Furthermore, evidence is provided that the distances of cis elements to the transcription start site have important influence on promoter activity. Our results suggest that the arrangement and distances of cis elements have large impacts on the strength of the cbh1 promoter, whereas the sheer number of XBS has only secondary importance. Ultimately, the biotechnologically important cbh1 promoter can be improved by cis element rearrangement. IMPORTANCE In the present study, we demonstrate that the arrangement of cis elements has a major impact on promoter strength and inducibility. We discovered an influence on promoter activity by the distances of cis elements to the transcription start site. Furthermore, we found that the configuration of cis elements has a greater effect on promoter strength than does the sheer number of transactivator binding sites present in the promoter. Altogether, the arrangement of cis elements is an important factor that should not be overlooked when enhancement of gene expression is desired."

"29729214","abstracttext","The optimization of plant architecture in order to breed high-yielding soya bean cultivars is a goal of researchers. Tall plants bearing many long branches are desired, but only modest success in reaching these goals has been achieved. MicroRNA156 (miR156)-SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) gene modules play pivotal roles in controlling shoot architecture and other traits in crops like rice and wheat. However, the effects of miR156-SPL modules on soya bean architecture and yield, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these effects, remain largely unknown. In this study, we achieved substantial improvements in soya bean architecture and yield by overexpressing GmmiR156b. Transgenic plants produced significantly increased numbers of long branches, nodes and pods, and they exhibited an increased 100-seed weight, resulting in a 46%-63% increase in yield per plant. Intriguingly, GmmiR156b overexpression had no significant impact on plant height in a growth room or under field conditions; however, it increased stem thickness significantly. Our data indicate that GmmiR156b modulates these traits mainly via the direct cleavage of SPL transcripts. Moreover, we found that GmSPL9d is expressed in the shoot apical meristem and axillary meristems (AMs) of soya bean, and that GmSPL9d may regulate axillary bud formation and branching by physically interacting with the homeobox gene WUSCHEL (WUS), a central regulator of AM formation. Together, our results identify GmmiR156b as a promising target for the improvement of soya bean plant architecture and yields, and they reveal a new and conserved regulatory cascade involving miR156-SPL-WUS that will help researchers decipher the genetic basis of plant architecture."

"29611040","abstracttext","The discovery and creation of biocatalysts for plant biomass conversion are essential for industrial demand and scientific research of the plant cell wall. α-1,2 and α-1,3-L-arabinofuranosidases are debranching enzymes that catalyzing hydrolytic release of α-L-arabinofuranosyl residues in plant cell wall. Gene database analyses shows that GH62 family only contains specific α-L-arabinofuranosidases that play an important role in the degradation and structure of the plant cell wall. At present, there are only 22 enzymes in this group has been characterized. In this study, we cloned a novel α-1,3-arabinofuranosidase gene (poabf62a) belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 62 from Penicillium oxalicum sp. 68 and expressed it in Pichia pastoris. The molecular mass of recombinant PoAbf62A was estimated to be 32.9 kDa. Using p-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside (pNPαAbf) as substrate, purified PoAbf62A exhibited an optimal pH of 4.5 and temperature of 35 °C. Results of methylation and 13 C NMR analyses showed that PoAbf62A was exclusively α-1,3-arabinofuranosidase, specific for cleavage of α-1,3-arabinofuranosyl residues, and with the absence of activity towards α-1,2-arabinofuranose and α-1,5-arabinofuranose. Therefore, PoAbf62A exhibits high activity on sugar beet arabinan and wheat arabinoxylan, because their branched side chain are decorated with α-1,3-arabinofuranose. On the other hand, there is a lack of activity with linear-α-L-1,5-arabinan and xylan that only contained α-L-1,5-arabinofuranose or β-1,4-xylose. The α-1,3-arabinofuranosidase activity identified here provides a new biocatalytic tool to degrade hemicellulose and analyze the structure of plant cell walls."

"29658841","abstracttext","Population genetic structure of the worldwide-distributed wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici has been extensively studied at large geographical scales, but to a much less extent at small or local spatial scales. A total of 627 single-conidial fungal isolates were sampled from several locations in northern France (Hauts-de-France Region) to assess fungal genetic structure at region, field, plant, and leaf layer scales, using highly polymorphic microsatellite markers and mating type idiomorphs. Important and overall similar levels of both gene and genotype diversities (gene diversity values of ≥0.44 and haplotype frequencies of ≥94%) were found at all the examined scales. Such rates of diversity are likely due to an active sexual recombination in the investigated areas, as revealed by equal proportions of the two mating types scored in all sampled populations. Interestingly, a rare occurrence of clones among lesions from a same leaf, as well as among leaves from different plant leaf layers (e.g., upper versus lower leaves), was highlighted, indicating that ascospores contribute much more than expected to Z. tritici epidemics, compared with pycnidiospores. Population structure and analyses of molecular variance revealed significant genetic differentiation at the regional scale (G ST = 0.23) and, as expected, not at the other more local scales (G ST ≤ 0.01). Further analyses using Bayesian and unweighted neighbor-joining statistical methods detected six genetic clusters within the regional population, overall distributed according to the locations from which the isolates were sampled. Neither clear directional relative migration linked to the geographical distribution of the locations, nor isolation by distance, were observed. Separate evolutionary trajectories caused by selection and adaptations to habitat heterogeneity could be the main forces shaping such structuration. This study provides new insights into the epidemiology and the genetic structure of Z. tritici at small local and, for the first time, at single plant and leaf layer scales. Such findings would be helpful in implementing effective control strategies."

"29904377","abstracttext","Fifteen antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and intI1 , a gene involved in horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ARGs, were quantified in three different soil samples from a 22 year old field experiment that had received inorganic fertilizer (NPK), organic manure (OM; a mixture of wheat straw, soybean oil cake and cotton cake), and control fields that had received no fertilizer and manure (CK). Tet (L) was the most abundant ARG in OM, which also contained considerable levels of intI1 . Molecular analysis of yearly collected archived soils over the past 22 years showed that tet (L) and intI1 were higher in OM soils than in NPK soils. The relative abundance of tet (L) was essentially constant during these years, while the level of intI1 in OM soils decreased over time. The main genotype of tet (L) was the same in archived and in fresh soil, OM, and irrigation water. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA genes of tetracycline-resistant bacteria (TRB) isolates indicated that the Firmucutes carrying tet (L) in OM were similar to those in the OM soil, suggesting that OM transferred TRB into the OM soils where they survived. Almost all of the TRB isolated from OM carried tet (L) and belonged to the Firmicutes . Survival of bacteria from the organic manure that carried tet (L) may be the cause of the increased level of tet (L) in OM soil."

"29946312","abstracttext","A total of 416 actinomycete cultures were isolated from various unique environments in Ethiopia and tested for bioactivity. Six isolates with pronounced antimicrobial activity were chosen for taxonomic identification and further investigation. Morphological and cultural properties of the isolates were found to be consistent with those of the genus Streptomyces , which was further confirmed by phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences. One of the isolates, designated Streptomyces sp. Go-475, which displayed potent activity against both pathogenic yeasts and Gram-positive bacteria, was chosen for further investigation. Metabolite profiles and bioactivity of Go-475 incubated on wheat bran-based solid and soya flour-based liquid media were compared using high-resolution LC-MS. This allowed identification of several known compounds, and suggested the ability of Go-475 to produce new secondary metabolites. Major anti-bacterial compounds were purified from liquid cultures of Go-475, and their structures elucidated by NMR and HRMS as 8-O-methyltetrangomycin and 8-O-methyltetrangulol. In addition, many potentially novel metabolites were detected, the majority of which were produced in solid media-based fermentation. The genome sequence of Streptomyces sp. Go-475 was obtained using a hybrid assembly approach of high quality Illumina short read and low quality Oxford Nanopore long read data. The complete linear chromosome of 8,570,609 bp, featuring a G+C content of 71.96%, contains 7,571 predicted coding sequences, 83 t(m)RNA genes, and six rrn operons. Analysis of the genome for secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene clusters further confirmed potential of this isolate to synthesize chemically diverse natural products, and allowed to connect certain clusters with experimentally confirmed molecules."

"29934111","abstracttext","Actinobacteria from special habitats are of interest due to their producing of bioactive compounds and diverse ecological functions. However, little is known of the diversity and functional traits of actinobacteria inhabiting coastal salt marsh soils. We assessed actinobacterial diversity from eight coastal salt marsh rhizosphere soils from Jiangsu Province, China, using culture-based and 16S rRNA gene high throughput sequencing (HTS) methods, in addition to evaluating their plant growth-promoting (PGP) traits of isolates. Actinobacterial sequences represented 2.8%-43.0% of rhizosphere bacterial communities, as determined by HTS technique. The actinobacteria community comprised 34 families and 79 genera. In addition, 196 actinobacterial isolates were obtained, of which 92 representative isolates were selected for further 16S rRNA gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The 92 strains comprised seven suborders, 12 families, and 20 genera that included several potential novel species. All representative strains were tested for their ability of producing indole acetic acid (IAA), siderophores, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminase (ACCD), hydrolytic enzymes, and phosphate solubilization. Based on the presence of multiple PGP traits, two strains, Streptomyces sp. KLBMP S0051 and Micromonospora sp. KLBMP S0019 were selected for inoculation of wheat seeds grown under salt stress. Both strains promoted seed germination, and KLBMP S0019 significantly enhanced seedling growth under NaCl stress. Our study demonstrates that coastal salt marsh rhizosphere soils harbor a diverse reservoir of actinobacteria that are potential resources for the discovery of novel species and functions. Moreover, several of the isolates identified here are good candidates as PGP bacteria that may contribute to plant adaptions to saline soils."

"31125059","abstracttext_background and aims","Improving drought adaptation is more pressing for crops such as sugarcane, rice, wheat and maize, given the high dependence of these crops on irrigation. One option for enhancing adaptation to water limitation in plants is by transgenic approaches. An increasing number of genes that are associated with mechanisms used by plants to cope with water scarcity have been discovered. Genes encoding proteins with unknown functions comprise a relevant fraction of the genes that are modulated by drought. We characterized a gene in response to environmental stresses to gain insight into the unknown fraction of the sugarcane genome. Scdr2 (Sugarcane drought-responsive 2) encodes a small protein and shares highly conserved sequences within monocots, dicots, algae and fungi."

"32188420","abstracttext_background","Polyploidy is widespread in animals and especially in plants. Different kinds of ploidies exist, for example, hexaploidy in wheat, octaploidy in strawberries, and diploidy, triploidy, tetraploidy, and pseudo-tetraploidy (partly tetraploid) in fish. Triploid offspring from diploid parents occur frequently in the wild in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and, as with triploidy in general, the triploid individuals are sterile. Induced triploidy in Atlantic salmon is common practice to produce sterile fish. In Norwegian aquaculture, production of sterile triploid fish is an attempt by government and industry to limit genetic introgression between wild and farmed fish. However, triploid fish may have traits and properties that differ from those of diploids. Investigating the genetics behind traits in triploids has proved challenging because genotype calling of genetic markers in triploids is not supported by standard software. Our aim was to develop a method that can be used for genotype calling of genetic markers in triploid individuals."

The quality of the called genotypes was sufficient to allow for assignment of diploid parents to the triploid offspring and to discriminate between maternal and paternal parents from autosomal inheritance patterns. In addition, as the maternal inheritance in triploid offspring is identical to gynogenetic inheritance, the maternal recombination pattern for each chromosome could be mapped by using a similar approach as that used in gene-centromere mapping."

The resulting genotypes can be used in parentage assignment of triploid offspring to diploid parents, to discriminate between maternal and paternal parents using autosomal inheritance patterns, and to map the maternal recombination pattern using an approach similar to gene-centromere mapping. Genotyping of triploid individuals is important both for selective breeding programs and unravelling the underlying genetics of phenotypes recorded in triploids.

"32133024","articletitle","BarleyNet: A Network-Based Functional Omics Analysis Server for Cultivated Barley, Hordeum vulgare L."
"32133024","abstracttext","Cultivated barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.) is one of the most produced cereal crops worldwide after maize, bread wheat, and rice. Barley is an important crop species not only as a food source, but also in plant genetics because it harbors numerous stress response alleles in its genome that can be exploited for crop engineering. However, the functional annotation of its genome is relatively poor compared with other major crops. Moreover, bioinformatics tools for system-wide analyses of omics data from barley are not yet available. We have thus developed BarleyNet, a co-functional network of 26,145 barley genes, along with a web server for network-based predictions (http://www.inetbio.org/barleynet). We demonstrated that BarleyNet's prediction of biological processes is more accurate than that of an existing barley gene network. We implemented three complementary network-based algorithms for prioritizing genes or functional concepts to study genetic components of complex traits such as environmental stress responses: (i) a pathway-centric search for candidate genes of pathways or complex traits; (ii) a gene-centric search to infer novel functional concepts for genes; and (iii) a context-centric search for novel genes associated with stress response. We demonstrated the usefulness of these network analysis tools in the study of stress response using proteomics and transcriptomics data from barley leaves and roots upon drought or heat stresses. These results suggest that BarleyNet will facilitate our understanding of the underlying genetic components of complex traits in barley."

"32240579","abstracttext","Diurnal variation in phloem sap composition has a strong influence on aphid performance. The sugar-rich phloem sap serves as the sole diet for aphids and a suite of physiological mechanisms and behaviors allow them to tolerate the high osmotic stress. Here, we tested the hypothesis that night-time feeding by aphids is a behavior that takes advantage of the low sugar diet in the night to compensate for osmotic stress incurred while feeding on high sugar diet during the day. Using the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique, we examined the effects of diurnal rhythm on feeding behaviors of bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi L.) on wheat. A strong diurnal rhythm in aphids as indicated by the presence of a cyclical pattern of expression in a core clock gene did not impact aphid feeding and similar feeding behaviors were observed during day and night. The major difference observed between day and night feeding was that aphids spent significantly longer time in phloem salivation during the night compared to the day. In contrast, aphid hydration was reduced at the end of the day-time feeding compared to end of the night-time feeding. Gene expression analysis of R. padi osmoregulatory genes indicated that sugar breakdown and water transport into the aphid gut was reduced at night. These data suggest that while diurnal variation occurs in phloem sap composition, aphids use night-time feeding to overcome the high osmotic stress incurred while feeding on sugar-rich phloem sap during the day."

"32331715","abstracttext","The CRISPR/Cas9 system has been successfully applied for gene editing in filamentous fungi. Previous studies reported that single stranded oligonucleotides can be used as repair templates to induce point mutations in some filamentous fungi belonging to genus Aspergillus. In Aspergillus niger, extensive research has been performed on regulation of plant biomass degradation, addressing transcription factors such as XlnR or GaaR, involved in (hemi-)cellulose and pectin utilization, respectively. Single nucleotide mutations leading to constitutively active forms of XlnR and GaaR have been previously reported. However, the mutations were performed by the introduction of versions obtained through site-directed or UV-mutagenesis into the genome. Here we report a more time- and cost-efficient approach to obtaining constitutively active versions by application of the CRISPR/Cas9 system to generate the desired mutation on-site in the A. niger genome. This was also achieved using only 60-mer single stranded oligonucleotides, shorter than the previously reported 90-mer strands. In this study, we show that CRISPR/Cas9 can also be used to efficiently change functional properties of the proteins encoded by the target gene by on-site genomic mutations in A. niger. The obtained strains with constitutively active XlnR and GaaR versions resulted in increased production of plant biomass degrading enzymes and improved release of d-xylose and l-arabinose from wheat bran, and d-galacturonic acid from sugar beet pulp."

"32280660","abstracttext","Background: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune and inflammatory disease that affects the joints and consequently leads to the destruction of cartilage and bone lesions. Traditionally, ginger has been consumed in treatment of osteoarthritis, joint and muscle pain, neurological diseases, and inflammation of gums, tooth pain, asthma, stroke, diabetes, and constipation. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of ginger on some immunological and inflammatory markers in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: In this study, which was performed during 2013-2016, 66 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis who referred to the rheumatology clinic at Shariati hospital were en-rolled. Patients were randomly divided into 2 groups: one group consumed 1.5 gr ginger per day, and the other group took roasted wheat flour (placebo), respectively. To determine the effect of confounding factors on the findings of the study, questionnaires for nutrient intake, physical activity, and medication were filled, and BMI was measured. For each participant, at the beginning and end of the study, Serum hs-CRP and mRNA levels of IL-1β, IL-2 and TNF-α were determined by ELISA and Quantitative Real Time PCR, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software. Significance level was set at p<0.05. Results: Results of the study showed ginger powder supplementation caused a significant decline in CRP (p=0.050) and IL-1β mRNA level (p=0.021). TNFα mRNA levels reduced in ginger group compared to placebo groupalthough the difference was not significant between the 2 groups (p=0.093). Ginger had no effects on IL2 gene expression. Conclusion: This study showed that ginger reduces inflammatory factors hs-CRP and IL-1β gene expression in patients with active RA and it seems that ginger can improve the inflam-mation in the patients."

Two cultivars, LJ196 (drought-tolerant) and XD18 (drought-prone), were pot-grown under well-watered (WW) and drought-stressed (DS) conditions. Concentrations of WSC components and ABA, and fructan metabolizing enzymes and genes were investigated in peduncle after anthesis. When compared with those under the WW, LJ196 remained higher grain yield and grain-filling rate than XD18 under the DS. During the early period of grain filling (0-14 DAA), DS increased concentrations of total WSC and its components, but thereafter substantially reduced them. The gene expression levels and enzymatic activities of fructan 1-exohydrolases (1-FEH) and fructan 6-exohydrolases (6-FEH) showed similar trends, whereas those of fructan: fructan 1-fructosyltransferase (1-FFT), and sucrose: fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) were depressed and declined over the period of examination. LJ196 still showed higher levels of ABA and fructan metabolizing. The ABA concentration under the DS was positively and significantly correlated with total WSC and fructan concentration, and expression levels of these enzymes and genes as well, with more prominently with those of 6-FEH. Presumably, ABA could enhance fructan hydrolysis by strongly up-regulating the gene expression and enzymatic activity of 6-FEH to accelerate WSC remobilization. However, stem WSC induced by DS could be not fully remobilized to grains, due to its weaker correlation with grain-filling rate and finally indicating lower grain yield. The findings would provide useful information for wheat production under water-deficit environments."

"32685984","abstracttext_key message","Two major QTL for tiller angle were identified on chromosomes 1AL and 5DL, and TaTAC-D1 might be the candidate gene for QTA.caas-5DL. An ideal plant architecture is important for achieving high grain yield in crops. Tiller angle (TA) is an important factor influencing yield. In the present study, 266 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Zhongmai 871 (ZM871) and its sister line Zhongmai 895 (ZM895) was used to map TA by extreme pool-genotyping and inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM). Two quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 1AL and 5DL were identified with reduced tiller angle alleles contributed by ZM895. QTA.caas-1AL was detected in six environments, explaining 5.4-11.2% of the phenotypic variances. The major stable QTL, QTA.caas-5DL, was identified in all eight environments, accounting for 13.8-24.8% of the phenotypic variances. The two QTL were further validated using BC 1 F 4 populations derived from backcrosses ZM871/ZM895//ZM871 (121 lines) and ZM871/ZM895//ZM895 (175 lines). Gene TraesCS5D02G322600, located in the 5DL QTL and designated TaTAC-D1, had a SNP in the third exon with 'A' and 'G' in ZM871 and ZM895, respectively, resulting in a Thr169Ala amino acid change. A KASP marker based on this SNP was validated in two sets of germplasm, providing further evidence for the significant effects of TaTAC-D1 on TA. Thus extreme pool-genotyping can be employed to detect QTL for plant architecture traits and KASP markers tightly linked with the QTL can be used in wheat breeding programs targeting improved plant architecture."

"32528490","abstracttext","Agaves resist extreme heat and drought. In A. tequilana var. azul , the central spike of the rosette -containing the shoot apical meristem and folded leaves in early stages of development- is remarkably heat tolerant. We found that the most abundant protein in this organ is a 27 kDa protein. This protein was named mayahuelin to honor Mayáhuel, the agave goddess in the Aztec pantheon. LC-MS/MS analyses identified mayahuelin as a type I RIP ( R ibosome I nactivating P rotein). In addition to the spike, mayahuelin was expressed in the peduncle and in seeds, whereas in mature leaves, anthers, filaments, pistils, and tepals was absent. Anti-mayahuelin antibody raised against the A. tequilana var. azul protein revealed strong signals in spike leaves of A. angustifolia , A. bracteosa , A. rhodacantha , and A. vilmoriniana , and moderate signals in A. isthmensis , A. kerchovei , A. striata ssp. falcata , and A. titanota , indicating conservation at the protein level throughout the Agave genus. As in charybdin, a type I RIP characterized in Drimia maritima , mayahuelin from A. tequilana var. azul contains a natural aa substitution (Y76D) in one out of four aa comprising the active site. The RIP gene family in A. tequilana var. azul consists of at least 12 genes and Mayahuelin is the only member encoding active site substitutions. Unlike canonical plant RIPs, expression of Mayahuelin gene in S. cerevisiae did not compromise growth. The inhibitory activity of the purified protein on a wheat germ in vitro translation system was moderate. Mayahuelin orthologs from other Agave species displayed one of six alleles at Y76: (Y/Y, D/D, S/S, Y/D, Y/S, D/S) and proved to be useful markers for phylogenetic analysis. Homozygous alleles were more frequent in wild accessions whereas heterozygous alleles were more frequent in cultivars. Mayahuelin sequences from different wild populations of A. angustifolia and A. rhodacanth a allowed the identification of accessions closely related to azul, manso, sigüín, mano larga, and bermejo varieties of A. tequilana and var. espadín of A. angustifolia . Four A. rhodacantha accessions and A. angustifolia var. espadín were closer relatives of A. tequilana var. azul than A. angustifolia wild accessions or other A. tequilana varieties."

"32442184","abstracttext","Recently-emerged base editing technologies could create single base mutations at precise genomic positions without generation DNA double strand breaks. Herbicide resistant mutations have been successfully introduced to different plant species, including Arabidopsis, watermelon, wheat, potato and tomato via C to T (or G to A on the complementary strand) base editors (CBE) at the P197 position of endogenous acetolactate synthase (ALS) genes. Additionally, G to A conversion to another conserved amino acid S653 on ALS gene could confer tolerance to imidazolinone herbicides. However, no such mutation was successfully generated via CBE, likely due to the target C base is outside of the classic base editing window. Since CBE driven by egg cell (EC) specific promoter would re-edit the wild type alleles in egg cells and early embryos, we hypothesized the diversity of base editing outcomes could be largely increased at later generations to allow selection of desired herbicide resistant mutants. To test this hypothesis, we aimed to introduce C to T conversion to the complement strand of S653 codon at ALS gene, hosting a C at the 10th position within the 20-nt spacer sequence outside of the classic base editing window. While we did not detect base-edited T1 plants, efficient and diverse base edits emerged at later generations. Herbicide resistant mutants with different editing outcomes were recovered when T3 and T4 seeds were subject to herbicide selection. As expected, most herbicide resistant plants contained S653N mutation as a result of G10 to A10. Our results showed that CBE could create imidazolinone herbicide resistant trait in Arabidopsis and be potentially applied to crops to facilitate weed control."

"30107611","abstracttext","Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is very harmful for broiler production and public health. The water-soluble castoff in gluten production, i.e., the water-soluble substances of wheat (WSW) that contains 14% pentosan has positive effect on animal nutrient absorption, immunity, and antioxidation. Our study aims to investigate the preventive effects of WSW against AFB1-induced broiler liver injury. One day-old Arbor Acres broilers were randomly separated to 4 groups and were, respectively, fed with control diet, diet with 5 mg/kg AFB1 standard, diet with 5 mg/kg AFB1 standard and 214 ml/kg WSW, and diet with 214 ml/kg WSW continuously for 28 d. The histopathological, ultra-structural, and serological changes were tested to evaluate liver damage. The hallmarks of hepatocellular autophagy, apoptosis, and inflammation were measured by Western Blot and real-time polymerase chain reaction. The content of AFB1 in chicken liver was detected with an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography linked with the fluorescence detection method. The results showed that (i) WSW restored AFB1-induced changes in serum biochemical parameters, and ameliorated histomorphological changes in hepatocytes, (ii) WSW reduced the content of AFB1 in chicken liver, (iii) WSW alleviated AFB1-induced autophagy inhibition by up-regulating hepatic LC3, beclin-1, and down-regulating hepatic mTOR and cytoplasmic P53 expressions, (iv) WSW alleviated AFB1-induced hepatocellular apoptosis via inhibiting pro-apoptotic gene expression (nuclear P53, Caspase3, Bax), and promoting anti-apoptotic gene expression (bcl-2), (v) WSW feeding ameliorated AFB1-induced liver inflammation via impeding TLR4/NF-${{\bf \kappa }}$B and IL-1/NF-${{\bf \kappa }}$B signaling pathways, down-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1${{\bf \beta }}$, IL-6, and IL-8), and markedly up-regulating anti-inflammatory genes (IL-10 and HO-1). Conclusively, WSW is a potential preventer of AFB1-induced broiler liver damage by reducing the AFB1 content in liver, accelerating hepatocellular autophagy and inhibiting hepatocytes apoptosis and liver inflammation."

"30124970","abstracttext","This study investigated the hypothesis that dietary supplementation of lignocellulose in broilers influences the gut bacterial population and bacterial fermentation, has anti-inflammatory effects, and increases mucin synthesis in the intestine, and, through these changes, influences broiler performance positively. Day-old male Cobb 500 broilers (n = 96) were allotted to 3 experimental groups and fed 3 different maize-wheat-soybean meal-based basal diets during days 1 to 10, 11 to 21, and 22 to 35. The basal diets were fed to the control group, and were supplemented with 0.8% of a standard lignocellulose (LCS) or a fermentable lignocellulose (LCF). Body weight and feed consumption were determined, and at slaughter (day 35), carcass and gizzard weights and gizzard content pH were recorded, and samples of jejunum, cecum, and colon mucosa and of cecum digesta were collected from 15 birds/group. Growth performance and feed intake were not influenced, but dressing percentage was higher in group LCF compared to the other groups. In group LCS and the control group, performance, gizzard weight and gizzard content pH, intestinal gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and of the mucins 2, 5ac and 13, the cecal short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) profile, and bacterial diversity were similar, and relative abundance of bacterial groups (16S DNA sequencing) differed. Supplementation of LCF decreased the expression of the pro-inflammatory genes encoding interleukins 1ß and 17 (P < 0.05) and those of 2 and 8 (P < 0.10) in the jejunum only. The bacterial population differed, and the SCFA profile shifted toward acetate at the expense of butyrate in group LCF compared to the control group. For example, the abundance of Firmicutes and of Ruminococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae decreased, whereas those of Peptostreptococcaceae, Erysipelotrichaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae and that of members of the phylum Proteobacteria increased in group LCF compared to the control group. These data indicate that the susceptibility of lignocellulose to fermentation is crucial for mediating its effects on intestinal gene expression and the bacterial population in the cecum, which may also affect dressing percentage."

"30115100","abstracttext_background","Transposable elements (TEs) are major components of large plant genomes and main drivers of genome evolution. The most recent assembly of hexaploid bread wheat recovered the highly repetitive TE space in an almost complete chromosomal context and enabled a detailed view into the dynamics of TEs in the A, B, and D subgenomes."
"30115100","abstracttext_results","The overall TE content is very similar between the A, B, and D subgenomes, although we find no evidence for bursts of TE amplification after the polyploidization events. Despite the near-complete turnover of TEs since the subgenome lineages diverged from a common ancestor, 76% of TE families are still present in similar proportions in each subgenome. Moreover, spacing between syntenic genes is also conserved, even though syntenic TEs have been replaced by new insertions over time, suggesting that distances between genes, but not sequences, are under evolutionary constraints. The TE composition of the immediate gene vicinity differs from the core intergenic regions. We find the same TE families to be enriched or depleted near genes in all three subgenomes. Evaluations at the subfamily level of timed long terminal repeat-retrotransposon insertions highlight the independent evolution of the diploid A, B, and D lineages before polyploidization and cases of concerted proliferation in the AB tetraploid."

Moreover, key morphological and chemotaxonomic properties also confirmed the affiliation of strain SJ-25 T to the genus Glycomyces. The cell wall contained meso-diaminopimelic acid and the whole-cell hydrolysates contained galactose, glucose and xylose. The phospholipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol mannoside, glycolipid and two unidentified polar lipids. The menaquinones were MK-11, MK-10(H4) and MK-10(H2). Major fatty acids were iso-C16 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0, iso-C15 : 0, anteiso-C17 : 0 and iso-C14 : 0. The DNA G+C content was 72.2 mol%. The combination of DNA-DNA hybridization results and some phenotypic characteristics demonstrated that strain SJ-25 T could be distinguished from its closely related strains. Therefore, it is proposed that strain SJ-25 T represents a novel species of the genus Glycomyces, for which the name Glycomycesdulcitolivorans sp. nov. is proposed.

Categorized into nine subfamilies, its members are important to most organisms including fungi, where they play varied roles in fundamental cellular processes, plant pathogenesis or fungicide tolerance. However, these proteins are not yet well-understood in the class Dothideomycetes, which includes several phytopathogens that infect a wide range of food crops including wheat, barley and maize and cause major economic losses."

These proteins were classified into subfamilies A to I, which revealed the distribution of the subfamily members across the Dothideomycetes and Ascomycetes genomes. Phylogenetic analysis of Dothideomycetes ABC proteins indicated evolutionary relationships among the subfamilies within this class. Further, phylogenetic relationships among the ABC proteins from the Model and the Test fungi within each subfamily were analyzed, which aided in classifying these proteins into subgroups.

"30542294","abstracttext","Aphidius gifuensis Ashmead is a dominant endoparasitoid of aphids, such as Myzus persicae and Sitobion avenae , and plays an important role in controlling aphids in various habitats, including tobacco plants and wheat in China. A. gifuensis has been successfully applied for the biological control of aphids, especially M. persicae , in green houses and fields in China. The corresponding parasites, as well as its mate-searching behaviors, are subjects of considerable interest. Previous A. gifuensis transcriptome studies have relied on short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS), and the vast majority of the resulting isotigs do not represent full-length cDNA. Here, we employed a combination of NGS and single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing of virgin females (VFs), mated females (MFs), virgin males (VMs), and mated males (MMs) to comprehensively study the A. gifuensis transcriptome. Behavioral responses to the aphid alarm pheromone (E-β-farnesene, EBF) as well as to A. gifuensis of the opposite sex were also studied. VMs were found to be attracted by female wasps and MFs were repelled by male wasps, whereas MMs and VFs did not respond to the opposite sex. In addition, VFs, MFs, and MMs were attracted by EBF, while VMs did not respond. According to these results, we performed a personalized differential gene expression analysis of olfactory gene sets (66 odorant receptors, 25 inotropic receptors, 16 odorant-binding proteins, and 12 chemosensory proteins) in virgin and mated A. gifuensis of both sexes, and identified 13 candidate genes whose expression levels were highly consistent with behavioral test results, suggesting potential functions for these genes in pheromone perception."

"30545292","abstracttext_background","A number of Pyricularia species are known to infect different grass species. In the case of Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae), distinct populations are known to be adapted to a wide variety of grass hosts, including rice, wheat and many other grasses. The genome sizes of Pyricularia species are typical for filamentous ascomycete fungi [~ 40 Mbp for P. oryzae, and ~ 45 Mbp for P. grisea]. Genome plasticity, mediated in part by deletions promoted by recombination between repetitive elements [Genome Res 26:1091-1100, 2016, Nat Rev Microbiol 10:417-430,2012] and transposable elements [Annu Rev Phytopathol 55:483-503,2017] contributes to host adaptation. Therefore, comparisons of genome structure of individual species will provide insight into the evolution of host specificity. However, except for the P. oryzae subgroup, little is known about the gene content or genome organization of other Pyricularia species, such as those infecting Pennisetum grasses."
"30545292","abstracttext_results","Here, we report the genome sequence of P. penniseti strain P1609 isolated from a Pennisetum grass (JUJUNCAO) using PacBio SMRT sequencing technology.

"30545367","abstracttext_background","For the success of the malaria control and eradication programme it is essential to reduce parasite transmission by mosquito vectors. In the midguts of mosquitoes fed with parasite-infected blood, sexual-stage parasites fertilize to develop into motile ookinetes that traverse midgut epithelial cells and reside adjacent the basal lamina. Therefore, the ookinete is a promising target of transmission-blocking vaccines to break the parasite lifecycle in mosquito vectors. However, the molecular mechanisms of ookinete formation and invasion of epithelial cells have not been fully elucidated. A unique structure called the crystalloid body has been identified in the ookinete cytoplasm by electron microscopy, but its biological functions remain unclear."
"30545367","abstracttext_methods","A recombinant protein of a novel molecule, designated as crystalloid body specific PH domain-containing protein of Plasmodium yoelii (PyCryPH), was synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free system.

In addition, PyCryPH knockout parasites were generated by targeted gene disruption to examine PyCryPH function in mosquito-stage parasite development."
"30545367","abstracttext_results","Western blot and immunofluorescence assays using specific antibodies showed that PyCryPH is specifically expressed in zygotes and ookinetes. By immunoelectron microscopy it was demonstrated that PyCryPH is localized within crystalloid bodies.

In addition, the number of sporozoites residing in salivary glands was comparable to that of wild-type parasites."
"30545367","abstracttext_conclusions","CryPH, containing a signal peptide and PH domain, is predominantly expressed in zygotes and ookinetes and is localized to crystalloid bodies in P. yoelii. CryPH accumulates in vesicle-like structures prior to the appearance of typical crystalloid bodies. Unlike other known crystalloid body localized proteins, CryPH does not appear to have a multiple domain architecture characteristic of the LAP/CCp family proteins. Although CryPH is highly conserved among Plasmodium, Babesia, Theileria, and Cryptosporidium, PyCryPH is dispensable for the development of invasive ookinetes and sporozoites in mosquito bodies."

"30540790","abstracttext","RWP-RKs represent a small family of transcription factors (TFs) that are unique to plants and function particularly under conditions of nitrogen starvation. These RWP-RKs have been classified in two sub-families, NLPs (NIN-like proteins) and RKDs (RWP-RK domain proteins). NLPs regulate tissue-specific expression of genes involved in nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and RKDs regulate expression of genes involved in gametogenesis/embryogenesis. During the present study, using in silico approach, 37 wheat RWP-RK genes were identified, which included 18 TaNLPs (2865 to 7340 bp with 4/5 exons), distributed on 15 chromosomes from 5 homoeologous groups (with two genes each on 4B,4D and 5A) and 19 TaRKDs (1064 to 5768 bp with 1 to 6 exons) distributed on 12 chromosomes from 4 homoeologous groups (except groups 1, 4 and 5); 2-3 splice variants were also available in 9 of the 37 genes. Sixteen (16) of these genes also carried 24 SSRs (simple sequence repeats), while 11 genes had targets for 13 different miRNAs. At the protein level, MD simulation analysis suggested their interaction with nitrate-ions. Significant differences were observed in the expression of only two (TaNLP1 and TaNLP2) of the nine representative genes that were used for in silico expression analysis under varying levels of N at post-anthesis stage (data for other genes was not available for in silico expression analysis). Differences in expression were also observed during qRT-PCR, when expression of four representative genes (TaNLP2, TaNLP7, TaRKD6 and TaRKD9) was examined in roots and shoots of seedlings (under different conditions of N supply) in two contrasting genotypes which differed in NUE (C306 with low NUE and HUW468 with high NUE). These four genes for qRT-PCR were selected on the basis of previous literature, level of homology and the level of expression (in silico study). In particular, the TaNLP7 gene showed significant up-regulation in the roots and shoots of HUW468 (with higher NUE) during N-starvation; this gene has already been characterized in Arabidopsis and tobacco, and is known to be involved in nitrate-signal transduction pathway."

"30165117","abstracttext","Essential polyunsaturated fatty acids with more than two double bonds and length of carbon chain 18-22 must be taken in the diet to prevent diseases and imbalances caused by their deficiency. Terrestrial sources of polyunsaturated fatty acids are limited to only a few plant species whose large-scale cultivation is not possible and the production of their seeds and oil is ineffective. The complete biosynthetic pathway of fatty acids is known in organisms, including plants. After the first gene encoding the enzyme catalysing the initial steps of PUFA biosynthesis (ω-3 desaturase, Δ6-desaturase) were isolated, isolation of other genes encoding relevant enzymes of the PUFA pathway from different donor organisms followed. Genetic transformations of model plants by the desaturase- and elongase-encoding genes opened the way for the genetic engineering of oilseed crop species. Some of the developed transgenic plants produced PUFAs, including eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids. Seed oils extracted from them were similar to fish oil. Tools of the synthetic biology can be applied in modifications of the PUFA pathway and also in overcoming of limitations when the gene and its expression product are absent in the pathway. Such progress in cereals (barley, wheat, maize) has been made only recently, when the first successful modifications of the ω-3 and ω-6 PUFA pathways succeeded. This review focuses on genetic modifications of the PUFA biosynthetic pathway in cereals in relation to the status reached in model plants and oilseed crops."

"30194577","abstracttext","Knowledge about the impacts of fresh and field-aged biochar amendments on greenhouse gas (CH 4 , N 2 O) emissions is limited. A field experiment was initiated in 2012 to study the effects of fresh and field-aged biochar additions on CH 4 and N 2 O emissions and the associated microbial activity during the entire rice-growing season in typical rice-wheat rotation system in Southeast China. CH 4 and N 2 O fluxes were monitored, and the abundance of methanogen (mcrA), methanotrophy (pmoA), ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), nitrite reductase (nirS, nirK), N 2 O reductase (nosZ), and potential soil enzyme activities related to CH 4 and N 2 O were simultaneously measured throughout different rice developmental stages. There were three treatments: control (urea without biochar), fresh BC (urea with fresh biochar added in 2015), and aged BC (urea with 3-year field-aged biochar added in 2012). Results showed that field-aged biochar significantly decreased seasonal CH 4 emissions by 16.8% in relation to the fresh biochar, though no significant differences were detected between biochars and control treatment. The structural equation model indicated that soil pH, microbial biomass carbon (MBC), pmoA, and mcrA were the main factors directly influenced by fresh and aged biochar amendments; aged biochar showed a negative effect while fresh biochar showed positive effects on CH 4 fluxes. Both fresh and field-aged biochar obviously increased AOA and AOB abundances and reduced the (nirS+nirK)/nosZ ratio during the entire rice-growing season, although no significant effects were observed on seasonal N 2 O emissions. Therefore, biochar amendment produced long-term effects on total CH 4 and N 2 O emissions through observed influences of soil pH and functional gene abundance. The figure shows how fresh and field-aged biochar differentially affected CH4 production and oxidation and N2O production and reduction through related functional gene abundances. Blue arrows indicate suppressing while pink arrows indicate promoting effect."

"30161200","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON) contamination of cereal grains caused by Fusarium head blight may be addressed by future RNA interference (RNAi)-based gene silencing approaches. However, utilizing these approaches will require a greater understanding of the principles that govern RNAi effectiveness in the pathogen Fusarium graminearum. RNAi in higher eukaryotes, including fungi, involves processing double stranded RNA (dsRNA) into small interfering RNA (siRNA) that silence gene expression based on base pair complementarity. This study examined virulence, DON production, and the small RNA (sRNA) populations in response to RNAi-based silencing of TRI6, a transcription factor that positively regulates DON synthesis via control of TRI5 expression. Silencing was accomplished via the expression of transgenes encoding inverted repeats targeting various regions of TRI6 (RNAi vectors). Transgene expression was associated with novel, TRI6-specific siRNAs. For RNAi vectors targeting the majority of TRI6 sequence (~600 bp), a discontinuous, repeatable pattern was observed in which most siRNAs mapped to specific regions of TRI6. Targeting shorter regions (250-350 bp) did not alter the siRNA populations corresponding to that region of TRI6. No phased processing was observed. The 5' base of ~83% of siRNAs was uracil, consistent with DICER processing and ARGONAUTE binding preferences for siRNA. Mutant lines showed TRI6 siRNA-associated reductions of TRI5 expression on toxin inducing media and DON in infected wheat and barley spikes. Shorter RNAi vectors resulted in variable levels of silencing that were less than for the ~600 bp RNAi vector, with a 343 bp RNAi vector targeting the 5' end of TRI6 having the best silencing efficiency. This work identifies efficient shorter region for silencing of TRI6 and describes the patterns of siRNA corresponding to those regions."

"30835262","abstracttext","Pyricularia is a fungal genus comprising several pathogenic species causing the blast disease in monocots. Pyricularia oryzae, the best-known species, infects rice, wheat, finger millet, and other crops. As past comparative and population genomics studies mainly focused on isolates of P. oryzae, the genomes of the other Pyricularia species have not been well explored. In this study, we obtained a chromosomal-level genome assembly of the finger millet isolate P. oryzae MZ5-1-6 and also highly contiguous assemblies of Pyricularia sp. LS, P. grisea, and P. pennisetigena. The differences in the genomic content of repetitive DNA sequences could largely explain the variation in genome size among these new genomes. Moreover, we found extensive gene gains and losses and structural changes among Pyricularia genomes, including a large interchromosomal translocation. We searched for homologs of known blast effectors across fungal taxa and found that most avirulence effectors are specific to Pyricularia, whereas many other effectors share homologs with distant fungal taxa. In particular, we discovered a novel effector family with metalloprotease activity, distinct from the well-known AVR-Pita family. We predicted 751 gene families containing putative effectors in 7 Pyricularia genomes and found that 60 of them showed differential expression in the P. oryzae MZ5-1-6 transcriptomes obtained under experimental conditions mimicking the pathogen infection process. In summary, this study increased our understanding of the structural, functional, and evolutionary genomics of the blast pathogen and identified new potential effector genes, providing useful data for developing crops with durable resistance."

"30857630","abstracttext","Myosoton aquaticum L., a widespread and competitive winter weed of wheat in China, has evolved resistance to many classes of herbicides. In one M. aquaticum population (AH03), collected from Anhui Province, where tribenuron-methyl and florasulam had been used to control this weed resistance to both herbicides had evolved. Compared with the sensitive population, HN03(S), the resistant (R) population, AH03, was highly resistant to tribenuron-methyl, flucarbazone-Na and pyroxsulam, moderately resistant to pyrithiobac‑sodium, and florasulam, and had low resistance to diflufenican. AH03 was still controlled by imazethapyr, 2,4-D butylate, fluroxypyr-meptyl, and isoproturon. Pretreatment with the P450 inhibitor malathion reduced the GR 50 value of tribenuron-methyl by 43% in the R population, and by 25% in the S population. This indicates that P450-mediated enhanced metabolism is one likely mechanism for tribenuron-methyl resistance in M. aquaticum. Glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity could be induced by tribenuron-methyl in both the R and S populations. However, both the basal and induced GST activity of the R population was lower than that of the S population. The in vitro ALS assay confirmed that the ALS from the R plants showed a high resistance (52.93-fold) to tribenuron-methyl. ALS gene sequencing revealed a Pro197Ala substitution in the R plants. Based on the ALS gene sequence analysis, molecular markers were also developed to identify the specific Pro197Ala mutation. This population of M. aquaticum has multiple resistance and target-site (ALS Pro197Ala) and non-target-site resistance mechanisms contribute to tribenuron-methyl resistance."

"30933666","abstracttext","The methylcitrate cycle metabolizes propionyl-CoA, a toxic metabolite, into pyruvate. Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae ) is a phytopathogenic fungus that causes a destructive blast disease in rice and wheat. We characterized the essential roles of the methylcitrate cycle in the development and virulence of P. oryzae using functional genomics. In P. oryzae , the transcript levels of MCS1 and MCL1 , which encode a 2-methylcitrate synthase and a 2-methylisocitrate lyase, respectively, were upregulated during appressorium formation and when grown on propionyl-CoA-producing carbon sources. We found that deletion of MCS1 and MCL1 inhibited fungal growth on media containing both glucose and propionate, and media using propionate or propionyl-CoA-producing amino acids (valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine) as the sole carbon or nitrogen sources. The Δ mcs1 mutant formed sparse aerial hyphae and did not produce conidia on complete medium (CM), while the Δ mcl1 mutant showed decreased conidiation. The aerial mycelium of Δ mcs1 displayed a lowered NAD + /NADH ratio, reduced nitric oxide content, and downregulated transcription of hydrophobin genes. Δ mcl1 showed reduced appressorium turgor, severely delayed plant penetration, and weakened virulence. Addition of acetate recovered the growth of the wild type and Δ mcs1 on medium containing both glucose and propionate and recovered the conidiation of both Δ mcs1 and Δ mcl1 on CM by reducing propionyl-CoA formation. Deletion of MCL1 together with ICL1 , an isocitrate lyase gene in the glyoxylate cycle, greatly reduced the mutant's virulence as compared with the single-gene deletion mutants (Δ icl1 and Δ mcl1 ). This experimental evidence provides important information about the role of the methylcitrate cycle in development and virulence of P. oryzae by detoxification of propionyl-CoA and 2-methylisocitrate."

"30731861","abstracttext","Understanding of long-term virulence dynamics of pathogen populations in response to host resistance gene deployment is of major importance for disease management and evolutionary biology. We monitored the virulence dynamics of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat stripe rust, over 25 years in France. Virulence dynamics was explained by estimates of area associated with resistance genes carried by farmers' cultivars. The epidemics assessed through disease severity significantly correlated with the number of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates collected each year, used to describe virulence dynamics. In the south, the dominance of the Mediterranean pathotype 6E16 and the cultivation of a susceptible cultivar were associated with an epidemic from 1997 to 1999. In the north, five epidemics occurred due to successive acquisition of virulence to the resistance genes Yr7, Yr6, Yr9, Yr17, and Yr32, either by acquisition of the virulence in the previous dominant pathotype or by incursion or selection of one or two new pathotypes. Frequency of pathotypes with Vr7 and Vr6 declined with the reduction in the cultivation of corresponding Yr gene cultivars, whereas the virulence Vr9 persisted longer than the cultivation of Yr9 cultivars. Although the first pathotypes carrying Vr9 decreased, this virulence persisted in other pathotypes even in the absence of Yr9 cultivars. At the regional level, Yr9 cultivars in the north caused a shift from high Vr6 frequency to high Vr9 frequency whereas, in the central region, where Yr9 cultivars were rare, Vr6 remained prevalent."
"30679260","articletitle","Homeologous Epistasis in Wheat: The Search for an Immortal Hybrid."
"30679260","abstracttext","Hybridization between related species results in the formation of an allopolyploid with multiple subgenomes. These subgenomes will each contain complete, yet evolutionarily divergent, sets of genes. Like a diploid hybrid, allopolyploids will have two versions, or homeoalleles, for every gene. Partial functional redundancy between homeologous genes should result in a deviation from additivity. These epistatic interactions between homeoalleles are analogous to dominance effects, but are fixed across subgenomes through self pollination. An allopolyploid can be viewed as an immortalized hybrid, with the opportunity to select and fix favorable homeoallelic interactions within inbred varieties. We present a subfunctionalization epistasis model to estimate the degree of functional redundancy between homeoallelic loci and a statistical framework to determine their importance within a population. We provide an example using the homeologous dwarfing genes of allohexaploid wheat, Rht-1 , and search for genome-wide patterns indicative of homeoallelic subfunctionalization in a breeding population. Using the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0 sequence, 23,796 homeoallelic gene sets were identified and anchored to the nearest DNA marker to form 10,172 homeologous marker sets. Interaction predictors constructed from products of marker scores were used to fit the homeologous main and interaction effects, as well as estimate whole genome genetic values. Some traits displayed a pattern indicative of homeoallelic subfunctionalization, while other traits showed a less clear pattern or were not affected. Using genomic prediction accuracy to evaluate importance of marker interactions, we show that homeologous interactions explain a portion of the nonadditive genetic signal, but are less important than other epistatic interactions."

"30590165","abstracttext","Limited availability of sustainable feed ingredients is a serious concern in salmon aquaculture. Insects may become an important, sustainable resource for expanding the raw material repertoire. Herein, we present data from an 8-week feeding trial with pre-smolt Atlantic salmon (initial body weight 49 ± 1.5 g) fed either a reference diet containing fish meal, soy protein concentrate and wheat gluten as protein sources, or a test diet wherein 85% of the protein was supplied by black soldier fly larvae meal. Possible diet effect on the systemic immune response was evaluated by measuring plasma antibody titers after vaccination against infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV). The gut health of fish was evaluated using endpoints including organ and tissue indices, histopathological parameters and gene expression. Both diets induced the same level of antibody responses against IPNV. In fish fed the reference diet, the histological examination of the pyloric caeca mucosa showed clear hyper-vacuolization suggestive of lipid accumulation in enterocytes, whereas this was less pronounced in the insect meal fed fish. Expression of genes relevant to lipid metabolism confirmed these histological findings. Immune and barrier-function gene expression profiles were both generally not affected by diet. However, the fish fed insect meal showed increased expression of genes indicative of stress response, immune tolerance and increased detoxification activity. In summary, our results showed no indications that dietary inclusion of insect meal affected the gut health of Atlantic salmon negatively. The insect meal based diet seemed to reduce excessive lipid deposition in the pyloric caeca and stimulate xenobiotic metabolism."

"30691469","abstracttext_background","Research on filamentous fungi emphasized the remarkable redundancy in genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes, the similarities but also the large differences in their expression, especially through the role of the XlnR/XYR1 transcriptional activator. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the specificities of the industrial fungus Talaromyces versatilis, getting clues into the role of XlnR and the importance of glucose repression at the transcriptional level, to provide further levers for cocktail production."
"30691469","abstracttext_results","By studying a set of 62 redundant genes representative of several categories of enzymes, our results underlined the huge plasticity of transcriptional responses when changing nutritional status. As a general trend, the more heterogeneous the substrate, the more efficient to trigger activation. Genetic modifications of xlnR led to significant reorganisation of transcriptional patterns. Just a minimal set of genes actually fitted in a simplistic model of regulation by a transcriptional activator, and this under specific substrates. On the contrary, the diversity of xlnR + versus ΔxlnR responses illustrated the existence of complex and unpredicted patterns of co-regulated genes that were highly dependent on the culture condition, even between genes that encode members of a functional category of enzymes. They notably revealed a dual, substrate-dependant repressor-activator role of XlnR, with counter-intuitive transcripts regulations that targeted specific genes. About glucose, it appeared as a formal repressive sugar as we observed a massive repression of most genes upon glucose addition to the mycelium grown on wheat straw. However, we also noticed a positive role of this sugar on the basal expression of a few genes, (notably those encoding cellulases), showing again the strong dependence of these regulatory mechanisms upon promoter and nutritional contexts."
"30691469","abstracttext_conclusions","The diversity of transcriptional patterns appeared to be the rule, while common and stable behaviour, both within gene families and with fungal literature, the exception. The setup of a new biotechnological process to reach optimized, if not customized expression patterns of enzymes, hence appeared tricky just relying on published data that can lead, in the best scenario, to approximate trends. We instead encourage preliminary experimental assays, carried out in the context of interest to reassess gene responses, as a mandatory step before thinking in (genetic) strategies for the improvement of enzyme production in fungi."

"30693009","abstracttext","Genome Editing using engineered endonuclease (GEEN) systems rapidly took over the field of plant science and plant breeding. So far, Genome Editing techniques have been applied in more than fifty different plants; including model species like Arabidopsis; main crops like rice, maize or wheat as well as economically less important crops like strawberry, peanut and cucumber. These techniques have been used for basic research as proof-of-concept or to investigate gene functions in most of its applications. However, several market-oriented traits have been addressed including enhanced agronomic characteristics, improved food and feed quality, increased tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress and herbicide tolerance. These technologies are evolving at a tearing pace and especially the field of CRISPR based Genome Editing is advancing incredibly fast. CRISPR-Systems derived from a multitude of bacterial species are being used for targeted Gene Editing and many modifications have already been applied to the existing CRISPR-Systems such as (i) alter their protospacer adjacent motif (ii) increase their specificity (iii) alter their ability to cut DNA and (iv) fuse them with additional proteins. Besides, the classical transformation system using Agrobacteria tumefaciens or Rhizobium rhizogenes , other transformation technologies have become available and additional methods are on its way to the plant sector. Some of them are utilizing solely proteins or protein-RNA complexes for transformation, making it possible to alter the genome without the use of recombinant DNA. Due to this, it is impossible that foreign DNA is being incorporated into the host genome. In this review we will present the recent developments and techniques in the field of DNA-free Genome Editing, its advantages and pitfalls and give a perspective on technologies which might be available in the future for targeted Genome Editing in plants. Furthermore, we will discuss these techniques in the light of existing- and potential future regulations."

"31871614","abstracttext","Tubby-like proteins (TLPs) are ubiquitous in eukaryotes and function in abiotic stress tolerance of some plants. Cassava ( Manihot esculenta Crantz) is a high-yield starch root crop and has a high tolerance to poor soil conditions and abiotic stress. However, little is known about TLP gene characteristics and their expression in cassava. We identified cassava TLP genes, MeTLP s, and further analysed structure, duplication, chromosome localization and collinearity, cis -acting elements in the promoter regions and expression patterns of MeTLP s, and three-dimensional structure of the encoded proteins MeTLPs. In conclusion, there is a MeTLP family containing 13 members, which are grouped into A and C subfamilies. There are 11 pairs of MeTLP s that show the duplication which took place between 10.11 and 126.69 million years ago. Two MeTLP s 6 and 9 likely originate from one gene in an ancestral species, may be common ancestors for other MeTLP s and would most likely not be eligible for ubiquitin-related protein degradation because their corresponding proteins (MeTLPs 6 and 9) have no the F-box domain in the N-terminus. MeTLP s feature differences in the number from TLP s in wheat, apple, Arabidopsis , poplar and maize, and are highlighted by segmental duplication but more importantly by the chromosomal collinearity with potato StTLP s. MeTLP s are at least related to abiotic stress tolerance in cassava. However, the subtle differences in function among MeTLP s are predictable partly because of their differential expression profiles, which are coupled with various cis ‑acting elements existing in the promoter regions depending on genes."

"31492664","abstracttext","p -Benzoquinone (BQ) is a lignin-derived inhibitor of biorefinery fermentation strains produced during pretreatment of lignocellulose. Unlike the well-studied inhibitors furan aldehydes, weak acids, and phenolics, the inhibitory properties of BQ, the microbial tolerance mechanism, and the detoxification strategy for this inhibitor have not been clearly elucidated. Here, BQ was identified as a by-product generated during acid pretreatment of various lignocellulose feedstocks, including corn stover, wheat straw, rice straw, tobacco stem, sunflower stem, and corncob residue. BQ at 20 to 200 mg/liter severely inhibited the cell growth and fermentability of various bacteria and yeast strains used in biorefinery fermentations. The BQ tolerance of the strains was found to be closely related to their capacity to convert BQ to nontoxic hydroquinone (HQ). To identify the key genes responsible for BQ tolerance, transcription levels of 20 genes potentially involved in the degradation of BQ in Zymomonas mobilis were investigated using real-time quantitative PCR in BQ-treated cells. One oxidoreductase gene, one hydroxylase gene, three reductase genes, and three dehydrogenase genes were found to be responsible for the conversion of BQ to HQ. Overexpression of the five key genes in Z. mobilis ( ZMO1696 , ZMO1949 , ZMO1576 , ZMO1984 , and ZMO1399 ) accelerated its cell growth and cellulosic ethanol production in BQ-containing medium and lignocellulose hydrolysates. IMPORTANCE This study advances our understanding of BQ inhibition behavior and the mechanism of microbial tolerance to this inhibitor and identifies the key genes responsible for BQ detoxification. The insights here into BQ toxicity and tolerance provide the basis for future synthetic biology to engineer industrial fermentation strains with enhanced BQ tolerance."

"31200809","abstracttext","With the availability of DNA-based molecular markers during early 1980s and that of sophisticated statistical tools in late 1980s and later, it became possible to identify genomic regions that control a quantitative trait. The two methods used for this purpose included quantitative trait loci (QTL) interval mapping and genome-wide association mapping/studies (GWAS). Both these methods have their own merits and demerits, so that newer approaches were developed in order to deal with the demerits. We have now entered a post-GWAS era, where either the original data on individual genotypes are being used again keeping in view the results of GWAS or else summary statistics obtained through GWAS is subjected to further analysis. The first half of this review briefly deals with the approaches that were used for GWAS, the GWAS results obtained in some major crops (maize, wheat, rice, sorghum and soybean), their utilization for crop improvement and the improvements made to address the limitations of original GWA studies (computational demand, multiple testing and false discovery, rare marker alleles, etc.). These improvements included the development of multi-locus and multi-trait analysis, joint linkage association mapping, etc. Since originally GWA studies were used for mere identification of marker-trait association for marker-assisted selection, the second half of the review is devoted to activities in post-GWAS era, which include different methods that are being used for identification of causal variants and their prioritization (meta-analysis, pathway-based analysis, methylation QTL), functional characterization of candidate signals, gene- and gene-set based association mapping, GWAS using high dimensional data through machine learning, etc. The last section deals with popular resources available for GWAS in plants in the post-GWAS era and the implications of the results of post-GWAS for crop improvement."

Based on their phylogenic relationships to GRAS genes in rice and maize, BdGRAS genes can be divided into ten subfamilies in which members of the same subfamily showed similar protein sequences, conserved motifs and gene structures, suggesting possible conserved functions. Although expression variation is high, some BdGRAS genes are tissue-specific, phytohormones- or abiotic stresses-responsive, and they may play key roles in development, signal transduction pathways and stress responses. In addition, DELLA genes BdSLR1 and BdSLRL1 were functionally characterized to play a role in plant growth via the GA signal pathway, consistent with GO annotations and KEGG pathway analyses."

This study focused on determining the relative expression profiles of the genes associated with hormone-dependent pathways in two near-isogenic wheat lines when attacked by cereal aphids. Infestation with Rhopalosiphum padi Linnaeus (Hemiptera: Aphididae) and/or Sitobion avenae Fabricius (Hemiptera: Aphididae) significantly upregulated the expression of marker genes related to the salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent pathways in the tested lines. In the resistant line 35-E4, previous infestation with R. padi significantly increased the relative expression of plant pathogenesis-related protein 1 at all sampling times but did not have a significant effect on the expression of the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) gene. In addition, the expression levels of the lipoxygenase (LOX) and allene oxide synthase (AOS) genes immediately increased after the aphid attack. In susceptible line 35-A20, infestation with either R. padi or S. avenae led to significantly increased expression levels of the AOS and PAL genes. Moreover, sequential aphid infestation induced higher expression of AOS compared with a single-species aphid infestation, whereas the expression of the PAL gene was antagonistically affected by sequential aphid infestation. Overall, these results showed that aphid infestation induced SA- and JA-dependent responses in host plants. However, the expression profiles of these genes in resistant and susceptible host lines were significantly different."

We previously reported the purification of a glycoprotein, plerocercoid-immunosuppressive factor (P-ISF) from the excretory/secretory products of S. erinaceieuropaei plerocercoids that may be involved in immuno-modification. We determined the sequence of P-ISF from the N-terminal and the internal 10 amino acids of P-ISF using degenerate PCR and 5'- and 3'-RACE methods. The putative gene encoding P-ISF was 1443 bp long and the gene contained 10 exons and 9 introns in a genomic DNA of size 5205 bp. P-ISF consists of 480 amino acids including the N-terminal signal peptide sequence, and has two unknown domains,-cestoda cysteine-rich domains (CCDs) and a fibronectin type III domain between the two CCDs. All cysteine residues were conserved in the two CCDs, which shared 62% amino acid identities. Homologous analysis revealed that the CCDs were homologous with an unknown protein of Diphyllobothrium latum. To produce specific antibodies, we expressed recombinant P-ISF (rP-ISF) using wheat germ protein synthetic system. P-ISF was localized in the sub-cutaneous tissues and the parenchymal tissues of plerocercoids. Transcription of P-ISF was detected only in plerocercoid stage, but not in adult stage. Western blotting also showed a band in plerocercoide stage but not in adult. The rP-ISF did not suppress nitrite production in RAW 264.7 cells stimulated with LPS, and this might be due to lack of carbohydrate chains in the recombinant protein."

"32007128","abstracttext","Genome-wide transcriptome analysis was undertaken in a leaf-rust resistant bread wheat line CSP44 (selected from Australian cv. Condor) carrying the adult plant resistance (APR) gene Lr48. Two pre-adult plant (P-AP) susceptible stages (S48 and S96) and two adult plant (AP) resistant stages (R48 and R96) were used for RNA-seq. At the susceptible P-AP stage (during S48 to S96), expression increased in 2062 genes, and declined in 130 genes; 1775 of 2062 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) also exhibited high expression during early incompatible stage R48. Comparison of S96 with R96 showed that the expression of 80 genes was enhanced and that of 208 genes declined at the AP stage. At the resistant AP stage (during R48 to R96), expression of mere 25 genes increased and that of 126 genes declined. Apparently, the resistance during late adult stage (R96) is caused by regulation of the expression of relatively fewer genes, although at pre-adult stage (S48 to S96), expression of large number of genes increased; expression of majority of these genes kept on increasing during adult stage at R48 also. These and other results of the present study suggest that APR may mimic some kind of systemic acquired resistance (SAR). The host-specific DEGs belonged to 10 different classes including genes involved in defence, transport, epigenetics, photosynthesis, genes encoding some transcription factors etc. The pathogen (Puccinia triticina) specific DEGs (including three genes encoding known biotrophic effectors) seem to help the pathogen in infection/growth through large-scale stage-specific enhanced expression of host's genes. A putative candidate gene for Lr48 containing protein kinase domain (its ortholog in rice encoding OsWAK8) was also identified."

A specially designed rhizobox was used in the present study to investigate the N processes in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of winter wheat applied with different rates of Mo fertilizer. (1) In the rhizosphere soil, pH values increased with increasing rates of Mo application, nitrate (NO 3 - -N) accumulated at the rates of 0.15 and 0.3 mg Mo kg -1 , potential denitrification activity (PDA) was significantly reduced by application of 0.15-1 mg Mo kg -1 , and the copy numbers of narG and nosZ genes were increased by application of 0.15-1 mg Mo kg -1 . (2) In the non-rhizosphere soil, NO 3 - -N content decreased by application of 0.15-0.3 mg Mo kg -1 , and narG gene abundance increased obviously by application of 0.3-1 mg Mo kg -1 . (3) Soil pH, NO 3 - -N, apparent nitrification rate (ANR), and nosZ gene abundance were significantly higher in rhizosphere than in non-rhizosphere soil. On the contrary, NH 4 + -N and total N, PDA, the abundance of AOB, and nirK and nirS genes were significantly higher in non-rhizosphere soil. The results indicated that the N transformations in rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils were differently affected by soil application of Mo fertilizer, and rhizosphere played a more important role in soil N cycle processes. The regulatory effects of Mo on these processes were to increase plant biomass and N uptake, promote the NO 3 - -N accumulation in rhizosphere soil, and weaken the denitrification in both rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils."

"32032378","abstracttext","The objective of this research was to evaluate activation of the ileal brake in broiler chickens using diets containing semi-purified wheat (WS; rapidly and highly digested) and pea (PS; slowly and poorly digested) starch. Diets were formulated to contain six WS:PS ratios (100:0, 80:20, 60:40, 40:60, 20:80, 0:100) and each starch ratio was fed to 236 Ross 308 male broilers housed in 4 litter floor pens. At 28 d of age, the effect of PS concentration was assessed on starch digestion, digestive tract morphology, and digesta pH and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) concentration. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY) status were assessed in serum (ELISA) and via gene expression in jejunal and ileal tissue (proglucagon for GLP-1). Data were analyzed using regression analyses, and significance was accepted at P ≤ 0.05. Increasing dietary PS resulted in reduced starch digestibility in the small intestine, but had no effect in the colon. Crop content pH responded quadratically to PS level with an estimated minimum at 55% PS. Total SCFA increased linearly in the crop with PS level, but changed in a quadratic fashion in the ileum (estimated maximum at 62% PS). Ceacal SCFA concentrations were highest for the 80 and 100% PS levels. The relative empty weight (crop, small intestine, colon), length (small intestine) and content (crop jejunum, Ileum) of digestive tract sections increased linearly with increasing PS concentration. Dietary treatment did not affect serum GLP-1 or PYY or small intestine transcript abundance. In conclusion, feeding PS increased the presence of L-cell activators (starch, SCFA) and increased trophic development and content of the digestive tract, suggestive of L-cell activation. However, no direct evidence of ileal brake activation was found by measuring venous blood levels of GLP-1 or PYY or corresponding gene expression in small intestine tissue."

"31195958","abstracttext_background","With rising global temperature, understanding plants' adaptation to heat stress has implications in plant breeding. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding, regulatory RNAs guiding gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, small RNAs and the degradome (parallel analysis of RNA ends) of leaf tissues collected from control and heat-stressed wheat plants immediately at the end of the stress period and 1 and 4 days later were analysed."
"31195958","abstracttext_results","Sequencing of 24 small RNA libraries produced 55.2 M reads while 404 M reads were obtained from the corresponding 24 PARE libraries.

The PARE analysis identified 589 transcripts targeted by 84 of the ascertained miRNAs. PARE sequencing validated the targets of the conserved members of miRNA156, miR166 and miR393 families as squamosa promoter-binding-like, homeobox leucine-zipper and transport inhibitor responsive proteins, respectively. Heat stress responsive miRNA targeted superoxide dismutases and an array of homeobox leucine-zipper proteins, F-box proteins and protein kinases. Query of miRNA targets to interactome databases revealed a predominant association of stress responses such as signalling, antioxidant activity and ubiquitination to superoxide dismutases, F-box proteins, pentatricopeptide repeat-containing proteins and mitochondrial transcription termination factor-like proteins."

"31254227","abstracttext","Feruloyl esterases (FAEs) have great potential applications in paper and breeding industry. A new thermo-stable feruloyl esterase gene, TtfaeB was identified from the thermophilic fungus Thielavia terrestris h408. Deduced protein sequence shares the identity of 67% with FAEB from Neurospora crassa. The expression vector pPIC9K-TtfaeB was successfully constructed and electro-transformed into GS115 strain of Pichia pastoris. One transformant with high feruloyl esterase yield was obtained through plate screening and named TtFAEB1. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis of fermentation supernatant from transformant TtFAEB1 showed a distinct protein band appearing at the position of about 35-kDa, indicating that TtfaeB gene has been successfully expressed in P. pastoris. The recombinant TtFAEB was purified by affinity chromatography and the specific activity of purified TtFAEB was 6.06 ± 0.72 U/mg. The optimal temperature and pH for purified recombinant TtFAEB was 60 °C and 7.0, respectively. TtFAEB was thermostable, retaining 96.89 and 84.16% of the maximum activity after being treated for 1 h at 50 °C and 60 °C, respectively. Additionally, the enzyme was stable in the pH range 4.5-8.0. The homology model of TtFAEB showed that it consists of a single domain adopting a typical α/β-hydrolase fold and contains a catalytic triad formed by Ser117, Asp201, and His260. TtFAEB in association with xylanase from Trichoderma reesei could release 77.1% of FA from destarched wheat bran. The present results indicated that the recombinant TtFAEB with excellent enzymatic properties is a promising candidate for potential applications in biomass deconstruction and biorefinery."
"31471638","articletitle","The P5-type ATPase Spf1 is required for development and virulence of the rice blast fungus Pyricularia oryzae."
"31471638","abstracttext","Pyricularia oryzae (synonym Magnaporthe oryzae) is a plant pathogen causing major yield losses in cultivated rice and wheat. The P-type ATPases play important roles in cellular processes of fungi, plants, and animals via transporting specific substrates through ATP hydrolysis. Here, we characterized the roles of a P5-ATPase, Spf1, in the development and virulence of P. oryzae. Deletion of SPF1 led to decreased hyphal growth and conidiation, delayed spore germination and appressorium formation, reduced penetration and invasive hyphal extension, and attenuated virulence. Appressorium turgor, however, was not affected by deletion of SPF1. The co-localization of Spf1-GFP and an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker protein, Lhs1-DsRed2, indicated that Spf1 is an ER-localized P5-ATPase. An ER stress factor, 0.5 μg/ml tunicamycin (TUNI), inhibited the growth of ∆spf1, but another ER stress factor, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), promoted the growth of ∆spf1. Treatment with chemicals for oxidative stress (5 mM H 2 O 2 and 0.8 mM paraquat) also promoted the growth of ∆spf1. Gene expression assays showed that unfolded protein response (UPR) components KAR2, OST1, PMT1, ERV29, PDI1, SCJ1, SEC61, a Ca 2+ channel-related P-type ATPase gene PMR1, and a calcineurin-dependent transcription factor CRZ1 were significantly up-regulated in ∆spf1, suggesting activation of UPR in the mutant. These lines of experimental evidence indicate that SPF1 is involved in some basal ER mechanisms of P. oryzae including UPR pathway and responses to ER related stresses, therefore, affecting fungal development and virulence. However, the detailed mechanism between Spf1 and virulence still awaits future researches."
"31575043","articletitle","Transcription Factors Associated with Abiotic and Biotic Stress Tolerance and Their Potential for Crops Improvement."
"31575043","abstracttext","In field conditions, crops are adversely affected by a wide range of abiotic stresses including drought, cold, salt, and heat, as well as biotic stresses including pests and pathogens. These stresses can have a marked effect on crop yield. The present and future effects of climate change necessitate the improvement of crop stress tolerance. Plants have evolved sophisticated stress response strategies, and genes that encode transcription factors (TFs) that are master regulators of stress-responsive genes are excellent candidates for crop improvement. Related examples in recent studies include TF gene modulation and overexpression approaches in crop species to enhance stress tolerance. However, much remains to be discovered about the diverse plant TFs. Of the >80 TF families, only a few, such as NAC, MYB, WRKY, bZIP, and ERF/DREB, with vital roles in abiotic and biotic stress responses have been intensively studied. Moreover, although significant progress has been made in deciphering the roles of TFs in important cereal crops, fewer TF genes have been elucidated in sorghum. As a model drought-tolerant crop, sorghum research warrants further focus. This review summarizes recent progress on major TF families associated with abiotic and biotic stress tolerance and their potential for crop improvement, particularly in sorghum. Other TF families and non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression are discussed briefly. Despite the emphasis on sorghum, numerous examples from wheat, rice, maize, and barley are included. Collectively, the aim of this review is to illustrate the potential application of TF genes for stress tolerance improvement and the engineering of resistant crops, with an emphasis on sorghum."

"31311507","abstracttext_background","Non-host resistance (NHR) presents a compelling long-term plant protection strategy for global food security, yet the genetic basis of NHR remains poorly understood. For many diseases, including stem rust of wheat [causal organism Puccinia graminis (Pg)], NHR is largely unexplored due to the inherent challenge of developing a genetically tractable system within which the resistance segregates. The present study turns to the pathogen's alternate host, barberry (Berberis spp.), to overcome this challenge."
"31311507","abstracttext_results","In this study, an interspecific mapping population derived from a cross between Pg-resistant Berberis thunbergii (Bt) and Pg-susceptible B. vulgaris was developed to investigate the Pg-NHR exhibited by Bt. To facilitate QTL analysis and subsequent trait dissection, the first genetic linkage maps for the two parental species were constructed and a chromosome-scale reference genome for Bt was assembled (PacBio + Hi-C). QTL analysis resulted in the identification of a single 13 cM region (~ 5.1 Mbp spanning 13 physical contigs) on the short arm of Bt chromosome 3. Differential gene expression analysis, combined with sequence variation analysis between the two parental species, led to the prioritization of several candidate genes within the QTL region, some of which belong to gene families previously implicated in disease resistance."

"31316473","articletitle","Mining the Drilosphere: Bacterial Communities and Denitrifier Abundance in a No-Till Wheat Cropping System."
"31316473","abstracttext","Earthworms play important roles in no-till cropping systems by redistributing crop residue to lower soil horizons, providing macropores for root growth, increasing water infiltration, enhancing soil quality and organic matter, and stimulating nitrogen cycling. The soil impacted by earthworm activity, including burrows, casts, and middens, is termed the drilosphere. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of earthworms on soil microbial community composition in the drilosphere at different landscape slope positions. Soil cores (50 cm depth) were extracted from three landscape locations (top, middle, and bottom slope positions) on a sloping aspect of a no-till wheat farm. Soil was sampled at the bottom of the soil core from inside multiple earthworm ( Lumbricus terrestris ) channels (drilosphere) and from adjacent bulk soil. Bacterial communities were characterized for 16S rRNA gene diversity using high-throughput sequencing and functional denitrifier gene abundance ( nirK, nirS , and nosZ ) by quantitative PCR. Bacterial communities were structured primarily by the landscape slope position of the soil core followed by source (bulk versus drilosphere soil), with a significant interaction between core position and source. The families AKIW874, Chitinophagaceae, and Comamonadaceae and the genera Amycolatopsis, Caulobacter, Nocardioides , and Variovorax were more abundant in the drilosphere compared to the bulk soil. Most of the individual bacterial taxa enriched in the drilosphere versus bulk soil were members of Actinobacteria, including Micrococcales, Gaiellaceae, Solirubrobacterales, and Mycobacterium . In general, the greatest differences in communities were observed in comparisons of the top and bottom slope positions in which the bottom slope communities had significantly greater richness, diversity, and denitrifier abundance than the top slope position. Populations of denitrifiers (i.e., ratio of nirK + nirS to 16S rRNA) were more abundant in earthworm-impacted soils and there was a significant impact of L. terrestris on soil community composition which was observed only in the top landscape position. There were significant correlations between the abundance of nirK and nirS and taxa within Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and Chloroflexi, suggesting a broad diversity of denitrifying bacteria. Earthworms influence the soil microbial communities, but the impact depends on the slope location in a variable landscape, which likely reflects different soil characteristics."

"31352584","abstracttext_key message","RNA-Seq was employed to compare the transcriptome differences between the triticale lines and to identify the key gene responsible for the blue aleurone trait. The accumulation of anthocyanins in the aleurone of triticale results in the formation of the blue-grained trait, but the identity of the genes associated with anthocyanin biosynthesis in the aleurone has not yet been reported. In this manuscript, RNA-Seq was employed to compare the transcriptome differences between the triticale lines HM13 (blue aleurone) and HM5 (white aleurone), and to identify the key genes responsible for the blue aleurone trait. There were 32,406 differentially expressed genes between HM13 and HM5. Seventy-three unigenes were homologous to the structural genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis, and the average transcript level of the structural genes was higher in HM13 than in HM5, so that quantitative differences between the two lines in transcription rates could be the cause of the blue aleurone. The MYB and bHLH transcription factors had two homologous unigenes, but contained only one differentially expressed unigene each. The relative transcript level of bHLH Unigene5672_All (TsMYC2) in HM13 was 42.71 times that in HM5, while the relative transcript level of the MYB transcription factor Unigene12228_All in HM13 was 2.20 times that in HM5. qPCR experiments determined the relative transcript level of TsMYC2 in developing grain, with the expression of TsMYC2 in grain being the highest compared with that in root, stem or leaf tissue. TsMYC2 was homologous to the bHLH transcription factor regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis and contained three entire functional domains: bHLH-MYC_N, HLH and ACT-like, which were important for exercising regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis as a bHLH transcription factor. Transient expression of ZmC1 and TsMYC2 could induce anthocyanin biosynthesis in white wheat coleoptile cells, demonstrating that TsMYC2 was a functional bHLH transcription factor. These results indicated that TsMYC2 was associated with the blue aleurone trait and could prove to be a valuable gene with which to breed new triticale cultivars with the blue aleurone trait."

Besides having different site-directed nucleases for genome editing over a decade ago, the CRISPR/Cas (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein) based genome editing approach has become a choice of technique due to its simplicity, ease of access, cost, and flexibility. In the present review, several CRISPR/Cas based approaches have been discussed, considering recent advances and challenges to implicate those in the crop improvement programs. Successful examples where CRISPR/Cas approach has been used to improve the biotic and abiotic stress tolerance, and traits related to yield and plant architecture have been discussed. The review highlights the challenges to implement the genome editing in polyploid crop plants like wheat, canola, and sugarcane. Challenges for plants difficult to transform and germline-specific gene expression have been discussed. We have also discussed the notable progress with multi-target editing approaches based on polycistronic tRNA processing, Csy4 endoribonuclease, intron processing, and Drosha ribonuclease. Potential to edit multiple targets simultaneously makes it possible to take up more challenging tasks required to engineer desired crop plants. Similarly, advances like precision gene editing, promoter bashing, and methylome-editing will also be discussed. The present review also provides a catalog of available computational tools and servers facilitating designing of guide-RNA targets, construct designs, and data analysis. The information provided here will be useful for the efficient exploration of technological advances in genome editing field for the crop improvement programs."
"32903596","articletitle","The Salt Tolerance Related Protein (STRP) Mediates Cold Stress Responses and Abscisic Acid Signalling in Arabidopsis thaliana ."
"32903596","abstracttext","Low temperature stress is one of the major causes of crop yield reduction in agriculture. The alteration of gene expression pattern and the accumulation of stress-related proteins are the main strategies activated by plants under this unfavourable condition. Here we characterize the Arabidopsis thaliana Salt Tolerance Related Protein (STRP). The protein rapidly accumulates under cold treatment, and this effect is not dependent on transcriptional activation of the STRP gene, but on the inhibition of proteasome-mediated degradation. Subcellular localization of STRP was determined by the transient expression of STRP-YFP in A. thaliana protoplasts. STRP is localized into the cytosol, nucleus, and associated to the plasma membrane. Under cold stress, the membrane-associated fraction decreases, while in the cytosol and in the nucleus STRP levels strongly increase. STRP has high similarity with WCI16, a wheat Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA)-like protein. Despite no canonical LEA motifs in the STRP sequence are present, physicochemical characterization demonstrated that STRP shares common features with LEA proteins, being a high hydrophilic unstructured protein, highly soluble after boiling and with cryoprotectant activity. To clarify the physiological function of STRP, we characterized the phenotype and the response to low temperature stress of the strp knockout mutant. The mutation causes an equal impairment of plant growth and development both in physiological and cold stress conditions. The strp mutant is more susceptible to oxidative damage respect to the wild type , showing increased lipid peroxidation and altered membrane integrity. Furthermore, the analysis of Abscisic acid (ABA) effects on protein levels demonstrated that the hormone induces the increase of STRP levels, an effect in part ascribable to its ability to activate STRP expression. ABA treatments showed that the strp mutant displays an ABA hyposensitive phenotype in terms of seed germination, root development, stomata closure and in the expression of ABA-responsive genes. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that STRP acts as a multifunctional protein in the response mechanisms to low temperature, suggesting a crucial role for this protein in stress perception and in the translation of extracellular stimuli in an intracellular response."

They disrupt the normal function of their targets by forming microProtein-target heterodimers through compatible protein-protein interaction (PPI) domains. Recent studies confirm the significance of microProteins in the fine-tuning of plant developmental processes such as shoot apical meristem maintenance and flowering time regulation. While there are a number of well-characterized microProteins in Arabidopsis thaliana , studies from more complex plant genomes are still missing. We have previously developed miPFinder, a software for identifying microProteins from annotated genomes. Here we present an improved version where we have updated the algorithm to increase its accuracy and speed, and used it to analyze five cereal crop genomes - wheat, rice, barley, maize and sorghum. We found 20,064 potential microProteins from a total of 258,029 proteins in these five organisms, of which approximately 2000 are high-confidence, i.e. , likely to function as actual microProteins. Gene ontology analysis of these 2000 microProtein candidates revealed their roles in stress, light and growth responses, hormone signaling and transcriptional regulation. Using a recently developed rice gene co-expression database, we analyzed 347 potential rice microProteins that are also conserved in other cereal crops and found over 50 of these rice microProteins to be co-regulated with their identified interaction partners. Overall, our study reveals a rich source of biotechnologically interesting small proteins that regulate fundamental plant processes such a growth and stress response that could be utilized in crop bioengineering."
"32765575","articletitle","Wild Sorghum as a Promising Resource for Crop Improvement."
"32765575","abstracttext","Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench is a multipurpose food crop which is ranked among the top five cereal crops in the world, and is used as a source of food, fodder, feed, and fuel. The genus Sorghum consists of 24 diverse species. Cultivated sorghum was derived from the wild progenitor S. bicolor subsp. verticilliflorum , which is commonly distributed in Africa. Archeological evidence has identified regions in Sudan, Ethiopia, and West Africa as centers of origin of sorghum, with evidence for more than one domestication event. The taxonomy of the genus is not fully resolved, with alternative classifications that should be resolved by further molecular analysis. Sorghum can withstand severe droughts which makes it suitable to grow in regions where other major crops cannot be grown. Wild relatives of many crops have played significant roles as genetic resources for crop improvement. Although there have been many studies of domesticated sorghum, few studies have reported on its wild relatives. In Sorghum , some species are widely distributed while others are very restricted. Of the 17 native sorghum species found in Australia, none have been cultivated. Isolation of these wild species from domesticated crops makes them a highly valuable system for studying the evolution of adaptive traits such as biotic and abiotic stress tolerance. The diversity of the genus Sorghum has probably arisen as a result of the extensive variability of the habitats over which they are distributed. The wild gene pool of sorghum may, therefore, harbor many useful genes for abiotic and biotic stress tolerance. While there are many examples of successful examples of introgression of novel alleles from the wild relatives of other species from Poaceae, such as rice, wheat, maize, and sugarcane, studies of introgression from wild sorghum are limited. An improved understanding of wild sorghums will better allow us to exploit this previously underutilized gene pool for the production of more resilient crops."

In this study, the instrumental role of the ZtRlm1 gene encoding a MADS-box transcription factor (TF) in the infection process of Z. tritici was functionally characterized as these proteins play critical roles in the global gene regulation required for various developmental and physiological processes. Our infection assays showed that ZtRlm1 mutants were attenuated in disease development as a 30 and 90% reduction in chloro-necrotic lesions and pycnidia formation, respectively, were observed in plants inoculated with ZtRlm1 mutant strains demonstrating that ZtRlm1 is a crucial factor playing a significant role in the late stage of infection corresponding with pycnidial formation. Our expression analysis demonstrated that the transcript level of ZtRlm1 is induced at 2 and 20 days post-inoculation, coinciding with pycnidial sporulation. In addition, microscopic analyses showed that branch intensity and biomass production were significantly reduced, indicating that impaired pycnidia formation is a result of impaired differentiation and biomass production in the ZtRlm1 mutants. Furthermore, melanization, a phenomenon required for fruiting body formation, was significantly hampered in ZtRlm1 mutants as they were not melanized under all tested temperature and media conditions. Overall, our data showed that impaired disease development of the ZtRlm1 mutants is mainly due to the significant impact of ZtRlm1 in different cellular processes, including differentiation, branching, fungal biomass production, and melanization, in which identification of downstream genes are of interest to increase our understanding of this pathosystem."

Recently, biochar (BC) has been used for remediation of Sb-contaminated soil, therefore, understanding the effect of BC-induced changes in soil microbial on the change of Sb speciation will help to elucidate the mechanism of BC in immobilization/mobilization of Sb in contaminated soils. Sb-contaminated soil with 10 wt % of Wheat straw-derived BC (SBC) and fruit (apple) tree-derived BC (FBC) and control was incubated for 130 days. Changes of soil bacterial community composition and Sb oxidation gene induced by BC were explored during the incubation. Dynamic change of Sb speciation was assessed by the citric acid extraction. The redundancy analysis (RDA) and spearman analysis (PCA) was used to analyze the relationship between Sb immobilization/mobilization and change of soil bacterial community induced by BC. The soil properties change induced by BC affected soil bacterial community composition, and Sb mobilization was strongly related to the change of soil bacterial community composition. The relative abundance of Sb oxidation gene increased in the soil amended by BC, which proved that oxidation of Sb(III) after 20 d incubation with SBC and 50 d incubation with FBC incubation. It is noteworthy that the application of BC has a potential mobilizing risk for Sb and both the change of soil bacteria and soil chemical properties play an important role in Sb mobilization. The possible risks induced by BC should be considered before applying the BC to Sb contaminated soil."

"32795581","abstracttext","The MYB transcription factors (TFs) comprise a major TF family in the plant kingdom. Studies increasingly show that MYB-related genes drive physiological functions in plants. However, little is known regarding their regulatory networks and downstream pathways in potato. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of MYB TFs and related proteins in potato (Solanum tuberosum, abbreviated as St), and identified 138 StMYB-related TFs that were phylogenetically classified into three distinct subgroups based on highly conserved gene structures, consensus motifs and protein domain architecture. Segmental duplication events were detected in the StMYB-related gene family by collinearity analysis, which likely contributed to the expansion of this family. Synteny analysis indicated that 41 StMYB-related genes were orthologous to Arabidopsis and 24 to wheat. In addition, RNA-seq analysis identified several tissue-specific and abiotic stress-responsive StMYB-related genes. To determine a potential role of these genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis and drought response, we analyzed the transcriptomes of the white, pigmented, drought-sensitive ('Atlantic') and drought-resistant ('Qingshu No.9') tetraploid potato cultivars from three flowering stages: early, peak (full blooms) and late (foliage falling). The interaction networks of StMYB-related proteins that were differentially expressed between pigmented versus white, as well as the drought-tolerant versus sensitive cultivars were also predicted. Our findings lay the foundation for prospective functional studies of potato StMYB-related TFs."

Many of the differentially expressed genes had no functional annotations. For those that did, analysis of the Gene Ontology (GO) terms showed that those related to metabolism were enriched in all three light treatments, while those related to growth and communication were more prevalent in the dark. Interestingly, genes for effectors that have been shown previously to be involved in pathogenicity also were upregulated in one or more of the light treatments, suggesting a possible role of light for infection."

High proportions of differentially expressed genes with no functional annotations illuminates the huge gap in our understanding of light responses in this fungus.

"33167324","abstracttext","In plant tissues, sugar levels are determined by the balance between sugar import, export, and sugar synthesis. So far, water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) dynamics have not been investigated in a diurnal context in wheat stems as compared to the dynamics in flag leaves during the terminal phases of grain filling. Here, we filled this research gap and tested the hypothesis that WSC dynamics interlink with gene expression of TaSUT1. The main stems and flag leaves of two genotypes, Westonia and Kauz, were sampled at four hourly intervals over a 24 h period at six developmental stages from heading to 28 DAA (days after anthesis). The total levels of WSC and WSC components were measured, and TaSUT1 gene expression was quantified at 21 DAA. On average, the total WSC and fructan levels in the stems were double those in the flag leaves. In both cultivars, diurnal patterns in the total WSC and sucrose were detected in leaves across all developmental stages, but not for the fructans 6-kestose and bifurcose. However, in stems, diurnal patterns of the total WSC and fructan were only found at anthesis in Kauz. The different levels of WSC and WSC components between Westonia and Kauz are likely associated with leaf chlorophyll levels and fructan degradation, especially 6-kestose degradation. High correlation between levels of TaSUT1 expression and sucrose in leaves indicated that TaSUT1 expression is likely to be influenced by the level of sucrose in leaves, and the combination of high levels of TaSUT1 expression and sucrose in Kauz may contribute to its high grain yield under well-watered conditions."
"33211369","articletitle","The complex genomic basis of rapid convergent adaptation to pesticides across continents in a fungal plant pathogen."
"33211369","abstracttext","Convergent evolution leads to identical phenotypic traits in different species or populations. Convergence can be driven by standing variation allowing selection to favor identical alleles in parallel or the same mutations can arise independently. However, the molecular basis of such convergent adaptation remains often poorly resolved. Pesticide resistance in agricultural ecosystems is a hallmark of convergence in phenotypic traits. Here, we analyze the major fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici causing serious losses on wheat and with fungicide resistance emergence across several continents. We sampled three population pairs each from a different continent spanning periods early and late in the application of fungicides. To identify causal loci for resistance, we combined knowledge from molecular genetics work and performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on a global set of isolates. We discovered yet unknown factors in azole resistance including a gene encoding membrane associated functions. We found strong support for the 'hotspot' model of resistance evolution with convergent changes in a small set of loci but additional loci showed more population-specific allele frequency changes. Genome-wide scans of selection showed that half of all known resistance loci were overlapping a selective sweep region. Hence, the application of fungicides was one of the major selective agents acting on the pathogen over the past decades. Furthermore, loci identified through GWAS showed the highest overlap with selective sweep regions underlining the importance to map phenotypic trait variation in evolving populations. Our population genomic analyses highlighted that both de novo mutations and gene flow contributed to convergent pesticide adaptation."

"7811964","abstracttext","The wheat basic-leucine zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding protein EmBP-1 has been implicated in the mechanisms of abscisic acid (ABA) mediated gene regulation. Sequence and structural homology to the yeast bZIP protein GCN4 has been used to predict the location of the functional domains of EmBP-1. In order to test these predictions, the presumptive DNA-binding and dimerization domains of EmBP-1 were mapped by producing a series of truncated protein fragments and functionally testing them in vitro. Deletion of 5 amino acids of the predicted basic domain resulted in a loss of all DNA-binding activity. A fragment containing all six leucine repeat elements showed strong DNA-binding activity. Sequential deletion of the leucine repeat elements resulted in first an increase in DNA-binding activity (-L6 and -L5) followed by a reduction in binding activity (-L4) and eventually complete elimination of all detectable DNA-binding activity (-L3 and -L2). This demonstrates the importance of an intact leucine zipper domain of at least 4 repeat elements for efficient DNA-binding. The smallest polypeptide that retained DNA-binding activity is a fragment spanning amino acid residues 248-308 (ca. 8.4 kDa) consisting of minimal basic and leucine zipper domains. Dimerization of EmBP-1 was demonstrated by co-translation of fragments of differing molecular weights and identification of a DNA-protein complex with intermediate mobility to that produced by each fragment alone. A unique leucine-proline repeat element found N-terminal to the DNA-binding domain of EmBP-1 does not appear to play a role in DNA-binding or dimerization. These results confirm the locations of the functional domains of EmBP-1 predicted by similarity to GCN4. The high degree of functional conservation of the bZIP proteins spanning organisms from plants to fungi highlights the ancient origin of this class of transcription factors and of the mechanisms of gene regulation in which they participate."

"7717969","abstracttext","A genomic library of Clostridium thermocellum DNA constructed in lambda ZAPII was screened for xylanase-expressing clones. Cross-hybridization experiments revealed a new xylanase gene isolated from the gene library, which was designated xyn Y. The encoded enzyme, xylanase Y (XYLY), displayed features characteristic of an endo-beta1,4-xylanase: the enzyme rapidly hydrolysed oat spelt, wheat and rye arabinoxylans and was active against methyl-umbelliferyl-beta-D-cellobioside, but did not hydrolyse any cellulosic substrates. The pH and temperature optima of the enzyme were 6.8 and 75 degrees C respectively, and the recombinant XYLY, expressed by Escherichia coli had a maximum Mr of 116000. The nucleotide sequence of xyn Y contained an open reading frame of 3228 bp encoding a protein of predicted Mr 120 105. The encoded enzyme contained a typical N-terminal 26-residue signal peptide, followed by a 164 amino acid sequence, designated domain A, that was not essential for catalytic activity. Downstream of domain A was a 351-residue xylanase Family F catalytic domain, followed by a 180-residue sequence that exhibited 28% sequence identity with a thermostable domain of Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum xylanase A. The C-terminal portion of XYLY comprised the 23-residue duplicated docking sequence found in all other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases that are constituents of the bacterium's multienzyme complex, termed the cellulosome, followed by a 286-residue domain which exhibited 32% sequence identity with the N-terminal region of C. thermocellum xylanase Z. The enzyme did not contain linker sequences found in other C. thermocellum plant cell wall hydrolases. Analysis of truncated forms of XYLY and hybrid proteins, comprising segments of XYLY fused to the E. coli maltose binding domain, confirmed that XYLY contained a central catalytic domain and an adjacent thermostable domain. The C-terminal domain did not bind to cellulose or xylan. Western blot analysis using antiserum raised against XYLY showed that the xylanase was located in the cellulosome and did not appear to be extensively glycosylated. The non-catalytic domains of XYLY are discussed in relation to the general stability of thermophilic xylanases."

"17248646","abstracttext","The inheritance of vernalization response was studied in crosses involving four spring wheats (Sonora 64 (S), Pitic 62 (P), Justin (J) and Thatcher (T)) and three winter wheats (Blackhull (B), Early Blackhull (E) and Extra Early Blackhull (EE)).-All winter cultivars were highly responsive to vernalization, and Pitic 62 was the only spring cultivar whose time to heading was significantly accelerated following cold treatments. When vernalized and grown under long days, spring and winter cultivars became comparable in their heading response, indicating that cold requirement is the major attribute differentiating the heading behavior of true spring and true winter wheats.-Inheritance of growth habit in the F(1) generation of a five-parent diallel cross showed dominance of the spring character in all spring x winter crosses. Depending on the cross, one or two duplicate major genes governing growth habit were detected in F(2), F(3) and backcross generations grown in the field under long days in the absence of vernalizing temperatures. In some spring x winter crosses most of the variation in heading time among spring segregates could be attributed to the effects of major genes conditioning growth habit. In other crosses the heading patterns appeared more complex, indicating that genes with smaller effects are also involved in the control of heading response under spring or summer environments.-Evidence was presented supporting the hypothesis that the cultivar Pitic 62 carries a different allele at one of the two major loci governing its spring habit. This allele was associated with some response to vernalization and acted as a dominant gene determining earliness under low temperature vernalization, but as a partially recessive gene determining lateness in the absence of vernalizing temperatures. Genotypes were assigned to five cultivars as follows: S, CC DD; P, CC D'D'; J, cc DD; B and EE, cc dd.-The presence of major and minor genes and of multiple alleles governing response to photoperiod and vernalization was discussed in relation to the genetic manipulation of the heading response and to breeding wheat cultivars with specific or broad adaptation."

"17177781","abstracttext","Transgenic oilseed rape (Brassica napus) plants may remain as 'volunteer' weeds in following crops, complicating cultivation and contaminating crop yield. Volunteers can become feral as well as act as a genetic bridge for the transfer of transgenes to weedy relatives. Transgenic mitigation using genes that are positive or neutral to the crop, but deleterious to weeds, should prevent volunteer establishment, as previously intimated using a tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) model. A transgenically mitigated (TM), dwarf, herbicide-resistant construct using a gibberellic acid-insensitive (Deltagai) gene in the B. napus crop was effective in offsetting the risks of transgene establishment in volunteer populations of B. napus. This may be useful in the absence of herbicide, e.g. when wheat is rotated with oilseed rape. The TM dwarf B. napus plants grown alone had a much higher yield than the non-transgenics, but were exceedingly unfit in competition with non-transgenic tall cohorts. The reproductive fitness of TM B. napus was 0% at 2.5-cm and 4% at 5-cm spacing between glasshouse-grown plants relative to non-transgenic B. napus. Under screen-house conditions, the reproductive fitness of TM B. napus relative to non-transgenic B. napus was less than 12%, and the harvest index of the TM plants was less than 40% of that of the non-transgenic competitors. The data clearly indicate that the Deltagai gene greatly enhances the yield in a weed-free transgenic crop, but the dwarf plants can be eliminated when competing with non-transgenic cohorts (and presumably other species) when the selective herbicide is not used."

"17294164","abstracttext","Successful plant establishment is critical to the development of high-yielding crops. Short coleoptiles can reduce seedling emergence particularly when seed is sown deep as occurs when moisture necessary for germination is deep in the subsoil. Detailed molecular maps for a range of wheat doubled-haploid populations (Cranbrook/Halberd, Sunco/Tasman, CD87/Katepwa and Kukri/Janz) were used to identify genomic regions affecting coleoptile characteristics length, cross-sectional area and degree of spiralling across contrasting soil temperatures. Genotypic variation was large and distributions of genotype means were approximately normal with evidence for transgressive segregation. Narrow-sense heritabilities were high for coleoptile length and cross-sectional area indicating a strong genetic basis for differences among progeny. In contrast, heritabilities for coleoptile spiralling were small. Molecular marker analyses identified a number of significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for coleoptile growth. Many of the coleoptile growth QTL mapped directly to the Rht-B1 or Rht-D1 dwarfing gene loci conferring reduced cell size through insensitivity to endogenous gibberellins. Other QTL for coleoptile growth were identified throughout the genome. Epistatic interactions were small or non-existent, and there was little evidence for any QTL x temperature interaction. Gene effects at significant QTL were approximately one-half to one-quarter the size of effects at the Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 regions. However, selection at these QTL could together alter coleoptile length by up to 50 mm. In addition to Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b, genomic regions on chromosomes 2B, 2D, 4A, 5D and 6B were repeatable across two or more populations suggesting their potential value for use in breeding and marker-aided selection for greater coleoptile length and improved establishment."

"17067373","abstracttext_background","During the past decade, Sanger sequencing has been used to completely sequence hundreds of microbial and a few higher eukaryote genomes. In recent years, a number of alternative technologies became available, among them adaptations of the pyrosequencing procedure (i.e. ""454 sequencing""), promising an approximately 100-fold increase in throughput over Sanger technology--an advancement which is needed to make large and complex genomes more amenable to full genome sequencing at affordable costs. Although several studies have demonstrated its potential usefulness for sequencing small and compact microbial genomes, it was unclear how the new technology would perform in large and highly repetitive genomes such as those of wheat or barley."
"17067373","abstracttext_results","To study its performance in complex genomes, we used 454 technology to sequence four barley Bacterial Artificial Chromosome (BAC) clones and compared the results to those from ABI-Sanger sequencing. All gene containing regions were covered efficiently and at high quality with 454 sequencing whereas repetitive sequences were more problematic with 454 sequencing than with ABI-Sanger sequencing. 454 sequencing provided a much more even coverage of the BAC clones than ABI-Sanger sequencing, resulting in almost complete assembly of all genic sequences even at only 9 to 10-fold coverage. To obtain highly advanced working draft sequences for the BACs, we developed a strategy to assemble large parts of the BAC sequences by combining comparative genomics, detailed repeat analysis and use of low-quality reads from 454 sequencing. Additionally, we describe an approach of including small numbers of ABI-Sanger sequences to produce hybrid assemblies to partly compensate the short read length of 454 sequences."
"17067373","abstracttext_conclusion","Our data indicate that 454 pyrosequencing allows rapid and cost-effective sequencing of the gene-containing portions of large and complex genomes and that its combination with ABI-Sanger sequencing and targeted sequence analysis can result in large regions of high-quality finished genomic sequences."

"16979329","abstracttext","Macronutrient composition of diets can influence body-weight development and energy balance. We studied the short-term effects of high-protein (HP) and/or high-fat (HF) diets on energy expenditure (EE) and uncoupling protein (UCP1-3) gene expression. Adult male rats were fed ad libitum with diets containing different protein-fat ratios: adequate protein-normal fat (AP-NF): 20% casein, 5% fat; adequate protein-high fat (AP-HF): 20% casein, 17% fat; high protein-normal fat (HP-NF): 60% casein, 5% fat; high protein-high fat (HP-HF): 60% casein, 17% fat. Wheat starch was used for adjustment of energy content. After 4 days, overnight EE and oxygen consumption, as measured by indirect calorimetry, were higher and body-weight gain was lower in rats fed with HP diets as compared with rats fed diets with adequate protein content (P<.05). Exchanging carbohydrates by protein increased fat oxidation in HF diet fed groups. The UCP1 mRNA expression in brown adipose tissue was not significantly different in HP diet fed groups as compared with AP diet fed groups. Expression of different homologues of UCPs positively correlated with nighttime oxygen consumption and EE. Moreover, dietary protein and fat distinctly influenced liver UCP2 and skeletal muscle UCP3 mRNA expressions. These findings demonstrated that a 4-day ad libitum high dietary protein exposure influences energy balance in rats. A function of UCPs in energy balance and dissipating food energy was suggested. Future experiments are focused on the regulation of UCP gene expression by dietary protein, which could be important for body-weight management."

"32774456","abstracttext_background","Lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) are often studied in simple models involving activity measurements of a single LPMO or a blend thereof with hydrolytic enzymes towards an insoluble substrate. However, the contribution of LPMOs to polysaccharide breakdown in complex cocktails of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes, similar to fungal secretomes, remains elusive. Typically, two starch-specific AA13 LPMOs are encoded by mainly Ascomycota genomes. Here, we investigate the impact of LPMO loss on the growth and degradation of starches of varying resistance to amylolytic hydrolases by Aspergillus nidulans ."
"32774456","abstracttext_results","Deletion of the genes encoding An AA13A that possesses a CBM20 starch-binding module, An AA13B (lacking a CBM20) or both AA13 genes resulted in reduced growth on solid media with resistant, but not soluble processed potato starch. Larger size and amount of residual starch granules were observed for the AA13-deficient strains as compared to the reference and the impairment of starch degradation was more severe for the strain lacking An AA13A based on a microscopic analysis. After 5 days of growth on raw potato starch in liquid media, the mount of residual starch was about fivefold higher for the AA13 gene deletion strains compared to the reference, which underscores the importance of LPMOs for degradation of especially resistant starches. Proteomic analyses revealed substantial changes in the secretomes of the double AA13 gene deletion, followed by the An AA13A-deficient strain, whereas only a single protein was significantly different in the proteome of the An AA13B-deficient strain as compared to the reference."
"32774456","abstracttext_conclusions","This study shows that the loss of AA13, especially the starch-binding An AA13A, impairs degradation of resistant potato starch, but has limited impact on less-resistant wheat starch and no impact on processed solubilized starch. The effects of LPMO loss are more pronounced at the later stages of fungal growth, likely due to the accumulation of the less-accessible regions of the substrate. The striking impairment in granular starch degradation due to the loss of a single LPMO from the secretome offers insight into the crucial role played by AA13 in the breakdown of resistant starch and presents a methodological framework to analyse the contribution of distinct LPMOs towards semi-crystalline polysaccharides under in vivo conditions."

"26874412","abstracttext","Our objective was to evaluate the effects of dietary starch content, altered by partial substitution of dietary grain with wheat dried distillers grain with solubles (DDGS), on the interval from calving to first ovulation, concentrations of hormones and metabolites in plasma and follicular fluid, and granulosa cell gene expression in preovulatory follicles. Sixty lactating dairy cows were assigned to 1 of 2 diets from calving until 84d postpartum. Diets were formulated to contain either 17.3% rolled barley grain (29.2% starch) or 17.2% wheat DDGS (19.1% starch), with 43.0% barley silage and 21.6% rolled corn grain as the other major ingredients (dry matter basis). Transrectal ultrasonography was performed twice weekly to monitor ovarian dynamics from 7 ± 2d postpartum until ovulation or until 56d in milk, whichever occurred earlier. Plasma concentrations of insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were determined in all 60 cows, and that of glucose, fatty acids, and urea in a subset of 24 cows, representing those in which the first ovulation occurred spontaneously within 5 wk postpartum. Estradiol (proestrus) and progesterone (12d postovulation) in plasma were also measured. Concentrations of insulin, IGF-1, glucose, fatty acids, and urea were determined in follicular fluid (wk 9), and the expression of LH receptor, estrogen receptor β, cytochrome P450 aromatase, and plasma type glutathione peroxidase genes measured in granulosa cells obtained from the preovulatory follicles at wk 9 postpartum in the subset of 24 cows. Diets did not alter the interval from calving to first ovulation (32.3 ± 2.5d), but a significantly lower proportion of cows on the DDGS diet (20%) ovulated multiple (≥ 2) follicles at the first ovulation than those on the barley grain diet (40%). The incidence of multiple ovulations tended to be lower at first insemination (10 vs. 21% for cows fed DDGS and barley grain diets, respectively). Mean plasma concentration of insulin was higher in cows fed the barley grain diet (2.5 vs 1.6 IU/mL), and a diet by time interaction was noted, with cows on the barley grain ration having higher insulin from wk 6 to 12 postpartum; however, mean plasma IGF-1 concentration did not differ between dietary groups. In the subsets, mean plasma concentrations of metabolites or estradiol and progesterone were not affected by diet, parity, or diet by parity interactions. Cows on the DDGS diet had lower concentrations of IGF-I (69 vs. 108 ng/mL) and higher fatty acids (222 vs. 149 mEq/L) in the follicular fluid obtained from preovulatory follicles. Diet, parity, and diet by parity interactions did not affect the concentrations of insulin, glucose, urea, estradiol, and progesterone in follicular fluid. Diets did not alter the expression profiles of LHr, estrogen receptor β, CYP19, and GPx3 genes in granulosa cells. In summary, diets did not affect the interval from calving to first ovulation or granulosa cell gene expression. However, reducing dietary starch content by a partial replacement of dietary grain with wheat DDGS increased fatty acids in follicular fluid and reduced the concentrations of insulin in plasma, IGF-1 in follicular fluid, and the incidence of multiple ovulations."

"2243383","abstracttext","A 25-kDa vaccinia virus (VV) virion protein, designated M25, is modified in vivo by covalent addition of myristic acid. The predicted amino acid sequences of all VV open reading frames which have been reported were searched for the sequence M-G-X-X-X-(S/T/A), which has been proposed to be the consensus recognition signal for cotranslational modification of proteins by N-myristyltransferase. This conserved signal was found at the amino terminus of a single locus, which corresponded to the leftmost rightward-reading open reading frame (L1R) initiating within the VV HindIII L DNA fragment. By using synthetic oligonucleotides in concert with polymerase chain reaction techniques, a chimeric gene consisting of open reading fram L1R fused to a bacteriophage T7 promoter was constructed and cloned into a plasmid vector. Transcripts derived from the wild-type expression plasmid (designated pL1G1) were translated in vitro in a wheat germ extract to yield a polypeptide with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa. This polypeptide was labeled with either [35S]methionine or [3H]myristic acid and comigrated with in vivo-labeled protein M25 on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Polyclonal antiserum generated in rabbits against a trpE:L1R fusion protein immunoprecipitated a 25-kDa protein labeled either in vitro (the L1R gene product, designated protein L1) or in vivo (from purified VV, protein M25), identifying the M25 protein as the gene product of open reading frame L1R. Chromatographic analysis of the protein L1-bound fatty acid moieties liberated after acid methanolysis resulted in recovery of greater than 99% of the fatty acid as myristate-associated label. Cell-free translation of proteins derived from a set of deletions from the carboxy terminus of the open reading frame L1R suggested that the site of myristylation maps near the amino terminus of protein L1. This hypothesis was supported by cell-free translation of mutant L1R transcripts in which the penultimate glycine codon had been altered by site-directed mutagenesis to encode either an aspartic acid (pL1D1) or alanine (pL1A1) residue. In both cases, the mutant transcripts were translated into a 25-kDa protein which could be labeled in vitro with [35S]methionine but not with [3H]myristic acid. These data demonstrate that VV open reading frame L1R encodes a myristylated protein and provide evidence that the site of modification of protein L1 is the amino-terminal glycine residue."
"8607266","articletitle","Expression of the barley stripe mosaic virus RNA beta ""triple gene block""."
"8607266","abstracttext","Genomic RNA beta of barley strip mosaic virus (BSMV) contains four defined open reading frames (ORFs). These include the coat protein (beta a) and a ""triple gene block"" consisting of the beta b, beta c, and beta d ORFs that overlap one another. Two subgenomic beta RNAs (sgRNA beta 1 and sgRNA beta 2) with sizes of 2.5 and 0.96 kb were identified in BSMV-infected protoplasts, and their transcription initiation sites were mapped to nucleotides 789 and 2327, respectively, of RNA beta by primer extension experiments. In a cell-free wheat germ translation system, genomic RNA beta served as a mRNA only for the 22-kDa coat protein, and sgRNA beta 1 directed synthesis of only the 58-kDA beta b protein. However, with sgRNA beta 2, three proteins with sizes of 14, 17, and 23 kDa were synthesized. Both the 14- and the 23-kDa proteins were recognized by the beta d antibodies in vitro and in vivo. These results demonstrated that the 14-kDa protein was encoded by the beta d ORF and suggested that the 23-kDa protein, designated beta d', is a readthrough product of the amber stop codon of the beta d ORF. Mutagenesis of sgRNA beta 2 revealed that the 17-kDa protein was a product of the beta c ORF. Expression of sgRNA beta 1 and sgRNA beta 2 was also investigated with the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene in protoplasts coinfected with RNAs alpha and gamma plus chimeric RNA beta derivatives containing the CAT gene in-frame with the beta b, beta c, beta d, or beta d' ORFs. Elimination of the sgRNA beta 1 promoter abolished CAT expression from the beta b-CAT chimeric RNA, and removal of the sgRNA beta 2 promoter prevented CAT expression from the beta c-CAT, beta d-CAT, and beta d'-CAT chimeric RNAs. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the BSMV coat protein is the sole translation product of the genomic RNA beta, whereas sgRNA beta 1 serves as a messenger for translation of the beta b protein, and sgRNA beta 2 functions as a messenger for translation of beta c and beta d and the newly discovered beta d' protein. Additional mutagenesis experiments indicate that beta c is translated by a leaky scanning mechanism."

We have used primary (SW 480, HT 29) and metastatic (SW 620) human colorectal cancer cell lines and a transfectant, genetically engineered SW 620 cell line with mouse gene Thy-1.2 (SW 620/T) to test the possibility of marking human cancer with xenogeneic mouse gene and use it for effective site-specific targeting. The targeting moieties and doxorubicin were conjugated to a water-soluble copolymer based on N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) acting as a carrier responsible for controlled intracellular release of the targeted drug. FACS analysis showed a strong binding of WGA-FITC to all tested cell lines. Binding of PNA-FITC was considerably weaker. The in vitro antiproliferative effect of lectin-targeted HPMA carrier-bound doxorubicin evaluated as [(3)H]TdR incorporation reflected both the intensity of the binding and the different sensitivity of the tested cancer cells lines to doxorubicin. The antiproliferative effect of conjugates targeted with WGA was comparable to that with the conjugates targeted with the anti-Thy-1.2 monoclonal antibody or their F(ab')(2) fragments. The magnitude of the cytotoxic effect of HPMA-doxorubicin targeted with PNA was lower in all tested cell lines. While the conjugates with WGA were more cytotoxic, the conjugates with PNA were more specific as their binding is limited to cancer cells and to the sites of inflammation. Noncytotoxic conjugates with a very low concentration of doxorubicin and targeted with PNA, anti-Thy-1.2, or their F(ab')(2) fragments exerted in some lines (SW 480, SW 620) low mitogenic activity. The Thy-1.2 gene-transfected SW 620 metastatic colorectal cancer cell line was sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of Thy-1.2-targeted doxorubicin as was shown for the Thy-1. 2(+) EL4 cell line and for Thy-1.2(+) concanavalin A-stimulated mouse T lymphocytes. These results represent the first indication of the suitability of transfection of human cancer cells with selected targeting genes for site-specific therapy of malignancies."

Under the Mediterranean low rainfall environments of Australia, annual Medicago pasture legumes are used in rotation with cereals to fix atmospheric nitrogen and improve soil parameters. Considerable efforts are being made in breeding programs to improve resistance and tolerance to Pratylenchus neglectus in the major crops wheat and barley, which makes it vital to develop appropriate selection tools in medics."
"24742262","abstracttext_results","A strong source of tolerance to root damage by the root lesion nematode (RLN) Pratylenchus neglectus had previously been identified in line RH-1 (strand medic, M. littoralis). Using RH-1, we have developed a single seed descent (SSD) population of 138 lines by crossing it to the intolerant cultivar Herald. After inoculation, RLN-associated root damage clearly segregated in the population. Genetic analysis was performed by constructing a genetic map using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and gene-based SNP markers. A highly significant quantitative trait locus (QTL), QPnTolMl.1, was identified explaining 49% of the phenotypic variation in the SSD population. All SSRs and gene-based markers in the QTL region were derived from chromosome 1 of the sequenced genome of the closely related species M. truncatula. Gene-based markers were validated in advanced breeding lines derived from the RH-1 parent and also a second RLN tolerance source, RH-2 (M. truncatula ssp. tricycla). Comparative analysis to sequenced legume genomes showed that the physical QTL interval exists as a synteny block in Lotus japonicus, common bean, soybean and chickpea. Furthermore, using the sequenced genome information of M. truncatula, the QTL interval contains 55 genes out of which five are discussed as potential candidate genes responsible for the mapped tolerance."

"26440330","abstracttext","Previous research indicates that metabolism and fiber type of skeletal muscle is related to intramuscular lipid content. It is hypothesized that changes in skeletal muscle gene expression influence adipose tissue development. The objective of this study was to determine differences in the metabolism and intercellular signaling of skeletal muscle fibers within the same muscle group that could be responsible for the initiation of intramuscular adipose tissue development and differentiation. Longissimus dorsi muscle samples were collected from steers ( = 12; 385 d of age; 378 kg BW) grazing wheat pasture. Longissimus muscle samples were dissected under magnification and sorted into 3 categories based on visual stage of adipose tissue development: immature intramuscular adipose tissue (MM), intermediate intramuscular adipose tissue (ME), and mature intramuscular adipose tissue (MA). Additionally, muscle fibers lying adjacent to each intramuscular adipose tissue (IM) category and those not associated with IM tissue were collected and stored separately. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine relative fold change in genes involved in metabolism, angiogenesis, formation of extracellular matrix, and intercellular signaling pathways in both LM and IM samples. Gene expression data were analyzed using a GLM that included the fixed effect of tissue. Pearson correlation coefficients were also computed between gene expression in LM and IM tissue samples that were at the same stage of development. and γ mRNA expression were 3.56- and 1.97-fold greater ( < 0.05) in ME and MA IM compared with MM IM whereas mRNA expression was 1.43-fold less ( < 0.01) in MA IM compared with MM IM, indicating successful separation into different development categories. Genes associated with metabolism and angiogenesis in LM tissue showed no differences among stages of development. Myostatin expression did not change in LM tissue; however, expression of and mRNA decreased ( < 0.01) as IM matured. and mRNA expression were 2.5- and 1.32-fold greater in LM associated with MM IM than in LM associated with ME IM. Angiogenic growth factors in MM IM tissue had a strong positive correlation ( ≥ 0.69) with angiogenic growth factors in LM associated with MM IM; however, no correlation was observed in ME or MA IM.

Recently, a F. graminearum strain collected from Minnesota (MN) was determined to produce a novel trichothecene toxin, called NX-2. In order to determine the spatial and temporal dynamics of NX-2 producing strains in MN, North Dakota (ND) and South Dakota (SD), a total of 463 F. graminearum strains were collected from three sampling periods, 1999-2000, 2006-2007 and 2011-2013. A PCR-RFLP based diagnostic test was developed and validated for NX-2 producing strains based on polymorphisms in the Tri1 gene. Trichothecene biosynthesis gene (Tri gene)-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and ten PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) markers were used to genotype all strains. NX-2 strains were detected in each sampling period but with a very low overall frequency (2.8%) and were mainly collected near the borders of MN, ND and SD. Strains with the 3ADON chemotype were relatively infrequent in 1999-2000 (4.5%) but increased to 29.4% in 2006-2007 and 17.2% in 2011-2013. The distribution of 3ADON producing strains also expanded from a few border counties between ND and MN in 1999-2000, southward toward the border between SD and MN in 2006-2007 and westward in 2011-2013. Genetic differentiation between 2006-2007 and 2011-2013 populations (3%) was much lower than that between 1999-2000 and 2006-2007 (22%) or 1999-2000 and 2011-2013 (20%) suggesting that most change to population genetic structure of F. graminearum occurred between 1999-2000 and 2006-2007. This change was associated with the emergence of a new population consisting largely of individuals with a 3ADON chemotype. A Bayesian clustering analysis suggested that NX-2 chemotype strains are part of a previously described Upper Midwestern population. However, these analyses also suggest that the NX-2 isolates could represent a distinct population, but that interpretations of population assignment are influenced by the small number of NX-2 strains available for analysis."

"30253736","abstracttext_background","Powdery mildew (PM) is one of the most important and widespread plant diseases caused by biotrophic fungi. Notably, while monocot (grass) PM fungi exhibit high-level of host-specialization, many dicot PM fungi display a broad host range. To understand such distinct modes of host-adaptation, we sequenced the genomes of four dicot PM biotypes belonging to Golovinomyces cichoracearum or Oidium neolycopersici."
"30253736","abstracttext_results","We compared genomes of the four dicot PM together with those of Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei (both DH14 and RACE1 isolates), B. graminis f.sp. tritici, and Erysiphe necator infectious on barley, wheat and grapevine, respectively. We found that despite having a similar gene number (6620-6961), the PM genomes vary from 120 to 222 Mb in size. This high-level of genome size variation is indicative of highly differential transposon activities in the PM genomes. While the total number of genes in any given PM genome is only about half of that in the genomes of closely related ascomycete fungi, most (~ 93%) of the ascomycete core genes (ACGs) can be found in the PM genomes. Yet, 186 ACGs were found absent in at least two of the eight PM genomes, of which 35 are missing in some dicot PM biotypes, but present in the three monocot PM genomes, indicating remarkable, independent and perhaps ongoing gene loss in different PM lineages. Consistent with this, we found that only 4192 (3819 singleton) genes are shared by all the eight PM genomes, the remaining genes are lineage- or biotype-specific. Strikingly, whereas the three monocot PM genomes possess up to 661 genes encoding candidate secreted effector proteins (CSEPs) with families containing up to 38 members, all the five dicot PM fungi have only 116-175 genes encoding CSEPs with limited gene amplification."
"30253736","abstracttext_conclusions","Compared to monocot (grass) PM fungi, dicot PM fungi have a much smaller effectorome. This is consistent with their contrasting modes of host-adaption: while the monocot PM fungi show a high-level of host specialization, which may reflect an advanced host-pathogen arms race, the dicot PM fungi tend to practice polyphagy, which might have lessened selective pressure for escalating an with a particular host."

"30813902","abstracttext_background","Anthocyanins are plants secondary metabolites important for plant adaptation to severe environments and potentially beneficial to human health. Purple colour of barley grain is caused by the pigments synthesized in pericarp. One or two genes determine the trait. One of them is Ant2 mapped on chromosome 2HL and is known to encode transcription factor (TF) with a bHLH domain. In plants, bHLH regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis together with TF harboring an R2R3-MYB domain. In wheat, the R2R3-MYBs responsible for purple colour of grain pericarp are encoded by the homoallelic series of the Pp-1 genes that were mapped on the short arms of chromosomes 7. In barley, in orthologous positions to wheat's Pp-1, the Ant1 gene determining red colour of leaf sheath has been mapped. In the current study, we tested whether Ant1 has pleiotropic effect not only on leaf sheath colour but also on pericarp pigmentation."
"30813902","abstracttext_results","А set of near isogenic lines (NILs) carrying different combinations of alleles at the Ant1 and Ant2 loci was created using markers-assisted backcrossing approach. The dominant alleles of both the Ant1 and Ant2 genes are required for anthocyanin accumulation in pericarp. A qRT-PCR analysis of the Ant genes in lemma and pericarp of the NILs revealed that some reciprocal interaction occurs between the genes. Expression of each of the two genes was up-regulated in purple-grained line with dominant alleles at the both loci. The lines carrying dominant allele either in the Ant1 or in the Ant2 locus were characterized by the decreased level of expression of the dominant gene and scant activity of the recessive one. The Ant1 and Ant2 expression was barely detected in uncolored line with recessive alleles at both loci. The anthocyanin biosynthesis structural genes were differently regulated: Chs, Chi, F3h, Dfr were transcribed in all lines independently on allelic state of the Ant1 and Ant2 genes, whereas F3'h and Ans were activated in presence on dominant alleles of the both regulatory genes."
"30813902","abstracttext_conclusions","The R2R3-MYB-encoding counterpart (Ant1) of the regulatory Ant2 gene was determined for the first time. The dominant alleles of both of them are required for activation of anthocyanin synthesis in barley lemma and pericarp. The R2R3-MYB + bHLH complex activates the synthesis via affecting expression of the F3'h and Ans structural genes. In addition, positive regulatory loop between Ant1 and Ant2 was detected. Earlier the interaction between the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulatory genes has been revealed in dicot plant species only. Our data demonstrated that the regulatory mechanism is considered to be more common for plant kingdom than it has been reported so far."
"31708948","articletitle","Further Elucidation of the Argonaute and Dicer Protein Families in the Model Grass Species Brachypodium distachyon ."
"31708948","abstracttext","RNA interference (RNAi) is a biological process in which small RNAs regulate gene silencing at the transcriptional or posttranscriptional level. The trigger for gene silencing is double-stranded RNA generated from an endogenous genomic locus or a foreign source, such as a transgene or virus. In addition to regulating endogenous gene expression, RNAi provides the mechanistic basis for small RNA-mediated communication between plant hosts and interacting pathogenic microbes, known as cross-kingdom RNAi. Two core protein components, Argonaute (AGO) and Dicer (DCL), are central to the RNAi machinery of eukaryotes. Plants encode for several copies of AGO and DCL genes; in Arabidopsis thaliana , the AGO protein family contains 10 members, and the DCL family contains four. Little is known about the conservation and specific roles of these proteins in monocotyledonous plants, which account for the most important food staples. Here, we utilized in silico tools to investigate the structure and related functions of AGO and DCL proteins from the model grass Brachypodium distachyon . Based on the presence of characteristic domains, 16 BdAGO- and 6 BdDCL-predicted proteins were identified. Phylogenetic analysis showed that both protein families were expanded in Brachypodium as compared with Arabidopsis . For BdDCL proteins, both plant species contain a single copy of DCL1 and DCL4; however, Brachypodium contains two copies each of DCL2 and DCL3. Members of the BdAGO family were placed in all three functional clades of AGO proteins previously described in Arabidopsis . The greatest expansion occurred in the AtAGO1/5/10 clade, which contains nine BdAGOs (BdAGO5/6/7/9/10/11/12/15/16). The catalytic tetrad of the AGO P-element-induced wimpy testis domain (PIWI), which is required for endonuclease activity, is conserved in most BdAGOs, with the exception of BdAGO1, which lacks the last D/H residue. Three-dimensional modeling of BdAGO proteins using tertiary structure prediction software supported the phylogenetic classification. We also predicted a provisional interactome network for BdAGOs, their localization within the cell, and organ/tissue-specific expression. Exploring the specifics of RNAi machinery proteins in a model grass species can serve as a proxy for agronomically important cereals such as barley and wheat, where the development of RNAi-based plant protection strategies is of great interest."

"31604764","abstracttext","Transcriptional regulation of cellulolytic and xylolytic genes in ascomycete fungi is controlled by specific carbon sources in different external environments. Here, comparative transcriptomic analyses of Penicillium oxalicum grown on wheat bran (WB), WB plus rice straw (WR), or WB plus Avicel (WA) as the sole carbon source under solid-state fermentation (SSF) revealed that most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were involved in metabolism, specifically, carbohydrate metabolism. Of the DEGs, the basic core carbohydrate-active enzyme-encoding genes which responded to the plant biomass resources were identified in P. oxalicum , and their transcriptional levels changed to various extents depending on the different carbon sources. Moreover, this study found that three deletion mutants of genes encoding putative transcription factors showed significant alterations in filter paper cellulase production compared with that of a parental P. oxalicum strain with a deletion of Ku70 (Δ PoxKu70 strain) when grown on WR under SSF. Importantly, the Δ PoxAtf1 mutant (with a deletion of P. oxalicum Atf1 , also called POX03016 ) displayed 46.1 to 183.2% more cellulase and xylanase production than a Δ PoxKu70 mutant after 2 days of growth on WR. RNA sequencing and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed that PoxAtf1 dynamically regulated the expression of major cellulase and xylanase genes under SSF. PoxAtf1 bound to the promoter regions of the key cellulase and xylanase genes in vitro This study provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism of fungal cellulase and xylanase gene expression under SSF. IMPORTANCE The transition to a more environmentally friendly economy encourages studies involving the high-value-added utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. Solid-state fermentation (SSF), that simulates the natural habitat of soil microorganisms, is used for a variety of applications such as biomass biorefinery. Prior to the current study, our understanding of genome-wide gene expression and of the regulation of gene expression of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes in ascomycete fungi during SSF was limited. Here, we employed RNA sequencing and genetic analyses to investigate transcriptomes of Penicillium oxalicum strain EU2101 cultured on medium containing different carbon sources and to identify and characterize transcription factors for regulating the expression of cellulase and xylanase genes during SSF. The results generated will provide novel insights into genetic engineering of filamentous fungi to further increase enzyme production."
"30764455","articletitle","First Report of Barley yellow dwarf virus-PAS in Wheat and Barley Grown in the Czech Republic."
"30764455","abstracttext","Barley yellow dwarf disease, an important, ubiquitous virus disease of cereal crops worldwide, is caused by a group of related single-stranded RNA viruses assigned to luteovirus (Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) spp. PAV, PAS, MAV, and GAV) or polerovirus (Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV) genera or unassigned to a genera (BYDV-SGV, BYDV-RMV, and BYDV-GPV) in the family Luteoviridae (2). Incidence of BYDV in cereal crops (e.g., barley, wheat, and oats) was high and reached epidemic levels in recent years in many regions of the Czech Republic. Previously, only PAV isolates have been identified here on the basis of serological detection (4), although antibodies to differentiate between PAV, PAS, and MAV are not widely available. Field samples of cereal crops were routinely tested in 2006 and 2007 and BYDVs were detected by ELISA. One-step-reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was adapted for BYDV detection using primer pairs BYcpF (5'-CCACTAGAGAGGTGGTGAATG-3') and BYcpR (5'-CCGGTGTTGAGGAGTCTACC-3') designed from conserved sequences identified by aligning multiple BYDV sequences available in public databases. These primers amplify a 641-bp fragment spanning nucleotides 2839-3479 from PAV (GenBank Accession No. EF043235) or PAS (GenBank Accession No. NC_002160) that includes a region of the coat protein gene and the intergenic region. RT-PCR amplicons were generated from two field isolates, PS-RuJK (spring wheat isolate, cv. Granny, collected in July 2007 from experimental plots at the CRI in Prague) and JE-120JK (winter barley isolate, cv. Merlot, collected in January 2008 from a barley field in Rychnov), both of which induced severe BYD symptoms. Amplicons were sequenced in both directions in a CEQ2000XL sequencer (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). The partial coat protein gene sequence of 483 nt of PS-RuJK and JE-120JK was analyzed and compared with available sequences of 26 PAV, 17 PAS, and 13 MAV isolates by MEGA4 (3). PS-RuJK (GenBank Accession No. EU863652) nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities ranged from 96.3 to 99.2% and 93.7 to 98.7%, respectively, for available PAS isolates, and 89.9 to 90.5% and 85.5 to 86.9%, respectively, for available PAV isolates, and 78.3 to 79.5% and 70.0 to 72.5%, respectively, for available MAV isolates. Similarly, nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities JE-120JK (GenBank Accession No. EU863653) ranged from 95.2 to 98.6% and 90.6 to 96.9%, respectively, for PAS isolates, 88.8 to 90.1% and 83.1 to 84.4%, respectively, for PAV isolates, and 77.6 to 78.7% and 67.5 to 70.0%, respectively, for MAV isolates. Also, both of these isolates have the conserved amino acid motif ""SIPGS"" that is usually present in a variable region of the coat protein gene on the surface of virion (1) at position 52 to 56 of amino acid sequences of all published PAS-like isolates, including Vd29:AY167109, FH1:AJ223588, MA9516:AJ007926, FL2:AJ223586, ASL-1:AJ810418, and WS6603:DQ285680, contrary to ""PVFRP"" or ""LISGP"" motif in PAV or MAV, respectively. Therefore, the sequence data clearly confirm that these two isolates belong to the PAS species. To our knowledge, this is the first record of PAS detected in the Czech Republic. References: (1) C. A.

"27152647","articletitle","Nitrous Oxide Emission and Denitrifier Abundance in Two Agricultural Soils Amended with Crop Residues and Urea in the North China Plain."
"27152647","abstracttext","The application of crop residues combined with Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has been broadly adopted in China. Crop residue amendments can provide readily available C and N, as well as other nutrients to agricultural soils, but also intensify the N fixation, further affecting N2O emissions. N2O pulses are obviously driven by rainfall, irrigation and fertilization. Fertilization before rainfall or followed by flooding irrigation is a general management practice for a wheat-maize rotation in the North China Plain. Yet, little is known on the impacts of crop residues combined with N fertilizer application on N2O emission under high soil moisture content. A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of two crop residue amendments (maize and wheat), individually or in combination with N fertilizer, on N2O emissions and denitrifier abundance in two main agricultural soils (one is an alluvial soil, pH 8.55, belongs to Ochri-Aquic Cambosols, OAC, the other is a lime concretion black soil, pH 6.61, belongs to Hapli-Aquic Vertosols, HAV) under 80% WFPS (the water filled pore space) in the North China Plain. Each type soil contains seven treatments: a control with no N fertilizer application (CK, N0), 200 kg N ha(-1) (N200), 250 kg N ha(-1) (N250), maize residue plus N200 (MN200), maize residue plus N250 (MN250), wheat residue plus N200 (WN200) and wheat residue plus N250 (WN250). Results showed that, in the HAV soil, MN250 and WN250 increased the cumulative N2O emissions by 60% and 30% compared with N250 treatment, respectively, but MN200 and WN200 decreased the cumulative N2O emissions by 20% and 50% compared with N200. In the OAC soil, compared with N200 or N250, WN200 and WN250 increased the cumulative N2O emission by 40%-50%, but MN200 and MN250 decreased the cumulative N2O emission by 10%-20%. Compared with CK, addition of crop residue or N fertilizer resulted in significant increases in N2O emissions in both soils. The cumulative N2O emissions from the treatments of 250 kg N ha(-1) were 1.1-3.3 times higher than those of treatments with 200 kg N ha(-1) in both soils with adding equal amounts of the same type of crop residue. Abundance of the 16S rRNA gene did not significantly change in all treatments in two soils, but the nosZ and nirS genes were more abundant in soils amended with crop residues compared with CK or N-only treatments. N2O emission, however, were not related to the abundance of denitrifier containing nirS or nosZ. The research provided some information regarding the effect of crop residues with N fertilizer on N2O emissions and denitrifier abundances in two soils. Our results imply the property of crop residue and rate of N fertilizer are important influencing factors of N2O emission when crop residues combined with N fertilizer are applied to different agricultural soils."

"30754342","abstracttext","Isolates of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici belonging to the Ug99 race group are virulent to a broad spectrum of resistance genes, rendering most of the world's wheat germplasm susceptible to stem rust (3). Following the initial detection of Ug99 (TTKSK, North American [NA] race notation) in Uganda, virulence to the widely used Sr31 resistance gene has been reported from Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Iran (2,3). In November 2009, a wheat genotype suspected to carry Sr31 showed a susceptible response to stem rust in a disease nursery (29°08'05.02''S, 30°38'29.18''E), inoculated with race TTKSP, near Greytown in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Inoculation of urediniospores of the field collection (isolate UVPgt60) onto seedlings of line Federation4*/Kavkaz confirmed virulence for Sr31. In three independent, replicated, and comparative seedling tests, eight single-pustule isolates of UVPgt60 all typed to race PTKST following the NA race nomenclature. These isolates produced compatible infection types (ITs) (3+ to 4) on the Sr31 testers Gamtoos, Sr31/6*LMPG, Federation4*/Kavkaz, Kavkaz, and Clement, whereas isolate UVPgt59 (TTKSP) was avirulent (ITs ;1 to 1) on these genotypes. In addition to Sr31 virulence, the new race differed from TTKSP by producing a lower IT (2 to 2++) on Cns_T.mono_ deriv., the accepted entry for Sr21 in the NA differential set. The UVPgt60 isolates were clearly avirulent on Einkorn (Sr21) (IT ;1=), a response that also differed from those produced by BPGSC, TTKSF, and TTKSP (IT 2). With the exception of Sr21, UVPgt60 isolates had a virulence pattern similar to race TTKST (1), notably the virulence combination for Sr24 and Sr31. Isolate UVPgt60.6 was randomly selected for testing on additional Sr genes and South African wheat cultivars and breeding lines. Similar to the race identification experiments seedling tests were duplicated and compared with reactions produced by TTKSP and other races. Greenhouse temperatures for all seedling tests ranged between 18 and 25°C. On the basis of primary leaf responses, PTKST is avirulent (ITs 0; to 2++) for Sr13, 14, 21, 22, 25, 26, 27, 29, 32, 33, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42, 43, 44, Em, Tmp, and Satu and virulent (ITs 3 to 4) for Sr5, 6, 7b, 8a, 8b, 9a, 9b, 9d, 9e, 9g, 10, 11, 16, 17, 24, 30, 31, 34, 38, 41, and McN. From 103 South African wheat cultivars and lines tested as seedlings, 59 and 47 were susceptible (IT ≥ 3) to races PTKST and TTKSP, respectively. Simple-sequence repeat analysis (4) with selected primer pairs showed that PTKST clusters with isolates belonging to the Ug99 lineage. Subsequent to the collection made at Greytown, stem rust sampled in December 2009 from naturally infected breeders' lines at Cedara (29°32'19.59''S, 30°16'03.50''E), KwaZulu-Natal, revealed five isolates with a virulence profile similar to PTKST. On the basis of current evidence it appears that PTKST may be an introduction to South Africa rather than a single-step mutation from local stem rust races. References: (1) Y. Jin et al.

"25329912","abstracttext","Increased oxidative stress contributes to the functional impairment of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), the pivotal players in the servicing of the endothelial cell lining. Several evidences suggest that decreasing oxidative stress by natural compounds with antioxidant properties may improve EPCs bioactivity. Here, we investigated the effects of Lisosan G (LG), a Triticum Sativum grain powder, and Lady Joy (LJ), a bean lysate, on function of EPCs exposed to oxidative stress. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and plated on fibronectin-coated culture dishes; adherent cells, identified as early EPCs, were pre-treated with different concentrations of LG and LJ and incubated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Viability, senescence, adhesion, ROS production and antioxidant enzymes gene expression were evaluated. Lysate-mediated Nrf-2 (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2)/ARE (antioxidant response element) activation, a modulator of oxidative stress, was assessed by immunocytochemistry. Lady Joy 0.35-0.7 mg/ml increases EPCs viability; pre-treatment with either LG 0.7 mg/ml and LJ 0.35-0.7 mg/ml protect EPCs viability against H2O2-induced injury. LG 0.7 and LJ 0.35-0.7 mg/ml improve EPCs adhesion; pre-treatment with either LG 0.35 and 0.7 mg/ml or LJ 0.35, 0.7 and 1.4 mg/ml preserve adhesiveness of EPCs exposed to H2O2. Senescence is attenuated in EPCs incubated with lysates 0.35 mg/ml. After exposure to H2O2, LG pre-treated cells show a lower senescence than untreated EPCs. Lysates significantly decrease H2O2-induced ROS generation. Both lysates increase glutathione peroxidase-1 and superoxide dismutase-2 (SOD-2) expression; upon H2O2 exposure, pre-treatment with LJ allows higher SOD-2 expression. Heme oxigenase-1 increases in EPCs pre-treated with LG even upon H2O2 exposure. Finally, incubation with LG 0.7 mg/ml results in Nrf-2 translocation into the nucleus both at baseline and after the oxidative challenge. Our data suggest a protective effect of lysates on EPCs exposed to oxidative stress through the involvement of antioxidant systems. Lisosan G seems to activate the Nrf-2/ARE pathways."
"30699587","articletitle","First Report of Fusarium Root Rot of Stored Carrot Caused by Fusarium avenaceum in Serbia."
"30699587","abstracttext","Carrot (Daucus carota L. subsp. sativus (Hoffm.) Thell., Apiaceae), a widely consumed antioxidant-rich plant, is among the major vegetable crops grown in Serbia, with average annual production of 65,400 tons on approximately 7,000 ha (4). In May 2013, a severe root rot was observed on approximately 20% of cold-stored carrot roots originating from Gospođinci, South Bačka District, Serbia. Symptoms included dry rot of the collar and crown as well as large, brown to dark brown, circular, sunken lesions on the stored roots. Frequently, abundant whitish mycelium was observed covering the surface of the colonized roots. To determine the causal agent, small pieces of infected tissue were surface-disinfested with 2% NaOCl without rinsing, air-dried, and placed on potato dextrose agar. Five single-spore isolates obtained from collar and crown tissue sections, as well as nine isolates from root sections, all formed abundant, cottony white to pale salmon fungal colonies with reddish orange pigment on the reverse surface of the agar medium when grown at 25°C under 12 h of fluorescent light per day. All recovered isolates formed numerous, three- to six-septate, hyaline, needle-like, straight to slightly curved, fusoid macroconidia (30 to 80 × 4 to 5.5 μm, average 58.3 × 4.9 μm, n = 100 spores) each with a tapering apical cell. Microconidia of all isolates were generally scarce, two- to four-septate, spindle-shaped, and 15 to 35 × 3 to 5 μm (average 21.3 × 4.2 μm). Chlamydospores were not observed. Based on these morphological characteristics, the pathogen was identified as Fusarium avenaceum (Fries) Saccardo (1). The pathogenicity on carrot was tested for isolate 19-14 by inoculating each of five carrot roots surface-disinfected with 2% NaOCl, by placing a mycelial plug into the surface of a wound created with a cork borer. Carrot roots inoculated with sterilized PDA plugs served as a negative control treatment. After 5 days of incubating the roots at 25°C, root rot symptoms identical to those observed on the source carrot plants developed on all inoculated roots, and the pathogen was re-isolated from each of these roots using the same procedure descibed above. There were no symptoms on the control roots. Morphological species identification was confirmed by sequencing the translation elongation factor (EF-1α) gene (2). Total DNA was extracted directly from fungal mycelium of isolate 19-14 with a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and PCR amplification was performed with primer pair EF-1/EF-2 (2). Sequence analysis of the EF-1α gene revealed 100% nucleotide identity of isolate 19-14 (GenBank Accession No. KM102536) with the EF-1α sequences of two F. avenaceum isolates from Canada (KC999504 from rye and JX397864 from Triticum durum). To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. avenaceum causing collar, crown, and root rots of stored carrot in Serbia. Since F. avenaceum can produce several mycotoxins, including moniliformin, acuminatopyrone, and chrysogine (3), the presence of this pathogen on stored carrots could represent a significant constraint for carrot production in Serbia, for both direct yield losses and potential mycotoxin contamination.

"20569375","abstracttext_unlabelled","SUMMARY Downy mildew of Arabidopsis is not a hugely destructive disease of an important crop plant, neither is it of any economic importance. The most obvious symptom, the aerial conidiophores, might, at a glance to the casual observer, be mistaken for the trichomes normally present on the leaves. However, a huge research effort is being devoted to this humble pathosystem which became established as a laboratory model in the 1990s. Since then, enormous progress has been made in cloning and characterizing major genes for resistance (RPP genes) and in defining many of their downstream signalling components, some of them RPP-gene specific. Resistance is generally associated with an oxidative burst and a salicylic acid dependent hypersensitive reaction type of programmed cell death. Biological and chemical induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis protecting against downy mildew were demonstrated early on, and investigations of mutants have contributed fundamentally to our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and the mechanisms of plant defence. This review will attempt to collate the wealth of information which has accrued with this pathosystem in the last decade and will attempt to predict future research directions by drawing attention to some still unanswered questions."

(formerly Peronospora parasitica), Kingdom Chromista, Phylum Oomycota, Order Peronosporales, Family Peronosporaceae, Genus Hyaloperonospora, of which it is the type species. The taxonomy of the group of organisms causing downy mildew of brassicas has undergone a number of revisions since Corda (1837) originally coined the genus Peronospora. All isolates pathogenic on brassicas were described initially as P. parasitica but Gäumann (1918) classified isolates from different brassicaceous hosts distinctly and thus defined 52 new species based on conidial dimensions and host range. After much debate it was decided to revert to the aggregate species of P. parasitica for all brassica-infecting downy mildews, whilst recognizing that these show some isolate-specific differences (Yerkes and Shaw, 1959). The latest re-examination of P. parasitica by Constantinescu and Fatehi (2002) has placed isolates of P. parasitica and five other downy mildew species in a clear new subgroup on the basis of their hyaline conidiospores, recurved conidiophore branch tips and ITS1, ITS2 and 5.8S rDNA sequence comparisons; meriting the coining of the new genus 'Hyaloperonospora Constant'. The class Oomycetes in the Kingdom Chromista (Straminipila) comprises fungus-like organisms with heterokont zoospores (i.e. possessing two types of flagellae, whiplash and tinsel). The Oomycetes have non-septate hyphae with cellulose-based walls containing very little or no chitin. The latter is regarded as a major distinction separating the Oomycetes from the true fungi, and reports of the presence of chitin had generally been regarded as due to small amounts of contamination (Gams et al., 1998). However, in view of recent studies by Werner et al. (2002) showing a chitin synthase gene in an Oomycete and demonstrating the presence of the polymer itself by an interaction with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), it is perhaps safe to say that we have not seen the last taxonomic revision which will affect this group! The families within the Oomycetes show a clear evolutionary trend to a lesser absolute dependence on an aqueous environment and some members of the Peronosporales, e.g. H. parasitica, have no zoosporic stage in the life cycle."

"719755","articletitle","Altered translatability of messenger RNA from suspended anchorage-dependent fibroblasts: reversal upon cell attachment to a surface."
"719755","abstracttext","Anchorage-dependent cells, when forced into suspension culture, display a repertoire of dramatic, coordinated regulatory phenomena. Message production promptly decreases 5 gold but the cells maintain a constant amount of poly(A)+ by means of a concomitant stabilization of mRNA against decay. Protein synthesis shuts down much later and the mRNA is stored in a nonfunctioning state. In this study, the inactive mRNA is extracted from suspended cells and shown to have aberrant translation properties. Well defined polypeptides are apparently no longer synthesized when this mRNA directs protein formation in either reticulocyte or wheat germ-derived heterologous translation systems. Rather, shortened peptides are formed by this mRNA and these become smaller as mRNA is used from cells suspended for longer periods of time. Very few focused spots are formed when the aberrant polypeptides are analyzed in two-dimensional electrophoresis. The sedimentation properties of suspended cell mRNA and the size of poly(A) are unchanged from control monolayer cells. Cross-hybridization of cDNA transcribed from a control cell message population with suspended cell mRNA shows that all sequences are present in normal concentrations. While most identifiable spots disappear from the two-dimensional gel electropherograms of the protein products produced by suspended cell mRNA, a few polypeptides are still synthesized in relatively normal amounts. Conserved polypeptides are found in products of both the reticulocyte and wheat germ systems, but they are different products in each case. The lesion in the suspended cell mRNA does not seem to be at the 5' termini, since synthesis of the shortened peptides is fully sensitive to inhibition of pm7G. Cells that contain extensively modified message can resume protein synthesis when allowed to reattach to a solid substrate. There is an apparent remodification of mRNA to normal translatability within a few hours of cell reattachment, since mRNA from recovering cells quickly resumes directing relatively normal patterns of polypeptide synthesis in vitro. The restoration of normal message function occurs even when new message formation is blocked with actinomycin. Cells recovering after reattachment synthesize supranormal amounts of a few major proteins involved with cell structure, as shown in these studies by an increased amount of translatable sequences which encode these proteins. The most apparent enhanced message is that coding for actin. mRNA from recovering cells produces in vitro several times more actin relative to other proteins than does control cell mRNA. The enhancement of actin mRNA is not seen in the message population of cells that reattach in the presence of actinomycin. The results suggest a morphologically related induction of gene expression."
"10347051","articletitle","Analysis of fungal diversity in the wheat rhizosphere by sequencing of cloned PCR-amplified genes encoding 18S rRNA and temperature gradient gel electrophoresis."
"10347051","abstracttext","Like bacteria, fungi play an important role in the soil ecosystem. As only a small fraction of the fungi present in soil can be cultured, conventional microbiological techniques yield only limited information on the composition and dynamics of fungal communities in soil. DNA-based methods do not depend on the culturability of microorganisms, and therefore they offer an attractive alternative for the study of complex fungal community structures. For this purpose, we designed various PCR primers that allow the specific amplification of fungal 18S-ribosomal-DNA (rDNA) sequences, even in the presence of nonfungal 18S rDNA. DNA was extracted from the wheat rhizosphere, and 18S rDNA gene banks were constructed in Escherichia coli by cloning PCR products generated with primer pairs EF4-EF3 (1. 4 kb) and EF4-fung5 (0.5 kb). Fragments of 0.5 kb from the cloned inserts were sequenced and compared to known rDNA sequences. Sequences from all major fungal taxa were amplified by using both primer pairs. As predicted by computer analysis, primer pair EF4-EF3 appeared slightly biased to amplify Basidiomycota and Zygomycota, whereas EF4-fung5 amplified mainly Ascomycota. The 61 clones that were sequenced matched the sequences of 24 different species in the Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) database. Similarity values ranged from 0.676 to 1. Temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) analysis of the fungal community in the wheat rhizosphere of a microcosm experiment was carried out after amplification of total DNA with both primer pairs. This resulted in reproducible, distinctive fingerprints, confirming the difference in amplification specificity. Clear banding patterns were obtained with soil and rhizosphere samples by using both primer sets in combination. By comparing the electrophoretic mobility of community fingerprint bands to that of the bands obtained with separate clones, some could be tentatively identified. While 18S-rDNA sequences do not always provide the taxonomic resolution to identify fungal species and strains, they do provide information on the diversity and dynamics of groups of related species in environmental samples with sufficient resolution to produce discrete bands which can be separated by TGGE. This combination of 18S-rDNA PCR amplification and TGGE community analysis should allow study of the diversity, composition, and dynamics of the fungal community in bulk soil and in the rhizosphere."

"24663156","abstracttext","The objective of this study was to determine the impact of stocker production systems differing in growth rate on differential adipogenic and lipogenic gene expression of intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC), and perirenal (PR) adipose tissues. Angus steers were assigned to 4 stocker cattle production systems in 2 consecutive years: 1) cottonseed meal-based supplement while grazing dormant native range (CON), 2) ground corn/soybean meal-based supplement while grazing dormant native range (CORN), 3) grazing wheat pasture at a high stocking rate for a low rate of BW gain (LGWP), and 4) grazing wheat pasture at a low stocking rate for a high rate of BW gain (HGWP). Steers were harvested during the stocker phase at similar age (different carcass weight) in Exp. 1 (3 steers/treatment) or at similar carcass weight in Exp. 2 (4 steers/treatment). Adipose tissues were analyzed for mRNA expression of adipogenic (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ [PPARγ], sterol regulatory element binding factor 1 [SREBF1], CAATT/enhancer binding protein β, and delta-like homolog 1) and lipogenic (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GPDH], fatty acid synthase [FASN], and diacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 [DGAT2]) genes. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the expression of adipogenic or lipogenic genes collectively. There was not a treatment × adipose tissue interaction (F-test, P > 0.15) when steers were harvested at similar age, but a treatment × adipose tissue interaction (F-test, P < 0.05) was evident when steers were harvested at similar carcass weight. At similar carcass weight, treatment had no effect (P > 0.10) on the canonical variate of adipogenic or lipogenic mRNA expression in IM adipose tissue, but faster rates of gain of LGWP and HGWP steers increased (P < 0.10) the canonical variate of adipogenic and lipogenic mRNA expression in SC and PR adipose tissue compared with CON and CORN steers. Strong positive correlations (P < 0.05) of PPARγ, SREBF1, GPDH, FASN, and DGAT2 mRNA expression with the canonical variate indicate that these genes strongly influenced differences between treatments and adipose tissues. These results suggest that contrary to our hypothesis rate of gain has little influence on differentiation and lipid synthesis of IM adipose tissue at similar carcass weight but faster rates of gain increase differentiation and lipid synthesis of SC and PR adipose tissue even at similar carcass weight."

"24570428","abstracttext","Necrotic enteritis caused by Clostridium perfringens has become prevalent in the European Union due to the withdrawal of antibiotics in poultry feed. In an experiment with a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement, 336 one-day-old male broiler chicks (Ross 308) were assigned to 4 groups with or without C. perfringens challenge and fed wheat-based diets supplemented with or without xylanase at 5,500 U/kg of diet. The study aimed to investigate effects of xylanase addition on growth performance as well as nutrient digestion and absorption of C. perfringens-infected broilers. Before challenge (d 0-14), xylanase-supplemented birds had greater ADG and lower feed conversion ratio (FCR; P < 0.05). During infection (d 14-21), challenge tended to decrease ADG (P = 0.063) and significantly increased FCR (P < 0.05), whereas xylanase addition greatly reduced FCR (P < 0.05). Clostridium perfringens infection decreased AME values and apparent ileal digestibility of DM of diets (P < 0.05). Xylanase supplementation increased AME values regardless of infection and apparent ileal digestibility of CP in challenged birds (P < 0.05). Activities of duodenal α-amylase and chymotrypsin and pancreatic trypsin were decreased by C. perfringens infection (P < 0.05). Xylanase supplementation elevated pancreatic chymotrypsin activity and reduced duodenal α-amylase and trypsin activities (P < 0.05). It also decreased jejunal α-amylase activity and increased pancreatic α-amylase as well as jejunal sucrase activities in uninfected birds (P < 0.05). The duodenal mRNA expression of sodium glucose cotransporter 1 (SGLT1), H(+)-dependent peptide transporter 1 (PepT1), and liver fatty acid-binding protein (L-FABP) were downregulated (P < 0.05), but ileal SGLT1 gene expression was increased by infection (P < 0.05). Xylanase addition upregulated expression of jejunal SGLT1, PepT1, and L-FABP genes as well as ileal PepT1 and L-FABP genes in challenged broilers (P < 0.05). In conclusion, xylanase supplementation of wheat-based diets improved FCR and AME in birds irrespective of C. perfringens infection and elevated apparent ileal digestibility of CP and mRNA expression of nutrient transporters in challenged birds."

"28612272","abstracttext","Isolates of the Fusarium graminearum species complex (FGSC, n = 446) were collected from wheat spikes from northern and western regions of Iran with a history of Fusarium head blight (FHB) occurrences. The trichothecene mycotoxin genotypes/chemotypes, the associated phylogenetic species, and geographical distribution of these isolates were analyzed. Two phylogenetic species, Fusarium asiaticum and F. graminearum, were identified and were found to belong to sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) groups V and I. Isolates from F. asiaticum species lineage 6 were within SCAR group V, whereas F. graminearum species lineage 7 were of SCAR group I. Of the 446 isolates assayed, 274 were F. asiaticum species predominantly of the nivalenol (NIV) genotype, while other isolates were either deoxynivalenol (DON) plus 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-AcDON) or DON plus 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-AcDON) genotype. Based on Tri7 gene sequences, a new subpopulation of 15-AcDON producers was observed among F. asiaticum strains in which 11-bp repeats were absent in the Tri7 sequences. The trichothecene chemotype was confirmed and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 46 FGSC isolates. Isolates produced NIV (33.4-108.2 μg/g) and DON (64.7-473.6 μg/g) plus either 3-AcDON (51.4-142.4 μg/g) or 15-AcDON (24.1-99.3 μg/g). Among FGSC isolates, F. asiaticum produced the highest levels of trichothecenes. Using BIOCLIM based on the climate data of 20-year during 1994-2014, modelling geographical distribution of FGSC showed that F. asiaticum was restricted to warmer and humid areas with a median value of mean annual temperature of about 17.5 °C and annual rainfall of 658 mm, respectively (P < 0.05). In contrast, F. graminearum (only 15-AcDON producers) was restricted to cooler and drier areas, with a median value of the mean annual temperature of 14.4 °C and an annual rainfall of 384 mm, respectively (P < 0.05). Based on climate parameters at anthesis, the recorded distribution of F. graminearum and F. asiaticum was similar to that based on BIOCLIM parameters. Therefore, geographic differences on the wheat-growing areas in Iran have had a significant effect on distribution of FGSC and their trichothecene chemotypes."

"27986728","abstracttext","The present study aimed to investigate whether alternative dietary protein sources modulate the microbial communities in the distal intestine (DI) of Atlantic salmon, and whether alterations in microbiota profiles are reflected in modifications in host intestinal function and health status. A 48-day feeding trial was conducted, in which groups of fish received one of five diets: a reference diet in which fishmeal (diet FM) was the only protein source and four experimental diets with commercially relevant compositions containing alternative ingredients as partial replacements of fishmeal, i.e., poultry meal (diet PM), a mix of soybean meal and wheat gluten (diet SBMWG), a mix of soy protein concentrate and poultry meal (diet SPCPM), and guar meal and wheat gluten (diet GMWG). Samples were taken of DI digesta and mucosa for microbial profiling using high-throughput sequencing and from DI whole tissue for immunohistochemistry and expression profiling of marker genes for gut health. Regardless of diet, there were significant differences between the microbial populations in the digesta and the mucosa in the salmon DI. Microbial richness was higher in the digesta than the mucosa. The digesta-associated bacterial communities were more affected by the diet than the mucosa-associated microbiota. Interestingly, both legume-based diets (SBMWG and GMWG) presented high relative abundance of lactic acid bacteria in addition to alteration in the expression of a salmon gene related to cell proliferation ( pcna ). It was, however, not possible to ascertain the cause-effect relationship between changes in bacterial communities and the host's intestinal responses to the diets. IMPORTANCE The intestine of cultivated Atlantic salmon shows symptoms of compromised function, which are most likely caused by imbalances related to the use of new feed ingredients. Intestinal microbiota profiling may become in the future a valuable endpoint measurement in order to assess fish intestinal health status and effects of diet. The present study aimed to gain information about whether alternative dietary protein sources modulate the microbial communities in the Atlantic salmon intestine and whether alterations in microbiota profiles are reflected in alterations in host intestinal function and health status. We demonstrate here that there are substantial differences between the intestinal digesta and mucosa in the presence and abundance of bacteria. The digesta-associated microbiota showed clear dependence on the diet composition, whereas mucosa-associated microbiota appeared to be less affected by diet composition. Most important, the study identified bacterial groups associated with diet-induced gut dysfunction that may be utilized as microbial markers of gut health status in fish."
"29463659","articletitle","A Near-Complete Haplotype-Phased Genome of the Dikaryotic Wheat Stripe Rust Fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici Reveals High Interhaplotype Diversity."
"29463659","abstracttext","A long-standing biological question is how evolution has shaped the genomic architecture of dikaryotic fungi. To answer this, high-quality genomic resources that enable haplotype comparisons are essential. Short-read genome assemblies for dikaryotic fungi are highly fragmented and lack haplotype-specific information due to the high heterozygosity and repeat content of these genomes. Here, we present a diploid-aware assembly of the wheat stripe rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici based on long reads using the FALCON-Unzip assembler. Transcriptome sequencing data sets were used to infer high-quality gene models and identify virulence genes involved in plant infection referred to as effectors. This represents the most complete Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici genome assembly to date (83 Mb, 156 contigs, N 50 of 1.5 Mb) and provides phased haplotype information for over 92% of the genome. Comparisons of the phase blocks revealed high interhaplotype diversity of over 6%. More than 25% of all genes lack a clear allelic counterpart. When we investigated genome features that potentially promote the rapid evolution of virulence, we found that candidate effector genes are spatially associated with conserved genes commonly found in basidiomycetes. Yet, candidate effectors that lack an allelic counterpart are more distant from conserved genes than allelic candidate effectors and are less likely to be evolutionarily conserved within the P. striiformis species complex and Pucciniales In summary, this haplotype-phased assembly enabled us to discover novel genome features of a dikaryotic plant-pathogenic fungus previously hidden in collapsed and fragmented genome assemblies. IMPORTANCE Current representations of eukaryotic microbial genomes are haploid, hiding the genomic diversity intrinsic to diploid and polyploid life forms. This hidden diversity contributes to the organism's evolutionary potential and ability to adapt to stress conditions. Yet, it is challenging to provide haplotype-specific information at a whole-genome level. Here, we take advantage of long-read DNA sequencing technology and a tailored-assembly algorithm to disentangle the two haploid genomes of a dikaryotic pathogenic wheat rust fungus. The two genomes display high levels of nucleotide and structural variations, which lead to allelic variation and the presence of genes lacking allelic counterparts. Nonallelic candidate effector genes, which likely encode important pathogenicity factors, display distinct genome localization patterns and are less likely to be evolutionary conserved than those which are present as allelic pairs. This genomic diversity may promote rapid host adaptation and/or be related to the age of the sequenced isolate since last meiosis."

"28954842","abstracttext","Background: Whole grains have shown potential for improving gut health, but evidence comparing different whole-grain types is lacking. Objective: We investigated whether whole-grain wheat (WGW) and whole-grain rye (WGR) improve gut health in different ways compared to refined wheat (RW), with the primary outcomes of microbiota composition and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. Methods: In a randomized parallel trial, 70 healthy adults (in means ± SDs; aged 51.0 ± 9.4 y, body mass index [BMI (in kg/m 2 )] 27.8 ± 1.9, 32:38 men:women) replaced cereal foods from their habitual diet with WGR, WGW, or RW (control). Before and after a 6-wk intervention, a spot stool sample was collected and analyzed for short-chain fatty acids and microbiota composition through the use of 16S ribosomal RNA gene-targeted high-throughput amplicon sequencing. GI symptoms and stool regularity were evaluated by questionnaires at baseline and after weeks 2, 4, and 6. Results: Intakes of whole grains were 145.2 ± 75.9, 124.2 ± 57.3, and 5.4 ± 3.2 g/d in the WGW, WGR, and RW groups, respectively. Gut microbiota composition was not affected by diet. The relative change in fecal butyrate decreased in the RW (-38%) group compared to the WGW (25%, P = 0.014) and WGR groups (-1%, P = 0.037). Other short-chain fatty acids were unaffected. Flatulence was more frequent following intake of WGW (OR: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.03, 4.17) and WGR (OR: 2.62, 95% CI: 1.35, 5.22) compared to RW, whereas bloating was less frequent following WGW (OR: 0.38, 95% CI: 0.18, 0.80) and WGR (OR: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.16, 0.72). Stool frequency increased following WGR but not WGW, compared to RW in weeks 2 (0.4 defecations/d, P = 0.049) and 4 (0.5 defecations/d, P = 0.043), but not in week 6. The WGW and WGR groups did not differ from each other in any of the variables tested. Conclusion: Regular consumption of WGR and WGW affected fecal butyrate concentration and gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy overweight adults, supporting the hypothesis that WGR and WGW can be included in the diet equally to maintain gut health. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02358122."

"29692769","abstracttext","Soil microbial communities have profound effects on the growth, nutrition and health of plants in agroecosystems. Understanding soil microbial dynamics in cropping systems can assist in determining how agricultural practices influence soil processes mediated by microorganisms. In this study, soil bacterial communities were monitored in a continuously monocropped Jerusalem artichoke (JA) system, in which JA was successively monocropped for 3 years in a wheat field. Soil bacterial community compositions were estimated by amplicon sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. Abundances of ammonia-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria were estimated by quantitative PCR analysis of the amoA , nirS , and nirK genes. Results showed that 1-2 years of monocropping of JA did not significantly impact the microbial alpha diversity, and the third cropping of JA decreased the microbial alpha diversity ( P < 0.05). Principal coordinates analysis and permutational multivariate analysis of variance analyses revealed that continuous monocropping of JA changed soil bacterial community structure and function profile ( P < 0.001). At the phylum level, the wheat field was characterized with higher relative abundances of Latescibacteria , Planctomycetes , and Cyanobacteria , the first cropping of JA with Actinobacteria , the second cropping of JA with Acidobacteria , Armatimonadetes , Gemmatimonadetes , and Proteobacteria . At the genus level, the first cropping of JA was enriched with bacterial species with pathogen-antagonistic and/or plant growth promoting potentials, while members of genera that included potential denitrifiers increased in the second and third cropping of JA. The first cropping of JA had higher relative abundances of KO terms related to lignocellulose degradation and phosphorus cycling, the second cropping of JA had higher relative abundances of KO terms nitrous-oxide reductase and nitric-oxide reductase, and the third cropping of JA had higher relative abundances of KO terms nitrate reductase and nitrite reductase. The abundances of amoA genes decreased while nirK increased in the third cropping of JA, nirS continuously increased in the second and third cropping of JA ( P < 0.05). Redundancy analysis and Mantel test found that soil organic carbon and Olsen phosphorus contents played important roles in shaping soil bacterial communities. Overall, our results revealed that continuous monocropping of JA changed soil bacterial community composition and its functional potentials."

"31035348","abstracttext","To clarify the changes in field populations of Fusarium head blight (FHB) pathogens over a decade, Fusarium species and trichothecene genotypes associated with FHB on wheat were monitored in Hebei province during the periods 2005-2006 and 2013-2016. Fusarium species determination was carried out by morphological identification, species-specific amplification and partial translation elongation factor (TEF-1α) gene sequencing. Trichothecene genotype prediction was carried out by primers 3CON/3NA/3D15A/3D3 or Tri13F/Tri13R, Tri303F/Tri303R and Tri315F/Tri315R. A total of 778 purified Fusarium isolates were recovered from 42 sampling sites in 17 counties during the period 2005-2006 and 1002 Fusarium isolates were recovered from 122 sampling sites in 65 counties during the period 2013-2016. F. graminearum was the predominant pathogen recovered during the periods 2005-2006 and 2013-2016. However, the pathogen composition differed slightly between the two periods. In 2005-2006, 752 out of 778 (96.7%) of the isolates belonged to F. graminearum . Two were identified as F. culmorum . Five other Fusarium species were also recovered, F. equiseti , F. verticillioides , F. proliferatum , F. subglutinans and F. chlamydosporum , with lower recoveries of 0.4%, 0.8%, 0.8%, 0.1% and 1.0%, respectively. Trichothecene genotype prediction showed that all the 752 F. graminearum isolates were of the 15-ADON genotype. Five Fusarium species were recovered from samples collected over the period 2013-2016. F. graminearum was again the predominant pathogen with an isolation frequency of 97.6%. F. pseudograminearum , F. asiaticum , F. culmorum and F. negundis were also isolated at a recovery of 1.4%, 0.7%, 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. For the 2013-2016 isolates, 971 of the 978 F. graminearum strains were 15-ADON whereas seven isolates were of the 3-ADON type. All seven F. asiaticum isolates were of the NIV type and fourteen F. pseudograminearum isolates were classified as 3-ADON. F. pseudograminearum was first isolated from FHB in Hebei in 2013. Although the recovery of F. pseudograminearum is still low, it represents a small shift in the pathogen composition and trichothecene genotypes associated with FHB in Hebei province. As Fusarium crown rot of wheat caused by F. pseudograminearum is an increasing problem in Hebei province, it is appropriate to monitor the role of F. pseudograminearum in FHB in the future."

"32299364","abstracttext_background","High post-anthesis (p.a) temperatures reduce mature grain weights in wheat and other cereals. However, the causes of this reduction are not entirely known. Control of grain expansion by the maternally derived pericarp of the grain has previously been suggested, although this interaction has not been investigated under high p.a. temperatures. Down-regulation of pericarp localised genes that regulate cell wall expansion under high p.a. temperatures may limit expansion of the encapsulated endosperm due to a loss of plasticity in the pericarp, reducing mature grain weight. Here the effect of high p.a. temperatures on the transcriptome of the pericarp and endosperm of the wheat grain during early grain-filling was investigated via RNA-Seq and is discussed alongside grain moisture dynamics during early grain development and mature grain weight."
"32299364","abstracttext_results","High p.a. temperatures applied from 6-days after anthesis (daa) and until 18daa reduced the grain's ability to accumulate water, with total grain moisture and percentage grain moisture content being significantly reduced from 14daa onwards. Mature grain weight was also significantly reduced by the same high p.a. temperatures applied from 6daa for 4-days or more, in a separate experiment. Comparison of our RNA-Seq data from whole grains, with existing data sets from isolated pericarp and endosperm tissues enabled the identification of subsets of genes whose expression was significantly affected by high p.a. temperature and predominantly expressed in either tissue. Hierarchical clustering and gene ontology analysis resulted in the identification of a number of genes implicated in the regulation of cell wall expansion, predominantly expressed in the pericarp and significantly down-regulated under high p.a. temperatures, including endoglucanase, xyloglucan endotransglycosylases and a β-expansin. An over-representation of genes involved in the 'cuticle development' functional pathway that were expressed in the pericarp and affected by high p.a. temperatures was also observed."
"32299364","abstracttext_conclusions","High p.a. temperature induced down-regulation of genes involved in regulating pericarp cell wall expansion. This concomitant down-regulation with a reduction in total grain moisture content and grain weight following the same treatment period, adds support to the theory that high p.a. temperatures may cause a reduction in mature grain weight as result of decreased pericarp cell wall expansion."

"30343924","abstracttext","The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) dosing on bacterial fermentation and bacterial community composition (BCC), to set up a subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) nutritional model in vitro, and to determine the best sampling time for LPS dosing in a dual-flow continuous culture system. Diets were randomly assigned to 6 fermentors in a replicated 3 × 3 Latin square with three 11-d experimental periods that consisted of 7 d for diet adaptation and 4 d for sample collection. Treatments were control diet (CON), wheat and barley diet (WBD) to induce SARA, and control diet + LPS (LPSD). Fermenters were fed 72 g of dry matter/d. The forage:concentrate ratio of CON was 65:35. The WBD diet was achieved by replacing 40% of dry matter of the CON diet with 50% ground wheat and 50% ground barley. The LPS concentration in LPSD was 200,000 endotoxin units, which was similar to that observed in cows with SARA. The SARA inducing and LPS dosing started at d 8. The BCC was determined by sequencing the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene using the Illumina MiSeq platform (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). The LPSD and CON maintained pH above 6 for the entire experimental period, and the WBD kept pH between 5.2 and 5.6 for 4 h/d, successfully inducing SARA. Digestibility of neutral detergent fiber and crude protein in LPSD were not different from WBD but tended to be lower than CON. Lipopolysaccharide dosing had no effect on pool of VFA concentrations and profiles but decreased bacterial N; the pattern changes of VFA and LPS in LPSD started to increase and be similar to WBD 6 h after LPS dosing. Pool of LPS concentration was around 11-fold higher in WBD and 4-fold higher in LPSD than CON. In the solid fraction, the BCC of LPSD was different from WBD and tended to be different from CON. In the liquid fraction, the BCC was different among treatments. The LPS dosing increased the relative abundance of Succinimonas, Anaeroplasma, Succinivibrio, Succiniclasticum, and Ruminobacter, which are main gram-negative bacteria related to starch digestion. Our results suggest that LPS dosing does not affect pH alone. However, LPS could drive the development of SARA by affecting bacteria and bacterial fermentation. For future studies, samples are suggested to be taken 6 h after LPS dosing in a dual-flow continuous culture system."

"20565642","articletitle","Stem rust of small grains and grasses caused by Puccinia graminis."
"20565642","abstracttext_unlabelled","SUMMARY Stem rust has been a serious disease of wheat, barley, oat and rye, as well as various important grasses including timothy, tall fescue and perennial ryegrass. The stem rust fungus, Puccinia graminis, is functionally an obligate biotroph. Although the fungus can be cultured with difficulty on artificial media, cultures grow slowly and upon subculturing they develop abnormal ploidy levels and lose their ability to infect host plants [Bushnell and Bosacker (1982) Can. J. Bot. 60, 1827-1836]. P. graminis is a typical heteroecious rust fungus with the full complement of five distinct spore stages that occur during asexual reproduction on its gramineous hosts and sexual reproduction that begins in the resting spore stage and culminates on the alternate host, barberry (Berberis spp.). There appears to be little polymorphism for resistance/susceptibility in Berberis species, but complex polymorphisms of resistance/susceptibility and matching virulence/avirulence exist in gene-for-gene relationships between small grain species and the forms of P. graminis that infect them."
"20565642","abstracttext_taxonomy","Puccinia graminis is a rust fungus in the phylum Basidiomycota, class Urediniomycetes, order Uredinales, and family Pucciniaceae, which contains 17 genera and approximately 4121 species, of which the majority are in the genus Puccinia[Kirk et al. (2001) Ainsworth and Bisby's Dictionary of the Fungi. Wallingford, UK: CAB International]. Various subdivisions of P. graminis into subspecies, varieties and formae speciales have been proposed based on spore size and host range. Crossing studies and DNA sequence comparisons support the separation of at least two subspecies, but not the proposed separation based on spore size."
"20565642","abstracttext_host range","The host range of P. graminis is very broad compared with that of most Puccinia spp.; it includes at least 365 species of cereals and grasses in 54 genera [Anikster (1984) The Cereal Rusts. Orlando, FL: Academic Press, pp. 115-130]. Wheat stem rust, P. graminis f. sp. tritici, was shown to infect 74 species in 34 genera in artificial inoculations of seedlings, but only 28 of those species belonging to eight genera were known to be natural hosts of the fungus. Other formae speciales of P. graminis have narrower host ranges than P. graminis f. sp. tritici. Disease symptoms: Infections in cereals or grasses occur mainly on stems and leaf sheaths, but occasionally they may be found on leaf blades and glumes as well. The first macroscopic symptom is usually a small chlorotic fleck, which appears a few days after infection. About 8-10 days after infection, a pustule several millimetres long and a few millimetres wide is formed by rupture of the host epidermis from pressure of a mass of brick-red urediniospores produced in the infection. These uredinial pustules are generally linear or diamond shaped and may enlarge up to 10 mm long. The powdery masses of urediniospores appear similar to rust spots on a weathered iron surface. With age, the infection ceases production of brick-red urediniospores and produces a layer of black teliospores in their place, causing the stems of heavily infected plants to appear blackened late in the season."
"30722434","articletitle","First Report of Fusarium temperatum Causing Seedling Blight and Stalk Rot on Maize in Spain."
"30722434","abstracttext","In Europe, several diseases of maize (Zea mays L.) including seedling blight and stalk rot are caused by different Fusarium species, mainly Fusarium graminearum, F. verticillioides, F. subglutinans, and F. proliferatum (3). In recent years, these Fusarium spp. have received significant attention not only because of their impact on yield and grain quality, but also for their association with mycotoxin contamination of maize kernels (1,4). From October 2011 to October 2012, surveys were conducted in a maize plantation located in Galicia (northwest Spain). In each sampling, 100 kernels and 10 maize stalks were collected from plants exhibiting symptoms of ear and stalk rot. Dried kernels and small stalk pieces (1 to 2 cm near the nodes) were placed onto potato dextrose agar medium and incubated in the dark for 7 days. Fungal colonies displaying morphological characteristics of Fusarium spp. (2) were subcultured as single conidia onto SNA (Spezieller Nahrstoffarmer agar) (2) and identified by morphological characteristics, as well as by DNA sequence analysis. A large number of Fusarium species (F. verticillioides, F. subglutinans, F. graminearum, and F. avenaceum) (1,2) were identified. These Fusarium species often cause ear and stalk rot on maize. In addition, a new species, F. temperatum, recently described in Belgium (3), was also identified. F. temperatum is within the Gibberella fujikuroi species complex and is morphologically and phylogenetically closely related to F. subglutinans (2,3). Similar to previous studies (3), our isolates were characterized based on the presence of white cottony mycelium, becoming pinkish white. Conidiophores were erect, branched, and terminating in 1 to 3 phialides. Microconidia were abundant, hyaline, 0 to 2 septa; ellipsoidal to oval, produced singly or in false heads, and on monophialides, intercalary phialides, and polyphialides. Microconidia were not produced in chains. No chlamydospores were observed (3). Macroconidia in carnation leaf agar medium (2) were hyaline, 3 to 6 septate, mostly 4, falcate, with a distinct foot-like basal cell (2,3). DNA was amplified with primers ITS1/ITS4 and EF1/EF2 (3). Partial sequences of gene EF-1α showed 100% homology with F. temperatum (3) (GenBank Accession Nos. HM067687 and HM067688). DNA sequences of EF-1α gene and ITS region obtained were deposited in GenBank (KC179824, KC179825, KC179826, and KC179827). Pathogenicity of one representative isolate was confirmed using a soil inoculation method adapted from Scauflaire et al., 2012 (4). F. temperatum isolate was cultured on sterile wheat grains. Colonized wheat grains (10 g) were mixed with sterilized sand in 10 cm diameter pots. Ten kernels per pot were surface disinfected in 2% sodium hypochlorite for 10 min, rinsed with sterilized water, drained (4), placed on the soil surface, and covered with a 2 cm layer of sterilized sand. Five pots were inoculated and five uninoculated controls were included. Pots were maintained at 22 to 24°C and 80% humidity for 30 days. Seedling malformations, chlorosis, shoot reduction, and stalk rot were observed on maize growing in inoculated soil and not from controls. F. temperatum was reisolated from the inoculated seedlings but not from the controls. References: (1) B. J. Bush et al. Phytopathology 94:88, 2003. (2) J. F. Leslie et al.

"8428965","abstracttext","The aging of IMR-90 human diploid fibroblasts in culture is accompanied by a 5-7 fold decrease in the level of thymidine kinase (TK) mRNA and TK activity (Chang, Z. F., and Chen, K. Y. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 11431-11435). We have employed a gel mobility shift analysis to investigate the molecular basis of the age-dependent attenuation of TK gene expression. Several cis-elements including two inverted CCAAT boxes, located at base pairs (bp) -36 and -67, and GC-rich Sp1 binding sites have been identified in the TK promoter. A 28-bp (-91 to -64) fragment containing the distal inverted CCAAT element was excised from the TK promoter to examine possible differences in nuclear protein binding between young and old IMR-90 cells. A prominent DNA-protein complex was identified in serum-stimulated young cells by a gel mobility shift assay. Competition analysis indicated that the binding was highly specific. The nuclear protein responsible for the complex formation was named CBP/tk (CCAAT Binding Protein for TK gene) since methylation interference assay showed that the inverted CCAAT box was involved in binding. The appearance of the CBP/tk-28-bp complex in IMR-90 cells was (i) serum-dependent, becoming prominent 12-24 h after serum stimulation, and (ii) age-dependent, prominent only in young but not in old IMR-90 cells. Similar serum- and age-dependent complex formations were also observed using a 67-bp fragment (-63 to +4) containing the proximal CCAAT element and a TATA box. In contrast, the binding activities for the Sp1 sequence were the same in young and old cells and appeared to be serum-independent. CBP/tk binding activity in nuclear extracts was abolished by heat (60 degrees C, 5 min) or treatment with proteinase K (0.1 microgram/ml) and sodium dodecyl sulfate (0.005%), but not by Nonidet P-40 or Triton X-100. Treatment of nuclear extracts with alkaline phosphatase or lectins (concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin) did not affect the binding activity. Metal chelators such as 1,10-ortho-phenanthroline (0.5 mM) inhibited the CBP/tk binding activity. Cycloheximide added to the serum-stimulated cultures at an early or mid-G1 phase inhibited the CBP/tk binding activity. The half-life of the serum-induced CBP/tk binding activity was estimated to be less than 1 h.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"
"8380067","articletitle","Role of nuclear pore complex in simian virus 40 nuclear targeting."
"8380067","abstracttext","Cytoplasmically injected simian virus 40 (SV40) virions enter the nucleus through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and can express large T antigen shortly thereafter (J. Clever, M. Yamada, and H. Kasamatsu, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 88:7333-7337, 1991). The nuclear import of the protein components of introduced SV40 was reversibly arrested by chilling and energy depletion, corroborating our previous observation that the nuclear entry of injected SV40 is blocked in the presence of wheat germ agglutinin and an antinucleoporin monoclonal antibody (mAb414), general inhibitors of NPC-mediated import. The nuclear accumulation of virion protein components and large T antigen in nonpermissive NIH 3T3 cells was similar to that in the permissive host, indicating that the ability to use NPCs as a route of nuclear entry appears to be a general property of the injected virus. Injected virions were capable of completing their lytic cycle and forming plaques in permissive cells. During the early phase of SV40 infection, the cytoplasmic injection of mAb414 effectively blocked nuclear T-antigen accumulation for up to 8 h of infection but had very little effect after 12 h of infection. The time-dependent interference with nuclear T-antigen accumulation by the antinucleoporin antibody is consistent with the hypothesis that the infecting virions enter the nucleus through NPCs. The interference study also suggests that the early phase of infection consists of at least two steps: a step for virion cell entry and intracytoplasmic trafficking and a step for virion nuclear entry followed by large-T-antigen gene expression and subsequent nuclear localization of the gene product. Virions were visualized as electron-dense particles in ultrathin sections of samples in which transport was permitted or arrested. In the former cells, electron-dense particles were predominantly observed in the nucleus. The virions were distributed randomly and nonuniformly in the nucleoplasm but were not observed in heterochromatin or in nucleoli. In the latter cells, the electron-dense particles were seen intersecting the nuclear envelope, near the inner nuclear membrane, and in NPCs. In tangential cross sections of NPCs, which appeared as donut-shaped structures, a spherical electron-dense particle was observed in the center of the structure. Immunoelectron microscopy revealed that NPCs were selectively decorated with 5-nm colloidal gold particles-anti-Vp1 immunoglobulin G at the cytoplasmic entrance to and in NPCs, confirming that the morphologically observed electron-dense particles in NPCs contain the viral structural protein. These results support the hypothesis that the nuclear import of SV40 is catalyzed through NPCs by an active transport mechanism that is similar to that of other karyophiles."

"12018270","abstracttext","IOGEN Corporation of Ottawa, Canada, has recently built a 40t/d biomass-to-ethanol demonstration plant adjacent to its enzyme production facility. It has partnered with the University of Toronto to test the C6/C5 cofermenta-tion performance characteristics of the National Renewable Energy Labora-tory's metabolically engineered Zymomonas mobilis using various biomass hydrolysates. IOGEN's feedstocks are primarily agricultural wastes such as corn stover and wheat straw. Integrated recombinant Z. mobilis strain AX101 grows on D-xylose and/or L-arabinose as the sole carbon/energy sources and ferments these pentose sugars to ethanol in high yield. Strain AX101 lacks the tetracycline resistance gene that was a common feature of other recombinant Zm constructs. Genomic integration provides reliable cofermentation performance in the absence of antibiotics, another characteristic making strain AX101 attractive for industrial cellulosic ethanol production. In this work, IOGEN's biomass hydrolysate was simulated by a pure sugar medium containing 6% (w/v) glucose, 3% xylose, and 0.35% arabinose. At a level of 3 g/L (dry solids), corn steep liquor with inorganic nitrogen (0.8 g/L of ammonium chloride or 1.2 g/L of diammonium phosphate) was a cost-effective nutritional supplement. In the absence of acetic acid, the maximum volumetric ethanol productivity of a continuous fermentation at pH 5.0 was 3.54 g/L x h. During prolonged continuous fermentation, the efficiency of sugar-to-ethanol conversion (based on total sugar load) was maintained at >85%. At a level of 0.25% (w/v) acetic acid, the productivity decreased to 1.17 g/L x h at pH 5.5. Unlike integrated, xylose-utilizing rec Zm strain C25, strain AX101 produces less lactic acid as byproduct, owing to the fact that the Escherichia coli arabinose genes are inserted into a region of the host chromosome tentatively assigned to the gene for D-lactic acid dehydrogenase. In pH-controlled batch fermentations with sugar mixtures, the order of sugar exhaustion from the medium was glucose followed by xylose and arabinose. Both the total sugar load and the sugar ratio were shown to be important determinants for efficient cofermentation. Ethanol at a level of 3% (w/v) was implicated as both inhibitory to pentose fermentation and as a potentiator of acetic acid inhibition of pentose fermentation at pH 5.5. The effect of ethanol may have been underestimated in other assessments of acetic acid sensitivity. This work underscores the importance of employing similar assay conditions in making comparative assessments of biocatalyst fermentation performance."

"15221451","abstracttext","We have developed 85 new markers (50 RFLPs, 5 SSRs, 12 DD cDNAs, 9 ESTs, 8 HSP-encoding cDNAs and one BSA-derived AFLP marker) for saturation mapping of QTL regions for drought tolerance in rice, in our efforts to identify putative candidate genes. Thirteen of the markers were localized in the close vicinity of the targeted QTL regions. Fifteen of the additional markers mapped, respectively, inside one QTL region controlling osmotic adjustment on chromosome 3 ( oa3.1) and 14 regions that affect root traits on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12. Differential display was used to identify more putative candidate genes and to saturate the QTL regions of the genetic map. Eleven of the isolated cDNA clones were found to be derived from drought-inducible genes. Two of them were unique and did not match any genes in the GenBank, while nine were highly similar to cDNAs encoding known proteins, including a DnaJ-related protein, a zinc-finger protein, a protease inhibitor, a glutathione-S-transferase, a DNA recombinase, and a protease. Twelve new cDNA fragments were mapped onto the genetic linkage map; seven of these mapped inside, or in close proximity to, the targeted QTL regions determining root thickness and osmotic adjustment capacity. The gene I12A1, which codes for a UDP-glucose 4-epimerase homolog, was identified as a putative target gene within the prt7.1/brt7.1 QTL region, as it is involved in the cell wall biogenesis pathway and hence may be implicated in modulating the ability of rice roots to penetrate further into the substratum when exposed to drought conditions. RNAs encoding elongation factor 1beta, a DnaJ-related protein, and a homolog of wheat zinc-finger protein were more prominently induced in the leaves of IR62266 (the lowland rice parent of the mapping materials used) than in those of CT9993 (the upland rice parent) under drought conditions. Homologs of 18S ribosomal RNA, and mRNAs for a multiple-stress induced zinc-finger protein, a protease inhibitor, and a glutathione-S-transferase were expressed at significantly higher levels in CT9993 than in IR62266. Thus several genes involved in the regulation of DNA structure and mRNA translation were found to be drought-regulated, and may be implicated in drought resistance."

"17468432","abstracttext","Two experiments were conducted to investigate the concept that the addition of corn expressing an Escherichia coli-derived gene (corn-based phytase; CBP) to a P-deficient diet would improve growth performance and P utilization in pigs. An E. coli-derived microbial phytase (expressed in Pichia pastoris) sprayed onto a wheat carrier (Quantum) was included for comparison. In Exp. 1, forty-eight 10-kg pigs were blocked by BW into 6 blocks and allotted to 8 dietary treatments such that the BW among dietary treatments was similar and given free access to feed for 28 d. The dietary treatments were a negative control (NC) with no inorganic P supplementation; NC + 2, 4, or 6 g of monosodium phosphate/kg; NC + 16,500, 33,000, or 49,500 phytase units (FTU) of CBP/kg; and NC + 16,500 FTU of Quantum/kg. In Exp. 2, twenty-four 13-kg barrows were assigned to the NC, NC + 16,500 or 33,000 FTU of CBP/kg, or NC + 16,500 FTU of Quantum/kg, in a nutrient- and energy-balance study consisting of 5 d of adjustment and 5-d collection periods. The total collection method was used to determine nutrient and energy balance. Addition of CBP to the low-P NC diet linearly increased (P < 0.01) ADG, G:F, and plasma P concentration of pigs during the 28-d study. There was no difference in ADG, G:F, or plasma P concentration between pigs fed the CBP or Quantum phytase at 16,500 FTU/kg. Weight gain, G:F, and plasma P concentration of pigs increased (P < 0.01) with monosodium phosphate supplementation, confirming P deficiency of the NC diet. Linear improvements (P < 0.05) in DM digestibility and energy retention were observed with CBP supplementation of the NC diet. Although there were linear (P < 0.01) and quadratic (P < 0.05) increases in N digestibility, N retention was unaffected by CBP supplementation of the NC diet in growing pigs. Phosphorus and Ca digestibilities and retentions improved linearly and quadratically (P < 0.01) with the addition of CBP to the NC diet. There was no difference in digestive utilization of P or Ca between pigs fed CBP and Quantum phytase at 16,500 FTU/kg. The data showed that the addition of a corn expressing an E. coli-derived gene to a P-deficient diet improved growth performance and indices of P utilization in pigs, and corn expressing phytase was as efficacious as Quantum phytase when supplemented in P-deficient diets for weanling pigs."

It is polyphyletic, exhibiting many distinct allopolyploid genome combinations, and its history might be further complicated by introgression and lineage sorting. We focus on a subset of Elymus species with a tetraploid genome complement derived from Pseudoroegneria (genome St) and Hordeum (H). We confirm the species' allopolyploidy, identify possible genome donors, and pinpoint instances of apparent introgression or incomplete lineage sorting."
"20543952","abstracttext_methodology/principal findings","We sequenced portions of three unlinked nuclear genes-phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, beta-amylase, and granule-bound starch synthase I-from 27 individuals, representing 14 Eurasian and North American StStHHElymus species. Elymus sequences were combined with existing data from monogenomic representatives of the tribe, and gene trees were estimated separately for each data set using maximum likelihood. Trees were examined for evidence of allopolyploidy and additional reticulate patterns. All trees confirm the StStHH genome configuration of the Elymus species. They suggest that the StStHH group originated in North America, and do not support separate North American and European origins. Our results point to North American Pseudoroegneria and Hordeum species as potential genome donors to Elymus. Diploid P. spicata is a prospective St-genome donor, though conflict among trees involving P. spicata and the Eurasian P. strigosa suggests either introgression of GBSSI sequences from P. strigosa into North American Elymus and Pseudoroegneria, or incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral GBSSI polymorphism. Diploid H. californicum and/or allotetraploid H. jubatum are possible H-genome donors; direct involvement of an allotetraploid Hordeum species would simultaneously introduce two distinct H genomes to Elymus, consistent with some of the relationships among H-genome sequences in Hordeum and Elymus."

In spite of difficulties with interpretation, differences among gene trees allow us to identify reticulate species and develop hypotheses about underlying evolutionary processes."
"20427415","articletitle","Anther-specific carbohydrate supply and restoration of metabolically engineered male sterility."
"20427415","abstracttext","Male-sterile plants are used in hybrid breeding as well as for gene confinement for genetically modified plants in field trials and agricultural production. Apart from naturally occurring mutations leading to male sterility, biotechnology has added new possibilities for obtaining male-sterile plants, although so far only one system is used in practical breeding due to limitations in propagating male-sterile plants without segregations in the next generation or insufficient restoration of fertility when fruits or seeds are to be harvested from the hybrid varieties. Here a novel mechanism of restoration for male sterility is presented that has been achieved by interference with extracellular invertase activity, which is normally specifically expressed in the anthers to supply the developing microspores with carbohydrates. Microspores are symplastically isolated in the locular space of the anthers, and thus an unloading pathway of assimilates via the apoplasmic space is mandatory for proper development of pollen. Antisense repression of the anther-specific cell wall invertase or interference with invertase activity by expressing a proteinacious inhibitor under the control of the anther-specific invertase promoter results in a block during early stages of pollen development, thus causing male sterility without having any pleiotropic effects. Restoration of fertility was successfully achieved by substituting the down-regulated endogenous plant invertase activity by a yeast invertase fused to the N-terminal portion of potato-derived vacuolar protein proteinase II (PiII-ScSuc2), under control of the orthologous anther-specific invertase promoter Nin88 from tobacco. The chimeric fusion PiII-ScSuc2 is known to be N-glycosylated and efficiently secreted from plant cells, leading to its apoplastic location. Furthermore, the Nin88::PiII-ScSuc2 fusion does not show effects on pollen development in the wild-type background. Thus, such plants can be used as paternal parents of a hybrid variety, thereby the introgression of Nin88::PiII-ScSuc2 to the hybrid is obtained and fertility is restored. In order to broaden the applicability of this male sterility/restoration system to other plant species, a phylogenic analysis of plant invertases(beta-fructofuranosidases) and related genes of different species was carried out. This reveals a specific clustering of the cell wall invertases with anther-specific expression for dicotyl species and another cluster for monocotyl plants. Thus, in both groups of plants, there seems to be a kind of co-evolution, but no recent common ancestor of these members of the gene family. These findings provide a helpful orientation to classify corresponding candidate genes in further plant species, in addition to the species analysed so far (Arabidopsis, tobacco, tomato, potato, carrots, rice, and wheat)."

"19878583","abstracttext_background","One theoretical explanation for the relatively poor performance of Brassica rapa (weed) x Brassica napus (crop) transgenic hybrids suggests that hybridization imparts a negative genetic load. Consequently, in hybrids genetic load could overshadow any benefits of fitness enhancing transgenes and become the limiting factor in transgenic hybrid persistence. Two types of genetic load were analyzed in this study: random/linkage-derived genetic load, and directly incorporated genetic load using a transgenic mitigation (TM) strategy. In order to measure the effects of random genetic load, hybrid productivity (seed yield and biomass) was correlated with crop- and weed-specific AFLP genomic markers. This portion of the study was designed to answer whether or not weed x transgenic crop hybrids possessing more crop genes were less competitive than hybrids containing fewer crop genes. The effects of directly incorporated genetic load (TM) were analyzed through transgene persistence data. TM strategies are proposed to decrease transgene persistence if gene flow and subsequent transgene introgression to a wild host were to occur."
"19878583","abstracttext_results","In the absence of interspecific competition, transgenic weed x crop hybrids benefited from having more crop-specific alleles.

However under interspecific competition with wheat or more weed-like conditions (i.e. representing a situation where hybrid plants emerge as volunteer weeds in subsequent cropping systems), there was a positive correlation between the number of B. rapa weed-specific AFLP markers and seed yield (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001), although no such correlation was detected for vegetative biomass. When genetic load was directly incorporated into the hybrid genome, by inserting a fitness-mitigating dwarfing gene that that is beneficial for crops but deleterious for weeds (a transgene mitigation measure), there was a dramatic decrease in the number of transgenic hybrid progeny persisting in the population."

A recently developed one-color multiplex array format allowed flexible, effective, and parallel examinations of eight RNA samples."
"21255412","abstracttext_results","We took advantage of the 8 × 15 k Agilent format to design, evaluate, and apply a novel microarray covering the whole F. graminearum genome to analyze transcriptional responses to azole fungicide treatment. Comparative statistical analysis of expression profiles uncovered 1058 genes that were significantly differentially expressed after azole-treatment. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis for 31 selected genes indicated high conformity to results from the microarray hybridization. Among the 596 genes with significantly increased transcript levels, analyses using GeneOntology and FunCat annotations detected the ergosterol-biosynthesis pathway genes as the category most significantly responding, confirming the mode-of-action of azole fungicides. Cyp51A, which is one of the three F. graminearum paralogs of Cyp51 encoding the target of azoles, was the most consistently differentially expressed gene of the entire study. A molecular phylogeny analyzing the relationships of the three CYP51 proteins in the context of 38 fungal genomes belonging to the Pezizomycotina indicated that CYP51C (FGSG_11024) groups with a new clade of CYP51 proteins. The transcriptional profiles for genes encoding ABC transporters and transcription factors suggested several involved in mechanisms alleviating the impact of the fungicide. Comparative analyses with published microarray experiments obtained from two different nutritional stress conditions identified subsets of genes responding to different types of stress. Some of the genes that responded only to tebuconazole treatment appeared to be unique to the F. graminearum genome."
"21255412","abstracttext_conclusions","The novel F. graminearum 8 × 15 k microarray is a reliable and efficient high-throughput tool for genome-wide expression profiling experiments in fungicide research, and beyond, as shown by our data obtained for azole responses. The array data contribute to understanding mechanisms of fungicide resistance and allow identifying fungicide targets."
"25939883","articletitle","Stress and inflammatory gene networks in bovine liver are altered by plane of dietary energy during late pregnancy."
"25939883","abstracttext","The prepartal dietary energy level is tightly correlated with the degree of tissue mobilization that the animal experiences around parturition (giving birth). To better understand the link between the dry period dietary energy management and the inflammatory status around parturition, 12 multiparous Holstein cows were fed for the entire dry period either a high-wheat straw/lower-energy diet to supply at least 100% of the calculated net energy for lactation (NEL) (control, CON) or a higher-energy diet to supply >140% of NEL (overfed, OVE). The blood was sampled throughout the transition period for biomarker analyses. Liver tissue samples were taken on days -14, 7, 14, and 30 relative to parturition for triacylglycerol (TAG) composition and gene expression analysis. Fifty genes involved in inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and oxidative stress, and cell cycle and growth were evaluated. Although blood biomarkers did not reveal signs of a greater inflammatory status compared with OVE, CON cows had a greater activation of the intrahepatic unfolded protein response prepartum. However, postpartum mRNA profiling indicated that the OVE group experienced a mild but sustained level of ER stress, with higher oxidative stress and impairment of antioxidant mechanisms. After parturition, inflammation-related genes were upregulated in OVE cows compared with CON. However, CON cows experienced a gradual increase in expression of key inflammatory transcription regulators up to 30 days postpartum which agreed with the lower plasma albumin and cholesterol, suggesting an inflammatory state. Data underscored that ER stress is not necessarily linked with inflammation during the peripartal period. Gene expression data also suggest that prepartum overnutrition could have negative effects on normal cell cycle activity. Overall, allowing cows to overconsume energy prepartum increased the hepatic pro-inflammatory response prepartum and up to the point of parturition. Subsequently, cows fed the lower-energy diet experienced a gradual increase in the inflammatory response. The lack of differences between groups in voluntary feed intake and lactation capacity suggests that nutritional management prepartum triggers different mechanisms that affect ER and oxidative stress along with inflammation. Although no clinical disorders were detected, these alterations expose animals to the development of immuno-metabolic disorders."

"26664943","abstracttext","The objective of the present study was to identify potential biomarkers for gut barrier failure in chickens. A total of 144 day-of-hatch Ross 308 male broiler chickens were housed in 24 battery cages with six chicks per cage. Cages were randomly assigned to either a control group (CON) or gut barrier failure (GBF) group. During the first 13 days, birds in CON or GBF groups were fed a common corn-soy starter diet. On day 14, CON chickens were switched to a corn grower diet, and GBF chickens were switched to rye-wheat-barley grower diet. In addition, on day 21, GBF chickens were orally challenged with a coccidiosis vaccine. At days 21 and 28, birds were weighed by cage and feed intake was recorded to calculate feed conversion ratio. At day 28, one chicken from each cage was euthanized to collect intestinal samples for morphometric analysis, blood for serum, and intestinal mucosa scrapings for gene expression. Overall performance and feed efficiency was severely affected (P < 0.05) by a GBF model when compared with CON group at days 21 and 28. Duodenum of GBF birds had wider villi, longer crypt depth, and higher crypt depth/villi height ratio than CON birds. Similarly, GBF birds had longer crypt depth in jejunum and ileum when compared with CON birds. Protein levels of endotoxin and α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) in serum, as well as mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-8, IL-1β, transforming growth factor (TGF)-β4, and fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) 6 were increased (P < 0.05) in GBF birds compared to CON birds; however, mRNA levels of FABP2, occludin, and mucin 2 (MUC2) were reduced by 34% (P < 0.05), 24% (P = 0.107), and 29% (P = 0.088), respectively, in GBF birds compared to CON birds. The results from the present study suggest that serum endotoxin and AGP, as well as, gene expression of FABP2, FABP6, IL-8, IL-1β, TGF-β4, occludin, and MUC2 in mucosa may work as potential biomarkers for gut barrier health in chickens."

"28586046","abstracttext","Ultrasound‑targeted microbubble destruction (UTMD) can promote the entry of plasmid DNA (pDNA) into the cell cytoplasm, by increasing the permeability of the cell membrane. But the transfection efficiency remains low due to inability of the pDNA to enter the nucleus. Various methods have been explored to improve the UTMD transfection efficiency, but with little success. In cells, the classic nuclear localization signal (cNLS) peptide is an amino acid sequence that signals proteins that are due for nuclear transport. The present study aimed to investigate whether binding of a cNLS peptide to the pDNA may improve the transfection efficiency of UTMD. Four experimental groups were analyzed: Control group (UTMD + pDNA), group with cNLS (UTMD + pDNA + cNLS), group with mutated NLS (mNLS; UTMD + pDNA + mNLS), and group with cNLS and the nuclear import blocker, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA; UTMD + pDNA + cNLS + WGA). The NLS was labeled by fluorescein isothiocyanate, whereas pDNA was labeled with Cy3. Different molar ratios were tested for the NLS and pDNA combination in order to achieve optimal binding of the two molecules. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were then transfected using the optimum ultrasonic irradiation parameters and NLS/pDNA molar ratio. At 6 h post‑transfection, the rates of Cy3‑labeled pDNA inside the cells and their nuclei were detected by flow cytometry and laser confocal microscopy, and the cellular vs. nuclear uptake of pDNA was calculated. In order to further evaluate the effect of NLS on UTMD‑mediated gene transfection, the transfection efficiency and relative expression levels of mRNA and protein were detected at 48 h post‑transfection. The results demonstrated that the optimal molar ratio of NLS with pDNA was 104:1. The rates of pDNA successful entry into the cell and nucleus were significantly higher in the cNLS group compared with the control group. The transfection efficiency, and relative expression levels of mRNA and protein from the plasmid were significantly increased in the cNLS group compared with the control group. The mNLS group displayed no significant difference compared with the control group, while the WGA group exhibited significant inhibition in most indicators of transfection efficiency compared to the cNLS group. These results suggest that combining a cNLS peptide with pDNA during UTMD‑mediated transfection significantly improved transfection efficiency. Thus, a cNLS peptide may be an important mediator and a new strategy in enhancing the efficiency of UTMD‑mediated gene transfection."

Despite its long history of use in food fermentation and bioethanol production, very little is known about the basic physiology and genomic features of S. fibuligera ."
"27872659","abstracttext_results","We performed whole-genome (WG) de novo sequencing and complete assembly of S. fibuligera KJJ81 and KPH12, two isolates from wheat-based Nuruk in Korea. Intriguingly, the KJJ81 genome (~38 Mb) was revealed as a hybrid between the KPH12 genome (~18 Mb) and another unidentified genome sharing 88.1% nucleotide identity with the KPH12 genome. The seven chromosome pairs of KJJ81 subgenomes exhibit highly conserved synteny, indicating a very recent hybridization event. The phylogeny inferred from WG comparisons showed an early divergence of S. fibuligera before the separation of the CTG and Saccharomycetaceae clades in the subphylum Saccharomycotina . Reconstructed carbon and sulfur metabolic pathways, coupled with RNA-Seq analysis, suggested a marginal Crabtree effect under high glucose and activation of sulfur metabolism toward methionine biosynthesis under sulfur limitation in this yeast. Notably, the lack of sulfate assimilation genes in the S. fibuligera genome reflects a unique phenotype for Saccharomycopsis clades as natural sulfur auxotrophs. Extended gene families, including novel genes involved in saccharification and proteolysis, were identified. Moreover, comparative genome analysis of S. fibuligera ATCC 36309, an isolate from chalky rye bread in Germany, revealed that an interchromosomal translocation occurred in the KPH12 genome before the generation of the KJJ81 hybrid genome."

"28119474","articletitle","Negative Autogenous Control of the Master Type III Secretion System Regulator HrpL in Pseudomonas syringae."
"28119474","abstracttext","The type III secretion system (T3SS) is a principal virulence determinant of the model bacterial plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae T3SS effector proteins inhibit plant defense signaling pathways in susceptible hosts and elicit evolved immunity in resistant plants. The extracytoplasmic function sigma factor HrpL coordinates the expression of most T3SS genes. Transcription of hrpL is dependent on sigma-54 and the codependent enhancer binding proteins HrpR and HrpS for hrpL promoter activation. hrpL is oriented adjacently to and divergently from the HrpL-dependent gene hrpJ, sharing an intergenic upstream regulatory region. We show that association of the RNA polymerase (RNAP)-HrpL complex with the hrpJ promoter element imposes negative autogenous control on hrpL transcription in P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000. The hrpL promoter was upregulated in a ΔhrpL mutant and was repressed by plasmid-borne hrpL In a minimal Escherichia coli background, the activity of HrpL was sufficient to achieve repression of reconstituted hrpL transcription. This repression was relieved if both the HrpL DNA-binding function and the hrp-box sequence of the hrpJ promoter were compromised, implying dependence upon the hrpJ promoter. DNA-bound RNAP-HrpL entirely occluded the HrpRS and partially occluded the integration host factor (IHF) recognition elements of the hrpL promoter in vitro, implicating inhibition of DNA binding by these factors as a cause of negative autogenous control. A modest increase in the HrpL concentration caused hypersecretion of the HrpA1 pilus protein but intracellular accumulation of later T3SS substrates. We argue that negative feedback on HrpL activity fine-tunes expression of the T3SS regulon to minimize the elicitation of plant defenses."
"28119474","abstracttext_importance","The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has warned that agriculture will need to satisfy a 50% to 70% increase in global food demand if the human population reaches 9 billion by 2050 as predicted. However, diseases caused by microbial pathogens represent a major threat to food security, accounting for over 10% of estimated yield losses in staple wheat, rice, and maize crops. Understanding the decision-making strategies employed by pathogens to coordinate virulence and to evade plant defenses is vital for informing crop resistance traits and management strategies. Many plant-pathogenic bacteria utilize the needle-like T3SS to inject virulence factors into host plant cells to suppress defense signaling. Pseudomonas syringae is an economically and environmentally devastating plant pathogen. We propose that the master regulator of its entire T3SS gene set, HrpL, downregulates its own expression to minimize elicitation of plant defenses. Revealing such conserved regulatory strategies will inform future antivirulence strategies targeting plant pathogens."

"32307528","abstracttext","The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of diet complexity and l-Thr supplementation level on the growth performance, immune response, intestinal barrier function, and microbial metabolites in nursery pigs. Thirty-two weaned pigs (body weight 7.23 ± 0.48 kg) were randomly assigned to dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement based on diet complexity (complex or simple) and dietary Thr content. The complex diet contained fish meal, plasma protein, and dried whey to mimic a conventional nursery diet. The simple diet was formulated with corn, wheat, and soybean meal and did not contain any animal products. l-Thr was supplemented to each diet to supply either 100% (STD Thr) or 115% (SUP Thr) of the NRC (2012) requirement for standardized ileal digestible Thr. Pigs were individually housed and fed experimental diets ad libitum for 14 d. Diet complexity, dietary Thr content, and their interactions were considered the main effects. Pigs fed the simple diet had greater (P < 0.05) plasma interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6 concentrations compared with those fed the complex diet on days 7 and 14, respectively. Simple diet-fed pigs tended to show greater (P < 0.10) expression of genes encoding for tumor necrosis factor-α, claudin-1, and zonula occludens-1 in the jejunum compared with complex diet-fed pigs. The simple diet-fed pigs had greater (P < 0.05) concentrations of NH3-N in the jejunum digesta than did complex diet-fed pigs. The SUP Thr increased (P < 0.05) villus height and goblet cell (GC) density in villi and crypts in the jejunum and deepened (P < 0.05) crypts in the proximal colon. The SUP Thr resulted in the upregulation (P < 0.05) of occludin gene expression and a tendency toward the downregulation (P = 0.10) of IL-6 gene expression in the jejunum. Interactions (P < 0.05) between diet complexity and l-Thr supplementation level were observed in GC density in the crypt, NH3-N concentration in the jejunum, and the contents of acetate, propionate, and total volatile fatty acids in the colon. In conclusion, feeding a simple diet to nursery pigs resulted in systemic and intestinal inflammation. The SUP Thr diet did not normalize the simple diet-induced inflammation but improved gut integrity. SUP Thr seems to have greater benefits with a simple diet than with a complex diet. Therefore, SUP Thr in a simple diet could be a beneficial nutritional strategy for enhancing gut health."

"30231853","abstracttext_background","The genome-wide expression profile of genes in different tissues/cell types and developmental stages is a vital component of many functional genomic studies. Transcriptome data obtained by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) is often deposited in public databases that are made available via data portals. Data visualization is one of the first steps in assessment and hypothesis generation. However, these databases do not typically include visualization tools and establishing one is not trivial for users who are not computational experts. This, as well as the various formats in which data is commonly deposited, makes the processes of data access, sharing and utility more difficult.

The popular eFP browser does an excellent job of presenting transcriptome data in an easily interpretable view, but previous implementation has been mostly on a case-by-case basis. Here we present an integrated visualisation database of transcriptome data-sets from six species that did not previously have public-facing visualisations. We combine the eFP browser, for gene-by-gene investigation, with the Degust browser, which enables visualisation of all transcripts across multiple samples. The two visualisation interfaces launch from the same point, enabling users to easily switch between analysis modes. The tools allow users, even those without bioinformatics expertise, to mine into data-sets and understand the behaviour of transcripts of interest across samples and time.

"30186298","abstracttext","While substantial progress has been made in understanding defense responses of cereals to insect herbivores, comparatively little is known about responses to feeding by spider mites. Nevertheless, several spider mite species, including the generalist Tetranychus urticae and the grass specialist Oligonychus pratensis , cause damage on cereals such as maize and wheat, especially during drought stress. To understand defense responses of cereals to spider mites, we characterized the transcriptomic responses of maize and barley to herbivory by both mite species, and included a wounding control against which modulation of defenses could be tested. T. urticae and O. pratensis induced highly correlated changes in gene expression on both maize and barley. Within 2 h, hundreds of genes were upregulated, and thousands of genes were up- or downregulated after 24 h. In general, expression changes were similar to those induced by wounding, including for genes associated with jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling. Many genes encoding proteins involved in direct defenses, or those required for herbivore-induced plant volatiles, were strongly upregulated in response to mite herbivory. Further, biosynthesis genes for benzoxazinoids, which are specialized compounds of Poaceae with known roles in deterring insect herbivores, were induced in maize. Compared to chewing insects, spider mites are cell content feeders and cause grossly different patterns of tissue damage. Nonetheless, the gene expression responses of maize to both mite herbivores, including for phytohormone signaling pathways and for the synthesis of the benzoxazinoid 2-hydroxy-4,7-dimethoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one glucoside, a known defensive metabolite against caterpillars, resembled those reported for a generalist chewing insect, Spodoptera exigua . On maize plants harboring mutations in several benzoxazinoid biosynthesis genes, T. urticae performance dramatically increased compared to wild-type plants. In contrast, no difference in performance was observed between mutant and wild-type plants for the specialist O. pratensis . Collectively, our data provide little evidence that maize and barley defense responses differentiate herbivory between T. urticae and O. pratensis . Further, our work suggests that the likely route to specialization for O. pratensis involved the evolution of a robust mechanism to cope with the benzoxazinoid defenses of its cereal hosts."

Previous studies revealed that codon mutations of the myosin-5 gene of Fusarium spp. conferred resistance to phenamacril in vitro lab experiments. In this study, PCR-RFLP (polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism) was developed to detect three common mutations (A135T, GCC to ACC at codon 135; S217L, TCA to TTA at codon 217, and E420K, GAA to AAA at codon 420) in F. graminearum induced by fungicide domestication in vitro . PCR products of 841 bp (for mutation of A135T), 802 bp (for mutation of S217L) or 1649 bp (for mutation of E420K) in myosin-5 gene were amplified respectively by appropriate primer pairs. Restriction enzyme Kpn Ⅰ, Tas Ⅰ or Dra Ⅰ was used to distinguish phenamacril-sensitive and -resistant strains with mutation genotypes of A135T, S217L and E420K, respectively. Kpn Ⅰ digested the 841 bp PCR products of phenamacri-resistant strains with codon mutation A135T into two fragments of 256 bp and 585 bp.

"30708751","abstracttext","From September 2009 to October 2012, surveys to determine population structure of Fusarium species on maize were conducted in 22 provinces in China, where the disease incidence ranged from 5 to 20% in individual fields. Maize ears with clear symptoms of Fusarium ear rot (with a white to pink- or salmon-colored mold at the ear tip) were collected from fields. Symptomatic kernels were surface-sterilized (1 min in 0.1% HgCl 2 , and 30 s in 70% ethanol, followed by three rinses with sterile distilled water), dried, and placed on PDA. After incubation for 3 to 5 days at 28°C in the dark, fungal colonies displaying morphological characteristics of Fusarium spp. (2) were purified by transferring single spores and identified to species level by morphological characteristics (2), and DNA sequence analysis of translation elongation factor-1α (TEF) and β-tubulin genes. A large number of Fusarium species (mainly F. graminearum species complex, F. verticillioides, and F. proliferatum) were identified. These Fusarium species are the main causal agents of maize ear rot (2). Morphological characteristics of six strains from Anhui, Hubei, and Yunnan provinces were found to be identical to those of F. kyushuense (1), which was mixed with other Fusarium species in the natural infection in the field. Colonies grew fast on PDA with reddish-white and floccose mycelia. The average growth rate was 7 to 9 mm per day at 25°C in the dark. Reverse pigmentation was deep red. Microconidia were obovate, ellipsoidal to clavate, and 5.4 to 13.6 (average 8.8) μm in length. Macroconidia were straight or slightly curved, 3- to 5-septate, with a curved and acute apical cell, and 26.0 to 50.3 (average 38.7) μm in length. No chlamydospores were observed. Identity of the fungus was further investigated by sequence comparison of the partial TEF gene (primers EF1/2) and β-tubulin gene (primers T1/22) of one isolate (3). BLASTn analysis of the TEF amplicon (KC964133) and β-tubulin gene (KC964152) obtained with cognate sequences available in GenBank database revealed 99.3 and 99.8% sequence identity, respectively, to F. kyushuense. Pathogenicity tests were conducted twice by injecting 2 ml of a prepared spore suspension (5 × 10 5 spores/ml) into maize ears (10 per isolate of cv. Zhengdan958) through silk channel 4 days post-silk emergence under field conditions in Wuhan, China. Control plants were inoculated with sterile distilled water. The ears were harvested and evaluated 30 days post-inoculation. Reddish-white mold was observed on inoculated ears and the infected kernels were brown. No symptoms were observed on water controls. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by re-isolating the pathogen from infected kernels. F. kyushuense, first described on wheat in Japan (1), has also been isolated from rice seeds in China (4). It was reported to produce both Type A and Type B trichothecene mycotoxins (1), which cause toxicosis in animals. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. kyushuense causing maize ear rot in China and this disease could represent a serious risk of yield losses and mycotoxin contamination in maize and other crops. The disease must be considered in existing disease management practices. References: (1) T. Aoki and K. O'Donnell. Mycoscience 39:1, 1998. (2) J. F. Leslie and B. A. Summerell.

"1757999","articletitle","Evolution of a family of N-acetylglucosamine binding proteins containing the disulfide-rich domain of wheat germ agglutinin."
"1757999","abstracttext","A disulfide-rich domain, first identified in wheat germ agglutinin, has now been identified in the amino acid and DNA sequences of a large number of other chitin-binding proteins. This 43-residue domain includes eight disulfide-linked cysteines and has been implicated in the binding of N-acetylglucosamine and its polymers. This study used 12 complementary DNA sequences and 1 amino acid sequence of proteins with one, two, and four copies of this domain to infer a 44-amino acid residue ancestor sequence for this domain, and to derive an evolutionary tree relating these domains in the different proteins. The tree relating these single-domain sequences is divided into two major branches, one consisting of the multidomain dimeric lectins, which we have earlier suggested arose by duplication of a single copy of the disulfide-rich domain, and the other branch consisting of the monomeric chitinases and wound-inducible proteins, which have a single copy of the domain fused to a larger polypeptide. Reference to the three-dimensional structure of WGA and its saccharide complexes shows that the saccharide-binding residues as well as cysteine and glycine residues are conserved among all available sequences. In contrast, many residues at the dimer interface of the domains of WGA are not conserved in those proteins with a single domain, implying that the aggregation state of the domains in these proteins differs from that of the gras lectins. Also, the base compositions of the four-domain and one-domain branches of the tree differ, indicating distinct selective pressures at the level of both protein structure and the gene or its transcript."

"2026615","abstracttext","Dystrophin was purified from rabbit skeletal muscle by alkaline dissociation of dystrophin-glycoprotein complex which was first prepared by derivatized lectin chromatography. Dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was isolated from digitonin-solubilized rabbit skeletal muscle membranes by a novel two-step method involving succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (sWGA) chromatography and DEAE-cellulose ion exchange chromatography. Proteins co-purifying with dystrophin were a protein triplet of Mr 59,000 and four glycoproteins of Mr 156,000, 50,000, 43,000, and 35,000, all previously identified as components of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. Alkaline treatment of sWGA/DEAE-purified dystrophin-glycoprotein complex resulted in complete dissociation of the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex. In order to separate dystrophin from its associated proteins, alkaline-dissociated dystrophin-glycoprotein complex was sedimented by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The residual glycoproteins which contaminated peak dystrophin-containing gradient fractions were then removed by WGA-Sepharose adsorption. The resulting protein appeared as a single band with an apparent Mr of 400,000 on overloaded Coomassie Blue-stained gels. The absence of WGA-peroxidase staining on nitrocellulose transfers of the pure protein indicated that the pure protein was devoid of contaminating glycoproteins. Antisera raised against the carboxyl terminus of human skeletal muscle dystrophin (which does not cross-react with the carboxyl terminus of the chromosome 6-encoded dystrophin-related protein) recognized the pure protein as did antisera specific for the amino terminus of human dystrophin. These data indicate that the protein isolated is indeed the intact, predominant skeletal muscle isoform product of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene."

"1879424","abstracttext","In Trypanosoma brucei (stock 427) genes encoding the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase are present on two homologous chromosomes. We have cloned and characterized one of the alleles. Two large, tandemly arranged open reading frames were found, each coding for a pyruvate kinase polypeptide of 498 amino acids. The gene sequences differ at 15 positions, resulting in five amino acid substitutions. The calculated molecular masses of the polypeptides are 54,378 Da and 54,363 Da. These values are somewhat smaller than those reported for the subunit molecular mass of the purified protein, which is 57-59 kDa. However, in vitro translation of the DNA region corresponding to the open reading frame, and translation of the RNA in a wheat-germ lysate, yielded a product that comigrated exactly with the native polypeptide in SDS/PAGE. The overall identity between the sequences of the trypanosomal enzyme and the enzymes from other sources is 41-51%. The conserved residues are not equally distributed over the polypeptide. The primary structure of domains A and, to a lesser extent, B, which constitute the active site, are rather well conserved. In contrast, the sequence of domain C, which supposedly is involved in the regulation of the enzyme activity, is much more variable. The cytosolically located pyruvate kinase of T. brucei lacks the specific features found in the majority of the glycolytic enzymes of this organism that are sequestered in a microbody-like organelle, the glycosome. It has neither a relatively high subunit molecular mass, due to unique insertions or terminal extensions, nor a high excess of positively charged amino acids. The polypeptide is shorter than that of most other pyruvate kinases and the calculated net charge is only +3."

"6096873","abstracttext","Spacer-length (sl) variation in ribosomal RNA gene clusters (rDNA) was surveyed in 502 individual barley plants, including samples from 50 accessions of cultivated barley, 25 accessions of its wild ancestor, and five generations of composite cross II (CCII), an experimental population of barley. In total, 17 rDNA sl phenotypes, made up of 15 different rDNA sl variants, were observed. The 15 rDNA sl variants comprise a complete ladder in which each variant differs in length from adjacent variants by approximately equal to 115 nucleotide pairs. Studies of four rDNA sl variants in an F2 population showed that these variants are located at two unlinked loci, Rrn1 and Rrn2, each with two codominant alleles. Using wheat-barley addition lines, we determined that Rrn1 and Rrn2 are located on chromosomes 6 and 7, respectively. The nonrandom distribution of sl variants between loci suggests that genetic exchange occurs much less frequently between than within the two loci, which demonstrates that Rrn1 and Rrn2 are useful as new genetic markers. Frequencies of rDNA sl phenotypes and variants were monitored over 54 generations in CCII. A phenotype that was originally infrequent in CCII ultimately became predominant, whereas the originally most frequent phenotype decreased drastically in frequency, and all other phenotypes originally present disappeared from the population. We conclude that the sl variants and/or associated loci are under selection in CCII."

"6134733","abstracttext","An undecanucleotide extended hybridization probe has been used to screen a rat medullary thyroid carcinoma cDNA library for clones which contain preprosomatostatin sequences. The nucleotide sequence encoding rat preprosomatostatin is reported. The sequence of cDNA contains 67 nucleotides in the 3'-noncoding region, 84 nucleotides in the 5'-untranslated region, and 458 bases corresponding to the coding region. The mRNA codes for a somatostatin precursor 116 amino acids in length (Mr = 12,773). The preprosomatostatin has a sequence of hydrophobic amino acids at the NH2 terminus, followed by a peptide of approximately 78 residues, which precedes somatostatin-14. The amino acid sequences of rat and human preprosomatostatin (Shen, L. P., Pictet, R. L., and Rutter, W. J. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 79, 4575-4579) differ by only 4 amino acid residues. Translation of rat poly(A) RNA in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system followed by immunoprecipitation with antisera directed against somatostatin-14 demonstrated the synthesis of a single protein having a molecular weight of 15,000. Two proteins having molecular weights of 14,000 and 15,000 are immunoprecipitated from a wheat germ cell-free translation mixture. Northern analysis of the somatostatin mRNA indicated that it is approximately 850 nucleotides in length. Analysis of several medullary thyroid carcinomas demonstrated that one tumor, designated WF, had immunoreactive somatostatin-14 in concentrations of 350 ng of somatostatin-14/mg of protein and somatostatin mRNA that represented 10% of the cellular poly(A) RNA. Cell lines derived from this tumor may provide an attractive system to investigate the regulation of somatostatin gene expression."
"6143322","articletitle","Changes in rat liver metallothionein and metallothionein mRNA induced by isopropanol."
"6143322","abstracttext","Administration of isopropanol (1 ml/kg body weight) via the ip route significantly depressed the serum zinc concentration within 8 hr. A maximal increase in hepatic metallothionein was observed 16 hr after isopropanol. By 48 hr after treatment metallothionein levels in liver had returned to basal levels. The extent of metallothionein induction was comparable with that observed after ip administration of zinc. Plasma glucagon concentrations were significantly elevated 4 hr after isopropanol treatment. Adrenalectomy did not prevent the isopropanol-induced changes in serum zinc or hepatic metallothionein. This suggests a nonadrenal mechanism is responsible for the observed changes. To evaluate changes in metallothionein mRNA levels in liver, in vitro translation with the wheat germ system was used to evaluate translational activity. Analysis of the labeled metallothionein produced in vitro employed both covalent chromatography as well as SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of carboxymethylated translation products. These methods suggested the maximum metallothionein mRNA level in total RNA extract occurred about 8 hr after administration of isopropanol. Similarly, when metallothionein mRNA levels were quantitated using dot blot hybridization to [32P]cDNA for mouse metallothionein I, maximum metallothionein mRNA appeared 8 hr after isopropanol administration. The overall response of these parameters in rats suggest that isopropanol administration leads to an inflammatory-like response that, with respect to zinc metabolism, has elements which are independent of the adrenal gland, but involve transcriptional regulation of the metallothionein gene in liver."
"1374389","articletitle","Beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase: a short NH2-terminal fragment that includes the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain is sufficient for Golgi retention."
"1374389","abstracttext","Beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta 1,4-GT) is a Golgi-resident, type II membrane-bound glycoprotein that functions in the coordinate biosynthesis of complex oligosaccharides. Additionally, beta 1,4-GT has been localized to the cell surface of a variety of cell types and tissues where it is proposed to function in intercellular recognition and/or adhesion. Thus beta 1,4-GT is an appropriate molecule to be used in analyzing the molecular basis for retention of a membrane-bound enzyme in the Golgi complex and its subsequent or alternative transport to the cell surface. Previously we have shown that the gene for bovine and murine beta 1,4-GT is unusual in that it specifies a short (SGT) and long (LGT) form of the enzyme (Russo, R. N., Shaper, N. L., and Shaper, J. H. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 3324-3331). The only difference between the two related forms is in the primary structure of the cytoplasmic domains, where LGT has an NH2-terminal extension of 13 amino acids. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that LGT and SGT are differentially retained in the Golgi or directed to the cell surface. LGT, SGT or chimeric proteins, containing the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain of SGT and LGT fused to the cytoplasmic protein pyruvate kinase, were each stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Proteins expressed from each construct were localized by immunofluorescence staining exclusively to a perinuclear region, identified as the Golgi by co-localization with wheat germ agglutinin. Furthermore, the subcellular distribution of both SGT and LGT was restricted to the trans-Golgi compartment as assessed by EM immunoelectron microscopy. These data suggest that both forms of beta 1,4-GT are resident trans-Golgi proteins and that an NH2-terminal segment containing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of SGT (39 amino acids) or LGT (52 amino acids) is sufficient for Golgi retention."
"1302052","articletitle","Late embryogenesis-abundant genes encoding proteins with different numbers of hydrophilic repeats are regulated differentially by abscisic acid and osmotic stress."
"1302052","abstracttext","The late embryogenesis-abundant (Lea) genes, which are suggested to act as desiccation protectants during seed desiccation and in water-stressed seedlings, can be induced by abscisic acid (ABA) and various kinds of water-related stress. Using cotton Lea cDNAs as probes it was found that several of the Lea genes are conserved at the mRNA level in dicots and monocots. By screening a barley cDNA library with a cotton Lea D19 cDNA a family of three members was isolated. The putative B19 proteins have strong similarities to the Em protein in wheat and to LEA proteins from several dicots. However, the middle part of the B19 proteins consists of a 20-amino acid motif repeated three and four times in B19.3 and B19.4, respectively, but only once in B19.1. The gene products are strongly hydrophilic, the internal 20-amino acid motif being the most hydrophilic part. This motif is found once in cotton Lea D19 but is repeated twice in cotton Lea D132, indicating that the repeats are universal among monocot and dicot B19-like genes. The B19 genes are regulated similarly during embryo development, but to very different levels. In contrast, they are differentially regulated by ABA and various types of osmotic stress. In immature embryos all three genes are responsive to ABA and mannitol. However, B19.1 is also responsive to salt. Cold stress does not induce B19 mRNAs; only a stabilization of the transcript levels is seen. These results suggest that the responses to salt stress and exogenous ABA operate through different pathways."
"1392595","articletitle","A novel light-regulated promoter is conserved in cereal and dicot chloroplasts."
"1392595","abstracttext","The chloroplast psbD-psbC genes encode D2 and cp43, a reaction center protein and chlorophyll-binding antenna protein of photosystem II, respectively. We have previously shown that differential accumulation of light-induced psbD-psbC mRNAs in barley chloroplasts is due to transcription from a blue light-responsive promoter (LRP). It is hypothesized that the light-induced mRNAs help to maintain levels of the D2 polypeptide, which is photodamaged and degraded in illuminated plants. To determine if light-induced accumulation of psbD-psbC mRNAs was a conserved phenomenon in chloroplasts, the expression of psbD-psbC operons from five cereals (barley, wheat, rice, maize, and sorghum) and three dicot (tobacco, spinach, and pea) species was examined. Cereal and dicot psbD-psbC operons differ due to several DNA rearrangements that moved psbK-psbI proximal to psbD-psbC, allowing cotranscription of these genes and production of several unique transcripts in cereals. Despite differences in the structure and expression of the cereal and dicot psbD-psbC operons, the accumulation of light-induced psbD-psbC mRNAs was conserved in all species studied. An unusual feature of the light-induced mRNAs was the occurrence of 5' end microheterogeneity. The multiple 5' termini were mapped to several consecutive nucleotides (8 to 25 bp) within a highly conserved (61%) DNA region that represents the transcription initiation site for the mRNAs in barley and tobacco. The novel LRP differs in sequence from typical plastid promoters that have prokaryotic ""-10"" and ""-35"" elements and is centered 570 bp (cereals), 900 bp (tobacco, spinach), or 1100 bp (pea) upstream from the psbD translational start codon. We propose that physiological and gene regulatory demands of the chloroplast act as constraints that preserved the linkage of the LRP with psbD despite DNA inversions involving the psbD upstream region."
"1453447","articletitle","Folding on the ribosome of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase beta subunit nascent chains probed with a conformation-dependent monoclonal antibody."
"1453447","abstracttext","Experimental analysis of protein folding during protein synthesis on the ribosome is rendered very difficult by the low concentration of nascent polypeptides and the heterogeneity of the translation mixture. In this study, an original approach is developed for analysing nascent polypeptide structures still carried by the ribosome. Folding on the ribosome of nascent chains of the beta subunit of Escherichia coli tryptophan synthase was investigated using a monoclonal antibody (mAb 19) recognizing a conformation-dependent antigenic determinant. Upon synthesis of beta subunits in an E. coli coupled transcription-translation system, it is shown that ribosome-bound nascent polypeptides can react with the monoclonal antibody provided their size is above 11.5 kDa, which is smaller than that of both the N-terminal proteolytic and crystallographic domains (29 and 21 kDa, respectively). The gene fragments coding only for the 11.5 kDa polypeptide, with and without stop codon at the end of the corresponding mRNAs, were constructed and expressed in a cell-free wheat germ translation system. It is shown that antibody 19 reacts with this polypeptide either bound to the ribosome or free in solution. That the 11.5 kDa polypeptide acquires a condensed structure is shown by gel filtration in native conditions and by urea gradient gel electrophoresis. Moreover, it is demonstrated that this condensed structure resembles that of native beta 2 in the vicinity of the epitope for antibody 19. Indeed, the affinity of antibody 19 for the 11.5 kDa fragment, either free or bound to the ribosome, was measured (6 x 10(8) M-1) and shown to be close to that for native beta 2. It is therefore proposed that the polypeptide chain may start to fold during its biosynthesis and that, even before the appearance of an entire domain, a folded intermediate is formed that already exhibits some local structural features of the native state and of an immunoreactive intermediate previously detected during the in vitro refolding of denatured complete beta chains."

"1461724","abstracttext","We have previously isolated and sequenced Nicotiana cytoplasmic tRNA(Tyr) with G psi A anticodon which promotes readthrough over the leaky UAG termination codon at the end of the 126 K cistron of tobacco mosaic virus RNA and we have demonstrated that tRNA(Tyr) with Q psi A anticodon is no UAG suppressor. Here we show that the nucleotide in the middle of the anticodon (i.e., psi 35) also contributes to the suppressor efficiency displayed by cytoplasmic tRNA(Tyr). A tRNA(Tyr) with GUA anticodon was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase transcription. This tRNA(Tyr) was unable to suppress the UAG codon, indicating that nucleotide modifications in the anticodon of tRNA(Tyr) have either stimulating (i.e., psi 35) or inhibitory (i.e., Q34) effects on suppressor activity. Furthermore, we have shown that the UAA but not the UGA stop codon is also efficiently recognized by tobacco tRNA(G psi ATyr), if placed in the TMV context. Hence this is the first naturally occurring tRNA for which UAA suppressor activity has been demonstrated. In order to study the influence of neighbouring nucleotides on the readthrough capacity of tRNA(Tyr), we have established a system, in which part of the sequence around the leaky UAG codon of TMV RNA was inserted into a zein pseudogene which naturally harbours an UAG codon in the middle of the gene. The construct was cloned into the vector pSP65 and in vitro transcripts, generated by SP6 RNA polymerase, were translated in a wheat germ extract depleted of endogenous mRNAs and tRNAs. A number of mutations in the codons flanking the UAG were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. It was found that changes at specific positions of the two downstream codons completely abolished the readthrough over the UAG by Nicotiana tRNA(Tyr), indicating that this tRNA needs a very specific codon context for its suppressor activity."

"1529532","abstracttext","We have determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the largest segment S1 of rice dwarf phytoreovirus (RDV), a member of the family Reoviridae. S1 is 4423 nucleotides long with a segment-specific inverted repeat located adjacent to the conserved termini (5'GGCAAA---UGAU3'). A major open reading frame (bases 36 to 4367) on the S1 plus strand, which is preceded by a minicistron (bases 6 to 29), encodes the polypeptide (P1) consisting of 1444 amino acids with a M(r) of 164, 142. The sense-strand transcript derived from the full-length S1 cDNA, the minicistron of which was abolished, directed the synthesis of a polypeptide of 170 kDa in addition to smaller polypeptides in wheat germ extracts, and the 170-kDa product comigrated with the minor core protein in SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Thus, P1 is assumed to be localized in the viral core particle. The consensus sequence element conserved in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is observed in the P1 amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence. Based on the dendrogram established from the sequence alignment around the polymerase module region, and sequence identity within the alignment, P1 of plant-infecting RDV was evolutionarily compared with VP1, lambda 3, and VP1 of three other animal-infecting members of the family, rota-, reo-, and bluetongue viruses. Consequently, RDV S1 was shown to be more closely related to the rotavirus gene segment 1, in terms of molecular evolution, than the animal-infecting members are to one another."

The C. eugametos mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a 24 kb circular map and is thus 2 kb larger than the 22 kb circular mitochondrial genome of C. moewusii. Restriction mapping and heterologous, fragment hybridization experiments indicate that the C. eugametos and C. moewusii mtDNAs are colinear. Nine cross-hybridizing restriction fragments common to the C. eugametos and C. moewusii mtDNAs, and spanning the entirely of these genomes, show length differences between homologous fragments which vary from 0.1 to 2.3 kb. A 600 bp subfragment of C. moewusii mtDNA, within one of these conserved fragments, showed no hybridization with the C. eugametos mtDNA. Of the 73 restriction sites identified in the C. eugametos and C. moewusii mtDNAs, five are specific to C. moewusii, eight are specific to C. eugametos and 30 are common to both species. Hybridization experiments with gene probes derived from protein-coding and ribosomal RNA-coding regions of wheat and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii mtDNAs support the view that the small and large subunit ribosomal RNA-coding regions of the C. eugametos and C. moewusii mtDNAs are interrupted and interspersed with each other and with protein-coding regions, as are the ribosomal RNA-coding regions of C. reinhardtii mtDNA; however, the specific arrangement of these coding elements in the C. eugametos and C. moewusii mtDNAs appears different from that of C. reinhardtii mtDNA."

"1511135","abstracttext","Binding of nuclear proteins from wild oat aleurone protoplasts to the promoter regions of two gibberellin-regulated wheat alpha-amylase genes (alpha-Amy1/18 and alpha-Amy2/54) has been studied by gel retardation and DNase 1 footprinting. Gel retardation studies using 300-430 bp fragments of the promoters showed similar binding characteristics with nuclear extracts from both gibberellin A1-treated and untreated protoplasts. DNase 1 footprints localised binding of nuclear proteins from gibberellin A1-treated aleurone protoplasts to regions in both promoters. Similar sequence elements in the promoter regions of both genes were protected from digestion although the location and number of footprints in each promoter region were different. Each footprint contained either a sequence similar to the cAMP and/or phorbol ester response elements, or a hyphenated palindrome sequence. The presence of cAMP and/or phorbol ester response element-like sequences in the footprints suggests that transcription factors of the bZIP type may be involved in the expression of alpha-amylase genes in aleurone cells. Footprints containing hyphenated palindrome sequences, found in the promoter regions of both genes, suggest the possible involvement of other classes of transcription factor. The conserved alpha-amylase promoter sequence TAA-CAGA was also shown to bind nuclear protein in the alpha-Amy2/54 promoter. These observations are discussed in relation to alpha-amylase gene expression in aleurone and to functional data concerning these genes."

"480453","abstracttext","The early and late gene products of human adenovirus type 12 (Ad12), as well as the viral proteins synthesized in an Ad12-transformed cell line, were identified by translation of viral mRNA in an in vitro protein-synthesizing system. Cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from permissive KB or nonpermissive BHK cells infected with Ad12 and from Ad12-transformed HA12/7 cells. Virus-specific RNA was selected by hybridization to Ad12 DNA covalently bound to cellulose. Viral RNA was then translated in a fractionated rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system or in wheat germ S-30 extracts. The proteins synthesized were characterized by immunoprecipitation and subsequent electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. RNA prepared from KB cells late after infection with Ad12 elicited the synthesis of most of the structural polypeptides of the virion and at least two presumably nonstructural Ad12 proteins. When viral RNA isolated early after infection of KB cells with Ad12 was translated in vitro, 10 polypeptides were observed: E-68K, E-50K, E-42K, E-39K, E-34K, E-21K, E-19K, E-13K, E-12K, and E-10K. Ad12-specific RNA was also isolated from the Ad12-transformed hamster cell line HA12/7, which contains several copies of the Ad12 genome integrated in the host genome. The RNA codes for at least seven polypeptides with molecular weights very similar to those of the early viral proteins."

"487433","abstracttext","The programmed de novo synthesis of flagellar tubulin during the hour-long differentiation of Naegleria gruberi from amoebae to flagellates is our paradigm for the study of gene expression during cell differentiation. This paper reports the efficient translation of flagellar tubulin mRNA in the wheat germ cell-free system directed by total or polyadenylated RNA extracted from differentiating cells. The tubulin in the in vitro product has a subunit molecular weight of 55,000, separates into alpha and beta subunits under suitable conditions of polyacrylamide gel electrophoreis and co-polymerizes with calf brain tubulin. At least half of the tubulin synthesized in vitro is precipitated by antibodies specific to flagellar tubulin, and the immunoprecipitated tubulin subunits yield peptide maps similar to those of outer doublet tublin. Flagellar tubulin is the predominant protein synthesized in the cell-free system, and amounts to about 5% of the polypeptides whose synthesis is directed by total RNA from differentiating cells. In contrast, little or no flagellar tubulin is synthesized when the cell-free system is directed by RNA extracted from amoebae prior to differentiation. Translation assays show that at least 92% of the flagellar tubulin mRNA appears during differentiation. The time course of appearance of this mRNA was measured by quantitative immunoprecipitation of the cell-free products. Under conditions where cells from flagella 60 min after initiation of differentiation, translatable flagellar tubulin mRNA was first detected at 20 min, reached a maximum at about 60 min and then declined. An excellent correlation was observed between the amount of translatable flagellar tubulin mRNA and the previously measured rates of flagellar tubulin synthesis in vivo. These results indicate that synthesis of flagellar tubulin is a direct reflection of the abundance of its mRNA, and provide the molecular techniques for dissection of the factors that regulate the rapid appearance of this structural protein during differentiation."

"3049602","abstracttext","We have used an in vitro transcription-translation system to study initial protein processing events of the rat substance P/neurokinin A gene products. cDNA clones for three different mRNA species, which are derived by differential RNA splicing, were subcloned into a plasmid, pGEM1, which contains the promoter for the bacteriophage SP6 RNA polymerase. In vitro synthesized mRNAs for alpha-, beta-, and gamma-preprotachykinin were translated in a wheat germ or rabbit reticulocyte cell-free system. When analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the translated protein products migrate consistent with the deduced molecular masses of alpha (13,035 Da)-, beta (15,003 Da)-, and gamma (13,343 Da)-preprotachykinin. The addition of dog pancreatic microsomal membranes to either cell-free translation system causes the production of a protease-resistant form of each of the three preprotachykinins which migrates with an apparent increase in molecular mass of approximately 2,000 Da. Each of these modified preprotachykinins lacks the putative signal peptide of the prepro- form, with signal peptidase cleavage occurring after the alanine residue at position 19. Both the prepro- and proforms of each tachykinin precursor molecule are recognized by antiserum R-140, an antiserum specific for the mid-portion of the undecapeptide substance P. The most likely explanation for the apparent increase in molecular mass is anomalous electrophoretic migration, since beta-preprotachykinin mRNA lacking the signal peptide encoding sequence is translated, in the absence of microsomal membranes, into a protein with the same apparent molecular mass as the modified form of beta-preprotachykinin. Therefore, each of the three preprotachykinin mRNAs are translatable, and their products are targeted to the secretory pathway by the presence of a cleavable signal peptide."

The assay developed is based on a three-step procedure: (1) incubation of pre-mRNA with HeLa-cell nuclear extract in the presence of ATP; (2) incorporation of 3H-labelled amino acid into proteins by wheat-germ extract by using RNA from step 1; and (3) immunoprecipitation of globin chains with rabbit anti-(mouse globin) antibody. No incorporation of label into immune complexes was observed in the absence of HeLa-cell extract or ATP. Preincubation with these components was unnecessary for the incorporation of label into immune complexes when mature cytoplasmic RNA was used as a template for protein synthesis. The assay was further validated by fluorography after polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, when the only band detectable corresponded to globin chains. These results demonstrate, for the first time, translational activity of transcripts spliced in vitro. The current assay can be utilized with a few micrograms of pre-mRNA and may have potential for further characterization of the splicing system."
"2463274","articletitle","Organization of spinocerebellar projection map in three types of agranular cerebellum: Purkinje cells vs. granule cells as organizer element."
"2463274","abstracttext","The organization of the spinocerebellar projection was analysed by the anterograde axonal WGA-HRP (horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin conjugate) tracing method in three different types of agranular cerebellar cortex either induced experimentally by X-irradiation or occurring spontaneously in weaver (wv/wv) and staggerer (sg/sg) mutant mice. The results of this study show that in the X-irradiated rat and weaver mouse, in both of which the granule cells are directly affected and die early in development, the spinal axons reproduce, with few differences, the normal spinocerebellar pattern. Conversely, in staggerer mouse, in which the Purkinje cells are intrinsically affected and granule neurons do not seem to be primarily perturbed by the staggerer gene action, the spinocerebellar organization is severely modified. These findings appear somewhat paradoxical because if granule cells, the synaptic targets of mossy spinocerebellar fibers, were necessary for the organization of spinocerebellar projection, the staggerer cerebellum would exhibit a much more normal projectional map than the weaver and the X-irradiated cerebella. It is, therefore, obvious that granule cells, and even specific synaptogenesis, are not essential for the establishment of the normal spinocerebellar topography. On the other hand, the fact that the Purkinje cells are primarily affected in the unique agranular cortex in which the spinocerebellar organization is severely modified suggests that these neurons could be the main element in the organization of the spinocerebellar projection map. This hypothesis is discussed in correlation with already-reported findings on the zonation of the cerebellar cortex by biochemically different clusters of Purkinje cells."
"2483837","articletitle","Synthesis of cytokeratin 13, a component characteristic of internal stratified epithelia, is not induced in human epidermal tumors."
"2483837","abstracttext","Human cytokeratin 13 is one of the most abundant intermediate filament (IF) proteins of many internal stratified epithelia and occurs, at least in certain cell cultures, in an O-glycosylated form binding the lectin, wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). As other groups have reported that, in the mouse, the synthesis of mRNA encoding the 47-kDa cytokeratin corresponding to human cytokeratin 13 is induced in epidermal keratinocytes during malignant transformation, we have examined the synthesis of cytokeratin 13 mRNA and protein in human epidermis and epidermal tumors, using specific cDNA probes and cytokeratin 13 antibodies. We isolated two different cDNA clones from the vulvar carcinoma cell line A-431, in which this protein is abundant: One clone seems to represent the entire mRNA, whereas the other is only a minor component and encodes a truncated cytokeratin 13 lacking most of the carboxy-terminal tail domain, probably a product of alternative, ""incorrect"" splicing. Comparison of the amino acid sequences with those of other cytokeratins revealed a high degree of conservation with respect to several other human type I cytokeratins, notably cytokeratin 15, and to the murine 47-kDa cytokeratin. When human epidermis and a series of benign and malignant epidermal tumors were examined with these cDNA probes and cytokeratin-13-specific antibodies we did not find an induction of expression in keratinocytes, normal or malignantly transformed, except for some scattered, sparse cytokeratin-13-positive cells and very low levels of cytokeratin 13 mRNA, detectable only with the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We conclude that the gene(s) encoding cytokeratin 13 are not induced in human keratinocytes during epidermal carcinogenesis, in apparent contrast to reports of murine epidermal tumors, and we discuss possible explanations for this interspecies difference."
"2666829","articletitle","Prolactin, human nutrition and evolution, and the relation to cystic fibrosis."
"2666829","abstracttext","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a lethal, genetically transmitted disease of Caucasian populations. Its prevalence is highest (ca 1:2000 live births) among Western and Central Europeans and their descendants. Major clinical symptoms are chronic, obstructive, pulmonary disease, impaired intestinal digestion and absorption and elevated concentration of salt in sweat. The last is important, not only for diagnosis, but because it is an example of an electrolyte transport defect present in other epithelial tissues. Numerous other clinical manifestations are generally present. The history of prolactin (PRL), especially its role in osmoregulation, is outlined and related to the symptomatology and electrolyte defect of CF. Data are presented showing the relation of PRL to regulation of sweat electrolytes and its presence and probable synthesis in the coil of the human sweat gland. The basic biochemical defect of CF has not yet been elucidated, but recent research has shown that it is probably an abnormality of a regulatory factor. We propose that PRL is a likely candidate. The large variety of functions of PRL, in particular the regulation of the transport of sodium and chloride across epithelial membranes, and the regulation of mucus production, can be matched to the major disease symptomatology. Additionally, every other one of the multiple abnormalities of CF can be associated with described activities of PRL. In lower vertebrates epithelial tissues regulated by PRL are phylogenetic progenitors of affected tissues in CF. In the human, these tissues contain cells of the Diffuse Neuroendocrine System, or APUD cells, that show PRL-like immunoreactivity, or overt synthesis of the hormone. Thus, the regulatory activity of these tissues could be paracrine. The geographic distribution and the dietary habits of early Caucasians are examined. It appears that the Neolithic revolution, with the necessity of adapting to agriculturally produced foods, i.e. milk and wheat, could have brought about the genetic selection of post-translational variants of PRL. It is suggested that the combination of two or more of these mutations in the same individual may be responsible for CF. This is illustrated with proposed models of CF inheritance. We conclude by postulating that PRL acts at the level of the target cell by triggering (in conjunction with a steroid) the gene expression of unique proteins; these act as intermediaries of PRL activity; two or more abnormalities of these proteins when present in an individual produce CF; the protein abnormalities are the consequence of nutritional and ecological pressure."

"3882705","abstracttext","Cytoplasmic elongation factor 1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) was purified to homogeneity from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae using a large-scale procedure. The three steps of purification used were batch adsorption on phosphocellulose, phosphocellulose chromatography and, as the last step, GDP-Sepharose or Biorex column chromatography. The protein is very basic (pI = 9.2) and has an apparent molecular mass of 49 kDa, as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using denaturing conditions. It is one of the most abundant proteins in yeast (about 5% of total soluble protein), as shown by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and by immunological titration. A strong immunological and structural homology was found between yeast EF-1 alpha and elongation factors from other sources. Common immunological features were found between yeast and wheat germ EF-1 alpha. Tryptic hydrolysis of yeast EF-1 alpha in the presence of 25% glycerol generated a large trypsin-resistant polypeptide (Mr = 43,000) which had the same NH2-terminal sequence as the proteolyzed product from rabbit reticulocyte, Artemia salina EF-1 alpha and Escherichia coli EF-Tu. Completed DNA sequence determination of one structural gene for yeast EF-1 alpha confirmed a remarkable conservation of several protein sequence domains in yeast and animal EF-1 alpha (Cottrelle, P., Thiele, D., Price, V., Memet, S., Micouin, J.Y., Marck, C., Buhler, J.M.

"3855753","articletitle","The cell specificity and biosynthesis of mouse glycophorins studied with monoclonal antibodies."
"3855753","abstracttext","Murine erythropoiesis represents a favourable system in which to investigate the coordinate regulation of gene expression due to the availability of erythroid precursor cells at various stages of differentiation. In this report, we investigate the biosynthesis and cell specificity of two characteristic murine RBC membrane glycoproteins that resemble the human RBC glycophorins: a major component of apparent molecular mass 31 kD (glycophorin MA) and a minor 46 kD component (glycophorin MB). Both glycophorins bind to wheat germ lectin and share a common protein antigenic determinant recognised by a monoclonal antibody (GP 29.4), but they differ significantly in their carbohydrate components: whilst both glycophorins contain mainly O-linked sugars, glycophorin MA contains in addition at least one N-linked carbohydrate residue and terminal sialic acid residues. Pulse-chase in vivo labelling experiments combined with in vitro translations of glycophorin mRNAs show that the initial precursor to glycophorin MA is a 24.5 kD polypeptide which is subsequently processed and glycosylated to give the mature 31 kD molecule via a 21.5 kD polypeptide intermediate. Both glycophorins MA and MB are synthesized most actively in early to mid erythroblasts (e.g., Friend cells induced for 3 days with DMSO) but their synthesis is considerably reduced by the reticulocyte stage. However, of the other cell types tested (neuroblastoma, myeloma, fibroblasts, epithelial cells and T-lymphoma cells), none synthesizes glycophorin with the possible exception of a low level in thymus tissue. Thus murine glycophorins, in contrast to the RBC cytoskeletal proteins (spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.1) seem to be restricted to the erythroid cell lineage like human glycophorin."
"2154495","articletitle","Purification and properties of a novel insulin-like growth factor-II binding protein from transformed human fibroblasts."
"2154495","abstracttext","We have purified an insulin-like growth factor (IGF) binding protein from culture medium conditioned by the SV40-transformed human fibroblast line AG 2804. This protein (TFBP), of apparent Mr = 34,000 on gel electrophoresis, binds IGF-II with an affinity constant of 3 x 10(11) liters/mol, 100-fold higher than its affinity for IGF-I. Amino-terminal sequencing indicated no structural relationship to any previously characterized IGF binding protein or receptor. Like a protein in cerebrospinal fluid with selective affinity for IGF-II, TFBP does not bind IGF-I lacking the amino-terminal tripeptide. In contrast with binding proteins produced by normal human fibroblasts, TFBP does not cross-react in radioimmunoassays for the plasma protein IGFBP-3 or the amniotic fluid protein IGFBP-1; however, after affinity labeling with IGF-II, it is immunoprecipitable by an anti-IGFBP-3 antiserum. The cerebrospinal fluid binding protein is not precipitable by this antiserum and appears smaller than TFBP. TFBP reacts with wheat germ agglutinin, but not with concanavalin A, or with the acid-labile subunit of the high molecular weight serum IGF binding protein complex. Furthermore, since RNA from transformed fibroblasts does not hybridize with an IGFBP-3 cDNA probe, TFBP is not derived from the IGFBP-3 gene. We conclude that, although TFBP appears to share an epitope with IGFBP-3, it is distinctly different from any previously described IGF binding protein."
"2156825","articletitle","Amplified expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor in cells transfected with Epstein-Barr virus shuttle vector cDNA libraries."
"2156825","abstracttext","As an approach to isolate the cell-surface receptor for tumor necrosis factor (TNF), we have developed transfectants of human B-lymphoblastoid cells (UC cells) that overexpress the TNF receptor. These transfectants were isolated from UC cells transfected with cDNA libraries of HeLa or NG108 cells constructed in the mammalian expression vector EBO-pcD. This vector contains the Epstein-Barr virus origin of replication (ori-P) plus the EBNA-1 gene conferring replication function to ori-P and, therefore, the ability to replicate autonomously within the transfected cell (Margolskee, R.F., Kavathas, P., and Berg, P. (1988) Mol. Cell. Biol. 8, 2837-2947). Cells overexpressing the TNF receptor were identified and separated by the binding of fluoresceinated TNF and flow cytometric selection. Scatchard analysis of 125I-TNF binding data revealed a single class of high affinity receptors with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.2 to 2 nM and a receptor density of about 150,000 per cell, an increase of approximately 150-fold over UC cells. Cross-linking of receptor-ligand with bis-sulfosuccinimidyl suberate followed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gave estimates of 87 and 104 kDa for the size of the complex. Based on its ability to bind TNF, a 68-kDa receptor protein was identified in cell extracts enriched for the receptor by using immobilized wheat germ agglutinin and TNF affinity chromatography. The difference in the estimated size of the receptor and the receptor-ligand complexes demonstrates that TNF binds to the receptor as a monomer or a dimer. Analysis of cDNA sequences conferring receptor amplification in transfectants revealed that plasmid DNA was present at 30 or more copies per cell, most likely integrated into the genomic DNA or organized into high molecular weight catenanes, and autonomously replicating units could not be recovered. Therefore, while this vector was useful in generating stable receptor-amplified cells, it was not maintained as a recoverable episome."
"1694173","articletitle","Purification and functional characterization of integrin alpha v beta 5. An adhesion receptor for vitronectin."
"1694173","abstracttext","We have purified a novel member of the integrin gene family from placenta that serves as a vitronectin receptor. This integrin is composed of the alpha v subunit and a beta subunit that we designate beta 5. Purification was accomplished by immunodepleting a placental extract of integrin alpha v beta 3, allowing us to purify alpha v beta 5 from the remaining extract by monoclonal antibody affinity chromatography on LM 142-Sepharose, which binds to the alpha v subunit. Purification to homogeneity was subsequently achieved by affinity chromatography on wheat germ lectin-Sepharose. Western blot analysis with antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 and alpha v beta 3 demonstrated that beta 3 and beta 5 were distinct but confirmed that the alpha subunit of the two integrins were immunologically identical. Similarly, antibodies that bind beta 3 proximal to the ligand-binding site failed to react with beta 5, indicating an architectural difference at the ligand-binding site of these related integrins. This structural difference apparently results in a functional distinction, since purified alpha v beta 3 bound to vitronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, and fibronectin, whereas integrin alpha v beta 5 bound preferentially to vitronectin. Finally, we demonstrate by three criteria that beta 5 and beta x, the latter of which was identified in lung carcinoma cells (Cheresh, D. A., Smith, J. W., Cooper, H. M., and Quaranta, V. (1989) Cell 57, 59-69), are identical. First, peptide maps of beta x and beta 5 are identical. Secondly, polyclonal antibodies raised against alpha v beta 5 immunoprecipitate both beta 5 and beta x, and finally, the amino-terminal amino acid sequences of beta x and beta 5 are identical."

"2166126","abstracttext","The effects of the recessive and sex-linked dw gene on insulin sensitivity and liver insulin receptors were compared in normal (Dw-dw) and dwarf (dw-dw) brother or half-brother chickens. At 3.5 weeks of age, following an overnight fast, exogenous insulin (0-6.9 nmol/kg body weight) was slightly but significantly more hypoglycaemic in dwarf chickens. At 4 weeks of age, following an oral glucose load (2 g/kg), glucose tolerance was the same in both genotypes, whereas plasma insulin levels were greatly decreased in dwarf chickens. At 5 weeks of age, plasma concentrations of glucose and insulin were the same in both genotypes in the fasting state and decreased in the fed state in dwarf chickens. In liver membranes prepared from fasted chickens, insulin binding was increased in dwarf chickens, while the affinity of insulin receptors and the insulin-degrading activity of the membranes were the same in both genotypes. Following solubilization with Triton X-100, liver receptors were successively purified on lentil then wheat germ lectins. Autophosphorylation of the beta-subunit did not differ between either the genotype or the nutritional (fed or fasted) state. In the basal state (in the absence of insulin) the tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor towards artificial substrate poly(Glu, Tyr)4:1 was significantly decreased in dwarf chickens by fasting. However, the change in tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor in response to insulin was similar, irrespective of the genotype and the nutritional state.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"2168890","articletitle","Acidic fibroblast growth factor receptor purified from bovine liver is a novel protein tyrosine kinase."
"2168890","abstracttext","Acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF) receptor was purified from plasma membranes of bovine liver using Triton X-100 extraction, wheat germ lectin-Sepharose 4B gel affinity chromatography, and DEAE-cellulose anion-exchange chromatography. As previously reported for the aFGF receptor in murine fibroblasts (Huang, S. S., and Huang, J. S. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9568-9571), the purified aFGF receptor was also found to be a 135-kDa glycoprotein which showed an intrinsic and ligand-stimulated autophosphorylation activity. The 32P-labeled aFGF receptor was specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-FGF receptor (anti-flg/bek/cek gene product) antiserum. In contrast to other growth factor receptors/protein tyrosine kinases, the protein tyrosine kinase activity (autophosphorylation) of the aFGF receptor was stimulated (approximately 1.5-fold) by low concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, and Ca2+ (optimal concentrations of approximately 0.1, approximately 0.1, and 1 microM, respectively) but inhibited by higher concentrations of Mn2+, Mg2+, Ca2+, and pyrophosphate (greater than or equal to 20, greater than or equal to 50, greater than or equal to 10, and greater than or equal to 100 microM, respectively). However, addition of Mn2+ and pyrophosphate at a ratio of 1:1 not only reversed the inhibitory effect but also enhanced the kinase activity about 3-4-fold. The apparent Km of ATP for intrinsic and ligand-stimulated protein kinase activity of the aFGF receptor was estimated to be 25 microM. The preferred exogenous substrates for the protein tyrosine kinase activity of the aFGF receptor were found to be myelin basic protein and histone. Poly-L-arginine, an inhibitor for aFGF binding to the receptor, appeared to stimulate the mitogenesis or cell growth of responsive cells by mimicking aFGF activity."

"1714465","abstracttext","Methods involving the anterograde and retrograde transport of wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase and the retrograde transport of Fluoro-Gold were used in rats to examine the distribution within the spinal trigeminal nucleus of trigeminal neurons projecting to the nucleus submedius (Sm) of the thalamus, as well as the distribution of axon terminals within the Sm. Following injections into the trigeminal nucleus, axon terminals were seen in the dorsal part of the anterior Sm; the terminals occurred bilaterally but had an obvious contralateral dominance. To help determine the precise location of the Sm-petal neurons, the border between trigeminal subnuclei interpolaris and caudalis was examined by the use of immunohistochemical procedures for calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The Sm-petal neurons that were labeled retrogradely occurred only at the caudal interpolaris and rostral caudalis levels; the number of labeled neurons on the contralateral side was approximately six times that on the ipsilateral side. Most of these neurons were located in the ventral part of the caudal interpolaris and rostral caudalis and spinal trigeminal tract; in caudalis, the neurons were almost exclusively localized to its superficial layers. There were approximately three times more labeled neurons in interpolaris than in caudalis. In the experiments combined with immunohistochemistry for CGRP, many neurons (34%) were seen in proximity to CGRP-like immunopositive fibers. These results suggest that the Sm of the rat receives its orofacial afferent inputs from brainstem neurons that are localized to the caudal interpolaris and rostral caudalis. In view of previous studies that have implicated these three structures in somatosensory function, and in particular nociception, our data point to a role for this direct projection from interpolaris and caudalis to Sm in the central processing of pain."

"2142594","abstracttext","The non-transcribed spacer (NTS) region of the rDNA of Neurospora crassa contains the transcription regulatory sequences. We isolated a 3.4 kb EcoRI fragment from wild type N.crassa rDNA and cloned in the plasmid pBR325 at the EcoRI site. The insert contains the entire NTS region along with the flanking sequences. Nucleotide sequencing of 3592 nt shows many interesting features like: the NTS region is rich in G+C content (65% G+C); it contains the conserved rRNA processing site 6 (with the nucleotide sequence motif GGTGCGAGAACCCGG, from nt residue 226 to 240, a characteristic feature of most eukaryotic rDNA nontranscribed spacer region); and the NTS region also contains the transcription termination site with the representative Sal I box (from nt residue 1469 to 1477). The potential sequences of transcription termination site are located 288 nt downstream from the end of 26S rRNA gene, and another sequence motif CTTCCT (from nt residue 512 to 517) shows similarity with the human transcription termination site T-2 of its pre-rRNA. Nucleotide sequence homology matrix analysis suggests its relatedness to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and not to human, mouse, rat, Drosophila, Xenopus, wheat, rice and cucumber NTS region. The phylogenetic implication of the NTS region and exploitation of N.crassa NTS rDNA clone to correlate the otherwise indistinguishable species of Neurospora and the correlation with other organisms has been discussed. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report where the nucleotide sequence of the entire NTS region of a filamentous fungus has been determined."
"1682499","articletitle","rDNA intergenic region from Arabidopsis thaliana. Structural analysis, intraspecific variation and functional implications."
"1682499","abstracttext","The ribosomal gene intergenic region from Arabidopsis thaliana contains four clusters of mutually unrelated repeated sequences. By comparison with the respective regions in two other Brassicaceae, Raphanus and Sinapis, the putative promoter sequence for RNA polymerase I was located. The homologies suggest that the RNA polymerase I promoter in Brassicaceae ranges further upstream than in animals. Upstream duplications of at least a part of the promoter region were found to be located between individual blocks of the largest internal repeat family (""A"" repeats), which is made up of multiple repeats of two closely related sequences 21 or 20 bp in length. Overall structural similarities of the A. thaliana rDNA intergenic region with those from wheat and from Xenopus laevis are discussed. We also present data on the range of intraspecific length heterogeneities found in the central EcoRI fragment of the intergenic region and on the frequencies with which specific length variants occur in the genome. To determine the nature of the length heterogeneities, we sequenced the central EcoRI fragments from four independently isolated genomic clones. Three levels of rearrangements were detected. Length variation can be caused by duplication of a whole A repeat block, or, most frequently, by insertion and/or deletion of one or a few A repeat units. Surprisingly, single base mutations are extremely rare, which hints at some mechanism of homogenization which might be acting on the intergenic region. A possible function of the described sequences in transcriptional regulation is discussed and will be the aim of further investigations."

"1690722","abstracttext","A cDNA library constructed from poly(A)-rich RNA of the sweet potato tuberous root using a newly developed plasmid vector carrying tac-SP6 promoters was used to identify full length cDNAs for the nuclear-encoded delta-subunit of mitochondrial F1-ATPase by oligonucleotide-hybridization selection. Selected clones contained cDNA insert which carry the entire coding capacity for the pre-delta-subunit, since the RNA transcribed in vitro from SP6 promoter on the vector directed the synthesis of pre-delta-subunit polypeptide in a wheat germ in vitro translation assay. The nucleotide sequence of one of these cDNAs indicates that it can code for the pre-delta-subunit of 244 amino acids of which 199 amino acids encode the mature subunit. The amino acid sequence of the mature delta-subunit shows similarities of about 18-25% amino acid positional identity with the delta-subunits of bacterial F1-ATPases, about 26% with the delta-subunit of chloroplast CF1-ATPase, and about 32-37% with oligomycin sensitivity conferring proteins of animal and fungal mitochondria. The N-terminal presequence of the precursor composed of maximum of 45 amino acids does not show any obvious sequence homology with either the transit peptide of the nuclear-encoded pre-delta-subunit of chloroplast CF1 or the presequence of the nuclear-encoded pre-oligomycin sensitivity conferring proteins. At least two types of the delta-subunit cDNAs with very similar structures were identified from the library, and the presence of multiple copies of the delta-subunit gene in the hexaploid genome of the sweet potato is also suggested by genomic Southern blot hybridization."

Gel filtration chromatography of the native enzyme revealed a Mr of 45,000.

In contrast to the multisubunit beta-galactoside alpha 1----2-fucosyltransferases with an apparent Mr of 150,000, present in human serum, the native beta-N-acetylglucosaminide alpha 1----3-fucosyltransferase is a monomer with a Mr of 45,000. The enzyme is glycosylated, as revealed by wheat germ agglutinin binding properties. The alpha 1----3 linkage formed by the enzyme between alpha-L-fucose and the penultimate beta-N-acetylglucosamine by the purified enzyme was confirmed by 1H NMR homonuclear cross-irradiation analysis of the oligosaccharide product. The specificity of the purified enzyme is restricted to type 2 structures, as revealed by its reactivity with different substrates and from the Km values calculated from the initial rate data using various oligosaccharide acceptors. The enzyme has the ability to utilize the N-acetyl-beta-lactosamine determinant (Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc) and the sialylated (NeuAc alpha 2----3Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc) and fucosylated (Fuc alpha 1----2Gal beta 1----4GlcNAc) derivatives of N-acetyl-beta-lactosamine and thus is distinct from both the human Lewis gene-encoded enzyme and the alpha 1----3-fucosyltransferase of the myeloid cell type."

Immunocytochemical localization of antisera raised against purified glial filament protein (AbGF) and transmission electron microscopy were used to visualize specific associations between granule neurons and astroglia in microcultures of cerebellar cells dissociated from normal (+/+), heterozygous (+/wv), and homozygous (wv/wv) B6CBA-w mouse cerebella. In microcultures of cells dissociated from normal B6CBA-Aw-J-wv (+/+) cerebella, staining with AbGF closely resembled results previously reported for cells taken from C57BL/6J (+/+) tissue. Two forms of stained astroglia were seen, one with a larger perikaryon and shorter processes, among which 12 to 20 unstained cells nestled; and another with a smaller cell soma and longer processes, along which a few unstained cells were seen. The first resembled astrocytes of the internal granular layer and white matter, the second Bergmann astroglia. In microcultures of heterozygous animals (+/wv), the number of granule cells was reduced slightly. Many stained astroglia resembled those from +/+ cerebella, but others had thickened processes and enlarged terminal ""endfeet."" Granule cells associated with both forms of stained astroglia. Cultures from homozygous weaver (wv/wv) cerebella contained very few, if any, granule cells and did not exhibit specific neuronal/glial interactions characteristic of +/+ cells. Both forms of stained wv/wv glial cells had enlarged cell somata giving rise to stunted processes, suggesting that both Bergmann glia and astrocytes are affected by the weaver gene. By both immunocytochemical staining and electron microscopy, accumulation and tangling of glial filaments were seen. Immunocytochemical staining of weaver cerebellar tissue with AbGF also revealed abnormalities in astrocytes of the internal granular layer and white matter in addition to previously reported defects in Bergmann glia. Agglutination with five plant lectins, each with a different carbohydrate-binding specificity, revealed that postnatal weaver cerebellar cells agglutinate with the lectins concanavalin A and the wheat germ agglutinin, suggesting the persistence postnatally of embryonic cell surface elements on postnatal weaver cells."
