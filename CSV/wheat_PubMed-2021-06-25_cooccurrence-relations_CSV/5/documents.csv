"28036107","articletitle","Linkage drag constrains the roots of modern wheat."
"28036107","abstracttext","Roots, the hidden half of crop plants, are essential for resource acquisition. However, knowledge about the genetic control of below-ground plant development in wheat, one of the most important small-grain crops in the world, is very limited. The molecular interactions connecting root and shoot development and growth, and thus modulating the plant's demand for water and nutrients along with its ability to access them, are largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that linkage drag in European bread wheat, driven by strong selection for a haplotype variant controlling heading date, has eliminated a specific combination of two flanking, highly conserved haplotype variants whose interaction confers increased root biomass. Reversing this inadvertent consequence of selection could recover root diversity that may prove essential for future food production in fluctuating environments. Highly conserved synteny to rice across this chromosome segment suggests that adaptive selection has shaped the diversity landscape of this locus across different, globally important cereal crops. By mining wheat gene expression data, we identified root-expressed genes within the region of interest that could help breeders to select positive variants adapted to specific target soil environments."
"29256831","articletitle","Wheat Resistances to Fusarium Root Rot and Head Blight Are Both Associated with Deoxynivalenol- and Jasmonate-Related Gene Expression."
"29256831","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a major pathogen of wheat causing Fusarium head blight (FHB). Its ability to colonize wheat via seedling root infection has been reported recently. Our previous study on Fusarium root rot (FRR) has disclosed histological characteristics of pathogenesis and pathogen defense that mirror processes of spike infection. Therefore, it would be interesting to understand whether genes relevant for FHB resistance are induced in roots. The concept of similar-acting defense mechanisms provides a basis for research at broad Fusarium resistance in crop plants. However, molecular defense responses involved in FRR as well as their relation to spike resistance are unknown. To test the hypothesis of a conserved defense response, a candidate gene expression study was conducted to test the activity of selected prominent FHB defense-related genes in seedling roots, adult plant roots, spikes, and shoots. FRR was examined at seedling and adult plant stages to assess age-related pattern of disease and pathogen resistance. This study offers first evidence for a significant genetic overlap in root and spike defense responses, both in local and distant tissues. The results point to plant development-specific rather than organ-specific determinants of resistance, and suggest roots as an interesting model for studies on wheat-Fusarium interactions."

"29359556","abstracttext","The amount of Zn absorbed from Zn-biofortified wheat material has been determined using an in vivo model of Zn absorption. The erythrocyte linoleic:dihomo -γ-linolenic acid (LA:DGLA) ratio was used as a biomarker of Zn status. Two groups of chickens (n = 15) were fed different diets: a high-Zn (46.5 μg Zn g -1 ) and a low-Zn wheat-based diet (32.8 μg Zn g -1 ). Dietary Zn intakes, body weight, serum Zn, and the erythrocyte fatty acid profile were measured, and tissues were taken for gene expression analysis. Serum Zn concentrations were greater in the high Zn group (p < 0.05). Duodenal mRNA expression of various Zn transporters demonstrated expression upregulation in the birds fed a low Zn diet (n = 15, p < 0.05). The LA:DGLA ratio was higher in the birds fed the low Zn diet (p < 0.05). The higher amount of Zn in the biofortified wheat resulted in a greater Zn uptake."

"29415008","abstracttext","Northern areas of the western United States are one of the most productive wheat growing regions in the United States. Increasing productivity through breeding is hindered by several biotic stresses which slow and constrain targeted yield improvement. In order to understand genetic variation for stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici), Septoria tritici blotch (Mycosphaerella graminicola), and Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) in regional germplasm, a panel of 408 elite spring wheat lines was characterized and genotyped with an Illumina 9K wheat single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) chip to enable genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyses. Significant marker-trait associations were identified for stripe rust (38 loci), Septoria tritici blotch (8) and Hessian fly (9) resistance. Many of the QTL corresponded with previously reported gene locations or QTL, but we also discovered new resistance loci for each trait. We validated one of the stripe rust resistance loci detected by GWAS in a bi-parental mapping population, which confirmed the detection of Yr15 in the panel. This study elucidated well-defined chromosome regions for multiple pest resistances in elite Northwest germplasm. Newly identified resistance loci, along with SNPs more tightly linked to previously reported genes or QTL will help future breeding and marker assisted selection efforts."

"28198421","abstracttext","A semi-comprehensive metabolomics was used to identify the candidate metabolites and genes to decipher mechanisms of resistance in wheat near-isogenic lines (NILs) containing QTL-2DL against Fusarium graminearum (Fg). Metabolites, with high fold-change in abundance, belonging to hydroxycinnamic acid amides (HCAAs): such as coumaroylagmatine, coumaroylputrescine and Fatty acids: phosphatidic acids (PAs) were identified as resistance related induced (RRI) metabolites in rachis of resistant NIL (NIL-R), inoculated with Fg. A WRKY like transcription factor (TF) was identified within the QTL-2DL region, along with three resistance genes that biosynthesized RRI metabolites. Sequencing and in-silico analysis of WRKY confirmed it to be wheat TaWRKY70. Quantitative real time-PCR studies showed a higher expression of TaWRKY70 in NIL-R as compared to NIL-S after Fg inoculation. Further, the functional validation of TaWRKY70 based on virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) in NIL-R, not only confirmed an increased fungal biomass but also decreased expressions of downstream resistance genes: TaACT, TaDGK and TaGLI1, along with decreased abundances of RRI metabolites biosynthesized by them. Among more than 200 FHB resistance QTL identified in wheat, this is the first QTL from which a TF was identified, and its downstream target genes as well as the FHB resistance functions were deciphered."
"28128318","articletitle","Pantoea alhagi, a novel endophytic bacterium with ability to improve growth and drought tolerance in wheat."
"28128318","abstracttext","A novel strain LTYR-11Z T that exhibited multiple plant growth promoting (PGP) traits was isolated from the surface-sterilized leaves of Alhagi sparsifolia Shap. (Leguminosae), which reprsents one of the top drought tolerant plants in north-west China. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and multilocus sequence analysis based on partial sequences of atpD, gyrB, infB and rpoB genes revealed that strain LTYR-11Z T was a member of the genus Pantoea, with Pantoea theicola NBRC 110557 T and Pantoea intestinalis DSM 28113 T as the closest phylogenetic relatives. The results of DNA-DNA hybridization, phenotypic tests and fatty acid analysis confirmed that strain LTYR-11Z T represents a novel species of the genus Pantoea, for which we propose the name Pantoea alhagi sp. nov. Confocal microscopy observation revealed that strain LTYR-11Z T effectively colonizes the rhizoplane of both Arabidopsis and wheat. Strain LTYR-11Z T was able to promote the growth of wheat enhancing its resistance to drought stress. Strain LTYR-11Z T led to increased accumulation of soluble sugars, decreased accumulation of proline and malondialdehyde (MDA), and decreased degradation of chlorophyll in leaves of drought-stressed wheat. Our findings will contribute to the development of a novel biotechnological agent to improve the adaptation of crop plants to drought in arid ecosystems."
"28330082","articletitle","Mutations in the plastidic ACCase gene endowing resistance to ACCase-inhibiting herbicide in Phalaris minor populations from India."
"28330082","abstracttext","Littleseed canarygrass (Phalaris minor Retz.) is one of the most common and troublesome weeds infesting wheat crop in India. Repeated use during the last two decades of the ACCase-inhibiting herbicide (clodinafop) to control this weed has resulted in the occurrence of resistance. Fifty-three P. minor populations were collected from wheat fields in Haryana and Punjab states of India. The dose-response assays indicated that 29 populations were resistant, 23 populations were susceptible and one population was moderately resistant to clodinafop. Sequence analysis of the CT domain of ACCase gene among resistant and susceptible populations revealed two non-synonymous mutations, Trp 2027 to Cys and Ile 2041 to Asn in the resistant populations. Allele-specific PCR markers were developed to differentiate between wild-type and resistant codons at positions 2027 and 2041 of ACCase in P. minor which enables molecular assays for rapid detection and resistance diagnosis for efficient weed management in wheat. This is the first report from India of a target site mutation corresponding to resistance to clodinafop in P. minor."
"28177802","articletitle","Plant growth promotion properties of bacterial strains isolated from the rhizosphere of the Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus L.) adapted to saline-alkaline soils and their effect on wheat growth."
"28177802","abstracttext","The Jerusalem artichoke (JA; Helianthus tuberosus), known to be tolerant to saline-alkaline soil conditions, has been cultivated for many years in the Yellow River delta, Shandong Province coastal zone, in China. The aim of our study was to isolate nitrogen-fixing bacteria colonizing the rhizosphere of JA and to characterize other plant growth promotion properties. The ultimate goal was to identify isolates that could be used as inoculants benefiting an economic crop, in particular for improving wheat growth production in the Yellow River delta. Bacterial strains were isolated from the rhizosphere soil of JA on the basis of growth on nitrogen-free Ashby medium. Identification and phylogenetic analysis was performed after nucleotide sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. Plant-growth-promoting traits, such as nitrogen fixation activity, phosphate solubilization activity, indole-3-acetic acid production, were determined using conventional methods. Eleven strains were isolated and 6 of them were further examined for their level of salt tolerance and their effect on plant growth promotion. Inoculation of Enterobacter sp. strain N10 on JA and wheat led to significant increases in both root and shoot dry mass and shoot height. Enterobacter sp. strain N10 appeared to be the best plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria to increase wheat productivity in future field applications."
"29522338","articletitle","Comparative Transcriptome Analysis Revealing the Effect of Light on Anthocyanin Biosynthesis in Purple Grains of Wheat."
"29522338","abstracttext","To study the mechanism of anthocyanin-biosynthesis regulation, we examined light-regulated gene expression involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple grains of wheat. Ten kinds of anthocyanins were identified from a purple-grained wheat cultivar by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis. Libraries constructed from the total RNA of purple grains under light (L) or dark (D) conditions for 15 or 20 days were sequenced. In total, 1874 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in L20 vs L15, 1432 DEGs were identified in D20 vs D15, 862 DEGs were identified in D15 vs L15, and 1786 DEGs were identified in D20 vs L20. DEG functional enrichments suggested that light-signal transduction is critical to anthocyanin biosynthesis. The 911 DEGs referred to as light-regulated DEGs (LDEGs) involved a number of genes in anthocyanin biosynthesis, transcription regulation, sugar- and calcium-signaling pathways, and hormone metabolism. These findings laid the foundation for future studies on the regulatory mechanisms of anthocyanin biosynthesis in purple grains of wheat."
"28761779","articletitle","Identification of ecogeographical gaps in the Spanish Aegilops collections with potential tolerance to drought and salinity."
"28761779","abstracttext","Drought, one of the most important abiotic stress factors limiting biomass, significantly reduces crop productivity. Salinization also affects the productivity of both irrigated and rain-fed wheat crops. Species of genus Aegilops can be considered crop wild relatives (CWR) of wheat and have been widely used as gene sources in wheat breeding, especially in providing resistance to pests and diseases. Five species ( Ae. biuncialis , Ae. geniculata , Ae. neglecta , Ae. triuncialis and Ae. ventricosa ) are included in the Spanish National Inventory of CWRs. This study aimed to identify ecogeographic gaps in the Spanish Network on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA) with potential tolerance to drought and salinity. Data on the Spanish populations of the target species collected and conserved in genebanks of the Spanish Network on PGRFA and data on other population occurrences in Spain were compiled and assessed for their geo-referencing quality. The records with the best geo-referencing quality values were used to identify the ecogeographical variables that might be important for Aegilops distribution in Spain. These variables were then used to produce ecogeographic land characterization maps for each species, allowing us to identify populations from low and non-represented ecogeographical categories in ex situ collections. Predictive characterization strategy was used to identify 45 Aegilops populations in these ecogeographical gaps with potential tolerance to drought and salinity conditions. Further efforts are being made to collect and evaluate these populations."
"28776783","articletitle","Major structural genomic alterations can be associated with hybrid speciation in Aegilops markgrafii (Triticeae)."
"28776783","abstracttext","During evolutionary history many grasses from the tribe Triticeae have undergone interspecific hybridization, resulting in allopolyploidy; whereas homoploid hybrid speciation was found only in rye. Homoeologous chromosomes within the Triticeae preserved cross-species macrocolinearity, except for a few species with rearranged genomes. Aegilops markgrafii, a diploid wild relative of wheat (2n = 2x = 14), has a highly asymmetrical karyotype that is indicative of chromosome rearrangements. Molecular cytogenetics and next-generation sequencing were used to explore the genome organization. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a set of wheat cDNAs allowed the macrostructure and cross-genome homoeology of the Ae. markgrafii chromosomes to be established. Two chromosomes maintained colinearity, whereas the remaining were highly rearranged as a result of inversions and inter- and intrachromosomal translocations. We used sets of barley and wheat orthologous gene sequences to compare discrete parts of the Ae. markgrafii genome involved in the rearrangements. Analysis of sequence identity profiles and phylogenic relationships grouped chromosome blocks into two distinct clusters. Chromosome painting revealed the distribution of transposable elements and differentiated chromosome blocks into two groups consistent with the sequence analyses. These data suggest that introgressive hybridization accompanied by gross chromosome rearrangements might have had an impact on karyotype evolution and homoploid speciation in Ae. markgrafii."
"29628820","articletitle","Virulence Phenotyping and Molecular Characterization of a New Virulence Type of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis the Causal Agent of Tan Spot."
"29628820","abstracttext","Pyrenophoratritici-repentis is the causal agent of tan spot. According to their ability to produce necrosis and/or chlorosis on a set of four differential bread wheats, the isolates of this fungus are currently grouped into eight races. When durum wheat genotypes were added to the differential set, a new virulence type was identified in Algeria. The isolates showing this virulence pattern are unable to attack bread wheat while they cause necrosis in durum genotypes. In this work, characterization of those isolates was based on pathological and molecular aspects. This included inoculation of bread and durum wheat, and virulence gene analysis using PCR and sequencing. The results showed that all isolates caused a resistance on all bread wheats of the differential set, while they produced necrosis in durum. ToxA and ToxB genes were amplified in all isolates, whereas toxb was absent. Sequence analysis for both genes showed no differences with those found in the two functional genes. The presence of two genes, ToxA and ToxB, despite the absence of symptoms usually caused by their products, suggests the existence of a new homologous for these two genes yet unknown. The presence of ToxA in the isolate unable to produce necrosis in Glenlea is reported for the first time."
"29871482","articletitle","Alterations in the Gut ( Gallus gallus) Microbiota Following the Consumption of Zinc Biofortified Wheat ( Triticum aestivum)-Based Diet."
"29871482","abstracttext","The structure and function of cecal microbiota following the consumption of a zinc (Zn) biofortified wheat diet was evaluated in a well-studied animal model of human nutrition ( Gallus gallus) during a six-week efficacy trial. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, a significant increase in β- but not α-microbial diversity was observed in the animals receiving the Zn biofortified wheat diet, relative to the control. No significant taxonomic differences were found between the two groups. Linear discriminant analysis revealed a group of metagenomic biomarkers that delineated the Zn replete versus Zn deficient phenotypes, such that enrichment of lactic acid bacteria and concomitant increases in Zn-dependent bacterial metabolic pathways were observed in the Zn biofortified group, and expansion of mucin-degraders and specific bacterial groups able to participate in maintaining host Zn homeostasis were observed in the control group. Additionally, the Ruminococcus genus appeared to be a key player in delineating the Zn replete microbiota from the control group, as it strongly predicts host Zn adequacy. Our data demonstrate that the gut microbiome associated with Zn biofortified wheat ingestion is unique and may influence host Zn status. Microbiota analysis in biofortification trials represents a crucial area for study as Zn biofortified diets are increasingly delivered on a population-wide scale."

"28880898","abstracttext","Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element that plays various roles in human health. Understanding the genetic control of Se content and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping provide a basis for Se biofortification of wheat to enhance grain Se content. In the present study, a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from two Chinese winter wheat varieties (Tainong18 and Linmai6) was used to detect QTLs for Se content in hydroponic and field trials. In total, 16 QTLs for six Se content-related traits were detected on eight chromosomes, 1B, 2B, 4B, 5A, 5B, 5D, 6A, and 7D. Of these, seven QTLs were detected at the seedling stage and nine at the adult stage. The contribution of each QTL to Se content ranged from 7.37% to 20.22%. QSsece-7D.2, located between marker loci D-3033829 and D-1668160, had the highest contribution (20.22%). This study helps in understanding the genetic basis for Se contents and will provide a basis for gene mapping of Se content in wheat."
"31073877","articletitle","Identification by comparative transcriptomics of core regulatory genes for higher alcohol production in a top-fermenting yeast at different temperatures in beer fermentation."
"31073877","abstracttext","Undesirable flavor caused by excessive higher alcohols restrains the development of the wheat beer industry. To clarify the regulation mechanism of the metabolism of higher alcohols in wheat beer brewing by the top-fermenting yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae S17, the effect of temperature on the fermentation performance and transcriptional levels of relevant genes was investigated. The strain S17 produced 297.85 mg/L of higher alcohols at 20 °C, and the production did not increase at 25 °C, reaching about 297.43 mg/L. Metabolite analysis and transcriptome sequencing showed that the metabolic pathways of branched-chain amino acids, pyruvate, phenylalanine, and proline were the decisive factors that affected the formation of higher alcohols. Fourteen most promising genes were selected to evaluate the effects of single-gene deletions on the synthesis of higher alcohols. The total production of higher alcohols by the mutants Δtir1 and Δgap1 was reduced by 23.5 and 19.66% compared with the parent strain S17, respectively. The results confirmed that TIR1 and GAP1 are crucial regulatory genes in the metabolism of higher alcohols in the top-fermenting yeast. This study provides valuable knowledge on the metabolic pathways of higher alcohols and new strategies for reducing the amounts of higher alcohols in wheat beer."
"30619866","articletitle","Gluten-Free Products for Celiac Susceptible People."
"30619866","abstracttext","The gluten protein of wheat triggers an immunological reaction in some gluten-sensitive people with HLA-DQ2/8 genotypes, which leads to Celiac disease (CD) with symptomatic damage in the small intestinal villi. Glutenin and gliadin are two major components of gluten that are essentially required for developing a strong protein network for providing desired viscoelasticity of dough. Many non-gluten cereals and starches (rice, corn, sorghum, millets, and potato/pea starch) and various gluten replacers (xanthan and guar gum) have been used for retaining the physical-sensorial properties of gluten-free, cereal-based products. This paper reviews the recent advances in the formulation of cereal-based, gluten-free products by utilizing alternate flours, starches, gums, hydrocolloids, enzymes, novel ingredients, and processing techniques. The pseudo cereals amaranth, quinoa, and buckwheat, are promising in gluten-free diet formulation. Genetically-modified wheat is another promising area of research, where successful attempts have been made to silence the gliadin gene of wheat using RNAi techniques. The requirement of quantity and quality for gluten-free packaged foods is increasing consistently at a faster rate than lactose-free and diabetic-friendly foods. More research needs to be focused on cereal-based, gluten-free beverages to provide additional options for CD sufferers."
"30769598","articletitle","Population Structure, Chemotype Diversity, and Potential Chemotype Shifting of Fusarium graminearum in Wheat Fields of Manitoba."
"30769598","abstracttext","This study was to investigate the variation of acetyl ester derivative of DON at 15-position oxygen (15ADON) and acetyl ester derivative of DON at 3-position oxygen (3ADON) chemotypes and potential chemotype shifting of Fusarium graminearum based on the population structure of this species in Manitoba. The study was conducted in 15 locations with wheat cvs. Superb and AC Barrie in Manitoba from 2004 to 2005. Percentages of chemotypes 3ADON and 15ADON of F. graminearum ranged from 0 to 95.7 and 4.3 to 100%, respectively. The 3ADON chemotype was distributed in the southern part of Manitoba and predominant in Morris and Horndean. The two chemotypes almost shared the same percentage in Portage la Prairie. The 15ADON chemotype was predominant in the other locations. Significant gene flow was found among the populations from Sanford, Portage la Prairie, Hamiota, Plumas, Rapid City, and Virden; the populations from Cartier, Rivers, Killarney, and Souris; and the populations from Morris, Kenville, and Dauphin. There were no differences between the populations from two wheat cultivars and two chemotypes. The great variation of chemotype likely resulted from the great genetic diversity of F. graminearum. Sexual recombination, population age, and cropping system could result in genetic and chemotypic diversities. Wheat seed shipment and long-distance spore transportation of F. graminearum potentially caused the genetic migration and chemotype shifting in Manitoba."
"30861931","articletitle","Inheritance of Leaf Rust Resistance in Wheat Cultivars Grandin and CDC Teal."
"30861931","abstracttext","The hard red spring wheat cultivars Grandin and CDC Teal were genetically examined to determine the number and identity of the leaf rust resistance genes present in both wheats. The two cultivars were crossed with the leaf rust susceptible cultivar Thatcher, and the F 1 plants were backcrossed to Thatcher. Fifty-four and 80 BC 1 F 1 plants derived respectively from Grandin and CDC Teal were selfed to produce BC 1 F 2 families. The BC 1 F 2 families were tested as seedlings with isolates of Puccinia recondita f. sp. tritici that differed for virulence to specific leaf rust resistance genes. The BC 1 F 2 families were also tested in the adult-plant stage in field rust nursery tests. Segregation of BC 1 F 2 families in the seedling tests indicated that Grandin had resistance genes Lr2a, Lr3, and Lr10, and was heterogeneous for Lr16. CDC Teal was shown to have the seedling leaf rust gene Lr1. In field rust nursery tests, both Grandin and CDC Teal were shown to have adult-plant resistance genes Lr13 and Lr34. Additional leaf rust resistance genes that condition effective field resistance should be incorporated into hard red spring wheat cultivars to diversify the leaf rust resistance in this wheat class."

"32153322","abstracttext","Mycorrhizal symbiotic relationship is one of the most common collaborations between plant roots and the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). The first barrier for establishing this symbiosis is plant cell wall which strongly provides protection against biotic and abiotic stresses. The aim of this study was to investigate the gene expression changes in cell wall of wheat root cv . Chamran after inoculation with AMF, Funneliformis mosseae under two different irrigation regimes. To carry out this investigation, total RNA was extracted from the roots of mycorrhizal and non-mycorrhizal plants, and analyzed using RNA-Seq in an Illumina Next-Seq 500 platform. The results showed that symbiotic association between wheat and AMF and irrigation not only affect transcription profile of the plant growth, but also cell wall and membrane components. Of the 114428 genes expressed in wheat roots, the most differentially expressed genes were related to symbiotic plants under water stress. The most differentially expressed genes were observed in carbohydrate metabolic process, lipid metabolic process, cellulose synthase activity, membrane transports, nitrogen compound metabolic process and chitinase activity related genes. Our results indicated alteration in cell wall and membrane composition due to mycorrhization and irrigation regimes might have a noteworthy effect on the plant tolerance to water deficit."
"32192120","articletitle","The Structure and Diversity of Nitrogen Functional Groups from Different Cropping Systems in Yellow River Delta."
"32192120","abstracttext","The Yellow River Delta (YRD) region is an important production base in Shandong Province. It encompasses an array of diversified crop systems, including the corn-wheat rotation system (Wheat-Corn), soybean-corn rotation system (Soybean-Corn), fruits or vegetables system (Fruit), cotton system (Cotton) and rice system (Rice). In this study, the communities of ammonia oxidizer-, denitrifier- and nitrogen (N)-fixing bacteria in those cropping systems were investigated by Illumina Miseq sequencing. We found that Rice soil exhibited significantly higher diversity indices of investigated N-cycling microbial communities than other crop soils, possibly due to its high soil water content. Wheat-Corn soils had higher abundances of nitrification gene amoA and denitrification genes nirK and nirS , and exhibited higher soil potential nitrification rate (PNR), compared with Soybean-Corn, Cotton and Fruit soils. Consistently, redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that soil water content (SWC), electrical conductivity (EC), and total nitrogen (TN) were the most important influencing factors of the diversity and structure of the investigated N-cycling microbial."
"32010164","articletitle","TaRPM1 Positively Regulates Wheat High-Temperature Seedling-Plant Resistance to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ."
"32010164","abstracttext","RPM1 is a CC-NBS-LRR protein that was first shown to be required for resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola in Arabidopsis thaliana . Our previous study showed that TaRPM1 gene in wheat was upregulated about six times following infection by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) under high temperature, compared with normal temperature. To study the function of TaRPM1 in wheat high-temperature seedling-plant (HTSP) resistance to Pst , the full length of TaRPM1 was cloned, with three copies each located on chromosomes 1A, 1B, and 1D. Transient expression of the TaRPM1-GFP fusion protein in Nicotiana benthamiana indicated that TaRPM1 localizes in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Profiling TaRPM1 expression indicated that TaRPM1 transcription was rapidly upregulated upon Pst inoculation under high temperature. In addition, TaRPM1 was induced by exogenous salicylic acid hormone application. Silencing TaRPM1 in wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 (XY 6) resulted in reduced HTSP resistance to Pst in terms of reduced number of necrotic cells and increased uredinial length, whereas no obvious phenotypic changes were observed in TaRPM1 -silenced leaves under normal temperature. Related defense genes TaPR1 and TaPR2 were downregulated in TaRPM1 -silenced plants under high temperature. We conclude that TaRPM1 is involved in HTSP resistance to Pst in XY 6."

"32356426","abstracttext","Our aim was to investigate the bioactivity and mode of action of a novel fungicide 4-chlorocinnamaldehyde thiosemicarbazide (PMDD). As a result of its efficacy against various plant pathogens, its protective fungicidal activity, and systemic transport after root treatment, PMDD could be a promising fungicide to control wheat root diseases. In a field assay, PMDD showed good control efficacy on wheat take-all disease. A biochemical study indicated that PMDD acts as a laccase inhibitor, a to date unique mode of fungicidal action. Moreover, a total of seven stable PMDD-resistant Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici ( Ggt ) mutants were generated and demonstrated no cross-resistance with any commercial fungicides used for take-all disease control, and the gene expression profile further confirmed that laccase could be the target of PMDD. Taken together, we conclude that PMDD is a laccase inhibitor and could be used on wheat to control take-all diseases. The current study could strongly benefit the registration and application of PMDD."

"32499800","abstracttext","Leaf or brown rust of wheat caused by Puccinia triticina ( Pt ) is one of the most damaging diseases globally. Considerable progress has been made to control leaf rust through crop protection chemicals and host plant resistance breeding in southern Africa. However, frequent changes in the pathogen population still present a major challenge to achieve durable resistance. Disease surveillance and monitoring of the pathogen have revealed the occurrence of similar races across the region, justifying the need for concerted efforts by countries in southern Africa to develop and deploy more efficient and sustainable strategies to manage the disease. Understanding the genetic variability and composition of Pt is a pre-requisite for cultivar release with appropriate resistance gene combinations for sustainable disease management. This review highlights the variability and distribution of the Pt population, and the current control strategies, challenges and future prospects of breeding wheat varieties with durable leaf rust resistance in southern Africa. The importance of regular, collaborative and efficient surveillance of the pathogen and germplasm development across southern Africa is discussed, coupled with the potential of using modern breeding technologies to produce wheat cultivars with durable resistance."

"32544264","abstracttext","NPR1 has been found to be a key transcriptional regulator in some plant defence responses. There are nine NPR1 homologues (TaNPR1) in wheat, but little research has been done to understand the function of those NPR1-like genes in the wheat defence response against stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) pathogens. We used bioinformatics and reverse genetics approaches to study the expression and function of each TaNPR1. We found six members of TaNPR1 located on homoeologous group 3 chromosomes (designated as TaG3NPR1) and three on homoeologous group 7 chromosomes (designated as TaG7NPR1). The group 3 NPR1 proteins regulate transcription of SA-responsive PR genes. Downregulation of all the TaNPR1 homologues via virus-induced gene co-silencing resulted in enhanced resistance to stem rust. More specifically downregulating TaG7NPR1 homeologues or Ta7ANPR1 expression resulted in stem rust resistance phenotype. By contrast, knocking down TaG3NPR1 alone did not show visible phenotypic changes in response to the rust pathogen. Knocking out Ta7ANPR1 enhanced resistance to stem rust. The Ta7ANPR1 locus is alternatively spliced under pathogen inoculated conditions. We discovered a new mode of NPR1 action in wheat at the Ta7ANPR1 locus through an NB-ARC-NPR1 fusion protein negatively regulating the defence to stem rust infection."

Most identified transcription factors were active at the early stage of growth and it seemed that NAC and ERF transcription factors had significant roles in regulating genes with different expressions. There was no significant difference in the expression level of NACs between two cultivars. It is proposed that the ERF transcription factor which classified as BREB2C transcription factor could control the expression of LMW-GS genes in two cultivars and functionally act as a repressor for their target genes."

"30545152","abstracttext","Drought is a major adversity that limits crop yields. Further exploration of wheat drought tolerance-related genes is critical for the genetic improvement of drought tolerance in this crop. Here, comparative proteomic analysis of two wheat varieties, XN979 and LA379, with contrasting drought tolerance was conducted to screen for drought tolerance-related proteins/genes. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) technology was used to verify the functions of candidate proteins. A total of 335 differentially abundant proteins (DAPs) were exclusively identified in the drought-tolerant variety XN979. Most DAPs were mainly involved in photosynthesis, carbon fixation, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism, and several other pathways. Two DAPs (W5DYH0 and W5ERN8), dubbed TaDrSR1 and TaDrSR2 , respectively, were selected for further functional analysis using VIGS. The relative electrolyte leakage rate and malonaldehyde content increased significantly, while the relative water content and proline content significantly decreased in the TaDrSR1- and TaDrSR2 -knock-down plants compared to that in non-knocked-down plants under drought stress conditions. TaDrSR1- and TaDrSR2 -knock-down plants exhibited more severe drooping and wilting phenotypes than non-knocked-down plants under drought stress conditions, suggesting that the former were more sensitive to drought stress. These results indicate that TaDrSR1 and TaDrSR2 potentially play vital roles in conferring drought tolerance in common wheat."

"30754473","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina, is an important disease of soft red winter wheat cultivars that are grown in the southern and eastern United States. The objectives of this study were to identify the leaf rust resistance genes in two soft red winter wheat cultivars, Coker 9663 and Pioneer 26R61, that have been widely grown and were initially highly resistant to leaf rust. Both cultivars were crossed with the leaf-rust-susceptible spring wheat cv. Thatcher and the F 1 plants were crossed to Thatcher to obtain backcross (BC 1 ) F 2 families. In seedlings, the Thatcher/Coker 9663 BC 1 F 2 families segregated for three independent seedling resistance genes when tested with different leaf rust isolates. The leaf rust infection types of selected BC 1 F 3 lines, when tested with different leaf rust isolates, indicated that seedling resistance genes Lr9, Lr10, and Lr14a were present. In field plot tests, BC 1 F 4 lines that were seedling susceptible had some adult plant resistance to leaf rust. Seedlings of the Thatcher/Pioneer 26R61 BC 1 F 2 families segregated for two independent resistance genes. Infection types of selected BC 1 F 3 lines indicated the presence of Lr14b and Lr26. The adult plant gene Lr13 was determined to be present in selected BC 1 F 4 lines that were tested with different leaf rust isolates in greenhouse tests."

All isolates were tested for virulence on an international set of eight differential cultivars. Seventeen known wheat leaf rust races and several new, unnamed races were identified. The most common races in each year were races 61, 149, and 192. In 2003, up to 20 isolates each of the seven most common leaf rust races plus 8 to 10 isolates of unnamed races were tested for virulence to 35 near-isogenic wheat lines with different single Lr genes for leaf rust resistance. Isolates were polymorphic for virulence on Lr1, Lr2a, Lr2b, Lr2c, Lr9, Lr19, Lr23, Lr26, and the combination Lr27 + Lr31. No isolates were found virulent on Lr24, Lr25, or Lr28, and few isolates were virulent on Lr9. Few isolates of known races but most isolates of the new, unnamed races were virulent on Lr19. The 35 Lr gene lines also were exposed to mixed-race inoculum in field plots to tests effectiveness of their resistance. Lines with Lr24, Lr25, and Lr28 suffered no leaf rust damage in the field, and lines with Lr9, Lr18, Lr35, Lr36, and the combination Lr27 + Lr31 showed less than 10% severity."

"30843087","abstracttext","The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant growth regulators (PGRs) on the physiology and yield of wheat grown in less fertile sandy soil. The isolated PGPR strains were identified by 16S-rRNA gene sequencing as Planomicrobium chinense (P1), Bacillus cereus (P2) and Pseudomonas fluorescens (P3). Wheat varieties (Galaxy-13 and Pak-2013) differing in sensitivity to drought were soaked in fresh cultures of bacterial isolates and the PGRs (salicylic acid and putrescine) were sprayed at 150 mg/L on seedlings at three leaf stage. PGPR and PGRs treated plants showed significant increase in the contents of chlorophyll, sugar and protein even under harsh environmental conditions. Drought stress enhanced the production of proline, antioxidant enzymes and lipid peroxidation but a decrease was noted in the biochemical content (i.e. chlorophyll, protein and sugar) of inoculated plants. PGPR inoculation also significantly enhanced the yield parameters (i.e. plant height, spike length, grain yield and weight) and improved the fertility status of sandy soil. The accumulation of macronutrient, total NO 3 -N and P concentration and soil moisture content of rhizosphere soil was also enhanced by PGPRs inoculation. It is concluded that the combined effects of PGPR and PGRs have profound effects on the biochemical responses and drought tolerance of wheat grown in sandy soils."

"30897256","abstracttext","To investigate the distribution and diversity of the pathogens associated with Fusarium crown rot in the Huanghuai wheat-growing region (HHWGR) of China, we collected wheat samples with symptomatic stem bases from seven provinces in the HHWGR between 2013 and 2016. A total of 1196 isolates obtained from 222 locations were identified as 9 Fusarium species based on morphological and molecular identification. Of these pathogen species, F. pseudograminearum was the dominant species. Furthermore, F. sinensis was isolated from the disease specimens and tested for virulence to wheat. The result of the pathogenicity revealed that an intraspecific differentiation existed in F. pseudograminearum; sequence analysis of the EF-1α gene showed that 194 F. pseudograminearum isolates were differentiated into two distinct clades which closed to the strains from Australia and China respectively, but neither pathogenicity nor EF-1α sequence was related to the geographic origins of these isolates. However, universal rice primers-polymerase chain reaction showed a correlation with the geographical origins of the 194 isolates, which were divided into eight subclusters, the level of genetic diversity was higher within a geographical population than among the different populations. The results of these analyses can be directly used to facilitate disease monitoring and development of control strategies."

"30919582","abstracttext","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the pathogen-host interactions, and play a Janus-faced role in the resistance and susceptibility of plants to biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. The ascomycete fungus Fusarium graminearum causes hazardous wheat Fusarium head blight worldwide. Deletion of the putative secreted catalase-peroxidase gene in F. graminearum, KatG2, reduced the virulence in wheat spike infection. However, it remains unclear when and where KatG2 scavenges ROS during the invasion of wheat. In this study, we delineate the change in ROS levels in the transition of the infection phase under microscopic observation. Correspondingly, the pathogen switches its strategy of infection with temporal and spatial regulation of KatG2 to counteract oxidative stress generated by host plant cells. With the native promoter-driven KatG2-mRFP strain, we show that KatG2-mRFP expression was induced in planta and accumulated in the infection front region at the early infection stage. In contrast to its ubiquitous cellular localization in runner hyphae, KatG2-mRFP is exclusively located on the cell wall of invading hyphal cells, especially at the pathogen-host cellular interface. Using posttranslational modification analysis, we found that asparagine residues at the 238 and 391 positions of KatG2 could be modified by N-glycosylation and that these two residues are required for KatG2 accumulation and cell wall localization in planta."

"30726944","abstracttext","HaHB4 is a sunflower transcription factor belonging to the homeodomain-leucine zipper I family whose ectopic expression in Arabidopsis triggers drought tolerance. The use of PCR to clone the HaHB4 coding sequence for wheat transformation caused unprogrammed mutations producing subtle differences in its activation ability in yeast. Transgenic wheat plants carrying a mutated version of HaHB4 were tested in 37 field experiments. A selected transgenic line yielded 6% more (P<0.001) and had 9.4% larger water use efficiency (P<0.02) than its control across the evaluated environments. Differences in grain yield between cultivars were explained by the 8% improvement in grain number per square meter (P<0.0001), and were more pronounced in stress (16% benefit) than in non-stress conditions (3% benefit), reaching a maximum of 97% in one of the driest environments. Increased grain number per square meter of transgenic plants was accompanied by positive trends in spikelet numbers per spike, tillers per plant, and fertile florets per plant. The gene transcripts associated with abiotic stress showed that HaHB4's action was not dependent on the response triggered either by RD19 or by DREB1a, traditional candidates related to water deficit responses. HaHB4 enabled wheat to show some of the benefits of a species highly adapted to water scarcity, especially in marginal regions characterized by frequent droughts."

"30297055","abstracttext","This work aimed to study the phenolic acid metabolism of sourdough lactic acid bacteria (LAB) in laboratory media, and in sourdough fermentation with single cultures and in co-fermentations. Lactobacilli were selected from isolates obtained from 35 sourdough samples. Isolates (114 strains) were screened for phenolic acid decarboxylase gene pdc and EPS production. Ferulic acid metabolism of the 18 pdc positive strains was evaluated in mMRS; all pcd positive strains converted ferulic acid by decarboxylation and/or reduction. Single whole wheat and rye malt dough fermentation fermented with lactobacilli or yeasts were characterized with respect to free, conjugated, or bound phenolic acids. Concentrations of free, conjugated, or bound phenolic acids were not altered substantially in chemically acidified sourdoughs, or in yeast fermented doughs. L. plantarum metabolized free ferulic acid in wheat and rye malt sourdoughs; L. hammesii DSM 16381 metabolized syringic and vanillic acids and reduced levels of bound ferulic acid in wheat sourdoughs. Co-fermentation of L. hammesii and L. plantarum achieved release of bound ferulic acid and conversion of the resultant free ferulic acid to dihydroferulic acid and volatile metabolites. Phenolic acid metabolism in sourdoughs was enhanced by co-fermentation with strains exhibiting complementary metabolic activities. Results may enable improvement of bread quality by targeted conversion of phenolic acids during sourdough fermentation."

In this study, we used a large population of 1604 hybrids and their 135 parental components to investigate the genetics and metabolomics underlying the negative relationship of grain yield and quality, and evaluated approaches for their joint improvement. We identified a total of nine trait-associated metabolites and show that prediction using genomic data alone resulted in the highest prediction ability for all traits. We dissected the genetic architecture of grain yield and quality-determining traits and show results of the first mapping of the derived trait grain protein deviation. Further, we provide a genetic analysis of the antagonistic relation of grain yield and protein content and dissect the mode of gene action (pleiotropy vs linkage) of identified QTL. Lastly, we demonstrate that the composition of the training set for genomic prediction is crucial when considering different quality classes in wheat breeding."

"30446715","abstracttext","The production of many food items processed from wheat grain relies on the use of high gluten strength flours. As a result, about 80% of the allelic variability in the genes encoding the glutenin proteins has been lost in the shift from landraces to modern cultivars. Here, the allelic variability in the genes encoding the high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) has been characterized in 152 durum wheat lines developed from a set of landraces. The allelic composition at the two Glu-1 loci (Glu-A1 and -B1) was obtained at both the protein and the DNA level. The former locus was represented by three alleles, of which the null allele Glu-A1c was the most common. The Glu-B1 locus was more variable, with fifteen alleles represented, of which Glu-B1b (HMW-GSs 7 + 8), -B1d (6 + 8) and -B1e (20 + 20) were the most frequently occurring. The composition of HMW-GSs has been used to make inferences regarding the diffusion and diversification of durum wheat. The relationships of these allelic frequencies with their geographical distribution within the Mediterranean basin is discussed in terms of gene-ecology."

The TaARFs, including their conserved domains, exon/intron structures, related microRNAs, and alternative splicing (AS) variants, were then characterized. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that members of the TaARF family share close homology with ARFs in other grass species. qRT-PCR analyses revealed that 20 TaARF members were expressed in different organs and tissues and that the expression of some members significantly differed in the roots, stems, and leaves of wheat seedlings in response to exogenous auxin treatment. Moreover, protein network analyses and co-expression results showed that TaTIR1-TaARF15/18/19-TaIAA13 may interact at both the protein and genetic levels. The results of subsequent evolutionary analyses showed that three transcripts of TaARF15 in the A subgenome of wheat exhibited high evolutionary rate and underwent positive selection. Transgenic analyses indicated that TaARF15-A.1 promoted the growth of roots and leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana and was upregulated in the overexpression plants after auxin treatment. Our results will provide reference information for subsequent research and utilization of the TaARF gene family."

"30688622","abstracttext","The cereal cyst nematode (CCN) has a significant negative impact on production of wheat in China. The presence of pathotypes of both Heterodera avenae and H. filipjevi makes it necessary to identify genetic resources with a wide spectrum of resistance. Results of this study confirmed that the soft white winter wheat 'Madsen' was resistant to many different populations of both H. filipjevi and H. avenae in both naturally infested fields and artificial inoculation tests in China. Fewer juvenile nematodes penetrated roots of Madsen than susceptible 'Wenmai 19' in the early stages of the interaction between the nematodes and plant. Testing wheat cultivars in the pedigree of Madsen demonstrated that the CCN resistance of Madsen was inherited from 'VPM1' via the line 'VPM1/Moisson 951'. Presence of a 2NS chromosome segment from Aegilops ventricosa was detected in Madsen using a Vrga1D-specific marker. However, it appears that gene Pm4b for resistance to powdery mildew (caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici) was not transferred from VPM1 into Madsen because these cultivars had different reaction patterns against 20 B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates from China. Madsen serves as an effective source of host resistance from damage caused by CCN."

"30722196","abstracttext","The cereal cyst nematode Heterodera avenae reduces wheat yields in the Pacific Northwest. Previous evaluations of cultivar resistance had been in controlled environments. Cultivar tolerance had not been evaluated. Seven spring wheat trials were conducted in naturally infested fields in three states over 2 years. A split-plot design was used for all trials. Five trials evaluated both tolerance and resistance in 1.8-by-9-m plots treated or not treated with nematicides. Two trials evaluated resistance in 1-m head rows where each wheat entry was paired with an adjacent row of a susceptible cultivar. Cultivars with the Cre1 resistance gene ('Ouyen' and 'Chara') reduced the postharvest density of H. avenae under field conditions, confirming Cre1 parents as useful for germplasm development. Ouyen was resistant but it was also intolerant, producing significantly lower grain yield in controls than in plots treated with nematicides. Susceptible cultivars varied in tolerance. Undefined resistance was identified in one commercial cultivar ('WB-Rockland) and four breeding lines (UC1711, SO900163, SY-B041418, and SY-97621-05). This research was the first systematic field demonstration of potential benefits to be derived through development and deployment of cultivars with resistance plus tolerance to cereal cyst nematode in North America."

A TSR identified in the advanced breeding line CO960333 and its derivative KS06HW79 was examined in growth-chamber tests conducted under constant temperature regimes of 18, 21, and 24°C against an array of WSMV isolates. At 18°C, all tested isolates systemically infected the pedigree parents, while the progeny line CO960333 remained free of symptoms; at 24°C, all lines were susceptible. At the intermediate temperature of 21°C, the TSR of KS06HW79 was effective in contrast to the TSRs of KS03HW12 and 'RonL'. In field trials conducted in 2011 and 2012, the TSR expressed in KS06HW79 conferred complete protection against yield losses from inoculation with the Sidney 81 isolate of WSMV, while the TSR of RonL conferred similar protection in 2012 but allowed small losses in 2011. The resistance expressed by KS06HW79 is likely not due to the Wsm1 gene because it did not contain the tightly linked J15 sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) DNA marker. These findings suggest that KS06HW79 could be an additional TSR source of value to wheat-breeding programs seeking to control losses from WSMV."

Therefore, this study employed transcriptome analysis to compare the expression patterns of stress response genes under imidacloprid and chlorpyrifos treatment for 15 min, 3 h, and 36 h of exposure. S. avenae adult transcriptome was assembled and characterized first, after which samples treated with insecticides for different lengths of time were compared with control samples, which revealed 602267 differentially expressed unigenes (DEUs). Among these DEUs, 31-790 unigenes were classified into 66-786 categories of gene ontology (GO) functional groups, and 24-760 DEUs could be mapped into 54-268 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Finally, 11 insecticide-tolerance-related unigenes were chosen to confirm the relative expression by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in each treatment. Most of the results between qRT-PCR and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) are well-established.

"31712738","abstracttext","The human gut can be viewed as a flow-through system with a short residence time, a high turnover rate and a spatial gradient of physiological conditions. As a consequence, the gut microbiota is exposed to highly fluctuating environmental determinants presented by the host and diet. Here, we assessed the fermentation and colonisation of insoluble wheat bran by faecal microbiota of three individuals at an unprecedented sampling intensity. Time-resolved 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, revealed a dynamic microbial community, characterised by abrupt shifts in composition, delimiting states with a more constant community, giving rise to a succession of bacterial taxa alternately dominating the community over a 72 h timespan. Early stages were dominated by Enterobacteriaceae and Fusobacterium species, growing on the carbohydrate-low, protein rich medium to which wheat bran was supplemented. The onset of wheat bran fermentation, marked by a spike in short chain fatty acid production with an increasing butyrate proportion and an increased endo-1,4-β-xylanase activity, corresponded to donor-dependent proportional increases of Bacteroides ovatus/stercoris, Prevotella copri and Firmicutes species, which were strongly enriched in the bran-attached community. Literature and database searches provided novel insights into the metabolic and growth characteristics underlying the observed succession and colonisation, illustrating the potency of a time-resolved analysis to increase our understanding of gut microbiota dynamics upon dietary modulations."

However, achievement in breeding for highly resistant cultivars is still not satisfactory. Here, we isolated the major-effect wheat quantitative trait locus, Qfhs.njau-3B, which confers head blight resistance, and showed that it is the same as the previously designated Fhb1. Fhb1 results from a rare deletion involving the 3' exon of the histidine-rich calcium-binding-protein gene on chromosome 3BS. Both wheat and Arabidopsis transformed with the Fhb1 sequence showed enhanced resistance to Fusarium graminearum spread. The translation products of this gene's homologs among plants are well conserved and might be essential for plant growth and development. Fhb1 could be useful not only for curbing Fusarium head blight in grain crops but also for improving other plants vulnerable to Fusarium species."

However, little is known about the genes involved in the interactions between insects and transmitted or nontransmitted viruses, particularly nontransmitted viruses. Sitobion avenae (Fabricius) is a vector of barley yellow dwarf virus GAV strains (BYDV-GAV), but not a vector of wheat dwarf virus (WDV), which is transmitted by the leafhopper [Psammotettix alienus (Dahlbom)]. In this study, S. avenae was utilized to determine the transcriptomic responses after feeding on wheat infected by each of the two viruses, respectively, using an Illumina Hiseq sequencing platform. The transcriptomic data presented 61,508 genes, of which 854 differentially expressed. Moreover, in addition to sharing 208 genes, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in S. avenae exposed to BYDV was higher (800) than that when exposed to WDV (262). The DEGs related to the immune system and fitness of S. avenae in response to BYDV-/WDV-infected plants were identified and analyzed using Gene Ontologies (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and the number of related DEGs was lower as nonvector than as vector.

In this work, we applied flow cytometry to dissect the complex genome of crested wheatgrass into individual chromosomes to facilitate its analysis. Flow karyotypes obtained after the analysis of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI)-stained mitotic chromosomes of diploid and tetraploid accessions consisted of three peaks, each corresponding to a group of two or three chromosomes. To improve the resolution, bivariate flow karyotyping after fluorescent labeling of chromosomes with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated probe (GAA) microsatellite was applied and allowed discrimination and sorting of P genome chromosomes from wheat-crested wheatgrass addition lines. Chromosomes 1P-6P and seven telomeric chromosomes could be sorted at purities ranging from 81.7 to 98.2% in disomics and from 44.8 to 87.3% in telosomics. Chromosome 7P was sorted at purities reaching 50.0 and 39.5% in diploid and tetraploid crested wheatgrass, respectively. In addition to the whole complement chromosomes (A), Bs could be easily discriminated and sorted from a diploid accession at 95.4% purity. The sorted chromosomes will streamline genome analysis of crested wheatgrass, facilitating gene cloning and development of molecular tools to support alien introgression into wheat."

"31509495","abstracttext","Stripe rust, also known as yellow rust, is a significant threat to wheat yield worldwide. Adult plant resistance (APR) is the preferred way to obtain durable protection. Chinese winter wheat cultivar Xinong1376 has maintained acceptable APR to stripe rust in field environments. To characterize APR in this cultivar, 190 F 10 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) developed from Xiaoyan81 × Xinong1376 were evaluated for infection type and disease severity in fields either artificially or naturally inoculated. The population along with parents were genotyped using the Illumina 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Six quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected using the inclusive composite interval mapping method. QYr.nwafu-4AL and QYr.nwafu-6BL.3 conferred stable resistance in all environments, and likely corresponded to a gene-rich region on the long arm of chromosomes 4A and 6B. QYr.nwafu-5AL , QYr.nwafu-5BL, QYr.nwafu-3BL.1 , and QYr.nwafu-3BL.2 were detected only in some environments but enhanced the level of resistance conferred by QYr.nwafu-4AL and QYr.nwafu-6BL.3 . Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers developed for QYr.nwafu-4AL and QYr.nwafu-6BL.3 were confirmed in a subset of RILs and 133 wheat genotypes. The QTL on 4AL and 6BL with their linked KASP markers would be useful for marker-assisted selection to improve stripe rust resistance in breeding programs."

"31681380","abstracttext","Delaying leaf senescence in plants, especially under water stress conditions, can help to maintain the remobilization of stored nutrients in source-sink relationships, thus leading to improved crop yields. Leaf senescence can be delayed by plant hormones such as cytokinin. Here, the Isopentenyl transferase (IPT) gene, encoding a cytokinin biosynthesis enzyme, driven by a modified AtMYB32xs promoter was transformed into wheat. Transgenic wheat plants exhibited delayed leaf senescence, retaining chlorophyll for longer under controlled environment conditions. Selected independent transgenic events and their corresponding nulls were grown under field conditions for two consecutive years under well-watered and water stress treatments using automated rainout shelters. Three independent transgenic events had improved canopy green cover, lower canopy temperatures, and higher leaf water potential than their respective non-transgenic nulls, with no abnormality in morphology and phenology. Increased grain yield was observed in transgenic events under both water treatments, with the yield increase more pronounced under water stress (26-42%). These results have shown that delayed leaf senescence using the chimeric transgene AtMYB32xs-p::IPT can be a useful strategy to achieve grain yield gains in wheat and potentially other crops for sustainable food production."

"32977364","abstracttext","Plant diseases are often caused by a consortium of pathogens competing with one another to gain a foothold in the infection niche. Nevertheless, studies are often limited to a single pathogen on its host. In Europe, fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat is caused by multiple Fusarium species, including Fusarium graminearum and F. poae. Here, we combined a time series of (co)inoculations, monitored by multispectral imaging, transcriptional, and mycotoxin analyses, to study the temporal interaction between both species and wheat. Our results showed coinoculation of F. graminearum and F. poae inhibited symptom development but did not alter mycotoxin accumulation compared to a single inoculation with F. graminearum. In contrast, preinoculation of F. poae reduced both FHB symptoms and mycotoxin levels compared to a single F. graminearum infection. Interestingly, F. poae exhibited increased growth in dual infections, demonstrating that this weak pathogen takes advantage of its co-occurrence with F. graminearum. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR revealed that F. poae induces LOX and ICS gene expression in wheat. We hypothesize that the early induction of salicylic and jasmonic acid-related defences by F. poae hampers a subsequent F. graminearum infection. This study is the first to report on the defence mechanisms of the plant involved in a tripartite interaction between two species of a disease complex and their host."

"32763672","abstracttext","Contamination of durum wheat grain by cadmium (Cd) threatens food safety and is of increasing concern because regulations concerning Cd are becoming stricter due to its toxicity. This work aimed at using soil variables and cultivar types to build models to predict whether durum wheat grain Cd will conform with current and possibly lower regulatory thresholds. We combined multiple Gaussian and logistic regressions and the random forest algorithm to take advantage of their strength. Models tested using cross-validation produced excellent performances including for the lowest regulatory threshold of 0.1 mg Cd/kg, half of the current one: 79-85% of the non-conformity cases were detected and the reliability of predictions was 69-82%. The models enabled identification of a x1.4 variability in grain Cd content between cultivars that do not have the low Cd accumulation allele of the Cdu1 gene. The models confirmed that for the grain Cd content, the between-cultivar variability had much less influence than the phytoavailability of Cd in soil, the critical contexts of which were characterized by the models. For farmers, these models are valuable tools to predict whether durum wheat production will conform with existing and future Cd regulation in foodstuffs."

"32900449","abstracttext","MYB transcription factors (TFs) are one of the largest TF families, and R2R3-type MYB TFs participate in the multiply abiotic stress responses in wheat. In this study, an R2R3-type MYB gene Myb protein colourless 1 located on chromosome D (named TaMpc1-D4), was cloned from wheat. TaMpc1-D4-GFP protein was localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of TaMpc1-D4 reduced drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis lines, which was supported by the lower germination rate, the shorter root length, a higher level of O 2 - and malonaldehyde (MDA), the decreased proline content, and limited activities of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). Furthermore, P5CS1, RD29A, RD29B, DREB2A, ABF3, CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, ERF1, POD1, SOD (Cu/Zn), and CAT1 genes related to the stress and antioxidant system were remarkably down-regulated in TaMpc1-D4 transgenic Arabidopsis lines under drought stress. Silencing TaMpc1-D4 expression in wheat enhanced the relative water content (RWC), the proline content, and the activities of antioxidant enzymes, and activated stress-related and antioxidant-related genes (DREB1, DREB3, ERF3, ERF4b, ABF, P5CS, POD, SOD (Fe), and CAT). Taken together, these results indicated that TaMpc1-D4 negatively modulated drought tolerance by regulating the capacity of the enzyme system and the expression of stress-related and antioxidant-related genes."

"32923022","abstracttext","Species belonging to Aspergillus section Flavi occur naturally in crops and can cause food spoilage and/or toxin production. The aim of this study was to determine the occurrence and diversity of the species of Aspergillus section Flavi found in wheat and sorghum at harvest time and during silage storage, and to evaluate the toxigenic potential of the isolates to determine the contamination risk of mycotoxins in grains. Strains from Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus were found based on multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. This is the first report on the presence of A. parasiticus in wheat from Uruguay. Of the 80 isolates Aspergillus section Flavi , 30% produced aflatoxins (AFs), mainly type B1, and 25% produced cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). Within the isolates from wheat samples, 35% were AFs producers and 27.5% were CPA producers. Among the Aspergillus section Flavi isolates from sorghum, 25% were AFs producers while 22.5% were CPA producers. This work contributes to the knowledge of the species in crops and helps define appropriate strategies for the prevention and control of contamination with AFs and CPA by Aspergillus section Flavi fungi."

"33128382","abstracttext","Wheat is a foremost food grain of Pakistan and occupies a vital position in agricultural policies of the country. Wheat demand will be increased by 60% by 2050 which is a serious concern to meet this demand. Conventional breeding approaches are not enough to meet the demand of growing human population. It is paramount to integrate underutilized genetic diversity into wheat gene pool through efficient and accurate breeding tools and technology. In this study, we present the genetic analysis of a 312 diverse pre-breeding lines using DArT-seq SNPs seeking to elucidate the genetic components of emergence percentage, heading time, plant height, lodging, thousand kernel weight, and yield (Yd) which resulted in detection of 201 significant (p value < 10 -3 ) and 61 highly significant associations (p value < 1.45 × 10 -4 ). More importantly, chromosomes 1B and 2A carried loci linked to Yd in two different seasons, and an increase of up to 8.20% is possible in Yd by positive allele mining. We identified seven lines with > 4 positive alleles for Yd whose pedigree carried Aegilops squarrosa as one of the parents providing evidence that Aegilops species, apart from imparting resistance against biotic stresses, may also provide alleles for yield enhancement."

"33131088","abstracttext","An emerging experimental framework suggests that plants under biotic stress may actively seek help from soil microbes, but empirical evidence underlying such a 'cry for help' strategy is limited. We used integrated microbial community profiling, pathogen and plant transcriptive gene quantification and culture-based methods to systematically investigate a three-way interaction between the wheat plant, wheat-associated microbiomes and Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fp). A clear enrichment of a dominant bacterium, Stenotrophomonas rhizophila (SR80), was observed in both the rhizosphere and root endosphere of Fp-infected wheat. SR80 reached 3.7 × 10 7 cells g -1 in the rhizosphere and accounted for up to 11.4% of the microbes in the root endosphere. Its abundance had a positive linear correlation with the pathogen load at base stems and expression of multiple defence genes in top leaves. Upon re-introduction in soils, SR80 enhanced plant growth, both the below-ground and above-ground, and induced strong disease resistance by boosting plant defence in the above-ground plant parts, but only when the pathogen was present. Together, the bacterium SR80 seems to have acted as an early warning system for plant defence. This work provides novel evidence for the potential protection of plants against pathogens by an enriched beneficial microbe via modulation of the plant immune system."

"32717821","abstracttext","Bran friability (particle size distribution after milling) and water retention capacity (WRC) impact wheat bran functionality in whole grain milling and baking applications. The goal of this study was to identify genomic regions and underlying genes that may be responsible for these traits. The Hard Winter Wheat Association Mapping Panel, which comprised 299 lines from breeding programs in the Great Plains region of the US, was used in a genome-wide association study. Bran friability ranged from 34.5% to 65.9% (median, 51.1%) and WRC ranged from 159% to 458% (median, 331%). Two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on chromosome 5D were significantly associated with bran friability, accounting for 11-12% of the phenotypic variation. One of these SNPs was located within the Puroindoline-b gene, which is known for influencing endosperm texture. Two SNPs on chromosome 4A were tentatively associated with WRC, accounting for 4.6% and 4.4% of phenotypic variation. The favorable alleles at the SNP sites were present in only 15% (friability) and 34% (WRC) of lines, indicating a need to develop new germplasm for these whole-grain end-use quality traits. Validation of these findings in independent populations will be useful for breeding winter wheat cultivars with improved functionality for whole grain food applications."

"33070174","abstracttext","Gibberellin (GA) insensitive dwarfing genes Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b that are responsible for the 'Green Revolution' have been remarkably successful in wheat improvement globally. However, these alleles result in shorter coleoptiles and reduced vigour and hence poor establishment and growth in some environments. Rht18, on the other hand, is a GA sensitive, dominant gene with potential to overcome some of the early growth limitations associated with Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b. We assessed progeny from both a biparental and backcross population that contained tall, single-dwarf and double-dwarf lines, to determine whether Rht18 differs from Rht-D1b and hence verifying its value in wheat improvement. Progeny with Rht18 had an almost identical height to lines with Rht-D1b, and both were about 26% shorter than the tall lines with the double dwarf 13% shorter again. However, coleoptile length of Rht18 was 42% longer than Rht-D1b. We detected no differences in time to terminal spikelet, anthesis and few differences in stem or spike growth. Both dwarfing genes diverted more dry matter to the spike than tall lines from prior to heading. No differences were detected between Rht18 and Rht-D1b that could prevent the adoption of Rht18 in wheat breeding to overcome some of the limitations associated with the 'Green Revolution' genes."

"7787180","abstracttext","Two wheat histone H2B genes (TH123 and TH153) were isolated. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that some characteristic sequence motifs were conserved in both the 5'- and 3'-flanking regions. A canonical TATA box and several CCAAT sequences were present in the presumed promoter regions. Motifs similar or identical to the hexamer (ACGTCA) and octamer (CGCGGATC) motifs that are positive cis-acting elements of the wheat H3 (TH012) promoter were also observed in both the H2B promoters. A gel mobility shift assay indicated that the hexamer and hexamer-like motifs bound the wheat bZIP proteins HBP-1a and/or HBP-1b in vitro. A novel sequence motif, (A/T)(G/A)AAAT(A/G), was found downstream of a translational stop codon as observed in several plant histone H2B cDNAs. Promoter activity was analyzed with H2B promoter-GUS fusion genes in the transient system using tobacco protoplasts. Studies of the promoter function in transgenic tobacco plants showed that the H2B promoters were preferentially active in meristematic tissues. Taken together, our data indicate that the H2B genes are regulated, in part, by the same mechanism as found in H3 and H4 gene transcription."

"18034365","abstracttext","Wdreb2, previously isolated as a DREB2 homolog, is expressed in wheat seedlings under abiotic stresses, such as cold, drought, and high salinity, and following treatment with exogenous ABA. In the present study, we generated transgenic tobacco plants expressing Wdreb2 to clarify roles of Wdreb2 in stress tolerance and the direct trans-activation of Cor/Lea genes by WDREB2. Wdreb2 expression significantly improved freezing and osmotic stress tolerance in tobacco plants. Several putative stress- and ABA-responsive cis-elements were found in the 5' upstream regions of four wheat Cor/Lea genes, Wdhn13, Wrab17, Wrab18, and Wrab19. The expression level of a gusA reporter gene under control of Cor/Lea promoter sequences was enhanced by cold, drought and ABA treatment in transgenic tobacco plants. Moreover, the gusA expression level was markedly enhanced by Wdreb2 expression under nonstressful conditions. These results clearly indicate that WDREB2 acts as a transcription factor and positively regulates Wdhn13, Wrab17, Wrab18, and Wrab19 in the development of multiple abiotic stress tolerance in wheat."

"17095534","abstracttext","The Fertile Crescent represents the center of origin and earliest known place of domestication for many cereal crops. During the transition from wild grasses to domesticated cereals, many host-specialized pathogen species are thought to have emerged. A sister population of the wheat-adapted pathogen Mycosphaerella graminicola was identified on wild grasses collected in northwest Iran. Isolates of this wild grass pathogen from 5 locations in Iran were compared with 123 M. graminicola isolates from the Middle East, Europe, and North America. DNA sequencing revealed a close phylogenetic relationship between the pathogen populations. To reconstruct the evolutionary history of M. graminicola, we sequenced 6 nuclear loci encompassing 464 polymorphic sites. Coalescence analyses indicated a relatively recent origin of M. graminicola, coinciding with the known domestication of wheat in the Fertile Crescent around 8,000-9,000 BC. The sympatric divergence of populations was accompanied by strong genetic differentiation. At the present time, no genetic exchange occurs between pathogen populations on wheat and wild grasses although we found evidence that gene flow may have occurred since genetic differentiation of the populations."

"17168885","abstracttext","Progress in freezing tolerance (FT) improvement through plant breeding approaches has met with little success in the last 50 years. Engineering plants for greater FT through plant transformation is one possible way to reduce the damage caused by freezing. Here, we report an improvement of the selection procedure and the transfer of the wheat Wcor410a acidic dehydrin gene in strawberry. The encoded protein has previously been shown to be associated with the plasma membrane, and its level of accumulation has been correlated with the degree of FT in different wheat genotypes. The WCOR410 protein was expressed in transgenic strawberry at a level comparable with that in cold-acclimated wheat. Freezing tests showed that cold-acclimated transgenic strawberry leaves had a 5 degrees C improvement of FT over wild-type or transformed leaves not expressing the WCOR410 protein. However, no difference in FT was found between the different plants under non-acclimated conditions, suggesting that the WCOR410 protein needs to be activated by another factor induced during cold acclimation. These data demonstrate that the WCOR410 protein prevents membrane injury and greatly improves FT in leaves of transgenic strawberry. A better understanding of the limiting factors allowing its activation may open up the way for engineering FT in different plant organs, and may find applications for the cryopreservation of human tissues and organs."

"17295126","abstracttext","The cereals are of enormous importance to mankind. Many of the major cereal species - specifically, wheat, barley, oat, rye, and maize - have large genomes. Early cytogenetics, genome analysis and genetic mapping in the cereals benefited greatly from their large chromosomes, and the allopolyploidy of wheat and oats that has allowed for the development of many precise cytogenetic stocks. In the genomics era, however, large genomes are disadvantageous. Sequencing large and complex genomes is expensive, and the assembly of genome sequence is hampered by a significant content of repetitive DNA and, in allopolyploids, by the presence of homoeologous genomes. Dissection of the genome into its component chromosomes and chromosome arms provides an elegant solution to these problems. In this review we illustrate how this can be achieved by flow cytometric sorting. We describe the development of methods for the preparation of intact chromosome suspensions from the major cereals, and their analysis and sorting using flow cytometry. We explain how difficulties in the discrimination of specific chromosomes and their arms can be overcome by exploiting extant cytogenetic stocks of polyploid wheat and oats, in particular chromosome deletion and alien addition lines. Finally, we discuss some of the applications of flow-sorted chromosomes, and present some examples demonstrating that a chromosome-based approach is advantageous for the analysis of the complex genomes of cereals, and that it can offer significant potential for the delivery of genome sequencing and gene cloning in these crops."

"19330365","abstracttext","Among abiotic stressors, drought is a major factor responsible for dramatic yield loss in agriculture. In order to reveal differences in global expression profiles of drought tolerant and sensitive wild emmer wheat genotypes, a previously deployed shock-like dehydration process was utilized to compare transcriptomes at two time points in root and leaf tissues using the Affymetrix GeneChip(R) Wheat Genome Array hybridization. The comparison of transcriptomes reveal several unique genes or expression patterns such as differential usage of IP(3)-dependent signal transduction pathways, ethylene- and abscisic acid (ABA)-dependent signaling, and preferential or faster induction of ABA-dependent transcription factors by the tolerant genotype that distinguish contrasting genotypes indicative of distinctive stress response pathways. The data also show that wild emmer wheat is capable of engaging known drought stress responsive mechanisms. The global comparison of transcriptomes in the absence of and after dehydration underlined the gene networks especially in root tissues that may have been lost in the selection processes generating modern bread wheats."

In the present study, the expression of the wheat COMT gene (TaCM) was determined in basal second internodes of lodging-resistant (H4564) and lodging-susceptible (C6001) cultivars at stem elongation, heading, and milky endosperm corresponding to Zadoks stages Z37, Z60, and Z75, respectively. The TaCM protein levels were analysed by protein gel blot and COMT enzyme activity was determined during the same stem developmental stages. TaCM mRNA levels were higher in H4546 from elongation to the milky stages and in C6001 the TaCM mRNA levels decreased markedly at the heading and milky stages. The TaCM protein levels and COMT activity were also higher in H4564 than that in C6001 at the heading and milky stages. These results corresponded to a higher lignin content measured by the Klason method and stem strength and a lower lodging index in H4564 than in C6001 at the heading and milky stages. Therefore, the TaCM mRNA levels, protein levels, and enzyme activity in developing wheat stems were associated with stem strength and lodging index in these two wheat cultivars. Southern analysis in a different population suggested that a TaCM locus was located in the distal region of chromosome 3BL, which has less investigated by QTL for lodging-resistant phenotype."

"19453446","abstracttext","The genomes of barley and wheat, two of the world's most important crops, are very large and complex due to their high content of repetitive DNA. In order to obtain a whole-genome sequence sample, we performed two runs of 454 (GS20) sequencing on genomic DNA of barley cv. Morex, which yielded approximately 1% of a haploid genome equivalent. Almost 60% of the sequences comprised known transposable element (TE) families, and another 9% represented novel repetitive sequences. We also discovered high amounts of low-complexity DNA and non-genic low-copy DNA. We identified almost 2300 protein coding gene sequences and more than 660 putative conserved non-coding sequences. Comparison of the 454 reads with previously published genomic sequences suggested that TE families are distributed unequally along chromosomes. This was confirmed by in situ hybridizations of selected TEs. A comparison of these data for the barley genome with a large sample of publicly available wheat sequences showed that several TE families that are highly abundant in wheat are absent from the barley genome. This finding implies that the TE composition of their genomes differs dramatically, despite their very similar genome size and their close phylogenetic relationship."

"19568730","abstracttext","The wheat and rye spike normally bears one spikelet per rachis node, and the appearance of supernumerary spikelets is rare. The loci responsible for the 'multirow spike' or MRS trait in wheat, and the 'monstrosum spike' trait in rye were mapped by genotyping F(2) populations with microsatellite markers. Both MRS and the 'monstrosum' trait are under the control of a recessive allele at a single locus. The Mrs1 locus is located on chromosome 2DS, co-segregating with the microsatellite locus Xwmc453. The placement of flanking microsatellite loci into chromosome deletion bin 2DS-5 (FL 0.47-1.0) delimited the physical location of Mrs1 to the distal half of chromosome arm 2DS, within the gene rich region 2S0.8. The Mo1 locus maps about 10 cM from the centromere on chromosome arm 2RS. The similar effect on phenotype of mo1 and mrs1, together with their presence in regions of conserved synteny, suggest that they may well be members of an orthologous set of Triticeae genes governing spike branching. The practical importance of the MRS spike is that it produces more spikelets per spike, and thereby enhances the sink capacity of wheat, which is believed to limit the yield potential of the crop."

"25464323","abstracttext","Isoproturon (IPU) is a herbicide widely used to prevent weeds in cereal production. Due to its extensive use in agriculture, residues of IPU are often detected in soils and crops. Overload of IPU to crops is associated with human health risks. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop an approach to mitigate its accumulation in crops. In this study, the IPU residues and its degradation products in wheat were characterized using ultra performance liquid chromatography-time of fight tandem-mass spectrometer/mass spectrometer (UPLC-TOF-MS/MS). Most detected IPU-derivatives were sugar-conjugated. Degradation and glycosylation of IPU-derivatives could be enhanced by applying salicylic acid (SA). While more sugar-conjugated IPU-derivatives were identified in wheat with SA application, lower levels of IPU were detected, indicating that SA is able to accelerate intracellular IPU catabolism. All structures of IPU-derivatives and sugar-conjugated products were characterized. Comparative data were provided with specific activities and gene expression of certain glucosyltransferases. A pathway with IPU degradation and glucosylation was discussed. Our work indicates that SA-accelerated degradation is practically useful for wheat crops growing in IPU-contaminated soils because such crops with SA application can potentially lower or minimize IPU accumulation in levels below the threshold for adverse effects."

"25081411","abstracttext","The Ns genome of the genus Psathyrostachys possesses superior traits useful for wheat improvement. However, very little is known about the high molecular weight (HMW) subunits of glutenin encoded by the Ns genome.

Sequence alignment data shows the four alleles have similar primary structure with those in wheat and other wheat-related grasses, with some unique modifications. All four sequences more closely resemble y-type, rather than x-type, glutenins. However, our results show three of the subunits (1Ns2-4) contain an extra glutamine residue in the N-terminal region not found on typical y-type subunits, as well as the x-type subunit specific sequence LAAQLPAMCRL. These three subunits likely represent an intermediate state in the divergence between x- and y-type subunits. Results also indicate that the Ns genome is more closely related to the St genome of Pseudoroegneria than any other Triticeae genomes."

"31960090","abstracttext_key message","The spring wheat-derived QTL Fhb1 was successfully introgressed into triticale and resulted in significantly improved FHB resistance in the three triticale mapping populations. Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major problem in cereal production particularly because of mycotoxin contaminations. Here we characterized the resistance to FHB in triticale breeding material harboring resistance factors from bread wheat. A highly FHB-resistant experimental line which derives from a triticale × wheat cross was crossed to several modern triticale cultivars. Three populations of recombinant inbred lines were generated and evaluated in field experiments for FHB resistance using spray inoculations during four seasons and were genotyped with genotyping-by-sequencing and SSR markers. FHB severity was assessed in the field by visual scorings and on the harvested grain samples using digital picture analysis for quantifying the whitened kernel surface (WKS). Four QTLs with major effects on FHB resistance were identified, mapping to chromosomes 2B, 3B, 5R, and 7A. Those QTLs were detectable with both Fusarium severity traits. Measuring of WKS allows easy and fast grain symptom quantification and appears as an effective scoring tool for FHB resistance. The QTL on 3B collocated with Fhb1, and the QTL on 5R with the dwarfing gene Ddw1. This is the first report demonstrating the successful introgression of Fhb1 into triticale. It comprises a significant step forward for enhancing FHB resistance in this crop."

"31901703","abstracttext","Free and bound phenolics were extracted from the fibre fraction of wholemeal (W) wheat and barley (B) cookies which had been fortified with 15% blackcurrant powder. Blackcurrant enriched cookies contained between 55 and 66 % higher total phenolics respectively compared control cookies. Ferulic acid in wheat and barley cookie extracts, and quercetin and kaempferol-3-glucoside in wheat cookies with 15% blackcurrant were the dominant phenolic acids. Cellular antioxidant activity was higher in samples with blackcurrant inclusion when evaluated in a cancer cell HepG2 model. Inhibition of cell proliferation was lower for the phenolic samples from cookies with blackcurrant addition. These samples suppressed the regulation of inflammatory cytokine IL-1β (about 3 to 4-fold), IL-6 (about 2-fold) and transcription signalling factor NF-kB (about 2-fold) and showed an up-regulation of the satiety gene NUCB-2/nesfatin-1 (about 4-fold) in compared with control samples."

"31988834","abstracttext","This study was conducted to determine the ability of a bacterial strain FSS2C to ameliorate growth of wheat plants grown under induced stress of reactive black-5 (RB-5). The strain was taxonomically identified as Bacillus firmus on the basis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The B. firmus FSS2C was found physiologically potent in phosphate solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid production and ammonia synthesis in the presence of varying concentrations of azo dye RB-5. Moreover, it decolorized RB-5 in vitro with the maximum decolorization (%) found at pH 7 and 30 °C. Inoculation of wheat plants, growing under stress induced by RB-5 dye, with rifampicin-resistant derivatives of the strain FSS2C substantially reduced the cellular oxidative stress, thereby resulting in higher plant biomass as compared to non-inoculated plants. Similarly, the inoculated plants revealed higher nutrient content in shoots as compared to non-inoculated ones. It was concluded that B. firmus strain FSS2C alleviated the oxidative stress impairment caused by reactive black-5 in wheat plants. Therefore, the strain can be used as bio-inoculant in wastewater irrigated soils."

"32075313","abstracttext","WRKY transcription factors play central roles in developmental processes and stress responses of wheat. Most WRKY proteins of the same group (Group III) have a similar function in abiotic stress responses in plants. TaWRKY46 , a member of Group III, was up-regulated by PEG treatment. TaWRKY46-GFP fusion proteins localize to the nucleus in wheat mesophyll protoplasts. Overexpression of TaWRKY46 enhanced osmotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants, which was mainly demonstrated by transgenic Arabidopsis plants forming higher germination rate and longer root length on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing mannitol. Furthermore, the expression of several stress-related genes ( P5CS1 , RD29B, DREB2A, ABF3, CBF2, and CBF3 ) was significantly increased in TaWRKY46- overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis plants after mannitol treatment. Taken together, these findings proposed that TaWRKY46 possesses vital functions in improving drought tolerance through ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways when plants are exposed to adverse osmotic conditions. TaWRKY46 can be taken as a candidate gene for transgenic breeding against osmotic stress in wheat. It can further complement and improve the information of the WRKY family members of Group III."

"32827964","abstracttext","Arsenic (As) is one of the most toxic contaminants to food crops, and as such, decreasing crops uptake and accumulation of As cannot be overemphasized. Here, we characterized a functional wheat NIP2;1 homolog of the As transporter, TaNIP2;1. TaNIP2;1 expression was suppressed by arsenite (As(III)) in wheat. Ectopic expression of TaNIP2;1 in the Δfps1 yeast mutant enhanced yeast sensitivity towards As(III). Conversely, the elevated expression of TaNIP2;1 in Δacr3 mutants decreased yeast sensitivity to arsenate (As(V)), demonstrating that TaNIP2;1 showed both influx and efflux transport activities for As(III) in yeasts. This is further supported by increased As concentration in the yeast cells that overproduce TaNIP2;1 in Δfps1, while As concentration decreased in Δacr3. Furthermore, ectopic expression of TaNIP2;1 in Arabidopsis confirmed that TaNIP2;1 can transport As into plants, as supported by increased sensitivity to and uptake of As(III). No change in plant sensitivity was found to Cu(II), Cd(II), Zn(II) or Ni(II), indicating that transport activity of TaNIP2;1 is specific for As(III). Taken together, our data show that TaNIP2;1 may be involved in As(III) transportation in plants. This finding reveals a functional gene that can be manipulated to reduce As content in wheat."

"32771624","abstracttext","Soil salinity is one of the typical abiotic stresses affecting sustainability of wheat production worldwide. In the present study, we performed a 35 K SNP genotyping assay on association panel of 135 diverse wheat genotypes evaluated for vegetative stage tolerance in hydroponics. Association analyses using five multi-locus GWAS models revealed 42 reliable QTNs for 10 salt tolerance associated traits. Among these 42 reliable QTNs, 9, 17 and 16 QTNs were associated with physiological, biomass and shoot ionic traits respectively. Novel major QTNs were identified for chlorophyll content, shoot fresh weight, seedling total biomass, Na + and K + concentration and Na + /K + ratio in shoots. Further, 10 major QTNs showed significant effect on the corresponding salt tolerance traits. Gene ontology analysis of the associated genomic regions identified 58 candidate genes. The information generated in this study will be of potential value for improvement of salt tolerance of wheat cultivars using marker assisted selection."
"30699754","articletitle","First Report of Fusarium Head Blight of Wheat Caused by Fusarium sacchari in China."
"30699754","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), or scab, caused by Fusarium species, is an economically devastating disease of wheat and other cereal crops worldwide. FHB epidemics in wheat occur frequently in China, especially along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, including Jiangsu and Shanghai. In 2013, wheat spikes showing clear FHB symptoms were collected from fields in Jiangsu and Shanghai. Symptomatic seeds were surface-sterilized for 1 min with a 5% sodium hypochlorite solution and dipping in 70% ethanol for 30 s, then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water and dried. They were placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated for 3 to 5 days at 28°C in the dark. Fungal colonies displaying morphological characteristics of Fusarium spp. (1,2) were purified by the single-spore technique and characterized at the species level by morphological observations (1,2) and translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF) gene sequencing. The results indicated that members of the Fusarium graminearum clade were predominant on wheat, while the morphological characteristics of 16 isolates were found to be identical to those of F. sacchari (1,2). Colonies on PDA were densely cottony, initially pale but becoming violet with age. The average growth rate was 6 to 8 mm per day at 25°C in the dark. Reverse pigmentation was brownish red to violet-brown. Microconidia, abundant in the aerial mycelium and formed in false heads, were oval to ellipsoidal in shape, primarily zero-septate, measuring 5.7 to 18.8 (average 10.6) μm in length. Macroconidia were slender, three- to five-septate, with a curved apical cell and a poorly developed basal cell, 26.3 to 68.9 (average 44.0) μm in length. No chlamydospores were observed. Two F. sacchari strains (Y37 and S43), isolated from Jiangsu and Shanghai, respectively, were investigated by sequence comparison of their partial TEF gene sequences (Accession Nos. KM233195 and KM233196). BLASTn analysis of the TEF sequences obtained with sequences available in the GenBank database revealed 99.8 and 99.5% sequence identity to F. sacchari (GenBank Accession Nos. JF740708 and JF740709). Pathogenicity tests were conducted by injecting 10 μl of a spore suspension (5 × 10 5 spores/ml) into wheat florets (20 per isolate of cv. Yangmai16), which were then grown under field conditions in Shanghai. Control plants were inoculated with sterile distilled water. Spikes were harvested and evaluated 14 days post-inoculation. Reddish white mold was observed on inoculated wheat spikes; in addition, spikelets adjacent to the inoculation point and the infected florets were brown. No symptoms were observed on water controls. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by reisolating the pathogen from infected florets and identifying them by TEF gene sequencing. F. sacchari is the cause of an important disease of sugar cane, pokkah boeng (1), and has been reported to produce the mycotoxin beauvericin, which causes toxicosis in human and other animals (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. sacchari causing wheat head blight in China. The report contributes to an improved understanding of the composition of Fusarium species on wheat in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River in China, which will be useful for exploring appropriate disease management strategies in this region.

"2102847","articletitle","Classification and characterization of the rice alpha-amylase multigene family."
"2102847","abstracttext","To establish the size and organization of the rice alpha-amylase multigene family, we have isolated 30 alpha-amylase clones from three independent genomic libraries. Partial characterization of these clones indicates that they fall into 5 hybridization groups containing a total of 10 genes. Two clones belonging to the Group 3 hybridization class have more than one gene per cloned fragment. The nucleotide sequence of one clone from Group 1, lambda OSg2, was determined and compared to other known cereal alpha-amylase sequences revealing that lambda OSg2 is the genomic analog of the rice cDNA clone, pOS103. The rice alpha-amylase genes in Group 1 are analogous to the alpha-Amy1 genes in barley and wheat. lambda OSg2 contains sequence motifs common to most actively transcribed genes in plants. Two consensus sequences, TAACAAGA and TATCCAT, were found in the 5' flanking regions of alpha-amylase genes of rice, barley and wheat. The former sequence may be specific to alpha-amylase gene while the latter sequence may be related to a 'CATC' box found in many plant genes. Another sequence called the pyrimidine box (TCCTTTTTC) was found in the alpha-amylase genes as well as other genes regulated by gibberellic acid (GA). Comparisons based on amino acid sequence alignment revealed that the multigene families in rice, barley and wheat shared a common ancestor which contained three introns. Some of the descendants of the progenitor alpha-amylase gene appear to have lost the middle intron while others maintain all three introns."

Three days after an intra-sciatic nerve injection of tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin which labels small-diameter primary afferents, many NR2B and wheat germ agglutinin-double-labeled cells ( approximately 70% of wheat germ agglutinin-labeled neurons) were observed in the L5 dorsal root ganglia. Three days after an intra-sciatic nerve injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin isolectin B4 which labels predominantly non-peptidergic C-fiber primary afferents, NR2B and Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin isolectin B4 double-labeled neurons ( approximately 90% of Bandeiraea simplicifolia agglutinin isolectin B4-labeled neurons) were also observed in the L5 dorsal root ganglion. Three days after an intra-sciatic nerve injection of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit, only approximately 40% of cholera toxin B subunit-labeled neurons were NR2B positive and those labeled neurons tended to be small-sized. When calcitonin gene-related peptide and NR2B were labeled by a double immunofluorescent staining technique, we found that the majority of calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive neurons was NR2B immunoreactive (>90% of calcitonin gene-related peptide-positive neurons, and approximately 60% of NR2B-positive neurons) as well. Size frequency analysis also demonstrated that NR2B subunits were predominantly localized on the small and medium-sized neurons. These results suggest that NR2B subunits are predominantly expressed on small diameter primary afferents, and these NR2B containing N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors may play a role in the modulation of neurotransmitter release from primary afferent terminals."

"12152331","abstracttext","The Pacific Northwest (PNW), an important region for wheat production in the USA, is often subject to water deficits during sowing and grain filling. These deficits reduce the quality and yield of the crop. As a consequence, an important objective of breeding programs in the region is improving the genetic adaptation of wheat cultivars to drought stress. One response to dehydrative stresses is the accumulation of proteins called dehydrins, which are believed to protect membranes and macromolecules against denaturation. We characterized dehydrin accumulation in seedlings during drought stress and its correlation with stress tolerance during grain filling in seven wheat cultivars, 'Connie', 'Gene', 'TAM105', 'Rod', 'Hiller', 'Rhode', and 'Stephens'. A 24-kd dehydrin accumulated in seedlings under stress, but not in irrigated control plants. Connie, TAM105, and Gene started to accumulate dehydrins at the fourth day of stress, while the other cultivars showed dehydrins after twelve days of stress. This differential accumulation in seedlings was associated with stress tolerance at grain filling, characterized by a lower reduction in yield and in the rate of decrease in leaf water potential per day of stress. Connie, TAM105, Gene and Rod where the most tolerant cultivars. The results indicate that expression of this 24-kd dehydrin might serve as a rapid and non-destructive screening technique at the seedling stage. Even though the results are promising, selection experiments using a population segregating for stress tolerance are needed to test more conclusively whether this dehydrin can serve as a genetic marker for cultivars with tolerance to drought stress."

"15703035","abstracttext","Glutenins are multimeric aggregates of high molecular weight (HMW) and low molecular weight (LMW) subunits, which determine the quality in wheat. Development of locus-specific primers is an important step toward cloning specific LMW glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) by PCR method. Based on the publicly available, a pair of primer, namely primer 3 (5' TTGTAGAAACTGCCATCCTT 3') and primer 4 (5' GTCACCGCTGCAT CGACATA 3') was designed and verified to specific for LMW-GS genes located on chromosome 1D in this study. The LMW-GS gene located at the Glu-D3 locus in bread wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 was cloned using this pair of primer. The clone designated as XYGluD3-LMWGS1 (AY263369), contains the endosperm-specific-expression promoter and the entire coding region. Nucleotide sequence comparison of the XYGluD3-LMWGS1 with other reported LMW-GS genes located at different Glu-3 loci showed the degree of identity among them ranged from 59.57% to 99.78%. The LMW-GS genes at the same locus showed more similar to each other than to the gene at different locus. Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the XYGluD3-LMWGS1 with the sequences of 12 group LMW-GSs of wheat cultivar Norin 61 showed that the deduced amino acid sequence was nearly the same to LMW-GS group 10 (identity 99.67%). The deduced LMW-GS contains nine cystine residues, which contained one more cystine residue in the C-terminal conserved domain than previous reported. This was the first LMW-GS gene encoding for a LMW-GS with 9 cystine residues that has been discovered so far."

"18943129","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Leaf and stripe rusts, caused by Puccinia triticina and P. striiformis, respectively, are globally important fungal diseases of wheat that cause significant annual yield losses. A gene that confers slow rusting resistance to leaf rust, designated as Lr46, has recently been located on wheat chromosome 1B. The objectives of our study were to establish the precise genomic location of gene Lr46 using molecular approaches and to determine if there was an association of this locus with adult plant resistance to stripe rust. A population of 146 F(5) and F(6) lines produced from the cross of susceptible 'Avocet S' with resistant 'Pavon 76' was developed and classified for leaf rust and stripe rust severity for three seasons. Using patterns of segregation for the two diseases, we estimated that at least two genes with additive effects conferred resistance to leaf rust and three to four genes conferred resistance to stripe rust. Bulked segregant analysis and linkage mapping using amplified fragment length polymorphisms with the 'Avocet' x 'Pavon 76' population, F(3) progeny lines of a single chromosome recombinant line population from the cross 'Lalbahadur' x 'Lalbahadur (Pavon 1B)', and the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative population established the genomic location of Lr46 at the distal end of the long arm of wheat chromosome 1B. A gene that is closely linked to Lr46 and confers moderate levels of adult plant resistance to stripe rust is identified and designated as Yr29."
"20507479","articletitle","A novel wheat gene encoding a putative chitin-binding lectin is associated with resistance against Hessian fly."
"20507479","abstracttext","SUMMARY The gene-for-gene interaction triggering resistance of wheat against first-instar Hessian fly larvae utilizes specialized defence response genes not previously identified in other interactions with pests or pathogens. We characterized the expression of Hfr-3, a novel gene encoding a lectin-like protein with 68-70% identity to the wheat germ agglutinins. Within each of the four predicted chitin-binding hevein domains, the HFR-3 translated protein sequence contained five conserved saccharide-binding amino acids. Quantification of Hfr-3 mRNA levels confirmed a rapid response and gradual increase, up to 3000-fold above the uninfested control in the incompatible interaction 3 days after egg hatch. Hfr-3 mRNA abundance was influenced by the number of larvae per plant, suggesting that resistance is localized rather than systemic. In addition, Hfr-3 was responsive to another sucking insect, the bird cherry-oat aphid, but not to fall armyworm attack, wounding or exogenous application of methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid or abscisic acid. Western blot analysis demonstrated that HFR-3 protein increased in parallel to mRNA levels in crown tissues during incompatible interactions. HFR-3 protein was detected in both virulent and avirulent larvae, indicating ingestion. Anti-nutritional proteins, such as lectins, may be responsible for the apparent starvation of avirulent first-instar Hessian fly larvae during the initial few days of incompatible interactions with resistant wheat plants."

"19616421","abstracttext","PebC1, a novel protein elicitor was isolated and purified from the mycelium of gray mold fungus, Botrytis cinerea strain BC-4-2-2-1. The protein was eluted through HiTrap DEAE FF and RESOURCE Q anion exchange chromatography and displayed as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 36 kDa on silver staining sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The pI of the purified protein PebC1 was determined by 2-DE and was 4.85. Three peptide segments were obtained by MALDI-TOF. Similarity, the homology matching using protein BLAST search found that two proteins, viz. XP_001593856 and XP_001551609 were having high score and covered sequence of the three peptides. Protein XP_001551609, a deduced protein nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha-polypeptide, was more authentic because it was from Botryotinia fuckeliana that is better known as its anamorph, B.cinerea and showed 95% homology with the three polypeptides. The full cDNA sequence encoding for pebC1 (Genbank accession number FJ748868) was amplified from B. cinerea and consists of 639bp, which is same as a registered gene of XM_001551559, a nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha-polypeptide partial mRNA. The gene encode a hypothetical protein speculated from an annotated genomic sequence from B. fuckeliana B05.10 (NW_001814507) and there is no publication about the gene. The PebC1 protein significantly promoted wheat seedling growth with an optimum protein concentration of 5 microg/mL. Root systemic activity of wheat with 4-5 leaves increased by 1.29 fold, and the wheat seedling drought resistance integrated index increased from 36.53 to 57.08 under two cycles of drought stress after treatment of PebC1. PebC1 protein at the optimum concentration of 10 microg/mL induced 69.19% disease resistance against gray mold fungus in tomato. Furthermore, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxides (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) related to plant resistance metabolism were also increased considerably after PebC1 treatment. PAL activity was increased by 46.84% at 24h post-treatment, while POD and PPO activity increased by 109.5% and 111.0% at 72 h, respectively over the control."

"19578829","abstracttext","The locus Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 confers partial and durable resistance against the devastating fungal pathogens leaf rust, stripe rust, and powdery mildew. In previous studies, this broad-spectrum resistance was shown to be controlled by a single gene which encodes a putative ATP-binding cassette transporter. Alleles of resistant and susceptible cultivars differed by only three sequence polymorphisms and the same resistance haplotype was found in the three independent breeding lineages of Lr34/Yr18/Pm38. Hence, we used these conserved sequence polymorphisms as templates to develop diagnostic molecular markers that will assist selection for durable multi-pathogen resistance in breeding programs. Five allele-specific markers (cssfr1-cssfr5) were developed based on a 3 bp deletion in exon 11 of the Lr34-gene, and one marker (cssfr6) was derived from a single nucleotide polymorphism in exon 12. Validation of reference genotypes, well characterized for the presence or absence of the Lr34/Yr18/Pm38 resistance locus, demonstrated perfect diagnostic values for the newly developed markers. By testing the new markers on a larger set of wheat cultivars, a third Lr34 haplotype, not described so far, was discovered in some European winter wheat and spelt material. Some cultivars with uncertain Lr34 status were re-assessed using the newly derived markers. Unambiguous identification of the Lr34 gene aided by the new markers has revealed that some wheat cultivars incorrectly postulated as having Lr34 may possess as yet uncharacterised loci for adult plant leaf and stripe rust resistance."

"20838758","abstracttext","The OsGW2 gene is involved in rice grain development, influencing grain width and weight. Its ortholog in wheat, TaGW2, was considered as a candidate gene related to grain development. We found that TaGW2 is constitutively expressed, with three orthologs expressing simultaneously. The coding sequence (CDS) of TaGW2 is 1,275 bp encoding a protein with 424 amino acids, and has a functional domain shared with OsGW2. No divergence was detected within the CDS sequences in the same locus in ten varieties. Genome-specific primers were designed based on the sequence divergence of the promoter regions in the three orthologous genes, and TaGW2 was located in homologous group 6 chromosomes through CS nulli-tetrasomic (NT). Two SNPs were detected in the promoter region of TaGW2-6A, forming two haplotypes: Hap-6A-A (-593A and -739G) and Hap-6A-G (-593G and -769A). A cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) marker was developed based on the -593 A-G polymorphism to distinguish the two haplotypes in TaGW2-6A. This gene was fine mapped 0.6 cM from marker cfd80.2 near the centromere in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population. Two hundred sixty-five Chinese wheat varieties were genotyped and association analysis revealed that Hap-6A-A was significantly associated with wider grains and higher one-thousand grain weight (TGW) in two crop seasons. qRT-PCR revealed a negative relationship between TaGW2 expression level and grain width. The Hap-6A-A frequencies in Chinese varieties released at different periods showed that it had been strongly positively selected in breeding. In landraces, Hap-6A-A is mainly distributed in southern Chinese wheat regions. Association analysis also indicated that Hap-6A-A not only increased TGW by more than 3 g, but also had earlier heading and maturity. In contrast to Chinese varieties, Hap-6A-G was the predominant haplotype in European varieties; Hap-6A-A was mainly present in varieties released in the former Yugoslavia, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary and Portugal."

C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) showed that Y93-1-6-6 and Y93-1-A6-4 were different wheat-D. breviaristatum additions. A total of 51 markers (primer/enzyme combinations), including 6 PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) markers and 45 Sequence-Tagged-Site (STS) markers, were selected from 3,774 primer/enzyme combinations to further characterize these two additions. Marker haploytpes suggested that both D. breviaristatum chromosomes in Y93-1-6-6 and Y93-1-A6-4 were rearranged. Stem rust resistance screening indicated that both additions were highly resistant to race RKQQC, whereas only Y93-1-6-6 was resistant to race TTKSK (Ug99). Powdery mildew resistance screening showed that only Y93-1-6-6 was resistant. Pedigree analysis suggested that the stem rust and powdery mildew resistance of Y93-1-6-6 was derived from D. breviaristatum, indicating that the D. breviaristatum chromosomes in Y93-1-6-6 possess a new powdery mildew resistance gene(s), and new stem rust resistance gene(s). These two additions could be used as stem rust or powdery mildew resistance sources in wheat breeding programs."

"23071572","abstracttext","A previous study provided an in-depth understanding of molecular population genetics of European and Asian wheat gene pools using a sequenced 3.1-Mb contig (ctg954) on chromosome 3BS. This region is believed to carry the Fhb1 gene for response to Fusarium head blight. In this study, 266 wheat accessions were evaluated in three environments for Type II FHB response based on the single floret inoculation method. Hierarchical clustering (UPGMA) based on a Manhattan dissimilarity matrix divided the accessions into eight groups according to five FHB-related traits which have a high correlation between them; Group VIII comprised six accessions with FHB response levels similar to variety Sumai 3. Based on the compressed mixed linear model (MLM), association analysis between five FHB-related traits and 42 molecular markers along the 3.1-Mb region revealed 12 significant association signals at a threshold of P<0.05. The highest proportion of phenotypic variation (6.2%) in number of diseased spikelets (NDS) occurred at locus cfb6059, and the physical distance was about 2.9 Kb between umn10 and this marker. Haplotype block (HapB) analysis using a sliding window LD of 5 markers, detected six HapBs in the 3.1-Mb region at r(2)>0.1 and P<0.001 between random closely linked markers. F-tests among Haps with frequencies >0.05 within each HapB at r(2)>0.1 and P<0.001 showed significant differences between the Hap carried by FHB resistant resources, such as Sumai 3 and Wangshuibai, and susceptible genotypes in HapB3 and HapB6. These results suggest that Fhb1 is located within HapB6, with the possibility that another gene is located at or near HapB3. SSR markers and Haps detected in this study will be helpful in further understanding the genetic basis of FHB resistance, and provide useful information for marker-assisted selection of Fhb1 in wheat breeding."
"23555754","articletitle","Swedish spring wheat varieties with the rare high grain protein allele of NAM-B1 differ in leaf senescence and grain mineral content."
"23555754","abstracttext","Some Swedish spring wheat varieties have recently been shown to carry a rare wildtype (wt) allele of the gene NAM-B1, known to affect leaf senescence and nutrient retranslocation to the grain. The wt allele is believed to increase grain protein concentration and has attracted interest from breeders since it could contribute to higher grain quality and more nitrogen-efficient varieties. This study investigated whether Swedish varieties with the wt allele differ from varieties with one of the more common, non-functional alleles in order to examine the effect of the gene in a wide genetic background, and possibly explain why the allele has been retained in Swedish varieties. Forty varieties of spring wheat differing in NAM-B1 allele type were cultivated under controlled conditions. Senescence was monitored and grains were harvested and analyzed for mineral nutrient concentration. Varieties with the wt allele reached anthesis earlier and completed senescence faster than varieties with the non-functional allele. The wt varieties also had more ears, lighter grains and higher yields of P and K. Contrary to previous information on effects of the wt allele, our wt varieties did not have increased grain N concentration or grain N yield. In addition, temporal studies showed that straw length has decreased but grain N yield has remained unaffected over a century of Swedish spring wheat breeding. The faster development of wt varieties supports the hypothesis of NAM-B1 being preserved in Fennoscandia, with its short growing season, because of accelerated development conferred by the NAM-B1 wt allele. Although the possible effects of other gene actions were impossible to distinguish, the genetic resource of Fennoscandian spring wheats with the wt NAM-B1 allele is interesting to investigate further for breeding purposes."

"24221066","abstracttext","The genes controlling resistance to three wheat rusts, viz., leaf rust (Lr26), stem rust (Sr31) and stripe or yellow rust (Yr9), and ω-secalins (Sec1), located on the short arm of rye chromosome 1R, were mapped with respect to each other and the centromere. Analysis of 214 seeds (or families derived from them) from testcrosses between a 1BL.1RS/1R heterozygote and 'Chinese Spring' ditelocentric 1BL showed no recombination between the genes for resistance to the three rusts, suggesting very tight linkage or perhaps a single complex locus conferring resistance to the three rusts. The rust resistance genes were located 5.4 ± 1.7 cM from the Sec1 locus, which in turn was located 26.1 ± 4.3 cM from the centromere; the gene order being centromere - Sec1 - Lr26/Sr31/Yr9 - telomere. In a second test-cross, using a different 1BL.1RS translocation which had only stem rust resistance (SrR), the above gene order was confirmed despite a very large proportion of aneuploids (45.8%) among the progeny. Furthermore, a map distance of 16.0 ± 4.8 cM was estimated for SrR and the telomeric heterochromatin (C-band) on 1RS. These results suggest that a very small segment of 1RS chromatin is required to maintain resistance to all three wheat rusts. It should be possible but difficult to separate the rust resistance genes from the secalin gene(s), which are thought to contribute to dough stickiness of wheat-rye translocation lines carrying 1RS."

"24213553","abstracttext","Wheat vernalization requirement is mainly controlled by the VRN1, VRN2, VRN3, and VRN4 genes. The first three have been cloned and have homoeologs in all three genomes. VRN4 has been found only in the D genome (VRN-D4) and has not been cloned. We constructed a high-density genetic map of the VRN-D4 region and mapped VRN-D4 within a 0.09 cM interval in the centromeric region of chromosome 5D. Using telocentric 5D chromosomes generated from the VRN-D4 donor Triple Dirk F, we determined that VRN-D4 is located on the short arm. The VRN-D4 candidate region is colinear with a 2.24 Mb region on Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 4, which includes 127 predicted genes. Ten of these genes have predicted roles in development but we detected no functional polymorphisms associated to VRN-D4. Two recombination events separated VRN-D4 from TaVIL-D1, the wheat homolog of Arabidopsis vernalization gene VIL1, confirming that this gene is not a candidate for VRN-D4. We detected significant interactions between VRN-D4 and other four genes controlling vernalization requirement (Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, and Vrn-B3), which confirmed that VRN-D4 is part of the vernalization pathway and that it is either upstream or is part of the regulatory feedback loop involving VRN1, VRN2 and VRN3 genes. The precise mapping of VRN-D4 and the characterization of its interactions with other vernalization genes provide valuable information for the utilization of VRN-D4 in wheat improvement and for our current efforts to clone this vernalization gene."

"26163768","abstracttext_key message","A new stem rust resistance gene Sr49 was mapped to chromosome 5BL of wheat. Usefulness of the closely linked markers sun209 and sun479 for marker-assisted selection of Sr49 was demonstrated. Landrace AUS28011 (Mahmoudi), collected from Ghardimaou, Tunisia, produced low stem rust response against Australian pathotypes of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) carrying virulence for several stem rust resistance genes deployed in modern wheat cultivars. Genetic analysis based on a Mahmoudi/Yitpi F3 population indicated the involvement of a single all-stage stem rust resistance gene and it was temporarily named SrM. Bulked segregant analysis using multiplex-ready SSR technology located SrM on the long arm of chromosome 5B. Since there is no other all-stage stem rust resistance gene located in chromosome 5BL, SrM was permanently designated Sr49. The Mahmoudi/Yitpi F3 population was enhanced to generate F6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population for detailed mapping of Sr49 using publicly available genomic resources. Markers sun209 and sun479 flanked Sr49 at 1.5 and 0.9 cM distally and proximally, respectively. Markers sun209 and sun479 amplified PCR products different than the Sr49-linked alleles in 146 and 145 common wheat cultivars, respectively. Six and seven cultivars, respectively, carried the resistance-linked marker alleles sun209 148bp and sun479 200bp ; however, none of the cultivars carried both resistance-linked alleles. These results demonstrated the usefulness of these markers for marker-assisted selection of Sr49 in breeding programs."

"25279141","abstracttext_background","High affinity potassium transporters (HKTs) are located in the plasma membrane of the vessels and have significant influence on salt tolerance in some plants. They exclude Na(+) from the parenchyma cells to reduce Na(+) concentration. Despite many studies, the underlying regulatory mechanisms and the exact functions of HKTs within different genomic backgrounds are relatively unknown. In this study, various bioinformatics techniques, including promoter analysis, identification of HKT-surrounding genes, and construction of gene networks, were applied to investigate the HKT regulatory mechanism."
"25279141","abstracttext_results","Promoter analysis showed that rice HKTs carry ABA response elements. Additionally, jasmonic acid response elements were detected on promoter region of TmHKT1;5. In silico synteny highlighted several unknown and new loci near rice, Arabidopsis thaliana and Physcomitrella patent HKTs, which may play a significant role in salt stress tolerance in concert with HKTs. Gene network prediction unravelled that crosstalk between jasmonate and ethylene reduces AtHKT1;1 expression. Furthermore, antiporter and transferase proteins were found in AtHKT1;1 gene network. Interestingly, regulatory elements on the promoter region of HKT in wild genotype (TmHKT1;5) were more frequent and variable than the ones in cultivated wheat (TaHKT1;5) which provides the possibility of rapid response and better understanding of environmental conditions for wild genotype."

"26092788","abstracttext","This paper reviews current knowledge about genes for resistance to Septoria tritici blotch (STB) of wheat, caused by Zymoseptoria tritici (formerly Mycosphaerella graminicola). These genes can be placed into two classes, although a few may have characteristics of both classes. Qualitative resistance is controlled by genes which control large fractions of genetic variation, 21 of which have been discovered and mapped so far. Most of them have been shown to be genotype-specific, being effective against the minority of Z. tritici isolates which are avirulent, and Stb6 has been shown to control a gene-for-gene relationship. Most qualitative resistances are unlikely to be durable and some formerly effective genes have been overcome by the evolution of pathogen virulence. Quantitative resistance is generally controlled by genes with small-to-moderate effects on STB. They have generally weaker specificity than qualitative genes and have provided more durable resistance. 89 genome regions carrying quantitative trait loci (QTL) or meta-QTL have been identified to date. Some QTL have been mapped at or near loci of qualitative genes, especially Stb6, which is present in several sources of resistance. Another gene of particular interest is Stb16q, which has been effective against all Z. tritici isolates tested so far. In addition to resistance, the susceptibility of wheat cultivars to STB can also be reduced by disease escape traits, some of which may be undesirable in breeding. The fundamental requirements for breeding for STB-resistance are genetic diversity for resistance in wheat germplasm and a field trial site at which STB epidemics occur regularly and effective selection can be conducted for resistance combined with other desirable traits. If these are in place, knowledge of resistance genes can be applied to improving control of STB."

"26070270","abstracttext","Yr36 is an important gene conferring resistance to stripe rust of wheat caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). To determine if the Yr36 resistance is correlated to reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst and cell death, wheat near-isogenic lines with (UC1041 + Yr36) and without (UC1041) the gene were histologically characterized for response to Pst infection. Yr36 conferred stripe rust resistance at both seedling and adult-plant stages when the gene line was tested with Pst race CYR29 at a high-temperature (HT) cycle (12 °C at night and 33 °C during the day). At the HT cycle, the growth of secondary hyphae was obviously suppressed in both seedlings and adult plants of UC1041 + Yr36 compared with those of UC1041. The percentages of infection sites with necrotic host cells in UC1041 + Yr36 were significantly higher than UC1041 60 hours after inoculation (hai) at both seedling and adult-plant stages. Mesophyll cell death in the inoculated UC1041 + Yr36 leaves at the HT cycle was stronger than at a low-temperature (LT) cycle (12 °C at night and 18 °C during the day). At the HT cycle, the level of ROS burst started increasing in the inoculated leaves of UC1041 + Yr36 when Pst hyphae started differentiating and extending, and simultaneously, the number of penetration sites with hypersensitive cell death was also increasing. The results indicate that Yr36 product affects the ROS accumulation and cell death of the host in interaction of wheat with Pst."

"25540818","abstracttext_key message","The wheat association mapping initiative is appropriate for gene discovery without the confounding effects of phenology and plant height. The wheat association mapping initiative (WAMI) population is a set of 287 diverse advanced wheat lines with a narrow range of variation for days to heading (DH) and plant height (PH). This study aimed to characterize the WAMI and showed that this diverse panel has a favorable genetic background in which stress adaptive traits and their alleles contributing to final yield can be identified with reduced confounding major gene effects through genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, we observed lower gene diversity on the D genome, compared with the other genomes. Population structure was primarily related to the distribution of the 1B.1R rye translocation. The narrow range of variation for DH and PH in the WAMI population still entailed segregation for a few markers associated with the former traits, while Rht genes were associated with grain yield (GY). Genotype by environment (G × E) interaction for GY was primarily explained by Rht-B1, Vrn-A1 and markers on chromosomes 2D and 3A when running GWAS with genotype scores from the G × E biplot. The use of PC scores from the G × E biplot seems a promising tool to determine genes and markers associated with complex interactions across environments. The WAMI panel lends itself to GWAS for complex trait dissection by avoiding the confounding effects of DH and PH which were reduced to a minimum (using Rht-B1 and Vrn-A1 scores as covariables), with significant associations with GY on chromosomes 2D, 3A and 3B."

"26779195","abstracttext","TaGS5 genes were cloned from bread wheat and were physically mapped on 3AS and 3DS. Sequencing results revealed that a SNP was found in the sixth exon of TaGS5-A1 gene. The SNP resulted in amino acid change from alanine to serine at the 303 bp position of TaGS5-A1. These two alleles were designated as TaGS5-A1a (alanine at the 303 bp position) and TaGS5-A1b genes (serine at the 303-bp position). Analysis of association of TaGS5-A1 alleles with agronomic traits indicated that cultivars with TaGS5-A1b possessed wider kernel width and higher thousand-kernel weight, as well as significantly lower plant height, spike length, and internode length below spike than those of cultivars with TaGS5-A1a over 3 years. These trait differences between TaGS5-A1a and TaGS5-A1b genotypes were larger in landraces than in modern cultivars. This finding suggested that TaGS5 gene played an important role in modulating yield-related traits in the landraces, which possibly resulted from numerous superior genes gathering in modern cultivars after strong artificial selection. The preferred TaGS5-A1b haplotype underwent very strong positive selection in Chinese modern wheat breeding, but not in Chinese landraces. Expression analysis of the TaGS5-A1 gene indicated that TaGS5-A1b allele possessed significantly higher expression level than TaGS5-A1b allele in differently developmental seeds. This study could provide relatively superior genotype in view of agronomic traits in wheat breeding programs. Likewise, this study could offer important information for the dissection of molecular and genetic basis of yield-related traits."

"27200022","abstracttext","Powdery mildew has a negative impact on wheat production. Novel host resistance increases the diversity of resistance genes and helps to control the disease. In this study, wheat line FG-1 imported from France showed a high level of powdery mildew resistance at both the seedling and adult stages. An F2 population and F2:3 families from the cross FG-1 × Mingxian 169 both fit Mendelian ratios for a single dominant resistance gene when tested against multiple avirulent Blumeria tritici f. sp. tritici (Bgt) races. This gene was temporarily designated PmFG. PmFG was mapped on the multi-allelic Pm2 locus of chromosome 5DS using seven SSR, 10 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-derived and two SCAR markers with the flanking markers Xbwm21/Xcfd81/Xscar112 (distal) and Xbwm25 (proximal) at 0.3 and 0.5 cM being the closest. Marker SCAR203 co-segregated with PmFG. Allelism tests between PmFG and documented Pm2 alleles confirmed that PmFG was allelic with Pm2. Line FG-1 produced a significantly different reaction pattern compared to other lines with genes at or near Pm2 when tested against 49 Bgt isolates. The PmFG-linked marker alleles detected by the SNP-derived markers revealed significant variation between FG-1 and other lines with genes at or near Pm2. It was concluded that PmFG is a new allele at the Pm2 locus. Data from seven closely linked markers tested on 31 wheat cultivars indicated opportunities for marker-assisted pyramiding of this gene with other genes for powdery mildew resistance and additional traits."

"27375643","abstracttext","In previous work, we cloned TaGS5 gene and found the association of TaGS5-A1 alleles with agronomic traits. In this study, the promoter sequence of the TaGS5-A1 gene was isolated from bread wheat. Sequencing results revealed that a G insertion was found in position -1925 bp of the TaGS5-A1 gene (Reference to ATG), which occurred in the Sp1 domain of the promoter sequence. Combined with previous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the TaGS5-A1 exon sequence, four genotypes were formed at the TaGS5-A1 locus and were designated as TaGS5-A1a-a, TaGS5-A1a-b, TaGS5-A1b-a, and TaGS5-A1b-b, respectively. Analysis of the association of TaGS5-A1 alleles with agronomic traits indicated that cultivars with the TaGS5-A1a-b allele possessed significantly higher thousand-kernel weight (TKW) and lower plant height than cultivars with the TaGS5-A1a-a allele, and cultivars with the TaGS5-A1b-b allele showed higher TKW than cultivars with the TaGS5-A1b-a allele. The differences of these traits between the TaGS5-A1a-a and TaGS5-A1a-b alleles were larger than those of the TaGS5-A1b-a and TaGS5-A1b-b alleles, suggesting that the -1925G insertion plays the more important role in TaGS5-A1a genotypes than in TaGS5-A1b genotypes. qRT-PCR indicated that TaGS5-A1b-b possessed the significantly highest expression level among four TaGS5-A1 haplotypes in mature seeds and further showed a significantly higher expression level than TaGS5-A1b-a at five different developmental stages of the seeds, suggesting that high expression of TaGS5-A1 was positively associated with high TKW in bread wheat. This study could provide a relatively superior genotype in view of TKW in wheat breeding programs and could also provide important information for dissection of the regulatory mechanism of the yield-related traits."

"27729435","abstracttext","Chromosomal rearrangements (CRs) play important roles in karyotype diversity and speciation. While many CR breakpoints have been characterized at the sequence level in yeast, insects, and primates, little is known about the structure of evolutionary CR breakpoints in plant genomes, which are much more dynamic in genome size and sequence organization. Here, we report identification of breakpoints of a translocation between chromosome arms 4L and 5L of Triticeae, which is fixed in several species, including diploid wheat and rye, by comparative mapping and analysis of the draft genome and chromosome survey sequences of the Triticeae species. The wheat translocation joined the ends of breakpoints downstream of a WD40 gene on 4AL and a gene of the PMEI family on 5AL. A basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor gene in 5AL junction was significantly restructured. Rye and wheat share the same position for the 4L breakpoint, but the 5L breakpoint positions are not identical, although very close in these two species, indicating the recurrence of 4L/5L translocations in the Triticeae. Although barley does not carry the translocation, collinearity across the breakpoints was violated by putative inversions and/or transpositions. Alignment with model grass genomes indicated that the translocation breakpoints coincided with ancient inversion junctions in the Triticeae ancestor. Our results show that the 4L/5L translocation breakpoints represent two CR hotspots reused during Triticeae evolution, and support breakpoint reuse as a widespread mechanism in all eukaryotes. The mechanisms of the recurrent translocation and its role in Triticeae evolution are also discussed."

"29238355","abstracttext","The effect of short- and long-term cold treatment on the abscisic acid (ABA) and cytokinin (CK) metabolism, and their main biosynthesis- and signaling-related genes were investigated in freezing-sensitive and freezing-tolerant wheat genotypes. Varieties Cheyenne and Chinese Spring substituted with the 5A Cheyenne chromosome, which represented freezing-tolerant genotypes, were compared with the freezing-sensitive Chinese Spring. Hormone levels and gene expression data indicated that the short- and long-term cold treatments are associated with specific regulation of the accumulation of cold-protective proteins and phytohormone levels, as well as the expression profiles of the hormone-related genes. The significant differences were observed between the genotypes, and between their leaf and crown tissues, too. The level of dehydrins, including WCS120 protein, and expression of WCS120 gene were considerably higher in the freezing-tolerant genotypes after 21 days of cold treatment. Expression of Cor14b and CBF14 , cold-responsive regulator genes, was increased by cold treatment in all genotypes, to higher extent in freezing-tolerant genotypes. Cluster analysis revealed that the tolerant genotypes had a similar response to cold treatment, regarding expression of the ABA and CK metabolic genes, as well as hormone levels in leaves. As far as hormone levels in crowns are concerned, however, the strongly freezing-tolerant Cheyenne variety clustered separately from the Chinese Spring and the substitution line, which were more similar to each other after both 1 and 21 days of cold treatment than to Cheyenne. Based on these results we concluded that the 5A chromosome of wheat might have both a direct and an indirect impact on the phytohormone-dependent cold-induced freezing tolerance. Based on the gene expression data, novel genetic markers could be developed, which may be used to determine the freezing tolerance level in a wide range of wheat varieties."

"29265531","abstracttext","Polyploidy occurs in some animals and all flowering plants, including important crops such as wheat. The consequences of polyploidy in crops remain elusive, partly because their progenitors are unknown. Using two resynthesized wheat allotetraploids S l S l AA and AADD with known diploid progenitors, we analyzed mRNA and small RNA transcriptomes in the endosperm, compared transcriptomes between endosperm and root in AADD, and examined chromatin changes in the allotetraploids. In the endosperm, there were more non-additively expressed genes in S l S l AA than in AADD. In AADD, non-additively expressed genes were developmentally regulated, and the majority (62-70%) were repressed. The repressed genes in AADD included a group of histone methyltransferase gene homologs, which correlated with reduced histone H3K9me2 levels and activation of various transposable elements in AADD. In S l S l AA, there was a tendency for expression dominance of S l over A homoeologs, but the histone methyltransferase gene homologs were additively expressed, correlating with insignificant changes in histone H3K9me2 levels. Moreover, more 24-nucleotide small inferring RNAs (siRNAs) in the A subgenome were disrupted in AADD than in S l S l AA, which were associated with expression changes of siRNA-associated genes. Our results indicate that asymmetrical changes in siRNAs, chromatin modifications, transposons and gene expression coincide with unstable AADD genomes and stable S l S l AA genomes, which could help explain the evolutionary trajectories of wheat allotetraploids formed by different progenitors."

"29372381","abstracttext_key message","TaUGT5: can reduce the proliferation and destruction of F. graminearum and enhance the ability of FHB resistance in wheat. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most important toxins produced by Fusarium species that enhances the spread of the pathogen in the host. As a defense, the UDP-glycosyltransferase (UGT) family has been deduced to transform DON into the less toxic form DON-3-O-glucoside (D3G), but the specific gene member in wheat that is responsible for Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance has been little investigated and proved. In this study, a DON and Fusarium graminearum responsive gene TaUGT5, which is specific for resistant cultivars, was cloned with a 1431 bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 476 amino acids in Sumai3. TaUGT5 is located on chromosome 2B, which has been confirmed in nulli-tetrasomic lines of Chinese Spring (CS) and is solely expressed among three homologs on the A, B and D genomes. Over-expression of this gene in Arabidopsis conferred enhanced tolerance when grown on agar plates that contain DON. Similarly, the coleoptiles of wheat over-expressing TaUGT5 showed more resistance to F. graminearum, evidencing reduced proliferation and destruction of plant tissue by the pathogen. However, the disease resistance in spikes was not as significant as that on coleoptile compared with wild-type plants. A subcellular localization analysis revealed that TaUGT5 was localized on the plasma membrane of tobacco leaf epidermal cells. It is possible that TaUGT5 could enhance tolerance to DON, protect the plant cell from the pathogen infection and result in better maintenance of the cell structure, which slows down pathogen proliferation in plant tissue."

"29342185","abstracttext_background","Wheat is the staple food for most of the world's population; however, it is a poor source of zinc. Foliar fertilization of zinc via zinc loaded chitosan nanocarriers (Zn-CNP) post-anthesis has proved to be a promising approach for grain zinc enhancement in durum wheat as evidenced in our earlier study. However, the molecular mechanism of uptake of zinc via Zn-CNP remains unclear."
"29342185","abstracttext_methods/principle findings","Foliar application of Zn-CNP was performed at post anthesis stages in two durum wheat cultivars (MACS 3125 and UC1114, containing the Gpc-B1 gene), and expression levels of several metal-related genes were analyzed during early senescence. Zn-CNP application indeed caused changes in gene expression as revealed by qPCR data on representative genes involved in metal homeostasis, phloem transporters, and leaf senescence. Furthermore, zinc-regulated transporters and iron (Fe)-regulated transporter-like protein (ZIP) family [ZIP1, ZIP7, ZIP15], CA (carbonic anhydrase), and DMAS (2'-deoxymugineic acid synthase) in flag leaves exhibited significant correlation with zinc content in the seeds. The analysis of grain endosperm proteins showed enhancement of gamma gliadins while other gluten subunits decreased. Gene expression within ZIP family members varied with the type of cultivar mostly attributed to the Gpc-B1, concentration of external zinc ions as well as the type of tissue analyzed.

A quarter of these genes were predicted to have 2 to 3 splice variants, resulting in a total of 137 putative translated products. Approximately 45% of TaCsl genes were located on chromosomes 2 and 3. Sequences from the subfamilies C and D were interspersed between the dicots and grasses but those from subfamily A clustered within each group of plants. Proximity of the dicot-specific subfamilies B and G, to the grass-specific subfamilies H and J, respectively, points to their common origin. In silico expression analysis in different tissues revealed that most of the genes were expressed ubiquitously and some were tissue-specific.

"30793159","abstracttext","White grain disorder is a recently emerged wheat disease in Australia, caused by Eutiarosporella darliae, E. pseudodarliae, and E. tritici-australis. The disease cycle of these pathogens and the molecular basis of their interaction with wheat are poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we undertook a comparative genomics analysis focused on the secondary metabolite gene repertoire among these three species. This analysis revealed a diverse array of secondary metabolite gene clusters in these pathogens, including modular polyketide synthase genes. These genes have only been previously associated with bacteria and this is the first report of such genes in fungi. Subsequent phylogenetic analyses provided strong evidence that the modular PKS genes were horizontally acquired from a bacterial or a protist species. We also uncovered a secondary metabolite gene cluster with three polyketide/nonribosomal peptide synthase genes (Hybrid-1, -2, and -3) in E. darliae and E. pseudodarliae. In contrast, only remnant and partial genes homologous to this cluster were identified in E. tritici-australis, suggesting loss of this cluster. Homologues of Hybrid-2 in other fungi have been proposed to facilitate disease in woody plants, suggesting a possible alternative host range for E. darliae and E. pseudodarliae. Subsequent assays confirmed that E. darliae and E. pseudodarliae were both pathogenic on woody plants, but E. tritici-australis was not, implicating woody plants as potential host reservoirs for the fungi. Combined, these data have advanced our understanding of the lifestyle and potential host-range of these recently emerged wheat pathogens and shed new light on fungal secondary metabolism."

"31120795","abstracttext","Secondary metabolites produced by biological control agents may influence the outcome of their interactions with plant pathogenic microorganisms and plants. In the present study, we investigated the role of the nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene nps1 expressed by the biocontrol fungus Clonostachys rosea . A gene expression analysis showed that nps1 was induced during confrontations with the plant pathogenic fungus Botrytis cinerea . Gene deletion strains of nps1 displayed increased growth rates and conidiation. However, the nematicidal activity of culture filtrates from C. rosea Δ nps1 strains was significantly weaker than that from wild-type filtrates ( P ≤ 0.001); after 24 h of incubation with culture filtrates from nps1 deletion strains, only 13 to 33% of a mixed community of nematodes were dead compared with 42% of nematodes incubated with wild-type culture filtrates. The Δ nps1 strains also showed reduced biocontrol efficacy during pot experiments, thus failing to protect wheat seedlings from foot rot disease caused by the plant pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum . Furthermore, C. rosea Δ nps1 strains were not able to reduce populations of plant-parasitic nematodes in soil or in roots of wheat as efficiently as the wild-type strain. Both C. rosea wild-type and Δ nps1 strains increased the dry shoot weight and shoot length of wheat by 20 and 13%, respectively. We showed that NPS1, a putative nonribosomal peptide synthetase encoded by nps1 , is a biocontrol factor, presumably by producing a hitherto unknown nonribosomal peptide compound with antifungal and nematicidal properties that contributes to the biocontrol properties of C. rosea ."

"32477377","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia triticina Eriks. ( Pt ), is a destructive disease found throughout common wheat production areas worldwide. At its adult stage, wheat cultivar Liaochun10 is resistant to leaf rust and the gene for that resistance has been mapped on chromosome 2BS. It was designated LrLC10 and is the same gene as cataloged gene Lr13 by pedigree analysis and allelism test. We fine-mapped it using recessive class analysis (RCA) of the homozygous susceptible F 2 plants derived from crosses using Liaochun10 as the resistant, male parent. Taking advantage of the re-sequencing data of Liaochun10 and its counterpart susceptible parent, we converted nucleotide polymorphisms in the LrLC10 interval between the resistant and susceptible parents into molecular markers to saturate the LrLC10 genetic linkage map. Four indel markers were added in the 1.65 cM map of LrLC10 flanked by markers CAUT163 and Lseq22 . Thirty-two recombinants were identified by those two markers from the 984 F 2 homozygous susceptible plants and were further genotyped with additional ten markers. LrLC10 was finally placed in a 314.3 kb region on the Chinese Spring reference sequence (RefSeq v1.0) that contains three high confidence genes: TraesCS2B01G182800 , TraesCS2B01G182900 , and TraesCS2B01G183000. Sequence analysis showed several variations in TraesCS2B01G182800 and TraesCS2B01G183000 between resistant and susceptible parents. One KASP marker and an indel marker were designed based on the differences in those two genes, respectively, and were validated to be diagnostic co-segregating markers for LrLC10 . Our results both improve marker-assisted selection and help with the map-based cloning of LrLC10 ."

"30518316","abstracttext_background","In flowering plants, lipid biosynthesis and transport within anthers is essential for male reproductive success. TaMs1, a dominant wheat fertility gene located on chromosome 4BS, has been previously fine mapped and identified to encode a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP). Although this gene is critical for pollen exine development, details of its function remains poorly understood."
"30518316","abstracttext_results","In this study, we report that TaMs1 is only expressed from the B sub-genome, with highest transcript abundance detected in anthers containing microspores undergoing pre-meiosis through to meiosis. β-glucuronidase transcriptional fusions further revealed that TaMs1 is expressed throughout all anther cell-types. TaMs1 was identified to be expressed at an earlier stage of anther development relative to genes reported to be necessary for sporopollenin precursor biosynthesis. In anthers missing a functional TaMs1 (ms1c deletion mutant), these same genes were not observed to be mis-regulated, indicating an independent function for TaMs1 in pollen development. Exogenous hormone treatments on GUS reporter lines suggest that TaMs1 expression is increased by both indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and abscisic acid (ABA). Translational fusion constructs showed that TaMs1 is targeted to the plasma membrane."

"31834441","abstracttext_key message","Yield penalty and increased grain protein content traits associated with Aegilops ventricosa 7D introgression have been mapped for the first time, and they are physically distinct from the eyespot resistance locus Pch1. Wheat wild relatives represent an important source of genetic variation, but introgression of agronomically relevant genes, such as for disease resistance, may lead to the simultaneous introduction of genetically linked deleterious traits. Pch1 is a dominant gene, conferring resistance to eyespot and was introgressed to wheat from Aegilops ventricosa as part of a large segment of the 7D V chromosome. This introgression has been associated with a significant yield reduction and a concomitant increase in grain protein content. In this study, we evaluated both traits and their relationship to the location of the Pch1 gene. We found that both QTLs were clearly distinct from the Pch1 gene, being located on a different linkage group to Pch1. In addition, we found that the QTL for increased grain protein content was strong and consistent across field trials, whereas the yield penalty QTL was unstable and environmentally dependent. The yield and grain protein content QTLs were genetically linked and located in the same linkage group. This finding is due in part to the small size of the population, and to the restricted recombination between wheat 7D and Ae. ventricosa 7D v chromosomes. Although recombination in this interval is rare, it does occur. A recombinant line containing Pch1 and 7D_KASP6, the marker associated with increase in grain protein content, but not Xwmc221, the marker associated with the yield penalty effect, was identified."
"31600909","articletitle","One Small RNA of Fusarium graminearum Targets and Silences CEBiP Gene in Common Wheat."
"31600909","abstracttext","The pathogenic fungus Fusarium graminearum ( F. graminearum ), causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) or scab, is one of the most important cereal killers worldwide, exerting great economic and agronomic losses on global grain production. To repress pathogen invasion, plants have evolved a sophisticated innate immunity system for pathogen recognition and defense activation. Simultaneously, pathogens continue to evolve more effective means of invasion to conquer plant resistance systems. In the process of co-evolution of plants and pathogens, several small RNAs (sRNAs) have been proved in regulating plant immune response and plant-microbial interaction. In this study, we report that a F. graminearum sRNA ( Fg-sRNA1 ) can suppress wheat defense response by targeting and silencing a resistance-related gene, which codes a Chitin Elicitor Binding Protein ( TaCEBiP ). Transcriptional level evidence indicates that Fg-sRNA1 can target TaCEBiP mRNA and trigger silencing of TaCEBiP in vivo, and in Nicotiana benthamiana ( N. benthamiana ) plants, Western blotting experiments and YFP Fluorescence observation proofs show that Fg-sRNA1 can suppress the accumulation of protein coding by TaCEBiP gene in vitro. F. graminearum PH-1 strain displays a weakening ability to invasion when Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) vector induces effective silencing Fg-sRNA1 in PH-1 infected wheat plants. Taken together, our results suggest that a small RNA from F. graminearum can target and silence the wheat TaCEBiP gene to enhance invasion of F. graminearum ."

"32747342","abstracttext","Gene regulatory networks are powerful tools which facilitate hypothesis generation and candidate gene discovery. However, the extent to which the network predictions are biologically relevant is often unclear. Recently a GENIE3 network which predicted targets of wheat transcription factors was produced. Here we used an independent RNA-Seq dataset to test the predictions of the wheat GENIE3 network for the senescence-regulating transcription factor NAM-A1 (TraesCS6A02G108300). We re-analyzed the RNA-Seq data against the RefSeqv1.0 genome and identified a set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the wild-type and nam-a1 mutant which recapitulated the known role of NAM-A1 in senescence and nutrient remobilisation. We found that the GENIE3-predicted target genes of NAM-A1 overlap significantly with the DEGs, more than would be expected by chance. Based on high levels of overlap between GENIE3-predicted target genes and the DEGs, we identified candidate senescence regulators. We then explored genome-wide trends in the network related to polyploidy and found that only homeologous transcription factors are likely to share predicted targets in common. However, homeologs which vary in expression levels across tissues are less likely to share predicted targets than those that do not, suggesting that they may be more likely to act in distinct pathways. This work demonstrates that the wheat GENIE3 network can provide biologically-relevant predictions of transcription factor targets, which can be used for candidate gene prediction and for global analyses of transcription factor function. The GENIE3 network has now been integrated into the KnetMiner web application, facilitating its use in future studies."

"32967372","abstracttext","The leaf rust pathogen, Puccinia triticina ( Pt ), threatens global wheat production. The deployment of leaf rust ( Lr ) resistance (R) genes in wheat varieties is often followed by the development of matching virulence in Pt due to presumed changes in avirulence (Avr) genes in Pt . Identifying such Avr genes is a crucial step to understand the mechanisms of wheat-rust interactions. This study is the first to develop and apply an integrated framework of gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertion/deletion (InDel), and copy number variation (CNV) analysis in a rust fungus and identify candidate avirulence genes. Using a long-read based de novo genome assembly of an isolate of Pt ('Pt104') as the reference, whole-genome resequencing data of 12 Pt pathotypes derived from three lineages Pt104, Pt53, and Pt76 were analyzed. Candidate avirulence genes were identified by correlating virulence profiles with small variants (SNP and InDel) and CNV, and RNA-seq data of an additional three Pt isolates to validate expression of genes encoding secreted proteins (SPs). Out of the annotated 29,043 genes, 2392 genes were selected as SP genes with detectable expression levels. Small variant comparisons between the isolates identified 27-40 candidates and CNV analysis identified 14-31 candidates for each Avr gene, which when combined, yielded the final 40, 64, and 69 candidates for AvrLr1 , AvrLr15, and AvrLr24 , respectively. Taken together, our results will facilitate future work on experimental validation and cloning of Avr genes. In addition, the integrated framework of data analysis that we have developed and reported provides a more comprehensive approach for Avr gene mining than is currently available."

"25599859","abstracttext_key message","A new gene for Ug99 resistance from wheat landrace PI 374670 was detected on the long arm of chromosome 7A. Wheat landrace PI 374670 has seedling and field resistance to stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp tritici Eriks. & E. Henn (Pgt) race TTKSK. To elucidate the inheritance of resistance, 216 BC1F2 families, 192 double haploid (DH) lines, and 185 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed by crossing PI 374670 and the susceptible line LMPG-6. The parents and progeny were evaluated for seedling resistance to Pgt races TTKSK, MCCFC, and TPMKC. The DH lines were tested in field stem rust nurseries in Kenya and Ethiopia. The DH lines were genotyped with the 90K wheat iSelect SNP genotyping platform. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that a single dominant gene in PI 374670 conditioned seedling resistance to the three Pgt races. The seedling resistance locus mapped to the long arm of chromosome 7A and this result was verified in the RIL population screened with the flanking SNP markers using KASP assays. In the same region, a major QTL for field resistance was detected in a 7.7 cM interval and explained 34-54 and 29-36% of the variation in Kenya and Ethiopia, respectively. Results from tests with specific Pgt races and the csIH81 marker showed that the resistance was not due to Sr22. Thus, a new stem rust resistance gene or allele, either closely linked or allelic to Sr15, is responsible for the seedling and field resistance of PI 374670 to Ug99."
"31993676","articletitle","Exome sequencing of bulked segregants identified a novel TaMKK3-A allele linked to the wheat ERA8 ABA-hypersensitive germination phenotype."
"31993676","abstracttext_key message","Using bulked segregant analysis of exome sequence, we fine-mapped the ABA-hypersensitive mutant ERA8 in a wheat backcross population to the TaMKK3-A locus of chromosome 4A. Preharvest sprouting (PHS) is the germination of mature grain on the mother plant when it rains before harvest. The ENHANCED RESPONSE TO ABA8 (ERA8) mutant increases seed dormancy and, consequently, PHS tolerance in soft white wheat 'Zak.' ERA8 was mapped to chromosome 4A in a Zak/'ZakERA8' backcross population using bulked segregant analysis of exome sequenced DNA (BSA-exome-seq). ERA8 was fine-mapped relative to mutagen-induced SNPs to a 4.6 Mb region containing 70 genes. In the backcross population, the ERA8 ABA-hypersensitive phenotype was strongly linked to a missense mutation in TaMKK3-A-G1093A (LOD 16.5), a gene associated with natural PHS tolerance in barley and wheat. The map position of ERA8 was confirmed in an 'Otis'/ZakERA8 but not in a 'Louise'/ZakERA8 mapping population. This is likely because Otis carries the same natural PHS susceptible MKK3-A-A660 S allele as Zak, whereas Louise carries the PHS-tolerant MKK3-A-C660 R allele. Thus, the variation for grain dormancy and PHS tolerance in the Louise/ZakERA8 population likely resulted from segregation of other loci rather than segregation for PHS tolerance at the MKK3 locus. This inadvertent complementation test suggests that the MKK3-A-G1093A mutation causes the ERA8 phenotype. Moreover, MKK3 was a known ABA signaling gene in the 70-gene 4.6 Mb ERA8 interval. None of these 70 genes showed the differential regulation in wild-type Zak versus ERA8 expected of a promoter mutation. Thus, the working model is that the ERA8 phenotype results from the MKK3-A-G1093A mutation."

"18433437","abstracttext_summary","A precise regulation of flowering time is central to plant species survival. Therefore, mechanisms have evolved in plants to integrate various environmental cues to optimize flowering time. In this study, we show that the product of the wheat gene TaFT, which integrates photoperiod and vernalization signals promoting flowering, interacts with bZIP proteins TaFDL2 and TaFDL6. We also show that TaFDL2 can interact in vitro with five ACGT elements in the promoter of the meristem identity gene VRN1, suggesting that TaFDL2 is a functional homologue of Arabidopsis FD. No direct interactions between the TaFT protein and the VRN1 promoter were detected. Transgenic wheat plants over-expressing TaFT showed parallel increases in VRN1 transcripts, suggesting that TaFT provides transcriptional activation of VRN1, possibly through interactions with the TaFDL2 protein. The same transgenic plants also showed increased transcript levels of TaFT2 (a TaFT paralogue), indicating that TaFT2 acts downstream of TaFT. The fact that TaFT2 interacts with another bZIP protein TaFDL13, which lacks the ability to interact with the VRN1 promoter, suggests that TaFT and TaFT2 have different gene targets. This observation agrees with the functional divergence observed for the TaFT and TaFT2 orthologous genes in rice. The temperate cereals analyzed so far show VRN1 transcripts in the leaves, a characteristic not observed in Arabidopsis or rice. The high levels of TaFDL2 transcripts observed in wheat leaves provide a simple explanation for this difference. We present a hypothesis to explain the conservation of VRN1 expression in the leaves of temperate cereals."

To test this approach, we have chosen 1RS chromosome arm, which represents only 5.6% of the total rye genome. The 1RS arm is an attractive target as it carries many important genes and because it became part of the wheat gene pool as the 1BL.1RS translocation."

The library comprises two sublibraries constructed using HindIII and EcoRI and provides a deep coverage of about 14-fold of the 1RS arm (442 Mbp).

"12099532","abstracttext","Investigation of low-temperature (LT) tolerance in cereals has commonly led to the region of the vyn-A1 vernalization gene or its homologue in related genomes. Two cultivars, one a non-hardy spring wheat and one a very cold-hardy winter wheat, whose growth habits are determined by the Vrn-A1 (spring habit) and vrn-A1 (winter habit) alleles, were chosen to produce reciprocal near-isogenic lines (NILs). These lines were then used to determine the relationship between rate of phenological development and the degree and duration of LT tolerance gene expression. Each allele was isolated in the genetic backgrounds of the non-hardy spring wheat 'Manitou' and the very cold-hardy winter wheat 'Norstar'. The effects of each allele on phenological development and low-temperature tolerance (LT50) were determined at regular intervals over a 4 degrees C acclimation period of 0-98 d. The vegetative/reproductive transition, as determined by final leaf number (FLN), was found to be a major developmental factor influencing LT tolerance. Possession of a vernalization requirement increased both the length of the vegetative growth phase and LT tolerance. Similarly, increased FLN in spring Norstar and winter Manitou NILs delayed their vegetative/reproductive transition and increased their LT tolerance relative to Manitou. Although the winter Manitou NILs had a lower FLN than the spring Norstar NILs, they were able to extend their vegetative stage to a similar length by increasing the phyllochron (interval between the appearance of successive leaves). Cereal plants have four ways of increasing the length of the vegetative phase, all of which extend the time that low-temperature tolerance genes are more highly expressed: (1) vernalization; (2) photoperiod responses; (3) increased leaf number; and (4) increased length of the phyllochron."

"12773813","abstracttext","In the present study, we identified and characterized two cDNAs, named TaGA1 and TaGA2, encoding alpha subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins synthesized from one-week-old seedling mRNAs of common wheat cv. S615 using RACE PCR and RT-PCR methods. The clone TaGA1 contained an open reading frame that encoded a protein consisting of 383 amino acid residues with a molecular mass of 51.3 kDa, whereas the clone TaGA2 contained an open reading frame encoding 390 amino acids with a molecular mass of 52.5 kDa. At the amino acid level, both cDNAs (TaGA1 and TaGA2) showed 70-96% and 30-40% homologies to plant and animal G-protein alpha (G alpha) subunits, respectively, and 97.7% homology to each other. The regions essential for binding to GTP were conserved among all G alpha subunits in higher plants and mammals examined. However, the C-terminal amino acid sequences of TaGA1 and TaGA2 were similar to those of cereal G alpha subunits (rice and barley) but were different from the analogous sequences of mammalian G alpha subunits as well as from those of the leguminous and Solanaeceous G alpha subunits. Southern analysis revealed that the hexaploid wheat genome contained three major copies of G alpha subunit gene with a few less homologous copies. The analysis of the expression for G alpha subunit genes in wheat showed that both TaGA1 and TaGA2 mRNAs were abundant in one-week-old seedlings, immature seeds harvested one-week after anthesis, young spikes and internodes, indicating constitutive expression patterns in all of the organs tested. Especially, young spikes and internodes exhibited increased levels of mRNA accumulation, suggesting that G alpha subunit gene is highly expressed in actively elongating and fast growing tissues. Moreover, both TaGA1 and TaGA2 showed genome-specific expressions in wheat and may participate in the light-regulated growth and development of the seedlings."

"15340687","abstracttext","The stem rust resistance gene Sr2 has provided durable broad-spectrum, adult-plant resistance to the fungal pathogen Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici throughout wheat-growing regions of the world for more than 50 years. The ability to select for Sr2 in wheat breeding programs was recently improved by the identification of a tightly linked microsatellite marker gwm533. This marker typically amplifies a 120-bp polymerase chain reaction fragment from wheat lines carrying Sr2. In instances where the 120-bp fragment is not associated with the presence of Sr2, DNA sequence analysis has shown that a second allele was amplified, differing in the structure of the microsatellite repeat. To discriminate this allelic homoplasy (alleles identical in size, but not identical by descent), sequence-tagged microsatellites (STM) markers were developed for the Xgwm533 locus. These markers were shown to be diagnostic for the presence of Sr2 in a wide range of germplasm, representative of all major wheat varieties historically grown in Australia. The STMs will be particularly useful for marker-assisted selection in Southern Australian breeding programs, where the use of the marker gwm533 is often precluded by the presence of the non- Sr2-associated 120-bp allele in the pedigree of current breeding germplasm. The STMs also revealed a high incidence of previously undetected allelic homoplasy at the Xgwm533 locus and may have broader utility in genetic research and breeding, as this locus is also reported to be strongly associated with a major gene conferring resistance to Fusarium head blight."

"18944137","abstracttext","ABSTRACT The host-selective toxin Ptr ToxA is produced by races 1 and 2 of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, causal agent of tan spot of wheat. Ptr ToxA has been causally associated with pathogenicity by the race 2 phenotype in this system. However, the role of toxin in disease caused by race 1, the most prevalent form of the fungus in the central and northern Great Plains of North America, has not been rigorously investigated. Three independent wheat lines harboring mutations for insensitivity to Ptr ToxA were derived from ethylmethane sulfonate treatment of the hard red spring wheat cv. Kulm, possessing the single dominant gene for toxin sensitivity. Each of the three mutants was insensitive to Ptr ToxA in bioassays based on necrosis development and electrolyte leakage. Each mutant was crossed to each of the other mutants and to the wild-type Kulm. Segregation data indicate that each mutant line harbors a single recessive mutation for toxin insensitivity that maps to or near the same locus, possibly the toxin-sensitivity gene. Each toxin-insensitive mutant line was susceptible to two isolates of race 1 of P. tritici-repentis. F(2) and F(3) generations derived from crosses between Kulm and each mutant segregated for toxin reaction. However, segregation for fungal reaction was not evident, and all F(3) families were tan spot susceptible regardless of toxin reaction. Host insensitivity to Ptr ToxA is not necessarily equivalent to resistance to race 1. Ptr ToxA should not be used alone as a proxy for fungal inoculations by breeding programs aimed at developing tan spot-resistant wheat."

"18986248","abstracttext","The wheat gene Lr34 confers partial resistance to all races of Puccinia triticina, the causal agent of wheat leaf rust. However, the biological basis for the exceptional durability of Lr34 is unclear. We used the Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array to compare transcriptional changes of near-isogenic lines of Thatcher wheat in a compatible interaction, an incompatible interaction conferred by the resistance gene Lr1, and the race-nonspecific response conditioned by Lr34 3 and 7 days postinoculation (dpi) with P. triticina. No differentially expressed genes were detected in Lr1 plants at either timepoint whereas, in the compatible Thatcher interaction, differentially expressed genes were detected only at 7 dpi. In contrast, differentially expressed genes were identified at both timepoints in P. triticina-inoculated Lr34 plants. At 3 dpi, upregulated genes associated with Lr34-mediated resistance encoded various defense and stress-related proteins, secondary metabolism enzymes, and transcriptional regulation and cellular-signaling proteins. Further, coordinated upregulation of key genes in several metabolic pathways that can contribute to increased carbon flux through the tricarboxylic cycle was detected. This indicates that Lr34-mediated resistance imposes a high energetic demand that leads to the induction of multiple metabolic responses to support cellular energy requirements. These metabolic responses were not sustained through 7 dpi, and may explain why Lr34 fails to inhibit the pathogen fully but does increase the latent period."

Skin prick tests with common and occupational allergens were done, and specific antibodies to wheat flour were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.

Furthermore, haplotype analysis indicated that workers with the haplotype 2, ht2 [GC], had fewer work-related lower respiratory symptoms (P = .021).

"22241993","articletitle","The cysteine rich necrotrophic effector SnTox1 produced by Stagonospora nodorum triggers susceptibility of wheat lines harboring Snn1."
"22241993","abstracttext","The wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum produces multiple necrotrophic effectors (also called host-selective toxins) that promote disease by interacting with corresponding host sensitivity gene products. SnTox1 was the first necrotrophic effector identified in S. nodorum, and was shown to induce necrosis on wheat lines carrying Snn1. Here, we report the molecular cloning and validation of SnTox1 as well as the preliminary characterization of the mechanism underlying the SnTox1-Snn1 interaction which leads to susceptibility. SnTox1 was identified using bioinformatics tools and verified by heterologous expression in Pichia pastoris. SnTox1 encodes a 117 amino acid protein with the first 17 amino acids predicted as a signal peptide, and strikingly, the mature protein contains 16 cysteine residues, a common feature for some avirulence effectors. The transformation of SnTox1 into an avirulent S. nodorum isolate was sufficient to make the strain pathogenic. Additionally, the deletion of SnTox1 in virulent isolates rendered the SnTox1 mutated strains avirulent on the Snn1 differential wheat line. SnTox1 was present in 85% of a global collection of S. nodorum isolates. We identified a total of 11 protein isoforms and found evidence for strong diversifying selection operating on SnTox1. The SnTox1-Snn1 interaction results in an oxidative burst, DNA laddering, and pathogenesis related (PR) gene expression, all hallmarks of a defense response. In the absence of light, the development of SnTox1-induced necrosis and disease symptoms were completely blocked. By comparing the infection processes of a GFP-tagged avirulent isolate and the same isolate transformed with SnTox1, we conclude that SnTox1 may play a critical role during fungal penetration. This research further demonstrates that necrotrophic fungal pathogens utilize small effector proteins to exploit plant resistance pathways for their colonization, which provides important insights into the molecular basis of the wheat-S. nodorum interaction, an emerging model for necrotrophic pathosystems."
"23811695","articletitle","Functions of the lethal leaf-spot 1 gene in wheat cell death and disease tolerance to Puccinia striiformis."
"23811695","abstracttext","Pheophorbide a oxygenase (PaO) is a key enzyme in chlorophyll catabolism that is known to suppress cell death in maize and Arabidopsis. The catalytic activity of PaO in chlorophyll degradation has been clearly demonstrated, but the function of PaO in the regulation of cell death and plant-microbe interactions is largely unknown. In this study, we characterized a PaO homologue in wheat of the lethal leaf-spot 1 gene, TaLls1, that was induced in leaves infected by Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst) and wounding treatment. The TaLls1 protein contains a conserved Rieske [2Fe-2S] motif and a mononuclear iron-binding site typical of PaOs. Silencing of TaLls1 by virus-induced gene silencing in wheat led to leaf cell death without pathogen attacks, possibly due to the accumulation of pheophorbide a (upstream substrate of PaO), indicating a suppressor role of TaLls1, while overexpression of TaLls1 also triggered cell death in both tobacco and wheat leaves, probably owing to the accumulation of the red chlorophyll catabolite (downstream product of PaO). Further deletion mutant analysis showed that the conserved Rieske domain, but not the iron-binding site, was essential for cell death induction. These results thus suggest a threshold for TaLls1 in maintaining cell homeostasis to adapt in various stresses, and shed new light on the role of TaLls1 in cell death regulation. Furthermore, silencing of TaLls1 in wheat did not change the disease symptoms but enhanced tolerance to Pst via an significant increase in H2O2 generation, elevated cell death occurrence, and upregulation of pathogenesis-related genes."

"23989649","abstracttext","The wheat spindle streak mosaic virus (WSSMV) or wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV) resistance gene, Wss1, from Haynaldia villosa, was previously mapped to the chromosome arm 4VS by the development of 4V (4D) substitution and T4DL·4VS translocation lines. For better utilization and more accurate mapping of the Wss1, in this research, the CS ph1b mutant was used to induce new translocations with shortened 4VS chromosome fragments. Thirty-five homozygous translocations with different alien fragment sizes and breakpoints of 4VS were identified by GISH and molecular marker analysis. By field test, it was found that all the identified terminal translocations characterized as having smaller 4VS chromosome segments in the chromosome 4DS were highly resistant to WYMV, while all the interstitial translocations with 4VS inserted into the 4DS were WYMV susceptible. Marker analysis using 32 4VS-specific markers showed that both the terminal and interstitial translocations had different alien fragment sizes. Five specific markers could be detected in the WYMV-resistant terminal translocation line NAU421 with the shortest introduced 4VS fragment, indicating they can be used for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. Based on the resistance evaluation, GISH and molecular marker analysis of the available translocations, the gene(s) conferring the WYMV resistance on 4VS could be further cytologically mapped to the distal region of 4VS, immersed in the bin of FL 0.78-1.00. The newly developed small fragment translocations with WYMV resistance and 4VS specific markers have laid solid groundwork for the utilization in wheat breeding for WYMV resistance as well as further cloning of Wss1."

"23989672","abstracttext_key message","Wheat- Aegilops speltoides recombinants carrying stem rust resistance genes Sr32 and SrAes1t effective against Ug99 and PCR markers for marker-assisted selection. Wild relatives of wheat are important resources for new rust resistance genes but underutilized because the valuable resistances are often linked to negative traits that prevent deployment of these genes in commercial wheats. Here, we report ph1b-induced recombinants with reduced alien chromatin derived from E.R. Sears' wheat-Aegilops speltoides 2D-2S#1 translocation line C82.2, which carries the widely effective stem rust resistance gene Sr32. Infection type assessments of the recombinants showed that the original translocation in fact carries two stem rust resistance genes, Sr32 on the short arm and a previously undescribed gene SrAes1t on the long arm of chromosome 2S#1. Recombinants with substantially shortened alien chromatin were produced for both genes, which confer resistance to stem rust races in the TTKSK (Ug99) lineage and representative races of all Australian stem rust lineages. Selected recombinants were back crossed into adapted Australian cultivars and PCR markers were developed to facilitate the incorporation of these genes into future wheat varieties. Our recombinants and those from several other labs now show that Sr32, Sr39, and SrAes7t on the short arm and Sr47 and SrAes1t on the long arm of 2S#1 form two linkage groups and at present no rust races are described that can distinguish these resistance specificities."
"24454317","articletitle","Using transcription of six Puccinia triticina races to identify the effective secretome during infection of wheat."
"24454317","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust, caused by the basidiomycete Puccinia triticina, can cause yield losses of up to 20% in wheat producing regions. During infection, the fungus forms haustoria that secrete proteins into the plant cell and effect changes in plant transcription, metabolism, and defense. It is hypothesized that new races emerge as a result of overcoming plant resistance via changes in the secreted effector proteins. To understand gene expression during infection and find genetic differences associated with races, RNA from wheat leaves infected with six different rust races, at 6 days post inoculation, was sequenced using Illumina. As P. triticina is an obligate biotroph, RNA from both the host and fungi were present and separated by alignment to the P. triticina genome and a wheat EST reference. A total of 222,571 rust contigs were assembled from 165 million reads. An examination of the resulting contigs revealed 532 predicted secreted proteins among the transcripts. Of these, 456 were found in all races. Fifteen genes were found with amino acid changes, corresponding to putative avirulence effectors potentially recognized by 11 different leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes. Twelve of the potential avirulence effectors have no homology to known genes. One gene had significant similarity to cerato-platanin, a known fungal elicitor, and another showed similarity to fungal tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin synthesis. Temporal expression profiles were developed for these genes by qRT-PCR and show that the genes expression patterns were consistent between races from infection initiation to just prior to spore eruption."
"24247343","articletitle","The structure and genetic control of a new class of disulphide-linked proteins in wheat endosperm."
"24247343","abstracttext","Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of unreduced total protein extracts from the endosperm of hexaploid wheat revealed three high molecular weight protein bands (triplet bands) in a zone of heavy background streaking. Electrophoretic examination of 135 hexaploid cultivars showed at least five different patterns of these triplet bands. Nine durum wheat cultivars showed a single band only. Analysis of nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelocentric lines of 'Chinese Spring' wheat revealed that the slowest moving band (Tri-1) of the triplet was controlled by gene(s) on chromosome arm 1DS and the fastest moving band (Tri-3) by 1AS. The band with intermediate mobility (Tri-2) was found to be a hybrid aggregate of the subunits controlled by 1DS and 1AS. Using a non-reducing/reducing form of 2-dimensional (2-D) electrophoresis, these triplet bands were shown to be heterotetramers of four subunits designated D (M.W. 58,000), δ (22,000), A (52,000) and α (23,000) where Tri-1=DδDδ, Tri-2 = DδAα and Tri-3 = AαAα. With very low concentrations of 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), the tetramers dissociated into dimeric subunit pairs (Dδ, Aα), the monomers being observed with higher concentrations of ME. The structure of these subunit pairs resembles that of the subunit pairs in the globulin storage proteins of oats and some legumes. The 2-D method employed in this study was useful also for separating low molecular weight (LMW) subunits of glutenin from the monomeric gliadins which have similar electrophoretic mobility in 1-D separation. It was shown that at least four of these LMW glutenin subunits are controlled by genes on 1DS and 1AS and at least one subunit is controlled by gene(s) on 1BS. This electrophoretic separation method has proven useful in understanding the aggregation behaviour of the seed proteins of wheat."

"25098419","abstracttext","WRKY, a plant-specific transcription factor family, has important roles in pathogen defense, abiotic cues and phytohormone signaling, yet little is known about their roles and molecular mechanism of function in response to rust diseases in wheat. We identified 100 TaWRKY sequences using wheat Expressed Sequence Tag database of which 22 WRKY sequences were novel. Identified proteins were characterized based on their zinc finger motifs and phylogenetic analysis clustered them into six clades consisting of class IIc and class III WRKY proteins. Functional annotation revealed major functions in metabolic and cellular processes in control plants; whereas response to stimuli, signaling and defense in pathogen inoculated plants, their major molecular function being binding to DNA. Tag-based expression analysis of the identified genes revealed differential expression between mock and Puccinia triticina inoculated wheat near isogenic lines. Gene expression was also performed with six rust-related microarray experiments at Gene Expression Omnibus database. TaWRKY10, 15, 17 and 56 were common in both tag-based and microarray-based differential expression analysis and could be representing rust specific WRKY genes. The obtained results will bestow insight into the functional characterization of WRKY transcription factors responsive to leaf rust pathogenesis that can be used as candidate genes in molecular breeding programs to improve biotic stress tolerance in wheat."

Although the molecular toolbox for T. reesei is already well developed, repressible promoters for strain engineering and functional genomics studies are still lacking. One such promoter that is widely employed for yeasts is that of the L-methionine repressible MET3 gene, encoding ATP sulphurylase."
"26271614","abstracttext_results","We show that the MET3 system can only be applied for T. reesei when the cellulase inducing carbon source lactose is used but not when wheat straw, a relevant lignocellulosic substrate for enzyme production, is employed. We therefore performed a transcriptomic screen for genes that are L-methionine repressible in a wheat straw culture. This analysis retrieved 50 differentially regulated genes of which 33 were downregulated. Among these, genes encoding transport proteins as well as iron containing DszA like monooxygenases and TauD like dioxygenases were strongly overrepresented. We show that the promoter region of one of these dioxygenases can be used for the strongly repressible expression of the Aspergillus niger sucA encoded extracellular invertase in T. reesei wheat straw cultures. This system is also portable to other carbon sources including D-glucose and glycerol as demonstrated by the repressible expression of the Escherichia coli lacZ encoded ß-galactosidase in T. reesei."

"26187026","abstracttext","Septoria nodorum blotch (SNB), caused by Parastagonospora nodorum, is a severe foliar and glume disease on durum and common wheat. Pathogen-produced necrotrophic effectors (NEs) are the major determinants for SNB on leaves. One such NE is SnTox3, which evokes programmed cell death and leads to disease when recognized by the wheat Snn3-B1 gene. Here, we developed saturated genetic linkage maps of the Snn3-B1 region using two F2 populations derived from the SnTox3-sensitive line Sumai 3 crossed with different SnTox3-insensitive lines. Markers were identified and/or developed from various resources including previously mapped simple sequence repeats, bin-mapped expressed sequence tags, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and whole genome survey sequences. Subsequent high-resolution mapping of the Snn3-B1 locus in 5600 gametes delineated the gene to a 1.5 cM interval. Analysis of micro-colinearity of the Snn3-B1 region indicated that it was highly disrupted compared to rice and Brachypodium distachyon. The screening of a collection of durum and common wheat cultivars with tightly linked markers indicated they are not diagnostic for the presence of Snn3-B1, but can be useful for marker-assisted selection if the SnTox3 reactions of lines are first determined. Finally, we developed an ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutant population of Sumai 3 where the screening of 408 M2 families led to the identification of 17 SnTox3-insensitive mutants. These mutants along with the markers and high-resolution map developed in this research provide a strong foundation for the map-based cloning of Snn3-B1, which will broaden our understanding of the wheat-P. nodorum system and plant-necrotrophic pathogen interactions in general."

Identification results indicated that there is a novel Tamyb10-B1 allele, designated Tamyb10-B1c, in the five Chinese landraces. The Tamyb10-B1c possibly has a large deletion including Tamyb10-B1 gene. There are three novel Tamyb10-D1 alleles (Aetmyb10-D1c, Aetmyb10-D1d and Aetmyb10-D1e) that were discovered in Aegilops tauschii. Of them, Aetmyb10-D1c allele possessed a 104-bp deletion and this resulted in a frame shift in the open reading frame of the Aetmyb10-D1 gene. AETMYB10-D1d and AETMYB10-D1e proteins possessed three and two different amino acids when compared with TAMYB10-D1b protein, respectively. Association of Tamyb10-1 allelic variation with grain germination level indicated that all five allelic combinations with red grains showed a significantly higher GP (germination percentage) and GI (germination index) values than those of white-grained Tamyb10-A1a/Tamyb10-B1a/Tamyb10-D1a genotype after storing it for one year. Moreover, the Tamyb10-A1b/Tamyb10-B1c/Tamyb10-D1b genotype possesses the significantly highest GP and GI among the six different Tamyb10-1 combinations.

No changes in the transcription levels of each homoeologous VRN-1 loci were found in CS-5Bdic by comparison with CS. To ascertain the loci determining heading date difference, a set of 116 recombinant inbred 5В chromosomal lines as a result of hybridization of CS with CS-5Bdic were developed and their heading dates were estimated. Using the Illumina Infinium 15 k Wheat platform, 379 5B-specific polymorphic markers were detected and a genetic map with 82 skeletal markers was constructed. Phenotype (heading date) - genotype association analysis revealed seventy eight markers in pericentromeric region of 5B chromosome significantly associated with heading date variation.

Sumai 3 (resistant) and Australian cv. Gamenya (susceptible). For microarray analysis, 3 and 7 days after inoculation (dai) samples were used in Agilent wheat custom array 4x38k. At 3 dai, the highest number of genes was up-regulated in Nobeokabouzu followed by Sumai 3 and minimum expression in Gamenya. Whereas at 7 dai, Sumai 3 expressed more genes compared to others. Further narrowing down by excluding commonly expressed genes in three genotypes and grouping according to the gene function has identified differentially high expression of genes involved in detoxification process such as multidrug resistant protein, multidrug resistance-associated protein, UDP-glycosyltransferase and ABC transporters in Nobeokabouzu at 3 dai. However in Sumai 3 many defense-related genes such as peroxidase, proteases and genes involved in plant cell wall defense at 7 dai were identified.

"26574785","abstracttext","The interaction of wheat with two ear pathogens, Magnaporthe wheat blast (MWB) and Fusarium graminearum (Fusarium head blight, FHB), was studied on the phenotypic, histological, and gene expression level. Most of the 27 wheat cultivars inoculated with MWB and F. graminearum displayed inverse disease responses to blast and FHB infection. Two cultivars, Milan and Sumai 3, were selected expressing converse disease phenotypes to blast (Milan, R)/(Sumai 3, S) and FHB (Milan, S)/(Sumai 3, R). Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed early (12 h postinoculation) colonization of the spikelets by MWB similarly on both cultivars, while F. graminearum infected anthers of the susceptible cultivar earlier. Both pathogens grew much faster in the rachilla of susceptible than resistant cultivars, indicating that resistance is mainly expressed in this part connecting the spikelet with the rachis. In general, O2(-) and H2O2 levels were unrelated to disease expression in the four studied interactions. The differential disease phenotypes, fungal spread in the rachis, and colonization patterns in the spikelets were confirmed by distinct gene expression patterns. Among the eight genes analyzed, seven were more strongly induced by FHB than by blast. Genes for chitinase (Chi2), β-1,3-glucanase (PR2), a plant defensin homolog (PRPI), and peroxidase (Pox2) were strongly upregulated in Milan in response to both pathogens, while PR2 and PR5 (thaumatin-like protein) were transiently triggered by MWB on both cultivars. Upregulation of cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR), cytochrome P450 (CYP709C1), and UDP-glycosyl transferase (UGT) were more prominent in ears infected with F. graminearum, while upregulation of UGT was higher in Sumai 3 when infected with either pathogen. Cultivar resistance to FHB was reflected by clearly higher expression levels of UGT and CYP709C1 in Sumai 3. The differential responses of wheat to the two ear pathogens demonstrated in this study makes it unlikely that common resistance genes exist for control of FHB and blast, suggesting the need to stack many genes associated with resistance in breeding programs for multiple resistance."

"27152969","abstracttext","Selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient for animals and humans and a target for biofortification in crops. Sulfur (S) is a crucial nutrient for plant growth. To gain better understanding of Se and S nutrition and interaction in plants, the effects of Se dosages and forms on plant growth as well as on S level in seven wheat lines were examined. Low dosages of both selenate and selenite supplements were found to enhance wheat shoot biomass and show no inhibitory effect on grain production. The stimulation on plant growth was correlated with increased APX antioxidant enzyme activity. Se forms were found to exert different effects on S metabolism in wheat plants. Selenate treatment promoted S accumulation, which was not observed with selenite supplement. An over threefold increase of S levels following selenate treatment at low dosages was observed in shoots of all wheat lines. Analysis of the sulfate transporter gene expression revealed an increased transcription of SULTR1;1, SULTR1;3 and SULTR4;1 in roots following 10 μM Na2 SeO4 treatment. Mass spectrometry-based targeted protein quantification confirmed the gene expression results and showed enhanced protein levels. The results suggest that Se treatment mimics S deficiency to activate specific sulfate transporter expression to stimulate S uptake, resulting in the selenate-induced S accumulation. This study supports that plant growth and nutrition benefit from low dosages of Se fertilization and provides information on the basis underlying Se-induced S accumulation in plants."

"27016249","abstracttext_main conclusion","Fructan accumulation and remobilization to grains under salinity can decrease dependency of the wheat tolerant cultivar on current photosynthesis and protect it from severe yield loss under salt stress. Tolerance of plants to abiotic stresses can be enhanced by accumulation of soluble sugars, such as fructan. The current research sheds light on the role of stem fructan remobilization on yield of bread wheat under salt stress conditions. Fructan accumulation and remobilization as well as relative expression of the major genes of fructan metabolism were investigated in the penultimate internodes of 'Bam' as the salt-tolerant and 'Ghods' as the salt-sensitive wheat cultivars under salt-stressed and controlled conditions and their correlations were analyzed. More fructan production and higher efficiency of fructan remobilization was detected in Bam cultivar under salinity. Up-regulation of sucrose: sucrose 1-fructosyltransferase (1-SST) and sucrose: fructan 6-fructosyltransferase (6-SFT) (fructan biosynthesis genes) at anthesis and up-regulation of fructan exohydrolase (1-FEH) and vacuolar invertase (IVR) genes (contributed to fructan metabolism) during grain filling stage and higher expression of sucrose transporter gene (SUT1) in Bam was in accordance with its induced fructan accumulation and remobilization under salt stress. A significant correlation was observed between weight density, WSCs and gene expression changes under salt stress. Based on the these results, increased fructan production and induced stem reserves remobilization under salinity can decrease dependency of the wheat tolerant cultivar on current photosynthesis and protect it from severe yield loss under salt stress conditions."

"27446158","abstracttext","A sub-group of class I Caseinolytic proteases (Clps) function as molecular chaperone and confer thermotolerance to plants. We identified class I Clp family consisting of five ClpB/HSP100, two ClpC, and two ClpD genes from bread wheat. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these genes were highly conserved across grass genomes. Subcellular localization prediction revealed that TaClpC and TaClpD subgroup proteins and TaClpB1 proteins are potentially targeted to chloroplast, while TaClpB5 to mitochondria, and TaClpB2, TaClpB3, and TaClpB4 to cytoplasm. Spatio-temporal expression pattern analysis revealed that four TaClpB and TaClpD2 genes are expressed in majority of all tissues and developmental stages of wheat. Real-time RT-PCR analysis of expression levels of Clp genes in seven wheat genotypes under different abiotic stresses revealed that genes coding for the cytosolic Clps namely TaClpB2 and TaClpB3 were upregulated under heat, salt and oxidative stress but were downregulated by cold stress in most genotypes. In contrast, genes coding for the chloroplastic Clps TaClpC1, TaClpC2, and TaClpD1 genes were significantly upregulated by mainly by cold stress in most genotypes, while TaClpD2 gene was upregulated >2 fold by salt stress in DBW16. The TaClpB5 gene coding for mitochondrial Clp was upregulated in all genotypes under heat, salt and oxidative stresses. In addition, we found that biotic stresses also upregulated TaClpB4 and TaClpD1. Among biotic stresses, Tilletia caries induced TaClpB2, TaClpB3, TaClpC1, and TaClpD1. Differential expression pattern under different abiotic and biotic stresses and predicted differential cellular localization of Clps suggest their non-redundant organelle and stress-specific roles. Our results also suggest the potential role of Clps in cold, salt and biotic stress responses in addition to the previously established role in thermotolerance of wheat."

"28724083","abstracttext","The wheat stem sawfly (WSS) is an economically important pest of wheat in the Northern Great Plains. The primary means of WSS control is resistance associated with the single quantitative trait locus (QTL) , which controls most stem solidness variation. The goal of this study was to identify stem solidness candidate genes via RNA-seq. This study made use of 28 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) makers derived from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) linked to contained within a 5.13 cM region. Allele specific expression of EST markers was examined in stem tissue for solid and hollow-stemmed pairs of two spring wheat near isogenic lines (NILs) differing for the QTL. Of the 28 ESTs, 13 were located within annotated genes and 10 had detectable stem expression. Annotated genes corresponding to four of the ESTs were differentially expressed between solid and hollow-stemmed NILs and represent possible stem solidness gene candidates. Further examination of the 5.13 cM region containing the 28 EST markers identified 260 annotated genes. Twenty of the 260 linked genes were up-regulated in hollow NIL stems, while only seven genes were up-regulated in solid NIL stems. An -methyltransferase within the region of interest was identified as a candidate based on differential expression between solid and hollow-stemmed NILs and putative function. Further study of these candidate genes may lead to the identification of the gene(s) controlling stem solidness and an increased ability to select for wheat stem solidness and manage WSS."

"27565953","abstracttext","Wheat is one of the most widely grown cereal crops in the world and is an important food grain source for humans. However, wheat yields can be reduced by many abiotic and biotic stress factors, including powdery mildew disease caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt). Generating resistant varieties is thus a major effort in plant breeding. Here, we took advantage of the non-transgenic Targeting Induced Lesions IN Genomes (TILLING) technology to select partial loss-of-function alleles of TaMlo, the orthologue of the barley Mlo (Mildew resistance locus o) gene. Natural and induced loss-of-function alleles (mlo) of barley Mlo are known to confer durable broad-spectrum powdery mildew resistance, typically at the expense of pleiotropic phenotypes such as premature leaf senescence. We identified 16 missense mutations in the three wheat TaMlo homoeologues, TaMlo-A1, TaMlo-B1 and TaMlo-D1 that each lead to single amino acid exchanges. Using transient gene expression assays in barley single cells, we functionally analysed the different missense mutants and identified the most promising candidates affecting powdery mildew susceptibility. By stacking of selected mutant alleles we generated four independent lines with non-conservative mutations in each of the three TaMlo homoeologues. Homozygous triple mutant lines and surprisingly also some of the homozygous double mutant lines showed enhanced, yet incomplete, Bgt resistance without the occurrence of discernible pleiotropic phenotypes. These lines thus represent an important step towards the production of commercial non-transgenic, powdery mildew-resistant bread wheat varieties."

CIMMYT-derived durum wheat line Bairds displays an adequate level of adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust in Mexican field environments. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from a cross of Bairds with susceptible parent Atred#1 was phenotyped for leaf rust response at Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, during 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016 under artificially created epidemics of Puccinia triticina (Pt) race BBG/BP. The RIL population and its parents were genotyped with the 50 K diversity arrays technology (DArT) sequence system and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A genetic map comprising 1150 markers was used to map the resistance loci. Four significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected on chromosomes 1BL, 2BC (centromere region), 5BL and 6BL. These QTLs, named Lr46, QLr.cim-2BC, QLr.cim-5BL and QLr.cim-6BL, respectively, explained 13.5-60.8%, 9.0-14.3%, 2.8-13.9%, and 11.6-29.4%, respectively, of leaf rust severity variation by the inclusive composite interval mapping method. All of these resistance loci were contributed by the resistant parent Bairds, except for QLr.cim-2BC, which came from susceptible parent Atred#1. Among these, the QTL on chromosome 1BL was the known pleiotropic APR gene Lr46, whereas QLr.cim-6BL, a consistently detected locus, should be a new leaf rust resistance locus in durum wheat. The mean leaf rust severity of RILs carrying all four QTLs ranged from 8.0 to 17.5%, whereas it ranged from 10.9 to 38.5% for three QTLs (Lr46 + 5BL + 6BL) derived from the resistant parent Bairds. Two RILs with four QTLs combinations can be used as sources of complex APR in durum wheat breeding."

For common wheat, spring frost damage frequently occurs, especially when low temperature coincides with plants at early floral organ differentiation, which may result in significant yield loss. Up to date, the role of miRNAs in wheat response to frost stress is not well understood."
"28241738","abstracttext_results","We report here the sequencing of small RNA transcriptomes from the young spikes that were treated with cold stress and the comparative analysis with those of the control. A total of 192 conserved miRNAs from 105 families and nine novel miRNAs were identified. Among them, 34 conserved and five novel miRNAs were differentially expressed between the cold-stressed samples and the controls. The expression patterns of 18 miRNAs were further validated by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Moreover, nearly half of the miRNAs were cross inducible by biotic and abiotic stresses when compared with previously published work. Target genes were predicted and validated by degradome sequencing. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs were enriched for response to the stimulus, regulation of transcription, and ion transport functions. Since many targets of differentially expressed miRNAs were transcription factors that are associated with floral development such as ARF, SPB (Squamosa Promoter Binding like protein), MADS-box (MCM1, AG, DEFA and SRF), MYB, SPX (SYG1, Pho81 and XPR1), TCP (TEOSINTE BRANCHED, Cycloidea and PCF), and PPR (PentatricoPeptide Repeat) genes, cold-altered miRNA expression may cause abnormal reproductive organ development."

"30993362","abstracttext_key message","An EMS-induced single-base mutation at a splice site caused abnormal RNA splicing and resulted in the gene inactivation and the lack of Wx-A1 protein in a wheat EMS mutant line. An EMS-mutagenized population was generated using common wheat cv. SM126 consisting of 10,600 M2 plants. One Wx-A1 null mutant was identified through analyses of 390 grains produced from 130 M2 plants using electrophoresis analyses. The Wx-A1 sequences of parental line SM126 and M2-31 mutant were determined as 2781 bp, and there was only one SNP mutation between them. The SNP was a mutation from G to A at nucleotide sequence position 2168 bp (G2168A) downstream of the start codon which was located at the splicing site within the eighth intron. All 52 cDNA transcripts were found to be incorrectly spliced and can be summarized as five types of variations. The deletion of the exon and the exclusion of intron were structural features in abnormal splicing RNA. Together with the prediction of potential splice regulatory motifs, the mutation G2168A happened within the 5' splice site of the eighth intron and destroyed the splice donor site from GU to AU, which may have brought about a barrier against correct RNA splice, and generated abnormal mRNA, which was the mechanism of the inactivation of Wx-A1 in M2-31. The lack of Wx-A1 has resulted in changes in starch properties in the M2-31 mutant, with the reduction in amylose and starch contents. The increased grains hardness was observed in M2-31, which may be related to the lower expression level of Pinb-D1 gene. As the waxy wheat foods have a lot of advantages, the null waxy genes will be widely applied in breeding waxy wheat for varied amylose contents."

In this study, a segregating population of 118 recombinant inbred lines, derived from a cross between the Iranian durum landrace accession ""Iran_249"" and the Iranian durum cultivar ""Zardak"", was used to investigate durum wheat kernel morphology factors and their relationships with kernel weight, and to map the corresponding QTLs. A high density genetic map, based on wheat 90k iSelect Infinium SNP assay, comprising 6,195 markers, was developed and used to perform the QTL analysis for kernel length and width, traits related to kernel shape and weight, and heading date, using phenotypic data from three environments. Overall, a total of 31 different QTLs and 9 QTL interactions for kernel size, and 21 different QTLs and 5 QTL interactions for kernel shape were identified. The landrace Iran_249 contributed the allele with positive effect for most of the QTLs related to kernel length and kernel weight suggesting that the landrace might have considerable potential toward enhancing the existing gene pool for grain shape and size traits and for further yield improvement in wheat. The correlation among traits and co-localization of corresponding QTLs permitted to define 11 clusters suggesting causal relationships between simplest kernel size trait, like kernel length and width, and more complex secondary trait, like kernel shape and weight related traits. Lastly, the recent release of the T. durum reference genome sequence allowed to define the physical interval of our QTL/clusters and to hypothesize novel candidate genes inspecting the gene content of the genomic regions associated to target traits."

To decipher the genetic architecture of FHB resistance in Chinese germplasm, a Wheat Association Panel for Scab Research (WAPS) consisting of 240 leading Chinese wheat cultivars and elite lines was genotyped using the 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. The FHB response was evaluated in the field nurseries in Wuhan in Hubei Province over four consecutive years from 2014 to 2017. Five quantitative trait loci (QTL) were consistently identified on chromosome arms 1AS, 2DL, 5AS, 5AL, and 7DS using a mixed linear model (MLM), explaining 5.6, 10.3, 5.7, 5.4, and 5.6% of phenotypic variation, respectively. The QTL on 5AS, 5AL, and 7DS QTL are probably novel. The allelic frequency analysis indicated that cultivars from the Middle and Lower Yangtze River Valleys harbored more favorable alleles and were therefore more resistant than those from other regions. To facilitate in-house germplasm screening and marker-assisted selection (MAS), SNP-derived PCR markers were developed for the QTL regions on 1AS, 5AS, and 5AL QTL. In addition to the above five QTL, the WAPS population had a very low frequency of Fhb1 , confirming that the gene is not widely used in Chinese wheat breeding programs. The resistant lines and molecular markers developed in this study are resources and information for enhancing FHB resistance in breeding populations by marker-assisted recurrent selection and gene stacking."

"32295768","abstracttext","G-quadruplexes are nucleic acid secondary structures formed by a stack of square planar G-quartets. G-quadruplexes were implicated in many biological functions including telomere maintenance, replication, transcription, and translation, in many species including humans and plants. For wheat, however, though it is one of the world's most important staple food, no G-quadruplex studies have been reported to date. Here, we computationally identify putative G4 structures (G4s) in wheat genome for the first time and compare its distribution across the genome against five other genomes (human, maize, Arabidopsis, rice, and sorghum). We identified close to 1 million G4 motifs with a density of 76 G4s/Mb across the whole genome and 93 G4s/Mb over genic regions. Remarkably, G4s were enriched around three regions, two located on the antisense and one on the sense strand at the following positions: 1) the transcription start site (TSS) (antisense), 2) the first coding domain sequence (CDS) (antisense), and 3) the start codon (sense). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the gene models containing G4 motifs within these peaks were associated with specific gene ontology (GO) terms, such as developmental process, localization, and cellular component organization or biogenesis. We investigated genes encoding MADS-box transcription factors and showed examples of G4 motifs within critical regulatory regions in the VRN-1 genes in wheat. Furthermore, comparison with other plants showed that monocots share a similar distribution of G4s, but Arabidopsis shows a unique G4 distribution. Our study shows for the first time the prevalence and possible functional roles of G4s in wheat."

"32488301","abstracttext_key message","This study dissected and validated a QTL cluster associated with thousand grain weight on chromosome 4B using multiple near-isogenic lines in common wheat. Grain size and weight are crucial components of wheat yield. Previously, we identified a QTL cluster for thousand grain weight (TGW) on chromosome 4B using the Nongda3338 (ND3338)/Jingdong6 (JD6) doubled haploid population. Here, near-isogenic lines (NILs) in the ND3338 background were developed to dissect and validate the QTL cluster. Based on six independent BC 3 F 3:4 heterogeneous inbred families, the 4B QTL cluster was divided into two linked QTL intervals (designated 4B.1 and 4B.2 QTL). For the 4B.1 QTL, the Rht-B1 gene, of which Rht-B1b allele reduces plant height (PH) by 21.18-29.34 cm (34.34-53.71%), was demonstrated to be the most likely candidate gene with pleiotropic effects on grain size and TGW. For the 4B.2 QTL, the NIL JD6 consistently showed an increase in TGW of 3.51-7.68 g (8.84-22.77%) compared with NIL ND3338 across different field trials, along with a significant increase in PH of 2.26-6.71 cm (3.92-12.01%). Moreover, both QTL intervals had a larger effect on grain width than on grain length. Additionally, the first significant difference in 100-grain fresh weight and 100-grain dry weight between the NIL pairs of the 4B.1 QTL interval (Rht-B1) was observed at 6 days after pollination (DAP), while the differences were first visible at 30 DAP for the 4B.2 QTL interval. Collectively, our work provides a new example of QTL dissection for grain weight in wheat and lays a foundation for further map-based cloning of the major QTL that have potential applications in wheat molecular breeding for high yield."

However, these sources of resistance have not yet been successfully used in commercial wheat cultivars. The development of small segment translocation chromosomes carrying resistance may result in lines carrying the 6R chromosome becoming more commercially acceptable. However, no wheat-rye 6RL small segment translocation line with powdery mildew resistance has been reported. In this study, a wheat-rye 6RL Ku minichromosome addition line with powdery mildew resistance was identified, and this minichromosome was derived from the segment between L2.5 and L2.8 of the 6RL Ku chromosome arm. Following irradiation, the 6RL Ku minichromosome divided into two smaller segments, named 6RL Kumi200 and 6RL Kumi119 , and these fragments participated in the formation of wheat-rye small segment translocation chromosomes 6DS/6RL Kumi200 and 6DL/6RL Kumi119 , respectively. The powdery mildew resistance gene was found to be located on the 6RL Kumi119 segment. Sixteen 6RL Kumi119 -specific markers were developed, and their products were cloned and sequenced. Nucleotide BLAST searches indicated that 14 of the 16 sequences had 91⁻100% similarity with nine scaffolds derived from 6R chromosome of S. cereale L. Lo7. The small segment translocation chromosome 6DL/6RL Kumi119 makes the practical utilization in agriculture of powdery mildew resistance gene on 6RL Ku more likely. The nine scaffolds are useful for further studying the structure and function of this small segment."

"30764215","abstracttext","The stem rust resistance gene Sr36 confers a near-immune resistance reaction to many races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici and is highly effective against race TTKSK (syn. Ug99), which possesses unusually broad virulence combinations. Because this gene is widely used in United States soft winter wheat germplasm and cultivars, it has been considered to be an important source of resistance to TTKSK. In 2007, moderately susceptible infection responses were observed on wheat lines and cultivars carrying Sr36 in a field screening nursery for stem rust at Njoro, Kenya. We derived 18 single-pustule isolates from stem rust samples collected from the 2007 Njoro nursery. The isolates were evaluated for virulence on 20 North American stem rust differential lines and on wheat lines and cultivars carrying Sr36, Sr31+Sr36, and Sr24+Sr31. Of the 18 isolates, 10 produced infection types 3+ to 4 on line W2691SrTt-1 (monogenic for Sr36) and other lines that carry Sr36 and belonged to a new virulence phenotype that was not detected in previous years. These isolates were identified as race TTTSK. The remaining eight isolates were identified as races TTKSK (five isolates) and TTKST (three isolates), with avirulence and virulence, respectively, to Sr24. Thirteen simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to examine the genetic relationships among the three races in the TTKS lineage. All isolates in the lineage shared an identical SSR genotype and were clearly different from North American races. In all, 16 wheat cultivars and 60 elite breeding lines, postulated to possess Sr36, were susceptible to race TTTSK. The occurrence of race TTTSK with combined virulence on Sr31 and Sr36 has further broadened the virulence spectrum of the TTKS lineage and rendered an important source of resistance ineffective."

"30887143","abstracttext","Genetic mutations in genes governing wheat threshability were critical for domestication. Knowing when these genes mutated during wheat evolution will provide more insight into the domestication process and lead to further exploitation of primitive alleles for wheat improvement. We evaluated a population of recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between the durum variety Rusty and the cultivated emmer accession PI 193883 for threshability, rachis fragility, and other spike-related traits. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with spike length, spikelets per spike, and spike compactness were primarily associated with known genes such as the pleiotropic domestication gene Q. Interestingly, rachis fragility was not associated with the Q locus, suggesting that this trait, usually a pleiotropic effect of the q allele, can be influenced by the genetic background. Threshability QTL were identified on chromosome arms 2AS, 2BS, and 5AL corresponding to the tenacious glume genes Tg 2A and Tg 2B as well as the Q gene, respectively, further demonstrating that cultivated emmer harbors the primitive non-free-threshing alleles at all three loci. Genetic analysis indicated that the effects of the three genes are mostly additive, with Q having the most profound effects on threshability, and that free-threshing alleles are necessary at all three loci to attain a completely free-threshing phenotype. These findings provide further insight into the timeline and possible pathways of wheat domestication and evolution that led to the formation of modern day domesticated wheats."

The obligate biotrophic fungal pathogen changes its virulence rapidly, which can circumvent resistance in wheat cultivars and cause severe epidemics. Because P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races have been identified in the United States using different wheat genotypes in different time periods, it is difficult to make direct comparisons of the current population with historical populations. The objective of this study was to characterize historical populations with 18 Yr single-gene lines that are currently used to differentiate P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races in order to understand virulence and race changes of the pathogen over 40 years in the United States. From 908 P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates collected from 1968 to 2009 in the United States, 171 races were identified and their frequencies were determined. More races, more new races, and races with more virulence genes were detected since the year 2000 than prior to 2000. None of the races were virulent to Yr5 and Yr15, indicating that these genes have been effective since the late 1960s. Virulence genes to the remaining 16 Yr genes were detected in different periods, and most of them increased in frequency over time. Some virulence genes such as those to Yr17, Yr27, Yr32, Yr43, Yr44, YrTr1, and YrExp2 appeared 14 to 37 years earlier than previously reported, indicating the greater value of using Yr single-gene lines as differentials. Positive and negative associations were detected between virulence genes. The continual information on virulence and races in the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici populations is useful for understanding the evolution of the pathogen and for breeding wheat cultivars with effective resistance to stripe rust."

Because of its effectiveness against the disease, this study was initiated to finely map Pm52 using the comparative genomics analysis approach and the wheat reference genomic sequence. Based on the EST sequences that were located in the chromosome region flanking Pm52, four EST-SSR markers were developed, and another nine SSR markers were developed using the comparative genomics technology. These thirteen markers were integrated into a genetic linkage map using an F 2:3 subpopulation of the Liangxing 99 × Zhongzuo 9504 cross. Pm52 was mapped within a 3.2-cM genetic interval in the subpopulation that corresponded to a ~40-Mb genomic interval on chromosome arm 2BL of the Chinese Spring reference genome. The Pm52-flanking markers Xicsl163 and Xicsl62 identified 344 recombinant individuals from 8820 F 2 plants. Nine SSR markers generated from the Chinese Spring genomic interval were incorporated into a high-resolution genetic linkage map, which placed Pm52 in a 0.21-cM genetic interval corresponding to 5.6-Mb genomic region.

"32719694","abstracttext","Global climate change, its implications for agriculture, and the complex scenario presented by the scientific community are of worldwide concern. Drought is a major abiotic stress that can restrict plants growth and yields, thus the identification of genotypes with higher adaptability to drought stress represents one of the primary goals in breeding programs. During abiotic stress, metabolic adaptation is crucial for stress tolerance, and accumulation of specific amino acids and/or as secondary metabolites deriving from amino acid metabolism may correlate with the increased tolerance to adverse environmental conditions. This work, focused on the metabolism of branched chain-amino acids (BCAAs) in durum wheat and the role of branched-chain amino acid aminotransferases (BCATs) in stress response. The role of BCATs in plant response to drought was previously proposed for Arabidopsis , where the levels of BCAAs were altered at the transcriptional level under drought conditions, triggering the onset of defense response metabolism. However, in wheat the role of BCAAs as a trigger of the onset of the drought defense response has not been elucidated. A comparative genomic approach elucidated the composition of the BCAT gene family in durum wheat. Here we demonstrate a tissue and developmental stage specificity of BCATs regulation in the drought response. Moreover, a metabolites profiling was performed on two contrasting durum wheat cultivars Colosseo and Cappelli resulting in the detection of a specific pattern of metabolites accumulated among genotypes and, in particular, in an enhanced BCAAs accumulation in the tolerant cv Cappelli further supporting a role of BCAAs in the drought defense response. The results support the use of gene expression and target metabolomic in modern breeding to shape new cultivars more resilient to a changing climate."

"32993508","abstracttext_results","In this study, we analyzed the expression profiles of 97 WRKY transcription factors (TFs) throughout the progression of leaf senescence in wheat and subsequently isolated a potential regulator of leaf senescence, TaWRKY42-B, for further functional investigation. By phenotypic and physiological analyses in TaWRKY42-B-overexpressing Arabidopsis plants and TaWRKY42-B-silenced wheat plants, we confirmed the positive role of TaWRKY42-B in the initiation of developmental and dark-induced leaf senescence. Furthermore, our results revealed that TaWRKY42-B promotes leaf senescence mainly by interacting with a JA biosynthesis gene, AtLOX3, and its ortholog, TaLOX3, which consequently contributes to the accumulation of JA content. In the present study, we also demonstrated that TaWRKY42-B was functionally conserved with AtWRKY53 in the initiation of age-dependent leaf senescence."

"19308413","abstracttext","Hexaploid wheat, one of the world's most important staple crops, remains a challenge for genetic transformation. We are developing a floral transformation protocol for wheat that does not require tissue culture. This paper presents three transformants in the hard red germplasm line Crocus that have been characterized thoroughly at the molecular level over three to six generations. Wheat spikes at the early boot stage, i.e. the early, mid or late uninucleate microspore stages, were immersed in an infiltration medium of strain C58C1 harboring pDs(Hyg)35S, or strain AGL1 harboring pBECKSred. pDs(Hyg)35S contains the NPTII and hph selectable markers, and transformants were detected using paromomycin spray at the whole plant level, NPTII ELISAs, or selection on medium with hygromycin. Strain AGL1, harboring pBECKSred, which contains the maize anthocyanin regulators, Lc and C1, and the NPTII gene, was also used to produce a Crocus transformant. T1 and T2 seeds with red embryos were selected; T1 and T2 plants were screened by sequential tests for paromomycin resistance and NPTII ELISAs. The transformants were low copy number and showed Mendelian segregation in the T2. Stable transmission of the transgenes over several generations has been demonstrated using Southern analysis. Gene expression in advanced progeny was shown using Reverse Transcriptase-PCR and ELISA assays for NPTII protein expression. This protocol has the potential to reduce the time and expense required for wheat transformation."

"19582226","abstracttext","The wild wheat Aegilops tauschii Coss. has extensive natural variation available for breeding of common wheat. Drought stress tolerance is closely related to abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity. In this study, 17 synthetic hexaploid wheat lines, produced by crossing the tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon with 17 accessions of Ae. tauschii, were used for comparative analysis of natural variation in drought tolerance and ABA sensitivity. Ae. tauschii showed wide natural variation, with weak association between the traits. Drought-sensitive accessions of Ae. tauschii exhibited significantly less ABA sensitivity. D-genome variations observed at the diploid genome level were not necessarily reflected in synthetic wheats. However, synthetic wheats derived from the parental Ae. tauschii accessions with high drought tolerance were significantly more tolerant to drought stress than those from drought-sensitive accessions. Moreover, synthetic wheats with high drought tolerance showed significantly higher ABA sensitivity than drought-sensitive synthetic lines. In the hexaploid genetic background, therefore, weak association of ABA sensitivity with drought tolerance was observed. To study differences in gene expression patterns between stress-tolerant and -sensitive lines, levels of two Cor/Lea and three transcription factor gene transcripts were compared. The more tolerant accession of Ae. tauschii tended to accumulate more abundant transcripts of the examined genes than the sensitive accession under stress conditions. The expression patterns in the synthetic wheats seemed to be additive for parental lines exposed to drought and ABA treatments. However, the transcript levels of transcription factor genes in the synthetic wheats did not necessarily correspond to the postulated levels based on expression in parental lines. Allopolyploidization altered the expression levels of the stress-responsive genes in synthetic wheats."

"31940871","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in the world. Genetic resistance is the best strategy for control of the disease. Spring wheat landrace PI 181410 has shown high level resistance to stripe rust. The present study characterized the landrace to have both race-specific all-stage resistance and nonrace-specific high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance. To map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for the resistance in PI 181410, it was crossed with Avocet S (AvS), from which a recombinant inbred line population was developed. The F 5 -F 8 populations were consecutively phenotyped for stripe rust response in multiple field environments under natural Pst infection, and the F 7 population was phenotyped in seedlings at low temperature and in adult-plant stage with selected Pst races in the greenhouse. The F 7 population was genotyped using the 90K wheat SNP chip. Three QTL, QYrPI181410.wgp-4AS , QYrPI181410.wgp-4BL , and QYrPI181410.wgp-5BL .1, from PI 181410 for all-stage resistance, were mapped on chromosome arms 4AS, 4BL, and 5BL, respectively. Four QTL, QYrPI181410.wgp-1BL , QYrPI181410.wgp-4BL , QYrPI181410.wgp-5AS , and QYrPI181410.wgp-5BL.2 , were identified from PI 181410 for HTAP resistance and mapped to 1BL, 4BL, 5AS, and 5BL, respectively. Two QTL with minor effects on stripe rust response were identified from AvS and mapped to 2BS and 2BL. Four of the QTL from PI 181410 and one from AvS were potentially new. As the 4BL QTL was most effective and likely a new gene for stripe rust resistance, three kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) markers were developed for incorporating this gene into new wheat cultivars."

The success of FHB resistance breeding relies on identification of an effective resistant germplasm. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using the high-density wheat 90 K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) assays to better understand the genetic basis of FHB resistance in natural population and identify associated molecular markers."

Using Illumina Infinum iSelect 90 K SNP genotyping data, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified 26 loci (88 marker-trait associations), which explained 6.65-14.18% of the phenotypic variances. The associated loci distributed across all chromosomes except 2D, 6A, 6D and 7D, with those on chromosomes 1B, 4A, 5D and 7A being detected in both years. New loci for Type II resistance were found on syntenic genomic regions of chromsome 4AL (QFhb-4AL, 621.85-622.24 Mb) and chromosome 5DL (QFhb-5DL, 546.09-547.27 Mb) which showed high collinearity in gene content and order. SNP markers wsnp_JD_c4438_5568170 and wsnp_CAP11_c209_198467 of 5D, reported previously linked to a soil-borne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) resistance gene, were also associated with FHB resistance in this study."

"32032990","articletitle","Crop types have stronger effects on soil microbial communities and functionalities than biochar or fertilizer during two cycles of legume-cereal rotations of dry land."
"32032990","abstracttext","The addition of biochar to agricultural fields has been widely studied, but most of these studies have emphasized its effects by growing a single type of crop over short- to long-term time spans. Additionally, a limited number of studies have focused on the soil microbial community composition with respect to biochar addition in legume-cereal crop rotation. In this study, we examined soil microbial community structures by adding biochar (0, 5, and 10 t ha - 1 ) and fertilizer (nitrogen-N, phosphorous-P and potassium-K) during 2 cycles of mash bean and wheat rotations. The results showed that the bacterial (16S rRNA) gene abundance was often increased by biochar addition in the presence of mash bean (Vigna mungo L.) but not wheat. When the soil received fertilizer, the bacterial gene abundance was less responsive to biochar addition. Fungal (ITS rRNA) copy numbers were enhanced by biochar and fertilizer in presence of wheat but were decreased in the presence of mash bean. Fertilizer addition also resulted in less change in ITS genes after biochar addition. Microbial functional groups including Gram + , Gram - and Pseudomonas bacteria were stimulated by biochar or fertilizer only in mash bean soils, while mycorrhizae were significantly increased by biochar in wheat soils. Although biochar addition affected soil properties, microbial community assays were not greatly altered by these physicochemical properties. In conclusion, the crop type played a decisive role, rather than biochar or fertilizer addition, in shaping microbial community structures (16S and ITS phyla) during crop rotation."

"32830594","abstracttext","Plant resistance inducers are among the most promising alternatives to develop sustainable crop protection. Here, we examined the ability of saccharin, a metabolite derived from probenazole, to protect wheat against Zymoseptoria tritici, the most frequently occurring and damaging foliar pathogen on this crop. The experiments were performed in the greenhouse by treating seedlings of the wheat cv. Alixan with 15 mM saccharin two days before challenge inoculation with the Z. tritici pathogenic strain T02596. Foliar application of saccharin resulted in 77 % disease severity reduction when compared to non-treated control plants. In vitro and in planta assays showed that saccharin did not exhibit any direct antifungal effect, neither on spore germination, nor on hyphal growth. Molecular investigations from 2 to 7 days post-treatment (dpt) revealed that saccharin treatment up-regulates the expression of genes encoding for lipoxygenase (LOX) at all sampled time-points and pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) at 7 dpt, in both non-infectious and infectious contexts, as well as peroxidase (POX2) in non-infectious conditions. However, saccharin did not induce significant change in the expression of PAL gene encoding for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. Our findings report for the first time the potential of saccharin to confer protection in wheat against Z. tritici through an elicitation and priming of LOX and PR gene-related defense pathways. Further investigations would provide a better deciphering of defense mechanisms activated by this molecule in wheat against Z. tritici."
"31506307","articletitle","Transposon-Mediated Horizontal Transfer of the Host-Specific Virulence Protein ToxA between Three Fungal Wheat Pathogens."
"31506307","abstracttext","Most known examples of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between eukaryotes are ancient. These events are identified primarily using phylogenetic methods on coding regions alone. Only rarely are there examples of HGT where noncoding DNA is also reported. The gene encoding the wheat virulence protein ToxA and the surrounding 14 kb is one of these rare examples. ToxA has been horizontally transferred between three fungal wheat pathogens ( Parastagonospora nodorum , Pyrenophora tritici- repentis , and Bipolaris sorokiniana ) as part of a conserved ∼14 kb element which contains coding and noncoding regions. Here we used long-read sequencing to define the extent of HGT between these three fungal species. Construction of near-chromosomal-level assemblies enabled identification of terminal inverted repeats on either end of the 14 kb region, typical of a type II DNA transposon. This is the first description of ToxA with complete transposon features, which we call ToxhAT. In all three species, ToxhAT resides in a large (140-to-250 kb) transposon-rich genomic island which is absent in isolates that do not carry the gene (annotated here as toxa - ). We demonstrate that the horizontal transfer of ToxhAT between P. tritici-repentis and P. nodorum occurred as part of a large (∼80 kb) HGT which is now undergoing extensive decay. In B. sorokiniana , in contrast, ToxhAT and its resident genomic island are mobile within the genome. Together, these data provide insight into the noncoding regions that facilitate HGT between eukaryotes and into the genomic processes which mask the extent of HGT between these species. IMPORTANCE This work dissects the tripartite horizontal transfer of ToxA , a gene that has a direct negative impact on global wheat yields. Defining the extent of horizontally transferred DNA is important because it can provide clues to the mechanisms that facilitate HGT. Our analysis of ToxA and its surrounding 14 kb suggests that this gene was horizontally transferred in two independent events, with one event likely facilitated by a type II DNA transposon. These horizontal transfer events are now in various processes of decay in each species due to the repeated insertion of new transposons and subsequent rounds of targeted mutation by a fungal genome defense mechanism known as repeat induced point mutation. This work highlights the role that HGT plays in the evolution of host adaptation in eukaryotic pathogens. It also increases the growing body of evidence indicating that transposons facilitate adaptive HGT events between fungi present in similar environments and hosts."

In this study, we aimed to reveal the structure and diversity of dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes in wild emmer wheat from Israel and to elucidate the relationship between the emmer wheat genes and ecological factors using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Another objective of this study was to find out whether there were any correlations between SNPs in functional protein-coding genes and the environment."
"18366725","abstracttext_results","The influence of ecological factors on the genetic structure of dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes was evaluated by specific SNP markers. A total of 244 dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitor genes were obtained from 13 accessions in 10 populations. Seventy-five polymorphic positions and 74 haplotypes were defined by sequence analysis. Sixteen out of the 75 SNP markers were designed to detect SNP variations in wild emmer wheat accessions from different populations in Israel. The proportion of polymorphic loci P (5%), the expected heterozygosity He, and Shannon's information index in the 16 populations were 0.887, 0.404, and 0.589, respectively. The populations of wild emmer wheat showed great diversity in gene loci both between and within populations. Based on the SNP marker data, the genetic distance of pair-wise comparisons of the 16 populations displayed a sharp genetic differentiation over long geographic distances. The values of P, He, and Shannon's information index were negatively correlated with three climatic moisture factors, whereas the same values were positively correlated by Spearman rank correlation coefficients' analysis with some of the other ecological factors."
"18366725","abstracttext_conclusion","The populations of wild emmer wheat showed a wide range of diversity in dimeric alpha-amylase inhibitors, both between and within populations. We suggested that SNP markers are useful for the estimation of genetic diversity of functional genes in wild emmer wheat. These results show significant correlations between SNPs in the alpha-amylase inhibitor genes and ecological factors affecting diversity. Ecological factors, singly or in combination, explained a significant proportion of the variations in the SNPs, and the SNPs could be classified into several categories as ecogeographical predictors. It was suggested that the SNPs in the alpha-amylase inhibitor genes have been subjected to natural selection, and ecological factors had an important evolutionary influence on gene differentiation at specific loci."

"19480707","abstracttext_background","Natural antisense transcripts (NATs) are transcripts of the opposite DNA strand to the sense-strand either at the same locus (cis-encoded) or a different locus (trans-encoded). They can affect gene expression at multiple stages including transcription, RNA processing and transport, and translation. NATs give rise to sense-antisense transcript pairs and the number of these identified has escalated greatly with the availability of DNA sequencing resources and public databases. Traditionally, NATs were identified by the alignment of full-length cDNAs or expressed sequence tags to genome sequences, but an alternative method for large-scale detection of sense-antisense transcript pairs involves the use of microarrays. In this study we developed a novel protocol to assay sense- and antisense-strand transcription on the 55 K Affymetrix GeneChip Wheat Genome Array, which is a 3' in vitro transcription (3'IVT) expression array. We selected five different tissue types for assay to enable maximum discovery, and used the 'Chinese Spring' wheat genotype because most of the wheat GeneChip probe sequences were based on its genomic sequence. This study is the first report of using a 3'IVT expression array to discover the expression of natural sense-antisense transcript pairs, and may be considered as proof-of-concept."
"19480707","abstracttext_results","By using alternative target preparation schemes, both the sense- and antisense-strand derived transcripts were labeled and hybridized to the Wheat GeneChip. Quality assurance verified that successful hybridization did occur in the antisense-strand assay. A stringent threshold for positive hybridization was applied, which resulted in the identification of 110 sense-antisense transcript pairs, as well as 80 potentially antisense-specific transcripts. Strand-specific RT-PCR validated the microarray observations, and showed that antisense transcription is likely to be tissue specific. For the annotated sense-antisense transcript pairs, analysis of the gene ontology terms showed a significant over-representation of transcripts involved in energy production. These included several representations of ATP synthase, photosystem proteins and RUBISCO, which indicated that photosynthesis is likely to be regulated by antisense transcripts."

The results show that antisense transcription is relatively abundant in wheat, and may affect the expression of valuable agronomic phenotypes. Future work should select potentially interesting transcript pairs for further functional characterization to determine biological activity."

Three pathovars, X. translucens pv. undulosa, X. translucens pv. translucens and X. translucens pv.cerealis, have been described as pathogens of wheat, barley, and oats. However, no complete genome sequence for a strain of this complex is currently available."
"26729225","abstracttext_results","A complete genome sequence of X. translucens pv. undulosa strain XT4699 was obtained by using PacBio long read, single molecule, real time (SMRT) DNA sequences and Illumina sequences. Draft genome sequences of nineteen additional X. translucens strains, which were collected from wheat or barley in different regions and at different times, were generated by Illumina sequencing. Phylogenetic relationships among different Xanthomonas strains indicates that X. translucens are members of a distinct clade from so-called group 2 xanthomonads and three pathovars of this species, undulosa, translucens and cerealis, represent distinct subclades in the group 1 clade. Knockout mutation of type III secretion system of XT4699 eliminated the ability to cause water-soaking symptoms on wheat and barley and resulted in a reduction in populations on wheat in comparison to the wild type strain. Sequence comparison of X. translucens strains revealed the genetic variation on type III effector repertories among different pathovars or within one pathovar. The full genome sequence of XT4699 reveals the presence of eight members of the Transcription-Activator Like (TAL) effector genes, which are phylogenetically distant from previous known TAL effector genes of group 2 xanthomonads. Microarray and qRT-PCR analyses revealed TAL effector-specific wheat gene expression modulation."

"31143198","articletitle","The Effect of Plant Genotype, Growth Stage, and Mycosphaerella graminicola Strains on the Efficiency and Durability of Wheat-Induced Resistance by Paenibacillus sp. Strain B2."
"31143198","abstracttext","Plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria are known as potential biofertilizers and plant-resistance inducers. The current work aims to study the durability of the resistance induced as a response to the inoculation of wheat grains with Paenibacillus sp. strain B2 (PB2) and its influence by plant genotype, growth stage, and Mycosphaerella graminicola strain (the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch or STB). The results of the plate-counting method showed that PB2 has high potential for wheat-root external colonization [>10 6 colony-forming unit (CFU)/g of root], and the quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis demonstrated its internal root-colonization capacity on all tested cultivars. However, the colonization seems to be dependent on wheat-growth stage. The durability of PB2-induced resistance (PB2-IR) was tested at the 3-leaf, tillering, and flag-leaf-growth stages. Additionally, the results showed that the PB2-IR is durable and able to protect the flag leaf, the most important leaf layer during grain fill. It conferred a high protection efficiency (55-94%) against four virulent strains of M. graminicola and over 11 wheat cultivars with different resistance levels to STB. Although, PB2-IR is dependent on M. graminicola strains, wheat genotypes and growth stages, its efficiency, under field conditions, at protecting the last wheat-leaf layers was not an influence. However, it showed 71-79% of protection and reached 81-94% in association with half of the recommended dose of Cherokee ® fungicide. This may be explained using laboratory results by its direct impact on M. graminicola strains in these leaf layers and by the indirect reduction of the inoculum coming from leaves infected during the earlier growth stages. Gene expression results showed that PB2-IR is correlated to upregulation of genes involved in defense and cell rescue and a priming effect in the basal defense, jasmonic acid signaling, phenylpropanoids and phytoalexins, and reactive oxygen species gene markers. To conclude, PB2 induces a high and durable resistance against M. graminicola under controlled and field conditions. The PB2-IR is a pathogen strain and is plant-growth-stage and genotype dependent. These results highlight the importance of taking into consideration these factors so as to avoid losing the effectiveness of induced resistance under field conditions."

"30319682","abstracttext","Two groups of six spring bread wheat varieties with either high or low grain yield under the dry conditions of Central and Northern Kazakhstan were selected for analysis. Experiments were set up with the selected wheat varieties in controlled environments as follows: (1) slowly progressing drought imposed on plants in soil, (2) rapid dehydration of whole plants grown in hydroponics, (3) dehydration of detached leaves, and (4) ABA treatment of whole plants grown in hydroponics. Representatives of two different families of transcription factors (TFs), TaDREB5 and TaNFYC-A7 , were found to be linked to yield-under-drought using polymorphic Amplifluor-like SNP marker assays. qRT-PCR revealed differing patterns of expression of these genes in the leaves of plants subjected to the above treatments. Under drought, TaDREB5 was significantly up-regulated in leaves of all high-yielding varieties tested and down-regulated in all low-yielding varieties, and the level of expression was independent of treatment type. In contrast, TaNFYC-A7 expression levels showed different responses in the high- and low-yield groups of wheat varieties. TaNFYC-A7 expression under dehydration (treatments 2 and 3) was higher than under drought (treatment 1) in all high-yielding varieties tested, while in all low-yielding varieties the opposite pattern was observed: the expression levels of this gene under drought were higher than under dehydration. Rapid dehydration of detached leaves and intact wheat plants grown in hydroponics produced similar changes in gene expression. ABA treatment of whole plants caused rapid stomatal closure and a rise in the transcript level of both genes during the first 30 min, which decreased 6 h after treatment. At this time-point, expression of TaNFYC-A7 was again significantly up-regulated compared to untreated controls, while TaDREB5 returned to its initial level of expression. These findings reveal significant differences in the transcriptional regulation of two drought-responsive and ABA-dependent TFs under slowly developing drought and rapid dehydration of wheat plants. The results obtained suggest that correlation between grain yield in dry conditions and TaNFYC-A7 expression levels in the examined wheat varieties is dependent on the length of drought development and/or strength of drought; while in the case of TaDREB5 , no such dependence is observed."

"31316485","abstracttext","Truffle fungi are well known for their enticing aromas partially emitted by microbes colonizing truffle fruiting bodies. The identity and diversity of these microbes remain poorly investigated, because few studies have determined truffle-associated bacterial communities while considering only a small number of fruiting bodies. Hence, the factors driving the assembly of truffle microbiomes are yet to be elucidated. Here we investigated the bacterial community structure of more than 50 fruiting bodies of the black truffle Tuber aestivum in one French and one Swiss orchard using 16S rRNA gene amplicon high-throughput sequencing. Bacterial communities from truffles collected in both orchards shared their main dominant taxa: while 60% of fruiting bodies were dominated by α-Proteobacteria, in some cases the β-Proteobacteria or the Sphingobacteriia classes were the most abundant, suggesting that specific factors (i.e., truffle maturation and soil properties) shape differently truffle-associated microbiomes. We further attempted to assess the influence in truffle microbiome variation of factors related to collection season, truffle mating type, degree of maturation, and location within the truffle orchards. These factors had differential effects between the two truffle orchards, with season being the strongest predictor of community variation in the French orchard, and spatial location in the Swiss one. Surprisingly, genotype and fruiting body maturation did not have a significant effect on microbial community composition. In summary, our results show, regardless of the geographical location considered, the existence of heterogeneous bacterial communities within T. aestivum fruiting bodies that are dominated by three bacterial classes. They also indicate that factors shaping microbial communities within truffle fruiting bodies differ across local conditions."

"1429736","abstracttext","The beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) synthase I in the plant fatty acid synthetase catalyzes the condensations of acetate units to a growing acyl-ACP leading to the synthesis of palmitoyl-ACP. Barley chloroplasts contain three cerulenin sensitive beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I isoforms, alpha 2, alpha beta, and beta 2. The Kas12 gene encoding the beta 2 isozyme has been isolated and sequenced. The gene spans 3.8 kilobases and contains seven exons separated by six intervening sequences varying from 75 to 1008 base pairs in length. The mosaic gene structure is different compared with that of the beta-ketoacyl synthase in the multifunctional rat and goose fatty acid synthetases. Southern blot analyses of genomic DNA from barley, wheat, and the barley-wheat chromosome addition lines indicate that Kas12 is a single copy gene located on chromosome 2. Primer extension analyses identified four transcription start sites located 168-171 nucleotides upstream from the translation initiation codon. The Kas12 promoter lacks an appropriately positioned TATA box and contains a GC-rich region including two GC elements similar to the Sp1 transcription factor-binding site. In this regard Kas12 closely resembles a set of ubiquitously expressed eucaryotic genes. In accord with this deduction, polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the Kas12 transcript is present in barley roots, germinating embryos, developing kernels, and leaves."

"2472398","abstracttext","Wheat germ RNA polymerase II was used to raise monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that cross-react with the largest subunit of calf thymus RNA polymerase II. Most of these mAbs were of the IgM isotype and were shown to react with a synthetic peptide containing the consensus sequence for the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat that has been found on the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II from a variety of eukaryotic organisms. A representative mAb (3WG2) was tested for its effect on transcription in both in vitro and in vivo systems. Antibody 3WG2 did not affect the transcription (elongation) of wheat germ RNA polymerase II on denatured calf thymus DNA. When HeLa cell nuclear extracts were preincubated with the mAb, run-off transcription from a promoter that contains a TATA box (the adenovirus-2 major late promoter) and from a promoter that does not contain a TATA box (the murine dihydrofolate reductase gene promoter = dhfr) was inhibited. Transcription from these promoters was also inhibited by the synthetic peptide containing the consensus sequence when it was conjugated to bovine serum albumin. HeLa cell nuclear extract in which the endogenous RNA polymerase II had been inhibited by the specific mAb was used to examine the ability of added mammalian RNA polymerase II that lacks the C-terminal domain to accurately transcribe specific genes. When calf thymus RNA polymerase II that lacked the C-terminal domain was added back to the inhibited extract, a discrete transcript that was initiated correctly was obtained with the adenovirus-2 major late promoter; however, no discrete transcript was observed from the mouse dhfr gene promoter. When injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, antibody 3WG2 inhibited transcription of the human histone H2b gene (contains a TATA box) and the human U1 small nuclear RNA gene (does not contain a TATA box), but did not inhibit transcription from RNA polymerase I or RNA polymerase III promoters. These results indicate that the C-terminal heptapeptide repeat plays a critical role in promoter-directed transcription, although enzyme that lacks this domain can initiate from some promoters in vitro."

Comparisons with other known germins and germin-like proteins indicate that these Arabidopsis GLP subfamilies are unique from wheat germin. All other known GLPs fall into one of these subfamilies. The translated GLPs show approximately 35% amino acid identity with other GLPs outside of their subfamily and significantly higher levels of identity within their respective subfamily. The 3' ends of many of the GLP cDNAs are heterogeneous and several sites of polyadenylation are used. Ten of the GLPs have N-terminal signal sequences and most appear to be exported from the cell. Structurally, the GLPs are predicted to have a high content of beta-pleated sheet. Seven conserved regions of beta-sheet were found in each of the GLP proteins along with alpha-helices located at both N- and C-termini. These same structural elements are also conserved in wheat germin. With one exception, all GLP family members contain at least one N-glycosylation site. All of these sites are conserved in an unstructured loop between beta-1 and beta-2. Genes for two of these GLPs were identified in genomic sequences previously deposited in the GenBank. The GLP3b gene is physically linked to the polyubiquitin 4 gene. The 3' end of the GLP3b mRNA is only 0.5 kb from the ubq4 start of transcription. Analysis of the GLP3b promoter shows the presence of a single putative auxin-response sequence located at -124 to -111 upstream from the 5' end of the GLP3b mRNA. The GLP9 gene was identified in an Arabidopsis contig from Chromosome 4."
"9807827","articletitle","An endosperm-specific DOF protein from barley, highly conserved in wheat, binds to and activates transcription from the prolamin-box of a native B-hordein promoter in barley endosperm."
"9807827","abstracttext","A cDNA encoding a DNA-binding protein of the DOF class of transcription factors was isolated from a barley endosperm library. The deduced amino acid sequence for the corresponding protein is 94% identical through the DOF domain to the prolamin-box (P-box) binding factor PBF from maize. The gene encoding the barley PBF (BPBF) maps to chromosome 7H, and its expression is restricted to the endosperm where it precedes that of the hordein genes. The BPBF expressed in bacteria as a GST-fusion binds a P-box 5'-TGTAAAG-3' containing oligonucleotide derived from the promoter region of an Hor2 gene. Binding was prevented when the P-box motif was mutated to 5'-TGTAgAc-3'. A P-box binding activity, present in barley and wheat endosperm nuclei, interacted similarly to BPBF with this synthetic oligonucleotide, and the binding was abolished by 1,10-phenanthroline. Transient expression experiments in developing barley endosperms demonstrate that BPBF transactivates transcription from the P-box element of a native Hor2 promoter and that direct binding of BPBF to its target site is essential for transactivation since mutations in the DOF DNA-binding domain or in the P-box motif of this promoter abolished both binding and transactivation. Evidence was also obtained for the presence in wheat of a Pbf homologue having similar DNA-binding properties to that of BPBF. These results strongly implicate this endosperm-specific DOF protein from barley as an important activator of hordein gene expression and suggest the evolutionary conservation of the Pbf gene function among small grain cereals."

"15592809","abstracttext","A new source of greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) resistance derived from Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmal was identified in W7984, a synthetic hexaploid wheat line and one parent of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) mapping population. Segregation analysis of responses to greenbug feeding in a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) identified a single, dominant gene governing the greenbug resistance in W7984, which was placed in chromosome arm 7DL by linkage analysis with molecular markers in the ITMI population. Allelism tests based on the segregation of responses to greenbug feeding in F2 and testcross plants revealed that the greenbug resistance in W7984 and Largo, another synthetic line carrying the greenbug resistance gene Gb3, was controlled by different but linked loci. Using the ITMI reference map and a target mapping strategy, we have constructed a microsatellite map of Gb3 in a mapping population of 130 F7 RILs from Largo x TAM 107 and identified one marker (Xwmc634) co-segregating with Gb3 and four markers (Xbarc76, Xgwm037, Xgwm428 and Xwmc824) closely linked with Gb3. Deletion mapping of selected microsatellite markers flanking the Gb3 locus placed this resistance gene into the distal 18% region of 7DL. Comparative mapping in the ITMI and Largo x TAM 107 populations using the same set of microsatellite markers provided further evidence that greenbug resistance in W7984 and Largo is conditioned by two different loci. We suggest that the greenbug resistance gene in W7984 be designated Gb7. The microsatellite map of Gb3 constructed from this study should be a valuable tool for marker-assisted selection of Gb3-conferred greenbug resistance in wheat breeding."
"15711972","articletitle","Fate of mitochondrially located S19 ribosomal protein genes after transfer of a functional copy to the nucleus in cereals."
"15711972","abstracttext","Mitochondrial genes for ribosomal proteins undergo relatively frequent transfer to the nucleus during plant evolution, and when migration is successful the mitochondrial copy becomes redundant and can be lost. We have examined the status of the mitochondrial rps19 gene for ribosomal protein S19 in closely related cereals. In oat, the mitochondrial rps19 reading frame is blocked by a premature termination codon and lacks abundant transcripts, whereas in the mitochondria of wheat and rye rps19 is a 5'-truncated pseudogene which is co-transcribed with the downstream nad4L gene. In barley and maize, rps19 sequences are completely absent from the mitochondrion. All five of these cereals differ from rice, in which an intact, transcriptionally active mitochondrial rps19 gene is found, and this is preceded by rpl2 in an organization reminiscent of that seen in bacteria. Based on EST sequence data for maize, barley and wheat, it can be inferred that a functional rps19 gene was transferred to the nucleus prior to the divergence of the maize and rice lineages (approximately 50 million years ago), and the present-day nuclear copies encode an N-terminal sequence related to the mitochondrial targeting signal of Hsp70 (heat shock protein) in cereals. Subsequent evolutionary events have included independent losses of the mitochondrial copies in the barley and maize lineages. In the rice lineage, on the other hand, the nuclear copy was lost. This is reflected in the persistence of the mitochondrial rps19 after a period during which rps19 genes coexisted in both compartments. These observations illustrate the dynamic nature of the location and structure of genes for mitochondrial ribosomal proteins in flowering plants."

"15803289","abstracttext","This study was conducted to genetically map a potentially new wheat leaf rust resistance gene (LrW) using a novel genetic method and to test its effectiveness against current races of leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks.) in Canada. Undoubled haploids of a near-isogenic line of Thatcher carrying the resistance gene (RL6107) were pollinated with a contrasting susceptible cultivar to generate an array of hybrids with random deficiencies arising from irregular meiosis of the haploid. Genetic analysis of the deficiencies in such populations can be used to locate qualitative traits by which the two parents differ through a process that we have called haploid deficiency mapping. In the present case, 5/417 hybrids were both susceptible to leaf rust (i.e. lacked the resistance gene) and also lacked several polymorphic microsatellite alleles from RL6107 that are specific to chromosome 5B. This correlated failed transmission of the resistance gene and deficiency for chromosome 5B. Analysis of an F2 population showed that the factor conditioning resistance was located on the short arm of 5B, 16.5 cM distal to the locus of the microsatellite Xgwm443. Since no other leaf rust resistance genes have been mapped to this region, LrW was re-designated Lr52. RL6107 was tested with 29 isolates of P. triticina, encompassing a diversity of virulence found in North America, with none showing virulence. The effectiveness and novelty of Lr52 make it a promising source of resistance for North American wheat cultivars."

"15082925","abstracttext","Forty-eight resistance (R) genes conferring resistance to various types of pests have been cloned from 12 plant species. Irrespective of the host or the pest type, most R genes share a strong protein sequence similarity especially for domains and motifs. The objective of this study was to identify expressed R genes of wheat, the fraction of which is expected to be very low in the genome. Using modified RNA fingerprinting and data mining approaches we identified 220 expressed R-gene candidates. Of these, 125 sequences structurally resembled known R genes. In addition to 25-87% protein sequence similarity with the known R genes, the sequence, order, and distribution of the domains and motifs were also the same. Among the remaining 95, 17 were probable R-related, 21 were a new class of nucleotide-binding kinases, 21 were probable kinases, and 36 were p-loop-containing unknown sequences. About 76% were rare including 73 novel sequences. Three new R-gene specific motifs were also identified. Physical mapping of the 164 best R-gene candidates on 339 deletion lines localized 121 mappable R-gene candidates to 26 small chromosomal regions encompassing about 16% of the genome. About 90 of the 110 phenotypically characterized wheat R genes corresponding to 18 different pests also mapped in these regions."

"20335409","abstracttext","Stable RNA interference-based technology was used to silence the expression of the HvCKX1 gene in barley and the TaCKX1 gene in wheat and triticale. The silencing cassettes containing the fragments of these genes in the sense and antisense orientations were cloned into the pMCG161 binary vector and used for Agrobacterium-based transformation. Out of the five cultivars representing the three studied species, transgenic plants were obtained from one barley cultivar Golden Promise, one wheat cultivar Kontesa, and one triticale cultivar Wanad. Almost 80% of 52 regenerated lines of Golden Promise exhibited significantly decreased cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase (CKX) enzyme activity in bulked samples of their T(1) roots. There was a positive correlation between the enzyme activity and the plant productivity, expressed as the yield, the number of seeds per plant, and the 1000 grain weight. Additionally, these traits were associated with a greater root mass. Lower CKX activity led to a higher plant yield and root weight. This higher plant productivity and altered plant architecture were maintained in a population of segregating T(1) plants. The levels of HvCKX1 transcript accumulation were measured in various tissues of Golden Promise and Scarlett non-transgenic barley plants in order to choose the most appropriate plant organs to study the expression and/or silencing of the gene in those transgenic lines. The highest levels of the HvCKX1 transcript were detected in spikes 0 days after pollination (0 DAP), 7 DAP, and 14 DAP, and in the seedling roots. The analysis of HvCKX1 gene expression and CKX enzyme activity and the evaluation of the phenotype were performed in the progeny of seven selected transgenic T(1) lines. The relative expression of HvCKX1 measured in the spikes 0 DAP and 14 DAP, respectively, ranged from 0.52+/-0.04 to 1.15+/-0.26 and from 0.47+/-0.07 to 0.89+/-0.15. The lowest relative values were obtained for the enzyme activity in the spikes at 0 DAP, which ranged from 0.15+/-0.02 to 1.05+/-0.14 per single progeny plant. Based on these three values, the coefficient of HvCKX1 silencing in the spikes was estimated. Possible mechanisms leading to higher plant productivity via the silencing of HvCKX1 and a decrease in CKX enzyme activity are discussed."
"20401645","articletitle","Identification of quantitative trait loci for ABA responsiveness at the seedling stage associated with ABA-regulated gene expression in common wheat."
"20401645","abstracttext","Responsiveness to abscisic acid (ABA) during vegetative growth plays an important role in regulating adaptive responses to various environmental conditions, including activation of a number of ABA-responsive genes. However, the relationship between gene expression and responsiveness to ABA at the seedling stage has not been well studied in wheat. In the present study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for ABA responsiveness at the seedling stage was performed using recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between common wheat cultivars showing different ABA responsiveness. Five QTLs were found to be significant, located on chromosomes 1B, 2A, 3A, 6D and 7B. The QTL with the greatest effect was located on chromosome 6D and explained 11.12% of the variance in ABA responsiveness. The other QTLs each accounted for approximately 5-8% of the phenotypic variation. Expression analyses of three ABA-responsive Cor/Lea genes, Wdhn13, Wrab15 and Wrab17, showed that allelic differences in QTLs on chromosomes 2A, 6D and 7B influenced expression of these genes in seedlings treated with ABA. The 3A QTL appeared to be involved in the regulatory system of Wdhn13 and Wrab15, but not Wrab17. The effects of the 2A and 6D QTLs on gene expression were relatively large. The combination of alleles at the QTLs resulted in an additive or synergistic effect on Cor/Lea expression. These results indicate that the QTLs influencing ABA responsiveness are associated with ABA-regulated gene expression and suggest that the QTL on chromosome 6D with the largest effect acts as a key regulator of ABA responses including seedling growth arrest and gene expression during the vegetative stage."
"19727653","articletitle","Amplification of prolamin storage protein genes in different subfamilies of the Poaceae."
"19727653","abstracttext","Prolamins are seed storage proteins in cereals and represent an important source of essential amino acids for feed and food. Genes encoding these proteins resulted from dispersed and tandem amplification. While previous studies have concentrated on protein sequences from different grass species, we now can add a new perspective to their relationships by asking how their genes are shared by ancestry and copied in different lineages of the same family of species. These differences are derived from alignment of chromosomal regions, where collinearity is used to identify prolamin genes in syntenic positions, also called orthologous gene copies. New or paralogous gene copies are inserted in tandem or new locations of the same genome. More importantly, one can detect the loss of older genes. We analyzed chromosomal intervals containing prolamin genes from rice, sorghum, wheat, barley, and Brachypodium, representing different subfamilies of the Poaceae. The Poaceae commonly known as the grasses includes three major subfamilies, the Ehrhartoideae (rice), Pooideae (wheat, barley, and Brachypodium), and Panicoideae (millets, maize, sorghum, and switchgrass). Based on chromosomal position and sequence divergence, it becomes possible to infer the order of gene amplification events. Furthermore, the loss of older genes in different subfamilies seems to permit a faster pace of divergence of paralogous genes. Change in protein structure affects their physical properties, subcellular location, and amino acid composition. On the other hand, regulatory sequence elements and corresponding transcriptional activators of new gene copies are more conserved than coding sequences, consistent with the tissue-specific expression of these genes."

We used Illumina sequencing to rapidly access the genomic sequence of the highly virulent PST race 130 (PST-130)."

Although the automatic gene prediction has limitations, we show that a comparative genomics approach using multiple rust species can greatly improve the quality of gene annotation in these species. The PST-130 sequence will also be useful for comparative studies within PST as more races are sequenced. This study illustrates the power of NGS for rapid and efficient access to genomic sequence in non-model organisms."
"20713469","articletitle","Contrasting evolutionary patterns of the Rp1 resistance gene family in different species of Poaceae."
"20713469","abstracttext","Disease-resistance genes (R-genes) in plants show complex evolutionary patterns. We investigated the evolution of the Rp1 R-gene family in Poaceae, and 409 Rp1 fragments were sequenced from 21 species. Our data showed that the common ancestor of Poaceae had two Rp1 loci, but the number of Rp1 locus in extant species varies from one to five. Some wheat and Zea genotypes have dozens of Rp1 homologues in striking contrast to one or two copies in Brachypodium distachyon. The large number of diverse Rp1 homologues in Zea was the result of duplications followed by extensive sequence exchanges among paralogues, and all genes in maize have evolved in a pattern of Type I R-genes. The high frequency of sequence exchanges did not cause concerted evolution in Zea species, but concerted evolution was obvious between Rp1 homologues from genera Zea and Sorghum. Differentiation of Type I and Type II Rp1 homologues was observed in Oryza species, likely occurred in their common ancestor. One member (Type II R-gene) in the Oryza Rp1 cluster did not change sequences with its paralogues, whereas the other paralogues (Type I R-genes) had frequent sequence exchanges. The functional Pi37 resistance gene in rice was generated through an unequal crossover between two neighboring paralogues followed by four point mutations. The Rp1 homologues in wheat and barley were most divergent, probably due to lack of sequence exchanges among them. Our results shed more light on R-gene evolution, particularly on the differentiation of Type I and Type II R-genes."

"22772588","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat in areas with cool and maritime climates. Chinese wheat landrace Baihulu confers a high level of resistance against a wide range of Blumeria graminis DC f. sp. tritici (Bgt) races, especially those currently prevailing in Shaanxi. The objectives of this study were to determine the chromosome bin location of the mlbhl gene from Baihulu and its allelism with Pm24. To investigate the inheritance of powdery mildew resistance and detect adjacent molecular markers, we constructed a segregating population of 301 F(2) plants and corresponding F(2:3) families derived from Baihulu/Shaanyou 225. Genetic analysis revealed that a single dominant gene was responsible for seedling stage powdery mildew resistance in Baihulu. A genetic map comprising Xgwm106, Xgwm337, Xgwm1675, Xgwm603, Xgwm789, Xbarc229, Xgpw4503, Xcfd72, Xcfd83, Xcfd59, Xcfd19, and mlbhl spanned 28.2 cM on chromosome 1D. Xgwm603/Xgwm789 and Xbarc229 were flanking markers tightly linked to mlbhl at genetic distances of 1.5 and 1.0 cM, respectively. The mlbhl locus was located in chromosome bin 1DS 0.59-1.00 delimited by the SSR markers Xgwm337 and Xbarc229. When tested with a differential array of 23 Bgt isolates Baihulu displayed a response pattern that was clearly distinguishable from that of Chiyacao and varieties or lines possessing documented Pm genes.

"23413756","abstracttext","Genes coding for avenin-like proteins (ALP) represent a new family of wheat storage protein genes. To find a wheat endosperm-specific promoter, a 1644-bp fragment upstream of the ALP type-B gene (GenBank accession number JN622144) was isolated. The important promoter elements of the ALP type-B gene were ascertained through sequence analysis which revealed that this fragment contains the TATA and CAAT boxes, which are important elements in gene expression. A prolamin box containing an endosperm motif and a GCN4-like motif (GLM) is present at about 300 bp upstream of the translation start site. The promoter sequence has two ESP-like elements and one of them is followed by an RY motif with the nucleotides CATG overlapping. The RY motif is considered the core functional sequence in a promoter. In an attempt to confirm the promoter activity, a series of 5'-deletions of the promoter were fused with the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene, and the constructs were stably introduced into tobacco plants. GUS staining confirmed that the AVL type-B promoter is an endosperm-specific promoter in tobacco seeds. Quantitative analysis of GUS expression in transgenic plants showed that even the shortest 5'-deletion, i.e. a 290-bp promoter sequence within the prolamin box, was sufficient to drive GUS expression in the endosperm. The highest expression level was found in transgenic plants containing the 5'-deletion vector construct pALP-8. This suggests that the ESP-like element overlapping with the RY motif may play a crucial role in the regulatory function of the promoter."

"23873997","abstracttext","Heading time is a major determinant of the adaptation of wheat to different environments, and is critical in minimizing risks of frost, heat, and drought on reproductive development. Given that major developmental genes are known in wheat, a process-based model, APSIM, was modified to incorporate gene effects into estimation of heading time, while minimizing degradation in the predictive capability of the model. Model parameters describing environment responses were replaced with functions of the number of winter and photoperiod (PPD)-sensitive alleles at the three VRN1 loci and the Ppd-D1 locus, respectively. Two years of vernalization and PPD trials of 210 lines (spring wheats) at a single location were used to estimate the effects of the VRN1 and Ppd-D1 alleles, with validation against 190 trials (~4400 observations) across the Australian wheatbelt. Compared with spring genotypes, winter genotypes for Vrn-A1 (i.e. with two winter alleles) had a delay of 76.8 degree days (°Cd) in time to heading, which was double the effect of the Vrn-B1 or Vrn-D1 winter genotypes. Of the three VRN1 loci, winter alleles at Vrn-B1 had the strongest interaction with PPD, delaying heading time by 99.0 °Cd under long days. The gene-based model had root mean square error of 3.2 and 4.3 d for calibration and validation datasets, respectively. Virtual genotypes were created to examine heading time in comparison with frost and heat events and showed that new longer-season varieties could be heading later (with potential increased yield) when sown early in season. This gene-based model allows breeders to consider how to target gene combinations to current and future production environments using parameters determined from a small set of phenotyping treatments."
"24629124","articletitle","An asparagine residue at the N-terminus affects the maturation process of low molecular weight glutenin subunits of wheat endosperm."
"24629124","abstracttext_background","Wheat glutenin polymers are made up of two main subunit types, the high- (HMW-GS) and low- (LMW-GS) molecular weight subunits. These latter are represented by heterogeneous proteins. The most common, based on the first amino acid of the mature sequence, are known as LMW-m and LMW-s types. The mature sequences differ as a consequence of three extra amino acids (MET-) at the N-terminus of LMW-m types. The nucleotide sequences of their encoding genes are, however, nearly identical, so that the relationship between gene and protein sequences is difficult to ascertain.It has been hypothesized that the presence of an asparagine residue in position 23 of the complete coding sequence for the LMW-s type might account for the observed three-residue shortened sequence, as a consequence of cleavage at the asparagine by an asparaginyl endopeptidase."
"24629124","abstracttext_results","We performed site-directed mutagenesis of a LMW-s gene to replace asparagine at position 23 with threonine and thus convert it to a candidate LMW-m type gene. Similarly, a candidate LMW-m type gene was mutated at position 23 to replace threonine with asparagine. Next, we produced transgenic durum wheat (cultivar Svevo) lines by introducing the mutated versions of the LMW-m and LMW-s genes, along with the wild type counterpart of the LMW-m gene.Proteomic comparisons between the transgenic and null segregant plants enabled identification of transgenic proteins by mass spectrometry analyses and Edman N-terminal sequencing."
"24629124","abstracttext_conclusions","Our results show that the formation of LMW-s type relies on the presence of an asparagine residue close to the N-terminus generated by signal peptide cleavage, and that LMW-GS can be quantitatively processed most likely by vacuolar asparaginyl endoproteases, suggesting that those accumulated in the vacuole are not sequestered into stable aggregates that would hinder the action of proteolytic enzymes. Rather, whatever is the mechanism of glutenin polymer transport to the vacuole, the proteins remain available for proteolytic processing, and can be converted to the mature form by the removal of a short N-terminal sequence."

The aim of this study was to characterize seedling and adult plant leaf rust resistance of a world wheat collection. Using controlled inoculation with ten races of Puccinia triticina , 14 seedling resistance genes were determined or postulated to be present in the collection. Lr1 , Lr3 , Lr10 and Lr20 were the most prevalent genes around the world while Lr9 , Lr14b , Lr3ka and/or Lr30 and Lr26 were rare. To confirm some gene postulations, the collection was screened with gene-specific molecular markers for Lr1 , Lr10 , Lr21 and Lr34 . Although possessing the Lr1 and/or Lr10 gene-specific marker, 51 accessions showed unexpected high infection types to P. triticina race BBBD. The collection was tested in the field, where rust resistance ranged from nearly immune or highly resistant with severity of 1 % and resistant host response to highly susceptible with severity of 84 % and susceptible host response. The majority of the accessions possessing the adult plant resistance (APR) gene Lr34 had a maximum rust severity of 0-35 %, similar to or better than accession RL6058, a Thatcher- Lr34 near-isogenic line. Many accessions displayed an immune response or a high level of resistance under field conditions, likely as a result of synergy between APR genes or between APR and seedling resistance genes. However, accessions with three or more seedling resistance genes had an overall lower field severity than those with two or fewer. Immune or highly resistant accessions are potential sources for improvement of leaf rust resistance. In addition, some lines were postulated to have known but unidentified genes/alleles or novel genes, also constituting potentially important sources of novel resistance."

Host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) has emerged a useful tool to examine the importance of rust fungus genes while growing within host plants.

Most of the genes tested had no noticeable effects, but 10 reduced Pgt development after co-inoculation with the gene VIGS constructs and Pgt.

"25871858","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Resistance is the best way to control the disease. YrSP, a gene originally from 'Spaldings Prolific' wheat and providing resistance to a broad spectrum of races, is used for differentiating P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races but its chromosomal location is not clear. To map YrSP, a near-isogenic line (AvSYrSPNIL) was backcrossed to the recurrent parent, Avocet S. Genetic analysis of the BC7F1, BC8, BC7F2, and BC7F3 progenies confirmed a single dominant gene for resistance. In total, 182 BC7F2 plants and their derived BC7F3 lines were phenotyped with an avirulent P. striiformis f. sp. tritici race and genotyped with simple-sequence repeat (SSR), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. A linkage map was constructed with 3 SSR, 17 SNP, and 3 STS markers covering 23.3 centimorgans (cM). Markers IWA638 and dp269 were 0.6 cM proximal and 1.5 cM distal, respectively, to YrSP. The gene was mapped in chromosome bin 2BL-C-0.5, physically within the proximal 50% of the chromosome 2BL arm. Allelism tests based on F2 phenotypes indicated that YrSP is closely linked to but not allelic with genes Yr5, Yr7, Yr43, Yr44, and Yr53. Infection type data from tests with 10 historical and currently predominant P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races in the United States also demonstrated differences in specificity between YrSP and the other genes. The specificity of YrSP is useful in differentiating P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races and studying the plant-pathogen interactions, and the information of chromosomal location of the gene and its tightly linked markers should be useful in developing resistant cultivars when combined with other genes for resistance to stripe rust."

"26433828","abstracttext_key message","Complementary genes for resistance to wheat stripe rust in an Avocet selection mapped to chromosome arms 3DL and 5BL. Susceptible Avocet selections lacked the 5BL gene due to a chromosomal deletion. This study reports the inheritance and genetic mapping of the YrA (temporary name of convenience to describe the specificity) seedling resistance to wheat stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici; Pst) in a resistant selection of the Australian cv. Avocet [Avocet R (AvR)-AUS 90660]. Genetic analysis was performed on F2 populations and F3 generation families from crosses between wheats that carried and lacked the YrA resistance. Greenhouse seedling tests with two avirulent Pst pathotypes (104 E137 A- and 108 E141 A-) confirmed that the YrA resistance was inherited as two complementary dominant genes. Ninety-two doubled haploid (DH) lines from a cross between the Australian cv. Teal (Pst susceptible) and AvR were used for DArT-Seq genotypic analysis to map the seedling resistance. Marker-trait association analysis using 9035 DArT-Seq loci mapped the genes to the long arms of chromosomes 3D (3DL) and 5B (5BL), respectively. F2 populations from crosses between susceptible DH lines that carried either the 3DL or 5BL marker genotypes confirmed the complementary gene model. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis determined that Teal carries a reciprocal T5B-7B translocation. FISH analysis also identified a 5BL chromosomal deletion in Avocet S relative to AvR that further validated the complementary gene model and possibly explained the heterogeneity of closely related wheats carrying the YrA resistance. The individual loci of the complementary YrA resistance were designated Yr73 (3DL) and Yr74 (5BL). Candidate single gene reference stocks will be permanently accessioned following cytological analysis to avoid the T5B-7B translocation."

"27174222","abstracttext_key message","Fine mapping and sequencing revealed 28 genes in the non-recombining haplotype containing Fhb1 . Of these, only a GDSL lipase gene shows a pathogen-dependent expression pattern. Fhb1 is a prominent Fusarium head blight resistance locus of wheat, which has been successfully introgressed in adapted breeding material, where it confers a significant increase in overall resistance to the causal pathogen Fusarium graminearum and the fungal virulence factor and mycotoxin deoxynivalenol. The Fhb1 region has been resolved for the susceptible wheat reference genotype Chinese Spring, yet the causal gene itself has not been identified in resistant cultivars. Here, we report the establishment of a 1 Mb contig embracing Fhb1 in the donor line CM-82036. Sequencing revealed that the region of Fhb1 deviates from the Chinese Spring reference in DNA size and gene content, which explains the repressed recombination at the locus in the performed fine mapping. Differences in genes expression between near-isogenic lines segregating for Fhb1 challenged with F. graminearum or treated with mock were investigated in a time-course experiment by RNA sequencing. Several candidate genes were identified, including a pathogen-responsive GDSL lipase absent in susceptible lines. The sequence of the Fhb1 region, the resulting list of candidate genes, and near-diagnostic KASP markers for Fhb1 constitute a valuable resource for breeding and further studies aiming to identify the gene(s) responsible for F. graminearum and deoxynivalenol resistance."

"26941766","abstracttext","The recent resurgence of wheat stem rust caused by new virulent races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt) poses a threat to food security. These concerns have catalyzed an extensive global effort toward controlling this disease. Substantial research and breeding programs target the identification and introduction of new stem rust resistance (Sr) genes in cultivars for genetic protection against the disease. Such resistance genes typically encode immune receptor proteins that recognize specific components of the pathogen, known as avirulence (Avr) proteins. A significant drawback to deploying cultivars with single Sr genes is that they are often overcome by evolution of the pathogen to escape recognition through alterations in Avr genes. Thus, a key element in achieving durable rust control is the deployment of multiple effective Sr genes in combination, either through conventional breeding or transgenic approaches, to minimize the risk of resistance breakdown. In this situation, evolution of pathogen virulence would require changes in multiple Avr genes in order to bypass recognition. However, choosing the optimal Sr gene combinations to deploy is a challenge that requires detailed knowledge of the pathogen Avr genes with which they interact and the virulence phenotypes of Pgt existing in nature. Identifying specific Avr genes from Pgt will provide screening tools to enhance pathogen virulence monitoring, assess heterozygosity and propensity for mutation in pathogen populations, and confirm individual Sr gene functions in crop varieties carrying multiple effective resistance genes. Toward this goal, much progress has been made in assembling a high quality reference genome sequence for Pgt, as well as a Pan-genome encompassing variation between multiple field isolates with diverse virulence spectra. In turn this has allowed prediction of Pgt effector gene candidates based on known features of Avr genes in other plant pathogens, including the related flax rust fungus. Upregulation of gene expression in haustoria and evidence for diversifying selection are two useful parameters to identify candidate Avr genes. Recently, we have also applied machine learning approaches to agnostically predict candidate effectors. Here, we review progress in stem rust pathogenomics and approaches currently underway to identify Avr genes recognized by wheat Sr genes."

"27507961","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is an opportunistic pathogen of cereals where it causes severe yield losses and concomitant mycotoxin contamination of the grains. The pathogen has mixed biotrophic and necrotrophic (saprophytic) growth phases during infection and the regulatory networks associated with these phases have so far always been analyzed together. In this study we compared the transcriptomes of fungal cells infecting a living, actively defending plant representing the mixed live style (pathogenic growth on living flowering wheat heads) to the response of the fungus infecting identical, but dead plant tissues (cold-killed flowering wheat heads) representing strictly saprophytic conditions. We found that the living plant actively suppressed fungal growth and promoted much higher toxin production in comparison to the identical plant tissue without metabolism suggesting that molecules signaling secondary metabolite induction are not pre-existing or not stable in the plant in sufficient amounts before infection. Differential gene expression analysis was used to define gene sets responding to the active or the passive plant as main impact factor and driver for gene expression. We correlated our results to the published F. graminearum transcriptomes, proteomes, and secretomes and found that only a limited number of in planta- expressed genes require the living plant for induction but the majority uses simply the plant tissue as signal. Many secondary metabolite (SM) gene clusters show a heterogeneous expression pattern within the cluster indicating that different genetic or epigenetic signals govern the expression of individual genes within a physically linked cluster. Our bioinformatic approach also identified fungal genes which were actively repressed by signals derived from the active plant and may thus represent direct targets of the plant defense against the invading pathogen."

"28303143","abstracttext","Severe infestations of Alopecurus aequalis (shortawn foxtail), a noxious weed in wheat and barley cropping systems in Japan, can occur even after application of thifensulfuron-methyl, a sulfonylurea (SU) herbicide. In the present study, nine accessions of A. aequalis growing in a single wheat field were tested for sensitivity to thifensulfuron-methyl. Seven of the nine accessions survived application of standard field rates of thifensulfuron-methyl, indicating that severe infestations likely result from herbicide resistance. Acetolactate synthase (ALS) is the target enzyme of SU herbicides. Full-length genes encoding ALS were therefore isolated to determine the mechanism of SU resistance. As a result, differences in ALS gene copy numbers among accessions were revealed. Two copies, ALS1 and ALS2 , were conserved in all accessions, while some carried two additional copies, ALS3 and ALS4 . A single-base deletion in ALS3 and ALS4 further indicated that they represent pseudogenes. No differences in ploidy level were observed between accessions with two or four copies of the ALS gene, suggesting that copy number varies. Resistant plants were found to carry a mutation in either the ALS1 or ALS2 gene, with all mutations causing an amino acid substitution at the Pro197 residue, which is known to confer SU resistance. Transcription of each ALS gene copy was confirmed by reverse transcription PCR, supporting involvement of these mutations in SU resistance. The information on the copy number and full-length sequences of ALS genes in A. aequalis will aid future analysis of the mechanism of resistance."

"30769527","abstracttext","The CIMMYT-developed spring wheat 'Brambling' has a high level of adult-plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina. Our objectives were to determine the genetic basis of resistance in seedlings and adult plants and the magnitude of genotype × environment effects on the expression of APR. Brambling was crossed with spring wheat 'Jupateco 73S' that is highly susceptible to current predominant P. triticina races in Mexico and the United States. The F 1 , F 2:3 , F 4:5 , F 4:6 , and F 5:7 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were evaluated under artificial field epidemics in Mexico and St. Paul, MN. The RILs also were tested with five races of P. triticina in greenhouse seedling experiments. A DNA marker was used to postulate the presence of slow-rusting gene Lr34 in the RILs. F 1 data suggested strong dominant effect of the APR genes in Brambling. The proportion of homozygous susceptible lines in each generation indicated the presence of three effective resistance genes in adult plants of Brambling in tests in Mexico and three or four genes in tests in St. Paul. The RILs segregated for seedling genes Lr14a and Lr23 and adult-plant slow-rusting gene Lr34 derived from Brambling and Lr17a from Jupateco 73S. Gene Lr23 conditioned APR to P. triticina races present in the St. Paul nursery and accounted for the additional effective gene at this location. Expression of APR was influenced by the environment in the RILs, even though Brambling displayed a consistent response, indicating that stability of APR can be achieved by combinations of slow-rusting resistance genes."

Powdery mildew is a globally important wheat disease causing severe yield losses, and host resistance is the preferred strategy for managing this disease. The objective of this study was to characterize a powdery mildew resistance gene in Iranian landrace PI 628024, which exhibited a wide spectrum of resistance to representative Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolates collected from different regions of the USA. An F 2 population and F 2:3 lines derived from the cross PI 628024 × CItr 11349 were used in this study, and genetic analysis indicated that a single dominant gene, designated Pm63, conferred resistance to Bgt isolate OKS(14)-B-3-1. Linkage analysis located Pm63 to an interval of about 13.1 Mb on the long arm of chromosome 2B, spanning 710.3-723.4 Mb in the Chinese Spring reference sequence. Bin mapping assigned Pm63 to the terminal bin 2BL6-0.89-1.0, 1.1 cM proximal to STS marker Xbcd135-2 and 0.6 cM distal to SSR marker Xstars419. Allelism tests indicated that Pm63 is a new powdery mildew resistance gene, which differs from other genes in the terminal bin by origin, genomic location, and responses to a set of 16 representative US Bgt isolates. Pm63 can be widely used to enhance powdery mildew resistance in the Great Plains, western, and southeastern regions of the USA."

"30921457","abstracttext","In spite of the increasing expectation for process-based crop modelling to capture genotype (G) by environment (E) by management (M) interactions to support breeding selections, it remains a challenge to use current crop models to accurately predict phenotypes from genotypes or from candidate genes. We use wheat as a target crop and the APSIM farming systems model (Holzworth et al., 2014) as an example to analyse the current status of process-based crop models with a major focus on need to improve simulation of specific eco-physiological processes and their linkage to underlying genetic controls. For challenging production environments in Australia, we examine the potential opportunities to capture physiological traits, and to integrate genetic and molecular approaches for future model development and applications. Model improvement will require both reducing the uncertainty in simulating key physiological processes and enhancing the capture of key observable traits and underlying genetic control of key physiological responses to environment. An approach consisting of three interactive stages is outlined to (i) improve modelling of crop physiology, (ii) develop linkage from model parameter to genotypes and further to loci or alleles, and (iii) further link to gene expression pathways. This helps to facilitate the integration of modelling, phenotyping, and functional gene detection and to effectively advance modelling of G×E×M interactions. While gene-based modelling is not always needed to simulate G×E×M, including well-understood gene effects can improve the estimation of genotype effects and prediction of phenotypes. Specific examples are given for enhanced modelling of wheat in the APSIM framework."

"32046716","abstracttext_background","The gene content of a species largely governs its ecological interactions and adaptive potential. A species is therefore defined by both core genes shared between all individuals and accessory genes segregating presence-absence variation. There is growing evidence that eukaryotes, similar to bacteria, show intra-specific variability in gene content. However, it remains largely unknown how functionally relevant such a pangenome structure is for eukaryotes and what mechanisms underlie the emergence of highly polymorphic genome structures."
"32046716","abstracttext_results","Here, we establish a reference-quality pangenome of a fungal pathogen of wheat based on 19 complete genomes from isolates sampled across six continents. Zymoseptoria tritici causes substantial worldwide losses to wheat production due to rapidly evolved tolerance to fungicides and evasion of host resistance. We performed transcriptome-assisted annotations of each genome to construct a global pangenome. Major chromosomal rearrangements are segregating within the species and underlie extensive gene presence-absence variation. Conserved orthogroups account for only ~ 60% of the species pangenome. Investigating gene functions, we find that the accessory genome is enriched for pathogenesis-related functions and encodes genes involved in metabolite production, host tissue degradation and manipulation of the immune system. De novo transposon annotation of the 19 complete genomes shows that the highly diverse chromosomal structure is tightly associated with transposable element content. Furthermore, transposable element expansions likely underlie recent genome expansions within the species."

"30665058","abstracttext","Salt stress suppresses plant growth, development, and crop productivity. In this study, we characterized the role of TaZFP1, a C2H2 type-zinc finger protein family member of T. aestivum, in salt stress tolerance. TaZFP1 possesses a conserved C2H2 motif (CX 2-4 CX 12 HX 3-5 H) shared by plant ZFP proteins, translocates to the nucleus after endoplasmic reticulum (ER) assortment, and displays a ZF 3-D structure similar to its eukaryote homologs. The transcripts of TaZFP1 were upregulated during salt stress condition and this effect was restored under normal conditions. Compared to wild type (WT), the transgenic lines of TaZFP1 overexpression or knockdown displayed improved phenotypes, biomass, photosynthesis parameters (Pn, ΨPSII, and NPQ), osmolytes contents (i.e. proline and soluble sugar), and enhanced antioxidant enzyme (AE) activity following salt stress treatment. A set of genes associated with proline synthesis (i.e., NtP5CS1 and NtP5CS2) and encoding AEs (i.e., NtSOD2, NtCAT1, and NtPOD4) were upregulated in the salt-challenged transgenic lines of TaZFP1 expression. Additionally, the transgenic lines exhibited similar stomata movement patterns and leaf water retention properties under salinity conditions compared to those induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, suggesting that the TaZFP1-mediated salt response is dependent on the ABA signaling. High throughput RNAseq analysis revealed significant alteration of gene transcription in transgenic lines upon salt stress. Among them, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) represented by the gene ontology (GO) terms were associated with organic acid, carboxylic acid, carbohydrate, and coenzyme as well as organonitrogen compounds, translation, peptide metabolism, and peptide biosynthesis. A set of upregulated DEGs were found to be thylakoid- and photosystem-associated, which is consistent with the TaZFP1-mediated improvement in photosynthesis in salt-stressed transgenic lines. Our investigation indicated that the TaZFP1-mediated salt tolerance is ascribed to the regulation of gene functions related to photosynthesis, osmolytes metabolism and ROS homeostasis mediated by ABA signaling."

"21308422","abstracttext","We have analyzed factors affecting the codon usage pattern of the chloroplasts genomes of representative species of pooid grass family. Correspondence analysis of relative synonymous codon usages (RSCU) showed that genes on secondary axis were correlated with their GC(3S) values (all r > 0.3, p < 0.05), indicating mutational bias as an important selective force that shaped the variation in the codon usage among chloroplast genes. The Nc-plot showed that although a majority of the points with low-Nc values were lying below the expected curve, a few genes lied on the expected curve. Nc plot clearly showed that mutational bias plays a major role in codon biology across the monocot plastomes. The hydrophobicity and aromaticity of encoded proteins of each species were found to be other factors of codon usage variation. In the view of above light, besides natural selection, several other factors also likely to be involved in determining the selective constraints on codon bias in plastomes of pooid grass genomes. In addition, five codons (B. distachyon), seven codons (H. vulgare), and four codons (T. aestivum) were identified as optimal codons of the three grass chloroplasts.

"25061748","abstracttext","Galanthamine is an Amaryllidaceae alkaloid used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This compound is primarily isolated from daffodil (Narcissus spp.), snowdrop (Galanthus spp.), and summer snowflake (Leucojum aestivum). Despite its importance as a medicine, no genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of galanthamine have been identified. This absence of genetic information on biosynthetic pathways is a limiting factor in the development of synthetic biology platforms for many important botanical medicines. The paucity of information is largely due to the limitations of traditional methods for finding biochemical pathway enzymes and genes in non-model organisms. A new bioinformatic approach using several recent technological improvements was applied to search for genes in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway, first targeting methyltransferases due to strong signature amino acid sequences in the proteins. Using Illumina sequencing, a de novo transcriptome assembly was constructed for daffodil. BLAST was used to identify sequences that contain signatures for plant O-methyltransferases in this transcriptome. The program HAYSTACK was then used to identify methyltransferases that fit a model for galanthamine biosynthesis in leaf, bulb and inflorescence tissues. One candidate gene for the methylation of norbelladine to 4'-O-methylnorbelladine in the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway was identified. This methyltransferase cDNA was expressed in E. coli and the protein purified by affinity chromatography. The resulting protein was found to be a norbelladine 4'-O-methyltransferase (NpN4OMT) of the proposed galanthamine biosynthetic pathway."

"1387742","abstracttext","In order to establish alternatives to the frequently used uterotropic assay with mice, defined estrogen-sensitive cell lines (MCF-7 cells and LeC-9 cells) were used to determine the estrogenic activities of purified compounds of vegetable origin (myco- and phytoestrogens) and zearalenone-contaminated forage cereals (wheat, barley and oats). In MCF-7 cells, a human breast cancer cell line, the induction of an estrogen-specific exoprotein served as a parameter of estrogenic activities. LeC-9 cells represent a genetically transformed cell clone derived from mouse L-cells. Here, hormone-like activities were measured by the expression of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene under the control of an estrogen-responsive element. Toxic effects affecting cell viability were monitored in this system by the expression of a second reporter gene (the bacterial beta-galactosidase gene controlled by the constitutive human beta-actin promoter). Relative estrogenic activities of myco- and phytoestrogens determined with both systems are concomitant, but higher as compared to the uterotropic assay with mice."

"1502164","abstracttext","The DNA sequences for 17 plant genes for alpha-amylase (EC 3.2.1.1) were analyzed to determine their phylogenetic relationship. A phylogeny for these genes was obtained using two separate approaches, one based on molecular clock assumptions and the other based on a comparison of sequence polymorphisms (i.e., small and localized insertions) in the alpha-amylase genes. These polymorphisms are called ""alpha-amylase signatures"" because they are diagnostic of the gene subfamily to which a particular alpha-amylase gene belongs. Results indicate that the cereal alpha-amylase genes fall into two major classes: AmyA and AmyB. The AmyA class is subdivided into the Amy1 and Amy2 subfamilies previously used to classify alpha-amylase genes in barley and wheat. The AmyB class includes the Amy3 subfamily to which most of the alpha-amylase genes of rice belong. Using polymerase chain reaction and oligonucleotide primers that flank one of the two signature regions, we show that the AmyA and AmyB gene classes are present in approximately equal amounts in all grass species examined except barley. The AmyB (Amy3 subfamily) genes in the latter case are comparatively underrepresented. Additional evidence suggests that the AmyA genes appeared recently and may be confined to the grass family."

To analyse the mechanism of A121 regulation, its promoter was fused to the beta-glucuronidase reporter gene (GUS) and introduced by micro-projectile bombardment into aleurone layers of oat. With 2.3 kb of promoter sequence, the GUS expression was enhanced by GA treatment. This effect was reversed by abscisic acid (ABA). This result showed for A121, like the alpha-amylase genes, that the regulation by GA and ABA was at the level of transcription. The GA responsiveness of the promoter was retained with as little as 276 bp of promoter sequence. Sequence comparison with a GA responsive promoter of an alpha-amylase gene identified the conserved element GCAACGGCAACGATGG which is required intact for full expression of both promoters. However, there was no identifiable similarity in the cathepsin-like promoter with the GA-responsive element of alpha-amylase promoters with the consensus sequence TAACAAA, suggesting that GA affects more than one mechanism of transcriptional control."
"2562556","articletitle","Abscisic acid-responsive sequences from the em gene of wheat."
"2562556","abstracttext","We demonstrate that a chimeric gene containing the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene linked to a 646-base pair 5' fragment (-554 to +92) from the abscisic acid (ABA)-regulated Em gene from wheat is correctly expressed in transgenic tobacco. We observe high activity only in embryos of mature seeds, and immature seeds cultured on ABA show enhanced expression. Using a rice transient assay, we identify a 260-base pair fragment (-168 to +92) that accounts for the ABA-specific 15-fold to 20-fold increase in GUS expression. A 50-base pair sequence (-152 to -103) fused 5' in either orientation to a truncated cauliflower mosaic virus promoter (35S) increases GUS activity threefold in the presence of ABA. Insertion of the Em 5'-untranslated region (+6 to +86) between the 35S promoter and the ATG of GUS results in a 10-fold increase in GUS activity in the absence of ABA. These results suggest the following two functional fragments of the Em 5' region: an ABA response element from -152 to -103 and an element between +6 and +86 that quantitatively increases the ABA response."
"2987876","articletitle","Pea cytochrome oxidase subunit II gene has no intron and generates two mRNA transcripts with different 5'-termini."
"2987876","abstracttext","We have isolated and sequenced the cytochrome oxidase subunit II (COII) gene from pea mitochondria. The coding sequence (777 bp) shows over 90% homology to the COII genes from three monocotyledonous plants (rice, maize and wheat) and one dicotyledonous plant (Oenothera berteriana). Several codons are deleted, however, in the pea COII gene. Of interest is the deletion in pea of the last three codons, including the stop codon, found at the 3' end of the other four COII genes. Instead, a new stop codon has been created due to a single-base substitution at the 13th bp downstream from the position of the original stop codon. This pea gene does not contain an intron which is found in all three monocots. Two distinct 5' termini of the pea COII transcripts have been identified by S1 nuclease mapping, one at 285 bp (site I) and the other at 302 bp (site II) upstream from the ATG codon. They are located at two identical sites within nearly perfect direct repeats. Transcripts with the 5' end corresponding to site I occur five time more frequently than those with the 5' end corresponding to site II. Both transcripts have the same 3' terminus which has been mapped to be at 193 to 195 bp downstream from the stop codon."
"3608404","articletitle","The gene coding for tropoelastin is represented as a single copy sequence in the haploid sheep genome."
"3608404","abstracttext","The identity of the primary in vitro translation products of fetal sheep nuchal ligament elastin mRNA was confirmed as two distinct polypeptides of 63 Kdal and 65 Kdal in both rabbit reticulocyte and wheat germ extract cell-free translation systems. Both polypeptides were co-translationally processed by a microsomal membrane signal peptidase, with the removal of 20-25 amino acid residues. A single (3,5 kb) RNA species encodes both tropoelastin polypeptides. Restriction endonuclease mapping of sheep genomic DNA by hydridization with two radiolabelled genomic DNA fragments containing sequences coding for sheep tropoelastin (pSE1-1,3 and pSE1-0.7,) indicated the presence of a single elastin gene. The elastin gene copy number was further quantitated by comparison of hybridisation of pSE1-1.3 and pSE1-0.7 to slot-blots and Southern transfers of sheep genomic DNA and to standard curves constructed with each clone. These results clearly demonstrate that each of these sequences is represented only once per haploid genome, suggesting that the two tropoelastin polypeptides are products of a single elastin gene."

"2193030","abstracttext","Mirabilis antiviral protein (MAP), a ribosome-inactivating protein, exhibits inhibitory effects on both plant virus infection and protein synthesis. To study these functions by site-specific mutagenesis, the total synthetic gene of MAP was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli. However, the growth of the host was inhibited by the products, and the yield of MAP was very low. To improve the system for expressing MAP, an expression vector, pSH7, was constructed. This vector is based on the high copy number plasmid pUC19 and includes PL promoter and temperature-sensitive cI857 repressor. The plasmid also contains the ompA signal sequence and the total synthetic MAP gene. The MAP gene was expressed and its product was secreted into the culture medium after E. coli transformants were cultivated at 30 degrees C and the temperature was raised to 42 degrees C. The secreted MAP was then purified and characterized. This protein was identical to native MAP as determined by its mobility in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the amino acid sequence at the NH2 terminus, and its inhibitory effect on in vitro protein synthesis. MAP was found to inhibit the in vitro protein synthesis of rabbit reticulocyte and wheat germ. It further showed an IC50 concentration of approximately 200 nM in an E. coli in vitro translation system in contrast to ricin A-chain, a well known ribosome-inactivating protein."

"6745240","abstracttext","A maize genomic clone containing a zein gene (Z4) was inserted into the T-region of the T37 Ti plasmid. Agrobacterium tumefaciens cells carrying this modified Ti plasmid were used to inoculate sunflower stemlets. Callus tissue active in nopaline synthesis was grown from a single transformed cell. DNA analysis of this tissue showed that the zein gene plus T-DNA was present in approximately 12 copies per diploid sunflower genome. A 1000 +/- 100 base RNA homologous to a zein probe could be isolated from the engineered sunflower tissue and the 5' end of this RNA was determined by S1 nuclease mapping. Two transcription start sites were detected. The positions of these transcription start sites and the ratio of the amounts of the two transcripts are identical for the Z4 gene in sunflower and in maize endosperm. Although the zein RNA isolated from the engineered sunflower tissue could be translated in a wheat germ system to yield an immuno-precipitable protein of the expected mol. wt., the presence of the zein protein in the sunflower tissue could not be demonstrated."

"7736615","abstracttext","The chloroplast trnP-trnW-petG gene cluster has been identified in the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of sugar beet (Beta vulgaris). The chloroplast-derived trnW gene is transcribed in the mitochondria; the other two genes, however, do not seem to be transcribed. This gene cluster is also present in the mitochondrial genomes of two wild Beta species, B. trigyna and B. webbiana. Sugar beet and the two wild relatives share 100% sequence identity in the coding regions of both the mitochondrial trnP and trnW genes. On the other hand, the petG genes from the wild Beta mtDNAs were found to be disrupted either by a 5-bp duplication (B. trigyna) or by a deletion of the 5' region (B. webbiana). A data-base search revealed that a conserved sequence of 60 bp is present in the trnP-trnW intergenic region of the mitochondrial genomes of the three Beta species as well as in other higher plants, including wheat and maize, and that the conserved sequence is absent from the chloroplast counterpart. Our results thus favour the hypothesis of a monophyletic origin of the trnP-trnW-petG cluster found in the plant mitochondrial genomes examined."

"8012407","abstracttext","To establish a system for genetically engineered cell fate mapping, different vectors carrying the Lc gene, a member of the R gene family, were delivered into embryonic and meristematic cells of maize by the microinjection technique. Vectors in which the Lc cDNA is driven either by a constitutive promoter (CaMV 35S), with or without the Adh1 intron 1 of maize, or a tissue-specific promoter (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, PEPC) as well as self-replicating wheat dwarf virus (WDV) vectors carrying a Lc-expression-cassette, have been tested. The ability of these vectors to transactivate was evaluated in mesophyll-derived protoplasts of the maize genotype appropriate for these microinjection experiments. The expression product of the introduced Lc gene can substitute for mutated R and B loci, resulting in anthocyanin production. Analogous results were obtained by microinjection into organized tissues, where transactivation of anthocyanin biosynthesis resulted in pigmented sectors in somatic embryos (B79) and in the leaves of plants regenerated from the cultivated shoot apical meristems (K55, r-g, b). The tissue-specific appearance of pigmented sectors in leaves, using the mesophyll-specific PEPC promoter suggests the possibility of using this approach for layer-specific cell fate studies. The presence of the introduced plasmids in leaves showing red sectors 20-30 days after injection was proven by PCR analysis."

"8332491","abstracttext","Analysis of TBP gene sequences from a variety of species for clustering of short sequence motifs and for over- and underrepresentation of short sequence motifs suggests involvement of slippage in the recent evolution of the TBP N-terminal domains in metazoans, Acanthamoeba and wheat. AGC, GCA and CAG are overrepresented in TBP genes of other species, suggesting that opa arrays were amplified from motifs overrepresented in ancestral species. The phylogenetic distribution of recently slippage-derived sequences in TBP is similar to that observed in the large subunit ribosomal RNAs, suggesting a propensity for certain evolutionary lineages to incorporate slippage-generated motifs into protein-coding as well as ribosomal RNA genes. Because length increase appears to have taken place independently in lineages leading to vertebrates, insects and nematodes, TBP N-terminal domains in these lineages are not homologous. All gene duplications in the TBP gene family appear to have been recent events despite strong protein sequence similarity between TRF and P. falciparum TBP. The enlargement of the TBP N-terminal domain may have coincided with acquisition of new functions and may have accompanied molecular coevolution with domains of other proteins, resulting in the acquisition of new or more complex mechanisms of transcription regulation."

"8564300","abstracttext","The cis-regulatory function of a far-upstream sequence (-1,711 to -186) of the promoter of the wheat gene for histone H3 (TH012) was analyzed in cultured rice and tobacco cells in a transient expression system with the gene for beta-D-glucuronidase as a reporter gene. The far-upstream sequence was necessary for full activity of the H3 promoter in rice cells but did not enhance the activity of the proximal promoter in tobacco cells. Dissection analysis of the far-upstream sequence revealed the existence of several positive and negative cis-acting sequences in this region, some of which functioned differently in rice and tobacco cells. In gain-of-function experiments with rice cells, the sequence from -848 to -704, containing the CCAAT and octamer (CaCGGATC) motifs, functioned in an orientation-independent manner, whereas the sequence from -703 to -486 functioned in an orientation-dependent manner. By contrast, both sequences exhibited an orientation-dependent cis-function in tobacco cells. These findings suggest that some cis-regulatory sequences in the far-upstream region of the H3 promoter function differently in rice and tobacco cells."
"8581302","articletitle","Reprogramming of rye rDNA in triticale during microsporogenesis."
"8581302","abstracttext","To test the hypothesis that interspecific genomic and chromosome interactions leading to nucleolar dominance could be reprogrammed in meiosis, we compared the expression of distinct nucleolar organizing region (NOR) loci in hexaploid triticale root tip meristematic cells, pollen mother cells and young pollen grains. Interphase and metaphase cells were silver stained to quantify nucleoli and active NOR loci respectively. A marked difference in the ribosomal RNA gene activity of each locus was observed when different types of cells were compared: in somatic and pollen mother cells, rRNA gene activity was mainly restricted to major wheat NORs (1B and 6B) with only a small contribution from rye NORs (1R). In contrast, in young pollen grains, all NORs present, including the 1R NORs, were consistently active. The expression of all NORs just after meiosis is considered to be a consequence of meiotic reprogramming of rye origin rDNA. Gene reprogramming mediated by the resetting of methylation patterns established early in embryogenesis is suggested to be responsible for the differential expression of the NORs of rye origin in distinct developmental stages of triticale."

"8148881","abstracttext","A reproducible transformation system for hexaploid wheat was developed based on particle bombardment of scutellar tissue of immature embryos. Particle bombardment was carried out using a PDS 1000/He gun. Plant material was bombarded with the plasmid pDB1 containing the beta-glucuronidase gene (uidA) under the control of the actin-1 promoter of rice, and the selectable marker gene bar (phosphinothricin acetyltransferase) under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter. Selection was carried out using the herbicide Basta (Glufosinate-ammonium). From a total number of 1050 bombarded immature embryos, in seven independent transformation experiments, 59 plants could be regenerated. Putative transformants were screened for enzyme activity by the histochemical GUS assay using cut leaf material and by spraying the whole plants with an aqueous solution of the herbicide Basta. Twelve regenerants survived Basta spraying and showed GUS-activity. Southern-blot analysis indicated the presence of introduced foreign genes in the genomic DNA of the transformants and both marker genes were present in all plants analysed. To date, four plants have been grown to maturity and set seed. Histochemically stained pollen grains showed a 1:1 segregation of the uidA gene in all plants tested. A 3:1 segregation of the introduced genes was demonstrated by enzyme activity tests and Southern blot analysis of R1 plants."

"8219090","abstracttext","The cis-regulatory elements that confer cell cycle-dependent expression to the wheat histone H3 gene were investigated in rice cells (Oc strain) transformed with H3/GUS chimeric genes. 5' deletion mutants of the H3 promoter region (from -1711, -908 or -185 to +57 relative to the transcription start site) were joined to the coding sequence of the bacterial beta-glucuronidase (GUS) gene then introduced stably into rice cells. S1 analyses of the RNA from transformed rice cells whose cell cycles had been synchronized by treatment with aphidicolin showed that the steady-state levels of the transcripts from chimeric genes were altered with the change in DNA synthesis and the content of rice H3 mRNA throughout the cell cycle. Even though H3 promoter activity decreased as 5' deletion proceeded, transcripts from the chimeric genes showed increases, as much as 10-fold 1 h after release from the aphidicolin block, which were rapidly lost over the next 4 h. The results suggest that the 242 bp sequence from -185 to +57, which contains the basal promoter region, confers the S phase-specific expression of the H3 gene and that the upstream sequence from position -186 is required for the full activity of this promoter."

"8938400","abstracttext","A synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (pgfp) was constructed to improve GFP expression in plants. Corn and tobacco protoplast transient assays showed that pgfp gave about 20-fold brighter fluorescence than the wild-type gene (gfp). Replacement of the serine at position 65 with a threonine (S65Tpgfp) or a cysteine (S65Cpgfp) yielded 100- to 120-fold brighter fluorescence than wild-type gfp upon excitation with 490-nm light. Incorporation of a plant intron into the coding region yielded an additional 1.4-fold improvement, for a cumulative improvement of about 150-fold in fluorescence at 490-nm excitation. Various versions of pgfp were also stably introduced into corn, wheat, tobacco, and Arabidopsis plants. Bright-green fluorescence was observed with a fluorescence microscope in virtually all examined tissues of transgenic monocots and dicots. In the case of Arabidopsis, expression of the pgfp gene under the enhanced 355 promoter of the cauliflower mosaic virus produced green fluorescence that was readily detectable by eye using a hand-held, long-wave ultraviolet lamp and/or a black-light source."

"8709208","abstracttext","Many viruses use stop codon readthrough as a strategy to produce extended coat or replicase proteins. The stop codon of the barley yellow dwarf virus (PAV serotype) coat protein gene is read through at a low rate. This produces an extended polypeptide which becomes part of the virion. We have analyzed the cis-acting sequences in the barley yellow dwarf virus PAV genome required for this programmed readthrough in vitro in wheat germ extracts and reticulocyte lysates and in vivo in oat protoplasts. Two regions 3' to the stop codon were required. Deletion of sections containing the first 5 of the 16 CCN NNN repeats located 3' of the stop codon greatly reduced readthrough in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, readthrough also required a second, more distal element that is located 697 to 758 bases 3' of the stop codon within the readthrough open reading frame. This element also functioned in vivo in oat protoplasts when placed more than 2 kb from the coat protein gene stop in the untranslated region following a GUS reporter gene. This is the first report of a long-range readthrough signal in viruses."

"9720200","abstracttext","The gene ce1A, encoding an endoglucanase from the strain Bacillus sp. BP-23, was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The nucleotide sequence of a 1867-bp DNA fragment containing the ce1A gene was determined, revealing an open reading frame of 1200 nucleotides that encodes a protein of 44,803 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the encoded enzyme shows high homology to those of enzymes belonging to subtype 4 of the family-A cellulases. The ce1A gene product synthesized in E. coli showed activity on carboxymethylcellulose and lichenan but no activity was found on Avicel. Activity was enhanced in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+ and Ca2+ and showed its maximum at 40 degrees C and pH 4.0. Study of the performance of Ce1A on paper manufacture from agricultural fibres showed that treatment with the enzyme improved the properties of the pulp and the quality of paper. Ce1A treatment enhanced the physical properties (stretch and tensile index) of paper from wheat straw, while dewatering properties were slightly diminished. Electron-microscope analysis showed that the surface of straw fibres was modified by Ce1A."

"9482816","abstracttext","Genetic mapping of wheat, maize, and rice and other grass species with common DNA probes has revealed remarkable conservation of gene content and gene order over the 60 million years of radiation of Poaceae. The linear organization of genes in some nine different genomes differing in basic chromosome number from 5 to 12 and nuclear DNA amount from 400 to 6,000 Mb, can be described in terms of only 25 ""rice linkage blocks."" The extent to which this intergenomic colinearity is confounded at the micro level by gene duplication and micro-rearrangements is still an open question. Nevertheless, it is clear that the elucidation of the organization of the economically important grasses with larger genomes, such as maize (2n = 10, 4,500 Mb DNA), will, to a greater or lesser extent, be predicted from sequence analysis of smaller genomes such as rice, with only 400 Mb, which in turn may be greatly aided by knowledge of the entire sequence of Arabidopsis, which may be available as soon as the turn of the century. Comparative genetics will provide the key to unlock the genomic secrets of crop plants with bigger genomes than Homo sapiens."
"9491074","articletitle","Low temperature-stimulated phosphorylation regulates the binding of nuclear factors to the promoter of Wcs120, a cold-specific gene in wheat."
"9491074","abstracttext","The Wcs120 gene encodes a highly abundant protein which appears to play an important role during cold acclimation of wheat. To understand the regulatory mechanism controlling its expression at low temperature, the promoter region has been characterized. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays using short promoter fragments revealed the presence in nuclear extracts from non-acclimated (NA) plants of multiple DNA-binding proteins which interact with several elements. In contrast, no DNA-binding activity was observed in the nuclear extracts from cold-acclimated (CA) plants. In vitro dephosphorylation of these CA nuclear extracts with alkaline phosphatase restored the binding activity. Moreover, okadaic acid (a potent phosphatase inhibitor) markedly stimulated the in vivo accumulation of the WCS120 family of proteins. This suggests that protein phosphatases PP1 and/or PP2A negatively regulate the expression of the Wcs120 gene. In addition, both Ca(2+)-dependent and Ca(2+)-independent kinase activities were found to be significantly higher in the CA nuclear extracts. Western analysis using antibodies directed against protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms showed that a PKCgamma homolog (84 kDa) is selectively translocated into the nucleus in response to low temperature. Taken together, our results suggest that, in vivo, the expression of the Wcs120 gene may be regulated by nuclear factors whose binding activity is modulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism."

"9588026","abstracttext","Two histone H1 genes, TH315 and TH325, were isolated from a wheat genomic library. Nucleotide sequence analysis and comparison with other histone gene promoters revealed that the promoters of both genes contain many characteristic motifs conserved among plant histone H1 genes. They are 6 novel short stretches, named CS1 to CS6, and already documented elements or their relatives such as Oct, Oct-like (OLS), Nona-like (NonaLS), CCAAT box, and TATA box. Transient expression experiments with the TH315 promoter/GUS chimeric gene and its mutagenized derivatives showed that two Oct motifs, OLS, and CCAAT box are positive cis-acting elements. NonaLS and CS4 were suggested to be positive cis-acting elements and CS5 and CS6 to be negative elements. An Oct motif and CCAAT box constitutes a type III element and the 202-bp sequence containing these elements from -128 to +74 of the TH315 gene was shown to be sufficient to confer S phase-specific expression. The type III element is found in all plant histone H1 and H2B genes, suggesting that it is a subtype-specific element. Most plant histone genes have one of the type I, II, and III elements. We propose to classify the plant histone genes into three classes, based on the context of Oct in the promoters."

"10191192","abstracttext","It has previously been reported that complementary-sense gene products of wheat dwarf virus (WDV), a geminivirus of the genus Mastrevirus that infects monocotyledonous plants, bind to human and maize retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. Rb proteins control cell-cycle progression by sequestering transcription factors required for entry into S-phase, suggesting that the virus modifies the cellular environment to produce conditions suitable for viral DNA replication. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, we have investigated whether the complementary-sense gene products of bean yellow dwarf virus, a mastrevirus that is adapted to dicotyledonous plants, also bind maize Rb protein. We demonstrate that whereas RepA binds to Rb protein, Rep does not, suggesting that RepA alone regulates host gene expression and progression of cells to S-phase. RepA mutants containing L --> I, C --> S, C --> G, and E --> Q mutations within the consensus Rb protein binding motif LXCXE retained the ability to bind to Rb, but with reduced efficiency. Most notably, the E --> Q mutation reduced binding by approximately 95%. Nonetheless, all LXCXE mutants were able to replicate in tobacco protoplasts and to systemically infect Nicotiana benthamiana and bean, in which they produced wild-type symptoms."

The objectives of this study were to physically localize gene-containing regions of the group 1 short arm, enrich these regions with markers, and study the distribution of genes and recombination. We focused on the major gene-rich region (""1S0.8 region"") and identified 75 useful genes along with 93 RFLP markers by comparing 35 different maps of Poaceae species. The RFLP markers were tested by gel blot DNA analysis of wheat group 1 nullisomic-tetrasomic lines, ditelosomic lines, and four single-break deletion lines for chromosome arm 1BS. Seventy-three of the 93 markers mapped to group 1 and detected 91 loci on chromosome 1B. Fifty-one of these markers mapped to two major gene-rich regions physically encompassing 14% of the short arm. Forty-one marker loci mapped to the 1S0.8 region and 10 to 1S0.5 region. Two cDNA markers mapped in the centromeric region and the remaining 24 loci were on the long arm. About 82% of short arm recombination was observed in the 1S0.8 region and 17% in the 1S0.5 region. Less than 1% recombination was observed for the remaining 85% of the physical arm length."

"11454226","abstracttext","The Amy32b gene is a member of the low-pI alpha-amylase gene family of barley, whose expression is tightly regulated by hormones in the aleurone layer. Four cis-elements are known to be important for the GA induction of this gene: GARE, amylase box, pyrimidine box, and O2S. These sequences are located between -101 and -149 relative to the transcription start site. In the present work, we have created a series of Amy32b promoter-GUS reporter constructs introducing mutations in the -79 to -93 region. Using a transient expression system, we have functionally defined an additional region (-81 to -89) essential for the GA activation of the Amy32b promoter. This region is highly conserved among barley, wheat, and wild oat low-pI alpha-amylase promoters. Interestingly, in contrast with the variability in the relative distances among other cis-elements, this region maintains a nearly constant distance to GARE, which suggests that the function of these elements might be coupled. The involvement of this and other sequences in the transactivation of Amy32b by a transcription factor, GAMyb, has also been studied. Our results indicate that the only indispensable element for the GAMyb transactivation of the alpha-amylase promoter is GARE. The present work brings new evidence to the proposed model that considers the GAMyb-GARE interaction as a critical point for the GA induction of alpha-amylase genes, but also strengthens the notion that multiple sequences are required for full regulation of alpha-amylase promoters."

"11129043","abstracttext","The alb1 mutant of Lotus japonicus (Ljsym74) forms empty nodules in which most of the bacteria remain in abnormally enlarged infection threads and fail to enter the host plant cells. The alb1 mutant was also found to be defective in differentiation of ramified nodule vascular bundles; only a single vascular bundle differentiates at the proximal end of the alb1 nodules and it fails to differentiate further. Histochemical analysis using fluorescein-conjugated wheat-germ agglutinin (F-WGA) indicated that the mutation in the ALB1 gene specifically affects the differentiation of vascular bundles in nodules. Analysis of nodulin gene expression revealed that the expression of an early nodulin gene, ENOD40, was very low in alb1 nodules. At early developmental stages of alb1 nodules, the pattern of ENOD40 transcription was essentially the same as that in wild-type nodules; transcripts were localized in dividing cortical cells and in the pericycle of the root stele opposite nodule primordia, as in wild-type nodules. However, mature alb1 nodules exhibited very weak or no expression of ENOD40 in the peripheral cells of the undeveloped nodule vascular bundle. The ENOD40 expression pattern in alb1 nodules is distinct from that in another ineffective mutant, fen1 (Ljsym76), in which ENOD40 expression persists prior to premature senescence. These findings lead us to speculate that ENOD40 may play a role in the differentiation of nodule vascular bundles."

Ninety core markers selected for low copy number, high polymorphism, and even spacing along the chromosome delineate the 100 bins on the map. The average bin size is 17 cM. Use of bin assignments enables comparison among different maize mapping populations and experiments including those involving cytogenetic stocks, mutants, or quantitative trait loci. Integration of nonmaize markers in the map extends the resources available for gene discovery beyond the boundaries of maize mapping information into the expanse of map, sequence, and phenotype information from other grass species.

We have previously shown that an oligolysine-RGD peptide that condenses plasmid DNA and binds to cell surface integrins can mediate increased internalisation of plasmid DNA into cells and synergistic enhancement of gene expression when complexed to a cationic lipid. In this report, we show that this enhancement is due to increased nuclear transfer of the plasmid DNA. We have applied the digitonin-permeabilised cell system that has been well established for the study of the nuclear transport of proteins to examine the nuclear transfer of plasmid DNA. Nuclear transfer of plasmid DNA complexed to an oligolysine-RGD peptide and lipofectamine appears to be an energy-dependent process involving the nuclear pore complex, since it is inhibited at 4 degrees C and by treatment with wheat germ agglutinin or with an antibody to the nuclear pore complex which all block nuclear protein import. In accordance with active nuclear transport, we have shown that all these treatments inhibit expression of a luciferase reporter plasmid in permeabilised cells. Nuclear transfer of pDNA is enhanced in mitotic cells, but cell division is not a prerequisite for transfer. We propose that the oligolysine-RGD peptide acts as a nuclear localisation signal and that the cationic lipid is more important for cell entry and endosome destabilisation than nuclear transfer."
"15617864","articletitle","Gene, gut and schizophrenia: the meeting point for the gene-environment interaction in developing schizophrenia."
"15617864","abstracttext","Both schizophrenia and celiac disease involve a genetic component. Several lines of evidence have shown a genetic relationship between these two conditions. Celiac disease is characterized by damage to the microscopic finger-like projections called villi, which line the small intestine and play a significant role in digestion, due to an inflammatory condition caused by a reaction to wheat gluten or related rye and barley proteins. Celiac disease represents not only malabsorption leading to a poor nutritional condition but also an alteration of gut permeability. Individuals with a history of a childhood celiac condition have a raised risk of developing schizophrenia. Psychotic symptoms often occur in adult celiac disease. It can be hypothesized that apart from malnutrition, the meeting point for the gene-environment interaction may be an alteration in gut permeability, in which the gut may lose its capacity to block exogenous psychosis-causing substances that may enter the body thus causing the development of schizophrenia and other mental conditions. To support this hypothesis, the conditional test was conducted to look at the combined effect of the CLDN5 gene involved in forming permeability barriers and the DQB1 gene that has been found to be associated with celiac disease. The results demonstrate that these two genes possibly work together in conferring a susceptibility to schizophrenia."

"12435269","abstracttext","Feruloyl esterases, a subclass of the carboxylic acid esterases (EC 3.1.1.1), are able to hydrolyse the ester bond between the hydroxycinnamic acids and sugars present in the plant cell wall. The enzymes have been classified as type A or type B, based on their substrate specificity for aromatic moieties. We show that Neurospora crassa has the ability to produce multiple ferulic acid esterase activities depending upon the length of fermentation with either sugar beet pulp or wheat bran substrates. A gene identified on the basis of its expression on sugar beet pulp has been cloned and overexpressed in Pichia pastoris. The gene encodes a single-domain ferulic acid esterase, which represents the first report of a non-modular type B enzyme (fae-1 gene; GenBank accession no. AJ293029). The purified recombinant protein has been shown to exhibit concentration-dependent substrate inhibition (K(m) 0.048 mM, K (i) 2.5 mM and V(max) 8.2 units/mg against methyl 3,4-dihydroxycinnamate). The kinetic behaviour of the non-modular enzyme is discussed in terms of the diversity in the roles of the feruloyl esterases in the mobilization of plant cell wall materials and their respective modes of action."

"12096816","abstracttext","The genomes of grasses are very different in terms of size, ploidy level and chromosome number. Despite these significant differences, it was found by comparative mapping that the linear order (colinearity) of genetic markers and genes is very well conserved between different grass genomes. The potential of such conservation has been exploited in several directions, e.g. in defining rice as a model genome for grasses and in designing better strategies for positional cloning in large genomes. Recently, the development of large insert libraries in species such as maize, rice, barley and diploid wheat has allowed the study of large stretches of DNA sequence and has provided insight into gene organization in grasses. It was found that genes are not distributed randomly along the chromosomes and that there are clusters of high gene density in species with large genomes. Comparative analysis performed at the DNA sequence level has demonstrated that colinearity between the grass genomes is retained at the molecular level (microcolinearity) in most cases. However, detailed analysis has also revealed a number of exceptions to microcolinearity, which have given insight into mechanisms that are involved in grass-genome evolution. In some cases, the use of rice as a model to support gene isolation from other grass genomes will be complicated by local rearrangements. In this Botanical Briefing, we present recent progress and future prospects of comparative genomics in grasses."

"12669198","abstracttext","We investigated a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the Wx-D1 gene, which was found in a mutant waxy wheat, and which expressed the Wx-D1 protein (granule-bound starch synthase I) as shown by immunoblot analysis. We also assayed starch synthase activity of granule-bound proteins. Using 22 doubled-haploid (DH) lines and 172 F(5) lines derived from the wild type x the mutant, we detected SNP via a PCR-based (dCAPS) marker. Amplified PCR products from Wx-D1 gene-specific primers, followed by mismatched primers designed for dCAPS analysis, were digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme. The two alleles, and the heterozygote genotype were easily and rapidly discriminated by gel-electrophoresis resolution to reveal SNP. All progeny lines that have the SNP of the mutant allele were waxy. Integrating the results of dCAPS analysis, immunoblot analysis and assays of starch synthase activity of granule-bound proteins indicates that the SNP in the Wx-D1 gene was responsible for its waxy character. This dCAPS marker is therefore useful as a marker to introduce the mutant allele into elite breeding lines."

"12694579","abstracttext","Coeliac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy) is a common, polygenic and multifactorial disorder that serves as a pioneering model for the study of inflammatory disease. A major environmental factor is known (ingested gluten from wheat), and there is unprecedented genetic and functional evidence pinpointing HLA-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 ( DQ2) and DQA1*03-DQB1*0302 ( DQ8) in disease predisposition. We discuss the current state of play in coeliac disease genetics, focussing particularly on the HLA complex. Emerging evidence suggests that additional HLA risk loci exert weak effects, independent of DQA1*05-DQB1*02, on the B8-DR3-DQ2 haplotype. There is also good evidence from linkage studies of disease gene(s) on chromosome 5q. We discuss the role and implications of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype blocks in complex disease gene mapping. We briefly address findings from studies of animal models for chronic inflammatory disease, and consider roles for both common genes associated with multiple inflammatory diseases, and genes unique to coeliac disease. The coeliac genetics research community has established a sound foundation for the identification of additional disease genes in the not-too-distant future. Functional studies will play a critical role, and coeliac disease has a promising future in this respect. Coeliac disease continues to function as a model disorder, facilitating the development and implementation of complex disease gene mapping strategies."

"12807785","abstracttext","Precise control of chromosome pairing is vital for conferring meiotic, and hence reproductive, stability in sexually reproducing polyploids. Apart from the Ph1 locus of wheat that suppresses homeologous pairing, little is known about the activity of genes that contribute to the cytological diploidization of allopolyploids. In oilseed rape (Brassica napus) haploids, the amount of chromosome pairing at metaphase I (MI) of meiosis varies depending on the varieties the haploids originate from. In this study, we combined a segregation analysis with a maximum-likelihood approach to demonstrate that this variation is genetically based and controlled mainly by a gene with a major effect. A total of 244 haploids were produced from F(1) hybrids between a high- and a low-pairing variety (at the haploid stage) and their meiotic behavior at MI was characterized. Likelihood-ratio statistics were used to demonstrate that the distribution of the number of univalents among these haploids was consistent with the segregation of a diallelic major gene, presumably in a background of polygenic variation. Our observations suggest that this gene, named PrBn, is different from Ph1 and could thus provide complementary information on the meiotic stabilization of chromosome pairing in allopolyploid species."

"12890559","abstracttext","Two different cDNA clones encoding asperagine synthetase (AS: EC 6.3.5.4.) were cloned from barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Alexis). The corresponding genes were designated HvAS1 (GenBank no AF307145) and HvAS2 (GenBank no AY193714). Chromosomal mapping using wheat-barley addition lines revealed that the HvAS1 gene is located on the long arm of barley chromosome 5, while the HvAS2 gene maps to the short arm of chromosome 3. Both genes are expressed in barley leaves according to RT-PCR analysis but only the HvAS1 gene expression can be detected in roots. Northern blots show no expression of HvAS1 in plants grown under a normal 16 h light/8 h dark cycle but after 10 h of continuous darkness, transcript appears and mRNA accumulates over a 48-h period of dark treatment. In roots, low-level expression of HvAS1 could be detected and the expression level appears to be unaffected by light. A polyclonal antibody was raised against the HvAS1 protein and used in Western blot analysis. The AS protein accumulated during a 48-h period of dark treatment, following the increase in HvAS1 transcript."

"16110181","abstracttext","The Indian bread wheat cultivar HD2009 has maintained its partial resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust in India since its release in 1976. To examine the nature, number and mode of inheritance of its genes for partial leaf rust and stripe rust resistance, this cultivar was crossed with cultivar WL711, which is susceptible to leaf rust and stripe rust. The F1, F2, F3 and F5 generations from this cross were assessed separately for adult plant disease severity under artificial epidemic of race 77-5 of leaf rust and race 46S119 of stripe rust. Segregation for rust reaction in the F2, F3 and F5 generations indicated that resistance to each of these rust diseases is based on 2 genes, each with additive effects. Although the leaf rust resistance of HD2009 is similar in expression to that conferred by the gene Lr34, but unlike the wheats carrying this gene, cultivar HD2009 did not show leaf tip necrosis, a morphological marker believed to be tightly linked to the leaf rust resistance gene Lr34. Thus, the non-hypersensitive resistance of HD2009 was ascribed to genes other than Lr34."

"15972251","abstracttext","Full-length coding sequences of the beta-tubulin gene (tubA) were PCR-amplified and sequenced from 42 Phaeosphaeria isolates, including 16 P. nodorum and 23 P. avenaria species from cereals, two Polish isolates from rye (Secale cereale L.), and one isolate from dallis grass (Paspalum dilatatum Poir). A tubA gene of size 1556bp was identified in wheat- and barley-biotype P. nodorum (PN-w and PN-b), P. avenaria f. sp. avenaria (Paa), homothallic P. avenaria f. sp. triticea (P.a.t.) (Pat1) and the P.a.t. isolate (Pat3) from the State of Washington. The tubA gene length polymorphisms were detected in two P.a.t. isolates (Pat2) from foxtail barley (Hordeum jubatum L.), one from dallis grass and two Polish isolates from rye. These size differences were due to the variation of intron lengths among these three Phaeosphaeria species. All Phaeosphaeria isolates have identical 1344bp exons that can be translated into a 447 amino acid beta-tubulin. Like glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, the beta-tubulin amino acid sequence was identical in all Phaeosphaeria species used in this study, with the exception of the two Pat2 isolates. Six amino acid differences were evident in the beta-tubulin of these Pat2 isolates."

"14731254","abstracttext","Apetala2/ethylene-responsive factor (AP2/ERF) proteins are AP2 domain-containing transcription factors and form the second largest transcription factor family in plants. Biological functions of many of these AP2 proteins are still unknown. Here, we report the characterisation of a novel member of the AP2/ERF superfamily, dehydration-responsive factor 1 (HvDRF1) from barley, and its role in abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated gene regulation. The expression of HvDRF1 was upregulated in barley leaves and roots under drought, salt or ABA treatment, and in embryos during seed maturation. Three forms of HvDRF1 transcripts were produced through alternative splicing, two of which encoded AP2 proteins. This alternative splicing pattern was also observed in a wheat homologue gene, TaDRF1. Both of HvDRF1 AP2 proteins acted as transcriptional activators, capable of activating the promoter activity of an ABA-inducible HVA1s in barley. In vitro DNA-binding analysis using synthetic oligonucleotides revealed that HvDRF1 AP2 protein bound preferably to a CT-rich element (T(T/A)ACCGCCTT). HvDRF1 activity on the activation of HVA1s expression in barley leaves was markedly enhanced by HvABI5 (a bZIP transcription factor), ABA or drought treatment. These results indicate that the HvDRF1 transcriptional activator co-operates with other ABA-responsive factors in the upregulation of stress gene expression through an ABA-dependent pathway."

"18436988","abstracttext","The genetic basis of seedling and adult-plant leaf rust resistance was analysed in wheat lines CS 2A/2M 4/2 and CS 2D/2M 3/8, which are reference lines for the leaf rust resistance gene Lr28. Some seedlings of CS 2A/2M 4/2 were susceptible to Indian Puccinia triticina (Pt) pathotypes 77-1, 77-2 and 77-5. These susceptible seedlings exhibited resistance at the adult-plant growth stage. In contrast, CS 2D/2M 3/8 showed resistance to all Pt pathotypes both at the seedling and adult-plant growth stages. The analysis of inheritance in the susceptible plants of CS 2A/2M 4/2 (CS 2A/2M 4/2 APR selection) and CS 2D/2M 3/8 against Pt 77-5 (the frequently occurring Pt pathotype from the Indian subcontinent), indicated that line CS 2D/2M 3/8 was fixed for a dominant gene, presumed to be Lr28, whereas line CS 2A/2M 4/2 was heterogeneous for Lr28. The adult-plant resistance in the CS 2A/2M 4/2 APR selection was conferred by an unknown recessive gene."

"18523864","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum trichothecene producing isolates can be broadly divided into two chemotypes based on the production of the 8- ketotrichothecenes deoxynivalenol (DON) and nivalenol (NIV). Functional Tri13 gene required for the production of NIV and 4- acetyl NIV, whereas in the isolates producing DON and its acetylated derivates, this gene is nonfunctional. In this study, a total of 57 isolates from different fields of Mazandaran province, Iran were identified as F. graminearum using classical methods and species specific primers. In order to assess the potential of isolates to produce NIV or DON, we used PCR to determine whether isolates carried a functional or nonfunctional Tri13 gene. Out of the 57 tested F. graminearum isolates with Tri13 PCR assays, 46 yielded an amplicon similar to the size predicted for nivalenol production, while 11 yielded an amplicon similar to the size predicted for deoxynivalenol production. From regions where more than one F. graminearum isolate was obtained, isolates were not exclusively of a single chemotype. It seems that genetic diversity among the isolates has relation with geographical region and wheat cultivar. The assay can provide information about the distribution of Tri13 haplotype that can be used in tracing of trichothecene contaminated samples."

"16453890","abstracttext","Gibberellin (GA(3))-responsive aleurone protoplasts isolated from Avena sativa have been successfully used as a transient expression system to analyse promoter fusions between the wheat alpha-amylase gene alpha-Amy2/54 and the reporter gene GUS. Following PEG-mediated uptake of plasmid DNA, transient expression directed by the alpha-Amy2/54 promoter was found to be regulated in the same way as the endogenous oat alpha-amylase genes. Expression was thus dependent on the inclusion of GA(3) in the protoplast incubation media, could not be detected before a lag phase of 2 days following transformation and was inhibited by simultaneous addition of abscisic acid (ABA) with GA(3) to the media. In contrast, expression from the CaMV 35S promoter in the same system was not affected by GA(3) or ABA and could be detected 1 day after transformation. Introduction of a further three different promoters into the aleurone protoplasts confirmed that GA(3) specifically controlled transient expression from the alpha-Amy2/54 promoter only. Promoter deletions of the alpha-Amy2/54: GUS fusion demonstrated that sequences within 300 bp of the start of transcription of the gene were sufficient to direct high-level expression that was regulated by GA(3) and ABA."

"16477132","abstracttext","To evaluate the effect of over-expressed Mn-superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) on stress resistance in maize, an over-expression vector with MnSOD gene of wheat was constructed and used to transform embryonic calli of elite maize inbred line by gene gun. After screening with a concentration gradient of hygromycin, 9 plants were regenerated from the positive calli and reproduced fertile seeds, 5 of which were shown to be positive by PCR and Southern blot analysis. This result indicated that the exotic gene had been integrated in maize genome. SOD enzyme extracts were separated by non-denatured polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of gradient concentration. After inhibition with 5 mmol/L H(2)O(2) to FeSOD and Cu/ZnSOD, MnSOD enzyme activity was assayed with nitrotetrazolium chloride blue staining. All the 5 plants shown to be positive in Southern blot had higher MnSOD activity than untransformed control. Electric conductivity of leaf exudate was assayed after damage treatment with methyl viologen. The result suggested that the resistance of the transformed plants to oxidative damage was significantly higher than untransformed control."

"16622070","abstracttext","Delta-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) is synthesized in fungi by ALA synthase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of haem. The requirement for ALA synthase in Stagonospora nodorum to cause disease in wheat was investigated. The single gene encoding ALA synthase (Als1) was cloned and characterized. Expression analysis determined that Als1 transcription was up-regulated during germination and also towards the latter stages of the infection. The Als1 gene was further characterized by homologous gene replacement. The inactivation of Als1 resulted in strains producing severely stunted germ tubes leading quickly to death. The strains could be recovered by supplementation with 33 microM ALA. Pathogenicity assays revealed the als1 strains were essentially non-pathogenic, inferring a key role for the synthesis of ALA during in planta growth. Supplementing the strains with ALA restored growth in vitro and also pathogenicity for up to 5 days after inoculation. Further examination by inoculating the als1 strains onto wounded leaves found that pathogenicity was only partially restored, suggesting that host-derived in planta levels of ALA are not sufficient to support growth. This study has identified a key role for fungal ALA synthesis during infection and revealed its potential as an antifungal target."

"18944724","abstracttext","ABSTRACT The common wheat cultivar Thatcher and the backcross derivative Canthatch are moderately or fully susceptible to several races of stem rust because of a suppressor on chromosome 7DL that inhibits the expression of the relevant resistance gene(s). The incorporation of leaf rust resistance gene Lr34 into 'Thatcher' is known to enhance stem rust resistance. The effect of this gene in a 'Canthatch' background and its relationship with the 7DL suppressor were determined by replacing chromosome 7D of 'Canthatch' with 7D of 'Chinese Spring', which possesses Lr34 on the short arm. 'Canthatch' nullisomic 7D was crossed with 'Chinese Spring', followed by a succession of backcrosses to the nullisomic recurrent parent. Homozygous resistant disomic and monosomic substitution lines were recovered that exhibited the same resistant reaction as that of 'Thatcher' possessing Lr34 and as that of 'Canthatch' nullisomic 7D, in which the 7DL suppressor is absent. The results indicate that, in 'Canthatch', Lr34 permits expression of resistance genes normally inhibited by the 7DL suppressor. Furthermore, it is likely that, in 'Thatcher' and 'Thatcher' back-cross derivatives, Lr34 inactivates the 7DL suppressor."

"19093437","abstracttext","The study was carried out to investigate the nature of gene action determining the inheritance pattern of protein, lysine, gluten and flour yield in eight wheat varieties (Pak 81, Pothowar 93, Parwaz 94, Shahkar 95, Suleiman 96, Chakwal 97, Kohistan 97 and MH 97) selected on the basis of phenotypic diversity. In order to ascertain the gene action involved in the inheritance of these characters, the techniques like analysis of variance of Hayman model and genetic component analysis were employed. The estimates of components of genetic variation showed that additive genetic effects controlled the expression of traits like protein contents and flour yield, however, non-additive gene effects were more important for lysine contents and gluten contents. Directional dominance was observed in case of protein contents, which indicated the possibility of further improvement in this particular trait. Protein contents and flour yield being controlled by additive genetic effects with partial dominance suggested that selection could be practiced in early segregating generations for improvement in these traits."

"19070152","abstracttext","The contamination of mycotoxins associated with head blight of wheat and other grains caused by Fusarium graminearum is chronic threat to crop, human and animal health throughout the world. Deoxinevalenol (DON), produced by the fungus, belonging to class trichothecene is believed to act as a virulence factor in fungal pathogenesis by inhibiting eukaryotic protein synthesis, thereby blocking or delaying the expression of defense related proteins induced by host plant. The putative site of action of DON is 60s ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3). In order to reduce the effects of DON in the host plants, we modified tomato RPL3 (LeRPL3) to introduce W25R/H259Y mutations so that amino acid residue 258 is changed from tryptophan to arginine and 259 from histidine to tyrosine. Transgenic tobacco plants expressing these modified LeRPL3 cDNAs were tested for growth pattern of T1 seedlings in presence of DON. When seedling of these transgenic tobacco plants were compared for growth in the presence of DON, a significant difference in growth rate and the ability to undergo differentiation was observed among those plants expressing the modified version of the Rp13 gene, compared to those expressing the wild-type Rp13 gene. Expression of the tagged gene product indicates that is was not due to somaclonal variation. These results indicate a possible mechanism of host plant resistance to the fungal pathogen F. graminearum among the susceptible cereal species based on the expression ofmodified Rp13 genes."

"18986253","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum causes head blight (FHB) and crown rot (CR) diseases in wheat. Compared with FHB, CR symptom development occurs slowly, usually taking 4 to 8 weeks to become visible. To characterize CR development, we used histological and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses to assess fungal colonization during a timecourse of infection. Three distinct phases of infection were identified: i) initial spore germination with formation of a superficial hyphal mat at the inoculation point, ii) colonization of the adaxial epidermis of the outer leaf sheath and mycelial growth from the inoculation point to the crown, concomitant with a drop in fungal biomass, and iii) extensive colonization of the internal crown tissue. Fungal gene expression was examined during each phase using Affymetrix GeneChips. In total, 1,839 F. graminearum genes were significantly upregulated, including some known FHB virulence genes (e.g., TRI5 and TRI14), and 2,649 genes were significantly downregulated in planta compared with axenically cultured mycelia. Global comparisons of fungal gene expression with published data for FHB showed significant similarities between early stages of FHB and CR. These results indicate that CR disease development involves distinct phases of colonization, each of which is associated with a different fungal gene expression program."

"17508215","abstracttext","Two pathogenesis-related (PR) protein genes consisting of a barley chitinase (chi-2) and a wheat lipid-transfer-protein (ltp) were introduced singly and in combination into carrot plants via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation using the phosphinothricin acetyl transferase (bar) gene as a selectable marker. Over 75% of regenerated plants were confirmed to be positive for the transgenes by PCR and RT-PCR and were resistant to the herbicide Liberty (0.2%, v/v). Northern analysis and immunoblotting confirmed the expression of the transgenes in about 70% of the plants, with variable expression levels among individual lines. Southern analysis revealed from one to three copies of each transgene. Transgenic plants were inoculated with two necrotrophic foliar fungal pathogens, Alternaria radicicola and Botrytis cinerea, and showed significantly higher resistance when both PR genes were expressed compared to single-gene transformants. The level of disease reduction in plants expressing both genes was 95% for Botrytis and 90% for Alternaria infection compared to 40-50% for single-gene transformants. The chi2 and ltp genes could be deployed in combination in other crop plants to significantly enhance resistance to necrotrophic fungal pathogens."

Pantoea ananatis is reported as a common colonist of wheat heads at ripening and causes center rot of onion. In this study, we demonstrated that P. ananatis SK-1 produced two AHLs, N-hexanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL) and N-(3-oxohexanoyl)-l-homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C6-HSL). We cloned the AHL-synthase gene (eanI) and AHL-receptor gene (eanR) and revealed that the deduced amino acid sequence of EanI/EanR showed high identity to those of EsaI/EsaR from P. stewartii. EanR repressed the ean box sequence and the addition of AHLs resulted in derepression of ean box. Inactivation of the chromosomal eanI gene in SK-1 caused disruption of exopolysaccharide (EPS) biosynthesis, biofilm formation, and infection of onion leaves, which were recovered by adding exogenous 3-oxo-C6-HSL. These results demonstrated that the quorum-sensing system involved the biosynthesis of EPS, biofilm formation, and infection of onion leaves in P. ananatis SK-1."

"16667080","abstracttext","One of the most abundant proteins in maize (Zea mays L.) embryos is the molecular weight 63,000 globulin encoded by the Glb1 gene. To obtain DNA clones corresponding to Glb1, a cDNA library corresponding to RNA from developing maize embryos was constructed in a lambda expression vector and screened with antibodies specific for Glb1-encoded proteins. Here we report the complete nucleotide sequence, as determined from two overlapping clones, of pcGlb 1S, a 2009 base pair clone containing the entire translated region of Glb1. The deduced amino acid sequence of pcGlb 1S shows similarities to 7S-type seed storage proteins of wheat and legumes. Southern blot analysis of maize DNA confirms previous genetic studies which had indicated the presence of a single copy of Glb1 per haploid genome. Northern blot analysis indicates that Glb1 transcripts are present throughout most of embryo development and that expression of this gene is limited to seed tissues. Embryos homozygous for a Glb1 null allele, in which Glb1-encoded proteins are not detectable, contain low levels of Glb1 transcripts which are a different size from those encoded by functional alleles.

"20058039","abstracttext","We describe the sequence of a gene encoding a high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) expressed in the endosperm of the wheat relative Australopyrum retrofractum. Although the subunit has a similar primary structure to that HMW-GS genes present in other Triticeae species, its N-terminal domain is shorter, its central repetitive domain includes a unique dodecameric motif, and its C-terminal domain contain an extra cysteine residue. A phylogenetic analysis showed that the Glu-W1 gene is neither a true x- nor a true y-type subunit, although it is more closely related to the y-type genes present in the K and E genomes than to any other published HMW-GS gene. All these results indicated that this novel subunit may undergo a special evolutionary process different from other Triticeae species. A flour supplementation experiment showed that the Glu-W1 subunit has a negative effect on dough quality, which might be the result of interaction between the two closely placed cysteine residues in the C-terminal region."
"19913692","articletitle","Genetic variability and Fumonisin production by Fusarium proliferatum."
"19913692","abstracttext","Fusarium proliferatum is together with Fusarium verticillioides the main source of fumonisins, a health risk mycotoxin, contaminating agro-products. Contrary to F. verticillioides, it colonizes a wide range of host plants besides maize, such as wheat or barley among others, in particular in certain regions (Southern Europe). The phylogenetic study performed in this work using a wide sample of isolates from diverse hosts and origins revealed a high variability, while no host preferences could be sustained. A real time RT-PCR assay was also developed specific for F. proliferatum on the basis on fumonisin biosynthetic gene, FUM1, which allowed discrimination from F. verticillioides. FUM1 gene expression showed a high and significant correlation (0.77) with fumonisin production, representing a valuable tool for specific and sensitive diagnosis of metabolically active fumonisin-producing F. proliferatum isolates and for evaluating the influence on environmental conditions on FUM1 gene regulation. The ability to produce fumonisins was also widely distributed indicating that F. proliferatum can represent a risk for health similarly to F. verticillioides. Moreover, the wide range of plants susceptible to colonization by F. proliferatum suggests that the impact of fumonisin risk in a number of commodities might need a revision."
"20128702","articletitle","H-gene-mediated resistance to Hessian fly exhibits features of penetration resistance to fungi."
"20128702","abstracttext","Features shared by host-specific phytophagous insects and biotrophic plant pathogens include gene-for-gene interactions and the ability to induce susceptibility in plants. The Hessian fly shows both. To protect against Hessian fly, grasses have H genes. Avirulent larvae die on H-gene-containing resistant plants but the cause of death is not known. Imaging techniques were used to examine epidermal cells at larval attack sites, comparing four resistant wheat genotypes (H6, H9, H13, and H26) to a susceptible genotype. Present in both resistant and susceptible plants attacked by larvae were small holes in the tangential cell wall, with the size of the holes (0.1 microm in diameter) matching that of the larval mandible. Absent from attacked resistant plants were signs of induced susceptibility, including nutritive tissue and ruptured cell walls. Present in attacked resistant plants were signs of induced resistance, including cell death and fortification of the cell wall. Both presumably limit larval access to food, because the larva feeds on the leaf surface by sucking up liquids released from ruptured cells. Resistance was associated with several subcellular responses, including elaboration of the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi complex and associated vesicles. Similar responses are observed in plant resistance to fungi, suggesting that ""vesicle-associated penetration resistance"" also functions against insects."

"20532756","abstracttext","A xylanase gene xyn10A was isolated from the human gut bacterium Bacteroides xylanisolvens XB1A and the gene product was characterized. Xyn10A is a 40-kDa xylanase composed of a glycoside hydrolase family 10 catalytic domain with a signal peptide. A recombinant His-tagged Xyn10A was produced in Escherichia coli and purified. It was active on oat spelt and birchwood xylans and on wheat arabinoxylans. It cleaved xylotetraose, xylopentaose, and xylohexaose but not xylobiose, clearly indicating that Xyn10A is a xylanase. Surprisingly, it showed a low activity against carboxymethylcellulose but no activity at all against aryl-cellobioside and cellooligosaccharides. The enzyme exhibited K (m) and V (max) of 1.6 mg ml(-1) and 118 micromol min(-1) mg(-1) on oat spelt xylan, and its optimal temperature and pH for activity were 37 degrees C and pH 6.0, respectively. Its catalytic properties (k (cat)/K (m) = 3,300 ml mg(-1) min(-1)) suggested that Xyn10A is one of the most active GH10 xylanase described to date. Phylogenetic analyses showed that Xyn10A was closely related to other GH10 xylanases from human Bacteroides. The xyn10A gene was expressed in B. xylanisolvens XB1A cultured with glucose, xylose or xylans, and the protein was associated with the cells. Xyn10A is the first family 10 xylanase characterized from B. xylanisolvens XB1A."

"19888826","abstracttext","Traits contributing to the competence of biocontrol bacteria to colonize plant roots are often induced in the rhizosphere in response to plant components. These interactions have been studied using the two partners in gnotobiotic systems. However, in nature, beneficial or pathogenic fungi often colonize roots. Influence of these plant-fungus interactions on bacterial behavior remains to be investigated. Here, we have examined the influence of colonization of wheat roots by the take-all fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici on gene expression of the biocontrol bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf29Arp. Bacteria were inoculated onto healthy, early G. graminis var. tritici-colonized and necrotic roots and transcriptomes were compared by shotgun DNA microarray. Pf29Arp decreased disease severity when inoculated before the onset of necrosis. Necrotic roots exerted a broader effect on gene expression compared with early G. graminis var. tritici-colonized and healthy roots. A gene encoding a putative type VI secretion system effector was only induced in necrotic conditions. A common pool of Pf29Arp genes differentially expressed on G. graminis var. tritici-colonized roots was related to carbon metabolism and oxidative stress, with a highest fold-change with necrosis. Overall, the data showed that the association of the pathogenic fungus with the roots strongly altered Pf29Arp adaptation with differences between early and late G. graminis var. tritici infection steps."

"21615301","abstracttext","Segregating F(3) families, derived from a cross between oat cultivar Swan and the putative single gene line PC68, were used to determine the association of seed storage protein loci and resistance gene analogues (RGAs) with the crown rust resistance gene Pc68. SDS-PAGE analysis detected three avenin loci, AveX, AveY, and AveZ, closely linked to Pc68. Their diagnostic alleles are linked in coupling to Pc68 and were also detected in three additional lines carrying Pc68. Another protein locus was linked in repulsion to Pc68. In complementary studies, three wheat RGA clones (W2, W4, and W10) detected restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) between homozygous resistant and homozygous susceptible F(3) DNA bulks. Four oat homologues of W2 were cloned and sequenced. RFLPs detected with two of them were mapped using F(3) and F(4) populations. Clone 18 detected a locus, Orga2, linked in repulsion to Pc68. Clone 22 detected several RFLPs including Orga1 (the closest locus to Pc68) and three RGA loci (Orga22-2, Orga22-3, and Orga22-4) loosely linked to Pc68. The diagnostic RFLPs linked in coupling to Pc68 were detected by clone 22 in three additional oat lines carrying Pc68 and have potential utility in investigating and improving crown rust resistance of oat."

"21910639","abstracttext","Arthropod-resistant crops provide significant ecological and economic benefits to global agriculture. Incompatible interactions involving resistant plants and avirulent pest arthropods are mediated by constitutively produced and arthropod-induced plant proteins and defense allelochemicals synthesized by resistance gene products. Cloning and molecular mapping have identified the Mi-1.2 and Vat arthropod resistance genes as CC-NBS-LRR (coiled coil-nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat) subfamily NBS-LRR resistance proteins, as well as several resistance gene analogs. Genetic linkage mapping has identified more than 100 plant resistance gene loci and linked molecular markers used in cultivar development. Rice and sorghum arthropod-resistant cultivars and, to a lesser extent, raspberry and wheat cultivars are components of integrated pest management (IPM) programs in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. Nevertheless, arthropod resistance in most food and fiber crops has not been integrated due primarily to the application of synthetic insecticides. Plant and arthropod genomics provide many opportunities to more efficiently develop arthropod-resistant plants, but integration of resistant cultivars into IPM programs will succeed only through interdisciplinary collaboration."

"22711284","abstracttext","Brachypodium distachyon is a grass species that serves as a useful model for wheat and also for many of the grass species proposed as feedstocks for bioenergy production. Here, we monitored B. distachyon symbioses with five different arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and identified symbioses that vary functionally with respect to plant performance. Three symbioses promoted significant increases in shoot phosphorus (P) content and shoot growth of Brachypodium, while two associations were neutral. The Brachypodium/Glomus candidum symbiosis showed a classic 'Paris-type' morphology. In the other four AM symbioses, hyphal growth was exclusively intracellular and linear; hyphal coils were not observed and arbuscules were abundant. Expression of the Brachypodium ortholog of the symbiosis-specific phosphate (Pi) transporter MtPT4 did not differ significantly in these five interactions indicating that the lack of apparent functionality did not result from a failure to express this gene or several other AM symbiosis-associated genes. Analysis of the expression patterns of the complete PHT1 Pi transporter gene family and AMT2 gene family in B. distachyon/G. intraradices mycorrhizal roots identified additional family members induced during symbiosis and again, transcript levels were similar in the different Brachypodium AM symbioses. This initial morphological, molecular and functional characterization provides a framework for future studies of functional diversity in AM symbiosis in B. distachyon."
"23006139","articletitle","Effect of nitrogen and waterlogging on denitrifier gene abundance, community structure and activity in the rhizosphere of wheat."
"23006139","abstracttext","Microbial denitrification plays a key role in determining the availability of soil nitrogen (N) to plants. However, factors influencing the structure and function of denitrifier communities in the rhizosphere remain unclear. Waterlogging can result in root anoxia and increased denitrification, leading to significant N loss from soil and potential nitrous oxide (N(2)O) emissions. This study investigated denitrifier gene abundance, community structure and activity in the rhizosphere of wheat in response to anoxia and N limitation. Denitrifier community structure in the rhizosphere differed from that in bulk soil, and denitrifier gene copy numbers (nirS, nirK, nosZ) and potential denitrification activity were greater in the rhizosphere. Anoxia and N limitation, and in particular a combination of both, reduced the magnitude of this effect on gene abundance (in particular nirS) and activity, with N limitation having greater impact than waterlogging in rhizosphere soil, in contrast to bulk soil where the impact of waterlogging was greater. Increased N supply to anoxic plants improved plant health and increased rhizosphere soil pH, which resulted in enhanced reduction of N(2)O. Both anoxia and N limitation significantly influenced the structure and function of denitrifier communities in the rhizosphere, with reduced root-derived carbon postulated to play an important role."

"19506305","abstracttext","Unlike maize and wheat, where artificial selection is associated with an almost uniform increase in seed or grain size, domesticated rice exhibits dramatic phenotypic diversity for grain size and shape. Here we clone and characterize GS3, an evolutionarily important gene controlling grain size in rice. We show that GS3 is highly expressed in young panicles in both short- and long-grained varieties but is not expressed in leaves or panicles after flowering, and we use genetic transformation to demonstrate that the dominant allele for short grain complements the long-grain phenotype. An association study revealed that a C to A mutation in the second exon of GS3 (A allele) was associated with enhanced grain length in Oryza sativa but was absent from other Oryza species. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) was elevated and there was a 95.7% reduction in nucleotide diversity (theta(pi)) across the gene in accessions carrying the A allele, suggesting positive selection for long grain. Haplotype analysis traced the origin of the long-grain allele to a Japonica-like ancestor and demonstrated introgression into the Indica gene pool. This study indicates a critical role for GS3 in defining the seed morphologies of modern subpopulations of O. sativa and enhances the potential for genetic manipulation of grain size in rice."
"19404679","articletitle","Regions associated with repression of the barley (Hordeum vulgare) VERNALIZATION1 gene are not required for cold induction."
"19404679","abstracttext","Activity of the VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) gene is required for flowering in temperate cereals such as wheat and barley. In varieties that require prolonged exposure to cold to flower (vernalization), VRN1 is expressed at low levels and is induced by vernalization to trigger flowering. In other varieties, deletions or insertions in the first intron of the VRN1 gene are associated with increased VRN1 expression in the absence of cold treatment, reducing or eliminating the requirement for vernalization. To characterize natural variation in VRN1, the first intron of the barley (Hordeum vulgare) VRN1 gene (HvVRN1) was assayed for deletions or insertions in a collection of 1,000 barleys from diverse geographical regions. Ten alleles of HvVRN1 containing deletions or insertions in the first intron were identified, including three alleles that have not been described previously. Different HvVRN1 alleles were associated with differing levels of HvVRN1 expression in non-vernalized plants and with different flowering behaviour. Using overlapping deletions, we delineated regions in the HvVRN1 first intron that are associated with low levels of HvVRN1 expression in non-vernalized plants. Deletion of these intronic regions does not prevent induction of HvVRN1 by cold or the maintenance of increased HvVRN1 expression following cold treatment. We suggest that regions within the first intron of HvVRN1 are required to maintain low levels of HvVRN1 expression prior to winter but act independently of the regulatory mechanisms that mediate induction of HvVRN1 by cold during winter."

"19550041","abstracttext","Rice is the first cereal genome with a finished sequence and a model crop that has important syntenic relationships with other cereal species. The objectives of our study were to identify resistance gene analogue (RGA) sequences from chromosome 11 of rice, understand their expression in other cereals and dicots by in silico analysis, determine their presence on other rice chromosomes, and evaluate the extent of polymorphism and actual expression in a set of rice genotypes. A total of 195 RGAs were predicted and physically localised. Of these, 91.79% expressed in rice, and 51.28% expressed in wheat, which was the highest among other cereals. Among monocots, sugarcane showed the highest (78.92%) expression, while among dicots, RGAs were maximally expressed in Arabidopsis (11.79%). Interestingly, two of the chromosome 11-specific RGAs were found to be expressing in all the organisms studied. Eighty RGAs of chromosome 11 had significant homology with chromosome 12, which was the maximum among all the rice chromosomes. Thirty-one per cent of the RGAs used in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification showed polymorphism in a set of rice genotypes. Actual gene expression analysis revealed post-inoculation induction of one RGA in the rice line IRBB-4 carrying the bacterial blight resistance gene Xa-4. Our results have implications for the development of sequence-based markers and functional validation of specific RGAs in rice."
"19556707","articletitle","The spatial expression patterns of DROOPING LEAF orthologs suggest a conserved function in grasses."
"19556707","abstracttext","The DROOPING LEAF (DL) gene regulates carpel specification in the flower and midrib formation in the leaf in Oryza sativa (rice). Loss-of-function mutations in the dl locus cause homeotic transformation of carpels into stamens and lack of midrib, resulting in the drooping leaf phenotype. DL is a member of the YABBY gene family and is closely related to the CRABS CLAW (CRC) gene in Arabidopsis thaliana. The function of Arabidopsis CRC, however, differs from that of rice DL: it is responsible for nectary development and is partially involved in carpel identity. Thus, genes related to DL/CRC seem to have functionally diversified during angiosperm evolution. To assess the conservation of DL function in related species, here we examined the in situ expression patterns of DL orthologs in three grass species, i.e., maize, wheat and sorghum, which is assigned to subfamilies different from Ehrhartoideae including O. sativa. The results clearly show that the temporal and spatial expression patterns of DL orthologs in the three species are identical to those of rice DL in both flower and leaf development, suggesting that DL-related genes are functionally conserved within the grass family. It is likely that DL may have been recruited to carpel specification and midrib formation within the lineage of the grass family after divergence of their ancestor from that of eudicots."

It produces the antibiotic 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol and aggressively colonizes the roots of cereal crops. In this study, we analyzed the genome of Q8r1-96 and identified a type III protein secretion system (T3SS) gene cluster that has overall organization similar to that of the T3SS gene cluster of the plant pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. We also screened a collection of 30 closely related P. fluorescens strains and detected the T3SS genes in all but one of them. The Q8r1-96 genome contained ropAA and ropM type III effector genes, which are orthologs of the P. syringae effector genes hopAA1-1 and hopM1, as well as a novel type III effector gene designated ropB. These type III effector genes encoded proteins that were secreted in culture and injected into plant cells by both P. syringae and Q8r1-96 T3SSs. The Q8r1-96 T3SS was expressed in the rhizosphere, but mutants lacking a functional T3SS were not altered in their rhizosphere competence. The Q8r1-96 type III effectors RopAA, RopB, and RopM were capable of suppressing the hypersensitive response and production of reactive oxygen species, two plant immune responses."

Four independent MCC1 knock-out mutants were generated via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. All of the MCC1 mutants showed consistent multiple phenotypes. Significant reductions in radial growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA) were observed in all of the MCC1 mutants. In addition, MCC1 gene-deletion mutants produced less aerial mycelium on PDA, showed delayed filamentous growth, had unusual hyphal swellings, produced more melanin, showed an increase in their stress tolerance response, and were reduced significantly in pathogenicity. These results indicate that the MCC1 gene is involved in multiple signaling pathways, including those involved in pathogenicity in M. graminicola."

"21172814","abstracttext","Members of the glutamine synthetase (GS) gene family have now been characterized in many crop species such as wheat, rice, and maize. Studies have shown that cytosolic GS isoforms are involved in nitrogen remobilization during leaf senescence and emphasized a role in seed production particularly in small grain crop species. Data from the sequencing of genomes for model crops and expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries from non-model species have strengthened the idea that the cytosolic GS genes are organized in three functionally and phylogenetically conserved subfamilies. Using a bioinformatic approach, the considerable publicly available information on high throughput gene expression was mined to search for genes having patterns of expression similar to GS. Interesting new hypotheses have emerged from searching for co-expressed genes across multiple unfiltered experimental data sets in rice. This approach should inform new experimental designs and studies to explore the regulation of the GS gene family further. It is expected that understanding the regulation of GS under varied climatic conditions will emerge as an important new area considering the results from recent studies that have shown nitrogen assimilation to be critical to plant acclimation to high CO(2) concentrations."
"21265997","articletitle","Temporal and spatial control of transgene expression using a heat-inducible promoter in transgenic wheat."
"21265997","abstracttext","Constitutive promoters are widely used to functionally characterise plant genes in transgenic plants, but their lack of specificity and poor control over protein expression can be a major disadvantage. On the other hand, promoters that provide precise regulation of temporal or spatial transgene expression facilitate such studies by targeting over-expression or knockdown of target genes to specific tissues and/or at particular developmental stages. Here, we used the uidA (beta-glucuronidase, GUS) reporter gene to demonstrate that the barley Hvhsp17 gene promoter can be induced by heat treatment of 38-40 °C for 1-2 h in transgenic wheat. The GUS enzyme was expressed only in those tissues directly exposed to heat and not in neighbouring leaf tissues. The induction of HSP::GUS was demonstrated in all organs and tissues tested, but expression in older tissues was lower. Generally, proximal root sections showed less GUS activity than in root tips. This heat-inducible promoter provides the ability to investigate the function of candidate genes by overexpression or by down-regulation of target gene expression (for example by RNAi) in selected tissues or developmental stages of a transgenic plant, limited only by the ability to apply a heat shock to the selected tissues. It also allows the investigation of genes that would be lethal or reduce fertility if expressed constitutively."

"21531826","abstracttext","Pseudomonas fluorescens are rhizobacteria known for their biocontrol properties. Several antimicrobial functions are crucial for this process, and the experiments described here investigate the modulation of their expression during the plant-bacterium interaction. The role of a LuxR family regulator in interkingdom signaling has been investigated using genome-scale transcriptome analysis, gene promoter studies in vivo and in vitro, biocontrol assays, and response to plant compounds. PsoR, a LuxR solo or orphan regulator of P. fluorescens, was identified. PsoR is solubilized and activates a lux-box-containing promoter only in the presence of macerated plants, suggesting the presence of a plant molecule(s) that most likely binds to PsoR. Gene expression profiles revealed that genes involved in the inhibition of plant pathogens were affected by PsoR, including a chitinase gene, iron metabolism genes, and biosynthetic genes of antifungal compounds. 2,4-Diacetylphloroglucinol production is PsoR dependent both in vitro and in vivo. psoR mutants were significantly reduced for their ability to protect wheat plants from root rot, and damping-off caused by Pythium ultimum infection. PsoR most likely senses a molecule(s) in the plant and modulates expression of genes that have a role in biocontrol. PsoR and related proteins form a subfamily of LuxR family regulators in plant-associated bacteria."

"21397712","abstracttext","The ortholog of the human gene NPC1 was identified in the plant pathogenic, filamentous fungus Fusarium graminearum by shared amino acid sequence, protein domain structure and cellular localization of the mature fungal protein. The FusariumNpc1 gene shares 34% amino acid sequence identity and 51% similarity to the human gene, has similar domain structure and is constitutively expressed, although up-regulated in ungerminated macroconidia and ascospores. GFP-tagged Npc1p localizes to the fungal vacuolar membrane. Cultures derived from a Δnpc1 mutant strain contain significantly more ergosterol than cultures of the wildtype. Staining with the fluorescent, sterol binding dye filipin, shows that ergosterol accumulates in vacuoles of the Δnpc1 mutant but not the wildtype strain. The Δnpc1 mutant has a temperature dependent reduction in growth and greater sensitivity to the ergosterol synthesis inhibiting fungicide tebuconazole compared with the wildtype strain or the mutant complemented with wildtype Npc1. The mutant also is significantly reduced in pathogenicity to wheat. Our results are consistent with the interpretation that Npc1p is important for normal transport of ergosterol from the vacuole and is essential for proper membrane function under particular environmental conditions."

"23296492","abstracttext","The discovery of several new loci for resistance to Hessian fly was reported here. QHf.uga-6AL, the late HR61 was recognized from wheat cultivar 26R61 on the distal end of 6AL with resistance to both biotypes E and vH13. It is the first gene or QTL found on this particular chromosome. QHf.uga-3DL and QHf.uga-1AL, physically assigned to the deletion bins 3DL2-0.27-0.81 and 1AL1-0.17-0.61, respectively, were detected for resistance to biotype vH13. Both QTL should represent new loci for Hessian fly resistance and the latter was detectable only in the late seedling stage when tolerance was evident. In addition, QHf.uga-6DS-C and QHf.uga-1AS had minor effect and were identified from the susceptible parent AGS 2000 for resistance to biotype E and vH13, respectively. QHf.uga-6DS-C is different from the known gene H13 on 6DS and QHf.uga-1AS is different from H9 gene cluster on 1AS. These loci also might be new components of Hessian fly resistance, although their LOD values were not highly significant. The QTL detections were all conducted on a RIL mapping population of 26R61/AGS 2000 with good genome coverage of molecular markers. The strategy used in the current study will serve as a good starting point for the discovery and mapping of resistance genes including tolerance to the pest and the closely linked markers will certainly be useful in selecting or pyramiding of these loci in breeding programs."

"23396262","abstracttext","Phomenoic acid, a long chain aliphatic carboxylic acid is a major metabolite produced by Leptosphaeria maculans, a fungal pathogen of Brassica napus (canola). This fungus has 15 predicted polyketide synthases (PKS) and seven of them have the appropriate domains for the biosynthesis of phomenoic acid. The most highly expressed PKS gene after 7 days growth in 10% V8 juice, PKS2, was silenced and the resultant mutant produced very low levels of phomenoic acid, indicating that this PKS is involved in phomenoic acid biosynthesis. This gene is part of a co-regulated cluster of genes. Reduced expression of an adjacent gene encoding the transcriptional regulator C6TF, led to reduced expression of genes for PKS2, P450, a cytochrome P450 monoxygenase, YogA, an alcohol dehydrogenase/quinone reductase, RTA1, a lipid transport exporter superfamily member and MFS, a Major Facilitator Superfamily transporter, as well as a marked reduction in phomenoic acid production. Phomenoic acid is toxic towards another canola pathogen Leptosphaeria biglobosa 'canadensis', but not towards L. maculans and only moderately toxic towards the wheat pathogen Stagonospora nodorum. This molecule is detected in infected stems and stubble of B. napus, but biosynthesis of it does not appear to be essential for pathogenicity of L. maculans. Phomenoic acid may play a role in allowing L. maculans to outcompete other fungi in its environmental niche."
"23864619","articletitle","The HEX1 gene of Fusarium graminearum is required for fungal asexual reproduction and pathogenesis and for efficient viral RNA accumulation of Fusarium graminearum virus 1."
"23864619","abstracttext","The accumulation of viral RNA depends on many host cellular factors. The hexagonal peroxisome (Hex1) protein is a fungal protein that is highly expressed when the DK21 strain of Fusarium graminearum virus 1 (FgV1) infects its host, and Hex1 affects the accumulation of FgV1 RNA. The Hex1 protein is the major constituent of the Woronin body (WB), which is a peroxisome-derived electron-dense core organelle that seals the septal pore in response to hyphal wounding. To clarify the role of Hex1 and the WB in the relationship between FgV1 and Fusarium graminearum, we generated targeted gene deletion and overexpression mutants. Although neither HEX1 gene deletion nor overexpression substantially affected vegetative growth, both changes reduced the production of asexual spores and reduced virulence on wheat spikelets in the absence of FgV1 infection. However, the vegetative growth of deletion and overexpression mutants was increased and decreased, respectively, upon FgV1 infection compared to that of an FgV1-infected wild-type isolate. Viral RNA accumulation was significantly decreased in deletion mutants but was significantly increased in overexpression mutants compared to the viral RNA accumulation in the virus-infected wild-type control. Overall, these data indicate that the HEX1 gene plays a direct role in the asexual reproduction and virulence of F. graminearum and facilitates viral RNA accumulation in the FgV1-infected host fungus."

"24124688","abstracttext","Seven ab initio web-based gene prediction programs (i.e., AUGUSTUS, BGF, Fgenesh, Fgenesh+, GeneID, Genemark.hmm, and HMMgene) were assessed to compare their prediction accuracy using protein-coding sequences of bread wheat. At both nucleotide and exon levels, Fgenesh+ was deduced as the superior program and BGF followed by Fgenesh were resided in the next positions, respectively. Conversely, at gene level, Fgenesh with the value of predicting more than 75% of all the genes precisely, concluded as the best ones. It was also found out that programs such as Fgenesh+, BGF, and Fgenesh, because of harboring the highest percentage of correct predictive exons appear to be much more applicable in achieving more trustworthy results, while using both GeneID and HMMgene the percentage of false negatives would be expected to enhance. Regarding initial exon, overall, the frequency of accurate recognition of 3' boundary was significantly higher than that of 5' and the reverse was true if terminal exon is taken into account. Lastly, HMMgene and Genemark.hmm, overall, presented independent tendency against GC content, while the others appear to be slightly more sensitive if GC-poor sequences are employed. Our results, overall, exhibited that to make adequate opportunity in acquiring remarkable results, gene finders still need additional improvements."

"24043611","abstracttext","The barley hordoindoline genes (Hina and Hinb) are homologous to the wheat puroindoline genes (Pina and Pinb). These genes are involved in grain hardness, which is an important quality for barley processing. We identified novel variants of Hina and Hinb in 10 wild Hordeum species (H. bogdanii, H. brachyantherum, H. bulbosum, H. chilense, H. comosum, H. marinum, H. murinum, H. patagonicum, H. pusillum, and H. roshevitzii) covering all Hordeum genomes and preliminarily named them Hinc. These nucleotide sequences were highly similar to those of Puroindoline b-2 variant genes (Pinb-2v) and were located on chromosome 7I in H. chilense. The Hinc genes in H. bogdanii, H. bulbosum, H. patagonicum, and H. roshevitzii were pseudogenes possessing in-frame stop codons. We also found a partial Hinc sequence in H. murinum. This gene was not found in cultivated barley and H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum. The phylogenetic tree of Gsp-1, Hin, and Pin genes demonstrates that Hinc and Pinb-2v genes formed one cluster. Therefore, we considered that Hinc and Pinb-2v genes shared a common ancestral gene and were homologous to each other. We also studied the evolutional process of Gsp-1, Hin, and Pin genes. Our results suggested that Gsp-1 might be the most closely related to a putative ancestral gene on Ha locus."

"24201962","abstracttext","Gene transfer into intact cells was achieved by electroporating zygotic wheat embryos without any special pretreatment. Electroporation was tissue specific in so far as scutellum cells were found to be much more susceptible to gene transfer than other cell types of the embryo. The orientation of the embryos in the electroporation chamber also influenced the number of transformed scutellum cells; during electroporation, as in electrophoresis, the negatively charged plasmid DNA molecules seemed to move towards the positive electrode. Therefore, the embryos were arranged so that the scutella faced the negative electrode. The use of plasmids carrying either two chimeric anthocyanin regulatory genes or a chimeric gusA gene allowed clear identification of transformed cells in the scutellum. On some of the embryos, more than 100 transformed scutellum cells were found after electroporation with single electric pulses of 275 V/cm discharged from a 960-μF capacitor and with 100 μg DNA/ml electroporation buffer. Using the anthocyanin marker system, visibly transformed cells grew to produce red sectors."

We investigated the nonhost response of barley to an isolate of the Magnaporthe species complex which is pathogenic on Pennisetum spp. as a potential source for novel resistance traits."
"24423145","abstracttext_results","Array experiments identified a barley gene encoding a putative cytochrome P450 monooxygenase whose transcripts accumulate to a higher concentration in the nonhost as compared to the host interaction. The gene clusters within the CYP96 clade of the P450 plant gene family and is designated as CYP96B22. Expression of CYP96B22 was triggered during the ectoparasitic growth of the pathogen on the outside of the leaf. Usage of a fungicidal treatment and a Magnaporthe mutant confirmed that penetration was not necessary for this early activation of CYP96B22. Transcriptional silencing of CYP96B22 using Barley stripe mosaic virus led to a decrease in penetration resistance of barley plants to Magnaporthe host and nonhost isolates. This phenotype seems to be specific for the barley-Magnaporthe interaction, since penetration of the adapted barley powdery mildew fungus was not altered in similarly treated plants."
"24423145","abstracttext_conclusion","Taken together our results suggest a cross-talk between barley and Magnaporthe isolates across the plant surface. Since members of the plant CYP96 family are known to be involved in synthesis of epicuticular waxes, these substances or their derivatives might act as signal components. We propose a functional overlap of CYP96B22 in the execution of penetration resistance during basal and nonhost resistance of barley against different Magnaporthe species."

"24246669","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA), H2O2 and nitric oxide (NO) are important signals in gene expression and physiological responses during plant adaptation to environmental stresses. The essential role of NR-derived NO production in ABA and H2O2 induced antioxidant enzymes were studied using transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing Stylosanthes guianensis 9-cis-epoxycartenoid dioxygenase gene (SgNCED1) for elevated ABA level, or over-expressing wheat oxalate oxidase gene (OxO) for elevated H2O2 level in comparison to the wild type. Compared to the wild type, higher levels of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and nitrate reductase (NR) activities and NO production were observed in all transgenic plants. For investigating the relationship of ABA, H2O2, and NR-produced NO in the induction of antioxidant enzyme activities, an inhibitor of ABA biosynthesis, scavengers of H2O2 and NO, and an inhibitor of NR were used in the experiments. The results indicate that H2O2-induced activities of SOD, CAT, and APX depends on NR-derived NO in OxO transgenic plants, while ABA-induced activities depends on H2O2 and NR-derived NO in SgNCED1 transgenic plants. Compared to unaltered nitrate reductase 2 (NIA2), NIA1 transcript was induced in both types of transgenic plants. It is suggested NR-derived NO is essential for ABA- or H2O2-induced antioxidant enzyme activities."

"24248090","abstracttext","The gene encoding α-L-arabinofuranosidase (AFase) from Paenibacillus sp. DG-22 was cloned, sequenced, and expressed in Escherichia coli. The AFase gene (abfA) comprises a 1,509 bp open reading frame encoding 502 amino acids with a molecular mass of 56,520 daltons. The deduced amino acid sequence of the gene shows that AbfA is an enzyme consisting of only a catalytic domain, and that the enzyme has significant similarity to AFases classified into the family 51 of the glycosyl hydrolases. abfA was subcloned into the pQE60 expression vector to fuse it with a six-histidine tag and the recombinant AFase (rAbfA) was purified to homogeneity. The specific activity of the recombinant enzyme was 96.7 U/mg protein. Determination of the apparent molecular mass by gel-filtration chromatography indicated that AbfA has a tetrameric structure. The optimal pH and temperature of the enzyme were 6.0 and 60°C, respectively. The enzyme activity was completely inhibited by 1 mM HgCl2. rAbfA was active only towards p-nitrophephenyl α-L-arabinofuranoside and exhibited Km and Vmax values of 3.5 mM and 306.1 U/mg, respectively. rAbfA showed a synergistic effect in combination with endoxylanase on the degradation of oat spelt xylan and wheat arabinoxylan."

"24254167","abstracttext","By homogenizing rice leaves in liquid nitrogen, it was possible to isolate intact chloroplasts and, subsequently, pure rice chloroplast DNA from the purified chloroplasts. The DNA was digested by several restriction enzymes and fragments were fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The sum of the fragment sizes generated by the restriction enzymes showed that the total length of the DNA is 130 kb. A circular physical map of fragments, generated by digestion with SalI, PstI, and PvuII, has been constructed. The circular DNA contains two inverted repeats of about 20 kb separated by a large, single copy region of about 75 kb and a short, single copy region of about 15 kb. The location of the gene for the large subunit of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Fraction I protein) and the 32 KD photosystem II reaction center gene were determined by using as probes tobacco chloroplast DNAs containing these genes. Rice chloroplast DNA differs from chloroplast DNAs of wheat and corn as well as from dicot chloroplast DNAs by having the 32 KD gene located 20 kb removed from the end of an inverted repeat instead of close to the end, as in other plants."

"26400285","abstracttext","The use of appropriate reference genes is essential for the generation of accurate and biologically meaningful results from quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis. However, studies have found that the expression of most commonly used reference genes is not always independent of the tissues, treatments, or developmental stages studied. geNormPlus, NormFinder, and BestKeeper, were applied and the expression stability of nine candidate genes was evaluated in different data sets during wheat grain development. Varying degrees of diversity in either single or multiple reference genes were observed among the results generated from the different computer programs, parameters, and data sets. Therefore, the reliability of identified reference genes in the flag leaf and the complete set of samples was estimated by monitoring the expression dynamics of three NAM genes (TaNAM-A1, TaNAM-B1, and TaNAM-B2). The results suggest that a single control gene identified by geNormPlus for use with the complete set of samples, and multiple reference genes selected by geNormPlus and NormFinder exclusively for the flag leaf outperformed others owing to the consistent results with previous analyses of these genes, which were normalized against a verified single control gene. Given the limit of NormFinder in gene numbers of multiple reference genes, robust quantification can be achieved by normalizing against Ta27922 or multiple reference genes chosen by geNormPlus for individual tissues."
"25090999","articletitle","Doubling down on genomes: polyploidy and crop plants."
"25090999","abstracttext","Polyploidy, or whole genome multiplication, is ubiquitous among angiosperms. Many crop species are relatively recent allopolyploids, resulting from interspecific hybridization and polyploidy. Thus, an appreciation of the evolutionary consequences of (allo)polyploidy is central to our understanding of crop plant domestication, agricultural improvement, and the evolution of angiosperms in general. Indeed, many recent insights into plant biology have been gleaned from polyploid crops, including, but not limited to wheat, tobacco, sugarcane, apple, and cotton. A multitude of evolutionary processes affect polyploid genomes, including rapid and substantial genome reorganization, transgressive gene expression alterations, gene fractionation, gene conversion, genome downsizing, and sub- and neofunctionalization of duplicate genes. Often these genomic changes are accompanied by heterosis, robustness, and the improvement of crop yield, relative to closely related diploids. Historically, however, the genome-wide analysis of polyploid crops has lagged behind those of diploid crops and other model organisms. This lag is partly due to the difficulties in genome assembly, resulting from the genomic complexities induced by combining two or more evolutionarily diverged genomes into a single nucleus and by the significant size of polyploid genomes. In this review, we explore the role of polyploidy in angiosperm evolution, the domestication process and crop improvement. We focus on the potential of modern technologies, particularly next-generation sequencing, to inform us on the patterns and processes governing polyploid crop improvement and phenotypic change subsequent to domestication."

"25232936","abstracttext","Targeted genome editing nucleases, such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), are powerful tools for understanding gene function and for developing valuable new traits in plants. The clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas system has recently emerged as an alternative nuclease-based method for efficient and versatile genome engineering. In this system, only the 20-nt targeting sequence within the single-guide RNA (sgRNA) needs to be changed to target different genes. The simplicity of the cloning strategy and the few limitations on potential target sites make the CRISPR/Cas system very appealing. Here we describe a stepwise protocol for the selection of target sites, as well as the design, construction, verification and use of sgRNAs for sequence-specific CRISPR/Cas-mediated mutagenesis and gene targeting in rice and wheat. The CRISPR/Cas system provides a straightforward method for rapid gene targeting within 1-2 weeks in protoplasts, and mutated rice plants can be generated within 13-17 weeks."

"25222556","abstracttext","The vacuolar type H+-ATPase (V-type H+-ATPase) plays important roles in establishing an electrochemical H+-gradient across tonoplast, energizing Na+ sequestration into the central vacuole, and enhancing salt stress tolerance in plants. In this paper, a putative E subunit of the V-type H+-ATPase gene, W36 was isolated from stress-induced wheat de novo transcriptome sequencing combining with 5'-RACE and RT-PCR methods. The full-length of W36 gene was 1097 bp, which contained a 681 bp open reading frame (ORF) and encoded 227 amino acids. Southern blot analysis indicated that W36 was a single-copy gene. The quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that the expression level of W36 could be upregulated by drought, cold, salt, and exogenous ABA treatment. A subcellular localization assay showed that the W36 protein accumulated in the cytoplasm. Isolation of the W36 promoter revealed some cis-acting elements responding to abiotic stresses. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing W36 were enhanced salt and mannitol tolerance. These results indicate that W36 is involved in the plant response to osmotic stress."

"25204629","abstracttext","Arabidopsis END1-LIKE (AtEND1) was identified as a homolog of the barley endosperm-specific gene END1 and provides a model for the study of this class of genes and their products. The END1 is expressed in the endosperm transfer cells (ETC) of grasses. The ETC are responsible for transfer of nutrients from maternal tissues to the developing endosperm. Identification of several ETC-specific genes encoding lipid transfer proteins (LTP), including the END1, provided excellent markers for identification of ETC during seed development. To understand how AtEND1 forms complexes with lipid molecules, a three-dimensional (3D) molecular model was generated and reconciled with AtEND1 function. The spatial and temporal expression patterns of AtEND1 were examined in transgenic Arabidopsis plants transformed with an AtEND1 promoter-GUS fusion construct. The AtEND1 promoter was found to be seed and pollen specific. In contrast to ETC-specific expression of homologous genes in wheat and barley, expression of AtEND1 is less specific. It was observed in ovules and a few gametophytic tissues. A series of AtEND1 promoter deletions fused to coding sequence (CDS) of the uidA were transformed in Arabidopsis and the promoter region responsible for AtEND1 expression was identified. A 163 bp fragment of the promoter was found to be sufficient for both spatial and temporal patterns of expression reflecting that of AtEND1. Our data suggest that AtEND1 could be used as a marker gene for gametophytic tissues and developing endosperm. The role of the gene is unclear but it may be involved in fertilization and/or endosperm cellularization."

"25644697","abstracttext","Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) technology has been utilized widely for targeted gene mutagenesis, especially for gene inactivation, in many organisms, including agriculturally important plants such as rice, wheat, tomato and barley. This report describes application of this technology to generate heritable genome modifications in maize. TALENs were employed to generate stable, heritable mutations at the maize glossy2 (gl2) locus. Transgenic lines containing mono- or di-allelic mutations were obtained from the maize genotype Hi-II at a frequency of about 10% (nine mutated events in 91 transgenic events). In addition, three of the novel alleles were tested for function in progeny seedlings, where they were able to confer the glossy phenotype. In a majority of the events, the integrated TALEN T-DNA segregated independently from the new loss of function alleles, producing mutated null-segregant progeny in T1 generation. Our results demonstrate that TALENs are an effective tool for genome mutagenesis in maize, empowering the discovery of gene function and the development of trait improvement."

"25880330","abstracttext_background","Standard molecular biological methods involve the analysis of gene expression in living organisms under diverse environmental and developmental conditions. One of the most direct approaches to quantify gene expression is the isolation of RNA. Most techniques used to quantify gene expression require the isolation of RNA, usually from a large number of samples.

"25525452","abstracttext","Plant systems are useful research tools to address basic questions in homeopathy as they make it possible to overcome some of the drawbacks encountered in clinical trials (placebo effect, ethical issues, duration of the experiment, and high costs). The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis whether 7-day-old wheat seedlings, grown from seeds either poisoned with a sublethal dose of As2O3 or unpoisoned, showed different significant gene expression profiles after the application of ultrahigh diluted As2O3 (beyond Avogadro's limit) compared to water (control). The results provided evidence for a strong gene modulating effect of ultrahigh diluted As2O3 in seedlings grown from poisoned seeds: a massive reduction of gene expression levels to values comparable to those of the control group was observed for several functional classes of genes. A plausible hypothesis is that ultrahigh diluted As2O3 treatment induced a reequilibration of those genes that were upregulated during the oxidative stress by bringing the expression levels closer to the basal levels normally occurring in the control plants."

"26931632","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is an important pathogen of wheat and barley. In addition to severe yield losses, infested grains are often contaminated with harmful mycotoxins. In this study, we characterized the functions of FgSSN3 kinase gene in different developmental and infection processes and gene regulation in F. graminearum. The FgSSN3 deletion mutant had a nutrient-dependent growth defects and abnormal conidium morphology. It was significantly reduced in DON production, TRI gene expression, and virulence. Deletion of FgSSN3 also resulted in up-regulation of HTF1 and PCS1 expression in juvenile cultures, and repression of TRI genes in DON-producing cultures. In addition, Fgssn3 was female sterile and defective in hypopodium formation and infectious growth. RNA-seq analysis showed that FgSsn3 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a wide variety genes acting as either a repressor or activator. FgSsn3 physically interacted with C-type cyclin Cid1 and the cid1 mutant had similar phenotypes with Fgssn3, indicating that FgSsn3 and Cid1 form the CDK-cyclin pair as a component of the mediator complex in F. graminearum. Taken together, our results indicate that FgSSN3 is important for secondary metabolism, sexual reproduction, and plant infection, as a subunit of mediator complex contributing to transcriptional regulation of diverse genes."

"27327577","abstracttext","A new powdery mildew resistance gene designated as PmHo was identified in 'Mv Hombár' winter wheat, bred in Martonvásár, Hungary. It has exhibited a high level of resistance over the last two decades. Genetic mapping of recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross 'Ukrainka'/Mv Hombár located this gene on chromosome 2AL. The segregation ratio and consistent effect in all environments indicated that PmHo is a major dominant powdery mildew resistance gene. The race-specific nature of resistance in Mv Hombár was shown by the emergence of a single virulent pathotype designated as 51-Ho. This pathotype was, to some extent, able to infect Mv Hombár, developing visible symptoms with sporulating colonies. Microscopic studies revealed that, in incompatible interactions, posthaustorial hypersensitivity reaction was the most prevalent but not exclusive plant defense response in Mv Hombár, and fungal growth was mostly arrested during haustorium formation or in the early stages of colony development. The delayed fungal development of the virulent pathotype 51-Ho may be explained by additional effects of other loci that were also involved in the powdery mildew resistance of Mv Hombár."

Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the two strains coincided with those of the genus Streptomyces. The 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that the two isolates exhibited 99.6 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with each other and that they were most closely related to Streptomyces violaceorectus DSM 40279 T (98.8, 99.0 %). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that the two strains clustered together and formed a separate subclade. Furthermore, a combination of DNA-DNA hybridization results and some physiological and biochemical properties demonstrated that the two strains could be distinguished from its closest relative. Therefore, it is proposed that strains NEAU-A4 T and NEAU-A3 should be classified as representatives of a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomycestritici sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is NEAU-A4 T (=CGMCC 4.7393 T =DSM 104540 T )."

"29146152","abstracttext","Agricultural crops suffer many diseases, including fungal and bacterial infections, causing significant yield losses. The identification and characterisation of pathogenesis-related protein genes, such as chitinases, can lead to reduction in pathogen growth, thereby increasing tolerance against fungal pathogens. In the present study, the chitinase I gene was isolated from the genomic DNA of Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivar, Haider-93. The isolated DNA was used as template for the amplification of the ∼935bp full-length chitinase I gene. Based on the sequence of the amplified gene fragment, class I barley chitinase shares 93% amino acid sequence homology with class II wheat chitinase. Interestingly, barley class I chitinase and class II chitinase do not share sequence homology. Furthermore, the amplified fragment was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta strain under the control of T7 promoter in pET 30a vector. Recombinant chitinase protein of 35kDa exhibited highest expression at 0.5mM concentration of IPTG. Expressed recombinant protein of 35kDa was purified to homogeneity with affinity chromatography. Following purification, a Western blot assay for recombinant chitinase protein measuring 35kDa was developed with His-tag specific antibodies. The purified recombinant chitinase protein was demonstrated to inhibit significantly the important phytopathogenic fungi Alternaria solani, Fusarium spp, Rhizoctonia solani and Verticillium dahliae compared to the control at concentrations of 80μg and 200μg."

"28805296","abstracttext","Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CaMKs) are Ser/Thr protein kinases (PKs) that respond to changes in cytosolic free Ca 2+ and play diverse roles in eukaryotes. In fungi, CAMKs are generally classified into four families CAMK1, CAMKL, RAD53 and CAMK-Unique. Among these, CAMKL constitutes the largest family. In some fungal plant pathogens, members of the CaMKL family have been shown to be responsible for pathogenesis. However, little is known about their role(s) in rust fungi. In this study, we functionally characterized a novel PK gene, PsCaMKL1, from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). PsCaMKL1 belongs to a group of PKs that is evolutionarily specific to basidiomyceteous fungi. PsCaMKL1 shows little intra-species polymorphism between Pst isolates. PsCaMKL1 transcripts are highly elevated at early infection stages, whereas gene expression is downregulated in barely germinated urediospores under KN93 treatment. Overexpression of PsCaMKL1 in fission yeast increased resistance to environmental stresses. Knock down of PsCaMKL1 using host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) reduced the virulence of Pst accompanied by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and a hypersensitive response. These results suggest that PsCaMKL1 is a novel pathogenicity factor that exerts it virulence function by regulating ROS production in wheat."

"28554470","abstracttext","To adapt to cold conditions, barley plants rely on specific mechanisms, which have not been fully understood. In this study, we characterized a novel barley cold-induced gene identified using a PCR-based high coverage gene expression profiling method. The identified gene encodes a small protein that we named CISP1 (Cold-induced Small Protein 1). Homology searches of sequence databases revealed that CISP1 homologs (CISP2 and CISP3) exist in barley genome. Further database analyses showed that the CISP1 homologs were widely distributed in cold-tolerant plants such as wheat and rye. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analyses indicated that the expression of barley CISP genes was markedly increased in roots exposed to cold conditions. In situ hybridization analyses showed that the CISP1 transcripts were localized in the root tip and lateral root primordium. We also demonstrated that the CISP1 protein bound to RNA. Taken together, these findings indicate that CISP1 and its homologs encoding small RNA-binding proteins may serve as RNA chaperones playing a vital role in the cold adaptation of barley root. This is the first report describing the likely close relationship between root-specific genes and the cold adaptation process, as well as the potential function of the identified genes."

"28419168","abstracttext","Inflorescence development in cereals, including such important crops as rice, maize, and wheat, directly affects grain number and size and is a key determinant of yield. Cytokinin regulates meristem size and activity and, as a result, has profound effects on inflorescence development and architecture. To clarify the role of cytokinin action in inflorescence development, we used the NanoString nCounter system to analyze gene expression in the early stages of rice panicle development, focusing on 67 genes involved in cytokinin biosynthesis, degradation, and signaling. Results point toward key members of these gene families involved in panicle development and indicate that the expression of many genes involved in cytokinin action differs between the panicle and vegetative tissues. Dynamic patterns of gene expression suggest that subnetworks mediate cytokinin action during different stages of panicle development. The variation of expression during panicle development is greater among genes encoding proteins involved in cytokinin metabolism and negative regulators of the pathway than for the genes in the primary response pathway. These results provide insight into the expression patterns of genes involved in cytokinin action during inflorescence development in a crop of agricultural importance, with relevance to similar processes in other monocots. The identification of subnetworks of genes expressed at different stages of early panicle development suggests that manipulation of their expression could have substantial effects on inflorescence architecture."

"28591592","abstracttext","Codon adaptation index (CAI) of a 1263bp long endoglucanase encoding gene from the thermophilic mould Myceliopthora thermophile BJA has been improved from 0.44 to 0.76 by in vitro gene synthesis. The codon optimized endoglucanase gene (Mt-egl) has been constitutively expressed in Pichia pastoris under the regulation of GAP promoter. Recombinant endoglucanase (rMt-egl), purified by size exclusion chromatography, has been confirmed to be a monomeric protein of ∼47kDa. rMt-egl is optimally active at pH 10 and 50°C, displaying stability in broad pH and temperature ranges, with a t 1/2 of 60 and 15min at 90 and 100°C, respectively. This retained ∼70% of activity after 3h incubation at pH 5-12. The K m , V max , k cat and k cat /K m of rMt-egl were 5mgmL -1 , 20μmolesmin -1 mg -1 , 1.02×10 3 s -1 and 204s -1 mg -1 mL -1 , respectively. Homology modeling and bioinformatics analysis confirmed catalytically important role of glutamate 234 and 344. rMt-egl released high amounts of reducing sugars from wheat bran and corn cobs (421 and 382mgg -1 ), thus making it a useful biocatalyst for producing bioethanol and fine chemicals from agro-residues."

"28430356","abstracttext","CRISPR/Cas9 is a newly developed and naturally occurred genome editing tool, which is originally used by bacteria for immune defence. In the past years, it has been quickly employed and modified to precisely edit genome sequences in both plants and animals. Compared with the well-developed zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), CRISPR/Cas9 has lots of advantages, including easier to design and implement, higher targeting efficiency, and less expensive. Thus, it is becoming one of the most powerful tools for knockout of an individual gene as well as insertion of one gene and/or control of gene transcription. Studies have shown that CRISPR/Cas9 is a great tool to edit many genes in a variety of plant species, including the model plant species as well as agriculturally important crops, such as cotton, maize, wheat, and rice. CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing can be used for plant functional studies and plant improvement to yield, quality, and tolerance to environmental stress."

"28539660","abstracttext","Soluble starch synthase I (SSI) is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of plant amylopectin. In this study, the gene named IbSSI, was cloned from sweet potato, an important starch crop. A high expression level of IbSSI was detected in the leaves and storage roots of the sweet potato. Its overexpression significantly increased the content and granule size of starch and the proportion of amylopectin by up-regulating starch biosynthetic genes in the transgenic plants compared with wild-type plants (WT) and RNA interference plants. The frequency of chains with degree of polymerization (DP) 5-8 decreased in the amylopectin fraction of starch, whereas the proportion of chains with DP 9-25 increased in the IbSSI-overexpressing plants compared with WT plants. Further analysis demonstrated that IbSSI was responsible for the synthesis of chains with DP ranging from 9 to 17, which represents a different chain length spectrum in vivo from its counterparts in rice and wheat. These findings suggest that the IbSSI gene plays important roles in determining the content, composition, granule size and structure of starch in sweet potato. This gene may be utilized to improve the content and quality of starch in sweet potato and other plants."

"27734916","abstracttext","Ran, an important family of small GTP-binding proteins, has been shown to regulate a variety of important cellular processes in many eukaryotes. However, little is known about Ran function in pathogenic fungi. In this study, we report the identification and functional analysis of a Ran gene (designated PsRan) from Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), an important fungal pathogen affecting wheat production worldwide. The PsRan protein contains all conserved domains of Ran GTPases and shares more than 70% identity with Ran proteins from other organisms, indicating that Ran proteins are conserved in different organisms. PsRan shows a low level of intra-species polymorphism and is localized to the nucleus. qRT-PCR analysis showed that transcript level of PsRan was induced in planta during Pst infection. Silencing of PsRan did not alter Pst virulence phenotype but impeded fungal growth of Pst. In addition, heterologous overexpression of PsRan in plant failed to induce cell death but suppressed cell death triggered by a mouse BAX gene or a Pst Ras gene. Our results suggest that PsRan is involved in the regulation of fungal growth and anti-cell death, which provides significant insight into Ran function in pathogenic fungi."

"29349547","abstracttext","Feruloyl esterase (FAE)-encoding genes AnfaeA and AnfaeB were isolated from Aspergillus niger 0913. For overexpression of the two genes in Trichoderma reesei, constitutive and inductive expression plasmids were constructed based on parental plasmid pAg1-H3. The constructed plasmids contained AnfaeA or AnfaeB gene under the control of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase A gene (gpdA) promoter (from A. nidulans) or cellobiohydrolases I (cbh I) gene promoter (from T. reesei), and cbh I terminator from T. reesei. The target plasmids were transferred into T. reesei D-86271 (Rut-C30) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation (ATMT), respectively. A high level of feruloyl esterase was produced by the recombinant fungal strains under solid-state fermentation, and the cbh I promoter was more efficient than the gpdA promoter in the expression of AnfaeA. The optimum temperatures and pH values were 50 °C and 5.0 for AnFAEA, and 35 °C and 6.0 for AnFAEB. The maximum production levels were 20.69 U/gsd for AnFAEA and 15.08 U/gsd for AnFAEB. The recombinant fungal enzyme systems could release 62.9% (for AnFAEA) and 52.2% (for AnFAEB) of total ferulic acids from de-starched wheat bran, which was higher than the 46.3% releasing efficiency of A. niger 0913. The supplement of xylanase from T. longibrachiatum in the enzymatic hydrolysis led to a small increment of the ferulic acids release."

"29336716","abstracttext","In response to hypoxia, plant roots produce very high levels of nitric oxide. Recently, it was demonstrated that NO and ethylene both are essential for development of aerenchyma in wheat roots under hypoxia. Increased NO under hypoxia correlated with induction of NADPH oxidase gene expression, ROS production and lipid peroxidation in cortical cells. Tyrosine nitration was prominent in cells developing aerenchyma suggesting that NO and ROS play a key role in development of aerenchyma. However, the role of antioxidant genes during development of aerenchyma is not known, therefore, we checked gene expression of various antioxidants such as SOD1, AOX1A, APX and MnSOD at different time points after hypoxia treatment and found that expression of these genes elevated in 2 h but downregulated in 24 h where development of aerenchyma is prominent. Further, we found that plants growing under ammonium nutrition displayed delayed aerenchyma development. Taken together, new insights presented in this short communication highlighted additional regulatory role of antioxidants gene expression during aerenchyma development."

We aimed to investigate the association between the nucleotide diversity of ten F. culmorum candidate genes and field ratings of aggressiveness in winter rye. A total of 100 F. culmorum isolates collected from natural infections were phenotyped for FHB at two locations and two years. Variance components for aggressiveness showed significant isolate and isolate-by-environment variance, as expected for quantitative host-pathogen interactions. Further analysis of the isolate-by-environment interaction revealed the dominant role of the isolate-by-year over isolate-by-location interaction. One single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the cutinase ( CUT ) gene was found to be significantly ( p < 0.001) associated with aggressiveness and explained 16.05% of the genotypic variance of this trait in rye. The SNP was located 60 base pairs before the start codon, which suggests a role in transcriptional regulation. Compared to a previous study in winter wheat with the same nucleotide sequences, a larger variation of pathogen aggressiveness on rye was found and a different candidate gene was associated with pathogen aggressiveness. This is the first report on the association of field aggressiveness and a host-specific candidate gene codifying for a protein that belongs to the secretome in F. culmorum ."

"29701793","abstracttext","Conservation tillage and organic farming are strategies used worldwide to preserve the stability and fertility of soils. While positive effects on soil structure have been extensively reported, the effects on specific root- and soil-associated microorganisms are less known. The aim of this study was to investigate how conservation tillage and organic farming influence the frequency and activity of plant-beneficial pseudomonads. Amplicon sequencing using the 16S rRNA gene revealed that Pseudomonas is among the most abundant bacterial taxa in the root microbiome of field-grown wheat, independent of agronomical practices. However, pseudomonads carrying genes required for the biosynthesis of specific antimicrobial compounds were enriched in samples from conventionally farmed plots without tillage. In contrast, disease resistance tests indicated that soil from conventional no tillage plots is less resistant to the soilborne pathogen Pythium ultimum compared to soil from organic reduced tillage plots, which exhibited the highest resistance of all compared cropping systems. Reporter strain-based gene expression assays did not reveal any differences in Pseudomonas antimicrobial gene expression between soils from different cropping systems. Our results suggest that plant-beneficial pseudomonads can be favoured by certain soil cropping systems, but soil resistance against plant diseases is likely determined by a multitude of biotic factors in addition to Pseudomonas."

"29103986","abstracttext","A Cre-lox based auto-excision strategy has been adapted for barley, capable of cre and selectable marker gene (SMG) removal. The cold inducible wheat promoter called wcs120 was utilised for driving Cre expression. The binary vector was carrying the transgene (uidA) and a so called 'recombination cassette' flanked by the lox sequences. This part included both the recombinase gene and the SMG (bar) under the control of a constitutive promoter. T 0 , T 1 and T 2 transgenic plants were subjected to low temperature (at 4°C, 10°C and 12°C) at different developmental stages to induce recombination. The presence of uidA, cre, and bar genes and recombination footprints were studied by PCR and DNA sequencing, while cre transcription was followed by qRT-PCR. These analyses indicated that, cold treatment of the germinating seeds (4°C for 3days) followed by plant growing at higher temperature (24°C) has been the most efficient (90-100%), and this treatment lead to heritable changes in the genome. Thermal separation of Cre accumulation (at low temperature) from Cre enzyme activity (at higher temperature) could have prevented the premature excision of its own encoding gene, and lead to high expression level thereby increasing recombination frequency."

"29043591","abstracttext","The saprotrophic fungus Alternaria alternata is widespread in the agro-environment and produces more than ten allergenic proteins, mostly protein Alt a 1. The frequency of the Alt a 1 gene was analyzed in a group of A. alternata isolates from winter wheat kernels obtained in Poland, and the effectiveness of various fungicides targeting the pathogen was evaluated. The Alt a 1 gene was identified in four of the seven tested isolates. A. alternata colonized 35.67% kernels on average, but its frequency increased in stored grain where the presence of epiphytes was noted on 23.09 to 51.38% kernels, and endophytes-in 26.21 to 42.01% of kernels. The efficacy of field-applied fungicides did not exceed 50%, despite the fact that A. alternata is highly sensitive to propiconazole, fenpropimorph, and tebuconazole under in vitro conditions. The analyzed isolates were characterized by limited sensitivity to azoxystrobin (EC 50 ranged from 0.505 to 1.350 μg cm -3 ) due to a mutation at codon 143 of the CYT b gene, responsible for resistance to quinone outside inhibitor fungicides, which was noted in all isolates. The spread of A. alternata can be effectively controlled with suitable fungicides and by monitoring the prevalence of pathogenic isolates in the environment."

"29274114","abstracttext_background","Fusarium graminearum is the main pathogen of Fusarium head blight (FHB), a worldwide plant disease and one of the most significant wheat diseases in China. Demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides, such as tebuconazole (TEC), are widely used to control FHB, but long-term use leads to low efficacy against FHB. Earlier studies showed that DMI resistance is associated with the fungal sterol 14α-demethylase (cytochrome P450 CYP51) gene, and that point mutations in the CYP51 gene are the primary mechanism of resistance to DMI fungicides. The aims of this study were to clarify the molecular mechanisms of resistance to TEC and identify the binding sites on the FgCYP51B protein."

"29968147","abstracttext","A cosmid metagenomic library containing 1.3 × 10 5 clones was created from a soil sample. A novel gene (fae-xuan) encoding a feruloyl esterase was identified through functional screening. Primary sequence analysis showed that the gene consisted of 759 base pairs and encoded a protein of 252 amino acids. The gene was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and the corresponding purified recombinant enzyme exhibited a molecular weight of 29 kDa. The FAE-Xuan showed high activity (40.0 U/mg) toward methyl ferulate with an optimal temperature and pH of 30 °C and 5.0, respectively. Besides methyl ferulate, FAE-Xuan can also hydrolyze methyl sinapate and methyl p-coumarate. The substrate utilization preferences and phylogenetic analysis indicated that FAE-Xuan belongs to type A FAE. FAE-Xuan was quite stable over a broad pH range from 3.0 to 10.0. The activity reduced remarkably in presence of Cu 2+ . FAE-Xuan can enhance the quantity of ferulic acid from de-starched wheat bran in presence of xylanase. The work presented here highlighted the effectiveness of metagenomic strategy in identifying novel FAEs with diverse properties for potential use in industrial production."

"32330390","abstracttext","Agricultural practices such as manure applications could contribute to the spread of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within the environment. Our objective was to assess the impact of certain fertilization methods (mineral or manure) and tillage practices (reduced or conventional) on the presence of ARGs and bacteria in soil and drainage water under wheat and grain corn crops. Targeted ARGs tet (T), sul1 , and bla CTX-M-1 in liquid hog manure, soil, and water samples were quantified by qPCR. Conventional PCR was used to detect mcr - 1 and mcr - 2 . ARGs in control plots were detected despite the absence of manure, representing an environmental reservoir of resistant microorganisms. The manure application rate higher than 39 m 3 /ha increased tet (T) and sul1 gene concentrations in soil for more than 180 days. Tillage practices had no impact on ARG concentrations in soil and water samples. The bla CTX-M-1 gene was only detected in seven water samples in 2016, but no link was established with the treatments. The mcr-1 and mcr - 2 genes were not detected in all tested samples. This study demonstrated that tet (T) and sul1 gene concentrations increased in soil after liquid hog manure application as well as in drainage water in the next weeks."

"32555281","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum (Fg) is a devastating disease of crops, especially wheat and barley, resulting in significant yield loss and reduced grain quality. Fg infection leads to the production of mycotoxins, whose consumption is toxic to humans and livestock. The Arabidopsis DMR6 gene encodes a putative 2-oxoglutarate Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase (2OGO) and has been identified as a susceptibility factor to downy mildew. We generated site-specific mutations in Arabidopsis At2OGO by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. The resulting At2OGO knock-out (KO) mutants display enhanced resistance to Fg in a detached inflorescence infection assay. Expression profiling of defense genes revealed that impairment of At2OGO function resulted in the upregulation of defense genes that are regulated by salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET) pathways. Complementation of the At2OGO-KO lines with a barley (cv. Conlon) orthologue, Hv2OGO, restored susceptibility to Fg. This result indicates that the Hv2OGO gene is functionally equivalent to its Arabidopsis counterpart and, hence, may have a similar role in conditioning susceptibility to FHB in barley. These results provide a molecular basis for proposing 2OGO as a plant immunity suppressor in Arabidopsis and potentially in barley plants and establish a rationale and strategy for enhancing FHB resistance in barley."

Thirty-two pigs wererandomly assigned to one of four diets in a 2 × 2 factorial design in four replicate batches for 19days. The diets comprised either untreated or LA-treated wheat and maize without and withphytase supplementation (500 phytase units/kg). Although both treatments improved the Pbalance, phytase and LA-treated cereals differently modulated gene expression related to intestinalabsorption, and renal and bone metabolism of Ca and P, thereby altering homeostatic regulatorymechanisms as indicated by serum Ca, P, vitamin D, and fibroblast growth factor 23 levels.Moreover, phytase increased the gene expression related to reabsorption of Ca in the kidney,whereas LA-treated cereals decreased the expression of genes for osteoclastogenesis in bones,indicating an unbalanced systemic availability of minerals.

Phylogenetic and expression analyses identified the barley COMT orthologue(s) expressed in stems, defining a larger gene family than in brachypodium or rice with three COMT genes expressed in lignifying tissues. RNAi significantly reduced stem COMT protein and enzyme activity, and modestly reduced stem lignin content while dramatically changing lignin structure. Lignin syringyl-to-guaiacyl ratio was reduced by ~50%, the 5-hydroxyguaiacyl (5-OH-G) unit incorporated into lignin at 10--15-fold higher levels than normal, and the amount of p-coumaric acid ester-linked to cell walls was reduced by ~50%. No brown-midrib phenotype was observed in any RNAi line despite significant COMT suppression and altered lignin. The novel COMT gene family structure in barley highlights the dynamic nature of grass genomes. Redundancy in barley COMTs may explain the absence of brown-midrib mutants in barley and wheat. The barley COMT RNAi lines nevertheless have the potential to be exploited for bioenergy applications and as animal feed."

Since such an analysis often involves quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), endogenous reference genes with stable expression are required. Herein, we identified specific gene sets, suitable as references for qRT-PCR data normalization in A. aequalis plants under different experimental conditions, using geNorm, NormFinder, BestKeeper, and RefFinder software. Additionally, the reliability of reference genes was verified by analyzing the expression of genes encoding two major herbicide target enzymes: acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase) and acetolactate synthase (ALS). Furthermore, functional ALS gene amplification was likely present in resistant plants, although it may make no contribution to the resistant phenotypes."

In maize Black Mexican Sweet cells and wheat scutellum, increases in activity of 14- to 23-fold and 53- to 59-fold, respectively, are obtained using the codon-modified luciferase with the UBI1 promoter and its leader intron. The observed increase in luc+ expression is most likely a consequence of differences in codon usage reflecting tRNA abundance rather than an increase in the efficiency of intron splicing resulting from the small increase in the G+C content of the coding sequence. This difference in light emission between the wild-type and codon-modified luciferases can be clearly visualised in a low-light imaging camera, making the latter a much more sensitive and useful reporter gene for detecting luciferase activity in vivo."

Although GAPDH genes have been well characterized in various plant species such as Arabidopsis , tobacco, wheat, rice, and watermelon, comprehensive analysis has yet to be completed at the whole genome level in sweet orange ( Citrus sinensis ). In this study, six GAPDH genes distributed across four chromosomes were identified within the sweet orange genome. Their gene structures, conserved subunits, and subcellular localization were also characterized. Cis-element analysis of CsGAPDHs' promoter regions and the results of dark treatments indicate that CsGAPDH may be involved in photosynthesis. CsGAPDH genes expressed either in a tissue-specific manner or constitutively were ultimately identified along with their expression response to phosphorus deficiency treatments. In addition, a dual-luciferase transient assay was performed to reveal the transcriptional activation of CsGAPDH proteins. Gene Ontology (GO) analysis for proteins interacting with CsGAPDHs helped to uncover the roles these CsGAPDHs play in other plant processes such as citrus seed germination. This study provides a systematic analysis of the CsGAPDH gene family in the sweet orange genome, which can serve as a strong foundation for further research into the biochemical properties and physiological functions of CsGAPDHs ."

"31499444","abstracttext","High affinity potassium transporters (HKT) are recognized as important genes for crop salt tolerance improvement. In this study, we investigated HvHKT1;5 as a candidate gene for a previously discovered quantitative trait locus that controls shoot Na + and Na + /K + ratio in salt-stressed barley lines on a hydroponic system. Two major haplotype groups could be distinguished for this gene in a barley collection of 95 genotypes based on the presence of three intronic insertions; a designated haplotype group A (HGA, same as reference sequence) and haplotype group B (HGB, with insertions). HGB was associated with a much stronger root expression of HKT1;5 compared to HGA, and consequently higher K + and lower Na + and Cl - concentrations and a lower Na + /K + ratio in the shoots three weeks after exposure to 200 mM NaCl. Our experimental results suggest that allelic variation in the promoter region of the HGB gene is linked to the three insertions may be responsible for the observed increase in expression of HvHKT1;5 alleles after one week of salt stress induction. This study shows that in barley - similar to wheat and rice - HKT1;5 is an important contributor to natural variation in shoot Na + exclusion."

Gene expression was evaluated using real-time PCR. The stool consistencies of individuals fed a gluten diet were most frequently soft or diarrheic, while it was mostly normal in individuals fed a gluten-free diet. β-Defensin expression increased in individuals fed a gluten diet, but decreased after 15 days. Expression normalized between 30 and 45 days on a gluten-free diet. However, expression of the TLR5 gene did not change under a gluten diet. A gluten diet affects stool quality, and brings about an immediate increase in blood β-defensin expression in the beginning but decreases after 15 days."

"30342621","abstracttext","Small RNAs (sRNAs) play a key role in eukaryotic gene regulation, for example by gene silencing via RNA interference (RNAi). The biogenesis of sRNAs depends on proteins that are generally conserved in all eukaryotic lineages, yet some species that lack part or all the components of the mechanism exist. Here we explored the presence of the RNAi machinery and its expression as well as the occurrence of sRNA candidates and their putative endogenous as well as host targets in phytopathogenic powdery mildew fungi. We focused on the species Blumeria graminis, which occurs in various specialized forms (formae speciales) that each have a strictly limited host range. B. graminis f. sp. hordei and B. graminis f. sp. tritici, colonizing barley and wheat, respectively, have genomes that are characterized by extensive gene loss. Nonetheless, we find that the RNAi machinery appears to be largely complete and expressed during infection. sRNA sequencing data enabled the identification of putative sRNAs in both pathogens. While a considerable part of the sRNA candidates have predicted target sites in endogenous genes and transposable elements, a small proportion appears to have targets in planta, suggesting potential cross-kingdom RNA transfer between powdery mildew fungi and their respective plant hosts."
"31332893","articletitle","Pattern of changes in salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) gene expression and salicylic acid accumulation in wheat under cadmium exposure."
"31332893","abstracttext","Salicylic acid-induced protein kinase (SIPK) is known as a 'master switch' for stress responses in plants. It can be induced by salicylic acid (SA) and several stress factors. The main aim of the present study was to reveal the relationship between SA accumulation and the gene expression level of SIPK during 50 and 250 µm Cd stress in wheat plants. Quantitative real-time PCR was used for determination of the gene expression level of SIPK. Salicylic acid content measurement was performed with an HPLC system equipped with a fluorescence detector. Cadmium treatment increased the endogenous SA level and expression level of SIPK in a concentration-dependent manner. Induction of SIPK expression preceded the accumulation of endogenous SA. Although SA treatment induced dramatic endogenous SA accumulation, its SIPK-inducing effect was moderate. In roots, higher induction of SIPK was observed than in leaves. The same tendency of SIPK expression was observed in both Cd- and SA-treated plants, as decisively the highest transcript level was detected after 30 min of treatment, but thereafter the expression decreased rapidly to control level or even below. The induction of SIPK was transient in all cases, and even a very high SA level in either the leaves or roots was not able to maintain the elevated expression level of this gene. The results suggest that SIPK has a role in initiating Cd stress response and the exogenous SA-induced signalling process."

"32630013","abstracttext","Bioactive protein hydrolysates have been identified in several sources as possible agents in the prevention and treatment of many diseases. A wheat gluten (WG) concentrate was hydrolyzed by Alcalase under specific conditions. The resulting hydrolysates were evaluated by in vitro cell-free experiments leading to the identification of one bioactive WG protein hydrolysate (WGPH), which was used at 50 and 100 μg/mL on primary human monocytes. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrite levels and RT-qPCR and ELISA techniques were used to analyze the functional activity of WGPH. Our results showed that WGPH hydrolyzed in 45 min (WGPH45A) down-regulated gene expression of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-17, and Interferon gamma (IFNγ) and reduced cytokine release in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated monocytes. In addition, WGPH45A down-regulated gene-related to atherosclerotic onset. Our results suggest that WGPH45A has a potent anti-inflammatory and atheroprotective properties, reducing the expression of gene-related inflammation and atherosclerosis that could be instrumental in maintaining cardiovascular homeostasis."

"7996148","abstracttext","Particles of isolate T of potato mop-top furovirus (PMTV) contain three RNA species (6.5, 3.0 and 2.5 kb). Hybridization tests with cloned cDNA probes showed that none of these species was derived from another. RNA 2 (2962 nt), which was sequenced, has non-coding regions of 368 nt and 285 nt at the 5' end and 3' end, respectively. Near the 5' terminus, nucleotides 46 to 110 are able to form a stem-loop structure, the stem of which has 23 bp with only one mismatch and one unpaired nucleotide. From the 5' end, the four open reading frames encode proteins of 51K, 13K, 21K and 8K. The first three of these have sequence similarity to the triple-gene-block proteins of other viruses, particularly barley stripe mosaic hordeivirus. The 51K protein contains a putative NTP-binding motif and the 13K and 21K proteins each contain two hydrophobic regions separated by a hydrophilic region. The 8K protein is rich in cysteine. PMTV differs from other furoviruses in having a tripartite genome. Its RNA 2 differs in gene content from the RNA 2 of soil-borne wheat mosaic virus, which lacks a triple gene block, and from that of beet necrotic yellow vein virus, which has a coat protein gene and read-through domain to the 5' side of its triple gene block. The gene arrangement in PMTV is therefore novel for a furovirus."
"8219063","articletitle","A leaf-specific gene stimulated by light during wheat acclimation to low temperature."
"8219063","abstracttext","We report here the identification and characterization of a new leaf-specific light-stimulated gene induced during cold acclimation of wheat. Sequence analysis revealed that the gene encodes a protein of 19 kDa with a pI of 8.8. This is a novel protein with a particular charge distribution. The C-terminal half has a high propensity to form an alpha-helix and contains all the acidic amino acids with a net negative charge of -7. On the other hand, the N-terminal half is rich in proline, lysine and arginine with a net positive charge of +10. These properties are commonly found in several transcription factors. The protein is also rich in alanine (21%), is hydrophilic but not boiling soluble in contrast to other alanine-rich proteins. During low temperature exposure, the corresponding mRNA accumulates rapidly in the leaf and remains at a constant level in two tolerant cultivars used. However, in a less tolerant cultivar, the mRNA level declines despite maintaining the plants at 4 degrees C. Southern blot analysis indicates that the differential expression in the less tolerant genotype is not due to a different genomic organization or gene copy number. The mRNA was specifically localized in leaf tissues and increased several-fold during the greening at 4 degrees C. Furthermore, this gene is not induced in callus cultures acclimated in the absence or presence of light. This suggests that the full expression of this gene is dependent on organized leaf tissue. The expression of this gene was not affected by ABA, drought, heat shock, salinity, wounding or anaerobiosis, demonstrating that it is specifically induced by low temperature. The Wcs19 mRNA is preferentially expressed in tolerant Gramineae species."
"8631935","articletitle","A conserved domain of the viviparous-1 gene product enhances the DNA binding activity of the bZIP protein EmBP-1 and other transcription factors."
"8631935","abstracttext","The maize VP1 protein is a seed-specific regulator of gene expression that effects the expression of a subset of abscisic acid (ABA)-regulated genes that are expressed during the maturation program of the seed. In addition, VP1 has pleiotropic effects on seed development that are not related to ABA. In transient expression assays, VP1 has been shown to transactivate gene expression through at least two distinct promoter elements: the G boxes from the ABA-inducible wheat Em gene and the SphI box from the maize C1 gene. We have investigated how VP1 can transactivate gene expression through diverse promoter elements by analyzing its association in vitro with EmBP-1, a factor that binds the Em promoter. We demonstrate that VP1 can greatly enhance the DNA binding activity of EmBP-1 in a gel retardation assay. This enhancing activity has also been observed on transcription factors as diverse as Opaque-2, Max, Sp1, and NF-kappaB. Deletion of a small but highly conserved region (BR2) in VP1 eliminates the enhancement in vitro as well as the ability of VP1 to transactivate Em gene expression in a transient expression assay. A 40-amino acid fragment from VP1 sandwiched between the maltose-binding protein and LacZ can confer the enhancement function to this fusion protein in vitro. A weak and relatively nonspecific interaction between BR2 and DNA is demonstrated by UV cross-linking. The in vitro properties we observe for VP1 might explain the regulatory effects of VP1 on a diverse set of genes and why mutations in the vp1 locus have pleiotropic effects."

"11340177","abstracttext","The rice slender mutant (slr1-1) is caused by a single recessive mutation and results in a constitutive gibberellin (GA) response phenotype. The mutant elongates as if saturated with GAs. In this mutant, (1) elongation was unaffected by an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, (2) GA-inducible alpha-amylase was produced by the aleurone layers without gibberellic acid application, and (3) endogenous GA content was lower than in the wild-type plant. These results indicate that the product of the SLR1 gene is an intermediate of the GA signal transduction pathway. SLR1 maps to OsGAI in rice and has significant homology with height-regulating genes, such as RHT-1Da in wheat, D8 in maize, and GAI and RGA in Arabidopsis. The GAI gene family is likely to encode transcriptional factors belonging to the GRAS gene superfamily. DNA sequence analysis revealed that the slr1-1 mutation is a single basepair deletion of the nuclear localization signal domain, resulting in a frameshift mutation that abolishes protein production. Furthermore, introduction of a 6-kb genomic DNA fragment containing the wild-type SLR1 gene into the slr1-1 mutant restored GA sensitivity to normal. These results indicate that the slr1-1 mutant is caused by a loss-of-function mutation of the SLR1 gene, which is an ortholog of GAI, RGA, RHT, and D8. We also succeeded in producing GA-insensitive dwarf rice by transforming wild-type rice with a modified SLR1 gene construct that has a 17-amino acid deletion affecting the DELLA region. Thus, we demonstrate opposite GA response phenotypes depending on the type of mutations in SLR1."

"12964869","abstracttext","Two oat varieties, Melys (spring variety) and Bulwark (winter variety) were transformed by particle bombardment of primary embryogenic callus using either a ubi-bar-ubi-gus co-integration vector or co-transformed (Melys) with a ubi-bar plasmid together with one of three plasmids containing the beta-glucuronidase (gus) gene under the control of either a rice actin promoter, a CaMV35S promoter or a wheat high molecular weight glutenin promoter. Morphologically normal and fertile transgenic plants were regenerated following callus selection with glufosinate ammonium. Evidence for the integration and functioning of the selectable (bar) and reporter (gus) genes in T0 and T1 plants was confirmed by PCR, Southern hybridisation, fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH), histochemical assays, and by progeny analysis. Transformation rates varied from 0.2 to 5.0 lines/plate of callus bombarded, with co-transformation frequencies of 83 to 100%, and co-expression frequencies of 60 to 100%. Copy numbers for the bar and gus gene varied from 3 to 17 and from 2 to 20 respectively. Cell and tissue specific expression of the gus gene was evident from the different promoters, with the HMW glutenin promoter showing endosperm specific expression in T1 seed. No expression of the gus gene under the CaMV35S promoter was detected in any tissues. Progeny analysis provided evidence of Mendelian inheritance of the introduced genes suggesting either one or two unlinked integration sites. This was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisation to chromosome spread preparations. No segregation of the gus gene from the bar gene was observed in any of the progeny derived from co-transformation."

"11737780","abstracttext","A chimaeric gene was constructed comprising a wheat high molecular weight glutenin subunit gene promoter, a 304-bp sucrose non-fermenting-1-related (SnRK1) protein kinase sequence in the antisense orientation, and the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA gene terminator. Transgenic barley plants containing the antisense SnRK1 chimaeric gene were produced by particle bombardment of barley immature embryos with the aim of obtaining plants expressing the antisense SnRK1 sequence in the seeds. Despite the fact that the promoter was expected to be active only in seeds, two independent transgenic lines were found to fail to transmit the transgene to the T1 generation. These T0 plants had matured and died before this was discovered, but subsequently four other independent transgenic lines were found to be affected in the same way. Cytological analysis of the pollen grains in these lines showed that about 50% were normal but the rest had arrested at the binucleate stage of development, were small, pear-shaped, contained little or no starch and were non-functional. The presence of antisense SnRK1 transcripts was detected in the anthers of the four lines analyzed and a ubiquitin promoter/UidA (Gus) gene, one of the marker genes codelivered with the antisense gene, was found to be expressed only in the abnormal pollen. Expression analyses confirmed that SnRK1 is expressed in barley anthers and that expression of one class of SnRK1 transcripts (SnRK1b) was reduced in the abnormal lines. All of the abnormal lines showed approximately 50% seed set, and none of the transgenes were detected in the T1 generation."

"15859086","abstracttext","With the development of transgenic crops, regulations to label the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and their derived products have been issued in many countries. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods are thought to be reliable and useful techniques for qualitative and quantitative detection of GMOs. These methods are generally needed to amplify the transgene and compare the amplified results with that of a corresponding reference gene to get the reliable results. Specific primers were developed for the rapeseed (Brassica napus), high-mobility-group protein I/Y(HMG-I/Y) single-copy gene and PCR cycling conditions suitable for the use of this sequence as an endogenous reference gene in both qualitative and quantitative PCR assays. Both methods were assayed with 15 different rapeseed varieties, and identical amplified products were obtained with all of them. No amplification was observed when templates were the DNA samples from the other species of Brassica genus or other species, such as broccoli, stem mustard, cauliflower, Chinese cabbage, cabbage, sprouts, Arabidopsis thaliana, carrot, tobacco, soybean, mung bean, tomato, pepper, eggplant, plum, wheat, maize, barley, rice, lupine, and sunflower. This system was specific for rapeseed. Limits of detection and quantitation in qualitative and quantitative PCR systems were about 13 pg DNA (about 10 haploid genomes) and about 1.3 pg DNA (about 1 haploid genome), respectively. To further test the feasibility of this HMG-I/Y gene as an endogenous reference gene, samples containing transgenic rapeseed GT73 with the inserted glyphosate oxidoreductase (GOX) gene were quantitated. These demonstrated that the endogenous PCR detection systems were applicable to the qualitative and quantitative detection of transgenic rapeseed."

"18944309","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici, is an important foliar disease of wheat worldwide. Pyramiding race-specific genes into a single cultivar and combining race-specific resistance genes with durable resistance genes are the preferred strategies to improve the durability of powdery mildew resistance. The objectives of this study were to characterize a powdery mildew resistance gene in Suwon 92 and identify gene-specific or tightly linked molecular markers for marker-assisted selection (MAS). A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was derived by single seed descent from a cross between Suwon 92 and a susceptible cultivar, CI 13227. The RILs were screened for adult-plant infection type of powdery mildew and characterized with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The linked markers explained 41.3 to 69.2% of the phenotypic variances measured in 2 years. A morphological marker, hairy glume, was also associated with powdery mildew resistance in Suwon 92, and explained 43 to 51% of the phenotypic variance. The powdery mildew resistance gene in Suwon 92 was located on the short arm of chromosome 1A where Pm3 was located. Two gene-specific markers were developed based on the sequence of the cloned Pm3b gene. These two markers, which were mapped at the same locus in the peak region of the LOD score for the RIL population, explained most of the phenotypic variance for powdery mildew resistance in the RIL population. The powdery mildew resistance in Suwon 92 is most likely conditioned by the Pm3 locus. The gene markers developed herein can be directly used for MAS of some of the Pm3 alleles in breeding programs."
"22639584","articletitle","Large-scale co-expression approach to dissect secondary cell wall formation across plant species."
"22639584","abstracttext","Plant cell walls are complex composites largely consisting of carbohydrate-based polymers, and are generally divided into primary and secondary walls based on content and characteristics. Cellulose microfibrils constitute a major component of both primary and secondary cell walls and are synthesized at the plasma membrane by cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes. Several studies in Arabidopsis have demonstrated the power of co-expression analyses to identify new genes associated with secondary wall cellulose biosynthesis. However, across-species comparative co-expression analyses remain largely unexplored. Here, we compared co-expressed gene vicinity networks of primary and secondary wall CESAsin Arabidopsis, barley, rice, poplar, soybean, Medicago, and wheat, and identified gene families that are consistently co-regulated with cellulose biosynthesis. In addition to the expected polysaccharide acting enzymes, we also found many gene families associated with cytoskeleton, signaling, transcriptional regulation, oxidation, and protein degradation. Based on these analyses, we selected and biochemically analyzed T-DNA insertion lines corresponding to approximately twenty genes from gene families that re-occur in the co-expressed gene vicinity networks of secondary wall CESAs across the seven species. We developed a statistical pipeline using principal component analysis and optimal clustering based on silhouette width to analyze sugar profiles. One of the mutants, corresponding to a pinoresinol reductase gene, displayed disturbed xylem morphology and held lower levels of lignin molecules. We propose that this type of large-scale co-expression approach, coupled with statistical analysis of the cell wall contents, will be useful to facilitate rapid knowledge transfer across plant species."
"21735929","articletitle","A reproductive fitness cost associated with Hessian fly (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae) virulence to wheat's H gene-mediated resistance."
"21735929","abstracttext","We studied whether adaptation of the Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), to plant resistance incurs fitness costs. In this gene-for-gene interaction, adaptation to a single H resistance gene occurs via loss of a single effector encoded by an Avirulence gene. By losing the effector, the adapted larva now survives on the H gene plant, presumably because it evades the plant's H gene-mediated surveillance system. The problem is the Hessian fly larva needs its effectors for colonization. Thus, for adapted individuals, there may be a cost for losing the effector, with this then creating a trade-off between surviving on H-resistant plants and growing on plants that lack H genes. In two different tests, we used wheat lacking H genes to compare the survival and growth of a nonadapted strain to two H-adapted strains. The two adapted strains differed in that one had been selected for adaptation to H9, whereas the other strain had been selected for adaptation to H13. Tests showed that two H-adapted strains were similar to the nonadapted strain in egg-to-adult survival but that they differed in producing adults with smaller wings. By using known relationships between wing length and reproductive potential, we found that losses in wing length underestimate losses in reproductive potential. For example, H9- and H13-adapted females had 9 and 3% wing losses, respectively, but they were estimated to have 32 and 12% losses in egg production. Fitness costs of adaptation will be investigated further via selection experiments comparing Avirulence allele frequencies for Hessian fly populations exposed or not exposed to H genes."

"23052018","abstracttext","Stripe rust-resistant wheat introgression line CH223 was developed by crossing the resistant partial amphiploid TAI7047 derived from Thinopyrum intermedium with susceptible cultivars. The resistance is effective against all the existing Chinese stripe rust races, including the most widely virulent and predominant pathotypes CYR32 and CYR33. Cytological analyses using GISH detected no chromosomal segments from Th. intermedium. It was presumed that the segment was too small to be detected. Normal bivalent pairing at meiosis in CH223 and its hybrids confirmed its stability. Genetic analysis of the F(1), F(2), F(3) and BC(1) populations from crosses of CH223 with susceptible lines indicated that resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene. The resistance gene was mapped using an F(2:3) population from Taichung 29/CH223. The gene was linked to five co-dominant genomic SSR markers, Xgwm540, Xbarc1096, Xwmc47, Xwmc310 and Xgpw7272, and flanked by Xbarc1096 and Xwmc47 at 8.0 and 7.2 cM, respectively. Using the Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic and ditelosomic lines, the polymorphic markers and the resistance gene were assigned to chromosome arm 4BL. As no permanently named stripe rust resistance genes had been assigned to chromosome 4BL, this new resistance gene is designated Yr50. The gene, together with the identified closely linked markers, could be used in marker-assisted selection to combine two or more resistance genes in a single genotype."

The accuracy of a virtual gene order map (""genome zipper"") for barley (Hordeum vulgare), developed by combining a genetic map of this species with a large number of gene locations obtained from the maps constructed in other grass species, was evaluated here both at the genome-wide level and at the fine scale in a representative segment of the genome. Comparing the whole genome ""genome zipper"" maps with a genetic map developed by using transcript-derived markers, yielded an accuracy of >94 %. The fine-scale comparison involved a 14 cM segment of chromosome arm 2HL. One hundred twenty-eight genes of the ""genome zipper"" interval were analysed. Over 95 % (45/47) of the polymorphic markers were genetically mapped and allocated to the expected region of 2HL, following the predicted order. A further 80 of the 128 genes were assigned to the correct chromosome arm 2HL by analysis of wheat-barley addition lines. All 128 gene-based markers developed were used to probe a barley bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library, delivering 26 BAC contigs from which all except two were anchored to the targeted zipper interval. The results demonstrate that the gene order predicted by the ""genome zipper"" is remarkably accurate and that the ""genome zipper"" represents a highly efficient informational resource for the systematic identification of gene-based markers and subsequent physical map anchoring of the barley genome."

"24950734","abstracttext_key message","In this study, we identified eight DNA MTase genes in maize and the diversity of expression patterns of them was presented by EST mining, microarray and semi-quantitative expression profile analyses. DNA methylation plays a pivotal role in promoting genomic stability through diverse biological processes including regulation of gene expression during development and chromatin organization. Although this important biological process is mainly regulated by several conserved Cytosine-5 DNA methyltransferases encoded by a smaller multigene family in plants, investigation of the plant C5-MTase-encoding gene family will serve to elucidate the epigenetic mechanism diversity in plants. Recently, genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of the C5-MTase-encoding gene family have been characterized in multiple plant species including Arabidopsis, rice, carrot and wheat. However, little is known regarding the C5-MTase-encoding genes in the entire maize genome. Here, genome-wide identification and expression profile analyses of maize C5-MTase-encoding genes (ZmMETs) were performed from the latest version of the maize (B73) genome. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the orthologs from the three species (maize, Arabidopsis and rice) were categorized into four classes. Chromosomal location of these genes revealed that they are unevenly distributed on 6 of all 10 chromosomes with three chromosomal/segmental duplication events, suggesting that gene duplication played a key role in expansion of the maize C5-MTase-encoding gene family. Furthermore, EST expression data mining, microarray data and semi-quantitative expression profile analyses detected in the leaves by two different abiotic stress treatments have demonstrated that these genes had temporal and spatial expression pattern and exhibited different expression levels in stress treatments, suggesting that functional diversification of ZmMET genes family. Overall, our study will serve to present signification insights to explore the plant C5-MTase-encoding gene expression and function and also be beneficial for future experimental research to further unravel the mechanisms of epigenetic regulation in plants."

"25917918","abstracttext","The fungal pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (synonym Mycosphaerella graminicola) is a prominent pathogen of wheat. The reference genome of the isolate IPO323 is one of the best-assembled eukaryotic genomes and encodes more than 10,000 predicted genes. However, a large proportion of the previously annotated gene models are incomplete, with either no start or no stop codons. The availability of RNA-seq data allows better predictions of gene structure. We here used two different RNA-seq datasets, de novo transcriptome assemblies, homology-based comparisons, and trained ab initio gene callers to generate a new gene annotation of Z. tritici IPO323. The annotation pipeline was also applied to re-sequenced genomes of three closely related species of Z. tritici: Z. pseudotritici, Z. ardabiliae, and Z. brevis. Comparative analyses of the predicted gene models using the four Zymoseptoria species revealed sets of species-specific orphan genes enriched with putative pathogenicity-related genes encoding small secreted proteins that may play essential roles in virulence and host specificity. De novo repeat identification allowed us to show that few families of transposable elements are shared between Zymoseptoria species while we observe many species-specific invasions and expansions. The annotation data presented here provide a high-quality resource for future studies of Z. tritici and its sister species and provide detailed insight into gene and genome evolution of fungal plant pathogens."

"25771219","abstracttext","While phages of lactobacilli are extensively studied with respect to their structure and role in the dairy environment, knowledge about phages in bacteria residing in sourdough fermentation is limited. Based on the previous finding that the Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis phage EV3 carries a putative dextranase gene (dex), we have investigated the distribution of similar dex(+) phages in L. sanfranciscensis, the chance of gene transfer and the properties of the dextranase encoded by phage EV3. L. sanfranciscensis H2A (dex(-)), originally isolated from a wheat sourdough, expressed a Dex(+) phenotype upon infection with EV3. The dextranase gene was isolated from the transductant and heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli. The gene encoded a protein of 801 amino acids with a calculated molecular weight (Mw) of 89.09 kDa and a calculated pI of 5.62. Upon purification aided by a 6-His tag, enzyme kinetic parameters were determined. The Km value was 370 mM, and the Vmax was calculated in about 16 μmol of glucose released from dextran by 1 mg of enzyme in 1 min in a buffer solution at pH 5.0. The optimum conditions were 60 °C and pH 4.5. The enzyme retained its activity for >3h at 60 °C and exhibited only 40% activity at 30 °C; the highest homology of 72% was found to a dextranase gene from Lactobacillus fermentum phage φPYB5. Within 25 L. sanfransiscensis isolates tested, the strain 4B5 carried a similar prophage encoding a dextranase gene. Our data suggest a phage-mediated transfer of dextranase genes in the sourdough environment resulting in superinfection-resistant L. sanfranciscensis Dex(+) strains with a possible ecological advantage in dextran-containing sourdoughs."

The EPSPS (5-enol-pyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase) gene amplification confers glyphosate resistance in the tested Kochia scoparia (L.) Schrad populations from Montana. Experiments were conducted in spring to fall 2014 (run 1) and summer 2014 to spring 2015 (run 2) to investigate the growth and reproductive traits of the GR vs. glyphosate-susceptible (SUS) populations of K. scoparia and to determine the relationship of EPSPS gene amplification with the level of glyphosate resistance. GR K. scoparia inbred lines (CHES01 and JOP01) exhibited 2 to 14 relative copies of the EPSPS gene compared with the SUS inbred line with only one copy. In the absence of glyphosate, no differences in growth and reproductive parameters were evident between the tested GR and SUS inbred lines, across an intraspecific competition gradient (1 to 170 plants m-2). GR K. scoparia plants with 2 to 4 copies of the EPSPS gene survived the field-use rate (870 g ha-1) of glyphosate, but failed to survive the 4,350 g ha-1 rate of glyphosate (five-times the field-use rate). In contrast, GR plants with 5 to 14 EPSPS gene copies survived the 4,350 g ha-1 of glyphosate. The results from this research indicate that GR K. scoparia with 5 or more EPSPS gene copies will most likely persist in field populations, irrespective of glyphosate selection pressure."

In contrast, the mode of regulation by ABA of gene expression in liverworts (Marchantiophyta), representing one of the earliest diverging land plant groups, has not been elucidated. In this study, we used promoters of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha dehydrin and the wheat Em genes fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene to investigate ABA-induced gene expression in liverworts. Transient assays of cultured cells of Marchantia indicated that ACGT-core motifs proximal to the transcription initiation site play a role in the ABA-induced gene expression. The RY sequence recognized by B3 transcriptional regulators was also shown to be responsible for the ABA-induced gene expression. In transgenic Marchantia plants, ABA treatment elicited an increase in GUS expression in young gemmalings, which was abolished by simultaneous disruption of the ACGT-core and RY elements. ABA-induced GUS expression was less obvious in mature thalli than in young gemmalings, associated with reductions in sensitivity to exogenous ABA during gametophyte growth. In contrast, lunularic acid, which had been suggested to function as an ABA-like substance, had no effect on GUS expression. The results demonstrate the presence of ABA-specific response mechanisms mediated by conserved cis-regulatory elements in liverworts, implying that the mechanisms had been acquired in the common ancestors of embryophytes."

"29143605","abstracttext_background","Alike to Reduced height-1 (Rht-1) genes in wheat and the semi dwarfing (sd-1) gene in rice, the sdw1/denso locus involved in the metabolism of the GA, was designated as the 'Green Revolution' gene in barley. The recent molecular characterization of the candidate gene HvGA20ox2 for sdw1/denso locus allows to estimate the impact of the functional polymorphism of this gene on the variation of agronomically important traits in barley."
"29143605","abstracttext_results","We investigated the effect of the 7-bp deletion in exon 1 of HvGA20ox2 gene (sdw1.d mutation) on the variation of yield-related and malting quality traits in the population of DHLs derived from cross of medium tall barley Morex and semi-dwarf barley Barke. Segregation of plant height, flowering time, thousand grain weight, grain protein content and grain starch was evaluated in two diverse environments separated from one another by 15° of latitude. The 7-bp deletion in HvGA20ox2 gene reduced plant height by approximately 13 cm and delayed flowering time by 3-5 days in the barley segregating DHLs population independently on environmental cue. On other hand, the sdw1.d mutation did not affect significantly either grain quality traits (protein and starch content) or thousand grain weight."
"29143605","abstracttext_conclusions","The beneficial effect of the sdw1.d allele could be associated in barley with lodging resistance and extended period of vegetative growth allowing to accumulate additional biomass that supports higher yield in certain environments. However, no direct effect of the sdw1.d mutation on thousand grain weight or grain quality traits in barley was detected."

"27844244","abstracttext_key message","We report plausible disease resistance mechanisms induced by barley resistant genotype CI89831 against Fusarium head blight (FHB) based on metabolo-transcriptomics approach. We identified HvCERK1 as a candidate gene for FHB resistance, which is functional in resistant genotype CI9831 but non-functional in susceptible cultivars H106-371 and Zhedar-2. For the first time, we were able to show a hierarchy of regulatory genes that regulated downstream biosynthetic genes that eventually produced resistance related metabolites that reinforce the cell walls to contain the pathogen progress in plant. The HvCERK1 can be used for replacing in susceptible commercial cultivars, if non-functional, based on genome editing. Fusarium head blight (FHB) management is a great challenge in barley and wheat production worldwide. Though barley genome sequence and advanced omics technologies are available, till date none of the resistance mechanisms has been clearly deciphered. Hence, this study was aimed at identifying candidate gene(s) and elucidating resistance mechanisms induced by barley resistant genotype CI9831 based on integrated metabolomics and transcriptomics approach. Following Fusarium graminearum infection, we identified accumulation of specific set of induced secondary metabolites, belonging to phenylpropanoid, hydroxycinnamic acid (HCAA) and jasmonic acid pathways, and their biosynthetic genes. In association with these, receptor kinases such as chitin elicitor receptor kinase (HvCERK1) and protein kinases such as MAP kinase 3 (HvMPK3) and MAPK substrate 1 (HvMKS1), and transcription factors such as HvERF1/5, HvNAC42, HvWRKY23 and HvWRKY70 were also found upregulated with high fold change. Polymorphism studies across three barley genotypes confirmed the presence of mutations in HvCERK1 gene in two susceptible genotypes, isolating this gene as a potential candidate for FHB resistance. Further, the silencing of functional HvCERK1 gene in the resistant genotype CI9831, followed by gene expression and metabolite analysis revealed its role as an elicitor recognition receptor that triggered downstream regulatory genes, which in turn, regulated downstream metabolic pathway genes to biosynthesize resistance related (RR) metabolites to contain the pathogen to spikelet infection. A putative model on metabolic pathway regulation is proposed."

"30266409","abstracttext","High-throughput transcriptomics technologies have been widely used to study plant transcriptional reprogramming during the process of plant defense responses, and a large quantity of gene expression data have been accumulated in public repositories. However, utilization of these data is often hampered by the lack of standard metadata annotation. In this study, we curated 2444 public pathogenesis-related gene expression samples from the model plant Arabidopsis and three major crops (maize, rice, and wheat). We organized the data into a user-friendly database termed as PlaD. Currently, PlaD contains three key features. First, it provides large-scale curated data related to plant defense responses, including gene expression and gene functional annotation data. Second, it provides the visualization of condition-specific expression profiles. Third, it allows users to search co-regulated genes under the infections of various pathogens. Using PlaD, we conducted a large-scale transcriptome analysis to explore the global landscape of gene expression in the curated data. We found that only a small fraction of genes were differentially expressed under multiple conditions, which might be explained by their tendency of having more network connections and shorter network distances in gene networks. Collectively, we hope that PlaD can serve as an important and comprehensive knowledgebase to the community of plant sciences, providing insightful clues to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying plant immune responses.

"30654960","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a major cereal crop disease, caused most frequently by the fungus Fusarium graminearum. We have previously demonstrated that F. graminearum can utilize SA as sole source of carbon to grow. In this current study, we further characterized selected four fungal SA-responsive genes that are predicted to encode salicylic acid (SA)-degrading enzymes and we used a gene replacement approach to characterize them further. These included two genes predicted to encode a salicylate 1-monooxygenase, FGSG_03657 and FGSG_09063, a catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase gene, FGSG_03667, and a 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase gene, FGSG_09061. For each gene, three independent gene replacement strains were assayed for their ability to degrade salicylic acid in liquid culture. Salicylate 1-monooxygenase FGSG_03657 and catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase FGSG_03667 were shown to be essential for SA degradation, while a loss of 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase FGSG_09061 caused only a partial reduction of SA degradation and a loss of salicylate 1-monooxygenase FGSG_09063 had no effect when compared to wild type culture. Salicylate 1-monooxygenase FGSG_03657 and catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase FGSG_03667 were identified as the first two key enzyme steps of SA degradation via catechol in the β-ketoadipate pathway. Expression profiles for all four genes were also determined in liquid culture and in planta. Salicylate 1-monooxygenase FGSG_03657 and catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase FGSG_03667 were co-expressed and their expression was substrate dependent in liquid culture; however their expression was uncoupled in planta. Disruption of the gene for catechol 1, 2-dioxygenase FGSG_03667 was shown to have no effect on fungal virulence on wheat. Our results with 2, 3-dihydroxybenzoic acid decarboxylase FGSG_09061 raise the possibility of an alternate non-oxidative decarboxylation pathway for the conversion of SA to catechol via 2, 3-dihydrozybenzoic acid and for a connection between the oxidative and the non-oxidative decarboxylation pathways for SA conversion."

"31724236","abstracttext","The aim of the present study was to define whether elevated rumen-undegradable protein (RUP) and tannin-rich peanut skin (PS) supplementation would affect animal growth performance, average daily gain (ADG), blood metabolites, carcass traits associated with lipogenic and immune-related gene expressions in meat goats grazing winter wheat (WW). Thirty-six Kiko-crossbreed male goats at approximately 6 months of age were blocked by body weight (BW; 25.6 ± 1.1 kg) and randomly assigned to one of the four treatments with two replicates based on a 2 × 2 factorial design. Diets contained PS replacing alfalfa meal (ALM), without or with RUP supplementation. Both PS and ALM were incorporated into grain mix portion of the diet and pelletized, with remaining diets fed ad libitum of WW forage for a period of 51 days. Lipogenic genes examined included SCD, ACLY, YWHAZ, PPIA and FABP4, while immune-related genes examined included ACTB (as a control gene), H3F3A, PPIA, IRF3, STAT2, HERC3 and IFIT3 antibody genes. The meat goats on PS-pellet-supplemented group with or without RUP supplementation grew 38.5% faster ADG (p < .001) when compared to control-supplemented group. When goats received PS diet, empty body weight, hot carcass, cold carcass, shoulder, hind shank, rack, loin and fat thickness were greater (p < .05) than control diet. Animals on PS-pellet had higher ACLY, YWHAZ, PPIA and FABP4 gene expression (p < .05) when compared to ALM-pellet control, with RUP by PS-pellet interactions (p < .01). Goats receiving additional RUP supplementation had increased (p < .05) STAT2 gene expression, whereas goats receiving PS-pellet supplementation showed increased STAT2 (p < .05) and a tendency to increase IRF3 (p = .07) gene expressions. In conclusion, the addition of PS-pellet or RUP supplementation has the potential to improve ADG and altered selected lipogenic and immune-related gene expressions."

"33072173","abstracttext_background","Functional characterisation of genes using transgenic methods is increasingly common in cereal crops. Yet standard methods of gene over-expression can lead to undesirable developmental phenotypes, or even embryo lethality, due to ectopic gene expression. Inducible expression systems allow the study of such genes by preventing their expression until treatment with the specific inducer. When combined with the Cre-Lox recombination system, inducible promoters can be used to initiate constitutive expression of a gene of interest. Yet while these systems are well established in dicot model plants, like Arabidopsis thaliana , they have not yet been implemented in grasses."
"33072173","abstracttext_results","Here we present an irreversible heat-shock inducible system developed using Golden Gate-compatible components which utilises Cre recombinase to drive constitutive gene expression in barley and wheat. We show that a heat shock treatment of 38 °C is sufficient to activate the construct and drive expression of the gene of interest. Modulating the duration of heat shock controls the density of induced cells. Short durations of heat shock cause activation of the construct in isolated single cells, while longer durations lead to global construct activation. The system can be successfully activated in multiple tissues and at multiple developmental stages and shows no activation at standard growth temperatures (~ 20 °C)."
"33072173","abstracttext_conclusions","This system provides an adaptable framework for use in gene functional characterisation in cereal crops. The developed vectors can be easily adapted for specific genes of interest within the Golden Gate cloning system. By using an environmental signal to induce activation of the construct, the system avoids pitfalls associated with consistent and complete application of chemical inducers. As with any inducible system, care must be taken to ensure that the expected construct activation has indeed taken place."

"19432994","abstracttext_background","For plants to flower at the appropriate time, they must be able to perceive and respond to various internal and external cues. Wheat is generally a long-day plant that will go through phase transition from vegetative to floral growth as days are lengthening in spring and early summer. In addition to this response to day-length, wheat cultivars may be classified as either winter or spring varieties depending on whether they require to be exposed to an extended period of cold in order to become competent to flower. Using a growth regime to mimic the conditions that occur during a typical winter in Britain, and a microarray approach to determine changes in gene expression over time, we have surveyed the genes of the major pathways involved in floral transition. We have paid particular attention to wheat orthologues and functional equivalents of genes involved in the phase transition in Arabidopsis. We also surveyed all the MADS-box genes that could be identified as such on the Affymetrix genechip wheat genome array."

"25524236","articletitle","Regulation of Zn and Fe transporters by the GPC1 gene during early wheat monocarpic senescence."
"25524236","abstracttext_background","During wheat senescence, leaf components are degraded in a coordinated manner, releasing amino acids and micronutrients which are subsequently transported to the developing grain. We have previously shown that the simultaneous downregulation of Grain Protein Content (GPC) transcription factors, GPC1 and GPC2, greatly delays senescence and disrupts nutrient remobilization, and therefore provide a valuable entry point to identify genes involved in micronutrient transport to the wheat grain."
"25524236","abstracttext_results","We generated loss-of-function mutations for GPC1 and GPC2 in tetraploid wheat and showed in field trials that gpc1 mutants exhibit significant delays in senescence and reductions in grain Zn and Fe content, but that mutations in GPC2 had no significant effect on these traits. An RNA-seq study of these mutants at different time points showed a larger proportion of senescence-regulated genes among the GPC1 (64%) than among the GPC2 (37%) regulated genes. Combined, the two GPC genes regulate a subset (21.2%) of the senescence-regulated genes, 76.1% of which are upregulated at 12 days after anthesis, before the appearance of any visible signs of senescence. Taken together, these results demonstrate that GPC1 is a key regulator of nutrient remobilization which acts predominantly during the early stages of senescence. Genes upregulated at this stage include transporters from the ZIP and YSL gene families, which facilitate Zn and Fe export from the cytoplasm to the phloem, and genes involved in the biosynthesis of chelators that facilitate the phloem-based transport of these nutrients to the grains."
"25524236","abstracttext_conclusions","This study provides an overview of the transport mechanisms activated in the wheat flag leaf during monocarpic senescence.

"25577733","articletitle","Line differences in Cor/Lea and fructan biosynthesis-related gene transcript accumulation are related to distinct freezing tolerance levels in synthetic wheat hexaploids."
"25577733","abstracttext","In common wheat, cultivar differences in freezing tolerance are considered to be mainly due to allelic differences at two major loci controlling freezing tolerance. One of the two loci, Fr-2, is coincident with a cluster of genes encoding C-repeat binding factors (CBFs), which induce downstream Cor/Lea genes during cold acclimation. Here, we conducted microarray analysis to study comprehensive changes in gene expression profile under long-term low-temperature (LT) treatment and to identify other LT-responsive genes related to cold acclimation in leaves of seedlings and crown tissues of a synthetic hexaploid wheat line. The microarray analysis revealed marked up-regulation of a number of Cor/Lea genes and fructan biosynthesis-related genes under the long-term LT treatment. For validation of the microarray data, we selected four synthetic wheat lines that contain the A and B genomes from the tetraploid wheat cultivar Langdon and the diverse D genomes originating from different Aegilops tauschii accessions with distinct levels of freezing tolerance after cold acclimation. Quantitative RT-PCR showed increased transcript levels of the Cor/Lea, CBF, and fructan biosynthesis-related genes in more freezing-tolerant lines than in sensitive lines. After a 14-day LT treatment, a significant difference in fructan accumulation was observed among the four lines. Therefore, the fructan biosynthetic pathway is associated with cold acclimation in development of wheat freezing tolerance and is another pathway related to diversity in freezing tolerance, in addition to the CBF-mediated Cor/Lea expression pathway."

"25367379","abstracttext_key message","Wheat anther-specific invertase genes were haplotyped in wheat. Strong allelic selection occurred during wheat polyploidization, domestication and breeding because of their association with yield traits. Plant invertase hydrolyzes sucrose into glucose and fructose. Cell wall invertase (CWI), one of the three types of invertase, is essential for plant development. Based on isolated TaCWI genes from chromosomes 4A, 5B and 5D, two SNPs were detected in the promoter region of TaCWI-4A, and four SNPs and two Indels were present in the TaCWI-5D gene. No polymorphism was detected in TaCWI-5B coding or promoter regions. CAPS markers caps4A and caps5D were developed to discriminate haplotypes of TaCWI-4A and TaCWI-5D. Marker/trait association analysis indicated that Hap-5D-C at TaCWI-5D was significantly associated with higher thousand kernel weight (TKW) in 348 Chinese modern cultivars grown in multiple environments. Geographic distributions and changes over time of favored haplotypes showed that Hap-5D-C was the most frequent haplotype in modern cultivars and was strongly positively selected in six major wheat production regions worldwide. However, selection for haplotypes at TaCWI-4A was not so evident, possibly due to balancing effects of the two haplotypes on TKW and grain number per spike (GN). In rainfed production regions, Hap-4A-C was favored because it brought more seeds, but in well irrigated conditions, Hap-4A-T was favored in modern breeding because of higher TKW. Evolutionary analysis among wheat and its relatives showed that genetic diversity of TaCWI genes on chromosomes 4A and 5D declined dramatically in progression from the diploid level to modern polyploid cultivars. There was strong allelic selection during polyploidization, domestication and breeding."
"15604651","articletitle","Stable expression of 1Dx5 and 1Dy10 high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit genes in transgenic rye drastically increases the polymeric glutelin fraction in rye flour."
"15604651","abstracttext","We generated and characterized transgenic rye synthesizing substantial amounts of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) from wheat. The unique bread-making characteristic of wheat flour is closely related to the elasticity and extensibility of the gluten proteins stored in the starchy endosperm, particularly the HMW-GS. Rye flour has poor bread-making quality, despite the extensive sequence and structure similarities of wheat and rye HMW-GS. The HMW-GS 1Dx5 and 1Dy10 genes from wheat, known to be associated with good bread-making quality were introduced into a homozygous rye inbred line by the biolistic gene transfer. The transgenic plants, regenerated from immature embryo derived callus cultures were normal, fertile, and transmitted the transgenes stably to the sexual progeny, as shown by Southern blot and SDS-PAGE analysis. Flour proteins were extracted by means of a modified Osborne fractionation from wildtype (L22) as well as transgenic rye expressing 1Dy10 (L26) or 1Dx5 and 1Dy10 (L8) and were quantified by RP-HPLC and GP-HPLC. The amount of transgenic HMW-GS in homozygous rye seeds represented 5.1% (L26) or 16.3% (L8) of the total extracted protein and 17% (L26) or 29% (L8) of the extracted glutelin fraction. The amount of polymerized glutelins was significantly increased in transgenic rye (L26) and more than tripled in transgenic rye (L8) compared to wildtype (L22). Gel permeation HPLC of the un-polymerized fractions revealed that the transgenic rye flours contained a significantly lower proportion of alcohol-soluble oligomeric proteins compared with the non-transgenic flour. The quantitative data indicate that the expression of wheat HMW-GS in rye leads to a high degree of polymerization of transgenic and native storage proteins, probably by formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds. Even gamma-40k secalins, which occur in non-transgenic rye as monomers, are incorporated into these polymeric structures. The combination 1Dx5 + 1Dy10 showed stronger effects than 1Dy10 alone. Our results are the first example of genetic engineering to significantly alter the polymerization and composition of storage proteins in rye. This may be an important step towards improving bread-making properties of rye whilst conserving its superior stress resistance."

"12152337","abstracttext","Agricultural biodiversity adds value to crop, induces resistance, contributes enormously to human foodstuff, removes fear of genetic uniformity and ensure food security of the world. For these reasons, NIAB initiated a programme on collection, evaluation, and utilisation of agro-biodiversity related with wheat and wheat wild relatives. The focus of the programme was on the addition of stress tolerance from wild species to cultivated wheat. The objectives were i) to have a permanent source of stress tolerant germplasm, ii) to facilitate availability of such germplasm for environment friendly, profitable and sustainable agriculture on stressed lands and iii) to ensure safety of biodiversity (through gene conservation) for the stability of future agriculture. During 1998-2001, we tested wheat lines developed by using biodiversity residing in the Aegilops species. The material was tested in an area that required stress tolerant germplasm. Planting was done in fields where cotton was already growing up to the stage of second picking. The inputs included only half the amount of recommended dose of fertiliser, approximately half of the normal irrigation, no herbicide and two applications of compost. Two of the lines tested in these trials out-yielded all existing wheat cultivars traditionally grown in this area and convinced the farmers that biodiversity does play a role in adding value to the existing material, making it suitable for specific requirement. This paper describes, in detail, the significance of the plant material for the area, practical achievements, acceptance by the farmers and economic feasibility of the stress tolerant material developed at NIAB."

To identify genes expressed during early infection stages, in this study we constructed a cDNA library with RNA isolated from urediniospores of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici germinated for 10 h."
"18447959","abstracttext_results","A total of 4798 ESTs were sequenced from the germinated urediniospore library and assembled into 315 contigs and 803 singletons.

We selected six ESTs (Ps28, Ps85, Ps87, Ps259, Ps261, and Ps159) for assaying their expression patterns during urediniospore germination and wheat infection by quantitative real-time PCR. All of them had the highest transcript level in germinated urediniospores and a much less transcript level in un-germinated urediniospores and infected wheat tissues (1-7 dpi).

"16329893","abstracttext","The population dynamics, genotypic diversity and activity of naturally-occurring 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG)-producing Pseudomonas spp. was investigated for four plant species (wheat, sugar beet, potato, lily) grown in two different soils. All four plant species tested, except lily and in some cases wheat, supported relatively high rhizosphere populations (5 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(6) CFU/g root) of indigenous DAPG-producing Pseudomonas spp. during successive cultivation in both a take-all suppressive and a take-all conducive soil. Although lily supported on average the highest population densities of fluorescent Pseudomonas spp., it was the least supportive of DAPG-producing Pseudomonas spp. of all four plant species. The genotypic diversity of 492 DAPG-producing Pseudomonas isolates, assessed by Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of the phlD gene, revealed a total of 7 genotypes. Some of the genotypes were found only in the rhizosphere of a specific plant, whereas the predominant genotypes were found at significantly higher frequencies in the rhizosphere of three plant species (wheat, sugar beet and potato). Statistical analysis of the phlD(+) genotype frequencies showed that the diversity of the phlD(+) isolates from lily was significantly lower than the diversity of phlD(+) isolates found on wheat, sugar beet or potato. Additionally, soil type had a significant effect on both the phlD(+) population density and the phlD(+) genotype frequencies, with the take-all suppressive soil being the most supportive. HPLC analysis further showed that the plant species had a significant effect on DAPG-production by the indigenous phlD(+) population: the wheat and potato rhizospheres supported significantly higher amounts of DAPG produced per cell basis than the rhizospheres of sugar beet and lily. Collectively, the results of this study showed that the host plant species has a significant influence on the dynamics, composition and activity of specific indigenous antagonistic Pseudomonas spp."

We used sensitivity to Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB as two genetic markers to investigate the origin and the state of tan spot susceptibility in Canadian Western Red Spring (CWRS) wheat over a period of more than a century. Sensitivity to Ptr ToxA, the toxin produced by nearly all isolates of the pathogen collected in the past 20 years in western Canada, appears to have been present in the first major cultivar, Red Fife, grown massively in the late 1800s. Sensitivity then was transmitted unknowingly into Canadian wheat lines through extensive use of backcrossing to maintain the Marquis-Thatcher breadmaking quality. Sensitivity to Ptr ToxA, which nearly disappeared from cultivars grown in western Canada in the 1950s, was reintroduced in the 1960s and unintentionally bred into many of the present-day cultivars. Sensitivity to Ptr ToxB, a toxin rarely found in isolates from western Canada, appeared with the release of Thatcher in 1934 and was transferred to many cultivars through backcross programs. In spite of large areas planted to Ptr ToxAand Ptr ToxB-sensitive cultivars over decades, tan spot epidemics remained sporadic until the 1970s. The results of this study raise the problem of the narrowing genetic base of CWRS wheat lines and the potential for unanticipated threats from plant pathogens. The intercrossing of genetically diverse material in one Canadian wheat breeding program resulted in the release of several modern cultivars with resistance to tan spot. The absence of wild-type Ptr ToxB-producing isolates in western Canada remains unexplained, given that sensitivity to Ptr ToxB was present continuously in western Canadian cultivars grown on vast areas for more than 70 years."

"18931456","abstracttext","We investigated the evolutionary dynamics of wheat mitochondrial genes with respect to their structural differentiation during organellar evolution, and to mutations that occurred during cereal evolution. First, we compared the nucleotide sequences of three wheat mitochondrial genes to those of wheat chloroplast, alpha-proteobacterium and cyanobacterium orthologs. As a result, we were able to (1) differentiate the conserved and variable segments of the orthologs, (2) reveal the functional importance of the conserved segments, and (3) provide a corroborative support for the alpha-proteobacterial and cyanobacterial origins of those mitochondrial and chloroplast genes, respectively. Second, we compared the nucleotide sequences of wheat mitochondrial genes to those of rice and maize to determine the types and frequencies of base changes and indels occurred in cereal evolution. Our analyses showed that both the evolutionary speed, in terms of number of base substitutions per site, and the transition/transversion ratio of the cereal mitochondrial genes were less than two-fifths of those of the chloroplast genes. Eight mitochondrial gene groups differed in their evolutionary variability, RNA and Complex I (nad) genes being most stable whereas Complex V (atp) and ribosomal protein genes most variable. C-to-T transition was the most frequent type of base change; C-to-G and G-to-C transversions occurred at lower rates than all other changes. The excess of C-to-T transitions was attributed to C-to-U RNA editing that developed in early stage of vascular plant evolution. On the contrary, the editing of C residues at cereal T-to-C transition sites developed mostly during cereal divergence. Most indels were associated with short direct repeats, suggesting intra- and intermolecular recombination as an important mechanism for their origin. Most of the repeats associated with indels were di- or trinucleotides, although no preference was noticed for their sequences. The maize mt genome was characterized by a high incidence of indels, comparing to the wheat and rice mt genomes."

"16941219","abstracttext","Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, the causal agent of powdery mildew in wheat, is an obligate biotrophic fungus that exclusively invades epidermal cells. As previously shown, spraying of a solution of syringolin A, a circular peptide derivative secreted by the phytopathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae, triggers hypersensitive cell death at infection sites in powdery mildew infected wheat. Thus, the fungus is essentially eradicated. Here we show that syringolin A also triggers hypersensitive cell death in Arabidopsis infected with the powdery mildew fungus Erysiphe cichoracearum. To monitor transcriptional changes associated with this effect, we cloned 307 cDNA clones representing 158 unigenes from powdery mildew infected, syringolin A sprayed wheat leaves by a suppression subtractive hybridization cloning procedure. These cDNAs were microarrayed onto glass slides together with 1088 cDNA-AFLP clones from powdery mildew-infected wheat. Microarray hybridization experiments were performed with probes derived from leaves, epidermal tissue, and mesophyll preparations of mildewed or uninfected wheat plants after syringolin A or control treatment. Similar experiments were performed in Arabidopsis using the Affymetrix ATH1 whole genome GeneChip. The results indicate a conserved mode of action of syringolin A as similar gene groups are induced in both species. Prominent groups include genes associated with the proteasomal degradation pathway, mitochondrial and other heat shock genes, genes involved in mitochondrial alternative electron pathways, and genes encoding glycolytic and fermentative enzymes. Surprisingly, in both species the observed transcriptional response to syringolin A was considerably weaker in infected plants as compared to uninfected plants. The results lead to the working hypothesis that cell death observed at infection sites may result from a parasite-induced suppression of the transcriptional response and thus to insufficient production of protective proteins necessary for the recovery of these cells from whatever insult is imposed by syringolin A."

"17697785","abstracttext","Chitinases (EC 3.2.1.14) have been grouped into seven classes (class I-VII) on the basis of their structural properties. Chitinases expressed during plant-microbe interaction are involved in defense responses of host plant against pathogens. In the present investigation, chitinase gene from wheat has been subcloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL-21 (DE3). Molecular phylogeny analyses of wheat chitinase indicated that it belongs to an acidic form of class VII chitinase (glycosyl hydrolase family 19) and shows 77% identity with other wheat chitinase of class IV and low level identity to other plant chitinases. The three-dimensional structural model of wheat chitinase showed the presence of 10 alpha-helices, 3 beta-strands, 21 loop turns and the presence of 6 cysteine residues that are responsible for the formation of 3 disulphide bridges. The active site residues (Glu94 and Glu103) may be suggested for its antifungal activity. Expression of chitinase (33 kDa) was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western hybridization analyses. The yield of purified chitinase was 20 mg/L with chitinase activity of 1.9 U/mg. Purified chitinase exerted a broad-spectrum antifungal activity against Colletotrichum falcatum (red rot of sugarcane) Pestalotia theae (leaf spot of tea), Rhizoctonia solani (sheath blight of rice), Sarocladium oryzae (sheath rot of rice) Alternaria sp. (grain discoloration of rice) and Fusarium sp. (scab of rye). Due to its innate antifungal potential wheat chitinase can be used to enhance fungal-resistance in crop plants."

"17943267","abstracttext","Phytoene synthase (Psy), a critical enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, demonstrated high association with the yellow pigment (YP) content in wheat grain. Characterization of Psy genes and the development of functional markers for them are of importance for marker-assisted selection in wheat breeding. In this study, the full-length genomic DNA sequence of a Psy gene (Psy-A1) located on chromosome 7A, was characterized by in silico cloning and experimental validation. The cloned Psy-A1 comprises six exons and five introns, 4,175 bp in total, and an ORF of 1,284 bp. A co-dominant marker, YP7A, was developed based on polymorphisms of two haplotypes of Psy-A1, yielding 194 and 231-bp fragments in cultivars with high and low YP content, respectively. The marker YP7A was mapped on chromosome 7AL using an RIL population from cross PH82-2/Neixing 188, and a set of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic lines and ditelosomic line 7AS. Psy-A1, co-segregating with the STS marker YP7A, was linked to SSR marker Xwmc809 on chromosome 7AL with a genetic distance of 5.8 cM, and explained 20-28% of the phenotypic variance for YP content across three environments. A total of 217 Chinese wheat cultivars and advanced lines were used to validate the association between the polymorphic band pattern and grain YP content. The results showed that the functional marker YP7A was closely related to grain YP content and, therefore, could be used in wheat breeding programs targeting of YP content for various wheat-based products."

These data were imported to CMap to allow the visualization of the map positions of the ESTs and interrelationships of these ESTs with public gene models and representative cDNA sequences. The retrieved cDNA sequences corresponding to each EST marker were assigned to the rice genome to predict an exon-intron structure.

"20626919","articletitle","Increasing the amylose content of durum wheat through silencing of the SBEIIa genes."
"20626919","abstracttext_background","High amylose starch has attracted particular interest because of its correlation with the amount of Resistant Starch (RS) in food. RS plays a role similar to fibre with beneficial effects for human health, providing protection from several diseases such as colon cancer, diabetes, obesity, osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases. Amylose content can be modified by a targeted manipulation of the starch biosynthetic pathway. In particular, the inactivation of the enzymes involved in amylopectin synthesis can lead to the increase of amylose content. In this work, genes encoding starch branching enzymes of class II (SBEIIa) were silenced using the RNA interference (RNAi) technique in two cultivars of durum wheat, using two different methods of transformation (biolistic and Agrobacterium). Expression of RNAi transcripts was targeted to the seed endosperm using a tissue-specific promoter."
"20626919","abstracttext_results","Amylose content was markedly increased in the durum wheat transgenic lines exhibiting SBEIIa gene silencing. Moreover the starch granules in these lines were deformed, possessing an irregular and deflated shape and being smaller than those present in the untransformed controls. Two novel granule bound proteins, identified by SDS-PAGE in SBEIIa RNAi lines, were investigated by mass spectrometry and shown to have strong homologies to the waxy proteins. RVA analysis showed new pasting properties associated with high amylose lines in comparison with untransformed controls. Finally, pleiotropic effects on other starch genes were found by semi-quantitative and Real-Time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)."

"20549484","abstracttext","A new CMS system designated as 'msH1' has been reported in bread wheat using the cytoplasm of H. chilense. While testing this system in different wheat backgrounds, a highly fertile line with chromosome number 42 plus an extra acrocentric chromosome was obtained. The extra chromosome did not pair with any wheat chromosome at meiosis, and progeny from this line which lack the acrocentric chromosome showed pollen abortion and male sterility. In order to establish the origin of this chromosome, FISH using H. chilense genomic DNA as probe was used and showed that it had originated from H. chilense chromosome(s). The novel chromosome did not possess sequences similar to wheat rDNA; however, the probe pSc119.2 from S. cereale containing the 120 bp family was found to occur at the end of its long arm. Data obtained from FISH and EST molecular markers confirm that the long arm of the acrocentric chromosome is indeed, the short arm of chromosome 1H(ch) from H. chilense. We suggest that the novel chromosome originated from a deletion of the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 1H(ch). Neither the 1H(ch)S short arm, nor the whole chromosome 1H(ch) restores pollen fertility of the alloplasmic wheat. Therefore, the restorer gene on the acrocentric chromosome must be located on the retained segment from the hypothetical 1H(ch)L, while some pollen fertility inhibitor could be present on the deleted 1H(ch)L distal segment. Disomic addition of the acrocentric chromosome was obtained and this line resulted fully stable and fertile."

"19543880","abstracttext","ESTs-derived markers are useful for comparative genomic analysis and can also serve as phenotype-linked functional markers. Here, we report the development of EST-derived 2RL-specific markers and the evaluation of the possibility of functional assessment of markers tagging 2RL, which carries Hessian fly resistance genes (loci). To identify transcripts specific to 2RL, unigene sequences in combination with wheat progenitor genomes were used. Total 275 contigs mapped to the long arms of homoeologous group 2 chromosomes were downloaded. To obtain a cluster corresponding to each of the wheat 275 contigs, unigene sequences of wheat, rice, barley, and rye were pooled for cross-species clusters. Out of 275 clusters examined, it was possible to design 112 cross-species primer pairs for genome-specific amplifications. Out of 112 cross-species primer pairs, 45 primer pairs (40%) produced amplicons from at least one species (three wheat progenitors or rye). Among the 45 contigs, 73% were associated with one of known functions and 82% of the contigs associated with known functions were also associated with one of the GO categories. On the basis of the oligonucleotide sequence alignment of each of 45 genome-specific amplifications, 21 amplifications (47%) were suitable for designing RR genome-specific primers, which are specific to translocated rye chromatin 2RL. Six primer pairs (13%) successfully produced amplicons in the 2BS.2RL translocation lines and not in the non-2RLs. Functional assessment of one of the 2RL-specific markers, NSFT03P2_Contig4445, was performed on Hessian fly infested NILs. Under Hessian fly infestation, significantly high expression of a gene tagged by a 2RL-specific marker (NSFT03P2_Contig4445) was observed 1 day after infestation. EST-derived 2RL-specific marker development from this study provides a basis for the development of ESTs-derived markers for detecting wheat-rye translocations. In addition, these markers could be employed in elucidating functional analysis of genes on 2RL."

"23511197","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of short endogenous non-coding small RNA molecules of about 18-22 nucleotides in length. Their main function is to downregulate gene expression in different manners like translational repression, mRNA cleavage and epigenetic modification. Computational predictions have raised the number of miRNAs in wheat significantly using an EST based approach. Hence, a combinatorial approach which is amalgamation of bioinformatics software and perl script was used to identify new miRNA to add to the growing database of wheat miRNA. Identification of miRNAs was initiated by mining the EST (Expressed Sequence Tags) database available at National Center for Biotechnology Information. In this investigation, 4677 mature microRNA sequences belonging to 50 miRNA families from different plant species were used to predict miRNA in wheat. A total of five abiotic stress-responsive new miRNAs were predicted and named Ta-miR5653, Ta-miR855, Ta-miR819k, Ta-miR3708 and Ta-miR5156. In addition, four previously identified miRNA, i.e., Ta-miR1122, miR1117, Ta-miR1134 and Ta-miR1133 were predicted in newly identified EST sequence and 14 potential target genes were subsequently predicted, most of which seems to encode ubiquitin carrier protein, serine/threonine protein kinase, 40S ribosomal protein, F-box/kelch-repeat protein, BTB/POZ domain-containing protein, transcription factors which are involved in growth, development, metabolism and stress response. Our result has increased the number of miRNAs in wheat, which should be useful for further investigation into the biological functions and evolution of miRNAs in wheat and other plant species."
"23027061","articletitle","Designing effective amiRNA and multimeric amiRNA against plant viruses."
"23027061","abstracttext","RNA-mediated virus resistance is increasingly becoming a method of choice for antiviral defense in plants when effective natural resistance is unavailable. In this chapter we discuss the design principles of artificial micro RNA (amiRNA), in which a natural miRNA precursor gene is modified to target a different species of RNA, in particular viral RNA. In addition, we explore the advantages and effectiveness of multiple amiRNAs within one polycistronic amiRNA precursor against a virus, as illustrated with Wheat streak mosaic virus, WSMV. The judicious selection of amiRNAs, which are sequences of short length as compared to other related methodologies of RNA interference, greatly assists in avoiding unintended off-targets in the host plant. The viral sequences targeted can be genomic or replicative and should be derived from conserved regions of the published WSMV genome. In short, using published folding and miRNA selection rules and algorithms, candidate miRNA sequences are selected from conserved regions between a number of WSMV genomes, and are BLASTed against wheat TIGR ESTs. Five miRNAs are selected that are least likely to interfere with the expression of transcripts from the wheat host. Then, the natural miRNA in each of the five arms of the polycistronic rice miR395 is replaced in silico with the chosen artificial miRNAs. This artificial precursor is transformed into wheat behind a ubiquitin promoter, and its integration into transformed wheat plants is confirmed by PCR and Southern blot analysis. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this methodology using an amiRNA precursor that we have termed Fanguard. The processing of amiRNAs in transgenic leaves is verified through splinted ligation assay, and the functionality of the transgene in preventing viral replication is verified by virus bioassay. Resistance is confirmed using mechanical virus inoculation over two subsequent generations. This example demonstrates the potential of polycistronic amiRNA to achieve stable immunity to economically important viruses."

"21041976","abstracttext","Mlo is a plant-specific gene family, which is known to show stress responses in various plants. To reveal the genetic characteristics of the Mlo family in wheat, we isolated wheat Mlo members from a database and studied their expression in young shoots and roots under salt and osmotic stress conditions. In an in silico investigation, we identified seven Mlo members in wheat and named them TaMlo-1~TaMlo-7. None of the wheat Mlo showed significant induction or reduction of their expression under salt or osmotic stress, but organ-specific expression was observed in several TaMlo members. TaMlo-1, TaMlo-2, and TaMlo-5 were constitutively expressed in both shoots and roots, but TaMlo-3 and TaMlo-4 showed root-specific expression, and TaMlo-7 showed dominant expression in shoots. TaMlo-6 was weakly expressed in both shoots and roots. Phylogenetic analysis classified the plant Mlo members into six classes; four of them were comprised of angiosperm Mlo members, and the remaining two consisted of fern and moss Mlo members. The seven wheat Mlo members were classified into four angiosperm Mlo classes, similar to those of Arabidopsis and rice, indicating that the formation of each of the Mlo classes preceded the divergence of dicots and monocots. The differentiation of the expressional patterns among the seven TaMlo members was not related to their phylogenetic classification. This result suggested that the organ specific expression of individual Mlo members occurred relatively recently in their evolution."

"20842403","abstracttext","The evolution of five chromosomes of Brachypodium distachyon from a 12-chromosome ancestor of all grasses by dysploidy raises an interesting question about the fate of redundant centromeres. Three independent but complementary approaches were pursued to study centromeric region homologies among the chromosomes of Brachypodium, wheat, and rice. The genes present in pericentromeres of the basic set of seven chromosomes of wheat and the Triticeae, and the 80 rice centromeric genes spanning the CENH3 binding domain of centromeres 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 were used as ""anchor"" markers to identify centromere locations in the B. distachyon chromosomes. A total of 53 B. distachyon bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones anchored by wheat pericentromeric expressed sequence tags (ESTs) were used as probes for BAC-fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of B. distachyon mitotic chromosomes. Integrated sequence alignment and BAC-FISH data were used to determine the approximate positions of active and inactive centromeres in the five B. distachyon chromosomes. The following syntenic relationships of the centromeres for Brachypodium (Bd), rice (R), and wheat (W) were evident: Bd1-R6, Bd2-R5-W1, Bd3-R10, Bd4-R11-W4, and Bd5-R4. Six rice centromeres syntenic to five wheat centromeres were inactive in Brachypodium chromosomes. The conservation of centromere gene synteny among several sets of homologous centromeres of three species indicates that active genes can persist in ancient centromeres with more than 40 million years of shared evolutionary history. Annotation of a BAC contig spanning an inactive centromere in chromosome Bd3 which is syntenic to rice Cen8 and W7 pericentromeres, along with BAC FISH data from inactive centromeres revealed that the centromere inactivation was accompanied by the loss of centromeric retrotransposons and turnover of centromere-specific satellites during Bd chromosome evolution."

Exploiting and utilizing stripe rust resistance genes of wild species has become an essential strategy for resistance breeding. Psathyrostachyshuashanica Keng ex Kuo is a wild species in Triticeae that has been used for wheat improvement because of its high resistance or immunity to stripe rust. In this study, 9 wheat-P. huashanica addition lines were characterized by Giemsa C-banding, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), and disease resistance evaluation. Giemsa C-banding and GISH demonstrated that lines 163-5, 165-1, 183-5, 240-3, and 240-4 are P. huashanica 3Ns chromosome monosomic addition lines; lines 183-1 and 183-20 are P. huashanica 3Ns chromosome disomic addition lines; line 165-20 is a P. huashanica 3Ns and 4Ns chromosomes double disomic addition line, and line 219-1 is a P. huashanica 1Ns and 3Ns/5A chromosomes double disomic addition-substitution line. All these addition lines with P. huashanica 3Ns chromosome(s) expressed high resistance or immunity to stripe rust. By comparing the series of wheat-P. huashanica chromosome addition lines, we concluded that the P. huashanica 3Ns chromosome carries the gene(s) for resistance or immunity to stripe rust.

"22070279","abstracttext","Take-all disease of wheat caused by the soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici is one of the most important root diseases of wheat worldwide. Bacteria were isolated from winter wheat from irrigated and rainfed fields in Hebei and Jiangsu provinces in China, respectively. Samples from rhizosphere soil, roots, stems, and leaves were plated onto King's medium B agar and 553 isolates were selected. On the basis of in vitro tests, 105 isolates (19% of the total) inhibited G. graminis var. tritici and all were identified as Pseudomonas spp. by amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis. Based on biocontrol assays, 13 strains were selected for further analysis. All of them aggressively colonized the rhizosphere of wheat and suppressed take-all. Of the 13 strains, 3 (HC9-07, HC13-07, and JC14-07, all stem endophytes) had genes for the biosynthesis of phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA) but none had genes for the production of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, pyoluteorin, or pyrrolnitrin. High-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of 2-day-old cultures confirmed that HC9-07, HC13-07, and JC14-07 produced PCA but no other phenazines were detected. HPLC quantitative time-of-flight 2 mass-spectrometry analysis of extracts from roots of spring wheat colonized by HC9-07, HC13-07, or Pseudomonas fluorescens 2-79 demonstrated that all three strains produced PCA in the rhizosphere. Loss of PCA production by strain HC9-07 resulted in a loss of biocontrol activity. Analysis of DNA sequences within the key phenazine biosynthesis gene phzF and of 16S rDNA indicated that strains HC9-07, HC13-07, and JC14-07 were similar to the well-described PCA producer P. fluorescens 2-79.

"23275503","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON) is a natural toxin of fungi that cause Fusarium head blight disease of wheat and other small-grain cereals. DON accumulates in infected grains and promotes the spread of the infection on wheat, posing serious problems to grain production. The elucidation of DON-catabolic genes and enzymes in DON-degrading microbes will provide new approaches to decrease DON contamination. Here, we report a cytochrome P450 system capable of catabolizing DON in Sphingomonas sp. strain KSM1, a DON-utilizing bacterium newly isolated from lake water. The P450 gene ddnA was cloned through an activity-based screening of a KSM1 genomic library. The genes of its redox partner candidates (flavin adenine dinucleotide [FAD]-dependent ferredoxin reductase and mitochondrial-type [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin) were not found adjacent to ddnA; the redox partner candidates were further cloned separately based on conserved motifs. The DON-catabolic activity was reconstituted in vitro in an electron transfer chain comprising the three enzymes and NADH, with a catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) of 6.4 mM(-1) s(-1). The reaction product was identified as 16-hydroxy-deoxynivalenol. A bioassay using wheat seedlings revealed that the hydroxylation dramatically reduced the toxicity of DON to wheat. The enzyme system showed similar catalytic efficiencies toward nivalenol and 3-acetyl deoxynivalenol, toxins that frequently cooccur with DON. These findings identify an enzyme system that catabolizes DON, leading to reduced phytotoxicity to wheat."

One hundred and fourteen recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of Avocet (Susceptible) × Saar, were evaluated along with parents in two dates of sowing in India for 3 years (2007-2008 to 2009-2010) to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with spot blotch resistance, and to determine the potential association of Lr34 and Lr46 with resistance to this disease. Lr34 was found to constitute the main locus for spot blotch resistance, and explained as much as 55 % of the phenotypic variation in the mean disease data across the six environments. Based on the large effect, the spot blotch resistance at this locus has been given the gene designation Sb1. Two further, minor QTL were detected in the sub-population of RILs not containing Lr34. The first of these was located about 40 cM distal to Lr34 on 7DS, and the other corresponded to Lr46 on 1BL. A major implication for wheat breeding is that Lr34 and Lr46, which are widely used in wheat breeding to improve resistance to rust diseases and powdery mildew, also have a beneficial effect on spot blotch."
"22406981","articletitle","Mapping QTL for resistance to eyespot of wheat in Aegilops longissima."
"22406981","abstracttext","Eyespot is an economically important disease of wheat caused by the soilborne fungi Oculimacula yallundae and O. acuformis. These pathogens infect and colonize the stem base, which results in lodging of diseased plants and reduced grain yield. Disease resistant cultivars are the most desirable control method, but resistance genes are limited in the wheat gene pool. Some accessions of the wheat wild relative Aegilops longissima are resistant to eyespot, but nothing is known about the genetic control of resistance. A recombinant inbred line population was developed from the cross PI 542196 (R) × PI 330486 (S) to map the resistance genes and better understand resistance in Ae. longissima. A genetic linkage map of the S(l) genome was constructed with 169 wheat microsatellite markers covering 1261.3 cM in 7 groups. F(5) lines (189) were tested for reaction to O. yallundae and four QTL were detected in chromosomes 1S(l), 3S(l), 5S(l), and 7S(l). These QTL explained 44 % of the total phenotypic variation in reaction to eyespot based on GUS scores and 63 % for visual disease ratings. These results demonstrate that genetic control of O. yallundae resistance in Ae. longissima is polygenic. This is the first report of multiple QTL conferring resistance to eyespot in Ae. longissima. Markers cfd6, wmc597, wmc415, and cfd2 are tightly linked to Q.Pch.wsu-1S ( l ), Q.Pch.wsu-3S ( l ), Q.Pch.wsu-5S ( l ), and Q.Pch.wsu-7S ( l ), respectively. These markers may be useful in marker-assisted selection for transferring resistance genes to wheat to increase the effectiveness of resistance and broaden the genetic diversity of eyespot resistance."

"22416807","abstracttext_background","Wheat grains are an important source of food, stock feed and raw materials for industry, but current production levels cannot meet world needs. Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying wheat grain development will contribute valuable information to improving wheat cultivation. One of the most important mechanisms implicated in plant developmental processes is the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Among the different roles of the UPS, it is clear that it is essential to hormone signaling. In particular, E3 ubiquitin ligases of the UPS have been shown to play critical roles in hormone perception and signal transduction."
"22416807","abstracttext_results","A NimbleGen microarray containing 39,179 UniGenes was used to study the kinetics of gene expression during wheat grain development from the early stages of cell division to the mid-grain filling stage. By comparing 11 consecutive time-points, 9284 differentially expressed genes were identified and annotated during this study. A comparison of the temporal profiles of these genes revealed dynamic transcript accumulation profiles with major reprogramming events that occurred during the time intervals of 80-120 and 220-240°Cdays. The list of the genes expressed differentially during these transitions were identified and annotated. Emphasis was placed on E3 ligase and hormone-related genes. In total, 173 E3 ligase coding genes and 126 hormone-related genes were differentially expressed during the cell division and grain filling stages, with each family displaying a different expression profile."
"22416807","abstracttext_conclusions","The differential expression of genes involved in the UPS and plant hormone pathways suggests that phytohormones and UPS crosstalk might play a critical role in the wheat grain developmental process. Some E3 ligase and hormone-related genes seem to be up- or down-regulated during the early and late stages of the grain development."

"23184965","abstracttext","Wheat supplies about 20% of the total food calories consumed worldwide and is a national staple in many countries. Besides being a key source of plant proteins, it is also a major cause of many diet-induced health issues, especially celiac disease. The only effective treatment for this disease is a total gluten-free diet. The present report describes an effort to develop a natural dietary therapy for this disorder by transcriptional suppression of wheat DEMETER (DME) homeologs using RNA interference. DME encodes a 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylase responsible for transcriptional derepression of gliadins and low-molecular-weight glutenins (LMWgs) by active demethylation of their promoters in the wheat endosperm. Previous research has demonstrated these proteins to be the major source of immunogenic epitopes. In this research, barley and wheat DME genes were cloned and localized on the syntenous chromosomes. Nucleotide diversity among DME homeologs was studied and used for their virtual transcript profiling. Functional conservation of DME enzyme was confirmed by comparing the motif and domain structure within and across the plant kingdom. Presence and absence of CpG islands in prolamin gene sequences was studied as a hallmark of hypo- and hypermethylation, respectively. Finally the epigenetic influence of DME silencing on accumulation of LMWgs and gliadins was studied using 20 transformants expressing hairpin RNA in their endosperm. These transformants showed up to 85.6% suppression in DME transcript abundance and up to 76.4% reduction in the amount of immunogenic prolamins, demonstrating the possibility of developing wheat varieties compatible for the celiac patients."
"23372672","articletitle","Does wheat genetically modified for disease resistance affect root-colonizing pseudomonads and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi?"
"23372672","abstracttext","This study aimed to evaluate the impact of genetically modified (GM) wheat with introduced pm3b mildew resistance transgene, on two types of root-colonizing microorganisms, namely pseudomonads and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). Our investigations were carried out in field trials over three field seasons and at two locations. Serial dilution in selective King's B medium and microscopy were used to assess the abundance of cultivable pseudomonads and AMF, respectively. We developed a denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) method to characterize the diversity of the pqqC gene, which is involved in Pseudomonas phosphate solubilization. A major result was that in the first field season Pseudomonas abundances and diversity on roots of GM pm3b lines, but also on non-GM sister lines were different from those of the parental lines and conventional wheat cultivars. This indicates a strong effect of the procedures by which these plants were created, as GM and sister lines were generated via tissue cultures and propagated in the greenhouse. Moreover, Pseudomonas population sizes and DGGE profiles varied considerably between individual GM lines with different genomic locations of the pm3b transgene. At individual time points, differences in Pseudomonas and AMF accumulation between GM and control lines were detected, but they were not consistent and much less pronounced than differences detected between young and old plants, different conventional wheat cultivars or at different locations and field seasons. Thus, we conclude that impacts of GM wheat on plant-beneficial root-colonizing microorganisms are minor and not of ecological importance. The cultivation-independent pqqC-DGGE approach proved to be a useful tool for monitoring the dynamics of Pseudomonas populations in a wheat field and even sensitive enough for detecting population responses to altered plant physiology."

"24185819","abstracttext_key message","This manuscript describes the chromosomal location of a new source of stripe rust resistance in wheat. DNA markers closely linked with the resistance locus were identified and validated. A wheat landrace, AUS27858, from the Watkins collection showed high levels of resistance against Australian pathotypes of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici. It was reported to carry two genes for stripe rust resistance, tentatively named YrAW1 and YrAW2. One hundred seeds of an F3 line (HSB#5515; YrAW1yrAW1) that showed monogenic segregation for stripe rust response were sown and harvested individually to generate monogenically segregating population (MSP) #5515. Stripe rust response variation in MSP#5515 conformed to segregation at a single locus. Bulked segregant analysis using high-throughput DArT markers placed YrAW1 in chromosome 4AL. MSP#5515 was advanced to F6 and phenotyped for detailed mapping. Novel wheat genomic resources including chromosome-specific sequence and genome zipper were employed to develop markers specific for the long arm of chromosome 4A. These markers were used for further saturation of the YrAW1 carrying region. YrAW1 was delimited by 3.7 cM between markers owm45F3R3 and sun104. Since there was no other stripe rust resistance gene located in chromosome 4AL, YrAW1 was formally named Yr51. Reference stock for Yr51 was lodged at the Australian Winter Cereal Collection, Tamworth, Australia and it was accessioned as AUS91456. Marker sun104 was genotyped on a set of Australian and Indian wheat cultivars and was shown to lack the resistance-linked sun104-225 bp allele. Marker sun104 is currently being used for marker-assisted backcrossing of Yr51 in Australian and Indian wheat backgrounds."
"24170335","articletitle","Functional characterization of GPC-1 genes in hexaploid wheat."
"24170335","abstracttext","In wheat, monocarpic senescence is a tightly regulated process during which nitrogen (N) and micronutrients stored pre-anthesis are remobilized from vegetative tissues to the developing grains. Recently, a close connection between senescence and remobilization was shown through the map-based cloning of the GPC (grain protein content) gene in wheat. GPC-B1 encodes a NAC transcription factor associated with earlier senescence and increased grain protein, iron and zinc content, and is deleted or non-functional in most commercial wheat varieties. In the current research, we identified 'loss of function' ethyl methanesulfonate mutants for the two GPC-B1 homoeologous genes; GPC-A1 and GPC-D1, in a hexaploid wheat mutant population. The single gpc-a1 and gpc-d1 mutants, the double gpc-1 mutant and control lines were grown under field conditions at four locations and were characterized for senescence, GPC, micronutrients and yield parameters. Our results show a significant delay in senescence in both the gpc-a1 and gpc-d1 single mutants and an even stronger effect in the gpc-1 double mutant in all the environments tested in this study. The accumulation of total N in the developing grains showed a similar increase in the control and gpc-1 plants until 25 days after anthesis (DAA) but at 41 and 60 DAA the control plants had higher grain N content than the gpc-1 mutants. At maturity, GPC in all mutants was significantly lower than in control plants while grain weight was unaffected. These results demonstrate that the GPC-A1 and GPC-D1 genes have a redundant function and play a major role in the regulation of monocarpic senescence and nutrient remobilization in wheat."

"24201497","abstracttext","Heat-shock protein (HSP) gene expression in two wheat lines cv 'Mustang' (heat-tolerant) and cv 'Sturdy' (heat-susceptible) were analyzed to determine if wheat genotypes differing in heat tolerance also differ in in-vitro HSP synthesis (translatable HSP mRNAs) and steady-state levels of HSP mRNA. Several sets of mRNA were isolated from seedling leaf tissues which had been heat-stressed at 37 °C for various time intervals. These mRNAs were hybridized with HSP cDNA or genomic DNA probes (HSP17, 26, 70, 98, and ubiquitin). Protein profiles were compared using in-vitro translation and 2-D gels. The Northern slot-blot data from the heat-stress treatment provide evidence that the heat-tolerant cv 'Mustang' synthesized low molecular weight (LMW) HSP mRNA earlier during exposure to heat shock and at a higher level than did the heat-susceptible cv 'Sturdy'. This was especially true for the chloroplast-localized HSP. The protein profiles shown by 2-D gel analysis revealed that there were not only quantitative differences of individual HSPs between the two wheat lines, but also some unique HSPs which were only found in the 'Mustang' HSP profiles. The high level of RFLP between the two wheat lines was revealed by Southern blot hybridization utilizing a HSP17 probe. These data provide a molecular basis for further genetic analysis of the role of HSP genes in thermal tolerance in wheat."

"24331623","abstracttext","The objective of the current study was to evaluate the impact of wheat resistance on digestibility of Schizaphis graminum (Rondani) in the Coccinella septempunctata L. gut. Four wheat genotypes including an ancient wheat species (Einkorn) and three Iranian wheat genotypes (Azadi, Ommid, and Moghan2) were used. Einkorn was found to be a highly resistant species, while Azadi, Ommid, and Moghan2 were characterized as resistant, semiresistant, and susceptible genotypes, respectively, based on some biological parameters of S. graminum on these plants. Adult C. septempunctata starved for 24 h were fed one S. graminum reared on the selected wheat genotypes. A semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction technique using specific primers for the gene cytochrome oxidase II (COII) of S. graminum showed a significant effect of plant resistance on S. graminum DNA disappearance time. The DNA half-lives of S. graminum fed on Einkorn, Azadi, Ommid, and Moghan2 in C. septempunctata gut was 3.3, 3.6, 4.8, and 6.7 h, respectively. The findings suggest that digestibility of S. graminum fed on resistant plant genotypes is higher than those fed on susceptible plants because of the lighter weights and smaller sizes of the first. This phenomenon could result in faster ingestion of S. graminum by C. septempunctata on these resistant plants. It is also possible that some metabolites found differentially in Einkorn and Azadi genotypes may have affected S. graminum quality as a food for C. septempunctata."

"24448320","abstracttext","Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants are induced in various cellular compartments upon pathogen infection and act as an early signal during plant-pathogen interactions. Monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR) is involved in plant disease resistance through the regulation of the ROS level via the ascorbate-glutathione (AsA-GSH) cycle. In this study, TaMDHAR4 was firstly isolated from wheat cultivar Suwon 11, and this protein exhibits high similarity to MDHAR proteins from other plant species. Bioinformatics analyses indicated that TaMDHAR4 contains typical structural features, such as mPTS-like sequences in the C-terminal extension and trans-membrane domain followed by five basic arginine residues (-RKRRR), which predicted that this protein may be localized in the peroxisome. qRT-PCR analyses demonstrated that TaMDHAR4 could be induced by various exogenous hormones, such as ABA, MeJA, and ETH. TaMDHAR4 is sharply down-regulated at 12 and 18 hpi only in wheat leaves challenged with Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) race CYR23 and induced at 48 hpi with both Pst races CYR23 and CYR31. SOD and APX injection analyses demonstrated that TaMDHAR4 may be involved in the interaction between wheat and Pst through the regulation of its expression. Moreover, the knockdown of TaMDHAR4 through virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) enhanced the wheat resistance to Pst by inhibiting sporulation in the compatible interaction. Histological observations also demonstrated that silenced wheat resulted in an increased proportion of necrotic area at the infection sites and suppressed Pst hypha elongation. The study provided novel insights into the molecular functions of TaMDHAR4 during plant-pathogen interactions."

"25119869","abstracttext_key message","This study provides a link between a de novo gene and novel phenotype in wheat-rye hybrids that can be used as a model for induced de novo genetic variation. Wide hybridization can produce de novo DNA variation that may cause novel phenotypes. However, there is still a lack of specific links between changed genes and novel phenotypes in wide hybrids. The well-studied high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) genes in tribe Triticeae provide a useful model for addressing this issue. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of a wheat-rye hybridization method for inducing de novo phenotypes using the Glu-1Dx2.2 subunit as an example. We developed three hexaploid wheat lines with normal fertility and a Glu-1Dx2.2 variant, named Glu-1Dx2.2 (v) , derived from three F1 hybrids. The wild-type Glu-1Dx2.2 has two direct repeats of 295 bp length separated by an intervening 101 bp in its central repetitive region. In the mutant Glu-1Dx2.2 (v) , one copy of the repeats and the intervening sequence were deleted, probably through homology-dependent illegitimate recombination (IR). This study provides a direct link between a de novo allele and novel phenotype. Our results indicate that the wheat-rye method may be a useful tool to induce de novo genetic variations that broaden the genetic diversity for wheat improvement."

"25903161","abstracttext_background","Wheat is a major staple crop with broad adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions. This adaptability involves several stress and developmentally responsive genes, in which microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulatory factors. However, the currently used approaches to identify miRNAs in this polyploid complex system focus on conserved and highly expressed miRNAs avoiding regularly those that are often lineage-specific, condition-specific, or appeared recently in evolution. In addition, many environmental and biological factors affecting miRNA expression were not yet considered, resulting still in an incomplete repertoire of wheat miRNAs."
"25903161","abstracttext_results","We developed a conservation-independent technique based on an integrative approach that combines machine learning, bioinformatic tools, biological insights of known miRNA expression profiles and universal criteria of plant miRNAs to identify miRNAs with more confidence.

It allowed the discovery of 199 miRNA candidates associated with different abiotic stresses and development stages. We also highlight from the raw data 267 miRNAs conserved with 43 miRBase families. The predicted miRNAs are highly associated with abiotic stress responses, tolerance and development. GO enrichment analysis showed that they may play biological and physiological roles associated with cold, salt and aluminum (Al) through auxin signaling pathways, regulation of gene expression, ubiquitination, transport, carbohydrates, gibberellins, lipid, glutathione and secondary metabolism, photosynthesis, as well as floral transition and flowering."

"25821073","abstracttext","Climate change has generated unpredictability in the timing and amount of rain, as well as extreme heat and cold spells that have affected grain yields worldwide and threaten food security. Sources of specific adaptation related to drought and heat, as well as associated breeding of genetic traits, will contribute to maintaining grain yields in dry and warm years. Increased crop photosynthesis and biomass have been achieved particularly through disease resistance and healthy leaves. Similarly, sources of drought and heat adaptation through extended photosynthesis and increased biomass would also greatly benefit crop improvement. Wheat landraces have been cultivated for thousands of years under the most extreme environmental conditions. They have also been cultivated in lower input farming systems for which adaptation traits, particularly those that increase the duration of photosynthesis, have been conserved. Landraces are a valuable source of genetic diversity and specific adaptation to local environmental conditions according to their place of origin. Evidence supports the hypothesis that landraces can provide sources of increased biomass and thousand kernel weight, both important traits for adaptation to tolerate drought and heat. Evaluation of wheat landraces stored in gene banks with highly beneficial untapped diversity and sources of stress adaptation, once characterized, should also be used for wheat improvement. Unified development of databases and promotion of data sharing among physiologists, pathologists, wheat quality scientists, national programmes, and breeders will greatly benefit wheat improvement for adaptation to climate change worldwide."

Only recently have studies started to consider the complexity of these processes instead of simply describing diversity for breeding purposes. A first step in that aim is to add multiple references to the collection of genetic data, including the farmers' varietal taxonomy and practices and the historical background of the crop."
"25528060","abstracttext_results","On the basis of interview data collected in a previous study, we sampled 166 populations of durum wheat varieties in two traditional Moroccan agrosystems, in the Pre-Rif and Atlas Mountains regions. Using a common garden experiment, we detected a high phenotypic variability on traits indicative of taxonomical position and breeding status, namely spike shape and plant height. Populations often combined modern (short) with traditional-like (tall) statures, and classical durum squared spike shape (5 flowers/spikelet) with flat spike shape (3 flowers/ spikelet) representative of primitive domesticated tetraploid wheat (ssp. dicoccum). By contrast, the genetic diversity assessed using 14 microsatellite markers was relatively limited. When compared to the genetic diversity found in a large collection of tetraploid wheat, it corresponded to free-threshing tetraploid wheat. Within Morocco, the two studied regions differed for both genetic diversity and variety names. Within regions, neither geography nor variety names nor even breeding status constituted strong barriers to gene exchange despite a few significant patterns."
"25528060","abstracttext_conclusions","This first assessment of morphological and genetic diversity allowed pointing out some important factors that may have influenced the structure and evolutionary dynamics of durum wheat in Morocco: the significance of variety names, the occurrence of mixtures within populations, the relative strength of seed exchange between farmers and local adaptation, as well as the fate of modern varieties once they have been introduced. Further, multidisciplinary studies at different spatial scales are needed to better understand these complex agrosystems of invaluable importance for food security."

Grain yield (GY) can be dissected into its components thousand grain weight (TGW) and grain number (GN), but little has been achieved in assessing the trade-off between them in spring wheat. In the present study, the Wheat Association Mapping Initiative (WAMI) panel of 287 elite spring bread wheat lines was phenotyped for GY, GN, and TGW in ten environments across different wheat growing regions in Mexico, South Asia, and North Africa. The panel genotyped with the 90 K Illumina Infinitum SNP array resulted in 26,814 SNPs for genome-wide association study (GWAS). Statistical analysis of the multi-environmental data for GY, GN, and TGW observed repeatability estimates of 0.76, 0.62, and 0.95, respectively. GWAS on BLUPs of combined environment analysis identified 38 loci associated with the traits. Among them four loci-6A (85 cM), 5A (98 cM), 3B (99 cM), and 2B (96 cM)-were associated with multiple traits. The study identified two loci that showed positive association between GY and TGW, with allelic substitution effects of 4% (GY) and 1.7% (TGW) for 6A locus and 0.2% (GY) and 7.2% (TGW) for 2B locus. The locus in chromosome 6A (79-85 cM) harbored a gene TaGW2-6A. We also identified that a combination of markers associated with GY, TGW, and GN together explained higher variation for GY (32%), than the markers associated with GY alone (27%). The marker-trait associations from the present study can be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) and to discover the underlying genes for these traits in spring wheat."

"28667571","abstracttext","A significant portion of organic phosphorus comprises of phytates which are not available to wheat for uptake. Hence for enabling wheat to utilize organic phosphorus in form of phytate, transgenic wheat expressing phytase from Aspergillus japonicus under barley root-specific promoter was developed. Transgenic events were initially screened via selection media containing BASTA, followed by PCR and BASTA leaf paint assay after hardening. Out of 138 successfully regenerated T o events, only 12 had complete constructs and thus further analyzed. Positive T1 transgenic plants, grown in sand, exhibited 0.08-1.77, 0.02-0.67 and 0.44-2.14 fold increase in phytase activity in root extracts, intact roots and external root solution, respectively, after 4 weeks of phosphorus stress. Based on these results, T2 generation of four best transgenic events was further analyzed which showed up to 1.32, 56.89, and 15.40 fold increase in phytase activity in root extracts, intact roots and external root solution, respectively, while in case of real-time PCR, maximum fold increase of 19.8 in gene expression was observed. Transgenic lines showed 0.01-1.18 fold increase in phosphorus efficiency along with higher phosphorus content when supplied phytate or inorganic phosphorus than control plants. Thus, this transgenic wheat may aid in reducing fertilizer utilization and enhancing wheat yield."

"27744491","abstracttext_key message","This research provides the first report of a major locus controlling wheat resistance to Sunn pest. It developed and validated SNP markers that will be useful for marker-assisted selection. Sunn pest (Eurygaster integriceps Puton) is the most destructive insect pest of bread wheat and durum wheat in West and Central Asia and East Europe. Breeding for resistance at the vegetative stage of growth is vital in reducing the damage caused by overwintered adult populations that feed on shoot and leaves of seedlings, and in reducing the next generation of pest populations (nymphs and adults), which can cause damage to grain quality by feeding on spikes. In the present study, two doubled haploid (DH) populations involving resistant landraces from Afghanistan were genotyped with the 90k SNP iSelect assay and candidate gene-based KASP markers. The DH lines and parents were phenotyped for resistance to Sunn pest feeding, using artificial infestation cages at Terbol station, in Lebanon, over three years. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified a single major locus on chromosome 4BS in the two populations, with the resistance allele derived from the landrace accessions, IG139431 and IG139883. The QTL explained a maximum of 42 % of the phenotypic variation in the Cham6 × IG139431 and 56 % in the Cham6 × IG139883 populations. SNP markers closest to the QTL showed high similarity to rice genes that putatively encode proteins for defense response to herbivory and wounding. The markers were validated in a large, unrelated population of parental wheat genotypes. All wheat lines carrying the 'C-G' haplotype at the identified SNPs were resistant, suggesting that selection based on a haplotype of favourable alleles would be effective in predicting resistance status of unknown genotypes."

In present study, the total RNA was extracted from leaves of wheat seedlings under dehydration-stressed and well-watered conditions, respectively. Then, the circRNAs enriched library based deep sequencing was performed and the circRNAs were identified using bioinformatics tools. Around 88 circRNAs candidates were isolated in wheat seedlings leaves while 62 were differentially expressed in dehydration-stressed seedlings compared to well-watered control. Among the dehydration responsive circRNAs, six were found to act as 26 corresponding miRNAs sponges in wheat. Sixteen circRNAs including the 6 miRNAs sponges and other 10 randomly selected ones were further validated to be circular by real-time PCR assay, and 14 displayed consistent regulation patterns with the transcriptome sequencing results. After Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis of the targeted mRNAs functions, the circRNAs were predicted to be involved in dehydration responsive process, such as photosynthesis, porphyrin, and chlorophyll metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, amino acid biosynthesis, and metabolism, as well as plant hormone signal transduction, involving auxin, brassinosteroid, and salicylic acid. Herein, we revealed a possible connection between the regulations of circRNAs with the expressions of functional genes in wheat leaves associated with dehydration resistance."

"29258439","abstracttext_background","Among wheat gluten proteins, the α-type gliadins are the major responsible for celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects about 1% of the world population. In fact, these proteins contain several toxic and immunogenic epitopes that trigger the onset of the disease. The α-type gliadins are a multigene family, encoded by genes located at the complex Gli-2 loci."
"29258439","abstracttext_results","Here, three bread wheat deletion lines (Gli-A2, Gli-D2 and Gli-A2/Gli-D2) at the Gli-2 loci were generated by the introgression in the bread wheat cultivar Pegaso of natural mutations, detected in different bread wheat cultivars. The molecular characterization of these lines allowed the isolation of 49 unique expressed genes coding α-type gliadins, that were assigned to each of the three Gli-2 loci. The number and the amount of α-type gliadin transcripts were drastically reduced in the deletion lines. In particular, the line Gli-A2/Gli-D2 contained only 12 active α-type gliadin genes (-75.6% respect to the cv. Pegaso) and a minor level of transcripts (-80% compared to cv. Pegaso). Compensatory pleiotropic effects were observed in the two other classes of gliadins (ω- and γ-gliadins) either at gene expression or protein levels. Although the comparative analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences highlighted the typical structural features of α-type gliadin proteins, substantial differences were displayed among the 49 proteins for the presence of toxic and immunogenic epitopes."
"29258439","abstracttext_conclusion","The deletion line Gli-A2/Gli-D2 did not contain the 33-mer peptide, one of the major epitopes triggering the celiac disease, representing an interesting material to develop less ""toxic"" wheat varieties."
"29402221","articletitle","Transcriptome analysis reveals potential mechanisms for different grain size between natural and resynthesized allohexaploid wheats with near-identical AABB genomes."
"29402221","abstracttext_background","Common wheat is a typical allohexaploid species (AABBDD) derived from the interspecific crossing between allotetraploid wheat (AABB) and Aegilops tauschii (DD). Wide variation in grain size and shape observed among Aegilops tauschii can be retained in synthetic allohexaploid wheats, but the underlying mechanism remains enigmatic. Here, the natural and resynthesized allohexaploid wheats with near-identical AB genomes and different D genomes (TAA10 and XX329) were employed for analysis."
"29402221","abstracttext_results","Significant differences in grain size and weight between TAA10 and XX329 were observed at the early stages of development, which could be mainly attributed to the higher growth rates of the pericarp and endosperm cells in XX329 compared to TAA10. Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis identified that 8891 of 69,711 unigenes (12.75%) were differentially expressed between grains at 6 days after pollination (DAP) of TAA10 and XX329, including 5314 up-regulated and 3577 down-regulated genes in XX329 compared to TAA10. The MapMan functional annotation and enrichment analysis revealed that the differentially expressed genes were significantly enriched in categories of cell wall, carbohydrate and hormone metabolism. Notably, consistent with the up-regulation of sucrose synthase genes in resynthesized relative to natural allohexaploid wheat, the resynthesized allohexaploid wheat accumulated much higher contents of glucose and fructose in 6-DAP grains than those of the natural allohexaploid wheat."
"29402221","abstracttext_conclusions","These data indicated that the genetic variation of the D genome induced drastic alterations of gene expression in grains of the natural and resynthesized allohexaploid wheats, which may contribute to the observed differences in grain size and weight."

"27689975","abstracttext","The purpose of this study was to investigate the phytochemical compositions and antioxidant capacity, cell growth inhibition, and apoptosis induction in extracts of immature wheat bran. Immature wheat bran (IWB) was obtained from immature wheat harvested 10 days earlier than mature wheat. The phytochemical compositions of bran extract samples were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography. The total ferulic acid (3.09 mg/g) and p -coumaric acid (75 µg/g) in IWB were significantly higher than in mature wheat bran (MWB, ferulic acid: 1.79 mg/g; p -coumaric acid: 55 µg/g). The oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC: 327 µM Trolox equivalents (TE)/g) and cellular antioxidant activity (CAA: 4.59 µM Quercetin equivalents (QE)/g) of the IWB were higher than those of the MWB (ORAC: 281 µM TE/g; CAA: 0.63 µM QE/g). When assessing cell proliferation, the IWB extracts resulted in the lowest EC 50 values against HT-29 (18.9 mg/mL), Caco-2 (7.74 mg/mL), and HeLa cells (8.17 mg/mL) among bran extract samples. Additionally, the IWB extracts increased the gene expression of p53 and PTEN (tumor suppressor genes) in HT-29 cells, indicating inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis through tumor suppressor genes."

"28286717","abstracttext","This study compared the effects of wheat- and sorghum-based diets on broiler chickens. The growth performance and caecal microbial community of chickens were measured and correlations between productivity and specific gut microbes were observed. Cobb broilers 15 days of age were individually caged and two dietary treatments were used, one with a wheat-based diet ( n  = 48) and another one with a sorghum-based diet ( n  = 48). Growth performance measurements were taken over a 10 day period and samples for microbiota analysis were taken at the end of that period. Caecal microbiota was characterised by sequencing of 16S bacterial rRNA gene amplicons. Overall, the results indicated that a sorghum-based diet produced higher apparent metabolisable energy (AME) and body-weight gain (BWG) values in chickens, compared to a wheat-based diet. Nevertheless, sorghum-fed birds had higher feed conversion ratio (FCR) values than wheat-fed birds, possibly because of some anti-nutritional factors in sorghum. Further analyses showed that caecal microbial community was significantly associated with AME values, but microbiota composition differed between dietary treatments. A number of bacteria were individually correlated with growth performance measurements. Numerous OTUs assigned to strains of Lactobacillus crispatus and Lachnospiraceae, which were prevalent in sorghum-fed chickens, were correlated with high AME and BWG values, respectively. Additionally, a number of OTUs assigned to Clostridiales that were prevalent in wheat-fed chickens were correlated with low FCR values. Overall, these results suggest that between-diet variations in growth performance were partly associated with changes in the caecal microbiota."

"29506469","abstracttext_background","The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family is involved in signal transduction networks that underpin many different biological processes in plants, ranging from development to biotic and abiotic stress responses. To date this class of enzymes has received little attention in Triticeae species, which include important cereal crops (wheat, barley, rye and triticale) that represent over 20% of the total protein food-source worldwide."
"29506469","abstracttext_results","The work presented here focuses on two subfamilies of Triticeae MAPKs, the MAP kinases (MPKs), and the MAPK kinases (MKKs) whose members phosphorylate the MPKs. In silico analysis of multiple Triticeae sequence databases led to the identification of 152 MAPKs belonging to these two sub-families. Some previously identified MAPKs were renamed to reflect the literature consensus on MAPK nomenclature. Two novel MPKs, MPK24 and MPK25, have been identified, including the first example of a plant MPK carrying the TGY activation loop sequence common to mammalian p38 MPKs. An EF-hand calcium-binding domain was found in members of the Triticeae MPK17 clade, a feature that appears to be specific to Triticeae species. New insights into the novel MEY activation loop identified in MPK11s are offered. When the exon-intron patterns for some MPKs and MKKs of wheat, barley and ancestors of wheat were assembled based on transcript data in GenBank, they showed deviations from the same sequence predicted in Ensembl. The functional relevance of MAPKs as derived from patterns of gene expression, MPK activation and MKK-MPK interaction is discussed."

"28743037","abstracttext","Polyamines (PAs) can improve drought stress tolerance in plants; however, very limited information is available on the mechanism of action of exogenous application by different methods under drought stress in wheat. The present study investigates the mechanism through which seed priming and foliar spraying with PAs protect wheat plants from drought stress. 10 days old wheat seedlings were exposed to drought stress by withholding water alone or with 100 μM PAs solutions (putrescine, Put; spermine, Spm; and mixture of Put and Spm for 10 h seed-priming or three foliar sprays during withholding water. Drought stress impaired the wheat growth and altered the osmoprotectants, endogenous PAs levels, PAs biosynthetic genes expression and weight of 1000 grains compared to the corresponding control values. Exogenously applied PAs improved cell water status, accumulated osmoprotectants and PAs and up-regulated PAs biosynthetic genes, ADC, arginine decarboxylase; DHS, deoxyhypusine synthase; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase and SAMDC, S-adenosyl methionine decarboxylase. Put significantly regulate the endogenous PAs by both methods of application, however, Spm and mixture of Put and Spm could positively regulate the endogenous PAs and the biosynthetic gene expression by foliar spraying rather than seed priming. The data provide evidence that maintenance of water economy through stabilized cellular structure is an important strategy of drought tolerance by PAs in wheat."

"29653520","abstracttext_background","Bread wheat has a large complex genome that makes whole genome resequencing costly. Therefore, genome complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture make re-sequencing cost effective. With a high-quality draft wheat genome now available it is possible to design capture probe sets and to use them to accurately genotype and anchor SNPs to the genome. Furthermore, in addition to genetic variation, epigenetic variation provides a source of natural variation contributing to changes in gene expression and phenotype that can be profiled at the base pair level using sequence capture coupled with bisulphite treatment. Here, we present a new 12 Mbp wheat capture probe set, that allows both the profiling of genotype and methylation from the same DNA sample.

"29038661","articletitle","Assembly and Annotation of Transcriptome Provided Evidence of miRNA Mobility between Wheat and Wheat Stem Sawfly."
"29038661","abstracttext","Wheat Stem Sawfly (WSS), Cephus Cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), is one of the most important pests, causing yield and economic losses in wheat and barley. The lack of information about molecular mechanisms of WSS for defeating plant's resistance prevents application of effective pest control strategies therefore, it is essential to identify the genes and their regulators behind WSS infestations. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are recognized with their regulatory functions on gene expression, tuning protein production by controlling transcriptional and post-transcriptional activities. A transcriptome-guided approach was followed in order to identify miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNA of WSS, and their interaction networks. A total of 1,893 were presented here as differentially expressed between larva and adult WSS insects. There were 11 miRNA families detected in WSS transcriptome. Together with the annotation of 1,251 novel mRNAs, the amount of genetic information available for WSS was expanded. The network between WSS miRNAs, lncRNAs, and mRNAs suggested miRNA-mediated regulatory roles of lncRNAs as competing endogenous RNAs. In the light of the previous evidence that small RNA molecules of a pathogen could suppress the immune response of host plant, we analyzed the putative interactions between larvae and wheat at the miRNA level. Overall, this study provides a profile of larva and adult WSS life stages in terms of coding and non-coding elements. These findings also emphasize the potential roles of wheat and larval miRNAs in wheat resistance to infestation and in the suppression of resistance which is critical for the development of effective pest control strategies."
"28949040","articletitle","A modern Green Revolution gene for reduced height in wheat."
"28949040","abstracttext","Increases in the yield of wheat during the Green Revolution of the late 20 th century were achieved through the introduction of Reduced height (Rht) dwarfing genes. The Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 loci ensured short stature by limiting the response to the growth-promoting hormone gibberellin, and are now widespread through international breeding programs. Despite this advantage, interference with the plant's response to gibberellin also triggers adverse effects for a range of important agronomic traits, and consequently modern Green Revolution genes are urgently required. In this study, we revisited the genetic control of wheat height using an association mapping approach and a large panel of 1110 worldwide winter wheat cultivars. This led to the identification of a major Rht locus on chromosome 6A, Rht24, which substantially reduces plant height alone as well as in combination with Rht-1b alleles. Remarkably, behind Rht-D1, Rht24 was the second most important locus for reduced height, explaining 15.0% of the genotypic variance and exerting an allele substitution effect of -8.8 cm. Unlike the two Rht-1b alleles, plants carrying Rht24 remain sensitive to gibberellic acid treatment. Rht24 appears in breeding programs from all countries of origin investigated, with increased frequency over the last decades, indicating that wheat breeders have actively selected for this locus. Taken together, this study reveals Rht24 as an important Rht gene of commercial relevance in worldwide wheat breeding."

"29752764","abstracttext","Gliadins are a major component of wheat seed proteins. However, the complex homoeologous Gli-2 loci (Gli-A2, -B2 and -D2) that encode the α-gliadins in commercial wheat are still poorly understood. Here we analyzed the Gli-D2 locus of Xiaoyan 81 (Xy81), a winter wheat cultivar. A total of 421.091 kb of the Gli-D2 sequence was assembled from sequencing multiple bacterial artificial clones, and 10 α-gliadin genes were annotated. Comparative genomic analysis showed that Xy81 carried only eight of the α-gliadin genes of the D genome donor Aegilops tauschii, with two of them each experiencing a tandem duplication. A mutant line lacking Gli-D2 (DLGliD2) consistently exhibited better breadmaking quality and dough functionalities than its progenitor Xy81, but without penalties in other agronomic traits. It also had an elevated lysine content in the grains. Transcriptome analysis verified the lack of Gli-D2 α-gliadin gene expression in DLGliD2. Furthermore, the transcript and protein levels of protein disulfide isomerase were both upregulated in DLGliD2 grains. Consistent with this finding, DLGliD2 had increased disulfide content in the flour. Our work sheds light on the structure and function of Gli-D2 in commercial wheat, and suggests that the removal of Gli-D2 and the gliadins specified by it is likely to be useful for simultaneously enhancing the end-use and health-related traits of common wheat. Because gliadins and homologous proteins are widely present in grass species, the strategy and information reported here may be broadly useful for improving the quality traits of diverse cereal crops."

"29879411","abstracttext","An extensive bioinformatics based study has been performed to gain insight into the structural and functional aspects of candidate genes involved in Nitrogen and Phosphorus nutrition in wheat. Based on our study, 37 N and P nutrition candidate genes were identified (24 NUE and 13 inorganic phosphate transporters) in wheat genome. 23 gene specific novel microsatellites were discovered using genomic sequences of identified N and P nutrition genes. We also identified the microRNAs that target ten candidate genes including TaAS1-3A, TaAS1-3D, TaASN2-1A, TaASN2-1B, TaANR1-6A, TaANR1-6B, TaNRT2.4-6A, TaNRT2.6-6A, TaNRT2.6-6B and TaPHT1.5-5B. Expression profiling of identified genes showed altered expression under N and P starvation. The proposed 3D structure of wheat N and P nutrition proteins shared high level homology with known experimental structures providing information to understand their functions at the biochemical level. Molecular dynamics simulations of refined modeled structures of wheat N and P nutrition proteins show conformational stability. The identified N and P nutrition candidate genes and their targeting miRNAs may provide resources for the genetic improvement and promote N and P use efficiency. Our study provides first-hand structural prospective of N and P nutrition candidate genes towards development of wheat varieties resilient to N and P stress."

"30804930","abstracttext","Celiac Disease (CD) is a multifactorial, autoimmune enteropathy activated by cereal proteins in genetically predisposed individuals carrying HLA DQ2/8 genes. A heterogenous gene combination of the cereal prolamins is documented in different wheat genotypes, which is suggestive of their variable immunogenic potential. In the current study, four wheat varieties (C591, C273, 9D, and K78) identified via in silico analysis were analyzed for immunogenicity by measuring T-cell proliferation rate and levels of inflammatory cytokines (Interferon-γ and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α). Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells and biopsy derived T-cell lines isolated from four CD patients in complete remission and two controls were stimulated and cultured in the presence of tissue transglutaminase activated pepsin-trypsin (PT) digest of total gliadin extract from test varieties. The immunogenicity was compared with PBW 621, one of the widely cultivated wheat varieties. Phytohaemagglutinin-p was taken as positive control, along with unstimulated cells as negative control. Rate of cell proliferation (0.318, 0.482; 0.369, 0.337), concentration of IFN- γ (107.4, 99.2; 117.9, 99.7 pg/ml), and TNF- α (453.8, 514.2; 463.8, 514.2 pg/ml) was minimum in cultures supplemented with wheat antigen from C273, when compared with other test varieties and unstimulated cells. Significant difference in toxicity levels among different wheat genotypes to stimulate celiac mucosal T-cells and PBMC's was observed; where C273 manifested least immunogenic response amongst the test varieties analyzed."

"30769714","abstracttext","The stem rust resistance gene Sr24 is effective against most races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, including race TTKS (syn. Ug99), and is used widely in commercial wheat cultivars worldwide. In 2006, susceptible infection responses were observed on wheat lines and cultivars carrying Sr24 in a field stem rust screening nursery at Njoro, Kenya. We derived 28 single-pustule isolates from stem rust samples collected from the 2006 Njoro nursery. The isolates were evaluated for virulence on 16 North American stem rust differential lines; on wheat lines carrying Sr24, Sr31, Sr38, and SrMcN; and on a wheat cultivar with a combination of Sr24 and Sr31. All isolates were identified as race TTKS with additional virulence on Sr31 and Sr38. These isolates were divided into two groups: group A (seven isolates and the two control isolates), producing a low infection type, and group B (21 isolates), producing a high infection type on Sr24, respectively. Isolates of group B represented a new variant of race TTKS with virulence to Sr24. Eighteen simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to examine the genetic relationship between these two groups of isolates in race TTKS and five North American races (MCCF, QCCQ, RCRS, RTHS, and TPMK) that are representative of distinct lineage groups. All isolates of race TTKS shared an identical SSR genotype and were clearly different from North American races. The virulence and SSR data indicated that the new variant of race TTKS with Sr24 virulence likely has arisen via mutation within the TTKS genetic lineage. We propose to revise the North American stem rust nomenclature system by the addition of four genes (Sr24, Sr31, Sr38, and SrMcN) as the fifth set. This revision recognizes the virulence on Sr31 and differentiates isolates within race TTKS into two separate races: TTKSK and TTKST, with avirulence and virulence on Sr24, respectively. The occurrence of race TTKST with combined virulence on Sr24 and Sr31 has substantially increased the vulnerability of wheat to stem rust worldwide."

"32196335","abstracttext","Wheat bran is a major byproduct of the wheat industry and a rich source of cellulosic and hemicellulosic compounds. We developed a facile and reproducible method to generate functional nanomaterials from wheat bran derived polysaccharide, Arabinoxylan (AX). We first established that AX derived from wheat bran was chemically equivalent to commercially available AX extracted from wheat flour. Through facile chemical modification, positive and negatively charged domains were introduced along AX backbone, which in turn induced local electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions promoting the formation of nanoparticulate structures. The extracted, chemically modified AX was characterized using FTIR, 1 H NMR, and elemental analysis. We observed that, while both anionic and cationic AX self-assemble into stable, spherical nanoparticles with a low polydispersity index, the unmodified AX did not exhibit such self-organizational properties. To form functionally active nanomaterials, we further complexed negatively charged CRISPR-Cas9 DNA with cationic AX. Through gel electrophoretic studies, we identified that, at a feed ratio of DNA to AX of 1:15, AX is capable of forming polyplexes with DNA in the form of nanoparticles with an average hydrodynamic diameter of ∼100 nm and surface charge of -1.40 ± 0.91 mV. We envision that chemically modified AX, originally sourced from agricultural waste materials and not from food products, can be used as functional nanomaterials for gene delivery in the agrochemical sector thus catalyzing the circular approach of sustainability."

"32117410","abstracttext","Successful seedling establishment depends on the optimum depth of seed placement especially in drought-prone conditions, providing an opportunity to exploit subsoil water and increase winter survival in winter wheat. Coleoptile length is a key determinant for the appropriate depth at which seed can be sown. Thus, understanding the genetic basis of coleoptile length is necessary and important for wheat breeding. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using a diverse panel of 298 winter wheat genotypes to dissect the genetic architecture of coleoptile length. We identified nine genomic regions associated with the coleoptile length on seven different chromosomes. Of the nine genomic regions, five have been previously reported in various studies, including one mapped to previously known Rht-B1 region. Three novel quantitative trait loci (QTLs), QCL.sdsu-2AS , QCL.sdsu-4BL , and QCL.sdsu-5BL were identified in our study. QCL.sdsu-5BL has a large substitution effect which is comparable to Rht-B1 's effect and could be used to compensate for the negative effect of Rht-B1 on coleoptile length. In total, the nine QTLs explained 59% of the total phenotypic variation. Cultivars 'Agate' and 'MT06103' have the longest coleoptile length and interestingly, have favorable alleles at nine and eight coleoptile loci, respectively. These lines could be a valuable germplasm for longer coleoptile breeding. Gene annotations in the candidate regions revealed several putative proteins of specific interest including cytochrome P450-like, expansins, and phytochrome A. The QTLs for coleoptile length linked to single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers reported in this study could be employed in marker-assisted breeding for longer coleoptile in wheat. Thus, our study provides valuable insights into the genetic and molecular regulation of the coleoptile length in winter wheat."

"32296405","abstracttext","The influence of water and nitrogen (N) management on wheat have been investigated, but studies on the impact of long-term interactive water and N management on microbial structure and function are limited. Soil chemical properties and plants determine the soil microbial communities whose functions involved in nutrient cycling may affect plant productivity. There is an urgent need to elucidate the underlying mechanisms to optimize these microbial communities for agricultural sustainability in the winter wheat production area of the North China Plain. We performed high-throughput sequencing and quantitative PCR of the 16S rRNA gene on soil from a 7-year-old stationary field experiment to investigate the response of bacterial communities and function to water and N management. It was observed that water and N management significantly influenced wheat growth, soil properties and bacterial diversity. N application caused a significant decrease in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and both Richness and Shannon diversity indices, in the absence of irrigation. Irrigation led to an increase in the relative abundance of Planctomycetes, Latescibacteria, Anaerolineae, and Chloroflexia. In addition, most bacterial taxa were correlated with soil and plant properties. Some functions related to carbohydrate transport, transcription, inorganic ion transport and lipid transport were enriched in irrigation treatment, while N enriched predicted functions related to amino acid transport and metabolism, signal transduction, and cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis. Understanding the impact of N application and irrigation on the structure and function of soil bacteria is important for developing strategies for sustainable wheat production. Therefore, concurrent irrigation and N application may improve wheat yield and help to maintain those ecosystem functions that are driven by the soil microbial community."

"32300825","abstracttext_key message","Resistance to tan spot in durum wheat involves race-nonspecific QTL and necrotrophic insensitivity gene. Tan spot, caused by the necrotrophic fungus Pyrenophoratritici-repentis, is a major foliar disease on all cultivated wheat crops worldwide. Compared to common wheat, much less work has been done to investigate the genetic basis of tan spot resistance in durum. Here, we conducted disease evaluations, necrotrophic effector (NE) sensitivity assays and a genome-wide association study using a collection of durum accessions. The durum panel segregated for the reaction to disease inoculations and NE infiltrations with eighteen accessions being highly resistant to all races and most of them insensitive to both PtrToxA and PtrToxB. Over 65,000SNP markers were developed from genotyping-by-sequencing for the association mapping. As expected, sensitivity to PtrToxA and PtrToxB was mapped to the chromosome arms 5BL and 2BS, respectively. For the fungal inoculations, a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 3B was associated with resistance to all races and likely corresponds to the race-nonspecific resistance QTL previously identified in common wheat. The Tsn1locus was not significantly associated with tan spot caused by the PtrToxA-producing isolates Pti2 and 86-124, but the Tsc2 locus was significantly associated with tan spot caused by the PtrToxB-producing isolate DW5. Another QTL on chromosome arm 1AS was associated with tan spot caused by the PtrToxC-producing isolate Pti2 and likely corresponds to the Tsc1 locus. Additional QTL for specific races was identified on chromosome 1B and 3B. Our work highlights the complexity of genetic resistance to tan spot and further confirms that the Ptr ToxA-Tsn1 interaction plays no significant role in disease development in tetraploid wheat."

"32517065","abstracttext","Production of wheat-alien disomic addition lines is of great value to the exploitation and utilization of elite genes originated from related species to wheat. In this study, a novel wheat- Aegilops biuncialis 5M b disomic addition line WA317 was characterized by in situ hybridization (ISH) and specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) markers. Compared to its parent Chinese Spring (CS), the glumes of WA317 had black color and were difficult to remove after harvesting, suggesting chromosome 5M b carried gene(s) related to glume development and Triticeae domestication process. A total of 242 Ae. biuncialis SLAF-based markers (298 amplified patterns) were developed and further divided into four categories by Ae. biuncialis Y17, Ae. umbellulata Y139 and Ae. comosa Y258, including 172 markers amplifying the same bands of U and M genome, six and 102 markers amplifying U-specific and M-specific bands, respectively and eighteen markers amplifying specific bands in Y17. Among them, 45 markers had the specific amplifications in WA317 and were 5M b specific markers. Taken together, line WA317 with tenacious and black glumes should serve as the foundation for understanding of the Triticeae domestication process and further exploitation of primitive alleles for wheat improvement. Ae. biuncialis SLAF-based markers can be used for studying syntenic relationships between U and M genomes as well as rapid tracking of U and M chromosomal segments in wheat background."

The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential antagonistic activity of a bacterial consortium of three Chilean strains of Pseudomonas protegens against the wheat crown and root rot pathogens Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici , Rhizoctonia cerealis , and Fusarium culmorum . Two field experiments were carried out on artificially infested soil during two consecutive seasons (2016-2017 and 2017-2018) in an Andisol soil of southern Chile. Control treatments (not inoculated with fungi) were also included. Each treatment included a seed treatment of spring wheat cv. Pantera-INIA with and without the bacterial consortium. Both phytosanitary damage (incidence and severity) and agronomic components were evaluated. Bacterial populations with the phlD + gene in the wheat plant rhizosphere during anthesis state (Z6) were also quantified. In both seasons, infection severity decreased by an average of 16.8% in seeds treated with P. protegens consortium, while yield components such as spikes m -1 and number of grains per spike increased. The use of antagonistic bacteria resulted in a total yield increase only during the first experimental season (P < 0.05). In general, accumulated rainfall influenced the antagonistic effect of the consortium of P. protegens strains, accounting for the differences observed between the two seasons. The results suggest that this P. protegens consortium applied on seeds can promote plant growth and protect wheat crops against crown and root rot pathogens in Southern Chile under field conditions."

"30025220","abstracttext","Autophagy, a highly conserved intracellular degradation system, is regarded to be responsible for self-defense and protect cells from abiotic stress. Extensive studies have demonstrated that autophagy plays a crucial role in regulating plant growth and development as well as in response to diverse stresses. However, little is known about autophagy-associated genes (ATGs) in wheat, especially those involved in the regulatory network of stress processes. In this study, a total of 108 putative wheat ATGs (TaATG) were obtained based on a genome-wide search approach. Phylogenetic analysis classified them into 13 subfamilies, of which the TaAtg16 subfamily consisted of 29 members, ranking it the largest subfamily. The conserved motif compositions as well as their exon-intron structures were systematically analyzed and strongly supported the classification. The homoeologous genes tended to have similar gene features during wheat polyploidization. Furthermore, a total of 114 putative cis-elements were found, and those related to hormone, stress, and light responsiveness were abundantly presented in the promoter regions. Co-expression network analysis revealed that orthologous VAMP727 was the hub node of the whole network, and complex interactions were also found. Finally, the expression profiles of TaATGs among different tissues and under abiotic stresses were investigated to identify tissue-specific or stress-responsive candidates, and then 14 were validated by wet-lab analysis. Results showed that the TaAtg8 subfamily played a crucial role in tissue autophagy and stress defense, which could be considered as processes that are candidates for further functional study. This was the first study to comprehensively investigate the ATG family in wheat, which ultimately provided important clues for further functional analysis and also took a step toward uncovering the evolutionary mechanism of ATG genes in wheat and beyond."

"30606117","abstracttext_background","Wheat breeding over the last 100 years has increased productivity by adapting genotypes to local conditions, but the genomic changes and selection signals that caused phenotypic change during breeding are essentially unknown. Studying and understanding human selection of multiple important genes controlling key phenotypic traits will promote wheat molecular breeding."
"30606117","abstracttext_results","A total of 1152 diverse global wheat materials were genotyped based on KASP markers from 47 genes controlling grain yield, grain quality, adaptation, and stress resistance. Significant phenotypic variations between landraces and modern cultivars were found in 11 adaptive and yield-related traits. Thirty-six improvement-selective favorable alleles, including 22 positive prolonged and 14 negative selection alleles, were identified through comparing frequency spectra. Sus1-7A-Hap-H, Sus1-7B-Hap-T, Sus2-2A-Hap-A, TGW6-A1a, Cwi-4A-Hap-C, vrn-A1, PHS1-PHS+ and Lr34+ were subjected to strong selection, and overwhelmingly strong selection had occurred before improvement selection at Psy-A1b, Psy-B1a or b, Psy-D1a and Cwi-5D-Hap-C. However, Rht-B1b, Rht-D1b and 1BL.1RS were rare or absent in Chinese landraces but present in modern Chinese cultivars and introduced accessions. Importantly, Lr68+, Fhb1+, Wx-B1b and Yr15+, currently existing at a low frequency, should be regarded as further major improvement targets in global wheat breeding. Gene flow analysis showed that introduced cultivars especially from the former USSR and Italy contributed to enriched genetic variation in modern Chinese cultivars."

"30395610","abstracttext","Hidden underground, root systems constitute an important part of the plant for its development, nourishment and sensing the soil environment around it, but we know very little about its genetic regulation in crop plants like wheat. In the present study, we de novo assembled the root transcriptomes in reference cultivar Chinese Spring from RNA-seq reads generated by the 454-GS-FLX and HiSeq platforms. The FLX reads were assembled into 24,986 transcripts with completeness of 54.84%, and the HiSeq reads were assembled into 91,543 high-confidence protein-coding transcripts, 2,404 low-confidence protein-coding transcripts, and 13,181 non-coding transcripts with the completeness of >90%. Combining the FLX and HiSeq assemblies, we assembled a root transcriptome of 92,335 ORF-containing transcripts. Approximately 7% of the coding transcripts and ~2% non-coding transcripts are not present in the current wheat genome assembly. Functional annotation of both assemblies showed similar gene ontology patterns and that ~7% coding and >5% non-coding transcripts are root-specific. Transcription quantification identified 1,728 differentially expressed transcripts between root tips and maturation zone, and functional annotation of these transcripts captured a transcriptional signature of longitudinal development of wheat root. With the transcriptomic resources developed, this study provided the first view of wheat root transcriptome under different developmental zones and laid a foundation for molecular studies of wheat root development and growth using a reverse genetic approach."
"30392081","articletitle","Genetic and transcriptional variations in NRAMP-2 and OPAQUE1 genes are associated with salt stress response in wheat."
"30392081","abstracttext_key message","SNP alleles on chromosomes 4BL and 6AL are associated with sensitivity to salt tolerance in wheat and upon validation can be exploited in the development of salt-tolerant wheat varieties. The dissection of the genetic and molecular components of salt stress response offers strong opportunities toward understanding and improving salt tolerance in crops. In this study, GWAS was employed to identify a total of 106 SNP loci (R 2  = 0.12-63.44%) linked to salt stress response in wheat using leaf chlorophyll fluorescence, grain quality and shoot ionic (Na + and K + ions) attributes. Among them, 14 SNP loci individually conferred pleiotropic effects on multiple independent salinity tolerance traits including loci at 99.04 cM (R 2  ≥ 14.7%) and 68.45 cM (R 2  ≥ 4.10%) on chromosomes 6AL and 4BL, respectively, that influenced shoot Na + -uptake, shoot K + /Na + ratio, and specific energy fluxes for absorption (ABS/RC) and dissipation (DIo/RC). Analysis of the open reading frame (ORF) containing the SNP markers revealed that they are orthologous to genes involved in photosynthesis and plant stress (salt) response. Further transcript abundance and qRT-PCR analyses indicated that the genes are mostly up-regulated in salt-tolerant and down-regulated in salt-sensitive wheat genotypes including NRAMP-2 and OPAQUE1 genes on 4BL and 6AL, respectively. Both genes showed highest differential expression between contrasting genotypes when expressions of all the genes within their genetic intervals were analyzed. Possible cis-acting regulatory elements and coding sequence variation that may be involved in salt stress response were also identified in both genes. This study identified genetic and molecular components of salt stress response that are associated with Na + -uptake, shoot Na + /K + ratio, ABS/RC, DIo/RC, and grain quality traits and upon functional validation would facilitate the development of gene-specific markers that could be deployed to improve salinity tolerance in wheat."

"30812899","abstracttext","Collections of Puccinia triticina were obtained from rust-infected wheat leaves by cooperators throughout the United States and from surveys of wheat fields and nurseries in the Great Plains, Ohio Valley, Gulf Coast, California, Pacific Northwest, and Atlantic Coast States in order to determine the virulence of the wheat leaf rust fungus in 2001. Single uredinial isolates (477 in total) were derived from the wheat leaf rust collections and tested for virulence phenotype on lines of Thatcher wheat that are near-isogenic for leaf rust resistance genes Lr1, Lr2a, Lr2c, Lr3, Lr9, Lr16, Lr24, Lr26, Lr3ka, Lr11, Lr17, Lr30, LrB, Lr10, Lr14a, and Lr18. The isolates also were tested for virulence on adult plants with leaf rust resistance genes Lr12, Lr13, Lr22a, Lr22b, Lr34, Lr35, and Lr37. In the United States in 2001, 44 virulence phenotypes of P. triticina were found. Virulence phenotype MBDS, which is virulent to resistance gene Lr17, was the most common phenotype in the United States. MBDS was found in the Southeast, Great Plains, and Ohio Valley regions. Virulence phenotype THBJ, which is virulent to Lr16 and Lr26, was the second most common phenotype, and occurred almost exclusively in the north-central Great Plains region. Phenotype MCDS, which is virulent to Lr17 and Lr26, was the third most common phenotype and was found primarily in the Southeast, Ohio Valley, and Great Plains regions. The Southeast and Ohio Valley regions differed from the Great Plains region for predominant virulence phenotypes, which indicate that populations of P. triticina in those areas are not closely connected. The northern and southern areas of the Great Plains region differed for phenotypes with virulence to Lr16; however, the two areas had other phenotypes in common. Virulence to the adult plant resistance genes Lr35 and Lr37 was detected for the first time in North America in the MBDS, MCJS, and MCDS phenotypes."

"30800144","abstracttext","The general transcription repressor, TaDr1 gene, was identified during screening of a wheat SNP database using the Amplifluor-like SNP marker KATU-W62. Together with two genes described earlier, TaDr1A and TaDr1B , they represent a set of three homeologous genes in the wheat genome. Under drought, the total expression profiles of all three genes varied between different bread wheat cultivars. Plants of four high-yielding cultivars exposed to drought showed a 2.0-2.4-fold increase in TaDr1 expression compared to controls. Less strong, but significant 1.3-1.8-fold up-regulation of the TaDr1 transcript levels was observed in four low-yielding cultivars. TaVrn1 and TaFT1 , which controls the transition to flowering, revealed similar profiles of expression as TaDr1 . Expression levels of all three genes were in good correlation with grain yields of evaluated cultivars growing in the field under water-limited conditions. The results could indicate the involvement of all three genes in the same regulatory pathway, where the general transcription repressor TaDr1 may control expression of TaVrn1 and TaFT1 and, consequently, flowering time. The strength of these genes expression can lead to phenological changes that affect plant productivity and hence explain differences in the adaptation of the examined wheat cultivars to the dry environment of Northern and Central Kazakhstan. The Amplifluor-like SNP marker KATU-W62 used in this work can be applied to the identification of wheat cultivars differing in alleles at the TaDr1 locus and in screening hybrids."

"32397960","abstracttext_background","Most studies of crop salinity tolerance are conducted under short-term stress condition within one growth stage. Understanding of the mechanisms of crop response to long-term salinity stress (LSS) is valuable for achieving the improvement of crop salinity tolerance. In the current study, we exposed allohexaploid wheat seeds to LSS conditions from germination stage to young seedling stage for 30 days. To elucidate the adaptive strategy of allohexaploid wheat to LSS, we analyzed chloroplast ultrastructure, leaf anatomy, transcriptomic profiling and concentrations of plant hormones and organic compatible solutes, comparing stressed and control plants."
"32397960","abstracttext_results","Transcriptomic profiling and biochemical analysis showed that energy partitioning between general metabolism maintenance and stress response may be crucial for survival of allohexaploid wheat under LSS. Under LSS, wheat appeared to shift energy from general maintenance to stress response through stimulating the abscisic acid (ABA) pathway and suppressing gibberellin and jasmonic acid pathways in the leaf. We further distinguished the expression status of the A, B, and D homeologs of any gene triad, and also surveyed the effects of LSS on homeolog expression bias for salinity-tolerant triads. We found that LSS had similar effects on expression of the three homeologs for most salinity-tolerant triads. However, in some of these triads, LSS induced different effects on the expression of the three homeologs."

"30695931","abstracttext","Previous studies on the relationship of barberry (Berberis spp.) and wheat stem rust suggested that, although some barberry species can serve as alternate hosts for the stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, barberry plants play no role in wheat stem rust development and virulence variation of P. graminis f. sp. tritici in China. In the present study, severe rust infections on Berberis shensiana, B. brachypoda, B. potaninii, B. soulieana, and B. aggregata were observed during field surveys in 2011 and 2012. Through artificial inoculation of wheat seedlings ('Mingxian 169') under greenhouse conditions with aeciospores from naturally infected barberry plants, 185 isolates of P. graminis f. sp. tritici were obtained. From the 27 selected isolates that were tested on a set of wheat genotypes used to differentiate P. graminis f. sp. tritici races in China, 18 races were identified, of which 8 races were new and others were of Chinese 21 and 34 race groups. In addition to the information of virulence or avirulence patterns on the Chinese differentials, none of the races were virulent to resistance gene Sr31. The virulence frequencies based on individual Sr genes or differentials ranged from 0 to 96%. Using molecular markers for P. graminis f. sp. tritici, 75 of 4,036 samples of single aecia were identified as P. graminis f. sp. tritici. The low detectable rate of P. graminis f. sp. tritici was verified based on both infection and molecular marker tests. This observation may be correlated with the low levels of wheat stem rust in the surveyed regions. This study shows that P. graminis f. sp. tritici can produce new races through sexual reproduction on Berberis spp. in China."

Breeding wheat for FHB resistance contributes to increase yields and grain quality and to reduce the use of fungicides. The identification of genes and markers for FHB resistance in different wheat genotypes has nevertheless proven challenging."
"31795937","abstracttext_results","In this study, early infection by F. graminearum was analyzed in a doubled haploid population derived from the cross of the moderately resistant wheat genotypes Wuhan 1 and Nyubai. Three quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified: 1AL was associated with lower deoxynivalenol content, and 4BS and 5A were associated with reduced F. graminearum infection at 2 days post inoculation. Early resistance alleles were inherited from Wuhan 1 for QTL 1AL and 4BS and inherited from Nyubai for the 5A QTL. Cis and trans expression QTL (eQTL) were identified using RNA-seq data from infected head samples. Hotspots for trans eQTL were identified in the vicinity of the 1AL and 4BS QTL peaks. Among differentially expressed genes with cis eQTL within the QTL support intervals, nine genes had higher expression associated with FHB early resistance, and four genes had higher expression associated with FHB early susceptibility."

"31749777","articletitle","Early Root Transcriptomic Changes in Wheat Seedlings Colonized by Trichoderma harzianum Under Different Inorganic Nitrogen Supplies."
"31749777","abstracttext","Wheat is one of the most important crops worldwide. The use of plant growth promoting microorganisms, such as those of the genus Trichoderma , constitutes an alternative to chemical fertilizers, since they are cheaper and are not detrimental to the environment. However, the interaction between Trichoderma and wheat plants has been scarcely studied, at least at a molecular level. In the present work, a microarray approach was used to study the early transcriptomic changes induced in wheat roots by Trichoderma harzianum , applied alone or in combination with different concentrations of calcium nitrate [Ca(NO 3 ) 2 ], which was last used as nitrogen (N) source. Our results show that T. harzianum causes larger transcriptomic changes than Ca(NO 3 ) 2 in wheat roots, and such changes are different when plants are challenged with Trichoderma alone or treated with a combination of T. harzianum and Ca(NO 3 ) 2 . Overall, T. harzianum activates the expression of defense-related genes at early stages of the interaction with the roots, while this fungus reduces the expression of genes related to plant growth and development. Moreover, the current study in wheat roots, subjected to the different T. harzianum and Ca(NO 3 ) 2 combinations, reveals that the number of transcriptomic changes was higher when compared against those caused by the different Ca(NO 3 ) 2 concentrations than when it was compared against those caused by T. harzianum . N metabolism gene expression changes were in agreement with the levels of nitrate reductase activity measured in plants from Trichoderma plus Ca(NO 3 ) 2 conditions. Results were also concordant with plant phenotypes, which showed reduced growth at early interaction stages when inoculated with T. harzianum or with its combination with Ca(NO 3 ) 2 at the lowest dosage. These results were in a good agreement with the recognized role of Trichoderma as an inducer of plant defense."

"31183604","abstracttext_key message","Several classes of transcription factors are involved in the activation of defensins. A new type of the transcription factor responsible for the regulation of wheat grain specific defensins was characterised in this work. HD-Zip class IV transcription factors constitute a family of multidomain proteins. A full-length cDNA of HD-Zip IV, designated TaGL7 was isolated from the developing grain of bread wheat, using a specific DNA sequence as bait in the Y1H screen. 3D models of TaGL7 HD complexed with DNA cis-elements rationalised differences that underlined accommodations of binding and non-binding DNA, while the START-like domain model predicted binding of lipidic molecules inside a concave hydrophobic cavity. The 3'-untranslated region of TaGL7 was used as a probe to isolate the genomic clone of TdGL7 from a BAC library prepared from durum wheat. The spatial and temporal activity of the TdGL7 promoter was tested in transgenic wheat, barley and rice. TdGL7 was expressed mostly in ovary at fertilisation and its promoter was active in a liquid endosperm during cellularisation and later in the endosperm transfer cells, aleurone, and starchy endosperm. The pattern of TdGL7 expression resembled that of genes that encode grain-specific lipid transfer proteins, particularly defensins. In addition, GL7 expression was upregulated by mechanical wounding, similarly to defensin genes. Co-bombardment of cultured wheat cells with TdGL7 driven by constitutive promoter and seven grain or root specific defensin promoters fused to GUS gene, revealed activation of four promoters. The data confirmed the previously proposed role of HD-Zip IV transcription factors in the regulation of genes that encode lipid transfer proteins involved in lipid transport and defence. The TdGL7 promoter could be used to engineer cereal grains with enhanced resistance to insects and fungal infections."

"31338074","abstracttext","This study aimed to explore potential biocontrol mechanisms involved in the interference of antagonistic bacteria with fungal pathogenicity in planta . To do this, we conducted a comparative transcriptomic analysis of the ""take-all"" pathogenic fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici ( Ggt ) by examining Ggt -infected wheat roots in the presence or absence of the biocontrol agent Bacillus velezensis CC09 ( Bv ) compared with Ggt grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. A total of 4,134 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in Ggt -infected wheat roots, while 2,011 DEGs were detected in Bv + Ggt -infected roots, relative to the Ggt grown on PDA plates. Moreover, 31 DEGs were identified between wheat roots, respectively infected with Ggt and Bv + Ggt , consisting of 29 downregulated genes coding for potential Ggt pathogenicity factors - e.g., para-nitrobenzyl esterase, cutinase 1 and catalase-3, and two upregulated genes coding for tyrosinase and a hypothetical protein in the Bv + Ggt -infected roots when compared with the Ggt -infected roots. In particular, the expression of one gene, encoding the ABA3 involved in the production of Ggt 's hormone abscisic acid, was 4.11-fold lower in Ggt -infected roots with Bv than without Bv . This is the first experimental study to analyze the activity of Ggt transcriptomes in wheat roots exposed or not to a biocontrol bacterium. Our results therefore suggest the presence of Bv directly and/or indirectly impairs the pathogenicity of Ggt in wheat roots through complex regulatory mechanisms, such as hyphopodia formation, cell wall hydrolase, and expression of a papain inhibitor, among others, all which merit further investigation."
"31418639","articletitle","Population Genetics of Fusarium graminearum at the Interface of Wheat and Wild Grass Communities in New York."
"31418639","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is primarily understood as an agricultural pathogen affecting cereal crops, but its host range also includes diverse, noncultivated grasses ubiquitous across agricultural and natural environments. Wild grasses may select for the production of diverse toxin variants (chemotypes) and serve as reservoirs of genetic diversity or sources of disease-inciting inoculum. Populations at the intersection of wheat and wild grass communities were described using 909 isolates collected from wheat spikes, wild grass spikes, and overwintered wild grass stems found at natural and agricultural sites in regions of high and low crop production. Trichothecene (TRI) genotypes correlated to pathogen chemotype were predicted from two loci, and multilocus genotypes (MLGs) were determined using eight microsatellite loci. The genetic diversity of wild grass and wheat-derived populations was comparable, and their differentiation was low. Duplicate MLGs were rare even in samples collected from a single square meter, although they could be found in multiple hosts, environments, regions, and years. TRI genotype frequencies differed between region and land use. Admixture between TRI genotype-defined populations, which correspond to three previously described sympatric North American populations, was detected and was highest in a region with remote host communities and little agricultural production. Nonagricultural environments may maintain different pathogen TRI genotypes than wheat fields and provide an opportunity for recombination between isolates from different F. graminearum populations. A lack of structural barriers suggests that pathogen gene flow is uninhibited between wheat and wild grass communities, and the recovery of putative clones from multiple hosts and environments provides initial evidence that noncultivated grasses are a source of local and regional inoculum."

"31254025","abstracttext_key message","Exploring large genomic data sets based on the latest reference genome assembly identifies the rice ortholog APO1 as a key candidate gene for number of rachis nodes per spike in wheat. Increasing grain yield in wheat is a key breeding objective worldwide. Several component traits contribute to grain yield with spike attributes being among the most important. In this study, we performed a genome-wide association analysis for 12 grain yield and component traits measured in field trials with contrasting agrochemical input levels in a panel of 220 hexaploid winter wheats. A highly significant, environmentally consistent QTL was detected for number of rachis nodes per rachis (NRN) on chromosome 7AL. The five most significant SNPs formed a strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) block and tagged a 2.23 Mb region. Using pairwise LD for exome SNPs located across this interval in a large worldwide hexaploid wheat collection, we reduced the genomic region for NRN to a 258 Kb interval containing four of the original SNP and six high-confidence genes. The ortholog of one (TraesCS7A01G481600) of these genes in rice was ABBERANT PANICLE ORGANIZATION1 (APO1), which is known to have significant effects on panicle attributes. The APO1 ortholog was the best candidate for NRN and was associated with a 115 bp promoter deletion and two amino acid (C47F and D384 N) changes. Using a large worldwide collection of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, we found 12 haplotypes for the NRN QTL and evidence for positive enrichment of two haplotypes in modern germplasm. Comparison of five QTL haplotypes in Australian yield trials revealed their relative, context-dependent contribution to grain yield. Our study provides diagnostic SNPs and value propositions to support deployment of the NRN trait in wheat breeding."

"31435847","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) participate in multiple biological processes in plant. Cd accumulation ability differs among varieties in wheat, but little is known about miRNAs and their function in Cd accumulation of wheat under Cd stress. Therefore, the present study detected small RNAs responsible for differential Cd accumulation between two contrasting wheat genotypes (low-Cd accumulation one L17 and high-Cd accumulation one H17) to identify novel targets to further study Cd stress in wheat. Under normal conditions, 139 miRNAs were differentially expressed between L17 and H17, while this value reached 142 after Cd exposure. For Cd-induced DEMs, total 25 miRNAs were differentially expressed in L17 after Cd treatment, while, 70 Cd-induced DEMs were found in H17. Moreover, GO analysis revealed that target genes of DEMs related to lipid biosynthetic process and chlorophyll binding are uniquely enriched in L17, target genes of DEMs related to ribosome biogenesis and sucrose alpha-glucosidase activity are uniquely enriched in H17. By pathway analysis, target genes of DEMs related to PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was specifically enriched in L17, target genes of DEMs related to carbohydrate digestion and absorption pathway was uniquely enriched in H17. In addition, miRNA-gene co-expression showed that tae-miR9774 was uniquely expressed between L17Cd and L17CK, while tae-miR398 was specially expressed between H17Cd and H17CK. Our results suggested that Cd-accumulating ability of L17 and H17 varied from the expression of induced unique miRNA, such as expression of tae-miR-9774 and tae-miR-398. Our study not only provide the foundation for further exploring the miRNAs-induced molecular mechanisms of Cd accumulation in wheat but also supply novel strategies for improving phytoremediation ability of food plants through genetic engineering."

"31321476","abstracttext_key message","The review outlines past failures, present status and future prospects of hybrid wheat, and includes information on CMS/CHA/transgenic approaches for male sterility, heterotic groups and cost-effective hybrid seed production. Hybrid varieties give increased yield and improved grain quality in both cross- and self-pollinated crops. However, hybrid varieties in self-pollinated crops (particularly cereals) have not been very successful, except for hybrid rice in China. In case of hybrid wheat, despite the earlier failures, renewed efforts in recent years have been made and hybrid varieties with desirable attributes have been produced and marketed in some European countries. This review builds upon previous reviews, with a new outlook and improved knowledge base, not covered in earlier reviews. New technologies have been described, which include the Hordeum chilense-based CMS-fertility restorer system, chromosomal XYZ-4E-ms system and the following transgenic technologies: (1) conditional male sterility involving use of tapetum-specific expression of a gene that converts a pro-toxin into a phytotoxin causing male sterility; (2) barnase-barstar SeedLink system of Bayer CropScience; (3) split-barnase system that obviates the need of a barstar-based male restorer line; and (4) seed production technology of DuPont-Pioneer that makes use of transgenes in production of male-sterile lines, but gives hybrid seed with no transgenes. This review also includes a brief account of studies for discovery of heterotic QTL, genomic prediction of hybrid vigour and the development of heterotic groups/patterns and their importance in hybrid wheat production. The problem of high cost of hybrid seed due to required high seed rate in wheat relative to hybrid rice has also been addressed. The review concludes with a brief account of the current efforts and future possibilities in making hybrid wheat a commercial success."

"33133029","abstracttext","The emergence of new physiological races of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) causing wheat stripe rust can lead to the loss of resistance of wheat cultivars to stripe rust, thus resulting in severe losses in wheat yield. In this study, after the germination of urediospores of three Pst strains including the original strain (CYR32, a dominant physiological race of Pst in China) and two virulence-mutant strains (CYR32-5 and CYR32-61) acquired from CYR32 via UV-B radiation, proteomic analysis based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) technology was performed on the strains. A total of 2,271 proteins were identified, and 59, 74, and 64 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were acquired in CYR32-5 vs. CYR32, CYR32-61 vs. CYR32, and CYR32-61 vs. CYR32-5, respectively. The acquired DEPs were mainly involved in energy metabolism, carbon metabolism, and cellular substance synthesis. Furthermore, quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays were used to determine the relative expression of the 6, 7, and 1 DEPs of CYR32-5 vs. CYR32, CYR32-61 vs. CYR32, and CYR32-61 vs. CYR32-5, respectively, at the transcriptional level. The relative expression levels of one, five, and one gene, respectively, encoding the DEPs, were consistent with the corresponding protein abundance determined by iTRAQ technology. Compared with CYR32, the DEPs associated with energy metabolism and stress-including E3JWK6, F4S0Z3, and A8N2Q4-were up-regulated in the mutant strains. The results indicated that the virulence-mutant strains CYR32-5 and CYR32-61 had more tolerance to stress than the original strain CYR32. The results obtained in this study are of great significance for exploring the virulence variation mechanisms of Pst , monitoring the changes in Pst populations, breeding new disease-resistant wheat cultivars, and managing wheat stripe rust sustainably."

"32706317","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease of wheat, causing yield losses and quality reduction due to mycotoxin production. In this study, iTRAQ (isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification)-labeling based mass spectrometry (MS) was employed to characterize the proteome in wheat cultivars Xinong 538 and Zhoumai 18 with contrasting levels of FHB-resistance as a means to elucidate the molecular mechanisms contributing to FHB-resistance. A total of 13,669 proteins were identified in the two cultivars 48 hours after F. graminearum inoculation. Among these, 2,505 unique proteins exclusively accumulated in Xinong 538 (resistant) and 887 proteins in Zhoumai 18 (susceptible). Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that most differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) from both cultivars were assigned to categories 'metabolic process', 'cellular process', and 'response to stimulus'. KEGG analysis showed that a greater number of proteins belonging to different metabolic pathways were identified in Xinong 538 compared to Zhoumai 18. Specifically, DAPs from the FHB-resistant cultivar Xinong 538 populated categories of metabolic pathways related to plant-pathogen interaction. These DAPs might play a critical role in defense responses exhibited by Xinong 538. DAPs were assigned to wheat chromosomes, with approximately 30% mapping to wheat chromosomes 2B, 3B, 5B, and 5D. Twenty SNP markers, flanking DAPs on chromosomes 1B, 3B, 5B, and 6A overlapped with the location of earlier mapped FHB-resistance QTLs. The data provide evidence for the involvement of a number of DAPs in the early stages of the FHB-resistance response in wheat, with further functional characterization of candidate proteins warranted."

"32725154","abstracttext","Improved inorganic phosphate (Pi) use efficiency in crops will be important for sustainable agriculture. Exploring molecular mechanisms that regulate Pi uptake could provide useful information for breeding wheat with improved Pi use efficiency. Here, a TaPHR3-A1 (Gene ID: TraesCS7A02G415800) ortholog of rice OsPHR3 that functions in transcriptional regulation of Pi signaling was cloned from wheat chromosome 7A. Ectopic expression of TaPHR3-A1 in Arabidopsis and rice produced enhanced vegetative growth and more seeds. Overexpression in transgenic rice led to increased biomass, grain number, and primary panicle branching by 61.23, 42.12, and 36.34% compared with the wild type. Transgenic wheat lines with down-regulation of TaPHR3-A1 exhibited retarded growth and root hair development at the seedling stage, and showed yield-related effects at the adult stage when grown in both low- and sufficient Pi conditions, indicating that TaPHR3-A1 positively regulated tolerance to low Pi. Introgression lines further confirmed the effect of TaPHR3-A1 in improving grain number. The Chinese wheat mini core collection and a recombinant inbred line analysis demonstrated that the favorable allele TaPHR3-A1-A associated with higher grain number was positively selected in breeding. A TaPHR3-A1-derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker effectively identified haplotype TaPHR3-A1-A. Our results suggested that TaPHR3-A1 was a functional regulatory factor for Pi uptake and provided useful information for marker-assisted selection for high yield in wheat."

"32825615","abstracttext","Water-deficit and heat stress negatively impact crop production. Mechanisms underlying the response of durum wheat to such stresses are not well understood. With the new durum wheat genome assembly, we conducted the first multi-omics analysis with next-generation sequencing, providing a comprehensive description of the durum wheat small RNAome (sRNAome), mRNA transcriptome, and degradome. Single and combined water-deficit and heat stress were applied to stress-tolerant and -sensitive Australian genotypes to study their response at multiple time-points during reproduction. Analysis of 120 sRNA libraries identified 523 microRNAs (miRNAs), of which 55 were novel. Differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were identified that had significantly altered expression subject to stress type, genotype, and time-point. Transcriptome sequencing identified 49,436 genes, with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) linked to processes associated with hormone homeostasis, photosynthesis, and signaling. With the first durum wheat degradome report, over 100,000 transcript target sites were characterized, and new miRNA-mRNA regulatory pairs were discovered. Integrated omics analysis identified key miRNA-mRNA modules (particularly, novel pairs of miRNAs and transcription factors) with antagonistic regulatory patterns subject to different stresses. GO (Gene Ontology) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) enrichment analysis revealed significant roles in plant growth and stress adaptation. Our research provides novel and fundamental knowledge, at the whole-genome level, for transcriptional and post-transcriptional stress regulation in durum wheat."

"33097348","abstracttext","Soil copper (Cu) pollution severely stunts crops growth and limits sustainable agri-food production. Many microbes are widely used for remediation of polluted soil, including Cu pollution. In this study, the potential of an endophytic Bacillus altitudinis WR10 to protect wheat from Cu stress and the molecular mechanisms were investigated using hydroponic model. The Cu resistance assay showed B. altitudinis WR10 can resist up to 2 mM Cu and remove about 74% Cu in medium after 24 h of fermentation. Co-culture study demonstrated WR10 increased roots length and dry weight in wheat seedlings under 50 μM Cu. These results indicated that WR10 was a Cu-resistant strain and reduced Cu toxicity in wheat. Transcriptome data and biochemical tests of wheat roots indicated that WR10 alleviated Cu toxicity through enhancing peroxidases (PODs) gene expression and activity to remove excess hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) and down-regulating glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) to increase glutathione (GSH) level. Moreover, enrichment and pathway analysis indicated WR10 regulated the expression of genes involved in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, which may improve phenolic acids accumulation for protecting plant cells from Cu toxicity. Overall, this study revealed that B. altitudinis WR10 alleviated Cu toxicity in wheat via augmenting reactive oxygen species scavenging and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis."

"33050878","abstracttext_background","Plant height is an important wheat trait that is regulated by multiple genes, among which Rht is of the utmost value. In wheat, Rht-B1p (=Rht17) is a mutant allele of the Rht gene that encodes for a DELLA-protein and results in the development of gibberellin-insensitive plants with a dwarfing phenotype. The pleiotropic effects of dwarfing genes on yield are highly dependent on both the genetic background and the environmental conditions. In Russia, the Central Non-Black Earth Region and Krasnodar Krai are two economically important regions that require differing management for sustainable wheat production for food, feed and industry. The purpose of our study was to compare the pleiotropic effects of Rht-B1p on the main valuable agronomic traits in the F 3:4 families of the spring bread wheat Chris Mutant/Novosibirskaya 67 in the genetic background of Vrn-B1a/vrn-B1 (spring/winter phenotype) and Ppd-D1a/Ppd-D1b (insensitivity/sensitivity to photoperiod) alleles in a field experiment in Moscow and Krasnodar Krai."
"33050878","abstracttext_results","Plant height was reduced on average by 21 cm (28%) and 25 cm (30%), respectively; Ppd-D1a slightly strengthened the dwarfing effect in Moscow and mitigated it in Krasnodar Krai. Grain weight of the main spike was reduced by Rht-B1p in Moscow and to lesser extent in Krasnodar; Ppd-D1a and Vrn-B1a tended to partially compensate for this loss in Krasnodar Krai. Thousand grain weight was reduced on average by 5.3 g (16%) and 2.9 g (10%) in Moscow and Krasnodar Krai, respectively, but was partially compensated for by Ppd-D1a in Krasnodar Krai. Harvest index was increased due to Rht-B1p by 6 and 10% in Moscow and Krasnodar Krai, respectively. Rht-B1p resulted in a delay of heading by 1-2 days in Moscow. Ppd-D1a accelerated heading by 1 day and 6 days in Moscow and in Krasnodar Krai, respectively."
"33050878","abstracttext_conclusions","Rht-B1p could be introduced into wheat breeding along with dwarfing genes such as Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b. Special attention should be paid to its combination with Ppd-D1a and Vrn-B1a as regulators of developmental rates, compensators of adverse effects of Rht-B1p on productivity and enhancers of positive effect of Rht-B1p on harvest index."

"33281855","abstracttext","Stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) is a global concern for wheat production. Spring wheat cultivar PI 197734, of Sweden origin, has shown high-temperature adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust for many years. To map resistance quantitative trait loci (QTL), 178 doubled haploid lines were developed from a cross of PI 197734 with susceptible AvS. The DH lines and parents were tested in fields in 2017 and 2018 under natural infection of Pst and genotyped with genotyping by multiplexed sequencing (GMS). Kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers from specific chromosomal regions were also used to genotype the population to validate and saturate resistance QTL regions. Two major QTL on chromosomes 1AL and 3BL and one minor QTL on 2AL were identified. The two major QTL, QYrPI197734.wgp-1A and QYrPI197734.wgp-3B , were detected in all tested environments explaining up to 20.7 and 46.8% phenotypic variation, respectively. An awnletted gene mapped to the expected distal end of chromosome 5AL indicated the accuracy of linkage mapping. The KASP markers converted from the GMS-SNPs in the 1A and 3B QTL regions were used to genotype 95 US spring wheat cultivars and breeding lines, and they individually showed different percentages of polymorphisms. The haplotypes of the three markers for the 1A QTL and four markers for the 3B QTL identified 37.9 and 21.1% of the wheat cultivar/breeding lines possibly carrying these two QTL, indicating their usefulness in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for incorporating the two major QTL into new wheat cultivars."

"28536593","abstracttext","Cystatin is a class of proteins mainly involved in cysteine protease inhibition and plant growth and development, as well as tolerance under various abiotic stresses. In this study, we performed the first comprehensive analysis of the molecular characterization and expression profiling in response to various abiotic stresses of the cystatin gene family in Brachypodium distachyon , a novel model plant for Triticum species with huge genomes. Comprehensive searches of the Brachypodium genome database identified 25 B. distachyon cystatin ( BdC ) genes that are distributed unevenly on chromosomes; of these, nine and two were involved in tandem and segmental duplication events, respectively. All BdC genes had similar exon/intron structural organization, with three conserved motifs similar to those from other plant species, indicating their high evolutionary conservation. Expression profiling of 10 typical BdC genes revealed ubiquitous expression in different organs at varying expression levels. BdC gene expression in seedling leaves was particularly highly induced by various abiotic stresses, including the plant hormone abscisic acid and various environmental cues (cold, H 2 O 2 , CdCl 2 , salt, and drought). Interestingly, most BdC genes were significantly upregulated under multiple abiotic stresses, including BdC15 under all stresses, BdC7-2 and BdC10 under five stresses, and BdC7-1, BdC2-1, BdC14 , and BdC12 under four stresses. The putative metabolic pathways of cytastin genes in response to various abiotic stresses mainly involve the aberrant protein degradation pathway and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-triggered programmed cell death signaling pathways. These observations provide a better understanding of the structural and functional characteristics of the plant cystatin gene family."
"15692854","articletitle","Wheat cultivar-specific selection of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol-producing fluorescent Pseudomonas species from resident soil populations."
"15692854","abstracttext","An emerging body of evidence indicates a role for plant genotype as a determinant of the species and genetic composition of the saprophytic microbial community resident to the rhizosphere. In this study, experiments were conducted to determine the capacity of five different wheat cultivars to enhance resident populations and support introduced strains of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG)-producing fluorescent pseudomonads, a group of bacteria known to provide biological control of several soilborne diseases. When soils were cropped with three successive 28-day growth cycles of wheat, the 2,4-DAPG-producing strains were consistently recovered from the rhizosphere of the cultivar Lewjain, and commonly were present at populations higher than those recovered from other wheat cultivars. Based on restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analyses of phlD, a key gene involved in 2,4-DAPG production, two previously undefined phlD+ genotypes, referred to as genotypes PfZ and PfY, were discovered. Wheat cultivar Lewjain was the primary source of genotype PfY while cultivar Penawawa yielded the majority of genotype PfZ. Based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis, both new phlD genotypes were classified as P. fluorescens. Comparison of the rhizosphere competence of 2,4-DAPG-producing P. fluorescens Q2-87 (genotype B) and P. fluorescens LR3-A28 (genotype PfY) showed that both strains persisted at similar populations in the rhizosphere of all cultivars tested over a 30 day period when introduced as a seed inoculant. However, when strain LR3-A28 was applied as a soil inoculant, this strain was recovered at higher populations from the rhizosphere of wheat cultivar Lewjain than from the rhizospheres of two other cultivars. No cultivar effects were shown for strain Q2-87. Collectively, these results add further to evidence indicating a degree of specificity in interactions between plant cultivars and specific members of the saprophytic microbial community. Furthermore, as 2,4-DAPG-producing fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. have a central role in the spontaneous reduction in severity of take-all disease of wheat in response to continuous wheat monoculture, we postulate that the use of specific cultivars, such as Lewjain, which possess a superior capacity to enhance resident soil populations of these bacteria may have potential to reduce the length of the monoculture period required to induce natural suppressiveness of soils toward this disease."

"22781579","abstracttext","Quantitative real-time PCR assays, based on polymorphisms in the TRI12 gene of the trichothecene pathway, were developed to identify and quantify the trichothecene genotypes producing 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3ADON), 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15ADON) or nivalenol (NIV) in the Fusarium graminearum species complex, Fusarium culmorum, Fusarium cerealis and Fusarium pseudograminearum. These assays were applied on a total of 378 field samples of cereal grain of wheat, barley, triticale, rye and oats collected from 2003 to 2007 to study the trichothecene genotype composition in Danish cereals. The three genotypes, 3ADON, 15ADON and NIV were found in all five cereal species, great annual variation in the occurrence of the trichothecene genotypes was evident with considerable variation between the samples. 3ADON was the dominant genotype in barley, triticale, rye and oats while 15ADON was most dominant in wheat. The NIV genotype was found at low levels in most samples. Study of genotype composition within the Danish F. graminearum and F. culmorum population was based on principal component analysis (PCA). PCA revealed that the dominating genotype of F. graminearum in wheat is 15ADON. For barley, the PCA analysis indicated that the F. graminearum population consisted of all three genotypes, and in triticale, the F. graminearum population consisted mainly of 15ADON genotype. F. culmorum/F. cerealis showed correlation to the NIV genotype in wheat and triticale but not in barley. F. culmorum/F. cerealis also showed some correlation to 3ADON especially in wheat and triticale. Selected wheat and barley samples from 1957 to 2000 showed low amounts of F. graminearum and F. culmorum in general but with a dominance of the 3ADON genotype. 15ADON was not detected in these samples, except for very low amounts in the sample representing the years from 1997 to 2000. Detection of low amounts of the 15ADON genotype in these historical samples and the relatively high amounts of 15ADON genotype in 2003 and following years correspond well with the occurrence of F. graminearum and indicates that the 15ADON genotype was introduced along with F. graminearum around 2000. The amounts of the 3ADON and 15ADON genotypes correlated well with the total amount of DON whereas the amounts of NIV genotype correlated well with the amount of NIV in wheat and triticale but not in barley where the results indicate that Fusarium poae may also contribute to the NIV content."
"30780777","articletitle","First Report of Soilborne wheat mosaic virus on Wheat (Triticum aestivum) in the Columbia Basin of Oregon."
"30780777","abstracttext","The Columbia Basin of Oregon consists of six counties (Gilliam, Hood River, Morrow, Sherman, Wasco, and Umatilla) and is the major wheat-producing region in the state. In 2005, these counties produced 300,277 ha of mostly fall-planted wheat. While primarily a dryland production area, wheat (approximately 8,094 ha) is also grown as a rotational crop under irrigation. Stunted and chlorotic winter wheat plants with leaves exhibiting a mosaic pattern consistent with that caused by Soilborne wheat mosaic virus (SBWMV) were observed in March 2005. These plants originated from four center-pivot irrigated fields in Umatilla County with each field approximately 50.6 ha. One-half of one field was planted with cv. Western Breeders 470 (WB470) and the other half with cv. Tubbs, while the three other fields were planted to Tubbs. In the split-planted field, symptoms were widespread in the WB470 half but only observed in low-lying areas planted with Tubbs. ELISA with a monoclonal antibody (Agdia Inc., Elkhart, IN) confirmed the presence of SBWMV, which is transmitted by the soilborne organism Polymyxa graminis. Electron microscopy confirmed rigid, rod-shaped particles that were 19 nm wide and of two size classes, 138 to 222 and 416 to 471 nm long. Presence of SBWMV was further verified by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR using SBWMV RNA-2 specific primers (sense 5'-AAAGAGTCTIGCGTRTARCAYTC-3' and antisense 5'-AACGGTGTTAGTAARYTRGGKGA-3'), which amplified the predicted 338-bp product from the coat protein gene (1). Additional positive samples were found in 2006 from fall-planted wheat cvs. WB 528 and MJ9 from two additional 50.6-ha fields in Umatilla County. In 2005, yield of WB470 in the split-planted field was reduced by approximately 15% compared with yields obtained in similar fields planted with WB470 not exhibiting symptoms. SBWMV has been reported previously in Oregon (2) but nearly 322 km to the west in an area that is not the major wheat-producing region in Oregon. Because of the apparent reduced susceptibility of Tubbs, which is an older cultivar, as compared with WB470, WB528, and MJ9, which are three new high-yielding cultivars, additional research is needed to identify the reaction to SBWMV of cultivars adapted for production in the Pacific Northwest, particularly if this disease becomes widely distributed in both irrigated and dryland production areas.

The wheat RHT-B1b and RHT-D1b semi-dwarfing alleles, which encode GA-insensitive DELLA proteins, have been widely adopted in modern wheat varieties to improve lodging tolerance and harvest index. However, the molecular mechanisms by which DELLA modulates these responses in wheat remain largely unknown."
"30348083","abstracttext_results","We identified a tall tetraploid wheat mutant line carrying an induced missense mutation (E529K) in the PFYRE motif of RHT-B1b that partially suppressed the semi-dwarf phenotype. The height-increasing effect of RHT-B1b E529K relative to RHT-B1b (19 cm or 21% increase) was significantly smaller than the effect of RHT-B1a (33 cm or 34% increase) relative to RHT-B1b in the same field experiment. The RHT-B1b E529K mutation was also associated with length increases in coleoptiles, seedling shoots, and stem internodes relative to the RHT-B1b allele. We detected no significant differences in germination rate, seedling root length, tiller number, flag leaf size, spike length, or yield components. Using RNA-seq, we compared gene expression profiles of plants encoding RHT-B1b and RHT-B1b E529K in coleoptile, first leaf, and elongating peduncles. We detected limited overlap among tissues of the genes differentially regulated by the two genotypes, and more genes upregulated (77%) than downregulated (23%) in RHT-B1b E529K relative to RHT-B1b. These results suggest that the wheat DELLA protein affects the transcriptome in a tissue-specific manner and that the mutation mainly eliminates or reduces repression functions of the RHT-B1 protein. Our study identified distinct sets of potential DELLA direct or indirect target genes involved in cell wall and carbohydrate metabolisms, cell cycle/division, and hormone pathways."
"30348083","abstracttext_conclusions","We identified the hypomorphic RHT-B1b E529K allele that confers an intermediate plant height and coleoptile elongation.

Transcriptomic characterization of different tissues from the plants encoding RHT-B1b E529K and RHT-B1b provided valuable information for identifying DELLA downstream GA response genes in wheat."
"15490099","articletitle","Molecular mapping of Stb1, a potentially durable gene for resistance to septoria tritici blotch in wheat."
"15490099","abstracttext","Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by the ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola (anamorph Septoria tritici), was the most destructive disease of wheat in Indiana and adjacent states before deployment of the resistance gene Stb1 during the early 1970s. Since then, Stb1 has provided durable protection against STB in widely grown wheat cultivars. However, its chromosomal location and allelic relationships to most other STB genes are not known, so the molecular mapping of Stb1 is of great interest. Genetic analyses and molecular mapping were performed for two mapping populations. A total of 148 F1 plants (mapping population I) were derived from a three-way cross between the resistant line P881072-75-1 and the susceptible lines P881072-75-2 and Monon, and 106 F6 recombinant-inbred lines (mapping population II) were developed from a cross between the resistant line 72626E2-12-9-1 and the susceptible cultivar Arthur. Bulked-segregant analysis with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and microsatellite or simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers was conducted to identify those that were putatively linked to the Stb1 gene. Segregation analyses confirmed that a single dominant gene controls the resistance to M. graminicola in each mapping population. Two RAPD markers, G7(1200) and H19(520), were tightly linked to Stb1 in wheat line P881072-75-1 at distances of less than 0.68 cM and 1.4 cM, respectively. In mapping population II, the most closely linked marker was SSR Xbarc74, which was 2.8 cM proximal to Stb1 on chromosome 5BL. Microsatellite loci Xgwm335 and Xgwm213 also were proximal to Stb1 at distances of 7.4 cM and 8.3 cM, respectively. The flanking AFLP marker, EcoRI-AGC/ MseI-CTA-1, was 8.4 cM distal to Stb1. The two RAPD markers, G7(1200) and H19(520), and AFLP EcoRI-AGC/ MseI-CTA-1, were cloned and sequenced for conversion into sequence-characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers. Only RAPD allele H19(520) could be converted successfully, and none of the SCAR markers was diagnostic for the Stb1 locus. Analysis of SSR and the original RAPD primers on several 5BL deletion stocks positioned the Stb1 locus in the region delineated by chromosome breakpoints at fraction lengths 0.59 and 0.75. The molecular markers tightly linked to Stb1 could be useful for marker-assisted selection and for pyramiding of Stb1 with other genes for resistance to M. graminicola in wheat."
"22436186","articletitle","Fusarium mycotoxin-contaminated wheat containing deoxynivalenol alters the gene expression in the liver and the jejunum of broilers."
"22436186","abstracttext","The effects of mycotoxins in the production of animal feed were investigated using broiler chickens. For the feeding trial, naturally Fusarium mycotoxin-contaminated wheat was used, which mainly contained deoxynivalenol (DON). The main effects of DON are reduction of the feed intake and reduced weight gain of broilers. At the molecular level, DON binds to the 60 S ribosomal subunit and subsequently inhibits protein synthesis at the translational level. However, little is known about other effects of DON, for example, at the transcriptional level. Therefore, a microarray analysis was performed, which allows the investigation of thousands of transcripts in one experiment. In the experiment, 20 broilers were separated into four groups of five broilers each at day 1 after hatching. The diets consisted of a control diet and three diets with calculated, moderate concentrations of 1.0, 2.5 and 5.0 mg DON/kg feed, which was attained by exchanging uncontaminated wheat with naturally mycotoxin-contaminated wheat up to the intended DON concentration. The broilers were held at standard conditions for 23 days. Three microarrays were used per group to determine the significant alterations of the gene expression in the liver (P < 0.05), and qPCR was performed on the liver and the jejunum to verify the results. No significant difference in BW, feed intake or feed conversion rate was observed. The nutrient uptake into the hepatic and jejunal cells seemed to be influenced by genes: SLC2A5 (fc: -1.54, DON2.5), which facilitates glucose and fructose transport and SLC7A10 (fc: +1.49, DON5), a transporter of d-serine and other neutral amino acids. In the jejunum, the palmitate transport might be altered by SLC27A4 (fc: -1.87, DON5) and monocarboxylates uptake by SLC16A1 (fc: -1.47, DON5). The alterations of the SLC gene expression may explain the reduced weight gain of broilers chronically exposed to DON-contaminated wheat. The decreased expressions of EIF2AK3 (fc: -1.29, DON2.5/5) and DNAJC3 (fc: -1.44, DON2.5) seem to be related to the translation inhibition. The binding of DON to the 60 S ribosomal subunit and the subsequent translation inhibition might be counterbalanced by the downregulation of EIF2AK3 and DNAJC3. The genes PARP1, MPG, EME1, XPAC, RIF1 and CHAF1B are mainly related to single-strand DNA modifications and showed an increased expression in the group with 5 mg DON/kg feed. The results indicate that significantly altered gene expression was already occurring at 2.5 mg DON/kg feed."
"25084303","articletitle","Genetic Characterization of Resistance to Wheat Stem Rust Race TTKSK in Landrace and Wild Barley Accessions Identifies the rpg4/Rpg5 Locus."
"25084303","abstracttext","Race TTKSK of the wheat stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici) threatens the production of wheat and barley worldwide because of its broad-spectrum virulence on many widely grown cultivars. Sources of resistance against race TTKSK were recently identified in several barley landraces (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare) and wild barley accessions (H. vulgare subsp. spontaneum). The objectives of this study were to characterize the inheritance of resistance to wheat stem rust race TTKSK in four barley landraces (Hv501, Hv545, Hv602, and Hv612) and two wild barley (WBDC213 and WBDC345) accessions, map the resistance genes, and determine the allelic relationships among the genes in these accessions and the previously described rpg4/Rpg5 locus. Resistant accessions were crossed with the susceptible cv. Steptoe and resulting F3 populations were evaluated for resistance to race TTKSK at the seedling stage. Segregation of F3 families in populations involving the resistance sources of Hv501, Hv545, Hv612, WBDC213, and WBDC345 fit a 1:2:1 ratio for homozygous resistant (HR)/segregating (SEG)/homozygous susceptible (HS) progenies (with χ2=2.27 to 5.87 and P=0.053 to 0.321), indicating that a single gene confers resistance to race TTKSK. Segregation of F3 families in cross Steptoe/Hv602 did not fit a 1:2:1 ratio (HR/SEG/HS of 20:47:43 with χ2=11.95 and P=0.003), indicating that more than one gene is involved in imparting resistance to race TTKSK. Bulked segregant analysis using >1,500 single-nucleotide polymorphism markers positioned a resistance locus in all six populations on chromosome 5HL in very close proximity to the known location of the rpg4/Rpg5 complex locus. Allelism tests were conducted by making crosses among resistant accessions Hv501, Hv545, and Hv612 and also Q21861 with the rpg4/Rpg5 complex. No segregation was observed in F2 families inoculated with race TTKSK, demonstrating that all Hv lines carry the same allele for resistance and that it resides at or very near the rpg4/Rpg5 locus. Phenotype evaluations of the six barley accessions with wheat stem rust race QCCJ revealed resistant infection types (ITs) at a low incubation temperature and susceptible ITs at a high incubation temperature, similar to Q21861, which carries the temperature-sensitive gene rpg4. The accessions also exhibited low ITs against the rye stem rust isolate 92-MN-90, suggesting that they also carry Rpg5. This result was confirmed through molecular analysis, which revealed that all six barley accessions contain the serine threonine protein kinase domain that confers Rpg5 resistance. These results indicate that cultivated barley is extremely vulnerable to African stem rust races such as TTKSK because even these diverse selections of landrace and wild barley accessions carry only one locus for resistance."

"15905991","abstracttext","Using a set of 21 substitution lines of Triticum macha in a 'Hobbit Sib' background, it was previously demonstrated that chromosome 4A of T. macha carries significant resistance to Fusarium head blight. In the present study, the T. macha 4A resistance was further characterized in a 'Hobbit Sib' (T. macha 4A) single-recombinant chromosome doubled haploid (DH) population. Lines were phenotyped for disease resistance, yield components and deoxynivalenol (DON) mycotoxin content over two consecutive seasons. Both resistance to spread and resistance to initial infection were examined, and it was established that the resistance residing on T. macha 4A is predominantly of type I (resistance to initial infection). It was demonstrated that this type I resistance significantly lowered levels of DON accumulation in the grain and improved yield components under high disease pressure. Genotyping the DH lines using microsatellite genetic markers enabled the location of the gene(s) for resistance to be assigned to a region of the short arm of chromosome 4A, distal to microsatellite marker Xgwm601 and co-segregating with microsatellite marker Xgwm165 in this population."

"18470205","abstracttext","Triticum longissimum cytoplasm is incompatible with the T. turgidum nuclear genome. Two nuclear genes, scs and Vi, derived from the nuclear genome of T. timopheevii and by a spontaneous mutation, respectively, restore nuclear-cytoplasmic compatibility, normal plant vigor, and male fertility in these alloplasmic genotypes. The objectives of this study were (i) to determine the chromosomal locations of scs and Vi; (ii) to identify DNA markers for scs and Vi; and (iii) to determine the interactions involving the dosage of scs and Vi. Two populations segregating for scs and Vi were produced and scored for seedling vigor (indicating presence of scs) and degree of self-fertility (indicating presence of Vi). Four RFLP markers were mapped near scs. Aneuploid analysis revealed that these markers, and hence the scs gene, are located on the long arm of chromosome 1A. Four RFLP markers were mapped near Vi on 1BS. Results indicated that other factors may be inhibiting the expression of Vi. We determined the dosage of scs and Vi in both populations with the aid of the linked RFLP markers. Individuals with two versus one dose of scs had reduced self-fertility, while individuals with two versus one dose of Vi had similar self-fertility."

"19583772","abstracttext","Two forms of a novel antimicrobial peptide (AMP), named WAMP-1a and WAMP-1b, that differ by a single C-terminal amino acid residue and belong to a new structural type of plant AMP were purified from seeds of Triticum kiharae Dorof. et Migusch. Although WAMP-1a and WAMP-1b share similarity with hevein-type peptides, they possess 10 cysteine residues arranged in a unique cysteine motif which is distinct from those described previously for plant AMPs, but is characteristic of the chitin-binding domains of cereal class I chitinases. An unusual substitution of a serine for a glycine residue in the chitin-binding domain was detected for the first time in hevein-like polypeptides. Recombinant WAMP-1a was successfully produced in Escherichia coli. This is the first case of high-yield production of a cysteine-rich plant AMP from a synthetic gene. Assays of recombinant WAMP-1a activity showed that the peptide possessed high broad-spectrum inhibitory activity against diverse chitin-containing and chitin-free pathogens, with IC(50) values in the micromolar range. The discovery of a new type of AMP active against structurally dissimilar microorganisms implies divergent modes of action and discloses the complexity of plant-microbe interactions."

"24558978","abstracttext_background","The use of auxin-producing rhizosphere bacteria as agricultural products promises increased root production and therefore greater phosphate (Pi) uptake. Whilst such bacteria promote root production in vitro, the nature of the bacteria-plant interaction in live soil, particularly concerning any effects on nutrient uptake, are not known. This study uses Bacillus amyloliquefaciens FZB42, an auxin-producing rhizobacterium, as a dressing on Triticum aestivium seeds. It then examines the effects on root production, Pi uptake, Pi-related gene expression and organic carbon (C) exudation."
"24558978","abstracttext_results","Seed treatment with B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 increased root production at low environmental Pi concentrations, but significantly repressed root Pi uptake. This coincided with an auxin-mediated reduction in expression of the Pi transporters TaPHT1.8 and TaPHT1.10. Applied exogenous auxin also triggered an increase in root C exudation. At high external Pi concentrations, root production was promoted by B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42, but Pi uptake was unaffected."
"24558978","abstracttext_conclusions","We conclude that, alongside promoting root production, auxin biosynthesis by B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42 both re-models Pi transporter expression and elevates organic C exudation. This shows the potential importance of rhizobacterial-derived auxin following colonisation of root surfaces, and the nature of this bacteria-plant interaction in soil."

"32375329","abstracttext","S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) is a key enzyme involved in many important biological processes, such as ethylene and polyamine biosynthesis, transmethylation, and transsulfuration. Here, the SAM synthetase (SAMS) gene family was studied in ten different plants (Arabidopsis, tomato, eggplant, sunflower, Medicago truncatula , soybean, rice, barley, Triticum urartu and sorghum) with respect to its physical structure, physicochemical characteristics, and post-transcriptional and post-translational modifications. Additionally, the expression patterns of SAMS genes in tomato were analyzed based on a real-time quantitative PCR assay and an analysis of a public expression dataset. SAMS genes of monocots were more conserved according to the results of a phylogenetic analysis and the prediction of phosphorylation and glycosylation patterns. SAMS genes showed differential expression in response to abiotic stresses and exogenous hormone treatments. Solyc01g101060 was especially expressed in fruit and root tissues, while Solyc09g008280 was expressed in leaves. Additionally, our results revealed that exogenous BR and ABA treatments strongly reduced the expression of tomato SAMS genes. Our research provides new insights and clues about the role of SAMS genes. In particular, these results can inform future functional analyses aimed at revealing the molecular mechanisms underlying the functions of SAMS genes in plants."

"30128756","abstracttext","The rhizosphere microbiome plays a significant role in the life of plants in promoting plant survival under adverse conditions. However, limited information is available about microbial diversity in saline environments. In the current study, we compared the composition of the rhizosphere microbiomes of the halophytes Urochloa, Kochia, Salsola, and Atriplex living in moderate and high salinity environments (Khewra salt mines; Pakistan) with that of the non-halophyte Triticum. Soil microbiomes analysis using pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene indicated that Actinobacteria were dominant in saline soil samples whereas Proteobacteria predominated in non-saline soil samples. Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Bacteriodetes and Thaumarchaeota were predominant phyla in saline and non-saline soils, whereas Cyanobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Gemmatimonadetes and the unclassified WPS-2 were less abundant. Sequences from Euryarchaeota, Ignavibacteriae, and Nanohaloarchaeota were identified only from the rhizosphere of halophytes. Dominant halophilic bacteria and archaea identified in this study included Agrococcus, Armatimonadetes gp4, Halalkalicoccus, Haloferula and Halobacterium. Our analysis showed that increases in soil salinity correlated with significant differences in the alpha and beta diversity of the microbial communities across saline and non-saline soil samples. Having a complete inventory of the soil bacteria from different saline environments in Pakistan will help in the discovery of potential inoculants for crops growing on salt-affected land."

"32147927","abstracttext_methods and results","The pqqE gene was PCR amplified and sequenced in genomic DNA of Pantoea sp. WP-5 and Pseudomonas sp. NN-4. Nucleotide sequence obtained from WP-5 and NN-4 showed maximum sequence similarity (88 and 89%, respectively) with the pqqE gene of Pseudomonas fluorescens strain CMR12a (KM251420). Deduced amino acid sequence from pqqE gene of Pseudomonas sp. NN-4 and Pantoea sp. WP-5 showed 75 and 93% similarity, respectively, with protein pyrroloquinoline quinone. Phosphate solubilization and acid production assay were quantified on spectrophotometer and high-profile liquid chromatograph, respectively, by each bacterial strain. Both strains produced organic acids such as acetic, citric, gluconic, succinic and malic acid and lowered the pH of Pikovskaya broth medium under laboratory conditions. Phosphate solubilization by Pantoea sp. WP-5 was 311 ± 4 and 204 ± 3 µg ml -1 in the culture medium supplemented with glucose and sucrose as carbon source, respectively. Pseudomonas sp. NN-4 solubilized 176 ± 3 and 298 ± 5 µg ml -1 phosphate in Pikovskaya broth medium under similar conditions. In field experiments conducted during two consecutive years, the concentration of acetic acid and gluconic acid was higher in root exudates of plants treated with Pantoea sp. WP-5 at 30% reduced doses of nitrogen (N)- and phosphorus (P)-based chemical fertilizers as compared to non-inoculated plants. Values of chlorophyll contents, crop growth rate, leaf area index, straw yield and P contents were recorded higher in plants inoculated with Pantoea sp. WP-5 and Pseudomonas sp. NN-4 as compared to non-inoculated control. Grain yield was increased by 10-12% due to inoculation with Pantoea sp. WP-5 and Pseudomonas sp.

"19825183","abstracttext_background","In some genomic applications it is necessary to design large numbers of PCR primers in exons flanking one or several introns on the basis of orthologous gene sequences in related species. The primer pairs designed by this target gene approach are called ""intron-flanking primers"" or because they are located in exonic sequences which are usually conserved between related species, ""conserved primers"". They are useful for large-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery and marker development, especially in species, such as wheat, for which a large number of ESTs are available but for which genome sequences and intron/exon boundaries are not available. To date, no suitable high-throughput tool is available for this purpose."
"19825183","abstracttext_results","We have developed, the ConservedPrimers 2.0 pipeline, for designing intron-flanking primers for large-scale SNP discovery and marker development, and demonstrated its utility in wheat. This tool uses non-redundant wheat EST sequences, such as wheat contigs and singleton ESTs, and related genomic sequences, such as those of rice, as inputs. It aligns the ESTs to the genomic sequences to identify unique colinear exon blocks and predicts intron lengths. Intron-flanking primers are then designed based on the intron/exon information using the Primer3 core program or BatchPrimer3. Finally, a tab-delimited file containing intron-flanking primer pair sequences and their primer properties is generated for primer ordering and their PCR applications. Using this tool, 1,922 bin-mapped wheat ESTs (31.8% of the 6,045 in total) were found to have unique colinear exon blocks suitable for primer design and 1,821 primer pairs were designed from these single- or low-copy genes for PCR amplification and SNP discovery.

"23127207","abstracttext_background","Development of a high quality reference sequence is a daunting task in crops like wheat with large (~17Gb), highly repetitive (>80%) and polyploid genome. To achieve complete sequence assembly of such genomes, development of a high quality physical map is a necessary first step. However, due to the lack of recombination in certain regions of the chromosomes, genetic mapping, which uses recombination frequency to map marker loci, alone is not sufficient to develop high quality marker scaffolds for a sequence ready physical map. Radiation hybrid (RH) mapping, which uses radiation induced chromosomal breaks, has proven to be a successful approach for developing marker scaffolds for sequence assembly in animal systems. Here, the development and characterization of a RH panel for the mapping of D-genome of wheat progenitor Aegilops tauschii is reported."
"23127207","abstracttext_results","Radiation dosages of 350 and 450 Gy were optimized for seed irradiation of a synthetic hexaploid (AABBDD) wheat with the D-genome of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78. The surviving plants after irradiation were crossed to durum wheat (AABB), to produce pentaploid RH1s (AABBD), which allows the simultaneous mapping of the whole D-genome. A panel of 1,510 RH1 plants was obtained, of which 592 plants were generated from the mature RH1 seeds, and 918 plants were rescued through embryo culture due to poor germination (<3%) of mature RH1 seeds. This panel showed a homogenous marker loss (2.1%) after screening with SSR markers uniformly covering all the D-genome chromosomes. Different marker systems mostly detected different lines with deletions. Using markers covering known distances, the mapping resolution of this RH panel was estimated to be <140kb. Analysis of only 16 RH lines carrying deletions on chromosome 2D resulted in a physical map with cM/cR ratio of 1:5.2 and 15 distinct bins. Additionally, with this small set of lines, almost all the tested ESTs could be mapped. A set of 399 most informative RH lines with an average deletion frequency of ~10% were identified for developing high density marker scaffolds of the D-genome."

The results provided insight into various aspects of RH mapping in plants, including the genetically effective cell number for wheat (for the first time) and the potential implementation of this technique in other plant species. This RH panel will be an invaluable resource for mapping gene based markers, developing a complete marker scaffold for the whole genome sequence assembly, fine mapping of markers and functional characterization of genes and gene networks present on the D-genome."

"24955113","abstracttext_results","In order to set up biodegradative microcosms, microbial communities were retrieved from a forest soil and introduced into a mineral salt medium containing 1% of (un)treated wheat straw. Following each incubation step, sequential transfers were carried out using 1 to 1,000 dilutions. The microbial source next to three sequential batch cultures (transfers 1, 3 and 10) were analyzed by bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal ITS1 pyrosequencing. Faith's phylogenetic diversity values became progressively smaller from the inoculum to the sequential batch cultures. Moreover, increases in the relative abundances of Enterobacteriales, Pseudomonadales, Flavobacteriales and Sphingobacteriales were noted along the enrichment process. Operational taxonomic units affiliated with Acinetobacter johnsonii, Pseudomonas putida and Sphingobacterium faecium were abundant and the underlying strains were successfully isolated. Interestingly, Klebsiella variicola (OTU1062) was found to dominate in both consortia, whereas K. variicola-affiliated strains retrieved from untreated wheat straw consortia showed endoglucanase/xylanase activities. Among the fungal players with high biotechnological relevance, we recovered members of the genera Penicillium, Acremonium, Coniochaeta and Trichosporon. Remarkably, the presence of peroxidases, alpha-L-fucosidases, beta-xylosidases, beta-mannases and beta-glucosidases, involved in lignocellulose degradation, was indicated by predictive bacterial metagenome reconstruction.

"2820978","articletitle","A gibberellin responsive wheat gene has homology to yeast carboxypeptidase Y."
"2820978","abstracttext","An earlier report (Baulcombe, D. C., and Buffard, D. (1983) Planta 157, 493-501) described the isolation of cDNA clones from mRNAs which are produced in increased amounts when aleurone layers of wheat are treated with gibberellic acid. It is shown here that for one of those cDNAs (2473) the change in level of mRNA in aleurone parallels the change in level of alpha-amylase mRNA. This result was obtained in experiments where the level of gibberellic acid was varied and also when the mRNA was isolated from wheat genotypes which varied in ability to respond to gibberellic acid. In contrast to this, the pattern of 2437 mRNA accumulation in immature grains and in leaf tissue was quite distinct from the pattern of alpha-amylase mRNA accumulation. Analysis of wheat DNA showed that the 2437 mRNA is encoded by a small family of genes located on the short arm of the group 6 chromosomes. One member of this gene family was cloned and sequenced. The coding sequence is interrupted by eight introns and encodes a protein of Mr 55,433. By using hybridization probes from the 5' exon in an S1 nuclease protection assay it was shown that the 2437 mRNA was produced in aleurones (coordinately with alpha-amylase) and in immature grains (not coordinately with alpha-amylase). However, sequence comparison of 1 kilobase of the 5'-flanking region with the sequence of alpha-amylase genes provided no indication of the regulatory elements which would be active in aleurone cells. The protein sequence deduced from the gene sequence has extensive homology with the yeast carboxypeptidase Y, especially in the active site and substrate binding regions. This homology is greater than with the carboxypeptidase I from barley. It is suggested therefore that there are several types of carboxypeptidase encoded in the cereal genome. The sequence of the 2437 protein would represent one of these types and the barley carboxypeptidase I, another."
"3418693","articletitle","Structure and evolution of the intergenic region in a ribosomal DNA repeat unit of wheat."
"3418693","abstracttext","The complete nucleotide sequence of the intergenic region between the 25 S and 18 S wheat ribosomal RNA genes has been determined from a 4.6 kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment (1 kb = 10(3) bases or base-pairs) subcloned from the plasmid pTa71. Within this subclone the intergenic DNA is flanked by the 3' end of the 25 S and the 5' end of the 18 S ribosomal RNA sequences. Four repeat families are present within the intergenic region. The major repeat family A, consists of 12 direct repeat units of 135 or 136 base-pairs (bp) flanked by diverged truncated copies. Within each A repeat a subrepeat structure has been revealed. Family B, which is localized to the 5' side of the A repeats, contains three repeat units, one of 152 bp, the second of 150 bp and a truncated unit of 107 bp. Family C, which is localized in the transcribed rRNA precursor, consists of two direct repeat units of 172 and 174 bp and possesses some short subrepeat motifs. The C repeats may have evolved by and diverged from one another by the insertion of short transposable sequences. Family D consists of two direct repeat units of 30 bp located 5' to the start of transcription. Statistical analysis of repeat family A showed that there is a significant association between the similarity of any two repeat units and their distance apart in the array. The near identity of members of the A family is maintained presumably by processes such as unequal crossing over and gene conversion, but the members at each end of the array show more divergence. Sequence motifs in the A and C repeat families and in other regions including the 5' end of 18 S RNA are related, implying that much of the intergenic DNA may have evolved from a few short ancestral sequences. The B and D repeats or their equivalent are not found in a maize ribosomal DNA repeat unit. The DNA in the external transcribed spacer DNA 5' to the 18 S RNA sequence is longer in wheat than in maize. This is due principally to two duplications and insertion of a sequence with dyad symmetry in the wheat gene."
"6473104","articletitle","Recombination sequences in plant mitochondrial genomes: diversity and homologies to known mitochondrial genes."
"6473104","abstracttext","Several plant mitochondrial genomes contain repeated sequences that are postulated to be sites of homologous intragenomic recombination (1-3). In this report, we have used filter hybridizations to investigate sequence relationships between the cloned mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) recombination repeats from turnip, spinach and maize and total mtDNA isolated from thirteen species of angiosperms. We find that strong sequence homologies exist between the spinach and turnip recombination repeats and essentially all other mitochondrial genomes tested, whereas a major maize recombination repeat does not hybridize to any other mtDNA. The sequences homologous to the turnip repeat do not appear to function in recombination in any other genome, whereas the spinach repeat hybridizes to reiterated sequences within the mitochondrial genomes of wheat and two species of pokeweed that do appear to be sites of recombination. Thus, although intragenomic recombination is a widespread phenomenon in plant mitochondria, it appears that different sequences either serve as substrates for this function in different species, or else surround a relatively short common recombination site which does not cross-hybridize under our experimental conditions. Identified gene sequences from maize mtDNA were used in heterologous hybridizations to show that the repeated sequences implicated in recombination in turnip and spinach/pokeweed/wheat mitochondria include, or are closely linked to genes for subunit II of cytochrome c oxidase and 26S rRNA, respectively. Together with previous studies indicating that the 18S rRNA gene in wheat mtDNA is contained within a recombination repeat (3), these results imply an unexpectedly frequent association between recombination repeats and plant mitochondrial genes."

"8507826","abstracttext","Polyclonal antibodies were raised against a purified 22 kDa triticin polypeptide (delta) and were used to screen a wheat seed cDNA library in the Escherichia coli expression vector lambda gt11. The isolated cDNA clones were grouped into three families based on their cross-hybridization reactions in DNA dot-blot studies. Southern blots of genomic DNAs extracted from ditelocentric and nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of Chinese Spring wheat, probes with the excised cDNA inserts, indicated that one of the three families (9 clones) had triticin clones. This was finally confirmed by comparing the predicted amino acid sequences of two of these clones (lambda Tri-12, lambda Tri-25) with the published tryptic peptide sequences of triticin. The Southern blots also showed that there is at least one triticin gene located on the short arm of each of the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes (1A, 1B, 1D), although till now no triticin protein product has been identified for the chromosome 1B. The nucleotide sequence of the largest triticin cDNA clone lambda Tri-25 (1567 bp) is presented here, and its predicted amino acid sequence shows strong homology with the legumin-like proteins of oats (12S globulin), rice (glutelin) and legume seeds. A unique feature of the triticin sequence is that it contains a lysine-rich repetitive domain, inserted in the hypervariable region of the typical legumin-like genes. Northern blotting of total RNA extracted from different stages of the developing wheat seed revealed that the triticin gene expression is switched on 5-10 days after anthesis (DAA). There was a steady increase in the level of triticin mRNA until 20 DAA, after which it started decreasing. The maximum mRNA accumulation occurred between 17 and 20 DAA. These observations conform closely with the published data on triticin protein accumulation during grain development."

"9291969","abstracttext","Plants accumulate abscisic acid (ABA) under droughted conditions. Genetic variation in the accumulation of ABA in deteched and partially dehydrated leaves of rice has previously been reported, and this was found to be associated with variation in leaf size (smaller leaves made more ABA). Correlation analysis failed to distinguish clearly between a causal relationship between the two traits and close genetic between loci controlling the traits. Here we present a detailed genetic analysis of ABA accumulation in detached and partially dehydrated rice leaves. using a population of F2 plants generated from the lowland x upland cross IR20 (high-ABA) x 63-83 (low-ABA) which was mapped with RFLP and AFLP markers. Several highly significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for ABA accumulation and leaf weight were identified. Only one of the minor QTLs for ABA accumulation (accounting for only 4% of the phenotypic variance) was coincident with any QTLs for leaf size such that the high-ABA allele was associated with smaller leaves. This analysis, therefore, showed that the association previously found between ABA accumulation and leaf size was probably largely due to genetic linkage and not to a direct effect of leaf size on ABA accumulation or vice versa. Because of the importance of ABA accumulation in regulating responses of plants to drought stress and the effects of plant size on the rate of development of stress, QTLs for drought-induced ABA accumulation, leaf size and tiller number were compared between rice and wheat. In particular, a possible location in rice was sought for a homoeologue of the major wheat vernalization responsive gene, Vrn1, as this gene is also associated with major effects on leaf size, tiller number and ABA accumulation in wheat. The likelihood of homoeologous loci regulating ABA accumulation, leaf size and tiller number in the two crops is discussed."

"10659793","abstracttext","The grain softness proteins or friabilins are known to be composed of three main components: puroindoline a, puroindoline b, and GSP-1. cDNAs for GSP-1 have previously been mapped to group-5 chromosomes and their location on chromosome 5D is closely linked to the grain hardness (Ha) locus of hexaploid wheat. A genomic DNA clone containing the GSP-1 gene (wGSP1-A1) from hexaploid wheat has been identified by fluorescent in situ hybridization as having originated from the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 5A. A genomic clone containing the gene (wGSP1-D1) was also isolated from Aegilops tauschii, the donor of the D genome to bread wheat. There are no introns in the GSP-1 genes, and there is high sequence identity between wGSP1-A1 and wGSP1-D1 up to 1 kb 5' and 300 bp 3' to wGSP1-D1. However, regions further upstream and downstream of wGSP1-D1 share no significant sequence identity to corresponding sequences in wGSP1-A1. These regions therefore identified potentially valuable sequences for tracing the Ha locus through assaying polymorphic DNA sequences. The sequence from 300 to 500 bp 3' to wGSP1-D1 (wGSP1-D13) was mapped to the Ha locus in a mapping population. wGSP1-D13 was also tightly linked to genes for puroindoline a and puroindoline b which have been previously mapped to be at the Ha locus. In addition wGSP1-D13 was used to detect RFLPs between near isogenic soft and hard Falcon lines and in a random selection of soft and hard wheats."

"15388227","abstracttext","Malate dehydrogenase (MDH), which is ubiquitous in nature, catalyzes the interconversion of oxaloacetate and malate. Higher plants contain multiple forms of MDH that differ in co-enzyme specificity, subcellular localization and physiological function. Cytosolic NAD-dependent MDH (cyMDH) is one class of MDH that has not been extensively characterized in plants. Here we report the cloning of a cDNA from wheat by RT-PCR and cDNA library screening, which is designated as TaMDH. Sequence analysis indicated that TaMDH exhibits a highly similarity to other plant cyMDHs. Immunological analysis confirmed that TaMDH encoded a cytosolic NAD-dependent MDH. The secondary and three-dimensional structures of TaMDH were analyzed by molecular modeling. DNA gel-blot analyses demonstrated that TaMDH gene exists as two copies in the wheat genome. RNA and protein gel-blot hybridization indicated that both TaMDH mRNA and protein were constitutively expressed in vegetative tissues of wheat, with slightly lower levels in roots than in leaves and stems. In silico analysis indicated that TaMDH was also expressed in various reproductive tissues and tissues under many different stress conditions. Kinetic analysis of bacterially expressed and purified protein confirmed that TaMDH catalyzed a reaction driven towards malate synthesis, which is consistent with other cyMDHs. Evolutionary analysis showed that this class of genes evolved from a very ancestral gene. The cyMDH represents an ancestral form of MDH, which is highly conserved in plants, animals and bacteria. This implies that cyMDHs are housekeeping genes and may have very essential functions in plant metabolism."

"12684822","abstracttext","Gametocidal (Gc) genes, introduced into common wheat from related Aegilops species, are selfish genetic elements that ensure their preferential transmission by inducing chromosomal breaks. Here we report the production and characterization of a knock-out mutation of the Gc2 gene transferred to wheat as a wheat-Aegilops sharonensis T4B-4S(sh)#1 translocation chromosome. In hemizygous Gc2/- condition, gametophytes lacking Gc2 suffer chromosomal fragmentation and produce non-functional gametes, which leads to sporophytic semisterility and exclusive transmission of the Gc2-carrier chromosome. We have identified one putative ethyl methylsulfonate (EMS)-induced Gc2 mutant that restores spike fertility and shows Mendelian segregation. Progeny screening mapped the mutation to the Gc2-carrier chromosome T4B-4S(sh)#1. C-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses showed that the loss of Gc2 function in the mutant is not due to a terminal deficiency. Analysis of first and second pollen mitoses in Gc2(mut) /- plants and C-banding analysis of testcross progenies showed that no chromosomal breakage occurs in the mutant. No gametophytic chromosomal breakage was observed in heterozygous Gc2(mut) /Gc2 plants, which had fully fertile spikes. These results suggest that Gc2 encodes two agents, one causing chromosomal breaks in gametophytes lacking Gc2 and another that protects the Gc2 carrier from breakage. The EMS-induced Gc2 mutant appears to be a knock-out of the gene encoding the ""breaking"" agent. These data are a first crucial step toward the molecular understanding of Gc2 action."

"18397318","abstracttext","The uptake of five fluorescein labeled cell-penetrating peptides (Tat, Tat(2), mutated-Tat, peptide vascular endothelial-cadherin and transportan) was studied in wheat immature embryos. Interestingly, permeabilization treatment of the embryos with toluene/ethanol (1 : 20, v/v with permeabilization buffer) resulted in a remarkably higher uptake of cell-penetrating peptides, whereas nonpermeabilized embryos failed to show significant cell-penetrating peptide uptake, as observed under fluorescence microscope and by fluorimetric analysis. Among the cell-penetrating peptides investigated, Tat monomer (Tat) showed highest fluorescence uptake (4.2-fold greater) in permeabilized embryos than the nonpermeabilized embryos. On the other hand, mutated-Tat serving as negative control did not show comparable fluorescence levels even in permeabilized embryos. A glucuronidase histochemical assay revealed that Tat peptides can efficiently deliver functionally active beta-glucuronidase (GUS) enzyme in permeabilized immature embryos. Tat(2)-mediated GUS enzyme delivery showed the highest number of embryos with GUS uptake (92.2%) upon permeabilization treatment with toluene/ethanol (1 : 40, v/v with permeabilization buffer) whereas only 51.8% of nonpermeabilized embryos showed Tat(2)-mediated GUS uptake. Low temperature, endocytosis and macropinocytosis inhibitors reduced delivery of the Tat(2)-GUS enzyme cargo complex. The results suggest that more than one mechanism of cell entry is involved simultaneously in cell-penetrating peptide-cargo uptake in wheat immature embryos. We also studied Tat(2)-plasmid DNA (carrying Act-1GUS) complex formation by gel retardation assay, DNaseI protection assay and confocal laser microscopy. Permeabilized embryos transfected with Tat(2)-plasmid DNA complex showed 3.3-fold higher transient GUS gene expression than the nonpermeabilized embryos. Furthermore, addition of cationic transfecting agent Lipofectamine 2000 to the Tat(2)-plasmid DNA complex resulted in 1.5-fold higher transient GUS gene expression in the embryos. This is the first report demonstrating translocation of various cell-penetrating peptides and their potential to deliver macromolecules in wheat immature embryos in the presence of a cell membrane permeabilizing agent."

"15221230","abstracttext","Aspergillus oryzae is a fungus used extensively in the fermentation industry. We constructed cDNA microarrays comprising 2,070 highly expressed cDNAs selected from the approximately 6,000 non-redundant expressed sequence tags (ESTs) in the A. oryzae EST database (http://www.aist.go.jp/RIODB/ffdb/index.html). Using the cDNA microarrays, we analyzed the gene expression profiles of A. oryzae cells grown under the glucose-rich (AC) and glucose-depleted (AN) liquid culture conditions used during the construction of the EST database. The sets of genes identified by the cDNA microarray as highly expressed under each culture condition agreed well with the highly redundant ESTs obtained under the same conditions. In particular, transcription levels of most catabolic genes of the glycolytic pathway (EMP) and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were higher under AC than AN conditions, suggesting that A. oryzae uses both EMP and TCA for glucose metabolism under AC conditions. We further studied the expression of genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes and enzymes involved in energy catabolism by using three industrial solid-phase biomass media, including wheat-bran. The wheat-bran culture gave the richest gene expression profile of hydrolytic enzymes and the lowest expression levels of catabolic genes (EMP, TCA) among the three media tested. The low expression levels of catabolic genes in the wheat-bran culture may release catabolite repression, consequently leading to the rich expression profiles of the hydrolytic enzymes."

"16283230","abstracttext","The stem, leaf and stripe rust resistance genes Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9, located on the short arm of rye chromosome 1, have been widely used in wheat by means of wheat-rye translocation chromosomes. Previous studies have suggested that these resistance specificities are encoded by either closely-linked genes, or by a single gene capable of recognizing all three rust species. To investigate these issues, two 1BL.1RS wheat lines, one with and one without Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9, were used as parents for a high-resolution F2 mapping family. Thirty-six recombinants were identified between two PCR markers 2.3 cM apart that flanked the resistance locus. In one recombinant, Lr26 was separated from Sr31 and Yr9. Mutation studies recovered mutants that separated all three rust resistance genes. Thus, together, the recombination and mutation studies suggest that Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9 are separate closely-linked genes. An additional 16 DNA markers were mapped in this region. Multiple RFLP markers, identified using part of the barley Mla powdery mildew resistance gene as probe, co-segregated with Sr31 and Yr9. One deletion mutant that had lost Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9 retained all Mla markers, suggesting that the family of genes on 1RS identified by the Mla probe does not contain the Sr31, Lr26 or Yr9 genes. The genetic stocks and DNA markers generated from this study should facilitate the future cloning of Sr31, Lr26 and Yr9."
"16331478","articletitle","Leaf tip necrosis, molecular markers and beta1-proteasome subunits associated with the slow rusting resistance genes Lr46/Yr29."
"16331478","abstracttext","Resistance based on slow-rusting genes has proven to be a useful strategy to develop wheat cultivars with durable resistance to rust diseases in wheat. However this type of resistance is often difficult to incorporate into a single genetic background due to the polygenic and additive nature of the genes involved. Therefore, markers, both molecular and phenotypic, are useful tools to facilitate the use of this type of resistance in wheat breeding programs. We have used field assays to score for both leaf and yellow rust in an Avocet-YrA x Attila population that segregates for several slow-rusting leaf and yellow rust resistance genes. This population was analyzed with the AFLP technique and the slow-rusting resistance locus Lr46/Yr29 was identified. A common set of AFLP and SSR markers linked to the Lr46/Yr29 locus was identified and validated in other recombinant inbred families developed from single chromosome recombinant populations that segregated for Lr46. These populations segregated for leaf tip necrosis (LTN) in the field, a trait that had previously been associated with Lr34/Yr18. We show that LTN is also pleiotropic or closely linked to the Lr46/Yr29 locus and suggest that a new Ltn gene designation should be given to this locus, in addition to the one that already exists for Lr34/Yr18. Coincidentally, members of a small gene family encoding beta-1 proteasome subunits located on group 1L and 7S chromosomes implicated in plant defense were linked to the Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29 loci."
"17716766","articletitle","Marker-assisted selection for Fusarium head blight resistance in wheat."
"17716766","abstracttext","The cultivation of wheat varieties resistant to Fusarium head blight (FHB) is recognized as one of the most important components to diminish losses due to this disease. Although there is no known immunity to this disease in wheat germplasm, considerable improvements in genetic resistance have been achieved by concentrated breeding efforts that have relied primarily upon repeated field and greenhouse-based screening. DNA markers are a relatively new technology that can be used to increase breeding progress, especially for traits such as FHB that are difficult to select for under field conditions and that are controlled by multiple genes. Marker-assisted selection (MAS) uses markers to select for particular DNA segments that are genetically linked to genes that provide incremental resistance to FHB. One particular gene, designated Fhb1, provides a 20-25% average reduction in FHB symptoms. This gene and its associated markers have been validated in numerous breeding programs and is widely used to more precisely breed for resistance. About a dozen other genes affecting FHB reaction have been identified, but they have smaller and more inconsistent effects compared with Fhb1. Nevertheless, breeders are discovering which of these markers can be combined with Fhb1 in their genetic backgrounds to enhance resistance. The establishment of the USDA-ARS Regional Small Grains Genotyping Centers and similar facilities around the world have increased the capacity for wheat breeders to utilize this powerful technology. More efficient DNA extraction technologies and marker platforms will allow breeders to more fully implement MAS in the future."
"18194164","articletitle","Insight into the genetic bases of climatic adaptation in experimentally evolving wheat populations."
"18194164","abstracttext","Experimental populations evolving under natural selection represent an interesting tool to study genetic bases of adaptation. Evolution of genes possibly involved in adaptive response can be followed together with the corresponding phenotypic traits. Using experimental populations of hexaploid wheat, we studied the evolution of flowering time, a major adaptive trait that synchronizes the initiation of reproduction and the occurrence of favourable environmental conditions. During 12 generations, three populations were grown in contrasted environments (Vervins North France, Le Moulon near Paris, Toulouse South France) under the influence of natural selection, drift, mutation and recombination. Evolution of diversity at the major gene VRN-1 involved in wheat vernalization response has been analysed jointly with earliness estimated in controlled conditions. Whatever the population, rapid phenotypic changes as well as parallel genotypic variations were observed in the first seven generations, probably as the result of selection acting on this major gene which explains 80% of the trait variation overall. Different allelic combinations at physically unlinked copies of VRN-1 located on distinct genomes (A, B and D) were selected between populations. As theoretically expected, due to population differentiation, a high level of genetic diversity was maintained overall in generation 12. Surprisingly, in two populations out of three, the emergence of new alleles by mutation or migration, coupled with temporal variable selection or frequency-dependent selection, allowed to maintain within-population diversity despite local genetic drift and natural selection. This result may plead for an evolutionary approach of wheat genetic resource conservation."

"17630295","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat reduces the quality and economic value of grain, and increasing PHS tolerance is one of the most important traits in wheat breeding. Two new Vp-1B alleles related to PHS tolerance were identified on the 3BL chromosome of bread wheat and were designated Vp-1Bb and Vp-1Bc. Sequence analysis showed that Vp-1Bb has a 193 bp insertion and Vp-1Bc has a 83 bp deletion located in the third intron region of the Vp-1B gene, and that they shared 95.43% and 97.89% similarity, respectively, with the sequence of AJ400713 (Vp-1Ba) at the nucleotide level. Their sequences were deposited in the GenBank under the accession numbers DQ517493 and DQ517494. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that alternatively spliced transcripts of the Vp-1A, Vp-1B, and Vp-1D homologues were present and there were no differences in the splicing patterns or abundances of Vp-1A and Vp-1D from embryos 35 d after pollination between PHS-tolerant and -susceptible cultivars. Although Vp-1Ba, Vp-1Bb, and Vp-1Bc could each produce a set of transcripts, only one was correctly spliced and had the capacity to encode the full-length VP1 protein and was more highly expressed with Vp-1Bb and Vp-1Bc than with Vp-1Ba. Comparison of the expression patterns of Vp-1Ba, Vp-1Bb, and Vp-1Bc on different days after pollination also revealed that the expression of these genes was developmentally regulated. Furthermore, genotypes with different levels of tolerance to PHS respond differently to ABA exposure and differences in transcript levels of Vp-1Ba, Vp-1Bb, and Vp-1Bc were observed after ABA treatment. The results indicated that insertion or deletion in the third intron region might affect the expression of the Vp-1B gene and its sensitivity to ABA, and thus resistance to PHS."

"21980420","abstracttext","Type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) play important roles in regulating many biological processes in eukaryotes. Currently, little is known about functions of PP2Cs in filamentous fungi. The causal agent of wheat head blight, Fusarium graminearum, contains seven putative PP2C genes, FgPTC1, -3, -5, -5R, -6, -7 and -7R. In order to investigate roles of these PP2Cs, we constructed deletion mutants for all seven PP2C genes in this study. The FgPTC3 deletion mutant (ΔFgPtc3-8) exhibited reduced aerial hyphae formation and deoxynivalenol (DON) production, but increased production of conidia. The mutant showed increased resistance to osmotic stress and cell wall-damaging agents on potato dextrose agar plates. Pathogencity assays showed that ΔFgPtc3-8 is unable to infect flowering wheat head. All of the defects were restored when ΔFgPtc3-8 was complemented with the wild-type FgPTC3 gene. Additionally, the FgPTC3 partially rescued growth defect of a yeast PTC1 deletion mutant under various stress conditions. Ultrastructural and histochemical analyses showed that conidia of ΔFgPtc3-8 contained an unusually high number of large lipid droplets. Furthermore, the mutant accumulated a higher basal level of glycerol than the wild-type progenitor. Quantitative real-time PCR assays showed that basal expression of FgOS2, FgSLT2 and FgMKK1 in the mutant was significantly higher than that in the wild-type strain. Serial analysis of gene expression in ΔFgPtc3-8 revealed that FgPTC3 is associated with various metabolic pathways. In contrast to the FgPTC3 mutant, the deletion mutants of FgPTC1, FgPTC5, FgPTC5R, FgPTC6, FgPTC7 or FgPTC7R did not show aberrant phenotypic features when grown on PDA medium or inoculated on wheat head. These results indicate FgPtc3 is the key PP2C that plays a critical role in a variety of cellular and biological functions, including cell wall integrity, lipid and secondary metabolisms, and virulence in F. graminearum."

Growth has been measured by determination of colony forming units (cfu). The expression of the ochratoxin A polyketide synthase (otapksPV) has been followed over time by reverse transcriptase Real Time PCR, whereas the biosynthesis of ochratoxin A by the fungus has been followed by HPLC. The remoisted and inoculated wheat was kept in perforated plastic bags and stored in tower silos. The bags were adjusted to 24%, 19% and 14% (m/m) relative moisture and stored for 6 month (September 06 - February 06) at ambient temperatures. A high increase of the cfu number up to a level of about lx10(8) cfu/g could be observed in the 24% sample. Interestingly no growth could be detected in the 14% and 19% samples. This result was supported by the quantitative Real Time PCR data. In congruence with this growth behaviour ochratoxin A could be detected from the first to the last time point in the 24% sample. Interestingly the ochratoxin A amounts measured over time did not show increasing or constant values, but varied from higher to lower values. After storage of three month (November 2006) the ochratoxin A concentration in the wheat was highest. The expression of theotapksPV gene mirrors this behaviour. The expression of this gene also fluctuates around a certain value, showing high activity after three month of storage."
"22568813","articletitle","Marker-assisted selection for disease resistance in wheat and barley breeding."
"22568813","abstracttext","Marker-assisted selection (MAS) provides opportunities for enhancing the response from selection because molecular markers can be applied at the seedling stage, with high precision and reductions in cost. About each of 50 genes conferring monogenic resistances and hundreds of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for quantitative disease resistances have been reported in wheat and barley. For detecting single-major gene resistance, MAS could be easily applied, but is often not necessary because the resistances are selected phenotypically. In quantitative disease resistances, MAS would be very useful, but the individual QTL often have small effects. Additionally, only a few monogenic resistances are durable and only a few QTL with high effects have been successfully transferred into elite breeding material. Further economic and biological constraints, e.g., a low return of investment in small-grain cereal breeding, lack of diagnostic markers, and the prevalence of QTL-background effects, hinder the broad implementation of MAS. Examples in which MAS has been successfully applied to practical breeding are the wheat rust resistance genes Lr34 and Yr36, the eyespot resistance gene Pch1, the recessive resistance genes rym4/rym5 to barley yellow mosaic viruses, mlo to barley powdery mildew, and two QTL for resistance to Fusarium head blight in wheat (Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A). Newly identified broad-spectrum resistance genes/QTL conferring resistance to multiple taxa of pathogens offer additional perspectives for MAS. In the future, chip-based, high-throughput genotyping platforms and the introduction of genomic selection will reduce the current problems of integrating MAS in practical breeding programs and open new avenues for a molecular-based resistance breeding."

"21359957","abstracttext","The grain color of wheat affects not only the brightness of flour, but also tolerance to preharvest sprouting. Grain color is controlled by dominant R-1 genes located on the long arm of hexaploid wheat chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D (R-A1, R-B1, and R-D1, respectively). The red pigment of the grain coat is composed of catechin and proanthocyanidin (PA), which are synthesized via the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway. We isolated the Tamyb10-A1, Tamyb10-B1, and Tamyb10-D1 genes, located on chromosomes 3A, 3B, and 3D, respectively. These genes encode R2R3-type MYB domain proteins, similar to TT2 of Arabidopsis, which controls PA synthesis in testa. In recessive R-A1 lines, two types of Tamyb10-A1 genes: (1) deletion of the first half of the R2-repeat of the MYB region and (2) insertion of a 2.2-kb transposon belonging to the hAT family. The Tamyb10-B1 genes of recessive R-B1 lines had 19-bp deletion, which caused a frame shift in the middle part of the open reading frame. With a transient assay using wheat coleoptiles, we revealed that the Tamyb10 gene in the dominant R-1 allele activated the flavonoid biosynthetic genes. We developed PCR-based markers to detect the dominant/recessive alleles of R-A1, R-B1, and R-D1. These markers proved to be correlated to known R-1 genotypes of 33 varieties except for a mutant with a single nucleotide substitution. Furthermore, double-haploid (DH) lines derived from the cross between red- and white-grained lines were found to necessarily carry functional Tamyb10 gene(s). Thus, PCR-based markers for Tamyb10 genes are very useful to detect R-1 alleles."

"21516354","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the preferred means of control of the disease. The winter wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 54 has high-temperature resistance to stripe rust. To identify genes for stripe rust resistance, Xiaoyan 54 was crossed with Mingxian 169, a winter wheat genotype susceptible to all Chinese races of the pathogen. Seedlings and adult plants of the parents and F(1), F(2), F(3) and F(4) progeny were tested with Chinese race CYR32 under controlled greenhouse conditions and in the field. Xiaoyan 54 has two recessive resistance genes, designated as Yrxy1 and Yrxy2, conferring high-temperature resistance. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were used to identify molecular markers flanking Yrxy2 using 181 plants from one segregating F(3) line. A total of nine markers, two of which flanked the locus at genetic distances of 4.0 and 6.4 cM on the long arm of chromosome 2A were identified. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and SSR techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to Yrxy1. A linkage group of nine RGAP and two SSR markers was constructed for Yrxy1 using 177 plants of another segregating F(3) line. Two RGAP markers were closely linked to the locus with genetic distances of 2.3 and 3.5 cM. Amplification of a set of nulli-tetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with RGAP markers M8 and M9 and the two SSR markers located Yrxy1 on the short arm of chromosome 7A. The SSR markers Xbarc49 and Xwmc422 were 15.8 and 26.1 cM, respectively, from the gene. The closely linked molecular markers should be useful for incorporating the resistance genes into commercial cultivars and combining them with other genes for stripe rust resistance."
"21691789","articletitle","Biological detoxification of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol and its use in genetically engineered crops and feed additives."
"21691789","abstracttext","Deoxynivalenol (DON) is the major mycotoxin produced by Fusarium fungi in grains. Food and feed contaminated with DON pose a health risk to humans and livestock. The risk can be reduced by enzymatic detoxification. Complete mineralization of DON by microbial cultures has rarely been observed and the activities turned out to be unstable. The detoxification of DON by reactions targeting its epoxide group or hydroxyl on carbon 3 is more feasible. Microbial strains that de-epoxidize DON under anaerobic conditions have been isolated from animal digestive system. Feed additives claimed to de-epoxidize trichothecenes enzymatically are on the market but their efficacy has been disputed. A new detoxification pathway leading to 3-oxo-DON and 3-epi-DON was discovered in taxonomically unrelated soil bacteria from three continents; the enzymes involved remain to be identified. Arabidopsis, tobacco, wheat, barley, and rice were engineered to acetylate DON on carbon 3. In wheat expressing DON acetylation activity, the increase in resistance against Fusarium head blight was only moderate. The Tri101 gene from Fusarium sporotrichioides was used; Fusarium graminearum enzyme which possesses higher activity towards DON would presumably be a better choice. Glycosylation of trichothecenes occurs in plants, contributing to the resistance of wheat to F. graminearum infection. Marker-assisted selection based on the trichothecene-3-O-glucosyltransferase gene can be used in breeding for resistance. Fungal acetyltransferases and plant glucosyltransferases targeting carbon 3 of trichothecenes remain promising candidates for engineering resistance against Fusarium head blight. Bacterial enzymes catalyzing oxidation, epimerization, and less likely de-epoxidation of DON may extend this list in future."

"22143458","abstracttext","Genetic maps of wheat chromosome 1D consisting of 57 microsatellite marker loci were constructed using Chinese Spring (CS) × Chiyacao F(2) and the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) mapping populations. Marker order was consistent, but genetic distances of neighboring markers were different in two populations. Physical bin map of 57 microsatellite marker loci was generated by means of 10 CS 1D deletion lines. The physical bin mapping indicated that microsatellite marker loci were not randomly distributed on chromosome 1D. Nineteen of the 24 (79.2%) microsatellite markers were mapped in the distal 30% genomic region of 1DS, whereas 25 of the 33 (75.8%) markers were assigned to the distal 59% region of 1DL. The powdery mildew resistance gene Pm24, originating from the Chinese wheat landrace Chiyacao, was previously mapped in the vicinity of the centromere on the short arm of chromosome 1D. A high density genetic map of chromosome 1D was constructed, consisting of 36 markers and Pm24, with a total map length of 292.7 cM. Twelve marker loci were found to be closely linked to Pm24. Pm24 was flanked by Xgwm789 (Xgwm603) and Xbarc229 with genetic distances of 2.4 and 3.6 cM, respectively, whereas a microsatellite marker Xgwm1291 co-segregated with Pm24. The microsatellite marker Xgwm1291 was assigned to the bin 1DS5-0.70-1.00 of the chromosome arm 1DS. It could be concluded that Pm24 is located in the '1S0.8 gene-rich region', a highly recombinogenic region of wheat. The results presented here would provide a start point for the map-based cloning of Pm24."
"23046423","articletitle","Genotype-specific SNP map based on whole chromosome 3B sequence information from wheat cultivars Arina and Forno."
"23046423","abstracttext","Agronomically important traits are frequently controlled by rare, genotype-specific alleles. Such genes can only be mapped in a population derived from the donor genotype. This requires the development of a specific genetic map, which is difficult in wheat because of the low level of polymorphism among elite cultivars. The absence of sufficient polymorphism, the complexity of the hexaploid wheat genome as well as the lack of complete sequence information make the construction of genetic maps with a high density of reproducible and polymorphic markers challenging. We developed a genotype-specific genetic map of chromosome 3B from winter wheat cultivars Arina and Forno. Chromosome 3B was isolated from the two cultivars and then sequenced to 10-fold coverage. This resulted in a single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) database of the complete chromosome. Based on proposed synteny with the Brachypodium model genome and gene annotation, sequences close to coding regions were used for the development of 70 SNP-based markers. They were mapped on a Arina × Forno Recombinant Inbred Lines population and found to be spread over the complete chromosome 3B. While overall synteny was well maintained, numerous exceptions and inversions of syntenic gene order were identified. Additionally, we found that the majority of recombination events occurred in distal parts of chromosome 3B, particularly in hot-spot regions. Compared with the earlier map based on SSR and RFLP markers, the number of markers increased fourfold. The approach presented here allows fast development of genotype-specific polymorphic markers that can be used for mapping and marker-assisted selection."

"24781075","abstracttext_key message","This manuscript reports a new gene (Yr62) and a small-effect QTL for potentially durable resistance to stripe rust and usefulness of Yr62 markers for marker-assisted selection. Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating disease of wheat worldwide. Spring wheat germplasm PI 192252 showed a high level of high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance to stripe rust in germplasm evaluation over 8 years in the State of Washington. To elucidate the genetic basis of resistance, PI 192252 was crossed with 'Avocet susceptible'. A mapping population of 150 F5 recombinant inbred lines was developed using single-seed descent. Stripe rust tests were conducted with selected Pst races in a greenhouse and in field conditions under natural infections. The relative area under the disease progress curve (rAUDPC) data showed continuous distributions, indicating that HTAP resistance of PI 192252 was controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTL). Two QTL were identified in PI 192252, explaining 74.2 % of the total phenotypic variation for rAUDPC. These two QTL were mapped to chromosomes 4BL (QYrPI192252.wgp-4BL) and 5BS (QYrPI192252.wgp-5BS) with SSR and SNP markers and explained 40-60 and 22-27 %, respectively, of the phenotypic variation across the four environments. Because the major-effect QTL on 4BL is different from previously named Yr genes and inherited as a single gene, it is named Yr62. The SSR marker alleles Xgwm192 222 and Xgwm251 133 flanking Yr62 were different from the alleles in various wheat varieties, suggesting that these markers could be useful in marker-assisted selection for incorporating Yr62 into commercial cultivars."

"23951332","abstracttext","Aegilops sharonensis Eig (Sharon goatgrass) is a wild diploid relative of wheat within the Sitopsis section of Aegilops. This species represents an untapped reservoir of genetic diversity for traits of agronomic importance, especially as a source of novel disease resistance. To gain a foothold in this genetic resource, we sequenced the cDNA from leaf tissue of two geographically distinct Ae. sharonensis accessions (1644 and 2232) using the 454 Life Sciences platform. We compared the results of two different assembly programs using different parameter sets to generate 13 distinct assemblies in an attempt to maximize representation of the gene space in de novo transcriptome assembly. The most sensitive assembly (71,029 contigs; N50 674 nts) retrieved 18,684 unique best reciprocal BLAST hits (BRBH) against six previously characterised grass proteomes while the most specific assembly (30,609 contigs; N50 815 nts) retrieved 15,687 BRBH. We combined these two assemblies into a set of 62,243 non-redundant sequences and identified 139 belonging to plant disease resistance genes of the nucleotide binding leucine-rich repeat class. Based on the non-redundant sequences, we predicted 37,743 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), equivalent to one per 1,142 bp. We estimated the level of heterozygosity as 1.6% in accession 1644 and 30.1% in 2232. The Ae. sharonensis leaf transcriptome provides a rich source of sequence and SNPs for this wild wheat relative. These sequences can be used with existing monocot genome sequences and EST sequence collections (e.g. barley, Brachypodium, wheat, rice, maize and Sorghum) to assist with genetic and physical mapping and candidate gene identification in Ae. sharonensis. These resources provide an initial framework to further build on and characterise the genetic and genomic structure of Ae. sharonensis."
"24151921","articletitle","Use of a large multiparent wheat mapping population in genomic dissection of coleoptile and seedling growth."
"24151921","abstracttext","Identification of alleles towards the selection for improved seedling vigour is a key objective of many wheat breeding programmes. A multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population developed from four commercial spring wheat cultivars (cvv. Baxter, Chara, Westonia and Yitpi) and containing ca. 1000 F(2) -derived, F(6:7) RILs was assessed at two contrasting soil temperatures (12 and 20 °C) for shoot length and coleoptile characteristics length and thickness. Narrow-sense heritabilities were high for coleoptile and shoot length (h(2) = 0.68-0.70), indicating a strong genetic basis for the differences among progeny. Genotypic variation was large, and distributions of genotype means were approximately Gaussian with evidence for transgressive segregation for all traits. A number of significant QTL were identified for all early growth traits, and these were commonly repeatable across the different soil temperatures. The largest negative effects on coleoptile lengths were associated with Rht-B1b (-8.2%) and Rht-D1b (-10.9%) dwarfing genes varying in the population. Reduction in coleoptile length with either gene was particularly large at the warmer soil temperature. Other large QTL for coleoptile length were identified on chromosomes 1A, 2B, 4A, 5A and 6B, but these were relatively smaller than allelic effects at the Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 loci. A large coleoptile length effect allele (a = 5.3 mm at 12 °C) was identified on chromosome 1AS despite the relatively shorter coleoptile length of the donor Yitpi. Strong, positive genetic correlations for coleoptile and shoot lengths (r(g) = 0.85-0.90) support the co-location of QTL for these traits and suggest a common physiological basis for both. The multiparent population has enabled the identification of promising shoot and coleoptile QTL despite the potential for the confounding of large effect dwarfing gene alleles present in the commercial parents. The incidence of these alleles in commercial wheat breeding programmes should facilitate their ready implementation in selection of varieties with improved establishment and early growth."
"24201499","articletitle","Genetic analysis of a grass dwarf mutation induced by wheat callus culture."
"24201499","abstracttext","Genetic variation induced by passage through tissue culture (somaclonal variation) has been characterized for many agronomic traits of wheat. The study presented here was conducted to genetically and phenotypically characterize a mutation influencing plant height that was induced by wheat callus culture. Dwarf plants were identified in the progeny of a tall plant regenerated from immature embryo-derived callus tissue of the hard red winter wheat 'TAM 105'. The dwarfs are significantly shorter, later in heading, and have a greater number of tillers, fewer seeds per spike, lower grain yield per plant, and lower floret fertility than 'TAM 105'. The dwarfs also exhibit branching at the aerial nodes when grown under cool temperatures (<20°C) and short daylengths (<12h). We hypothesize that a single, partially dominant gene which acts in a complementary manner with the grass-dwarf gene D1 is responsible for this phenotype. Based on phenotype and the dominance relationship between mutant and wild-type alleles, we hypothesize that the mutation is a new allele at either the D2 or D4 grass-dwarfism locus. The utilization of genotypes lacking any of the grass-dwarfism alleles would greatly reduce the chance of recovering these undesirable genotypes by mutations arising during tissue culture. It is also important to recognize the grass-dwarf phenotype. If transgenic plants, somatic hybrids, or regenerants from in vitro selection strategies have a grass-dwarf phenotype, they can be induced to enter reproductive development by long daylengths (>14 h) and high temperatures (>26°C)."
"24331419","articletitle","Hydrogen sulfide delays GA-triggered programmed cell death in wheat aleurone layers by the modulation of glutathione homeostasis and heme oxygenase-1 expression."
"24331419","abstracttext","Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is considered as a cellular signaling intermediate in higher plants, but corresponding molecular mechanisms and signal transduction pathways in plant biology are still limited. In the present study, a combination of pharmacological and biochemical approaches was used to study the effect of H2S on the alleviation of GA-induced programmed cell death (PCD) in wheat aleurone cells. The results showed that in contrast with the responses of ABA, GA brought about a gradual decrease of l-cysteine desulfhydrase (LCD) activity and H2S production, and thereafter PCD occurred. Exogenous H2S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) not only effectively blocked the decrease of endogenous H2S release, but also alleviated GA-triggered PCD in wheat aleurone cells. These responses were sensitive to hypotaurine (HT), a H2S scavenger, suggesting that this effect of NaHS was in an H2S-dependent fashion. Further experiment confirmed that H2S, rather than other sodium- or sulphur-containing compounds derived from the decomposing of NaHS, was attributed to the rescuing response. Importantly, the reversing effect was associated with glutathione (GSH) because the NaHS triggered increases of endogenous GSH content and the ratio of GSH/oxidized GSH (GSSG) in GA-treated layers, and the NaHS-mediated alleviation of PCD was markedly eliminated by l-buthionine-sulfoximine (BSO, a selective inhibitor of GSH biosynthesis). The inducible effect of NaHS was also ascribed to the modulation of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), because the specific inhibitor of HO-1 zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) significantly suppressed the NaHS-related responses. By contrast, the above inhibitory effects were reversed partially when carbon monoxide (CO) aqueous solution or bilirubin (BR), two of the by-products of HO-1, was added, respectively. NaHS-triggered HO-1 gene expression in GA-treated layers was also confirmed. Together, the above results clearly suggested that the H2S-delayed PCD in GA-treated wheat aleurone cells was associated with the modulation of GSH homeostasis and HO-1 gene expression."

"24706213","abstracttext","The biological function of mannosylerythritol lipids (MELs) towards their producer, Pseudozyma antarctica, on plant surfaces was investigated. MEL-producing wild-type strain and its MEL production-defective mutant strain (ΔPaEMT1) were compared in terms of their phenotypic traits on the surface of plastic plates, onion peels, and fresh leaves of rice and wheat. While wild-type cells adhering on plastic surfaces and onion peels changed morphologically from single cells to elongated ones for a short period of about 4 h and 1 day, respectively, ΔPaEMT1 cells did not. Microscopic observation of both strains grown on plant leaf surfaces verified that the wild type colonized a significantly bigger area than that of ΔPaEMT1. However, when MELs were exogenously added to the mutant cells on plant surfaces, their colonized area became enlarged. High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed a secretion of higher amount of MELs in the cell suspension incubated with wheat leaf cuttings compared to that in the suspension without cuttings. Transcriptional analysis by real-time reverse transcriptase PCR verified that the expression of erythritol/mannose transferase gene and MELs transporter gene of P. antarctica increased in the cells inoculated onto wheat leaves at 4, 6, and 8 days of incubation, indicating a potential of P. antarctica to produce MELs on the leaves. These findings demonstrate that MELs produced by P. antarctica on plant surfaces could be expected to play a significant role in fungal morphological development and propagation on plant surfaces."

"24970343","abstracttext_key message","Six QTL for adult plant resistance to leaf rust, including two QTL effective against additional diseases, were identified in a RIL population derived from a cross between Shanghai 3/Catbird and Naxos. Leaf rust is an important wheat disease and utilization of adult-plant resistance (APR) may be the best approach to achieve long-term protection from the disease. The CIMMYT spring wheat line Shanghai 3/Catbird (SHA3/CBRD) showed a high level of APR to Chinese Puccinia triticina pathotypes in the field. To identify APR genes in this line, a mapping population of 164 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross of this line and Naxos, a moderately susceptible German cultivar. The RILs were evaluated for final disease severity (FDS) at Baoding, Hebei province, and Zhoukou, Henan province, in the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 cropping seasons. QTL analysis detected one major QTL derived from SHA3/CBRD on chromosome 2BS explaining from 15 to 37 % of the phenotypic variance across environments. In addition one minor resistance QTL on chromosome 1AL from SHA3/CBRD and four minor QTL from Naxos on chromosomes 2DL, 5B, 7BS, and 7DS were also detected. SHA3/CBRD also possessed seedling resistance gene Lr26, and Naxos contained Lr1 based on gene postulation following tests with an array of P. triticina pathotypes and molecular marker assays. These seedling resistance and APR genes and their closely linked molecular markers are potentially useful for improving leaf rust resistance in wheat breeding programs."

"26352804","abstracttext","Soil salinity is considered as one of the most severe abiotic stress factors, which limit plant growth and cause significant losses in crop yield. NAC transcription factors have been proven to play vital roles in abiotic stress signaling in plants. As a staple crop, wheat production is severely constrained by salt stress whereas only a few NAC genes have been characterized functionally. To promote the application of NAC genes in wheat improvement by genetic engineering, a NAC gene designated TaNAC29 was characterized in common wheat. Expression analysis showed that TaNAC29 gene was involved in response to salt, drought and ABA treatments. TaNAC29 protein displays transactivation activity. To determine its role, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TaNAC29 controlled by the CaMV-35S promoter was generated and subjected to salt stress for morphological and physiological assays. Morphological analysis showed that transgenic plants had enhanced tolerance to salt stress, as indicated by improved physiological traits, including more green leaves, reduced H2O2 accumulation, strengthened cell membrane stability and higher SOD, POD, CAT and APX activities. Moreover, the transcript levels of stress-related genes were significantly higher in TaNAC29 overexpression line than those in WT under salt treatment. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TaNAC29 confers salt stress tolerance through reducing H2O2 accumulation and membrane damage by enhancing the antioxidant system, and participating in regulating the abiotic stress-responsive signaling pathway."

"26150821","abstracttext","Ovary pre-conditioned medium and ovary co-culture increased the efficiency of green doubled haploid plant production in bread wheat anther culture. The positive effect of this medium led to a 6- and 11-fold increase in the numbers of embryos and green plants, respectively, having a greater effect on a medium-low responding cultivar. Ovary genotype and developmental stage significantly affected microspore embryogenesis. By the use of Caramba ovaries it was possible to reach a 2-fold increase in the number of embryos and green plants, and to decrease the rate of albinism. Mature ovaries from flowers containing microspores at a late binucleate stage raised the number of embryos and green plants by 25-46% as compared to immature ovaries (excised from flowers with microspores at a mid-late uninucleate stage). The highest numbers of embryos and green plants were produced when using mature Caramba ovaries. Ovaries from Galeón, Tigre, and Kilopondio cultivars successfully induced microspore embryogenesis at the same rate as Caramba ovaries. Moreover, Tigre ovaries raised the percentage of spontaneous chromosome doubling up to 71%. Attempts were made to identify molecular mechanisms associated to the inductive effect of the ovaries on microspore embryogenesis. The genes TAA1b, FLA26, and WALI6 associated to wheat microspore embryogenesis, the CGL1 gene involved in glycan biosynthesis or degradation, and the FER gene involved in the ovary signaling process were expressed and/or induced at different rates during ovary culture. The expression pattern of FLA26 and FER could be related to the differences between genotypes and developmental stages in the inductive effect of the ovary. Our results open opportunities for new approaches to increase bread wheat doubled haploid production by anther culture, and to identify the functional components of the ovary inductive effect on microspore embryogenesis."

"26019483","abstracttext","Intergeneric crop plant hybrid lines with small-segment chromosome translocations are very useful in plant genetic research and breeding. In this study, to create small-segment chromosome translocations with beneficial agronomic characters, the progeny of wheat-rye substitution lines 5R/5A and 6R/6A were selected from generations F 2 to F 5 for rye-specific characteristics. A PCR primer and specific simple sequence repeat marker for rye were used in F 5 populations to detect rye chromatin and to amplify a specific chromosome band in six translocation lines (06-6-5, 06-6-6, 06-6-9, 6-26-1, 7-23, and 7-33). Fragment pSc119.1 cloned from 7-33 had 99% homology with the big ear gene sequence (GenBank AF512607.1) in wheat. The six lines were further characterized via pollen mother cell meiosis analysis for genetic stability, and chromosome C-banding and genomic in situ hybridization for rye chromatin. The results show that line 7-33 was still within the 5R/5A substitution lines and possessed the big ear gene. The other lines all contained small-segment rye chromosome translocations. The results indicated that substitution line hybridization is an effective method for creating small-segment chromosome translocations with useful agronomic traits. Trials for these six wheat-rye translocation lines are justified because they possess many important stably-inherited agronomic characters, including disease resistance and improved yield."

"26471973","abstracttext","The wheat gene Lr34 confers durable and partial field resistance against the obligate biotrophic, pathogenic rust fungi and powdery mildew in adult wheat plants. The resistant Lr34 allele evolved after wheat domestication through two gain-of-function mutations in an ATP-binding cassette transporter gene. An Lr34-like fungal disease resistance with a similar broad-spectrum specificity and durability has not been described in other cereals. Here, we transformed the resistant Lr34 allele into the japonica rice cultivar Nipponbare. Transgenic rice plants expressing Lr34 showed increased resistance against multiple isolates of the hemibiotrophic pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae, the causal agent of rice blast disease. Host cell invasion during the biotrophic growth phase of rice blast was delayed in Lr34-expressing rice plants, resulting in smaller necrotic lesions on leaves. Lines with Lr34 also developed a typical, senescence-based leaf tip necrosis (LTN) phenotype. Development of LTN during early seedling growth had a negative impact on formation of axillary shoots and spikelets in some transgenic lines. One transgenic line developed LTN only at adult plant stage which was correlated with lower Lr34 expression levels at seedling stage. This line showed normal tiller formation and more importantly, disease resistance in this particular line was not compromised. Interestingly, Lr34 in rice is effective against a hemibiotrophic pathogen with a lifestyle and infection strategy that is different from obligate biotrophic rusts and mildew fungi. Lr34 might therefore be used as a source in rice breeding to improve broad-spectrum disease resistance against the most devastating fungal disease of rice."

"26657796","abstracttext","Cytokinin oxidase (CKX) plays a crucial role in plant growth and development by reversibly inactivating cytokinin (CTK). Twenty-four primer pairs, designed from ESTs of the TaCKX genes family of common wheat, were used to identify their allelic variations associated with grain size, weight, and filling rate in 169 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from Jing 411 × Hongmangchun 21. TaCKX6a02, a member of TaCKX gene family, amplified by primer pair T31-32, showed a close association with grain traits in this RIL population. Statistical analysis indicated that allelic variation of TaCKX6a02 had significant correlation with grain size, weight, and filling rate (GFR; P < 0.001) under varied environments. The TaCKX6a02-D1a allele from Jing411 significantly increased grain size, weight and grain filling rate, compared with TaCKX6a02-D1b from Hongmangchun 21. TaCKX6a02 was located on chromosome 3DS in the interval of Xbarc1119 and Xbarc1162, with a genetic distance of 1.4 cM. The location was further confirmed using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines. A major QTL (quantitative trait locus) tightly linked to TaCKX6a02 was detected in the RIL population, explaining 17.1~38.2% of phenotype variations for grain size, weight, GFRmax and GFRmean in different environments. In addition, significant effects of variations of TaCKX6a02 on grain weight and GFR were further validated by association analysis among 102 wheat varieties in two cropping seasons. 12.8~35.1% of phenotypic variations were estimated for these genotypes. A novel 29-bp InDel behind the stop codon was detected by DNA sequence analysis between the two alleles of TaCKX6a02-D1. The gene-specific marker, TKX3D, was designed according to the novel variation, and can be used in marker-assisted selection (MAS) for grain size, weight, and GFR in common wheat."

"26697025","abstracttext","Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis Pers. f. sp. tritici Eriks. and E. Henn. (Pgt), is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat. Races of the pathogen in the ""Ug99 lineage"" are of international concern due to their virulence for widely used stem rust resistance genes and their spread throughout Africa. Disease resistant cultivars provide one of the best means for controlling stem rust. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to African stem rust race TTKSK at the seedling stage, we evaluated an association mapping (AM) panel consisting of 230 tetraploid wheat accessions under greenhouse conditions. A high level of phenotypic variation was observed in response to race TTKSK in the AM panel, allowing for genome-wide association mapping of resistance QTL in wild, landrace, and cultivated tetraploid wheats. Thirty-five resistance QTL were identified on all chromosomes, and seventeen are of particular interest as identified by multiple associations. Many of the identified resistance loci were coincident with previously identified rust resistance genes; however, nine on chromosomes 1AL, 2AL, 4AL, 5BL, and 7BS may be novel. To validate AM results, a biparental population of 146 recombinant inbred lines was also considered, which derived from a cross between the resistant cultivar ""Cirillo"" and susceptible ""Neodur."" The stem rust resistance of Cirillo was conferred by a single gene on the distal region of chromosome arm 6AL in an interval map coincident with the resistance gene Sr13, and confirmed one of the resistance loci identified by AM. A search for candidate resistance genes was carried out in the regions where QTL were identified, and many of them corresponded to NBS-LRR genes and protein kinases with LRR domains. The results obtained in the present study are of great interest as a high level of genetic variability for resistance to race TTKSK was described in a germplasm panel comprising most of the tetraploid wheat sub-species."

The present study performed comparative spatiotemporal transcriptomic analysis of seed maturation in two wheat genotypes with contrasting seed weight/size and dormancy phenotype."
"28915785","abstracttext_results","The embryo and endosperm tissues of maturing seeds appeared to exhibit genotype-specific temporal shifts in gene expression profile that might contribute to the seed phenotypic variations. Functional annotations of gene clusters suggest that the two tissues exhibit distinct but genotypically overlapping molecular functions. Motif enrichment predicts genotypically distinct abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) regulated transcriptional networks contribute to the contrasting seed weight/size and dormancy phenotypes between the two genotypes. While other ABA responsive element (ABRE) motifs are enriched in both genotypes, the prevalence of G-box-like motif specifically in tissues of the dormant genotype suggests distinct ABA mediated transcriptional mechanisms control the establishment of dormancy during seed maturation. In agreement with this, the bZIP transcription factors that co-express with ABRE enriched embryonic genes differ with genotype. The enrichment of SITEIIATCYTC motif specifically in embryo clusters of maturing seeds irrespective of genotype predicts a tissue specific role for the respective TCP transcription factors with no or minimal contribution to the variations in seed dormancy."

"27217549","abstracttext","The precocious germination of cereal grains before harvest, also known as pre-harvest sprouting, is an important source of yield and quality loss in cereal production. Pre-harvest sprouting is a complex grain defect and is becoming an increasing challenge due to changing climate patterns. Resistance to sprouting is multi-genic, although a significant proportion of the sprouting variation in modern wheat cultivars is controlled by a few major quantitative trait loci, including Phs-A1 in chromosome arm 4AL. Despite its importance, little is known about the physiological basis and the gene(s) underlying this important locus. In this study, we characterized Phs-A1 and show that it confers resistance to sprouting damage by affecting the rate of dormancy loss during dry seed after-ripening. We show Phs-A1 to be effective even when seeds develop at low temperature (13 °C). Comparative analysis of syntenic Phs-A1 intervals in wheat and Brachypodium uncovered ten orthologous genes, including the Plasma Membrane 19 genes (PM19-A1 and PM19-A2) previously proposed as the main candidates for this locus. However, high-resolution fine-mapping in two bi-parental UK mapping populations delimited Phs-A1 to an interval 0.3 cM distal to the PM19 genes. This study suggests the possibility that more than one causal gene underlies this major pre-harvest sprouting locus. The information and resources reported in this study will help test this hypothesis across a wider set of germplasm and will be of importance for breeding more sprouting resilient wheat varieties."

"28597430","abstracttext_background","Wheat, one of the most important crops, has a detrimental effect on both yield and quality under drought stress. As our preliminary experiment showed that the Chinese Spring wheat-Aegilops longissima chromosome substitution line CS-1S l (1B) had a better drought tolerance than CS, the substitution line CS-1S l (1B) was used to identify drought stress related proteins by means of a comparative proteome approach in this work. Our present study aimed to explore the gene resources for drought resistance in 1S l genome."
"28597430","abstracttext_result","Our results showed that drought stress induced downregulation of relative water and chlorophyll contents and the upregulation of proline content, and further influencing grain filling shortening and significant decrease of plant height, B-type starch granule numbers, grain number and weight. In total, 25 grain albumin and globulin protein spots were found to be specifically encoded by the 1S l chromosome. In addition, 17 protein spots respected 13 unique proteins were identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, which were mainly involved in adverse defense and gluten quality. Among them, ascorbate peroxidase, serpin-Z2B and alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor were upregulated under drought stress. These proteins play important roles in plant drought defenses through various metabolic pathways."

"27738714","articletitle","Transcription factors involved in drought tolerance and their possible role in developing drought tolerant cultivars with emphasis on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"27738714","abstracttext_key message","TFs involved in drought tolerance in plants may be utilized in future for developing drought tolerant cultivars of wheat and some other crops. Plants have developed a fairly complex stress response system to deal with drought and other abiotic stresses. These response systems often make use of transcription factors (TFs); a gene encoding a specific TF together with -its target genes constitute a regulon, and take part in signal transduction to activate/silence genes involved in response to drought. Since, five specific families of TFs (out of >80 known families of TFs) have gained widespread attention on account of their significant role in drought tolerance in plants, TFs and regulons belonging to these five multi-gene families (AP2/EREBP, bZIP, MYB/MYC, NAC and WRKY) have been described and their role in improving drought tolerance discussed in this brief review. These TFs often undergo reversible phosphorylation to perform their function, and are also involved in complex networks. Therefore, some details about reversible phosphorylation of TFs by different protein kinases/phosphatases and the co-regulatory networks, which involve either only TFs or TFs with miRNAs, have also been discussed. Literature on transgenics involving genes encoding TFs and that on QTLs and markers associated with TF genes involved in drought tolerance has also been reviewed. Throughout the review, there is a major emphasis on wheat as an important crop, although examples from the model cereal rice (sometimes maize also), and the model plant Arabidopsis have also been used. This knowledge base may eventually allow the use of TF genes for development of drought tolerant cultivars, particularly in wheat."
"27866225","articletitle","Characterization of a common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) high-tillering dwarf mutant."
"27866225","abstracttext_key message","A novel high-tillering dwarf mutant in common wheat Wangshuibai was characterized and mapped to facilitate breeding for plant height and tiller and the future cloning of the causal gene. Tiller number and plant height are two major agronomic traits in cereal crops affecting plant architecture and grain yield. NAUH167, a mutant of common wheat landrace Wangshuibai induced by ethylmethyl sulfide (EMS) treatment, exhibits higher tiller number and reduced plant height. Microscope observation showed that the dwarf phenotype was attributed to the decrease in the number of cells and their length. The same as the wild type, the mutant was sensitive to exogenous gibberellins. Genetic analysis showed that the high-tillering number and dwarf phenotype were related and controlled by a partial recessive gene. Using a RIL 2:6 population derived from the cross NAUH167/Sumai3, a molecular marker-based genetic map was constructed. The map consisted of 283 loci, spanning a total length of 1007.98 cM with an average markers interval of 3.56 cM. By composite interval mapping, a stable major QTL designated QHt.nau-2D controlling both traits, was mapped to the short arm of chromosome 2D flanked by markers Xcfd11 and Xgpw361. To further map the QHt.nau-2D loci, another population consisted of 180 F 2 progeny from a cross 2011I-78/NAUH167 was constructed. Finally, QHt.nau-2D was located within a genetic region of 0.8 cM between markers QHT239 and QHT187 covering a predicted physical distance of 6.77 Mb. This research laid the foundation for map-based cloning of QHt.nau-2D and would facilitate the characterization of plant height and tiller number in wheat."

"27866228","abstracttext_key message","Fine mapping of Yr47 and Lr52 in chromosome arm 5BS of wheat identified close linkage of the marker sun180 to both genes and its robustness for marker-assisted selection was demonstrated. The widely effective and genetically linked rust resistance genes Yr47 and Lr52 have previously been mapped in the short arm of chromosome 5B in two F 3 populations (Aus28183/Aus27229 and Aus28187/Aus27229). The Aus28183/Aus27229 F 3 population was advanced to generate an F 6 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population to identify markers closely linked with Yr47 and Lr52. Diverse genomic resources including flow-sorted chromosome survey sequence contigs representing the orthologous region in Brachypodium distachyon, the physical map of chromosome arm 5BS, expressed sequence tags (ESTs) located in the 5BS6-0.81-1.00 deletion bin and resistance gene analog contigs of chromosome arm 5BS were used to develop markers to saturate the target region. Selective genotyping was also performed using the iSelect 90 K Infinium wheat SNP assay. A set of SSR, STS, gene-based and SNP markers were developed and genotyped on the Aus28183/Aus27229 RIL population. Yr47 and Lr52 are genetically distinct genes that mapped 0.4 cM apart in the RIL population. The SSR marker sun180 co-segregated with Lr52 and mapped 0.4 cM distal to Yr47. In a high resolution mapping population of 600 F 2 genotypes Yr47 and Lr52 mapped 0.2 cM apart and marker sun180 was placed 0.4 cM distal to Lr52. The amplification of a different sun180 amplicon (195 bp) than that linked with Yr47 and Lr52 (200 bp) in 204 diverse wheat genotypes demonstrated its robustness for marker-assisted selection of these genes."

"27898771","abstracttext","Wheat kernel shape and size has been under selection since early domestication. Kernel morphology is a major consideration in wheat breeding, as it impacts grain yield and quality. A population of 160 recombinant inbred lines (RIL), developed using an elite (ND 705) and a nonadapted genotype (PI 414566), was extensively phenotyped in replicated field trials and genotyped using Infinium iSelect 90K assay to gain insight into the genetic architecture of kernel shape and size. A high density genetic map consisting of 10,172 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers, with an average marker density of 0.39 cM/marker, identified a total of 29 genomic regions associated with six grain shape and size traits; ∼80% of these regions were associated with multiple traits. The analyses showed that kernel length (KL) and width (KW) are genetically independent, while a large number (∼59%) of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for kernel shape traits were in common with genomic regions associated with kernel size traits. The most significant QTL was identified on chromosome 4B, and could be an ortholog of major rice grain size and shape gene or . Major and stable loci also were identified on the homeologous regions of Group 5 chromosomes, and in the regions of (6A) and (7A) genes. Both parental genotypes contributed equivalent positive QTL alleles, suggesting that the nonadapted germplasm has a great potential for enhancing the gene pool for grain shape and size. This study provides new knowledge on the genetic dissection of kernel morphology, with a much higher resolution, which may aid further improvement in wheat yield and quality using genomic tools."

"29468459","abstracttext_key message","The dwarfing gene Rht24 on chromosome 6A acts in the wheat population 'Solitär × Bussard', considerably reducing plant height without increasing Fusarium head blight severity and delaying heading stage. The introduction of the Reduced height (Rht)-B1 and Rht-D1 semi-dwarfing genes led to remarkable increases in wheat yields during the Green Revolution. However, their utilization also brings about some unwanted characteristics, including the increased susceptibility to Fusarium head blight. Thus, Rht loci that hold the potential to reduce plant height in wheat without concomitantly increasing Fusarium head blight (FHB) susceptibility are urgently required. The biparental population 'Solitär × Bussard' fixed for the Rht-1 wild-type alleles, but segregating for the recently described gibberellic acid (GA)-sensitive Rht24 gene, was analyzed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for FHB severity, plant height, and heading date and to evaluate the effect of the Rht24 locus on these traits. The most prominent QTL was Rht24 on chromosome 6A explaining 51% of genotypic variation for plant height and exerting an additive effect of - 4.80 cm. For FHB severity three QTL were detected, whereas five and six QTL were found for plant height and heading date, respectively. No FHB resistance QTL was co-localized with QTL for plant height. Unlike the Rht-1 semi-dwarfing alleles, Rht24b did not significantly affect FHB severity. This demonstrates that the choice of semi-dwarfing genes used in plant breeding programs is of utmost consideration where resistance to FHB is an important breeding target."

"29403525","abstracttext","Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident cell death suppressor evolutionarily conserved in eukaryotes. The ability of BI-1 to inhibit the biotic and abiotic stresses have been well-studied in Arabidopsis , while the functions of wheat BI-1 are largely unknown. In this study, the wheat BI-1 gene TaBI-1.1 was isolated by an RNA-seq analysis of Fusarium graminearum ( Fg )-treated wheat. TaBI-1.1 expression was induced by a salicylic acid (SA) treatment and down-regulated by an abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Based on β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining, TaBI-1.1 was expressed in mature leaves and roots but not in the hypocotyl or young leaves. Constitutive expression of TaBI-1.1 in Arabidopsis enhanced its resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato ( Pst ) DC3000 infection and induced SA-related gene expression. Additionally, TaBI-1.1 transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited an alleviation of damage caused by high concentrations of SA and decreased the sensitivity to ABA. Consistent with the phenotype, the RNA-seq analysis of 35S::TaBI-1.1 and Col-0 plants showed that TaBI-1.1 was involved in biotic stresses. These results suggested that TaBI-1.1 positively regulates SA signals and plays important roles in the response to biotic stresses. In addition, TaBI-1.1 interacted with the aquaporin TaPIP1, and both them were localized to ER membrane. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TaPIP1 was up-regulated by SA treatment and TaPIP1 transgenic Arabidopsis enhanced the resistance to Pst DC3000 infection. Thus, the interaction between TaBI-1.1 and TaPIP1 on the ER membrane probably occurs in response to SA signals and defense response."
"29396589","articletitle","A new leaf rust resistance gene Lr79 mapped in chromosome 3BL from the durum wheat landrace Aus26582."
"29396589","abstracttext_key message","A new leaf rust resistance gene Lr79 has been mapped in the long arm of chromosome 3B and a linked marker was identified for marker-assisted selection. Aus26582, a durum wheat landrace from the A. E. Watkins Collection, showed seedling resistance against durum-specific and common wheat-specific Puccinia triticina (Pt) pathotypes. Genetic analysis using a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed from a cross between Aus26582 and the susceptible parent Bansi with Australian Pt pathotype showed digenic inheritance and the underlying loci were temporarily named LrAW2 and LrAW3. LrAW2 was located in chromosome 6BS and this study focused on characterisation of LrAW3 using RILs lacking LrAW2. LrAW3 was incorporated into the DArTseq map of Aus26582/Bansi and was located in chromosome 3BL. Markers linked with LrAW3 were developed from the chromosome survey sequence contig 3B_10474240 in which closely-linked DArTseq markers 1128708 and 3948563 were located. Although bulk segregant analysis (BSA) with the 90 K Infinium array identified 51 SNPs associated with LrAW3, only one SNP-derived KASP marker mapped close to the locus. Deletion bin mapping of LrAW3-linked markers located LrAW3 between bins 3BL11-0.85-0.90 and 3BL7-0.63. Since no other all stage leaf rust resistance gene is located in chromosome 3BL, LrAW3 represented a new locus and was designated Lr79. Marker sun786 mapped 1.8 cM distal to Lr79 and Aus26582 was null for this locus. However, the marker can be reliably scored as it also amplifies a monomorphic fragment that serves as an internal control to differentiate the null status of Aus26582 from reaction failure. This marker was validated among a set of durum and common wheat cultivars and was shown to be useful for marker-assisted selection of Lr79 at both ploidy levels."

"29414315","abstracttext","Expansins play an important role in plant stress tolerance. In a previous study, we cloned the wheat expansin gene TaEXPA2. Here, we analyze its involvement in oxidative stress tolerance. First, we observed that the expression of TaEXPA2 in wheat seedlings was upregulated during H 2 O 2 stress. Then, we assembled a TaEXPA2 gene expression vector, transformed it to Arabidopsis, and obtained transgenic plants overexpressing TaEXPA2 (labeled OE). When exposed to H 2 O 2 , both OE and wild-type (Col) plants were damaged by oxidative stress, as indicated by decolored leaves and increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content. Damage in OE plants was less severe than in Col plants (WT), and this was accompanied by higher activity of cell wall peroxidase (POD) enzymes, including soluble POD, ionically bound POD, and covalently bound POD. The expansin activities of the OE plants were also higher than WT under oxidative stress. We further obtained the Arabidopsis mutant atexpa2 (AtEXPA2 is homologous to TaEXPA2), and found that the antioxidant ability of atexpa2 was lower than that in Col plants, accompanied by depressed activity of POD enzymes and expansins in cell walls. We transformed wheat TaEXPA2 to atexpa2 and obtained plants (labeled Rs) capable of recovering the antioxidant capacity. Oxidative stress tolerance in Rs plants was higher than that of Col plants, and the Rs plants also had higher levels of cell wall POD enzyme and expansin activity. Finally, we identified 13 POD genes in Arabidopsis thaliana and analyzed their expression patterns using quantitative real-time PCR. The expression of 4 of these genes (AtPOD31, AtPOD33, AtPOD34 and AtPOD71) was significantly upregulated during exposure to H 2 O 2 . We speculate that the 4 genes upregulated by H 2 O 2 treatment are involved in the increased activity of POD in the cell wall. We suggest that TaEXPA2 may regulate antioxidant capacity in plants by regulating the activity of cell wall peroxidase."

"28756347","abstracttext","The aim of the experiment was to determine phytohormone profile of triticale and quality-based relationships between the analyzed groups of phytohormones. The study involved two triticale phenotypes, a long-stemmed one and a semi-dwarf one with Dw1 gene, differing in mechanisms of acclimation to drought and controlled by wheat or rye genome. Water deficit in the leaves triggered a specific phytohormone response in both winter triticale phenotypes attributable to the dominance of wheat (semi-dwarf cultivar) or rye (long-stemmed cultivar) genome. Rye genome in long-stemmed triticale was responsible for specific increase (tillering: gibberellic acid; heading: N6-isopentenyladenine, trans-zeatin-9-riboside, cis-zeatin-9-riboside; flowering: N6-isopentenyladenine, indolebutyric acid, salicylic acid) or decrease (heading: trans-zeatin) in the content of some phytohormones. Wheat genome in semi-dwarf triticale controlled a specific increase in trans-zeatin content at heading and anthesis in gibberellin A1 during anthesis. The greatest number of changes in the phytohormone levels was observed in the generative phase. In both triticale types, the pool of investigated phytohormones was dominated by abscisic acid and gibberellins. The semi-dwarf cultivar with Dw1 gene was less sensitive to gibberellins and its mechanisms of acclimation to water stress were mainly ABA-dependent. An increase in ABA and gibberellins during drought and predominance of these hormones in the total pool of analyzed phytohormones indicated their equal share in drought acclimation mechanisms in long-stemmed cultivar."

"29032425","abstracttext_key message","Expression of TaRUB1 gene in Arabidopsis thaliana elevates the level of disease-related genes in response to pathogen invasion through the accumulation of callose, necrotic cells, and the outbreak of ROS. Ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like proteins are highly conserved in sequence and can covalently bind and modify many intracellular proteins which can be recognized and degraded by 26S proteasome. Post-translational modification of proteins has become a hot research spot today. In the previous study, a cDNA of related-to-ubiquitin protein belonged to ubiquitin-like proteins, whose spatial structure comprised Ub and NEDD8, was obtained from wheat SN6306 by suppression-subtractive hybridization and was named TaRUB1. TaRUB1 is induced by wheat powdery mildew and significantly upregulated in resistant wheat SN6306. In this study, heterologous expression of TaRUB1 in A. thaliana was used to study the function of this gene in response to pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. Tomato DC3000 (Pst DC3000). Transgenic A. thaliana showed relatively fewer disease symptoms, accompanied by common inhibition of living body parasitic defense responses, accumulation of more callose and reactive oxygen species (ROS), and concentrated cell death, simultaneously antioxidant enzyme activities of superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and ascorbate peroxidase were higher than those in wild-type (WT) plant after infection with Pst DC3000. Meanwhile, hypersensitive cell death, which was possibly ROS burst, was also observed in transgenic A. thaliana. By quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis, some marker genes for hypersensitive response showed significantly higher transcriptional expression level in transgenic A. thaliana, which activates system-acquired resistance, than that of WT plants. Heterologous expression of TaRUB1 can significantly enhance resistance to Pst DC3000 in A. thaliana, suggesting that TaRUB1 is related to plant disease resistance."

To this end, the PS accumulation in the nutrient solution and the root expression of the genes encoding the nicotianamine aminotransferase (TaNAAT) and ferritin (TaFER) have been evaluated in plants subjected to different treatments."

Moreover, the application of IAA to Fe-sufficient plants promoted both PS root release and TaNAAT gene expression thus indicating that auxin might be involved in the shoot to root signaling network regulating Fe-deficiency root responses in wheat."

"30991719","abstracttext","Nitrogen (N) is one of the essential macronutrients that plays an important role in plant growth and development. Unfortunately, low utilization rate of nitrogen has become one of the main abiotic factors affecting crop growth. Nevertheless, little research has been done on the molecular mechanism of wheat seedlings resisting or adapting to low nitrogen environment. In this paper, the response of wheat seedlings against low nitrogen stress at phenotypic changes and gene expression level were studied. The results showed that plant height, leaf area, shoot and root dry weight, total root length, and number under low nitrogen stress decreased by 26.0, 28.1, 24.3, 38.0, 41.4, and 21.2 percent, respectively compared with plants under normal conditions. 2265 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in roots and 2083 DEGs were detected in leaves under low nitrogen stress (N-) compared with the control (CK). 1688 genes were up-regulated and 577 genes were down-regulated in roots, whilst 505 genes were up-regulated and 1578 were down-regulated in leaves. Among the most addressed Gene Ontology (GO) categories, oxidation reduction process, oxidoreductase activity, and cell component were mostly represented. In addition, genes involved in the signal transduction, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, antioxidant activity, and environmental adaptation were highlighted. Our study provides new information for further understanding the response of wheat to low nitrogen stress."

By using Breeders' 35K Axiom array in a comprehensive genome-wide association study covering 4364.79 cM of the wheat genome and applying a compressed mixed linear model, a total of 146 SNPs (-log 10 P ≥ 4) were found associated with 23 traits out of 36 traits studied explaining 3.7-47.0% of phenotypic variance. To reveal this a subset of 260 genotypes was characterized phenotypically for six quantitative traits [days to heading (DTH), days to maturity (DTM), plant height (PH), spike length (SL), awn length (Awn_L), and leaf length (Leaf_L)] under five environments. Gene annotations mined ∼38 putative candidate genes which were confirmed using tissue and stage specific gene expression data from RNA Seq. We observed strong co-localized loci for four traits (glume pubescence, SL, PH, and awn color) on chromosome 1B (24.64 cM) annotated five putative candidate genes. This study led to the discovery of hitherto unreported loci for some less explored traits (such as leaf sheath wax, awn attitude, and glume pubescence) besides the refined chromosomal regions of known loci associated with the traits. This study provides valuable information of the genetic loci and their potential genes underlying the traits such as awn characters which are being considered as important contributors toward yield enhancement."

"32180780","abstracttext","The fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis ( Ptr ) causes tan spot, a destructive foliar disease of wheat worldwide. The pathogen produces several necrotrophic effectors, which induce necrosis or chlorosis on susceptible wheat lines. Multiple races of Ptr have been identified, based on their ability to produce one or more of these effectors. Ptr has a wide host range of cereal and non-cereal grasses, but is known to cause damage only on wheat. Previously, we showed that Ptr can interact specifically with cultivated barley ( Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare ), and that the necrotrophic effector Ptr ToxB induces mild chlorosis in a highly selective manner when infiltrated into certain barley genotypes. In the present study, a barley doubled-haploid (DH) population was evaluated for reaction to Ptr race 5, a Ptr ToxB-producer. Then a comprehensive genetic map composed of 381 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers was used to map the locus conditioning this chlorosis. The F1 seedlings, and 92 DH lines derived from a cross between the resistant Japanese malting barley cultivar Haruna Nijo and the susceptible wild barley ( H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum ) OUH602 were inoculated with a conidial suspension of Ptr race 5 isolate at the two-leaf stage. The seedlings were monitored daily for symptoms and assessed for chlorosis development on the second leaf, 6 days after inoculation. All tested F1 seedlings exhibited chlorosis symptoms similar to the susceptible parent, and the DH lines segregated 1:1 for susceptible:resistant phenotypes, indicating the involvement of a single locus. Marker-trait linkage analysis based on interval mapping identified a single locus on the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 2H. We designate this locus Susceptibility to P. tritici-repentis 1 ( Spr1 ). The region encompassing this locus has 99 high confidence gene models, including membrane receptor-like kinases (RLKs), intracellular nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs), and ankyrin-repeat proteins (ANKs). This shows the involvement of a dominant locus conferring susceptibility to Ptr in barley. Further work using high-resolution mapping and transgenic complementation will be required to identify the underlying gene."

"32196909","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is one of the most destructive fungal diseases in wheat production worldwide. The hypersensitive reaction (HR) is an important defence response against P. triticina infection. In this study, the physiological races 165 and 260 of P. triticina were combined with a line derived from the bread wheat cultivar Thatcher with the leaf rust resistance locus Lr26 to form compatible and incompatible combinations, respectively. Based on an RNA-Seq database of the interaction systems, a new wheat cysteine-rich receptor-like kinase gene, TaCRK2, is specifically induced and up-regulated in the incompatible combination. We identified that TaCRK2 was regulated in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner. Knockdown of TaCRK2 by virus-induced gene silencing and RNAi leads to a dramatic increase in HR area and the number of haustorial mother cells at the single infection site. In addition, urediniospores, a P. triticina-specific pathogenic marker in compatible combinations, were observed on leaf surfaces of silenced plants at approximately 15 days after inoculation in the incompatible combination. Moreover, transcription levels of TaPR1, TaPR2, and TaPR5 were obviously reduced in TaCRK2-silenced plants. TaCRK2 overexpression in Nicotiana benthamiana induced strong HR-like cell death. Finally, transient expression of green fluorescent protein fused with TaCRK2 in N. benthamiana indicated that TaCRK2 localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum. Thus, TaCRK2 plays an important role in the resistance to P. triticina infection and has a positive regulation effect on the HR cell death process induced by P. triticina."

During the present study, high-throughput RNA-Seq analysis was used to gain insights into the role of Lr28 gene in imparting seedling leaf rust resistance in wheat. Differential expression analysis was conducted using a pair of near-isogenic lines (NILs) (HD 2329 and HD 2329+Lr28) at early (0h before inoculation (hbi), 24 and 48h after inoculation (hai)) and late stages (72, 96 and 168 hai) after inoculation with a virulent pathotype of pathogen Puccinia triticina. Expression of a large number of genes was found to be affected due to the presence/absence of Lr28. Gene ontology analysis of the differentially expressed transcripts suggested enrichment of transcripts involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, oxidative stress and hormone metabolism, in resistant and/or susceptible NILs. Genes encoding receptor like kinases (RLKs) (including ATP binding; serine threonine kinases) and other kinases were the most abundant class of genes, whose expression was affected. Genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis and several genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) (most abundant being WRKY TFs) were also identified along with some ncRNAs and histone variants. Quantitative real-time PCR was also used for validation of 39 representative selected genes. In the long term, the present study should prove useful in developing leaf rust resistant wheat cultivars through molecular breeding."

Bulked segregant analysis and simple sequence repeat mapping with 200 F 2 plants showed that PmDTM was located in the same genetic region as Pm24 on chromosome 1DS. To fine map PmDTM , 12 critical recombinants were identified from 1,192 F 2 plants and delimited PmDTM to a 0.5-cM Xhnu58800 to Xhnu59000 interval covering 180.5 Kb (38,728,125 to 38,908,656 bp) on chromosome 1DS, and only one highly confident gene, TraesCS1D02G058900 , was annotated within this region. TraesCS1D02G058900 encodes a receptor-like serine/threonine-protein kinase (STK), and a 6-bp deletion in exon 5 may confer the resistance to powdery mildew. Allele frequency analysis indicated that the STK allele with 6-bp deletion was only present in three landraces (Datoumai, Chiyacao [ Pm24 ], and Hulutou) and was absent in all of the 353 Chinese modern cultivars and 147 foreign cultivars. These results demonstrate that PmDTM is mapped to the same locus as Pm24 and can be widely used to enhance powdery mildew resistance in wheat growing regions worldwide."

"32481111","abstracttext","An expressed sequence tag (EST) highly similar to BdPT1-4, a phosphate transporter (PT) gene in Brachypodium distachyon, was obtained in a wheat root cDNA subtractive suppression library containing genes that respond to low-phosphate (Pi) stress. The DNA sequence covering this EST (designated as TaPht1;4) was determined based on screening a wheat DNA library. TaPht1;4 consists of two exons and one intron and encodes a 555 amino acid (aa) polypeptide with a molecular weight of 60.85kDa and an isoelectric point of 7.60. TaPht1;4 contains 12 conserved membrane-spanning domains similar to previously reported PTs in diverse plant species. Yeast complement analysis in low-Pi medium confirmed that TaPht1;4 confers the capacity to uptake Pi to MB192, a yeast strain with a defective high-affinity PT; with an apparent Km of 35.3μM. The TaPht1;4 transcripts were specifically detected in the root and were highly induced under Pi deficiency. TaPht1;4 was also expressed following a diurnal pattern, i.e. high levels during daytime and low levels during night-time. TaPht1;4 overexpression and downregulation dramatically altered the plant phenotypic features under low-Pi conditions. Samples that overexpressed TaPht1;4 had significantly improved growth traits and accumulated more Pi than the wild-type plant and those with downregulated TaPht1;4 expression. Therefore, TaPht1;4 is a high-affinity PT gene that plays a critical role in wheat Pi acquisition under Pi deprivation."

"30030900","abstracttext","Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) can trigger plant immunity through the recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. In this study, we report that a malectin-like/leucine-rich repeat receptor protein kinase gene, RLK-V, from Haynaldia villosa putatively acts as a PRR to positively regulate powdery mildew resistance caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) in wheat. RLK-V has two alternatively spliced transcripts corresponding to an intact RLK-V1.1 and a truncated RLK-V1.2 caused by intron retention. Expression analysis showed that both transcripts could be up-regulated by Bgt in resistant materials, whereas the functional RLK-V1.1 was expressed only after Bgt inoculation. Promoter activity assays indicated that RLK-V could respond to Bgt even in susceptible wheat. Silencing of RLK-V in Pm21-carrying resistant materials resulted in compromised resistance to Bgt. In addition, over-expression of RLK-V1.1 in Pm21-lacking susceptible Yangmai158 and SM-1 by single-cell transient expression and stable transformation in Yangmai158 could improve powdery mildew resistance. We propose that RLK-V regulates basal resistance to powdery mildew, which is also required for broad-spectrum resistance mediated by the Pm21 gene. Over-expression of RLK-V1.1 could trigger cell death in Nicotiana benthamiana, and RLK-V1.1 transgenic wheat accumulated more reactive oxygen species and displayed a stronger hypersensitive response than did the recipient, which led to enhanced Bgt resistance. However, constitutive activation of RLK-V1.1 resulted in the abnormal growth of transgenic plants."

"30065786","abstracttext_background","During the process of bioethanol production, cellulose is hydrolyzed into its monomeric soluble units. For efficient hydrolysis, a chemical and/or mechanical pretreatment step is required. Such pretreatment is designed to increase enzymatic digestibility of the cellulose chains inter alia by de-crystallization of the cellulose chains and by removing barriers, such as lignin from the plant cell wall. Biological pretreatment, in which lignin is decomposed or modified by white-rot fungi, has also been considered. One disadvantage in biological pretreatment, however, is the consumption of the cellulose by the fungus. Thus, fungal species that attack lignin with only minimal cellulose loss are advantageous. The secretomes of white-rot fungi contain carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) including lignin-modifying enzymes. Thus, modification of secretome composition can alter the ratio of lignin/cellulose degradation."
"30065786","abstracttext_results","Pleurotus ostreatus PC9 was genetically modified to either overexpress or eliminate (by gene replacement) the transcriptional regulator CRE1, known to act as a repressor in the process of carbon catabolite repression. The cre1 -overexpressing transformant demonstrated lower secreted cellulolytic activity and slightly increased selectivity (based on the chemical composition of pretreated wheat straw), whereas the knockout transformant demonstrated increased cellulolytic activity and significantly reduced residual cellulose, thereby displaying lower selectivity. Pretreatment of wheat straw using the wild-type PC9 resulted in 2.8-fold higher yields of soluble sugar compared to untreated wheat straw. The overexpression transformant showed similar yields (2.6-fold), but the knockout transformant exhibited lower yields (1.2-fold) of soluble sugar. Based on proteomic secretome analysis, production of numerous CAZymes was affected by modification of the expression level of cre1 ."
"30065786","abstracttext_conclusions","The gene cre1 functions as a regulator for expression of fungal CAZymes active against plant cell wall lignocelluloses, hence altering the substrate preference of the fungi tested. While the cre1 knockout resulted in a less efficient biological pretreatment, i.e., less saccharification of the treated biomass, the converse manipulation of cre1 (overexpression) failed to improve efficiency. Despite the inverse nature of the two genetic alterations, the expected ""mirror image"" (i.e., opposite regulatory response) was not observed, indicating that the secretion level of CAZymes, was not exclusively dependent on CRE1 activity."

"30727210","abstracttext","Certain Fusarium species cause Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and other small grains. Differences in characteristics of the pathogen species/isolates used in breeding programs may affect reaction of host genotypes, leading to erroneous results. To clarify differences among Fusarium isolates from different geographical zones, the phylogenetic, chemotypic, and pathogenic abilities of 58 isolates collected from three wheat-producing countries (Canada, Mexico, and Iran) were investigated. Phylogenetic relationships among the isolates were characterized using the Tri101 gene sequence. All Canadian and Iranian isolates clustered in one group and were identified as F. graminearum lineage 7 (=F. graminearum sensu stricto) within the F. graminearum (Fg) clade. The isolates from Mexico were identified as either F. graminearum lineage 3 (=Fusarium boothii) within the Fg clade or Fusarium crookwellense. A polymerase chain reaction assay based on the Tri12 gene identified three trichothecene chemotypes of 15-ADON, 3- ADON, and NIV, with 15-ADON being the most common. All F. boothii isolates from Mexico were of the 15-ADON chemotype, while all F. crookwellense isolates were determined to be NIV producers. While we did not find the NIV chemotype among the Canadian isolates, 25.6% of the Iranian isolates were determined to be NIV producers. High level of variation in aggressiveness was also observed among and within the species tested: F. graminearum sensu stricto isolates were the most aggressive, followed by those of F. boothii, and lastly by F. crookwellense. The differences observed among the isolates may explain why wheat lines/cultivars demonstrate different reactions to FHB in different geographical zones."

"32424640","abstracttext","Recently, leaf rust and yellow rust caused by the fungi Puccinia triticina Erikss. and P. striiformis Westend f. sp. tritici Eriks and Henn are diseases of increasing threat in triticale (× Triticosecale Wittmack, AABBRR, 2n = 6x = 42) growing areas. The use of genetic resistance is considered the most economical, effective and environmentally friendly method to control the disease and minimize the use of fungicides. Currently, breeding programs mainly relied on race-specific Lr and Yr genes (R), but new races of the rust fungi frequently defeat resistance. There is a small group of genes that causes partial type of resistance (PR) that are characterized by a slow epidemic build up despite a high infection type. In wheat slow rusting resistance genes displayed longer latent periods, low infection frequencies, smaller pustule size and less spore production. Slow rusting Lr46/Yr29 gene, located on chromosome 1B, is being exploited in many wheat breeding programs. So far, there is no information about slow rusting genes in triticale. This paper showed significant differences between the results of identification of wheat molecular markers Xwmc44 and csLV46G22 associated with Lr46/Yr29 in twenty triticale cultivars, which were characterized by high levels of field resistance to leaf and yellow rust. The csLV46G22res marker has been identified in the following cultivars: Kasyno, Mamut and Puzon. Belcanto and Kasyno showed the highest resistance levels in three-year (2016-2018), leaf and yellow rust severity tests under post-registration variety testing program (PDO). Leaf tip necrosis, a phenotypic trait associated with Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29 was observed, among others, to Belcanto and Kasyno, which showed the highest resistance for leaf rust and yellow rust. Kasyno could be considered to have Lr46/Yr29 and can be used as a source of slow rust resistance in breeding and importantly as a component of gene pyramiding in triticale."

"30694146","abstracttext","Wheat breeders worldwide are seeking new sources of resistance to Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK. To prioritize field-resistant landraces for follow-up genetic studies to test for the presence of new resistance genes, seedling response to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK, molecular markers linked to specific Sr genes, segregation ratios among progeny from crosses, and bulked segregant analyses (BSA) were used. In total, 33 spring wheat landraces with seedling resistance to P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK were crossed to a susceptible genotype, LMPG-6. The segregation ratios of stem rust reactions in F 2 seedlings fit a single dominant gene model in 31 populations and progeny from two crosses gave ambiguous results. Using the 90K wheat single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping platform, BSA showed that the seedling resistance in 29 accessions is probably controlled by loci on chromosome 2BL. For the three remaining accessions, BSA revealed that the seedling resistance is most likely controlled by previously unreported genes. For confirmation, two populations were advanced to the F 2:3 and screened against P. graminis f. sp. tritici race TTKSK. Segregation of the F 2:3 families fit a 1:2:1 ratio for a single dominant gene. Using the F 2:3 families, BSA located the TTKSK locus on chromosome 6DS to the same location as Sr42."

"31820284","abstracttext_key message","The specific and high-level expression of 1Ax1 is determined by different promoter regions. HMW-GS synthesis occurs in aleurone layer cells. Heterologous proteins can be stored in protein bodies. High-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) is highly expressed in the endosperm of wheat and relative species, where their expression level and allelic variation affect the bread-making quality and nutrient quality of flour. However, the mechanism regulating HMW-GS expression remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed the distribution of cis-acting elements in the 2659-bp promoter region of the HMW-GS gene 1Ax1, which can be divided into five element-enriched regions. Fragments derived from progressive 5' deletions were used to drive GUS gene expression in transgenic wheat, which was confirmed in aleurone layer cells, inner starchy endosperm cells, starchy endosperm transfer cells, and aleurone transfer cells by histochemical staining. The promoter region ranging from - 297 to - 1 was responsible for tissue-specific expression, while fragments from - 1724 to - 618 and from - 618 to - 297 were responsible for high-level expression. Under the control of the 1Ax1 promoter, heterologous protein could be stored in the form of protein bodies in inner starchy endosperm cells, even without a special location signal. Our findings not only deepen our understanding of glutenin expression regulation, trafficking, and accumulation but also provide a strategy for the utilization of wheat endosperm as a bioreactor for the production of nutrients and metabolic products."

"31813413","abstracttext","In this study we analysed the expression patterns of TaLr35PR2 and confirmed its role in Lr35-mediated adult resistance to leaf rust fungus. β-1,3-glucanase, a pathogenesis-related protein, has a critical function in plant defence response against fungal pathogens. We previously described the full-length gene TaLr35PR2, which encodes a protein exhibiting amino acid and structural similarity to β-1,3-glucanase, in the wheat near-isogenic line TcLr35 (GenBank accession number DQ294235.1). This work aimed to further assess TaLr35PR2 expression patterns and function in Lr35-mediated adult resistance to Puccinia triticina. Immunoblot was performed to demonstrate that TaLr35PR2 expression was triggered early by P. triticina, with expression levels markedly elevated in incompatible interaction compared with those in compatible one. Additionally, TaLr35PR2 accumulation steadily increased and overtly peaked after challenge with P. triticina through the various developmental stages of TcLr35 wheat, and remaining at similar levels after mock inoculation. Furthermore, TaLr35PR2 expression was significantly reduced in barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV)-induced gene knockdown plants, in which pathological assessment revealed that TaLr35PR2-silenced plants was obviously susceptible to leaf rust fungus compared with wild-type TcLr35, indicating that Lr35-mediated resistance to leaf rust was diminished. These findings strongly suggest that TaLr35PR2 is involved in Lr35-mediated wheat defence against the leaf rust pathogen."
"31702117","articletitle","The transcription factor Zt107320 affects the dimorphic switch, growth and virulence of the fungal wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici."
"31702117","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici is a filamentous fungus causing Septoria tritici blotch in wheat. The pathogen has a narrow host range and infections of grasses other than susceptible wheat are blocked early after stomatal penetration. During these abortive infections, the fungus shows a markedly different gene expression pattern. However, the underlying mechanisms causing differential gene expression during host and non-host interactions are largely unknown, but likely include transcriptional regulators responsible for the onset of an infection programme in compatible hosts. MoCOD1, a member of the fungal Zn(II) 2 Cys 6 transcription factor family, has been shown to directly affect pathogenicity in the rice blast pathogen Magnaporthe oryzae. Here, we analyse the role of the putative transcription factor Zt107320, a homologue of MoCOD1, during infection of compatible and incompatible hosts by Z. tritici. We show for the first time that Zt107320 is differentially expressed in host versus non-host infections and that lower expression corresponds to an incompatible infection of non-hosts. Applying reverse genetics approaches, we further show that Zt107320 regulates the dimorphic switch as well as the growth rate of Z. tritici and affects fungal cell wall composition in vitro. Moreover, ∆Zt107320 mutants showed reduced virulence during compatible infections of wheat. We conclude that Zt107320 directly influences pathogen fitness and propose that Zt107320 is involved in the regulation of growth processes and pathogenicity during infection."

In the present study, we tested changes in expression of wheat genes (B2H2, ICS, PAL, and PR2) involved in defence against diseases. We first compared expression of the analysed genes in seedlings of non-inoculated and artificially inoculated wheat (variety Bohemia). The second part of the experiment compared expression of these genes in seedlings grown under various treatment conditions. These treatments were chosen to determine the effects of prochloraz, sodium bicarbonate, ergosterol, aescin and potassium iodide on expression of the analysed defence genes. In addition to the inoculated and non-inoculated cultivar Bohemia, we additionally examined two other varieties of wheat with contrasting resistance to Fusarium sp. infection. These were the blue aleurone layer variety Scorpion that is susceptible to Fusarium sp. infection and variety V2-49-17 with yellow endosperm and partial resistance to Fusarium sp. infection. In this manner, we were able to compare potential effects of inductors upon defence gene expression among three varieties with different susceptibility to infection but also between inoculated and non-inoculated seedlings of a single variety. The lowest infection levels were detected in the sodium bicarbonate treatment. Sodium bicarbonate had not only negative influence on Fusarium growth but also positively affected expression of plant defence genes. Expression of the four marker genes shown to be important in plant defence was significantly affected by the treatments. The greatest upregulation in comparison to the water control was identified under all treatments for the B2H2 gene. Only expression of PAL under the ergosterol and prochloraz treatments were not statistically significant."

"31552072","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a plant pathogenic fungus which is able to infect wheat and other economically important cereal crop species. The role of ethylene in the interaction with host plants is unclear and controversial. We have analyzed the inventory of genes with a putative function in ethylene production or degradation of the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane carboxylic acid (ACC). F. graminearum , in contrast to other species, does not contain a candidate gene encoding ethylene-forming enzyme. Three genes with similarity to ACC synthases exist; heterologous expression of these did not reveal enzymatic activity. The F. graminearum genome contains in addition two ACC deaminase candidate genes. We have expressed both genes in E. coli and characterized the enzymatic properties of the affinity-purified products. One of the proteins had indeed ACC deaminase activity, with kinetic properties similar to ethylene-stress reducing enzymes of plant growth promoting bacteria. The other candidate was inactive with ACC but turned out to be a d-cysteine desulfhydrase. Since it had been reported that ethylene insensitivity in transgenic wheat increased Fusarium resistance and reduced the content of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in infected wheat, we generated single and double knockout mutants of both genes in the F. graminearum strain PH-1. No statistically significant effect of the gene disruptions on fungal spread or mycotoxin content was detected, indicating that the ability of the fungus to manipulate the production of the gaseous plant hormones ethylene and H 2 S is dispensable for full virulence."

"31326557","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is a devastating disease worldwide that is predominantly caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum. The aim of this work was to study differentially abundant protein species of near-isogenic lines A061-3 and A061-4 with the final goal of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of their differential resistance to F. graminearum. The objectives were accomplished using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) with mass spectrometry (MS). Lines A061-3 and A061-4 were resistant and susceptible to F. graminearum, respectively. At four post-inoculation points, 11,070 protein species were identified, of which 762 were differentially abundant. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis showed that most differentially abundant protein species participated in 18 biological processes after inoculation. Further analysis demonstrated that crucial metabolic pathways like plant-pathogen interaction had increased abundance. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed increased gene products of eight selected genes in plant-pathogen interaction. This investigation provides a basic bioinformatics-based characterization of differentially abundant protein species during early stages against F. graminearum. SIGNIFICANCE: FHB leads to severe yield loss and reduction in grain quality in wheat and other small grain cereals. Although extensive studies have focused on wheat resistance against F. graminearum, the molecular mechanism of FHB resistance in wheat remains to be further elucidated. In the present study, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis indicated that ten pathways were putatively associated with FHB resistance. Principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) showed that a valuable set of differentially abundant protein species including pathogenesis-related protein species were identified for further discovery of candidate genes for FHB resistance. This investigation provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms associated with FHB resistance and as well as a foundation for future studies."

The microbiological contaminants of wheat grains and the efficacy of Atmospheric Cold Plasma (ACP) for potential to control these risks were investigated. The evaluations were performed using a contained reactor dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) system; samples were treated for 0-20 min using direct and indirect plasma exposure. Amplicon-based metagenomic analysis using bacterial 16S rRNA gene and fungal 18S rRNA gene with internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region was performed to characterize the change in microbial community composition in response to ACP treatment. The antimicrobial efficacy of ACP against a range of bacterial and fungal contaminants of wheat, was assessed to include individual isolates from grains as challenge pathogens. ACP influenced wheat microbiome composition, with a higher microbial diversity as well as abundance found on the untreated control grain samples. Culture and genomic approaches revealed different trends for mycoflora detection and control. A challenge study demonstrated that using direct mode of plasma exposure with 20 min of treatment significantly reduced the concentration of all pathogens. Overall, reduction levels for B. atrophaeus vegetative cells were higher than for all fungal species tested, whereas B. atrophaeus spores were the most resistant to ACP among all microorganisms tested. Of note, repeating sub-lethal plasma treatment did not induce resistance to ACP in either B. atrophaeus or A. flavus spores. ACP process control could be tailored to address diverse microbiological risks for grain stability and safety."

"32954989","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccininia triticina (Pt), is one of the most common wheat diseases in the Great Plains of the USA. A population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from CI 17884 x Bainong 418 was evaluated for responses to leaf rust race Pt52-2 and genotyped using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis identified a minor gene for resistance to leaf rust, designated QLr.stars-1RS, on the 1BL.1RS translocation segment in Bainong 418, and another leaf rust resistance gene, Lr47, on chromosome 7A of CI 17884. Lr47, originally identified in CI 17884 and located in a wheat-T. speltoides translocation segment 7S#1S, remains one of only a few race-specific resistance genes still effective in the Great Plains. A set of 7A-specific simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were developed and used to genotype CI 17884 and a pair of near-isogenic lines differing in the presence or absence of 7S#1S, PI 603918 and Pavon F76. Haplotype analysis indicated that the estimated length of 7S#1S was 157.23 to 174.42 Mb, accounting for about 23% of the 7A chromosome. Two SNPs on 7S#1S and 4 SNPs on the 1RS chromosome arm were converted to KASP markers, which were subsequently validated in a panel of cultivars and recently released elite breeding lines. Of these, one and two KASP markers are specific to the 1RS chromosome arm and 7S#1S, respectively, indicating that they can facilitate the introgression of Lr47 and QLr.stars-1BS into locally adapted wheat cultivars and breeding lines."
"33047233","articletitle","Elevated CO 2 alters tissue balance of nitrogen metabolism and downregulates nitrogen assimilation and signalling gene expression in wheat seedlings receiving high nitrate supply."
"33047233","abstracttext","Tissue and canopy-level evidence suggests that elevated carbon dioxide (EC) inhibits shoot nitrate assimilation in plants and thereby affects nitrogen (N) and protein content of the economic produce. It is speculated that species or genotypes relying more on root nitrate assimilation can adapt better under EC due to the improved/steady supply of reductants required for nitrate assimilation. A study was conducted to examine the effect of EC on N assimilation and associated gene expression in wheat seedlings. Wheat genotypes, BT-Schomburgk (BTS) with comparatively high leaf nitrate reductase (NR) activity and Gluyas Early (GE) with high root NR activity were grown in hydroponic culture for 30 days with two different nitrate levels (0.05 mM and 5 mM) in the climate controlled growth chambers maintained at either ambient (400 ± 10 μmol mol -1 ) or EC (700 ± 10 μmol mol -1 ) conditions. Exposure to EC downregulated the activity of enzyme NR and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) in leaf tissues, whereas in roots, activities of both the enzymes were upregulated by exposure to EC. In addition, EC downregulated N assimilation and signalling gene expression under high N availability. Root N assimilation was less affected in comparison with shoot N assimilation; thereby, the proportion of root contribution towards total assimilation was higher. The results suggest that EC could alter and re-programme N assimilation and signalling in wheat seedlings. The genotype and tissue-specific effects of EC on N assimilation also warrants the need for identification of suitable genotypes and revision of fertiliser regime for tapping the beneficial effects of EC conditions."

A total of 17 stable QTLs related to kernel traits were identified, notably, two stable QTLs QTkw.cas-1A.2 and QTkw.cas-4A explained the largest portion of the phenotypic variance for TKW and kernel length (KL), and the other two stable QTLs QTkw.cas-6A.1 and QTkw.cas-7D.2 contributed more effects on kernel width (KW). Conditional QTL analysis revealed that the stable QTLs for TKW were mainly affected by KW. The QTLs QTkw.cas-7D.2 and QKw.cas-7D.1 associated with TKW and KW were delimited to the physical interval of approximately 3.82 Mb harboring 47 candidate genes. Among them, the candidate gene TaFT-D1 had a 1 bp insertions/deletion (InDel) within the third exon, which might be the reason for diversity in TKW and KW between the two parents. A Kompetitive Allele-Specific PCR (KASP) marker of TaFT-D1 allele was developed and verified by PG-RIL and a natural population consisted of 141 cultivar/lines.

"2000092","abstracttext","To identify cis-regulatory elements of the gliadin gene, a study of the gliadin gene promoter was conducted by transient expression analysis of plasmid DNAs which were introduced into plant protoplasts by electroporation. The promoter region (-592 bp to +18 bp from the translational start) of this developmentally regulated gene, when fused upstream to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter cassette was unable to direct significant CAT expression in wheat or tobacco suspension cells. Because this monocot gene promoter appeared to be under stringent tissue-specific control, a hybrid promoter approach using a nopaline synthase (nos) promoter was employed. A series of 3' deletions of the gliadin promoter were placed upstream of either a nonfunctional -101 nos or a nearly wild-type -155 nos promoter fused in turn to a CAT reporter gene cassette. Transient expression analysis of these plasmid DNAs in tobacco cells showed that the gliadin fragment could either restore the activity of the non-functional nos promoter (series I) or enhance the activity of the functional nos promoter (series II). The degree of restoration of the promoter function conferred by gliadin fragments of the first series was proportional to the enhancing effect of the same fragments in the second series of constructs. The transcriptional activity of the gliadin (-592 bp to -77 bp) -nos hybrid promoter was reduced by 26% upon 3' deletion of sequences in the region -141 bp to -77 bp, which contains both the TATA and CCAAT boxes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"8129619","articletitle","Analysis of a translational enhancer upstream from the coat protein open reading frame of potato virus S."
"8129619","abstracttext","Evidence has suggested that the subgenomic RNA of the carlavirus potato virus S is an efficient message for the coat protein, even though evidence suggests it is uncapped at its 5' terminus. We have investigated the effect of the upstream region of the coat protein gene of potato virus S on the level of reporter gene expression in vitro. The region of 101 nucleotides upstream of the coat protein, designated VTE (viral translational enhancer) was found to increase levels of translation in comparison to a synthetic leader when linked to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte and wheat germ lysate. VTE was also able to increase translation of the reporter gene luciferase (LUC) in vitro above the levels obtained for both a synthetic leader and a leader obtained from a plant gene isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana. The level of enhancement was evident with both capped and uncapped transcripts. When the VTE sequence was deleted to 20 nucleotides of the upstream region, thus removing the nucleotide block homologous among carlaviruses, the ability to enhance levels of translation was removed. In vitro translation studies indicated that the translational enhancement activity of VTE was at least partially cap independent. Translation of VTE linked to reporter genes in the presence of cap analogue was relatively unaffected whereas synthetic leader and a plant leader constructs were both more sensitive. In vitro competition analysis revealed that when short RNA transcripts representing the 101 nucleotides of VTE were added in trans to functional VTE leader LUC constructs there was a marked decrease in the level of translation when compared with a synthetic leader added in trans. These results suggest that the upstream region of the coat protein ORF of potato virus S promotes translation in a cap-independent manner that may involve the binding of proteins and/or ribosomes to the 101 nucleotides of the VTE sequence."

"8848127","abstracttext","The structures in the mammary gland involved in milk ejection have been investigated with regard to their relation to different types of peptidergic nerve fibres and their origin. Lactating rats were studied with immunohistochemistry focusing on the nipple, the parenchyma, the mammary blood vessels and the mammary nerve. The human mammary gland was also analysed. In the mammary gland from rat and human, nerve endings in the subepidermis, around smooth muscle cells in the nipple, in the connective tissue surrounding lactiferous ducts and alveoli in the nipple and in the parenchyma of the mammary gland showed immunoreactivity for calcitonin gene-related peptide, substance P, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, peptide histidine isoleucine, neuropeptide Y, galanin and tyrosine hydroxylase, whereas dynorphin-positive nerve fibres could not be detected. The mammary nerve contained calcitonin gene-related peptide, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, neuropeptide Y and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivities; the adventitia of the mammary artery contained nerve fibres immunoreactive for neuropeptide Y and tyrosine hydroxylase, while vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-, peptide histidine isoleucine-, calcitonin gene-related peptide- and substance P-positive fibres were found in the tissue surrounding the artery. The wall of the mammary vein had nerve terminals immunoreactive for neuropeptide Y, tyrosine hydroxylase, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P. With the help of retrograde tracing using wheat germ agglutinin in combination with immunohistochemistry, projections of calcitonin gene-related peptide-immunoreactive cells in the dorsal root ganglia to the nipple were established. Neurons in the sympathetic stellate ganglion containing neuropeptide Y and tyrosine hydroxylase also projected to the mammary gland. Moreover retrogradely-labelled cells were found in the nodose ganglion, and they were vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-immunoreactive. These results demonstrate a rich distribution of different types of nerve fibres in structures of the mammary gland related to milk ejection. These nerve fibres and their peptides may be involved in the local control of milk ejection."

"8108498","abstracttext","The EMB-1 mRNA of carrot (Daucus carota) was isolated as an embryo abundant cDNA clone (T.H. Ulrich, E.S. Wurtele, B.J. Nikolau [1990] Nucleic Acids Res 18: 2826). Northern analyses of RNA isolated from embryos, cultured cells, and a variety of vegetative organs indicate that the EMB-1 mRNA specifically accumulates in embryos, beginning at the early stages of embryo development. In situ hybridization with both zygotic and somatic embryos show that the EMB-1 mRNA begins to accumulate at low levels throughout globular embryos. Accumulation of EMB-1 mRNA increases and becomes more localized as embryos mature; in torpedo embryos, EMB-1 mRNA preferentially accumulates in the meristematic regions, particularly the procambium. The similarity in distribution of EMB-1 mRNA in both zygotic and somatic embryos indicates that much of the spatial pattern of expression of the emb-1 gene is dependent on the developmental program of the carrot embryo and does not require maternal or endosperm factors. The EMB-1 protein (relative molecular weight 9910) is a very hydrophilic protein that is a member of a class of highly conserved proteins (typified also by the Em protein of wheat and the Lea D19 protein of cotton) that may be ubiquitous among angiosperm embryos but whose functions are as yet unknown. The carrot genome appears to contain one or two copies of the emb-1 gene. A 1313-base pair DNA fragment of the carrot genome containing the emb-1 gene was isolated and sequenced. The gene is interrupted by a single intron of 99 base pairs. Primer extension experiments identify two EMB-1 mRNAs, differing by 6 bases at their 5' ends that are transcribed from this gene."
"9450342","articletitle","Splicing features in maize streak virus virion- and complementary-sense gene expression."
"9450342","abstracttext","The single-stranded DNA geminiviruses produce transcripts from both strands (virion- and complementary-sense) of a nuclear double-stranded DNA molecule. In maize streak virus (MSV)-infected maize plants, approximately 80% of the complementary-sense transcripts produce the C1 protein, whilst the remaining 20% are spliced to remove a 92 nt intron and produce a C1:C2 fusion protein (Rep). Disruption of the complementary-sense 3' splice site abolished virus replication. The majority of the virion-sense transcripts initiated one nucleotide upstream of the V1 (movement protein) gene and a minority a further 141 nucleotides upstream. A 76 nt intron, with features typical of plant introns, was identified within the V1 gene, upstream of the coat protein gene. Spliced and unspliced forms of each virion-sense transcript were produced, but they differed in splicing efficiency. Approximately 50% of the major transcript and less than 10% of the minor transcript were processed. Mutagenesis of the consensus 5' splice site in the V1 gene resulted in the use of alternative cryptic splice sites, confirming the importance of splicing for MSV infection. Spliced virion-sense transcripts were also identified in tissue infected with the closely-related Digitaria streak virus (DSV) but not with another subgroup I geminivirus, wheat dwarf virus. Collectively, the multiple transcript initiation sites and different splicing efficiencies suggest that splicing is an important feature in the regulation of both early and late gene expression in MSV and DSV."

"16188032","abstracttext_background","Rice is an important staple food and, with the smallest cereal genome, serves as a reference species for studies on the evolution of cereals and other grasses. Therefore, decoding its entire genome will be a prerequisite for applied and basic research on this species and all other cereals."
"16188032","abstracttext_results","We have determined and analyzed the complete sequences of two of its chromosomes, 11 and 12, which total 55.9 Mb (14.3% of the entire genome length), based on a set of overlapping clones. A total of 5,993 non-transposable element related genes are present on these chromosomes. Among them are 289 disease resistance-like and 28 defense-response genes, a higher proportion of these categories than on any other rice chromosome. A three-Mb segment on both chromosomes resulted from a duplication 7.7 million years ago (mya), the most recent large-scale duplication in the rice genome. Paralogous gene copies within this segmental duplication can be aligned with genomic assemblies from sorghum and maize. Although these gene copies are preserved on both chromosomes, their expression patterns have diverged. When the gene order of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 was compared to wheat gene loci, significant synteny between these orthologous regions was detected, illustrating the presence of conserved genes alternating with recently evolved genes."
"16188032","abstracttext_conclusion","Because the resistance and defense response genes, enriched on these chromosomes relative to the whole genome, also occur in clusters, they provide a preferred target for breeding durable disease resistance in rice and the isolation of their allelic variants. The recent duplication of a large chromosomal segment coupled with the high density of disease resistance gene clusters makes this the most recently evolved part of the rice genome. Based on syntenic alignments of these chromosomes, rice chromosome 11 and 12 do not appear to have resulted from a single whole-genome duplication event as previously suggested."

"16887895","abstracttext","To clarify the molecular mechanism that regulates iron (Fe) acquisition in graminaceous plants, a time-course analysis of gene expression during Fe deficiency stress was conducted using a rice 22K oligo-DNA microarray. Twenty-one genes for proteins that function in gene regulation were induced by Fe deficiency. Of these genes, a putative basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor gene, named OsIRO2, was strongly expressed in both roots and shoots during Fe deficiency stress. The expression of OsIRO2 was induced exclusively by Fe deficiency, and not by deficiencies in other metals. Expression of the barley HvIRO2 gene, which is a homologue of OsIRO2, was also induced by Fe deficiency. An in silico search revealed that IRO2 is highly conserved among graminaceous plants, which include wheat, sorghum, and maize. The cyclic amplification and selection of targets (CASTing) technique revealed that OsIRO2 bound preferentially to the sequence 5'-ACCACGTGGTTTT-3', and the electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed 5'-CACGTGG-3' as the core sequence for OsIRO2 binding. Sequences similar to the OsIRO2-binding sequence were found upstream of several genes that are involved in Fe acquisition, such as OsNAS1, OsNAS3, OsIRT1, OsFDH, OsAPT1, and IDS3. The core sequence of the OsIRO2-binding sequence occurred more frequently in the upstream regions of Fe deficiency-inducible genes than in the corresponding regions of non-inducible genes. These results suggest that IRO2 is involved in the regulation of gene expression under Fe-deficient conditions."

"17114933","abstracttext","Expanded CUG repeats in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the gene encoding myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) cause myotonic dystrophy type 1 disease (DM1). The presence of such repeats has been found to impede gene expression at several levels in model systems. We took a bioinformatic approach to survey all human mRNA sequences for polymorphic CUG repeats. Our survey revealed that CUG repeats occur widely in various regions of mRNAs, with higher frequency in protein coding regions than 5'-UTRs or 3'-UTRs. About 30 genes were found to contain CUG repeats that are polymorphic in the number of repeats, suggesting the potential to expand or shrink. However, long polymorphic repeats were restricted to the 3'-UTR of the DMPK gene and the coding region of the ribosomal protein L14 gene. Using cell-free translation systems, we showed that extended CUG repeats can inhibit protein synthesis in vitro in the rabbit reticulocyte lysate, but not in wheat germ extracts, consistent with our previous finding of an interaction of CUG repeats with the protein kinase PKR. In transfected cells, CUG repeats can inhibit gene expression both in cis and in trans. However, observations with PKR-minus cells indicate that these effects are not primarily attributable to the interaction of extended CUG repeats with PKR. Northwestern blotting detected the presence in human cells of more CUG-binding proteins than are currently known."

"16896713","abstracttext","A leaf rust resistance gene Lr19 on the chromosome 7DL of wheat derived from Agropyron elongatum was tagged with random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and microsatellite markers. The F(2) population of 340 plants derived from a cross between the leaf rust resistant near-isogenic line (NIL) of Thatcher (Tc + Lr19) and leaf rust susceptible line Agra Local that segregated for dominant monogenic leaf rust resistance was utilized for generating the mapping population. The molecular markers were mapped in the F(2) derived F(3) homozygous population of 140 seedlings. Sixteen RAPD markers were identified as linked to the alien gene Lr19 among which eight were in a coupling phase linkage. Twelve RAPD markers co-segregated with Lr19 locus. Nine microsatellite markers located on the long arm of chromosome 7D were also mapped as linked to the gene Lr19, including 7 markers which co-segregated with Lr19 locus, thus generating a saturated region carrying 25 molecular markers linked to the gene Lr19 within 10.2 +/- 0.062 cM on either side of the locus. Two RAPD markers S265(512) and S253(737) which flanked the locus Lr19 were converted to sequence characterized amplified region markers SCS265(512) and SCS253(736), respectively. The marker SCS265(512) was linked with Lr19 in a coupling phase and the marker SCS253(736) was linked in a repulsion phase, which when used together mimicked one co-dominant marker capable of distinguishing the heterozygous resistant seedlings from the homozygous resistant. The molecular markers were validated on NILs mostly in Thatcher background isogenic for 44 different Lr genes belonging to both native and alien origin. The validation for polymorphism in common leaf rust susceptible cultivars also confirmed the utility of these tightly linked markers to the gene Lr19 in marker-assisted selection."
"18257678","articletitle","Recent fungal diseases of crop plants: is lateral gene transfer a common theme?"
"18257678","abstracttext","A cursory glance at old textbooks of plant pathology reveals that the diseases which are the current scourge of agriculture in many parts of the world are a different set from those that were prominent 50 or 100 years ago. Why have these new diseases arisen? The traditional explanations subscribe to the ""nature abhors a vacuum"" principle-that control of one disease creates the condition for the emergence of a replacement-but does little to explain why the new pathogen succeeds. The emergence of a new disease requires a series of conditions and steps, including the enhanced fecundity of the new pathogen, enhanced survival from season to season, and spread around the world. Recently, evidence was obtained that wheat tan spot emerged through a lateral gene transfer event some time prior to 1941. Although there have been sporadic and persistent reports of lateral gene transfer between and into fungal plant pathogens, most examples have been dismissed through incomplete evidence. The completion of whole genome sequences of an increasing number of fungal pathogens no longer allows such proposed cases of lateral gene transfer to be dismissed so easily. How frequent are lateral gene transfers involving fungal plant pathogens, and can this process explain the emergence of many of the new diseases of the recent past? Many of the apparently new diseases are dependant on the expression of host-specific toxins. These are enigmatic molecules whose action requires the presence of plant genes with products that specifically encode sensitivity to the toxin and susceptibility to the disease. It is also notable that many new diseases belong to the fungal taxon dothideomycetes. This review explores the coincidence of new diseases, interspecific gene transfer, host-specific toxins, and the dothideomycete class."

"18031866","abstracttext","Piriformospora indica is a fungus of the order Sebacinales (Basidiomycota) infesting roots of mono- and dicotyledonous plants. Endophytic fungal colonization leads to enhanced plant growth while host cell death is required for proliferation in differentiated root tissue to form a mutualistic interaction. Colonization of barley roots by P. indica and related Sebacina vermifera strains also leads to systemic resistance against the leaf pathogenic fungus Blumeria graminis f.sp. hordei due to a yet unknown mechanism of induced resistance. In order to elucidate plant response pathways governed by these root endophytes, we analyzed gene expression in barley plants exhibiting an established symbiosis with P. indica 3 weeks after inoculation. P. indica-colonized roots showed no induction of defence-related genes, while other genes showed a differential regulation pattern indicating a faster P. indica-dependent root development. Gene expression analysis of leaves detected only few systemically induced mRNAs. Among differentially regulated transcripts, we characterized the pathogenesis-related gene HvPr17b and the molecular chaperone HvHsp70 in more detail. HvPr17b shows similarity with TaWCI5, a wheat gene inducible by chemical resistance inducers and salicylate, and was previously proven to exhibit antifungal activity against B. graminis. HvHsp70 is the first gene found to systemically indicate root colonization with endophytic fungi of the order Sebacinales. Both genes are discussed as markers for endophytic colonization and resulting systemic responses."

"18253945","abstracttext","Chronic mechanical compression of the spinal cord causes neural tissue damage, including loss of anterior horn cells around the level of injury. Exogenous delivery of neurotrophins to neuronal cells could provide neuroprotection to a spinal cord subjected to mechanical injury. We investigated the efficacy of retrograde gene delivery of adenoviral vector (AdV) carrying neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) gene into twy (twy/twy) mouse spinal cord anterior horn neurons with chronic and progressive mechanical compression at C1-C2 level. AdV-NT-3 was used for retrograde delivery via the sternomastoid muscle to the cervical spinal accessory motoneurons in 16-week-old adult twy mice with relatively mild spinal cord compression. Four weeks after the AdV-NT-3 or AdV-beta-galactosidase cDNA (LacZ) as a marker gene injection, the compressed cervical spinal cord was examined histologically, immunohistologically, and by immunoblot analysis. Immunoreactivity to NT-3 was significantly enhanced in the AdV-NT-3-injected twy mice compared with the AdV-LacZ-injected mice. The numbers of anterior horn neurons of Nissl-, choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-, and trkC-stained and wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)-labeled neurons at the spinal cord level with maximum compression were significantly higher in AdV-NT-3-transfected than in AdV-LacZ-transfected twy mice. Retrograde NT-3 gene transfer to twy mouse anterior horn neurons increased neurite axonal length and arborization of WGA-HRP-labeled neurons. Our results suggest that targeted retrograde NT-3 gene delivery is feasible in the intact animal and that it enhances neuronal survival even under chronic mechanical compression of the spinal cord."
"20078770","articletitle","Polyploidy and DNA methylation: new tools available."
"20078770","abstracttext","Most plant species are recent or ancient polyploids (displaying at least one round of genome duplication in their history). Cultivated species (e.g. wheat, cotton, canola, sugarcane, coffee) and invasive species are often relatively recent polyploids, and frequently of hybrid origin (i.e. allopolyploids). Despite the genetic bottleneck occurring during the allopolyploid speciation process, the formation of such species from two divergent lineages leads to fixed heterozygosity decisive to their success. New phenotypes and new niche occupation are usually associated with this mode of speciation, as a result of both genomic rearrangements and gene expression changes of different magnitudes depending on the different polyploid species investigated. These gene expression changes affecting newly formed polyploid species may result from various, interconnected mechanisms, including (i) functional interactions between the homoeologous copies and between their products, that are reunited in the same nucleus and cell; (ii) the fate of duplicated copies, selective pressure on one of the parental copy being released which could lead to gene loss, pseudogenization, or alternatively, to subfunctionalization or neofunctionalization; and (iii) epigenetic landscape changes that in turn affect gene expression. As one of the interrelated processes leading to epigenetic regulation of gene expression, the DNA methylation status of newly formed species appears to be consistently affected following both hybridization and genome doubling. In this issue, Verhoeven et al. have investigated the fate of DNA methylation patterns that could affect naturally occurring new asexual triploid lineages of dandelions. As a result of such a ploidy level change, the authors demonstrate stably transmitted DNA methylation changes leading to unique DNA methylation patterns in each newly formed lineage. Most studies published to date on plant DNA methylation polymorphism were performed using restriction enzymes sensitive to methylation. Recently, new high-throughput methods were made available, thanks to the development of 'next-generation sequencing' techniques. The combination of these methods offers powerful and promising tools to investigate epigenetic variation in both model and non-model systems."

Of particular interest are the storage protein genes, globulin-1, globulin-2 and an unidentified cupin family gene.

"23357245","abstracttext","The plant-associated Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum strain B9601-Y2, isolated from wheat rhizosphere, is a powerful plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium. Its relative large genome size of 4.24Mbp, exceeding that of other representatives of the B. amyloliquefaciens subsp. plantarum taxon, is mainly due to the presence of 18 DNA-islands containing remnants of phages, a unique restriction modification system, a gene cluster for mersacidin synthesis, and an orphan gene cluster devoted to non-ribosomal synthesis of an unidentified peptide. Like other members of the taxon, the Y2 genome contains giant gene clusters for non-ribosomal synthesis of the polyketides macrolactin, difficidin, and bacillaene, the antifungal lipopeptides bacillomycin D, and fengycin, the siderophore bacillibactin, and the dipeptide bacilysin. A gene cluster encoding enzymes for a degradative pathway with 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate and 2-keto-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate as intermediates was explored by genome mining and found as being a unique feature for representatives of the plantarum subspecies. A survey of the Y2 genome against other B. amyloliquefaciens genomes revealed 130 genes only occurring in subsp. plantarum but not in subsp. amyloliquefaciens. Notably, the surfactin gene cluster is not functional due to a large deletion removing parts of the Srf synthetases B and C. Expression of polyketides, lipopeptides, mersacidin, and of the growth hormone indole-3-acetic acid in Y2 was demonstrated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectroscopy and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively."
"23715938","articletitle","Radiation hybrid QTL mapping of Tdes2 involved in the first meiotic division of wheat."
"23715938","abstracttext","Since the dawn of wheat cytogenetics, chromosome 3B has been known to harbor a gene(s) that, when removed, causes chromosome desynapsis and gametic sterility. The lack of natural genetic diversity for this gene(s) has prevented any attempt to fine map and further characterize it. Here, gamma radiation treatment was used to create artificial diversity for this locus. A total of 696 radiation hybrid lines were genotyped with a custom mini array of 140 DArT markers, selected to evenly span the whole 3B chromosome. The resulting map spanned 2,852 centi Ray with a calculated resolution of 0.384 Mb. Phenotyping for the occurrence of meiotic desynapsis was conducted by measuring the level of gametic sterility as seeds produced per spikelet and pollen viability at booting. Composite interval mapping revealed a single QTL with LOD of 16.2 and r (2) of 25.6 % between markers wmc326 and wPt-8983 on the long arm of chromosome 3B. By independent analysis, the location of the QTL was confirmed to be within the deletion bin 3BL7-0.63-1.00 and to correspond to a single gene located ~1.4 Mb away from wPt-8983. The meiotic behavior of lines lacking this gene was characterized cytogenetically to reveal striking similarities with mutants for the dy locus, located on the syntenic chromosome 3 of maize. This represents the first example to date of employing radiation hybrids for QTL analysis. The success achieved by this approach provides an ideal starting point for the final cloning of this interesting gene involved in meiosis of cereals."
"24162482","articletitle","Dosage effects of the three Wx genes on amylose synthesis in wheat endosperm."
"24162482","abstracttext","Amylose synthesis in wheat endosperm is mainly controlled by the granule-bound starch synthase of about 60 kDa, the so-called waxy (Wx) protein. The Wx proteins are the product of the Wx genes at a triplicate set of single-copy homoeoloci located on chromosomes 7A (Wx-A1), 4A (Wx-B1) and 7D (Wx-D1). Using 'Chinese Spring' and its aneuploid lines, including nullisomic-tetrasomics, tetrasomics, ditelosomics and deletion stocks, together with single-chromosome substitution lines for these chromosomes, the effects of varying the dosage of whole chromosomes and chromosome arms, as well as the effects of null alleles, upon amylose synthesis were investigated. Nullisomic 4A and the deletion of chromosome segments carrying the Wx-B1 gene reduced the amylose content by more than 3%. A reasonable agreement was found in the substitution lines. This confirms that the absence of the Wx-B1 gene, or else substitution of this gene by its null allele, has the most striking effect on decreasing amylose synthesis. The removal of chromosomes carrying either the Wx-A1 or the Wx-D1 gene reduces the amylose content by less than 2%. A similar reduction was revealed by substitution of these two genes by the null alleles. Double dosages of chromosomes 7A, 4A and 7D did not increase amylose content, while the tetrasomic chromosomes produced more of the respective Wx proteins. This suggests that a certain level of Wx gene activity or of the Wx proteins led to the maximum amount of amylose."

"26252423","abstracttext","Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) possesses a large and highly repetitive genome of 5.1 Gb that has hindered the development of a complete sequence. In 2012, the International Barley Sequencing Consortium released a resource integrating whole-genome shotgun sequences with a physical and genetic framework. However, because only 6278 bacterial artificial chromosome (BACs) in the physical map were sequenced, fine structure was limited. To gain access to the gene-containing portion of the barley genome at high resolution, we identified and sequenced 15 622 BACs representing the minimal tiling path of 72 052 physical-mapped gene-bearing BACs. This generated ~1.7 Gb of genomic sequence containing an estimated 2/3 of all Morex barley genes. Exploration of these sequenced BACs revealed that although distal ends of chromosomes contain most of the gene-enriched BACs and are characterized by high recombination rates, there are also gene-dense regions with suppressed recombination. We made use of published map-anchored sequence data from Aegilops tauschii to develop a synteny viewer between barley and the ancestor of the wheat D-genome. Except for some notable inversions, there is a high level of collinearity between the two species. The software HarvEST:Barley provides facile access to BAC sequences and their annotations, along with the barley-Ae. tauschii synteny viewer. These BAC sequences constitute a resource to improve the efficiency of marker development, map-based cloning, and comparative genomics in barley and related crops. Additional knowledge about regions of the barley genome that are gene-dense but low recombination is particularly relevant."
"25504642","articletitle","Pivoting from Arabidopsis to wheat to understand how agricultural plants integrate responses to biotic stress."
"25504642","abstracttext","In this review, we argue for a research initiative on wheat's responses to biotic stress. One goal is to begin a conversation between the disparate communities of plant pathology and entomology. Another is to understand how responses to a variety of agents of biotic stress are integrated in an important crop. We propose gene-for-gene interactions as the focus of the research initiative. On the parasite's side is an Avirulence (Avr) gene that encodes one of the many effector proteins the parasite applies to the plant to assist with colonization. On the plant's side is a Resistance (R) gene that mediates a surveillance system that detects the Avr protein directly or indirectly and triggers effector-triggered plant immunity. Even though arthropods are responsible for a significant proportion of plant biotic stress, they have not been integrated into important models of plant immunity that come from plant pathology. A roadblock has been the absence of molecular evidence for arthropod Avr effectors. Thirty years after this evidence was discovered in a plant pathogen, there is now evidence for arthropods with the cloning of the Hessian fly's vH13 Avr gene. After reviewing the two models of plant immunity, we discuss how arthropods could be incorporated. We end by showing features that make wheat an interesting system for plant immunity, including 479 resistance genes known from agriculture that target viruses, bacteria, fungi, nematodes, insects, and mites. It is not likely that humans will be subsisting on Arabidopsis in the year 2050. It is time to start understanding how agricultural plants integrate responses to biotic stress."

"26230995","abstracttext","Here we report the genetic analyses of histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) genes in the phytopathogenic fungus Magnaporthe oryzae. Eight putative M. oryzae KMT genes were targeted for gene disruption by homologous recombination. Phenotypic assays revealed that the eight KMTs were involved in various infection processes at varying degrees. Moset1 disruptants (Δmoset1) impaired in histone H3 lysine 4 methylation (H3K4me) showed the most severe defects in infection-related morphogenesis, including conidiation and appressorium formation. Consequently, Δmoset1 lost pathogenicity on wheat host plants, thus indicating that H3K4me is an important epigenetic mark for infection-related gene expression in M. oryzae. Interestingly, appressorium formation was greatly restored in the Δmoset1 mutants by exogenous addition of cAMP or of the cutin monomer, 16-hydroxypalmitic acid. The Δmoset1 mutants were still infectious on the super-susceptible barley cultivar Nigrate. These results suggested that MoSET1 plays roles in various aspects of infection, including signal perception and overcoming host-specific resistance. However, since Δmoset1 was also impaired in vegetative growth, the impact of MoSET1 on gene regulation was not infection specific. ChIP-seq analysis of H3K4 di- and tri-methylation (H3K4me2/me3) and MoSET1 protein during infection-related morphogenesis, together with RNA-seq analysis of the Δmoset1 mutant, led to the following conclusions: 1) Approximately 5% of M. oryzae genes showed significant changes in H3K4-me2 or -me3 abundance during infection-related morphogenesis. 2) In general, H3K4-me2 and -me3 abundance was positively associated with active transcription. 3) Lack of MoSET1 methyltransferase, however, resulted in up-regulation of a significant portion of the M. oryzae genes in the vegetative mycelia (1,491 genes), and during infection-related morphogenesis (1,385 genes), indicating that MoSET1 has a role in gene repression either directly or more likely indirectly. 4) Among the 4,077 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between mycelia and germination tubes, 1,201 and 882 genes were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in a Moset1-dependent manner. 5) The Moset1-dependent DEGs were enriched in several gene categories such as signal transduction, transport, RNA processing, and translation."

"26609789","abstracttext","Sunn pest, Eurygaster integriceps, is a serious pest of cereals in the wide area of the globe from Near and Middle East to East and South Europe and North Africa. This study described for the first time, identification of E. integriceps trypsin serine protease and cathepsin-L cysteine, transcripts involved in digestion, which might serve as targets for pest control management. A total of 478 and 500 base pair long putative trypsin and cysteine gene sequences were characterized and named Tryp and Cys, respectively. In addition, the tissue-specific relative gene expression levels of these genes as well as gluten hydrolase (Gl) were determined under different host kernels feeding conditions. Result showed that mRNA expression of Cys, Tryp, and Gl was significantly affected after feeding on various host plant species. Transcript levels of these genes were most abundant in the wheat-fed E. integriceps larvae compared to other hosts. The Cys transcript was detected exclusively in the gut, whereas the Gl and Tryp transcripts were detectable in both salivary glands and gut. Also possibility of Sunn pest gene silencing was studied by topical application of cysteine double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The results indicated that topically applied dsRNA on fifth nymphal stage can penetrate the cuticle of the insect and induce RNA interference. The Cys gene mRNA transcript in the gut was reduced to 83.8% 2 days posttreatment. Also, it was found that dsRNA of Cys gene affected fifth nymphal stage development suggesting the involvement of this protease in the insect growth, development, and molting."

"27787603","abstracttext_main conclusion","In this report, we demonstrate that Brachypodium distachyon could serve as a relatively high throughput in planta functional assay system for Triticeae anther-specific gene promoters. There remains a vast gap in our knowledge of the promoter cis-acting elements responsible for the transcriptional regulation of Triticeae anther-specific genes. In an attempt to identify conserved cis-elements, 14 pollen-specific and 8 tapetum-specific Triticeae putative promoter sequences were analyzed using different promoter sequence analysis tools. Several cis-elements were found to be enriched in these sequences and their possible role in gene expression regulation in the anther is discussed. Despite the fact that potential cis-acting elements can be identified within putative promoter sequence datasets, determining whether particular promoter sequences can in fact direct proper tissue-specific and developmental gene expression still needs to be confirmed via functional assays preferably performed in closely related plants. Transgenic functional assays with Triticeae species remain challenging and Brachypodium distachyon may represent a suitable alternative. The promoters of the triticale pollen-specific genes group 3 pollen allergen (PAL3) and group 4 pollen allergen (PAL4), as well as the tapetum-specific genes chalcone synthase-like 1 (CHSL1), from wheat and cysteine-rich protein 1 (CRP1) from triticale were fused to the green fluorescent protein gene (GFP) and analyzed in transgenic Brachypodium. This report demonstrates that this model species could serve to accelerate the functional analysis of Triticeae anther-specific gene promoters."

With more crop genomes emerging all the time, we are nearer having the basic information, at the gene-level, to begin assembling crop gene catalogues and using data from other plant species to understand how the genes function and how their interactions govern crop development and physiology. Unfortunately, the task of creating such a complete knowledge base of gene functions, interaction networks and trait biology is technically challenging because the relevant data are dispersed in myriad databases in a variety of data formats with variable quality and coverage. In this paper we present a general approach for building genome-scale knowledge networks that provide a unified representation of heterogeneous but interconnected datasets to enable effective knowledge mining and gene discovery. We describe the datasets and outline the methods, workflows and tools that we have developed for creating and visualising these networks for the major crop species, wheat and barley. We present the global characteristics of such knowledge networks and with an example linking a seed size phenotype to a barley WRKY transcription factor orthologous to TTG2 from Arabidopsis, we illustrate the value of integrated data in biological knowledge discovery. The software we have developed (www.ondex.org) and the knowledge resources (http://knetminer.rothamsted.ac.uk) we have created are all open-source and provide a first step towards systematic and evidence-based gene discovery in order to facilitate crop improvement."

"28314904","abstracttext_key message","The AtOR gene enhances carotenoid levels in corn by promoting the formation of plastoglobuli when the carotenoid pool is limited, but has no further effect when carotenoids are already abundant. The cauliflower orange (or) gene mutation influences carotenoid accumulation in plants by promoting the transition of proplastids into chromoplasts, thus creating intracellular storage compartments that act as metabolic sink. We overexpressed the Arabidopsis OR gene under the control of the endosperm-specific wheat LMW glutenin promoter in a white corn variety that normally accumulates only trace amounts of carotenoids. The total endosperm carotenoid content in the best-performing AtOR transgenic corn line was 32-fold higher than wild-type controls (~25 µg/g DW at 30 days after pollination) but the principal carotenoids remained the same, suggesting that AtOR increases the abundance of existing carotenoids without changing the metabolic composition. We analyzed the expression of endogenous genes representing the carotenoid biosynthesis and MEP pathways, as well as the plastid fusion/translocation factor required for chromoplast formation, but only the DXS1 gene was upregulated in the transgenic corn plants. The line expressing AtOR at the highest level was crossed with four transgenic corn lines expressing different carotenogenic genes and accumulating different carotenoids. The introgression of AtOR increased the carotenoid content of the hybrids when there was a limited carotenoid pool in the parental line, but had no effect when carotenoids were already abundant in the parent. The AtOR gene therefore appears to enhance carotenoid levels by promoting the formation of carotenoid-sequestering plastoglobuli when the carotenoid pool is limited, but has no further effect when carotenoids are already abundant because high levels of carotenoids can induce the formation of carotenoid-sequestering plastoglobuli even in the absence of AtOR."

"30999131","abstracttext","Recent years have witnessed a renewed interest in introns as a tool to increase gene expression. We previously isolated TdSHN1 gene encoding a transcription factor in durum wheat. Here we show that TdSHN1 intron contains many CT-stretches and the motif CGATT known to be important for IME. When subjected to bioinformatics analysis using IMEter software, TdSHN1 intron obtained a score of 17.04 which indicates that it can moderately enhance gene expression. TdSHN1 gene including its intron was placed under the control of TdSHN1 endogenous salt and drought-inducible promoter or the constitutive 35S promoter and transferred into tobacco. Transgenic lines were obtained and designated gD (with 35S promoter) and PI (with native promoter). A third construct was also used in which intron-less cDNA was driven by the 35S promoter (cD lines). Results showed that, gD lines exhibited lower stomatal density than cD lines. When subjected to drought and salt stresses, gD lines outperformed intron-less cD lines and WT. Indeed, gD lines exhibited longer roots, higher biomass production, retained more chlorophyll, produced less ROS and MDA and had higher antioxidant activity. qRT-PCR analysis revealed that gD lines had higher TdSHN1 expression levels than cD lines. In addition, expression of ROS-scavengering, stress-related and wax biosynthesis tobacco genes was higher in gD lines compared to cD lines and WT. Interestingly, under stress conditions, PI transgenic lines showed higher TdSHN1 expression levels and outperformed gD lines. These results suggest that TdSHN1 intron enhances gene expression when used alone or in combination with TdSHN1 endogenous promoter."

"32523804","abstracttext","Wheat cultivar Een1, 34 near isogenic lines (NILs), and two cultivars were used as plant materials to evaluate the resistance of Een1 to leaf rust disease. Infection type identification and gene postulation were carried out by inoculation of 12 Chinese Puccinia triticina ( Pt ) pathotypes. Based on the unique phenotype of Een1, we speculated that Een1 might carry Lr gene(s) different from the tested ones. The chromosomal locations for resistance gene to leaf rust disease was employed using SSR primers mapping the populations derived from the cross between Een1 and susceptible Thatcher. A total of 285 plants in the F 2 population were tested by inoculating Pt pathotype FHNQ during the seedling stage. Results from the segregation analysis fits a ratio of 3:1 ( χ 3 : 1 2 = 2 . 37 , P  = 0.12), indicating the presence of a single dominant gene in Een1 conferring resistance to FHNQ. A total of 1,255 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primers were first used to identify the likely linked markers based on bulk segregation analysis (BSA), and then those likely linked markers were further genotyped in the F 2 population for linkage analysis. Our linkage analysis found that the resistance gene ( LrE1 ) was distal to seven SSR loci on the long arm of chromosome 7B, with distances from 2.6 cM ( Xgwm344 ) to 27.1 cM ( Xgwm131 ). The closest marker Xgwm344 was further verified with F 3 lines."

"30652290","abstracttext","The advanced biotechnology CRISPR/Cas9 as a powerful genome editing tool has displayed great potential for improving important agronomic traits such as yield and quality. It has gained momentum worldwide for gene function research of plants in recent years. As for cereals, numerous studies of CRISPR/Cas9 have been reported predominately on rice and quite a few on other cereals including maize, wheat, and barley. In contrast, there are only a couple of reports on sorghum up to date. In this chapter, the CRISPR/Cas9 system has been investigated for sorghum genome editing through biolistic bombardment. Two target genes, cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and phytoene desaturase (PDS), have been investigated by CRISPR/Cas9 though bomboarment. Successful genome editing has been achieved within the sorghum genotype Tx430. Furthermore, sequencing PCR product of transgenic plants has confirmed that the CRISPR/Cas9 successfully edited the target gene in sorghum. Both homozygosis and heterozygosis editings of CAD gene have been confirmed in T 0 primary transgenic lines through sequencing PCR products. T 1 generation of CRISPR plants has been investigated as well. The results illustrated that the edited gene has passed down to next generation. More experiments, such as optimizing promoters for guide RNA (gRNA) and Cas9 in sorghum, are under investigation. Three factors were considered crucial elements to establish an efficient CRISPR/Cas9 system for genome editing in sorghum: (1) an efficient transformation system, (2) the design of targeted gene sequence for gRNA, (3) effective expression of CRISPR components including Cas9 and gRNA."
"31809785","articletitle","Fusaristatin A production negatively affects the growth and aggressiveness of the wheat pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum."
"31809785","abstracttext","Fusarium pseudograminearum (Fp), the causative fungal pathogen of the diseases Fusarium crown rot, is an important constraint to cereals production in many countries including Australia. Fp produces a number of secondary metabolites throughout its life cycle. One of these metabolites, the cyclic lipopeptide fusaristatin A, is encoded by a specific gene cluster containing a polyketide synthase and a three-module non-ribosomal peptide synthetase. However, a recent survey of Fp populations across Australia suggests that this cluster may only be present in a subset of isolates from Western Australia (WA). In this study, we screened 319 Fp isolates from WA and 110 Fp isolates from the Australian eastern states of New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia to examine the distribution of this gene cluster among Australian Fp populations. The fusaristatin A gene cluster was found to be present in ~50% of Fp isolates from WA but completely absent in Fp isolates from eastern states. To determine its potential function, mutants of the fusaristatin A gene cluster were generated by disrupting the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase and polyketide synthase genes simultaneously in two different parental backgrounds. The mutants showed increased growth rates and were significantly more aggressive than their respective parental strains on wheat in crown rot pathogenicity assays. This suggested that fusaristatin A has a negative effect on fungal development and aggressiveness. The possible reasons for the geographically restricted presence of the fusaristatin A gene cluster and its role in fungal biology are discussed."

"31495403","abstracttext","Azotobacters have been used as biofertilizer since more than a century. Azotobacters fix nitrogen aerobically, elaborate plant hormones, solubilize phosphates and also suppress phytopathogens or reduce their deleterious effect. Application of wild type Azotobacters results in better yield of cereals like corn, wheat, oat, barley, rice, pearl millet and sorghum, of oil seeds like mustard and sunflower, of vegetable crops like tomato, eggplant, carrot, chillies, onion, potato, beans and sugar beet, of fruits like mango and sugar cane, of fiber crops like jute and cotton and of tree like oak. In addition to the structural genes of the enzyme nitrogenase and of other accessory proteins, A. vinelandii chromosomes contain the regulatory genes nifL and nifA. NifA must bind upstream of the promoters of all nif operons for enabling their expression. NifL on activation by oxygen or ammonium, interacts with NifA and neutralizes it. Nitrogen fixation has been enhanced by deletion of nifL and by bringing nifA under the control of a constitutive promoter, resulting in a strain that continues to fix nitrogen in presence of urea fertilizer. Additional copies of nifH (the gene for the Fe-protein of nitrogenase) have been introduced into A. vinelandii, thereby augmenting nitrogen fixation. The urease gene complex ureABC has been deleted, the ammonia transport gene amtB has been disrupted and the expression of the glutamine synthase gene has been regulated to enhance urea and ammonia excretion. Gluconic acid has been produced by introducing the glucose dehydrogenase gene, resulting in enhanced solubilization of phosphate."
"33016606","articletitle","Machine learning analyses of methylation profiles uncovers tissue-specific gene expression patterns in wheat."
"33016606","abstracttext","DNA methylation is a mechanism of epigenetic modification in eukaryotic organisms. Generally, methylation within genes promoter inhibits regulatory protein binding and represses transcription, whereas gene body methylation is associated with actively transcribed genes. However, it remains unclear whether there is interaction between methylation levels across genic regions and which site has the biggest impact on gene regulation. We investigated and used the methylation patterns of the bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring to uncover differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between roots and leaves, using six machine learning algorithms and a deep neural network. As anticipated, genes with higher expression in leaves were mainly involved in photosynthesis and pigment biosynthesis processes whereas genes that were not differentially expressed between roots and leaves were involved in protein processes and membrane structures. Methylation occurred preponderantly (60%) in the CG context, whereas 35 and 5% of methylation occurred in CHG and CHH contexts, respectively. Methylation levels were highly correlated (r = 0.7 to 0.9) between all genic regions, except within the promoter (r = 0.4 to 0.5). Machine learning models gave a high (0.81) prediction accuracy of DEGs. There was a strong correlation (p-value = 9.20×10 -10 ) between all features and gene expression, suggesting that methylation across all genic regions contribute to gene regulation. However, the methylation of the promoter, the CDS and the exon in CG context was the most impactful. Our study provides more insights into the interplay between DNA methylation and gene expression and paves the way for identifying tissue-specific genes using methylation profiles."

"16044269","abstracttext","Homology-based gene/gene-analog cloning method has been extensively applied in isolation of RGAs (resistance gene analogs) in various plant species. However, serious interference of sequences on homoeologous chromosomes in polyploidy species usually occurred when cloning RGAs in a specific chromosome. In this research, the techniques of chromosome microdissection combined with homology-based cloning were used to clone RGAs from a specific chromosome of Wheat-Thinopyrum alien addition line TAi-27, which was derived from common wheat and Thinopyrum intermedium with a pair of chromosomes from Th. intermedium. The alien chromosomes carry genes for resistance to BYDV. The alien chromosome in TAi-27 was isolated by a glass needle and digested with proteinase K. The DNA of the alien chromosome was amplified by two rounds of Sau3A linker adaptor-mediated PCR. RGAs were amplified by PCR with the degenerated primers designed based on conserved domains of published resistance genes (R genes) by using the alien chromosome DNA, genomic DNA and cDNA of Th. intermedium, TAi-27 and 3B-2 (a parent of TAi-27) as templates. A total of seven RGAs were obtained and sequenced. Of which, a constitutively expressed single-copy NBS-LRR type RGA ACR 3 was amplified from the dissected alien chromosome of TAi-27, TcDR 2 and TcDR 3 were from cDNA of Th. intermedium, AcDR 3 was from cDNA of TAi-27, FcDR 2 was from cDNA of 3B-2, AR 2 was from genomic DNA of TAi-27 and TR 2 was from genomic DNA of Th. intermedium. Sequence homology analyses showed that the above RGAs were highly homologous with known resistance genes or resistance gene analogs and belonged to NBS-LRR type of R genes. ACR 3 was recovered by PCR from genomic DNA and cDNA of Th. intermedium and TAi-27, but not from 3B-2. Southern hybridization using the digested genomic DNA of Th. intermedium, TAi-27 and 3B-2 as the template and ACR 3 as the probe showed that there is only one copy of ACR 3 in the genome of Th. intermedium and TAi-27, but it is absent in 3B-2. The ACR 3 could be used as a specific probe of the R gene on the alien chromosome of TAi-27. Results of Northern hybridization suggested that ACR 3 was constitutively expressed in Th. intermedium and TAi-27, but not 3B-2, and expressed higher in leaves than in roots. This research demonstrated a new way to clone RGAs located on a specific chromosome. The information reported here should be useful to understand the resistance mechanism of, and to clone resistant genes from, the alien chromosome in TAi-27."

"17318493","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the preferred control of the disease. The spring wheat cultivar 'Alpowa' has both race-specific, all-stage resistance and non-race-specific, high-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistances to stripe rust. To identify genes for the stripe rust resistances, Alpowa was crossed with 'Avocet Susceptible' (AVS). Seedlings of the parents, and F(1), F(2) and F(3) progeny were tested with races PST-1 and PST-21 of P. striiformis f. sp. tritici under controlled greenhouse conditions. Alpowa has a single partially dominant gene, designated as YrAlp, conferring all-stage resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to YrAlp. A linkage group of five RGAP markers and two SSR markers was constructed for YrAlp using 136 F(3) lines. Amplification of a set of nulli-tetrasomic Chinese Spring lines with RGAP markers Xwgp47 and Xwgp48 and the two SSR markers indicated that YrAlp is located on the short arm of chromosome 1B. To map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for the non-race-specific HTAP resistance, the parents and 136 F(3) lines were tested at two sites near Pullman and one site near Mount Vernon, Washington, under naturally infected conditions. A major HTAP QTL was consistently detected across environments and was located on chromosome 7BL. Because of its chromosomal location and the non-race-specific nature of the HTAP resistance, this gene is different from previously described genes for adult-plant resistance, and is therefore designated Yr39. The gene contributed to 64.2% of the total variation of relative area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) data and 59.1% of the total variation of infection type data recorded at the heading-flowering stages. Two RGAP markers, Xwgp36 and Xwgp45 with the highest R (2) values were closely linked to Yr39, should be useful for incorporation of the non-race-specific resistance gene into new cultivars and for combining Yr39 with other genes for durable and high-level resistance."

The phenotypic response of NILs carrying combinations of Sumai 3 derived genes suggested non-additive responses and Fhb5 was as good as Fhb1 in conferring field resistance in both populations. In addition to Fhb1, Fhb2, and Fhb5, four to five resistance improving alleles in both populations were identified and three of five in CDC Go were contributed by the susceptible parent. The introgressed chromosome regions carried genes encoding disease resistance proteins, protein kinases, nucleotide-binding and leucine rich repeats' domains. Complex epistatic gene-gene interactions among marker loci (including Fhb1, Fhb2, Fhb5) explained > 20% of the phenotypic variation in FHB measurements."
"31053089","abstracttext_conclusions","Immediate Sumai 3 derivatives carry a number of resistance improving minor effect alleles, other than Fhb1, Fhb2, Fhb5. Results verified that marker-assisted selection is possible for the introgression of exotic FHB resistance genes, however, the genetic background of the recipient line and epistatic interactions can have a strong influence on expression and penetrance of any given gene."
"3967626","articletitle","Biosynthesis of calcitonin by human lung cancer cells."
"3967626","abstracttext","The ectopic secretion of calcitonin (CT) by a wide variety of nonthyroidal human tumors has been studied by CT RIA, but little information is available concerning the biosynthesis of CT in these tumors. In the present study, a human lung cancer cell line (BEN), secreting high mol wt forms of CT was investigated to characterize the CT gene products synthesized. When conditioned medium from BEN cells was chromatographed through a Bio-Gel P-30 column, larger species of immunoreactive CT were detected with mol wt of approximately 8,000 and 18,000. Little, if any, CT of 3,500 mol wt was detected. To examine CT gene products produced in BEN cells, poly A+ RNA was isolated from BEN cells and subjected to cell-free translation assays and DNA/RNA hybridization assays. In the wheat germ cell-free translation assay, a single BEN cell product which migrated on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with an apparent mol wt of 17,000 could be specifically immunoprecipitated with CT antisera. A similar sized CT-related translation product is produced in wheat germ assays programmed by mRNA prepared from human medullary thyroid carcinomas. In DNA/RNA hybridization assays, a single BEN cell mRNA species of 1,000 base pairs, identical in size to human thyroidal CT mRNA, hybridized to a radiolabeled CT cDNA probe. Hybridization of the CT cDNA probe with BEN cell mRNA was confirmed by RNA dot blot hybridization and cytoplasmic RNA blotting procedures. These results indicate that larger mol wt forms of CT secreted by BEN cells are derived from a translation product and a mRNA which are of similar, if not identical, size as CT gene products produced in human thyroidal tissues. The inability of lung tumor cells to process the CT precursor to calcitonin of 3,500 mol wt may reflect a lack of specific prohormone processing enzymes in these tumor cells or may be due to structural polymorphism in the CT precursor expressed in the lung cells."

"1603062","abstracttext","We have recently identified a tRNA gene cluster in the Arabidopsis nuclear genome. One tRNA(Ser) (AGA) gene and two tRNA(Tyr) (GTA) genes occur in tandem arrangement on a 1.5 kb unit that is amplified about 20-fold at a single chromosomal site. Here we have studied the in vitro expression of seven individually cloned tRNA(Ser) genes (pAtS1 to pAtS7) derived from this cluster. Five out of the seven tRNA(Ser) genes contain point mutations in the coding region which have in part adverse effects on the expression of these genes in different cell-free systems: (i) C10 and A62 in plant tRNA(Ser) genes, which correspond to G10 and C62, respectively, in all known vertebrate tRNA genes, result in a reduced transcription efficiency in HeLa but not in yeast extract. This indicates that yeast RNA polymerase III tolerates nucleotide substitutions at positions 10 [5' internal control region (ICR)] and 62 (3' ICR), whereas the vertebrate RNA polymerase III requires a more stringent consensus sequence. (ii) Processing of a pre-tRNA(Ser) with a mismatch in the aminoacyl stem is impaired in HeLa, yeast and wheat germ extracts, however, a mismatch in the anticodon stem is deleterious for HeLa and wheat germ but not for yeast processing enzymes. The unexpectedly high number of potential tRNA(Ser) pseudogenes in the cluster - quite in contrast to the tRNA(Ser) genes which mainly code for functional tRNAs - suggested that tRNA(Ser) (AGA) genes also occur elsewhere in the genome. We present evidence that single copies of tRNA(Ser) (AGA) genes do indeed exist outside the tRNA gene cluster."

"11931668","abstracttext","The faeB gene encoding a second feruloyl esterase from Aspergillus niger has been cloned and characterized. It consists of an open reading frame of 1644 bp containing one intron. The gene encodes a protein of 521 amino acids that has sequence similarity to that of an Aspergillus oryzae tannase. However, the encoded enzyme, feruloyl esterase B (FAEB), does not have tannase activity. Comparison of the physical characteristics and substrate specificity of FAEB with those of a cinnamoyl esterase from A. niger [Kroon, Faulds and Williamson (1996) Biotechnol. Appl. Biochem. 23, 255-262] suggests that they are in fact the same enzyme. The expression of faeB is specifically induced in the presence of certain aromatic compounds, but not in the presence of other constituents present in plant-cell-wall polysaccharides such as arabinoxylan or pectin. The expression profile of faeB in the presence of aromatic compounds was compared with the expression of A. niger faeA, encoding feruloyl esterase A (FAEA), and A. niger bphA, the gene encoding a benzoate-p-hydroxylase. All three genes have different subsets of aromatic compounds that induce their expression, indicating the presence of different transcription activating systems in A. niger that respond to aromatic compounds. Comparison of the activity of FAEA and FAEB on sugar-beet pectin and wheat arabinoxylan demonstrated that they are both involved in the degradation of both polysaccharides, but have opposite preferences for these substrates. FAEA is more active than FAEB towards wheat arabinoxylan, whereas FAEB is more active than FAEA towards sugar-beet pectin."
"15821867","articletitle","The complex developmental expression of a novel stress-responsive barley Ltp gene is determined by a shortened promoter sequence."
"15821867","abstracttext","The search for a cereal promoter capable of driving preferential transgene expression in the pericarp epidermis (epicarp) of developing barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) resulted in the cloning of a novel gene. This encoded a polypeptide of 124 amino acids showing 87 identity with WBP1A, a wheat lipid transfer protein (LTP), but much lower homology to other barley LTPs. In addition to the epicarp, this Ltp-like gene, Ltp6, is highly expressed in coleoptiles and embryos under normal growth conditions. Messenger RNA levels increased in seedling tissues during salt and cold treatments and under applied abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA). Taken together, Ltp6 tissue-specific and response patterns are distinct from other known barley Ltp genes. Inverse PCR was used to derive 2345 bp of upstream Ltp6 sequence. The level of transcription conferred by different promoter deletion constructs was assessed by quantitative real time RT-PCR using gfp as a reporter in transient expression assays. All constructs containing at least 192 bp of upstream sequence and the 5'UTR conferred tissue-specific expression and retained most of the promoter strength. Deletion of 64 bp (-192/-128) from this upstream sequence reduced expression levels by 80. Moreover, a minimal 247 bp Ltp6 promoter continuously drove gfp expression during spike development, from early ovary differentiation through its final expression in the epicarp and during embryogenesis and germination in transgenic barley, reproducing the expression pattern of the native gene. The potential use of this promoter sequence for targeting transgene-mediated disease resistance in barley and wheat is discussed."

"14740085","abstracttext","A novel y-type high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit possessing a slightly faster mobility than that of subunit 1Dy12 in SDS-PAGE, designated 1Dy12.1(t) in Aegilops tauschi, was identified by one- and two-dimensional gel and capillary electrophoresis. Its coding gene at the Glu-D(t) 1 locus was amplified with allele-specific-PCR primers, and the amplified products were cloned and sequenced. The complete nucleotide sequence of 2,807 bp containing an open reading frame of 1,950 bp and 857 bp of upstream sequence was obtained. A perfectly conserved enhancer sequence and the -300 element were present at positions of 209-246 bp and 424-447 bp upstream of the ATG start codon, respectively. The deduced mature protein of 1 Dy12.1(t) subunit comprised 648 amino acid residues and had a Mr of 67,518 Da, which is slightly smaller than the 1Dy12 (68,695 Da) but larger than the 1Dy10 (67,495 Da) subunits of bread wheat, respectively, and corresponds well with their relative mobilities when separated by acid-PAGE. The deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the 1Dy12.1(t) subunit displayed a greater similarity to the 1Dy10 subunit, with only seven amino acid substitutions, suggesting that this novel gene could have positive effect on bread-making quality. A phenetic tree produced by nucleotide sequences showed that the x- and y-type subunit genes were respectively clustered together and that the Glu-D(t) 1y12.1 gene of Ae. tauschii is closely related to other y-type subunit genes from the B and D genomes of hexaploid bread wheat."

"18270740","abstracttext","Previously, the genes encoding non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) of the Poaceae family appear to evidence different genomic distribution and somewhat different shares of EST clones, which is suggestive of independent duplication(s) followed by functional diversity. To further evaluate the evolutionary fate of the Poaceae nsLTP genes, we have identified Ka/Ks values, conserved, mutated or lost cis-regulatory elements, responses to several elicitors, genome-wide expression profiles, and nsLTP gene-coexpression networks of both (or either) wheat and rice. The Ka/Ks values within each group and between groups appeared to be similar, but not identical, in both species. The conserved cis-regulatory elements, e.g. the RY repeat (CATGCA) element related to ABA regulation in group A, might be reflected in some degree of long-term conservation in transcriptional regulation post-dating speciation. In group A, wheat nsLTP genes, with the exception of TaLTP4, evidenced responses similar to those of plant elicitors; however, the rice nsLTP genes evidenced differences in expression profiles, even though the genes of both species have undergone purifying selection, thereby suggesting their independent functional diversity. The expression profiles of rice nsLTP genes with a microarray dataset of 155 gene expression omnibus sample (GSM) plates suggest that subfunctionalization is not the sole mechanism inherent to the evolutionary history of nsLTP genes but may, rather, function in concert with other mechanism(s). As inferred by the nsLTP gene-coexpression networks, the functional diversity of nsLTP genes appears not to be randomized, but rather to be specialized in the direction of specific biological processes over evolutionary time."
"16160850","articletitle","Function and transcript analysis of gibberellin-biosynthetic enzymes in wheat."
"16160850","abstracttext","The enzymes gibberellin (GA) 20-oxidase and 3-oxidase are major sites of regulation in GA biosynthesis. We have characterised one member of each of the gene families encoding these enzymes that are highly expressed in elongating stems and in developing and germinating grains of wheat and are therefore likely to have prominent developmental roles in these tissues. We mapped the three homoeologues of the GA 20-oxidase gene TaGA20ox1 to chromosomes 5BL, 5DL and 4AL. TaGA20ox1 is expressed mainly in the nodes and ears of the elongating stem, and also in developing and germinating embryos. Expression in the nodes, ears and germinating embryos is predominantly from the A and D genomes. Each homoeologous cDNA encodes a functional enzyme that catalyses the multi-step conversions of GA12-GA9, and GA53-GA20. Time course and enzyme kinetic studies indicate that the initial oxidation steps from GA12 and GA53 to the free alcohol forms of GA15 and GA44, respectively, occur rapidly but that subsequent steps occur more slowly. The intermediate GA19 has an especially low affinity for the enzyme, consistent with its accumulation in wheat tissues. The three homoeologous cDNAs for the 3-oxidase gene TaGA3ox2 encode functional enzymes, one of which was shown to possess low levels of 2beta-hydroxylase, 2,3-desaturase, 2,3-epoxidase and even 13-hydroxylase activities in addition to 3beta-hydroxylase activity. In contrast to TaGA20ox1, TaGA3ox2 is expressed in internodes, as well as nodes and the ear of the elongating stem. It is also highly expressed in developing and germinated embryos."
"16349332","articletitle","Contribution of the Global Regulator Gene gacA to Persistence and Dissemination of Pseudomonas fluorescens Biocontrol Strain CHA0 Introduced into Soil Microcosms."
"16349332","abstracttext","Structural and regulatory genes involved in the synthesis of antimicrobial metabolites are essential for the biocontrol activity of fluorescent pseudomonads and, in principle, amenable to genetic engineering for strain improvement. An eventual large-scale release of such bacteria raises the question of whether such genes also contribute to the persistence and dissemination of the bacteria in soil ecosystems. Pseudomonas fluorescens wild-type strain CHA0 protects plants against a variety of fungal diseases and produces several antimicrobial metabolites. The regulatory gene gacA globally controls antibiotic production and is crucial for disease suppression in CHA0. This gene also regulates the production of extracellular protease and phospholipase. The contribution of gacA to survival and vertical translocation of CHA0 in soil microcosms of increasing complexity was studied in coinoculation experiments with the wild type and a gacA mutant which lacks antibiotics and some exoenzymes. Both strains were marked with spontaneous resistance to rifampin. In a closed system with sterile soil, strain CHA0 and the gacA mutant multiplied for several weeks, whereas these strains declined exponentially in nonsterile soil of different Swiss origins. The gacA mutant was less persistent in nonrhizosphere raw soil than was the wild type, but no competitive disadvantage when colonizing the rhizosphere and roots of wheat was found in the particular soil type and during the period studied. Vertical translocation was assessed after strains had been applied to undisturbed, long (60-cm) or short (20-cm) soil columns, both planted with wheat. A smaller number of cells of the gacA mutant than of the wild type were detected in the percolated water and in different depths of the soil column. Single-strain inoculation gave similar results in all microcosms tested. We conclude that mutation in a single regulatory gene involved in antibiotic and exoenzyme synthesis can affect the survival of P. fluorescens more profoundly in unplanted soil than in the rhizosphere."

"18944087","abstracttext","Aegilops sharonensis (Sharon goatgrass) is a wild relative of wheat and a rich source of genetic diversity for disease resistance. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic basis of leaf rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew resistance in A. sharonensis and also the allelic relationships between genes controlling resistance to each disease. Progeny from crosses between resistant and susceptible accessions were evaluated for their disease reaction at the seedling and/or adult plant stage to determine the number and action of genes conferring resistance. Two different genes conferring resistance to leaf rust races THBJ and BBBB were identified in accessions 1644 and 603. For stem rust, the same single gene was found to confer resistance to race TTTT in accessions 1644 and 2229. Resistance to stem rust race TPMK was conferred by two genes in accessions 1644 and 603. A contingency test revealed no association between genes conferring resistance to leaf rust race THBJ and stem rust race TTTT or between genes conferring resistance to stem rust race TTTT and powdery mildew isolate UM06-01, indicating that the respective resistance genes are not linked. Three accessions (1644, 2229, and 1193) were found to carry a single gene for resistance to powdery mildew. Allelism tests revealed that the resistance gene in accession 1644 is different from the respective single genes present in either 2229 or 1193. The simple inheritance of leaf rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew resistance in A. sharonensis should simplify the transfer of resistance to wheat in wide crosses."

"17246194","abstracttext","Metaphase I (MI) pairing of homologous chromosomes in wheat intercultivar hybrids (heterohomologous chromosomes) is usually reduced relative to that within the inbred parental cultivars (euhomologous chromosomes). It was proposed elsewhere that this phenomenon is caused by polymorphism in nucleotide sequences (nonstructural chromosome variation) among wheat cultivars. The distribution of this polymorphism along chromosome arm 6Bp (=6BS) of cultivars Chinese Spring and Cheyenne was investigated. A population of potentially recombinant chromosomes derived from crossing over between telosome 6Bp of Chinese Spring and Cheyenne chromosome 6B was developed in the isogenic background of Chinese Spring. The approximate length of the Chinese Spring segment present in each of these chromosomes was assessed by determining for each chromosome the interval in which crossing over occurred (utilizing the rRNA gene region, a distal C-band and the gliadin gene region as markers). The MI pairing frequencies of these chromosomes (only the complete chromosomes were used) with the normal Chinese Spring telosome 6Bp were determined. These were directly proportional to the length of the euhomologous segment. The longer the incorporated euhomologous segment the better was the MI pairing. This provided evidence that the heterohomologous chromosomes are differentiated from each other in numerous sites distributed throughout the arm.-The comparison of the physical map of arm 6Bp with the linkage map showed a remarkable distortion of the linkage map; no crossing over was detected in the proximal 68% of the arm. A population of 49 recombinant chromosomes was assayed for recombination within the rRNA gene region, but none was detected. No new length variants of the nontranscribed spacer separating the 18S and 26S rRNA genes were detected either."
"17133861","articletitle","Effects of competition on the fitness of wild and crop-wild hybrid sunflower from a diversity of wild populations and crop lines."
"17133861","abstracttext","Gene flow between crop fields and wild populations often results in hybrids with reduced fitness compared to their wild counterparts due to characteristics imparted by the crop genome. But the specifics of the evolutionary outcome of crop-wild gene flow may depend on context, varying due to local environmental conditions and genetic variation within and among wild populations and among crop lines. To evaluate context-dependence of fitness of F1 hybrids, sunflower crop lines were crossed with nine wild populations from across the northern United States. These crop-wild hybrids and their wild counterparts were grown under agricultural conditions in the field with and without wheat competition. Hybrids were far less fecund than wild plants, yet more likely to survive to reproduce. There was considerable variability among wild populations for fecundity and the specific crop line used to generate the crop-wild hybrid significantly affected fecundity. The fitness deficit suffered by crop-wild hybrids varied by population, as did the rankings of the crop-wild hybrids from three different crop lines. Wheat competition decreased fecundity and survival considerably and hampered seed production of wild plants more than that of hybrids. Genotype x environment interactions indicated that the response of fitness to competition differed by population. Consequently, the fitness of hybrids relative to wild plants varied considerably among wild populations and was not consistent across environments. Notably, relative fitness of hybrids was greater under competitive conditions. This research is the first study of its kind to demonstrate that the consequences of crop-wild gene flow are context dependent and contingent on the genetics of the specific wild populations and the local biotic and abiotic conditions."

"17004014","abstracttext","Transposable elements have certain advantages over other approaches for identifying and determining gene function in large genome cereals. Different strategies have been used to exploit the maize Activator/dissociation (Ac/Ds) transposon system for functional genomics in heterologous species. Either large numbers of independent Ds insertion lines or transposants (TNPs) are generated and screened phenotypically, or smaller numbers of TNPs are produced, Ds locations mapped and remobilized for localized gene targeting. It is imperative to characterize key features of the system in order to utilize the latter strategy, which is more feasible in large genome cereals like barley and wheat. In barley, we generated greater than 100 single-copy Ds TNPs and determined remobilization frequencies of primary, secondary, and tertiary TNPs with intact terminal inverted repeats (TIRs); frequencies ranged from 11.8 to 17.1%. In 16% of TNPs that had damaged TIRs no transposition was detected among progeny of crosses using those TNPs as parental lines. In half of the greater than 100 TNP lines, the nature of flanking sequences and status of the 11 bp TIRs and 8-bp direct repeats were determined. BLAST searches using a gene prediction program revealed that 86% of TNP flanking sequences matched either known or putative genes, indicating preferential Ds insertion into genic regions, critical in large genome species. Observed remobilization frequencies of primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary TNPs, coupled with the tendency for localized Ds transposition, validates a saturation mutagenesis approach using Ds to tag and characterize genes linked to Ds in large genome cereals like barley and wheat."

"19594316","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. tritici, is one of the most widespread and destructive wheat diseases in areas where cool temperatures prevail. The wheat cv. Renan, carrying the specific gene Yr17, has shown effective resistance for a long time, even though some pathotypes overcame the Yr17 gene. The objectives of this study were to locate and map genetic loci associated with adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between Renan (resistant) and Récital (susceptible). Field assays were performed for 4 years (1995, 1996, 2005, and 2006) to score disease-progress data and identify APR quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Three QTLs, QYr.inra-2BS, QYr.inra-3BS, and QYr.inra-6B, with resistance alleles derived from Renan were detected in 1995 to 1996 with the 237E141 pathotype, which is avirulent against genotypes carrying Yr17. These QTLs were stable and explained a major part of the phenotypic variation seen in 2005 to 2006, when the 237E141 V17 pathotype was used. Each of these QTLs contributed approximately 4 to 15% of the phenotypic variance and was effective at different adult plant stages. Interactions were observed between some markers of the Yr17 gene and three Renan QTLs: QYr.inra-2BS, QYr.inra-3BS, and QYr.inra-6B. Resistance based on the combination of different APR types should provide durable resistance to P. striiformis."

"22028874","abstracttext","Wheat is one of the world's most important crops and is characterized by a large polyploid genome. One way to reduce genome complexity is to isolate single chromosomes using flow cytometry. Low coverage DNA sequencing can provide a snapshot of individual chromosomes, allowing a fast characterization of their main features and comparison with other genomes. We used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing to obtain a 2x coverage of wheat chromosome 5A. The resulting sequence assembly was used to identify TEs, genes and miRNAs, as well as to infer a virtual gene order based on the synteny with other grass genomes. Repetitive elements account for more than 75% of the genome. Gene content was estimated considering non-redundant reads showing at least one match to ESTs or proteins. The results indicate that the coding fraction represents 1.08% and 1.3% of the short and long arm respectively, projecting the number of genes of the whole chromosome to approximately 5,000. 195 candidate miRNA precursors belonging to 16 miRNA families were identified. The 5A genes were used to search for syntenic relationships between grass genomes. The short arm is closely related to Brachypodium chromosome 4, sorghum chromosome 8 and rice chromosome 12; the long arm to regions of Brachypodium chromosomes 4 and 1, sorghum chromosomes 1 and 2 and rice chromosomes 9 and 3. From these similarities it was possible to infer the virtual gene order of 392 (5AS) and 1,480 (5AL) genes of chromosome 5A, which was compared to, and found to be largely congruent with the available physical map of this chromosome."

Consistent with the fact that in NAUH117 there presented a chromosome fragment deletion, which led to its increased FHB susceptibility, in Wangshuibai, twenty out of eighty-nine genes showed changed expression patterns upon the infection of Fg. The up-regulation of eight of them was confirmed by qRT-PCR, revealing they may be candidate genes for Fhb1 and need further functional analysis to confirm their roles in FHB resistance."

"20822422","abstracttext","Ustilago hordei interactions on coleoptiles of barley host cultivars Odessa (compatible), Hannchen (incompatible, carrying the Ruh1 resistance gene), and on nonhost Neepawa wheat were studied using light and fluorescent microscopy. Autofluorescence, mainly caused by callose accumulation, was more rapidly expressed in nonhost wheat at 30 to 72 h compared with the incompatible reaction between 72 and 144 h. Microarray results demonstrated that more than half of the 893 differentially regulated genes were observed in Neepawa; of these genes, 45% fell into the defense- and stress-related classes in Neepawa compared with 25 and 37% in Odessa and Hannchen, respectively. Their expression coincided with the early morphological defense responses observed and were associated with the jasmonic acid and ethylene (JA/ET) signaling pathway. Expression patterns in Odessa and Hannchen were similar, involving fewer genes and coinciding with later morphological defense responses of these varieties. Although no visible hypersensitive response was apparent in Hannchen or Neepawa, specific upregulation of hypersensitivity-related proteins was observed, such as beta-VPE at 48 h. Expression levels of the callose synthase gene were closely associated with callose accumulation. Differential responses in defense-gene expression among disease reaction types included upregulation of PR-1.1b and downregulation of a nonspecific lipid transfer protein in the incompatible and compatible interactions, respectively. Transcript levels of EDS1 and PAD4, involved in both basal resistance and R-mediated resistance to avirulent pathogens, were up-regulated during both nonhost and Ruh1-mediated resistance. Application of methyl-jasmonate, salicylic acid and ET to leaves revealed that only PR1.1b is strongly up-regulated by all three compounds, while the majority of the defense-related genes are only slightly up-regulated by these signaling compounds."

The Δzif1 mutant generated by gene replacement was significantly reduced in deoxynivalenol (DON) production and virulence on flowering wheat heads. It was defective in spreading from inoculated florets to the rachis and other spikelets. Deletion of the ZIF1 ortholog MoZIF1 in the rice blast fungus also caused reductions in virulence and in invasive growth. In addition, the Δzif1 mutant is defective in sexual reproduction. Although it had normal male fertility, when selfed or mated as the female in outcrosess, the Δzif1 mutant produced small, pigmented perithecia that were sterile (lack of asci and ascospores), suggesting a female-specific role for ZIF1 during fertilization or ascus development. Similar female-specific defects in sexual reproduction were observed in the ΔMozif1 mutant. When mated as the female, the ΔMozif1 perithecia failed to develop long necks and asci or ascospores. The ZIF1 gene is well conserved in filamentous ascomycetes, particularly in the b-ZIP domain, which is essential for its function. Expression of ZIF1 in Magnaporthe oryzae complemented the defects of the ΔMozif1 mutant. These results indicate that this b-ZIP transcription factor is functionally conserved in these two fungal pathogens for plant infection and sexual reproduction."

"20943185","abstracttext","Fusarium culmorum is a major pathogen of wheat and barley causing head blight and crown rot in cooler temperate climates of Australia, Europe, West Asia and North Africa. To better understand its evolutionary history we partially sequenced single copy nuclear genes encoding translation elongation factor 1-α (TEF), reductase (RED) and phosphate permease (PHO) in 100 F. culmorum isolates with 11 isolates of Fusarium crookwellense, Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium pseudograminearum. Phylogenetic analysis of multilocus sequence (MLS) data using Bayesian inference and maximum parsimony analysis showed that F. culmorum from wheat is a single phylogenetic species with no significant linkage disequilibrium and little or no lineage development along geographic origin. Both MLS and TEF and RED gene sequence analysis separated the four Fusarium species used and delineated three to four groups within the F. culmorum clade. But the PHO gene could not completely resolve isolates into their respective species. Fixation index and gene flow suggest significant genetic exchange between the isolates from distant geographic regions. A lack of strong lineage structure despite the geographic separation of the three collections indicates a frequently recombining species and/or widespread distribution of genotypes due to international trade, tourism and long-range dispersal of macroconidia. Moreover, the two mating type genes were present in equal proportion among the F. culmorum collection used in this study, leaving open the possibility of sexual reproduction."
"21138346","articletitle","The HDF1 histone deacetylase gene is important for conidiation, sexual reproduction, and pathogenesis in Fusarium graminearum."
"21138346","abstracttext","Head blight caused by Fusarium graminearum is an important disease of wheat and barley. Its genome contains chromosomal regions with higher genetic variation and enriched for genes expressed in planta, suggesting a role of chromatin modification in the regulation of infection-related genes. In a previous study, the FTL1 gene was characterized as a novel virulence factor in the head blight fungus. FTL1 is homologous to yeast SIF2, which is a component of the Set3 complex. Many members of the yeast Set3 complex, including Hos2 histone deacetylase (HDAC), are conserved in F. graminearum. In this study, we characterized the HDF1 gene that is orthologous to HOS2. HDF1 physically interacted with FTL1 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Deletion of HDF1 resulted in a significant reduction in virulence and deoxynivalenol (DON) production. The Δhdf1 mutant failed to spread from the inoculation site to other parts of wheat heads or corn stalks. It was defective in sexual reproduction and significantly reduced in conidiation. Expression of HDF1 was highest in conidia in comparison with germlings and hyphae. Deletion of HDF1 also resulted in a 60% reduction in HDAC activity. Microarray analysis revealed that 149 and 253 genes were down- and upregulated, respectively, over fivefold in the Δhdf1 mutant. Consistent with upregulation of putative catalase and peroxidase genes, the Δhdf1 mutant was more tolerant to H(2)O(2) than the wild type. Deletion of the other two class II HDAC genes had no obvious effect on vegetative growth and resulted in only a minor reduction in conidiation and virulence in the Δhdf2 mutant. Overall, our results indicate that HDF1 is the major class II HDAC gene in F. graminearum. It may interact with FTL1 and function as a component in a well-conserved HDAC complex in the regulation of conidiation, DON production, and pathogenesis."

"21761163","abstracttext","Earliness is very important for the adaptation of wheat to environmental conditions and the achievement of high grain yield. A detailed knowledge of key genetic components of the life cycle would enable an easier control by the breeders. The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of candidate genes on flowering time. Using a collection of hexaploid wheat composed of 235 lines from diverse geographical origins, we conducted an association study for six candidate genes for flowering time and its components (vernalization sensitivity and earliness per se). The effect on the variation of earliness components of polymorphisms within the copies of each gene was tested in ANOVA models accounting for the underlying genetic structure. The collection was structured in five groups that minimized the residual covariance. Vernalization requirement and lateness tend to increase according to the mean latitude of each group. Heading date for an autumnal sowing was mainly determined by the earliness per se. Except for the Constans (CO) gene orthologous of the barley HvCO3, all gene polymorphisms had a significant impact on earliness components. The three traits used to quantify vernalization requirement were primarily associated with polymorphisms at Vrn-1 and then at Vrn-3 and Luminidependens (LD) genes. We found a good correspondence between spring/winter types and genotypes at the three homeologous copies of Vrn-1. Earliness per se was mainly explained by polymorphisms at Vrn-3 and to a lesser extent at Vrn-1, Hd-1 and Gigantea (GI) genes. Vernalization requirement and earliness as a function of geographical origin, as well as the possible role of the breeding practices in the geographical distribution of the alleles and the hypothetical adaptive value of the candidate genes, are discussed."
"22297565","articletitle","Lr68: a new gene conferring slow rusting resistance to leaf rust in wheat."
"22297565","abstracttext","The common wheat cultivar Parula possesses a high level of slow rusting, adult plant resistance (APR) to all three rust diseases of wheat. Previous mapping studies using an Avocet-YrA/Parula recombinant inbred line (RIL) population showed that APR to leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) in Parula is governed by at least three independent slow rusting resistance genes: Lr34 on 7DS, Lr46 on 1BL, and a previously unknown gene on 7BL. The use of field rust reaction and flanking markers identified two F(6) RILs, Arula1 and Arula2, from the above population that lacked Lr34 and Lr46 but carried the leaf rust resistance gene in 7BL, hereby designated Lr68. Arula1 and Arula2 were crossed with Apav, a highly susceptible line from the cross Avocet-YrA/Pavon 76, and 396 F(4)-derived F(5) RILs were developed for mapping Lr68. The RILs were phenotyped for leaf rust resistance for over 2 years in Ciudad Obregon, Mexico, with a mixture of P. triticina races MBJ/SP and MCJ/SP. Close genetic linkages with several DNA markers on 7BL were established using 367 RILs; Psy1-1 and gwm146 flanked Lr68 and were estimated at 0.5 and 0.6 cM, respectively. The relationship between Lr68 and the race-specific seedling resistance gene Lr14b, located in the same region and present in Parula, Arula1 and Arula2, was investigated by evaluating the RILs with Lr14b-avirulent P. triticina race TCT/QB in the greenhouse. Although Lr14b and Lr68 homozygous recombinants in repulsion were not identified in RILs, γ-irradiation-induced deletion stocks that lacked Lr68 but possessed Lr14b showed that Lr68 and Lr14b are different loci. Flanking DNA markers that are tightly linked to Lr68 in a wide array of genotypes can be utilized for selection of APR to leaf rust."
"22240663","articletitle","Autophagy provides nutrients for nonassimilating fungal structures and is necessary for plant colonization but not for infection in the necrotrophic plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum."
"22240663","abstracttext","The role of autophagy in necrotrophic fungal physiology and infection biology is poorly understood. We have studied autophagy in the necrotrophic plant pathogen Fusarium graminearum in relation to development of nonassimilating structures and infection. We identified an ATG8 homolog F. graminearum ATG8 whose first 116 amino acids before the predicted ATG4 cleavage site are 100% identical to Podospora anserina ATG8. We generated a ΔFgatg8 mutant by gene replacement and showed that this cannot form autophagic compartments. The strain forms no perithecia, has reduced conidia production and the aerial mycelium collapses after a few days in culture. The collapsing aerial mycelium contains lipid droplets indicative of nitrogen starvation and/or an inability to use storage lipids. The capacity to use carbon/energy stored in lipid droplets after a shift from carbon rich conditions to carbon starvation is severely inhibited in the ΔFgatg8 strain demonstrating autophagy-dependent lipid utilization, lipophagy, in fungi. Radial growth rate of the ΔFgatg8 strain is reduced compared with the wild type and the mutant does not grow over inert plastic surfaces in contrast to the wild type. The ability to infect barley and wheat is normal but the mutant is unable to spread from spikelet to spikelet in wheat. Complementation by inserting the F. graminearum atg8 gene into a region adjacent to the actin gene in ΔFgatg8 fully restores the WT phenotype. The results showed that autophagy plays a pivotal role for supplying nutrients to nonassimilating structures necessary for growth and is important for plant colonization. This also indicates that autophagy is a central mechanism for fungal adaptation to nonoptimal C/N ratios."
"22321563","articletitle","Functional variability of the Lr34 durable resistance gene in transgenic wheat."
"22321563","abstracttext","Breeding for durable disease resistance is challenging, yet essential to improve crops for sustainable agriculture. The wheat Lr34 gene is one of the few cloned, durable resistance genes in plants. It encodes an ATP binding cassette transporter and has been a source of resistance against biotrophic pathogens, such as leaf rust (Puccinina triticina), for over 100 years. As endogenous Lr34 confers quantitative resistance, we wanted to determine the effects of transgenic Lr34 with specific reference to how expression levels affect resistance. Transgenic Lr34 wheat lines were made in two different, susceptible genetic backgrounds. We found that the introduction of the Lr34 resistance allele was sufficient to provide comparable levels of leaf rust resistance as the endogenous Lr34 gene. As with the endogenous gene, we observed resistance in seedlings after cold treatment and in flag leaves of adult plants, as well as Lr34-associated leaf tip necrosis. The transgene-based Lr34 resistance did not involve a hypersensitive response, altered callose deposition or up-regulation of PR genes. Higher expression levels compared to endogenous Lr34 were observed in the transgenic lines both at seedling as well as adult stage and some improvement of resistance was seen in the flag leaf. Interestingly, in one genetic background the transgenic Lr34-based resistance resulted in improved seedling resistance without cold treatment. These data indicate that functional variability in Lr34-based resistance can be created using a transgenic approach."

"23184317","abstracttext","The dehydration responsive element binding (DREB) proteins are important transcription factors that contribute to stress endurance in plants triggering the expression of a set of abiotic stress-related genes. A DREB2-related gene, previously referred to as dehydration responsive factor 1 (DRF1) was originally isolated and characterized in durum wheat. The aim of this study was to monitor the expression profiles of three alternatively spliced TdDRF1 transcripts during dehydration experiments and to evaluate the effects of genetic diversity on the molecular response, using experimental conditions reflecting as closely as possible water stress perceived by cereals in open field. To investigate the effect of moderate water stress conditions, time-course dehydration experiments were carried out under controlled conditions in the greenhouse on four durum wheat and one triticale genotypes. Differences were observed in molecular patterns, thus, suggesting a genotype dependency of the DRF1 gene expression in response to the stress induced. The biodiversity of the transcripts of the DRF1 gene was explored in order to assess the level of polymorphism and its possible effects on structure and function of putative proteins. A total of nine haplotypes were identified in the sequences cloned, seven of which encompassing polymorphisms in exon 4, including the region codifying for the DNA binding Apetala2 (AP2) domain. The 3D structural models of the AP2 domain were generated by homology modelling using the variability observed. The polymorphisms analysed did not significantly affect the structural arrangement of the DNA binding domains, thus resulting compatible with the putative functionality."

"23648486","abstracttext","Wheat scab, caused by the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum is a devastating disease worldwide. Despite an extensive and coordinated effort to investigate this pathosystem, little progress has been made to understand the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions, for example how the pathogen causes disease in plant. Recently, a secreted lipase (FGL1) has been identified from the fungus and shown to be an important virulence factor; however, the intrinsic function of FGL1 in plant is unknown. Here, we report the identification of the molecular components that may possibly be involved in the FGL virulence pathway using yeast two hybrid system. FGL gene was amplified from a local virulent strain (F15) and shown to be 99.5% identical to the original published FGL at the amino acid level. We showed that transient expression of this FGL gene by Agroinfiltration in tobacco leaves causes cell death further implicating the role of FGL in virulence. To identify FGL initial physical target in plant, we screened two wheat cDNA libraries using the FGL protein as the bait. From both libraries, a small FKBP-type immunophilin protein, designated wFKBP12, was found to physically interact with FGL. The direct interaction of FGL with wFKBP12 was confirmed in living onion epidermal cells by biomolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. To investigate further, we then used wFKBP12 protein as bait and identified an elicitor-responsive protein that contains a potential Ca(2+) binding domain. Semi-quantitative PCR showed that this elicitor-responsive gene is down-regulated during the F. graminearum infection suggesting that this protein may be an important component in FGL virulence pathway. This work serves as an initial step to reveal how fungal lipases act as a general virulence factor."

"23588419","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in seed dormancy and transcriptional regulation of genes coding for ABA biosynthetic and degradation enzymes is responsible for control of ABA content. However, little is known about signalling both before and after ABA regulation, in particular, how environmental signals are perceived and transduced. We are interested in these processes in cereal grains, particularly in relation to the development of strategies for controlling pre-harvest sprouting in barley and wheat. Our previous studies have indicated possible components of dormancy control and here we present evidence that blue light, nitric oxide (NO) and jasmonate are major controlling elements in wheat grain. Using microarray and pharmacological studies, we have found that blue light inhibits germination in dormant grain and that methyl jasmonate (MJ) and NO counteract this effect by reducing dormancy. We also present evidence that NO and jasmonate play roles in dormancy control in vivo. ABA was reduced by MJ and this was accompanied by reduced levels of expression of TaNCED1 and increased expression of TaABA8'OH-1 compared with dormant grain. Similar changes were caused by after-ripening. Analysis of global gene expression showed that although jasmonate and after-ripening caused important changes in gene expression, the changes were very different. While breaking dormancy, MJ had only a small number of target genes including gene(s) encoding beta-glucosidase. Our evidence indicates that NO and MJ act interdependently in controlling reduction of ABA and thus the demise of dormancy."

"23676088","abstracttext","To elucidate genetic mechanisms of host species specificity between graminicolous anthracnose fungi and gramineous plants, infection assays were performed with a Sorghum isolate (Colletotrichum sublineolum), a Digitaria isolate (C. hanaui), a Polypogon isolate (C. cereale), and an Avena isolate (C. cereale). They were specifically virulent on the plants from which they were isolated. When 72 wheat lines were inoculated with an unadapted isolate from Asia Minor bluegrass (Cgp29), however, some exceptional cultivars were recognized. Although most cultivars were resistant to Cgp29, 'Hope' was susceptible. In F2 populations derived from crosses between three resistant cultivars-'Norin 4' (N4), 'Chinese Spring' (CS), and 'Shin-chunaga' (Sch)-and the susceptible Hope, resistant and susceptible seedlings segregated in a 3:1 ratio, suggesting that a major gene is involved in the resistance of each cultivar to Cgp29. In F2 populations derived from crosses between the three resistant cultivars, all seedlings were resistant, suggesting that these three cultivars carry the same gene. This resistance gene was designated as ""resistance to Colletotrichum cereale 1"" (Rcc1). Analysis with the CS-Hope chromosome substitution lines and molecular mapping revealed that Rcc1 was located on the long arm of chromosome 5A. Cytologically, Rcc1 was mainly associated with hypersensitive reaction. These results suggest that major genes similar to those controlling cultivar specificity are involved in the resistance of wheat against the unadapted isolate of C. cereale."

"24065539","abstracttext","The non-protein-coding genes have been reported as a critical control role in the regulation of gene expression in abiotic stress. We previously identified four expressed sequence tags numbered S18 (EL773024), S73 (EL773035), S106 (EL773041) and S108 (EL773042) from a SSH-cDNA library of bread wheat Shaanmai 139 infected with Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Here, we isolated four cDNA clones and referred them as TalncRNA18, TalncRNA73, TalncRNA106 and TalncRNA108 (GenBank: KC549675-KC549678). These cDNA separately consisted of 1,393, 667, 449 and 647 nucleotides but without any open reading frame. The alignment result showed that TalncRNA18 is a partial cDNA of E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UPL1-like gene, TalncRNA73 is an antisense transcript of hypothetical protein, TalncRNA108 is a homolog to RRNA intron-encoded homing endonuclease, and lncRNA106 had no similarly sequence. Quantitative RT-PCR studies confirmed that these four lncRNAs were differentially expressed in three near isogenic lines. TalncRNA108 was significantly stepwise decreased at early stage of inoculation with Pst, while the others were upregulated, especially at 1 and 3 dpi (days post-inoculation). Using Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines and its ditelosomic lines, TalncRNA73 and TalncRNA108 were located to wheat chromosome 7A and the short arm of chromosome 4B, respectively, while TalncRNA18 and TalncRNA106 were located to chromosome 5B. Comparing the sequence of DNA and cDNA of four lncRNAs with polymerase chain reaction primers, the results showed that all of them have no introns. The kinetics analyses of lncRNAs expression as a result of pathogen challenge in immune resistant genotype indicated that they may play the roles of modulating or silencing the protein-coding gene into pathogen-defence response."

"25225496","articletitle","Diversifying selection in the wheat stem rust fungus acts predominantly on pathogen-associated gene families and reveals candidate effectors."
"25225496","abstracttext","Plant pathogens cause severe losses to crop plants and threaten global food production. One striking example is the wheat stem rust fungus, Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, which can rapidly evolve new virulent pathotypes in response to resistant host lines. Like several other filamentous fungal and oomycete plant pathogens, its genome features expanded gene families that have been implicated in host-pathogen interactions, possibly encoding effector proteins that interact directly with target host defense proteins. Previous efforts to understand virulence largely relied on the prediction of secreted, small and cysteine-rich proteins as candidate effectors and thus delivered an overwhelming number of candidates. Here, we implement an alternative analysis strategy that uses the signal of adaptive evolution as a line of evidence for effector function, combined with comparative information and expression data. We demonstrate that in planta up-regulated genes that are rapidly evolving are found almost exclusively in pathogen-associated gene families, affirming the impact of host-pathogen co-evolution on genome structure and the adaptive diversification of specialized gene families. In particular, we predict 42 effector candidates that are conserved only across pathogens, induced during infection and rapidly evolving. One of our top candidates has recently been shown to induce genotype-specific hypersensitive cell death in wheat. This shows that comparative genomics incorporating the evolutionary signal of adaptation is powerful for predicting effector candidates for laboratory verification. Our system can be applied to a wide range of pathogens and will give insight into host-pathogen dynamics, ultimately leading to progress in strategies for disease control."

"25656150","abstracttext_key message","This work laid the foundation for cloning of shattering gene Br2 and provided first line of evidence that two major Aegilops tauschii lineages are differentiated by an inversion polymorphism. Chromosome inversions often accompany population differentiation and capture local adaptation during speciation. Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor species of hexaploid wheat, consists of two genetically isolated lineages, L1 and L2, but little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying the population differentiation in this diploid species. During fine mapping of the shattering gene Br2 using a large F2 population derived from a cross between TA1604 (an L1 accession) and AL8/78 (an L2 accession), we found contrasting patterns of crossover distribution in the Br2 interval and neighboring regions despite the high local gene synteny with Brachypodium distachyon and rice. Br2 was localized in a 0.08-cM interval, and 13 marker loci formed a block, where single-crossovers were completely suppressed, but double-crossovers were enriched with a recombination rate of ~11 cM/Mb. In contrast, in a neighboring region no double-crossover was recovered, but single-crossover rate reached 24 cM/Mb, which is much higher than the genome-wide average. This result suggests a putative inversion polymorphism between the parental lines in the Br2 region. Genotyping using the markers from the Br2 region divided a collection of 55 randomly sampled A. tauschii accessions into two major groups, and they are largely genetically isolated. The two groups correspond to the L1 and L2 lineages based on their geographic distribution patterns. This provides first evidence that inversions may underlie the evolution of A. tauschii lineages. The presence of inter-lineage inversions may complicate map-based cloning in A. tauschii and transfer of useful traits to wheat."

Molecular characterization of TaHDZipI-2 protein included studies of its dimerisation, protein-DNA interactions and gene activation properties using pull-down assays, in-yeast methods and transient expression assays in wheat cells. The analysis of TaHDZipI-2 gene functions was performed using transgenic barley plants. It included comparison of developmental phenotypes, yield components, grain quality, frost tolerance and the levels of expression of potential target genes in transgenic and control plants. Transgenic TaHDZipI-2 lines showed characteristic phenotypic features that included reduced growth rates, reduced biomass, early flowering, light-coloured leaves and narrowly elongated spikes. Transgenic lines produced 25-40% more seeds per spike than control plants, but with 50-60% smaller grain size. In vivo lipid imaging exposed changes in the distribution of lipids between the embryo and endosperm in transgenic seeds. Transgenic lines were significantly more tolerant to frost than control plants. Our data suggest the role of TaHDZipI-2 in controlling several key processes underlying frost tolerance, transition to flowering and spike development."

"27442533","abstracttext","Parastagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing Septoria nodorum blotch on wheat. We have identified nine necrotrophic effector-host dominant sensitivity gene interactions, and we have cloned three of the necrotrophic effector genes, including SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3. Because sexual populations of P. nodorum are difficult to develop under lab conditions, genome-wide association study (GWAS) is the best population genomic approach to identify genomic regions associated with traits using natural populations. In this article, we used a global collection of 191 P. nodorum isolates from which we identified 2,983 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and gene markers for SnToxA and SnTox3 to evaluate the power of GWAS on two popular wheat breeding lines that were sensitive to SnToxA and SnTox3. Strong marker trait associations (MTA) with P. nodorum virulence that mapped to SnTox3 and SnToxA were first identified using the marker set described above. A novel locus in the P. nodorum genome associated with virulence was also identified as a result of this analysis. To evaluate whether a sufficient level of marker saturation was available, we designed a set of primers every 1 kb in the genomic regions containing SnToxA and SnTox3. Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed across the 191 isolates and the presence/absence polymorphism was scored and used as the genotype. The marker proximity necessary to identify MTA flanking SnToxA and SnTox3 ranged from 4 to 5 and 1 to 7 kb, respectively. Similar analysis was performed on the novel locus. Using a 45% missing data threshold, two more SNP were identified spanning a 4.6-kb genomic region at the novel locus. These results showed that the rate of linkage disequilibrium (LD) decay in P. nodorum and, likely, other fungi is high compared with plants and animals. The fast LD decay in P. nodorum is an advantage only if sufficient marker density is attained. Based on our results with the SnToxA and SnTox3 regions, markers are needed every 9 or 8 kb, respectively, or in every gene, to guarantee that genes associated with a quantitative trait such as virulence are not missed."

"27309724","abstracttext","Stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis (Pgt), is a damaging disease of wheat that can be controlled by utilizing effective stem rust resistance genes. 'Thatcher' wheat carries complex resistance to stem rust that is enhanced in the presence of the resistance gene Lr34. The purpose of this study was to examine APR in 'Thatcher' and look for genetic interactions with Lr34. A RIL population was tested for stem rust resistance in field nurseries in Canada, USA, and Kenya. BSA was used to find SNP markers associated with reduced stem rust severity. A major QTL was identified on chromosome 3BL near the centromere in all environments. Seedling testing showed that Sr12 mapped to the same region as the QTL for APR. The SNP markers were physically mapped and the region carrying the resistance was searched for sequences with homology to members of the NB-LRR resistance gene family. SNP marker from one NB-LRR-like sequence, NB-LRR3 co-segregated with Sr12. Two additional populations, including one that lacked Lr34, were tested in field nurseries. NB-LRR3 mapped near the maximum LOD for reduction in stem rust severity in both populations. Lines from a population that segregated for Sr12 and Lr34 were tested for seedling Pgt biomass and infection type, as well as APR to field stem rust which showed an interaction between the genes. We concluded that Sr12, or a gene closely linked to Sr12, was responsible for 'Thatcher'-derived APR in several environments and this resistance was enhanced in the presence of Lr34."
"27503371","articletitle","Effectors from Wheat Rust Fungi Suppress Multiple Plant Defense Responses."
"27503371","abstracttext","Fungi that cause cereal rust diseases (genus Puccinia) are important pathogens of wheat globally. Upon infection, the fungus secretes a number of effector proteins. Although a large repository of putative effectors has been predicted using bioinformatic pipelines, the lack of available high-throughput effector screening systems has limited functional studies on these proteins. In this study, we mined the available transcriptomes of Puccinia graminis and P. striiformis to look for potential effectors that suppress host hypersensitive response (HR). Twenty small (<300 amino acids), secreted proteins, with no predicted functions were selected for the HR suppression assay using Nicotiana benthamiana, in which each of the proteins were transiently expressed and evaluated for their ability to suppress HR caused by four cytotoxic effector-R gene combinations (Cp/Rx, ATR13/RPP13, Rpt2/RPS-2, and GPA/RBP-1) and one mutated R gene-Pto(Y207D). Nine out of twenty proteins, designated Shr1 to Shr9 (suppressors of hypersensitive response), were found to suppress HR in N. benthamiana. These effectors varied in the effector-R gene defenses they suppressed, indicating these pathogens can interfere with a variety of host defense pathways. In addition to HR suppression, effector Shr7 also suppressed PAMP-triggered immune response triggered by flg22. Finally, delivery of Shr7 through Pseudomonas fluorescens EtHAn suppressed nonspecific HR induced by Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 in wheat, confirming its activity in a homologous system. Overall, this study provides the first evidence for the presence of effectors in Puccinia species suppressing multiple plant defense responses."
"28710879","articletitle","The transcription factor PstSTE12 is required for virulence of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici."
"28710879","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) is an obligate biotrophic fungus that causes extensive damage in wheat. The pathogen is now known to be a heteroecious fungus with an intricate life cycle containing sexual and asexual stages. Orthologues of the STE12 transcription factor that regulate mating and filamentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as virulence in other fungi, have been extensively described. Because reliable transformation and gene disruption methods are lacking for Pst, knowledge about the function of its STE12 orthologue is limited. In this study, we identified a putative orthologue of STE12 from Pst in haustoria-enriched transcripts and designated it as PstSTE12. The gene encodes a protein of 879 amino acids containing three helices in the homeodomain, conserved phenylalanine and tryptophan sites, and two C 2 /H 2 -Zn 2+ finger domains. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses revealed that the expression of PstSTE12 was highly induced during the early infection stages and peaked during haustorium formation and the pycniospore stage in the aecial host barberry. Subcellular localization assays indicated that PstSTE12 is localized in the nucleus and functions as a transcriptional activator. Yeast one-hybrid assays revealed that PstSTE12 exhibits transcriptional activity, and that its C-terminus is necessary for the activation of transcription. PstSTE12 complemented the mating defect in an α ste12 mutant of S. cerevisiae. In addition, it partially complemented the defects of the Magnaporthe oryzae mst12 mutant in plant infection. Knocking down PstSTE12 via host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) mediated by Barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) resulted in a substantial reduction in the growth and spread of hyphae in Pst and weakened the virulence of Pst on wheat. Our results suggest that PstSTE12 probably acts at an intersection participating in the invasion and mating processes of Pst, and provide new insights into the comprehension of the variation of virulence in cereal rust fungi."

"28403814","abstracttext_background","Two opposing evolutionary constraints exert pressure on plant pathogens: one to diversify virulence factors in order to evade plant defenses, and the other to retain virulence factors critical for maintaining a compatible interaction with the plant host. To better understand how the diversified arsenals of fungal genes promote interaction with the same compatible wheat line, we performed a comparative genomic analysis of two North American isolates of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt)."
"28403814","abstracttext_results","The patterns of inter-isolate divergence in the secreted candidate effector genes were compared with the levels of conservation and divergence of plant-pathogen gene co-expression networks (GCN) developed for each isolate. Comprative genomic analyses revealed substantial level of interisolate divergence in effector gene complement and sequence divergence. Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of the conserved and unique parts of the isolate-specific GCNs identified a number of conserved host pathways targeted by both isolates. Interestingly, the degree of inter-isolate sub-network conservation varied widely for the different host pathways and was positively associated with the proportion of conserved effector candidates associated with each sub-network. While different Pgt isolates tended to exploit similar wheat pathways for infection, the mode of plant-pathogen interaction varied for different pathways with some pathways being associated with the conserved set of effectors and others being linked with the diverged or isolate-specific effectors."
"28403814","abstracttext_conclusions","Our data suggest that at the intra-species level pathogen populations likely maintain divergent sets of effectors capable of targeting the same plant host pathways. This functional redundancy may play an important role in the dynamic of the ""arms-race"" between host and pathogen serving as the basis for diverse virulence strategies and creating conditions where mutations in certain effector groups will not have a major effect on the pathogen's ability to infect the host."
"27559339","articletitle","Carotenoids in Staple Cereals: Metabolism, Regulation, and Genetic Manipulation."
"27559339","abstracttext","Carotenoids play a critical role in animal and human health. Animals and humans are unable to synthesize carotenoids de novo, and therefore rely upon diet as sources of these compounds. However, major staple cereals often contain only small amounts of carotenoids in their grains. Consequently, there is considerable interest in genetic manipulation of carotenoid content in cereal grain. In this review, we focus on carotenoid metabolism and regulation in non-green plant tissues, as well as genetic manipulation in staple cereals such as rice, maize, and wheat. Significant progress has been made in three aspects: (1) seven carotenogenes play vital roles in carotenoid regulation in non-green plant tissues, including 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase influencing isoprenoid precursor supply, phytoene synthase, β-cyclase, and ε-cyclase controlling biosynthesis, 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2-(E)-butenyl 4-diphosphate reductase and carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases responsible for degradation, and orange gene conditioning sequestration sink; (2) provitamin A-biofortified crops, such as rice and maize, were developed by either metabolic engineering or marker-assisted breeding; (3) quantitative trait loci for carotenoid content on chromosomes 3B, 7A, and 7B were consistently identified, eight carotenogenes including 23 loci were detected, and 10 gene-specific markers for carotenoid accumulation were developed and applied in wheat improvement. A comprehensive and deeper understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of carotenoid metabolism in crops will be beneficial in improving our precision in improving carotenoid contents. Genomic selection and gene editing are emerging as transformative technologies for provitamin A biofortification."

"27788144","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the major causal agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in barley and wheat in North America. The fungus not only causes yield loss of the crops but also produces harmful trichothecene mycotoxins [Deoxynivalenol (DON) and its derivatives-3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3ADON) and 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15ADON), and nivalenol (NIV)] that contaminate grains. Previous studies showed a dramatic increase of 3ADON-producing isolates with higher aggressiveness and DON production than the 15ADON-producing isolates in North America. However, the genetic and molecular basis of differences between the two types of isolates is unclear. In this study, we compared transcriptomes of the 3ADON and 15ADON isolates in vitro (in culture media) and in planta (during infection on the susceptible wheat cultivar 'Briggs') using RNA-sequencing. The in vitro gene expression comparison identified 479 up-regulated and 801 down-regulated genes in the 3ADON isolates; the up-regulated genes were mainly involved in C-compound and carbohydrate metabolism (18.6%), polysaccharide metabolism (7.7%) or were of unknown functions (57.6%). The in planta gene expression analysis revealed that 185, 89, and 62 genes were up-regulated in the 3ADON population at 48, 96, and 144 hours after inoculation (HAI), respectively. The up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in functions for cellular import, C-compound and carbohydrate metabolism, allantoin and allantoate transport at 48 HAI, for detoxification and virulence at 96 HAI, and for metabolism of acetic acid derivatives, detoxification, and cellular import at 144 HAI. Comparative analyses of in planta versus in vitro gene expression further revealed 2,159, 1,981 and 2,095 genes up-regulated in the 3ADON isolates, and 2,415, 2,059 and 1,777 genes up-regulated in the 15ADON isolates at the three time points after inoculation. Collectively, our data provides a foundation for further understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in aggressiveness and DON production of the two chemotype isolates of F. graminearum."

"29329218","abstracttext","We intended to assess how exposure of piglets to deoxynivalenol (DON)-contaminated feed impacted their growth, immune response and gut development. Piglets were fed traditional Phase I, Phase II and Phase III diets with the control group receiving 0.20-0.40 ppm DON (referred to as the Control group) and treatment group receiving much higher level of DON-contaminated wheat (3.30-3.80 ppm; referred to as DON-contaminated group). Feeding a DON-contaminated diet had no impact on average daily feed intake (ADFI) ( p < 0.08) or average daily gain (ADG) ( p > 0.10) but it did significantly reduce body weight over time relative to the control piglets ( p < 0.05). Cytokine analysis after initial exposure to the DON-contaminated feed did not result in significant differences in serum interleukin (IL) IL1β, IL-8, IL-13, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or interferon (IFN)-γ. After day 24, no obvious changes in jejunum or ileum gut morphology, histology or changes in gene expression for IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNFα, or Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4 genes. IL-8 showed a trend towards increased expression in the ileum in DON-fed piglets. A significant increase in gene expression for claudin (CLDN) 7 gene expression and a trend towards increased CLDN 2-expression was observed in the ileum in piglets fed the highly DON-contaminated wheat. Because CLDN localization was not negatively affected, we believe that it is unlikely that gut permeability was affected. Exposure to DON-contaminated feed did not significantly impact weaner piglet performance or gut physiology."

"28288640","abstracttext_background","C 4 -dicarboxylic acids, including malic acid, fumaric acid and succinic acid, are valuable organic acids that can be produced and secreted by a number of microorganisms. Previous studies on organic acid production by Aspergillus carbonarius, which is capable of producing high amounts of citric acid from varieties carbon sources, have revealed its potential as a fungal cell factory. Earlier attempts to reroute citric acid production into C 4 -dicarboxylic acids have been with limited success."
"28288640","abstracttext_results","In this study, a glucose oxidase deficient strain of A. carbonarius was used as the parental strain to overexpress a native C 4 -dicarboxylate transporter and the gene frd encoding fumarate reductase from Trypanosoma brucei individually and in combination. Impacts of the introduced genetic modifications on organic acid production were investigated in a defined medium and in a hydrolysate of wheat straw containing high concentrations of glucose and xylose. In the defined medium, overexpression of the C 4 -dicarboxylate transporter alone and in combination with the frd gene significantly increased the production of C 4 -dicarboxylic acids and reduced the accumulation of citric acid, whereas expression of the frd gene alone did not result in any significant change of organic acid production profile. In the wheat straw hydrolysate after 9 days of cultivation, similar results were obtained as in the defined medium. High amounts of malic acid and succinic acid were produced by the same strains."

"29136531","abstracttext","This 2-year study aimed to verify whether the continuous application of no tillage (NT) for over 20years, in comparison with conventional tillage (CT), affects nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and ammonia (NH 3 ) emissions from a Vertisol and, if so, whether such an effect varies with crop sequence (continuous wheat, WW and wheat after faba bean, FW). To shed light on the mechanisms involved in determining N-gas emissions, soil bulk density, water filled pore space (WFPS), some carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) pools, denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA), and nitrous oxide reductase gene abundance (nosZ gene) were also assessed at 0-15 and 15-30cm soil depth. Tillage system had no significant effect on total NH 3 emissions. On average, total N 2 O emissions were higher under NT (2.45kgN 2 O-Nha -1 ) than CT (1.72kgN 2 O-Nha -1 ), being the differences between the two tillage systems greater in FW than WW. The higher N 2 O emissions in NT treatments were ascribed to the increased bulk density, WFPS, and extractable organic C under NT compared to CT, all factors that generally promote the production of N 2 O. Moreover, compared to CT, NT enhanced the potential DEA (114 vs 16μgNkg -1 h -1 ) and nosZ gene abundance (116 vs 69 copy number mg -1 dry soil) in the topsoil. Finally, NT compared to CT led to an average annual increase in C stock of 0.70MgCha -1 year -1 . Though NT can increase the amount os soil organic matter so storing CO 2 into soil, some criticisms related to the increase of N 2 O emission arise, thereby suggesting the need for defining management strategies to mitigate such a negative effect."

"29616395","abstracttext_main conclusion","TaGF14b enhances tolerance to multiple stresses through ABA signaling pathway by altering physiological and biochemical processes, including ROS-scavenging system, stomatal closure, compatible osmolytes, and stress-related gene expressions in tobaccos. The 14-3-3 proteins are involved in plant growth, development, and in responding to abiotic stresses. However, the precise functions of 14-3-3s in responding to drought and salt stresses remained unclear, especially in wheat. In this study, a 14-3-3 gene from wheat, designated TaGF14b, was cloned and characterized. TaGF14b was upregulated by polyethylene glycol 6000, sodium chloride, hydrogen peroxide, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments. Ectopic expression of TaGF14b in tobacco conferred enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses. Transgenic tobaccos had longer root, better growth status, and higher relative water content, survival rate, photosynthetic rate, and water use efficiency than control plants under drought and salt stresses. The contribution of TaGF14b to drought and salt tolerance relies on the regulations of ABA biosynthesis and ABA signaling, as well as stomatal closure and stress-related gene expressions. Moreover, TaGF14b expression could significantly enhance the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system to ameliorate oxidative damage to cells. In addition, TaGF14b increased tolerance to osmotic stress evoked by drought and salinity through modifying water conservation and compatible osmolytes in plants. In conclusion, TaGF14b enhances tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses through the ABA signaling pathway in transgenic tobaccos by altering physiological and biochemical processes."

"29564697","abstracttext_key message","The understanding of roles of bZIP factors in biological processes during plant development and under abiotic stresses requires the detailed mechanistic knowledge of behaviour of TFs. Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) play key roles in the regulation of grain development and plant responses to abiotic stresses. We investigated the role and molecular mechanisms of function of the TabZIP2 gene isolated from drought-stressed wheat plants. Molecular characterisation of TabZIP2 and derived protein included analyses of gene expression and its target promoter, and the influence of interacting partners on the target promoter activation. Two interacting partners of TabZIP2, the 14-3-3 protein, TaWIN1 and the bZIP transcription factor TaABI5L, were identified in a Y2H screen. We established that under elevated ABA levels the activity of TabZIP2 was negatively regulated by the TaWIN1 protein and positively regulated by the SnRK3/CIPK protein kinase WPK4, reported previously to be responsive to nutrient starvation. The physical interaction between the TaWIN1 and the WPK4 was detected. We also compared the influence of homo- and hetero-dimerisation of TabZIP2 and TaABI5L on DNA binding. TabZIP2 gene functional analyses were performed using drought-inducible overexpression of TabZIP2 in transgenic wheat. Transgenic plants grown under moderate drought during flowering, were smaller than control plants, and had fewer spikes and seeds per plant. However, a single seed weight was increased compared to single seed weights of control plants in three of four evaluated transgenic lines. The observed phenotypes of transgenic plants and the regulation of TabZIP2 activity by nutrient starvation-responsive WPK4, suggest that the TabZIP2 could be the part of a signalling pathway, which controls the rearrangement of carbohydrate and nutrient flows in plant organs in response to drought."

"29948458","abstracttext","Nitrogen is an essential macronutrient for plant growth and reproduction. In durum wheat, an appropriate nitrogen soil availability is essential for an optimal seed development. miRNAs contribute to the environmental change adaptation of plants through the regulation of important genes involved in stress processes. In this work, nitrogen stress response was evaluated in durum wheat seedlings of Ciccio and Svevo cultivars. Eight small RNA libraries from leaves and roots of chronically stressed plants were sequenced to detect conserved and novel miRNAs. A total of 294 miRNAs were identified, 7 of which were described here for the first time. The expression level of selected miRNAs and target genes was analyzed by qPCR in seedlings subjected to chronic (Ciccio and Svevo, leaves and roots) or short-term (Svevo roots) stress conditions. Some miRNAs showed an immediate stress response, and their level of expression was either maintained or returned to a basal level during a long-term stress. Other miRNAs showed a gradual up- or downregulation during the short-term stress. The newly identified miRNA ttu-novel-106 showed an immediate strongly downregulation after nitrogen stress, which was negatively correlated with the expression of MYB-A, its putative target gene. PHO2 gene was significantly upregulated after 24-48-h stress, corresponding to a downregulation of miR399b. Ttu-miR399b putative binding sites in the 5' UTR region of the Svevo PHO2 gene were identified in the A and B genomes. Both MYB-A and PHO2 genes were validated for their cleavage site using 5' RACE assay."

"32681381","abstracttext","The production of wheat is severely affected by abiotic stresses such as cold, drought, salinity, and high temperature. Although constitutive promoters are frequently used to regulate the expression of alien genes, these may lead to undesirable side-effects in transgenic plants. Therefore, identification and characterization of an inducible promoter that can express transgene only when exposed to stresses are of great importance in the genetic engineering of crop plants. Previous studies have indicated the abiotic stress-responsive behavior of myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) gene in different plants. Here, we isolated the MIOX gene promoter from wheat (TaMIOX). The in-silico analysis revealed the presence of various abiotic stress-responsive cis-elements in the promoter region. The TaMIOX promoter was fused with the UidA reporter gene and transformed into Arabidopsis thaliana. The T 3 single-copy homozygous lines were analyzed for GUS activity using histochemical and fluorometric assays. Transcript expression of TaMIOX::UidA was significantly up-regulated by heat (five fold), cold (seven fold), and drought (five fold) stresses as compared to transgenic plants grown without stress-induced conditions. The CaMV35S::UidA plants showed very high GUS activity even in normal conditions. In contrast, the TaMIOX::UidA plants showed prominent GUS activity only in stress treatments (cold, heat, and drought), which suggests the inducible behavior of the TaMIOX promoter. The substrate myo-inositol feeding assay of TaMIOX::UidA plants showed lesser GUS activity as compared to plants treated in abiotic stress conditions. Results support that the TaMIOX promoter could be used as a potential candidate for conditional expression of the transgene in abiotic stress conditions."

"32481078","abstracttext","WRKY proteins are a large family of plant-specific transcription factors associated with regulation of biotic and abiotic stress responses, but how they respond to cereal rust pathogens has never been explored at the molecular level. Full-length cDNA of TaWRKY1B was obtained from a wheat cultivar HD2329 derivative containing leaf rust resistance gene Lr28 based on domain characteristics. The unique feature of this WRKY transcription factor gene was the close proximity of the DNA-binding domain and consensus DNA element W-Box within the open reading frame. Infection with a virulent race of leaf rust fungus resulted in 146-fold induction of the gene in resistant plants, but only 12-fold in the susceptible plants as compared with mock-inoculated controls. Docking models of 74 amino acids DNA-binding domain and 26bp W-Box element showed that the WRKY domain, located on the β1 strand, only interacts with the W-Box at positions corresponding to W125, R126, K127 and Y128 amino acids. A truncated recombinant protein of 9.0 kD, encompassing the DNA-binding domain also showed binding specificity to the 32bp W-Box element in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. The protein-DNA ensemble was also characterised using high-resolution atomic force microscopic imaging. The results contribute to an understanding of the molecular structure and function of a previously uncharacterised WRKY transcription factor in wheat that can be manipulated to improve biotic stress tolerance."

"32220847","abstracttext","Drought is among the most destructive abiotic stresses limiting crop growth and yield worldwide. Although most research has focused on the contribution of plant-associated microbial communities to plant growth and disease suppression, far less is known about the microbes involved in drought resistance among desert plants. In the present study, we applied 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to determine the structure of rhizosphere and root endosphere microbiomes of Alhagi sparsifolia Compared to those of the rhizosphere, endosphere microbiomes had lower diversity but contained several taxa with higher relative abundance; many of these taxa were also present in the roots of other desert plants. We isolated a Pseudomonas strain (LTGT-11-2Z) that was prevalent in root endosphere microbiomes of A. sparsifolia and promoted drought resistance during incubation with wheat. Complete genome sequencing of LTGT-11-2Z revealed 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate deaminases, siderophore, spermidine, and colanic acid biosynthetic genes, as well as type VI secretion system (T6SS) genes, which are likely involved in biofilm formation and plant-microbe interactions. Together, these results indicate that drought-enduring plants harbor bacterial endophytes favorable to plant drought resistance, and they suggest that novel endophytic bacterial taxa and gene resources may be discovered among these desert plants. IMPORTANCE Understanding microbe-mediated plant resistance to drought is important for sustainable agriculture. We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and culture-dependent functional analyses of Alhagi sparsifolia rhizosphere and root endosphere microbiomes and identified key endophytic bacterial taxa and their genes facilitating drought resistance in wheat. This study improves our understanding of plant drought resistance and provides new avenues for drought resistance improvement in crop plants under field conditions."

"31401779","abstracttext","Sunflower (Helianthus annuus. L) is one of the principal oil seed crops affected by the salinity stress, which limits the oil content and crop yield of sunflower plants. The acclimatization of plants to abiotic stresses such as salinity tolerance is mainly mediated by the vacuolar Na + /H + antiporters (NHX) by tagging Na + into vacuoles from the cytosol. We show here that the over-expression of wheat TaNHX2 gene in transgenic sunflower conferred improved salinity stress tolerance and growth performance. Transgenic sunflower plants were produced by infecting the embryonic axis ex-plants with Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 containing a pBin438-TaNHX2 binary vector that carried a wheat antiporter (TaNHX2) gene under the control of a double CaMV 35S promoter with NPT II gene as a selectable marker. PCR analysis of T 0 and T 1 transgenic plants confirmed the integration of TaNHX2 in sunflower genome. Stable integration and expression of TaNHX2 in sunflower genome was further verified by Southern hybridization and semi-quantitative RT-PCR analyses. As compared to the non-transformed plants, TaNHX2 expressing transgenic plants showed better growth performance and accumulated higher Na + , K + contents in leaves and roots under salt stress (200 mM NaCl). Transgenic sunflower plants displayed improved protection against cell damage exhibiting stable relative water content, chlorophyll content, increased proline accumulation and improved reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging because of higher activities of the antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase and ascorbate peroxidase, along with decreased production of hydrogen peroxide, free oxygen radical and malondialdehyde (MDA) under salt stress (200 mM NaCl). Taken together, our findings suggest that TaNHX2 expression in sunflower plants contributed towards improving growth performance under sodium chloride stress."

To avoid interference of Pm3e in APR studies, line 6037 that lacked Pm3e but showed field resistance from doubled-haploid (DH) population Atlantis/Cortez was used in two backcrosses to Atlantis for the establishment of DH population 6037/Atlantis//Atlantis. APR was assessed in the greenhouse 10, 15, and 20 days after inoculation (dai) from the 4-leaf stage onwards and combined with single-nucleotide polymorphism data in a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a linkage map-based quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. In GWAS, two QTL were detected: one on chromosome 1BL 10 dai, the other on chromosome 2BL 20 dai. In conventional QTL analysis, both QTL were detected with all three disease ratings: the QTL on chromosome 1BL explained a maximum of 35.2% of the phenotypic variation 10 dai, whereas the QTL on chromosome 2BL explained a maximum of 43.5% of the phenotypic variation 20 dai. Compared with GWAS, linkage map-based QTL analysis allowed following the dynamics of QTL action. The two large-effect QTL for APR to powdery mildew with dynamic gene action can be useful for the enhancement of wheat germplasm."

"33001778","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB) of wheat, caused by Parastagonospora nodorum , is managed using cultural practices, resistant varieties, and foliar fungicides. Frequent fungicide use can select for fungicide resistance, making certain chemistries less effective; this may in part explain increasing severity of SNB in the mid-Atlantic U.S. Quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) resistance has been documented for a diversity of fungi, but it has not been reported for P. nodorum in the U.S. The objectives of this study were to 1) evaluate QoI sensitivity of P. nodorum from Virginia wheat fields, 2) screen P. nodorum for QoI target site mutations in the cytochrome b gene, and 3) develop a molecular assay to detect target site mutations associated with QoI resistance. Sensitivity of 16 isolates to pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin was evaluated with radial growth assays, and the cytochrome b gene was sequenced. One isolate was insensitive to both fungicides, and it had the G143A mutation in the cytochrome b gene. For azoxystrobin, 10 isolates without target site mutations had reduced sensitivity. Additional isolates (N=74) were sequenced, and seven had the G143A mutation; all seven isolates with the mutation had reduced sensitivity to pyraclostrobin and azoxystrobin compared to a sensitive control isolate without the mutation. A pyrosequencing assay targeting G143A was developed as a rapid method to screen P. nodorum for the QoI resistance-conferring mutation. To our knowledge, this is the first report of QoI resistant P. nodorum in the U.S. Overall resistance frequency was low, but resistance management practices are needed to maintain the efficacy of fungicides for SNB control."

"32957933","abstracttext_background","Necrotrophic effector proteins secreted by fungal pathogens are important virulence factors that mediate the development of disease in wheat. Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Ptr), the causal agent of wheat tan spot, has a race structure dependent on the combination of effectors. In Ptr, ToxA and ToxB are known proteinaceous effectors responsible for necrosis and chlorosis respectively. While Ptr ToxA is encoded by the single gene ToxA, ToxB has multiple loci in the Ptr genome, which is postulated to be directly related to the level of ToxB production and leaf chlorosis. Although previous analysis has indicated that the majority of the ToxB loci lie on a single chromosome, the exact number and chromosomal locations for all the ToxB loci have not been fully identified."
"32957933","abstracttext_results","In this study, we have sequenced the genome of a race 5 ToxB-producing isolate (DW5), using PacBio long read technology, and found that ToxB duplications are nested in the complex subtelomeric chromosomal regions. A total of ten identical ToxB gene copies were identified and based on flanking sequence identity, nine loci appeared associated with chromosome 10 and a single copy with chromosome 5. Chromosome 10 multiple ToxB gene loci were separated by large sequence regions between 31 and 66 kb within larger segmental duplications in an alternating pattern related to loci strand, and flanked by transposable elements."

"32962020","articletitle","The Molecular and Functional Characterization of the Durum Wheat Lipoxygenase TdLOX2 Suggests Its Role in Hyperosmotic Stress Response."
"32962020","abstracttext","In plants, lipoxygenases (LOXs) are involved in various processes, such as growth, development, and response to stress cues. In the present study, the expression pattern of six durum wheat LOX-encoding genes ( TdLpx-B1.1 , TdLpx-B1.2 , TdLpx-A2 , TdLpx-B2 , TdLpx-A3 and TdLpx-B3 ) under hyperosmotic stress was investigated. With osmotic (0.42 M mannitol) and salt (0.21 M NaCl) stress imposed at the early stages of seedling growth, a strong induction of the TdLpx-A2 gene expression in the shoots paralleled an equally strong increase in the LOX activity. Enhanced levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased rates of superoxide anion generation were also observed as a result of the stress imposition. Sequence analysis of the TdLOX2 encoded by the TdLpx-A2 gene revealed that it belonged to the type-1 9-LOX group. When overexpressed in E. coli , TdLOX2 exhibited normal enzyme activity, high sensitivity to specific LOX inhibitors, with 76% and 99% inhibition by salicylhydroxamic and propyl gallate, respectively, and a preference for linoleic acid as substrate, which was converted exclusively to its corresponding 13-hydroperoxide. This unexpected positional specificity could be related to the unusual TV/K motif that in TdLOX2 replaces the canonical TV/R motif of 9-LOXs. Treatment of seedlings with propyl gallate strongly suppressed the increase in LOX activity induced by the hyperosmotic stress; the MDA accumulation was also reduced but less markedly, whereas the rate of superoxide anion generation was even more increased. Overall, our findings suggest that the up-regulation of the TdLpx-A2 gene is a component of the durum wheat response to hyperosmotic stress and that TdLOX2 may act by counteracting the excessive generation of harmful reactive oxygen species responsible for the oxidative damages that occur in plants under stress."

"25432969","abstracttext","Recent developments in DNA sequencing have enabled the large and complex genomes of many crop species to be determined for the first time, even those previously intractable due to their polyploid nature. Indeed, over the course of the last 2 years, the genome sequences of several commercially important cereals, notably barley and bread wheat, have become available, as well as those of related wild species. While still incomplete, comparison with other, more completely assembled species suggests that coverage of genic regions is likely to be high. Ensembl Plants (http://plants.ensembl.org) is an integrative resource organizing, analyzing and visualizing genome-scale information for important crop and model plants. Available data include reference genome sequence, variant loci, gene models and functional annotation. For variant loci, individual and population genotypes, linkage information and, where available, phenotypic information are shown. Comparative analyses are performed on DNA and protein sequence alignments. The resulting genome alignments and gene trees, representing the implied evolutionary history of the gene family, are made available for visualization and analysis. Driven by the case of bread wheat, specific extensions to the analysis pipelines and web interface have recently been developed to support polyploid genomes. Data in Ensembl Plants is accessible through a genome browser incorporating various specialist interfaces for different data types, and through a variety of additional methods for programmatic access and data mining. These interfaces are consistent with those offered through the Ensembl interface for the genomes of non-plant species, including those of plant pathogens, pests and pollinators, facilitating the study of the plant in its environment."

"31982860","abstracttext","In order to identify the genetic variations in root system architecture traits and their probable association with high- and low-affinity nitrate transport system, we performed several experiments on a genetically diverse set of wheat genotypes grown under two external nitrogen levels (optimum and limited nitrate conditions) at two growth points of the seedling stage. Further, we also examined the nitrate uptake and its transport under different combinations of nitrate availability in the external media using 15 N-labelled N-source ( 15 NO 3 - ), and gene expression pattern of different high- and low-affinity nitrate transporters. We observed that nitrate starvation invariably increases the total root size in all genotypes. However, the variation of component traits of total root size under nitrate starvation is genotype-specific at both stages. Further, we also observed genotypic variation in both nitrate uptake and translocation depending on the growth stage, external nitrate concentration and growing conditions. The expression of the TaNRT2.1 gene was invariably up-regulated under low external nitrate concentration; however, it gets reduced after a longer period (21 days) of starvation than the early stage (14 days). Among the four NRT1.1 orthologs, TaNPF6.3 and TaNPF6.4 consistently showed higher expression than TaNPF6.1 and TaNPF6.2 at higher nitrate concentration at both the growth stages. TaNPF6.3 and TaNPF6.4 apparently showed a feature of typical low-affinity nitrate transporter gene at higher external nitrate concentration at 14 and 21 days growth stages, respectively. The present study reveals the complex root system of wheat that has genotype-specific N-foraging along with highly coordinated high- and low-affinity nitrate transport systems for nitrate uptake and transport."
"32115909","articletitle","Salinity tolerance in barley during germination- homologs and potential genes."
"32115909","abstracttext","Salinity affects more than 6% of the world's total land area, causing massive losses in crop yield. Salinity inhibits plant growth and development through osmotic and ionic stresses; however, some plants exhibit adaptations through osmotic regulation, exclusion, and translocation of accumulated Na+ or Cl-. Currently, there are no practical, economically viable methods for managing salinity, so the best practice is to grow crops with improved tolerance. Germination is the stage in a plant's life cycle most adversely affected by salinity. Barley, the fourth most important cereal crop in the world, has outstanding salinity tolerance, relative to other cereal crops. Here, we review the genetics of salinity tolerance in barley during germination by summarizing reported quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and functional genes. The homologs of candidate genes for salinity tolerance in Arabidopsis, soybean, maize, wheat, and rice have been blasted and mapped on the barley reference genome. The genetic diversity of three reported functional gene families for salt tolerance during barley germination, namely dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) protein, somatic embryogenesis receptor-like kinase and aquaporin genes, is discussed. While all three gene families show great diversity in most plant species, the DREB gene family is more diverse in barley than in wheat and rice. Further to this review, a convenient method for screening for salinity tolerance at germination is needed, and the mechanisms of action of the genes involved in salt tolerance need to be identified, validated, and transferred to commercial cultivars for field production in saline soil."

"16328390","abstracttext","Diuraphis noxia (Russian wheat aphid, RWA) is a major pest on wheat in South Africa and most other wheat growing countries. Being a probing-sucking insect, RWAs insert their stylets into the phloem sieve elements and feed on the phloem sap. This feeding causes necrotic lesions in resistant varieties, or decoloration of leaves and death in susceptible varieties. In an effort to broaden our understanding on the response of the plant to RWA feeding, we synthesized and analyzed expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries. These libraries were constructed using near isogenic wheat lines susceptible ""Tugela"" and resistant ""TugelaDN"" (Dn1) to RWA, as well as accession lines PI137739 (Dn1) and PI294994 (Dn5). Analysis of 200 ESTs from the libraries revealed the involvement of transcripts encoding genes involved in cell maintenance, growth and regulation, plant defense and signaling, photosynthesis and energy production, and of unknown function. A selection of these ESTs, in combination with clones obtained from other sources, were used on a custom array to study the expression profiles of 256 candidate wheat sequences putatively involved in plant defense against RWA. The selected sequences included wheat genomic clones with putative nucleotide binding site (NBS) motifs, rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR (RACE-PCR), and cDNA clones from RWA induced libraries. Genomic banana and flax clones that were obtained using representative difference analysis (RDA), and suspected to be involved in abiotic stress responses, were also spotted onto the microarray slides. The spotted custom arrays were then hybridized against cDNA isolated from a resistant cultivar ""TugelaDN"" on 0, 2, 5, and 8 days after infestation, post-labeled with Cy3- or Cy5-fluorescent dyes. The subsequent expression profiling using DNA microarray, RT-PCR, and Northern Blot analysis identified 29 transcripts associated with the feeding response. These transcripts encoded proteins functioning in direct defense and signaling, oxidative burst, cell wall degradation, cell maintenance, photosynthesis, and energy production. Results indicate that plants co-ordinately regulate gene expression when attacked by RWA. It is hypothesized that the NBS-LRR proteins are important in receptor recognition and signaling, which enable the plant to overcome the stresses inflicted by RWA feeding. It is further suggested that the ability to maintain photosynthetic function with resultant energy production is one of the determining factors ensuring the survival of the resistant varieties when coping with the RWA feeding."

"18577625","abstracttext","Changes in ileal bacterial populations of Salmonella-infected turkeys fed different diets were analyzed by using 16S-V3 PCR denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Turkeys raised on litter flooring were fed wheat- and corn-based diets with and without enzyme preparations (XY1 and XY2, respectively) from 0 to 126 d. Preparation XY1 contained exclusively endoxylanase, whereas preparation XY2 contained endoxylanase, protease, and alpha-amylase (Danisco, , Wiltshire, UK). The dietary activity levels of XY1 and XY2 were 2,500 and 650 endo-1,4-beta-xylanase units/kg of feed, respectively. Microbial DNA was extracted from the ileal content of 16-wk-old turkeys, and the 16S rDNA gene was amplified by PCR and analyzed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Diversity indexes, including richness (number of species, S), evenness (relative distribution of species, EH), diversity (using Shannon's index, H'), and Sorenson's pairwise similarities coefficient (measures the species in common between different habitats, Cs) were calculated. Additionally, diversity indexes were associated with Salmonella prevalence determined from fresh fecal droppings collected from each pen. On the basis of contrast analysis, the wheat-based diets resulted in higher microbial diversity indexes than the corn-based diets (S = 10 vs. 12; EH = 0.9 vs. 0.8; H' = 2.2 vs. 1.9, P < 0.05). Likewise, enzyme supplementation stimulated growth of the microbiota and increased the diversity indexes in comparison with unsupplemented treatments (S = 13 vs. 10; EH = 0.9 vs. 0.8; H' = 2.2 vs. 1.9, P < 0.05). Salmonella prevalence was higher (P < 0.05) at 15 wk in turkeys fed the corn-based diet (Salmonella prevalence = 50%) than in turkeys fed the corn-enzyme (Salmonella prevalence = 13%) and wheat-based (Salmonella prevalence = 0%) dietary treatments. Therefore, contrast analysis showed that birds fed the corn control diet had lower microbiota diversity but higher Salmonella prevalence than birds fed the enzyme-supplemented and wheat-based diets. In contrast, birds fed the wheat-based diets had higher diversity but lower Salmonella prevalence than birds fed the corn-based diets. High dietary nonstarch polysaccharides from wheat and dietary exogenous enzyme supplementation promoted microbial community diversity and apparently discouraged Salmonella colonization through competitive exclusion. Nonstarch polysaccharides and dietary exogenous enzyme supplementation may be practical tools to control enteric pathogens and benefit the intestinal health and food safety of the birds."

"21981858","abstracttext_background","Increasing the nutrient concentration of wheat grains is important to ameliorate nutritional deficiencies in many parts of the world. Proteins and nutrients in the wheat grain are largely derived from the remobilization of degraded leaf molecules during monocarpic senescence. The down-regulation of the NAC transcription factor Grain Protein Content (GPC) in transgenic wheat plants delays senescence (>3 weeks) and reduces the concentration of protein, Zn and Fe in the grain (>30%), linking senescence and nutrient remobilization.Based on the early and rapid up-regulation of GPC in wheat flag leaves after anthesis, we hypothesized that this transcription factor is an early regulator of monocarpic senescence. To test this hypothesis, we used high-throughput mRNA-seq technologies to characterize the effect of the GPC down-regulation on the wheat flag-leaf transcriptome 12 days after anthesis. At this early stage of senescence GPC transcript levels are significantly lower in transgenic GPC-RNAi plants than in the wild type, but there are still no visible phenotypic differences between genotypes."

Following normalization and statistical testing, we identified a set of 691 genes differentially regulated by GPC (431 ≥ 2-fold change). Transcript level ratios between transgenic and wild type plants showed a high correlation (R = 0.83) between qRT-PCR and Illumina results, providing independent validation of the mRNA-seq approach. A set of differentially expressed genes were analyzed across an early senescence time-course."
"21981858","abstracttext_conclusions","Monocarpic senescence is an active process characterized by large-scale changes in gene expression which begins considerably before the appearance of visual symptoms of senescence. The mRNA-seq approach used here was able to detect small differences in transcript levels during the early stages of senescence. This resulted in an extensive list of GPC-regulated genes, which includes transporters, hormone regulated genes, and transcription factors. These GPC-regulated genes, particularly those up-regulated during senescence, provide valuable entry points to dissect the early stages of monocarpic senescence and nutrient remobilization in wheat."

"22494247","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), caused by the necrotrophic fungus Stagonospora nodorum (teleomorph: Phaeosphaeria nodorum), is among the most common diseases of winter wheat in the United States. New opportunities in resistance breeding have arisen from the recent discovery of several necrotrophic effectors (NEs, also known as host-selective toxins) produced by S. nodorum, along with their corresponding host sensitivity (Snn) genes. Thirty-nine isolates of S. nodorum collected from wheat debris or grain from seven states in the southeastern United States were used to investigate the production of NEs in the region. Twenty-nine cultivars with varying levels of resistance to SNB, representing 10 eastern-U.S. breeding programs, were infiltrated with culture filtrates from the S. nodorum isolates in a randomized complete block design. Three single-NE Pichia pastoris controls, two S. nodorum isolate controls, and six Snn-differential wheat controls were also used. Cultivar-isolate interactions were visually evaluated for sensitivity at 7 days after infiltration. Production of NEs was detected in isolates originating in each sampled state except Maryland. Of the 39 isolates, 17 produced NEs different from those previously characterized in the upper Great Plains region. These novel NEs likely correspond to unidentified Snn genes in Southeastern wheat cultivars, because NEs are thought to arise under selection pressure from genes for resistance to biotrophic pathogens of wheat cultivars that differ by geographic region. Only 3, 0, and 23% of the 39 isolates produced SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3, respectively, by the culture-filtrate test. A Southern dot-blot test showed that 15, 74, and 39% of the isolates carried the genes for those NEs, respectively; those percentages were lower than those found previously in larger international samples. Only two cultivars appeared to contain known Snn genes, although half of the cultivars displayed sensitivity to culture filtrates containing unknown NEs. Effector sensitivity was more frequent in SNB-susceptible cultivars than in moderately resistant (MR) cultivars (P = 0.008), although some susceptible cultivars did not exhibit sensitivity to NEs produced by isolates in this study and some MR cultivars were sensitive to NEs of multiple isolates. Our results suggest that NE sensitivities influence but may not be the only determinant of cultivar resistance to S. nodorum. Specific knowledge of NE and Snn gene frequencies in this region can be used by wheat breeding programs to improve SNB resistance."

"19566949","abstracttext_background","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici is a fungal pathogen causing stripe rust, one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide. The fungus is strictly biotrophic and thus, completely dependent on living host cells for its reproduction, which makes it difficult to study genes of the pathogen. In spite of its economic importance, little is known about the molecular basis of compatible interaction between the pathogen and wheat host. In this study, we identified wheat and P. striiformis genes associated with the infection process by conducting a large-scale transcriptomic analysis using cDNA-AFLP."
"19566949","abstracttext_results","Of the total 54,912 transcript derived fragments (TDFs) obtained using cDNA-AFLP with 64 primer pairs, 2,306 (4.2%) displayed altered expression patterns after inoculation, of which 966 showed up-regulated and 1,340 down-regulated. 186 TDFs produced reliable sequences after sequencing of 208 TDFs selected, of which 74 (40%) had known functions through BLAST searching the GenBank database. Majority of the latter group had predicted gene products involved in energy (13%), signal transduction (5.4%), disease/defence (5.9%) and metabolism (5% of the sequenced TDFs). BLAST searching of the wheat stem rust fungus genome database identified 18 TDFs possibly from the stripe rust pathogen, of which 9 were validated of the pathogen origin using PCR-based assays followed by sequencing confirmation. Of the 186 reliable TDFs, 29 homologous to genes known to play a role in disease/defense, signal transduction or uncharacterized genes were further selected for validation of cDNA-AFLP expression patterns using qRT-PCR analyses. Results confirmed the altered expression patterns of 28 (96.5%) genes revealed by the cDNA-AFLP technique."
"19566949","abstracttext_conclusion","The results show that cDNA-AFLP is a reliable technique for studying expression patterns of genes involved in the wheat-stripe rust interactions.

The present study should be helpful in elucidating the molecular basis of the infection process, and identifying genes that can be targeted for inhibiting the growth and reproduction of the pathogen. Moreover, this study can also be used to elucidate the defence responses of the genes that were of plant origin."

Although transcriptome and proteome analyses during seed germination have been reported in some crop plant species, dynamic transcriptome characterization during wheat seed germination has not been conducted. We performed the first comprehensive dynamic transcriptome analysis during different seed germination stages of elite Chinese bread wheat cultivar Jimai 20 using the Affymetrix Wheat Genome Array."
"24410729","abstracttext_results","A total of 61,703 probe sets representing 51,411 transcripts were identified during the five seed germination stages of Jimai 20, of which 2,825 differential expression probe sets corresponding to 2,646 transcripts with different functions were declared by ANOVA and a randomized variance model. The seed germination process included a rapid initial uptake phase (0-12 hours after imbibition [HAI]), a plateau phase (12-24 HAI), and a further water uptake phase (24-48 HAI), corresponding to switches from the degradation of small-molecule sucrose to the metabolism of three major nutrients and to photosynthesis. Hierarchical cluster and MapMan analyses revealed changes in several significant metabolism pathways during seed germination as well as related functional groups. The signal pathway networks constructed with KEGG showed three important genes encoding the phosphofructokinase family protein, with fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase, and UTP-glucose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase located at the center, indicating their pivotal roles in the glycolytic pathway, gluconeogenesis, and glycogenesis, respectively. Several significant pathways were selected to establish a metabolic pathway network according to their degree value, which allowed us to find the pathways vital to seed germination. Furthermore, 51 genes involved in transport, signaling pathway, development, lipid metabolism, defense response, nitrogen metabolism, and transcription regulation were analyzed by gene co-expression network with a k-core algorithm to determine which play pivotal roles in germination. Twenty-three meaningful genes were found, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis validated the expression patterns of 12 significant genes."
"24410729","abstracttext_conclusions","Wheat seed germination comprises three distinct phases and includes complicated regulation networks involving a large number of genes. These genes belong to many functional groups, and their co-regulations guarantee regular germination. Our results provide new insight into metabolic changes during seed germination and interactions between some significant genes."
"25100845","articletitle","An eriophyid mite-transmitted plant virus contains eight genomic RNA segments with unusual heterogeneity in the nucleocapsid protein."
"25100845","abstracttext","Eriophyid mite-transmitted, multipartite, negative-sense RNA plant viruses with membrane-bound spherical virions are classified in the genus Emaravirus. We report here that the eriophyid mite-transmitted Wheat mosaic virus (WMoV), an Emaravirus, contains eight genomic RNA segments, the most in a known negative-sense RNA plant virus. Remarkably, two RNA 3 consensus sequences, encoding the nucleocapsid protein, were found with 12.5% sequence divergence, while no heterogeneity was observed in the consensus sequences of additional genomic RNA segments. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, glycoprotein precursor, nucleocapsid, and P4 proteins of WMoV exhibited limited sequence homology with the orthologous proteins of other emaraviruses, while proteins encoded by additional genomic RNA segments displayed no significant homology with proteins reported in GenBank, suggesting that the genus Emaravirus evolved further with a divergent octapartite genome. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that WMoV formed an evolutionary link between members of the Emaravirus genus and the family Bunyaviridae. Furthermore, genomic-length virus- and virus-complementary (vc)-sense strands of all WMoV genomic RNAs accumulated asymmetrically in infected wheat, with 10- to 20-fold more virus-sense genomic RNAs than vc-sense RNAs. These data further confirm the octapartite negative-sense polarity of the WMoV genome. In WMoV-infected wheat, subgenomic-length mRNAs of vc sense were detected for genomic RNAs 3, 4, 7, and 8 but not for other RNA species, suggesting that the open reading frames present in the complementary sense of genomic RNAs are expressed through subgenomic- or near-genomic-length vc-sense mRNAs. Importance: Wheat mosaic virus (WMoV), an Emaravirus, is the causal agent of High Plains disease of wheat and maize. In this study, we demonstrated that the genome of WMoV comprises eight negative-sense RNA segments with an unusual sequence polymorphism in an RNA encoding the nucleocapsid protein but not in the additional genomic RNA segments. WMoV proteins displayed weak or no homology with reported emaraviruses, suggesting that the genus Emaravirus further evolved with a divergent octapartite genome. The current study also examined the profile of WMoV RNA accumulation in wheat and provided evidence for the synthesis of subgenomic-length mRNAs of virus complementary sense. This is the first report to demonstrate that emaraviruses produce subgenomic-length mRNAs that are most likely utilized for genome expression. Importantly, this study facilitates the examination of gene functions and virus diversity and the development of effective diagnostic methods and management strategies for an economically important but poorly understood virus."
"28577083","articletitle","Genome-wide association study for agronomic and physiological traits in spring wheat evaluated in a range of heat prone environments."
"28577083","abstracttext_key message","We identified 27 stable loci associated with agronomic traits in spring wheat using genome-wide association analysis, some of which confirmed previously reported studies. GWAS peaks identified in regions where no QTL for grain yield per se has been mapped to date, provide new opportunities for gene discovery and creation of new cultivars with desirable alleles for improving yield and yield stability in wheat. We undertook large-scale genetic analysis to determine marker-trait associations (MTAs) underlying agronomic and physiological performance in spring wheat using genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Field trials were conducted at seven sites in three countries (Sudan, Egypt, and Syria) over 2-3 years in each country. Twenty-five agronomic and physiological traits were measured on 188 wheat genotypes. After correcting for population structure and relatedness, a total of 245 MTAs distributed over 66 loci were associated with agronomic traits in individual and mean performance across environments respectively; some of which confirmed previously reported loci. Of these, 27 loci were significantly associated with days to heading, thousand kernel weight, grain yield, spike length, and leaf rolling for mean performance across environments. Despite strong QTL by environment interactions, eight of the loci on chromosomes 1A, 1D, 5A, 5D, 6B, 7A, and 7B had pleiotropic effects on days to heading and yield components (TKW, SM -2 , and SNS). The winter-type alleles at the homoeologous VRN1 loci significantly increased days to heading and grain yield in optimal environments, but decreased grain yield in heat prone environments. Top 20 high-yielding genotypes, ranked by additive main effects and multiplicative interaction (AMMI), had low kinship relationship and possessed 4-5 favorable alleles for GY MTAs except two genotypes, Shadi-4 and Qafzah-11/Bashiq-1-2. This indicated different yield stability mechanisms due to potentially favorable rare alleles that are uncharacterized. Our results will enable wheat breeders to effectively introgress several desirable alleles into locally adapted germplasm in developing wheat varieties with high yield stability and enhanced heat tolerance."

Among these, rust diseases are the most detrimental in terms of depressing wheat production. In the present study, chemical mutagenesis was used to induce mutations in the wheat variety NN-Gandum-1. This cultivar is moderately resistant to leaf and yellow rust. The aim of mutagenesis was to improve resistance to the disease as well as to study function of genes conferring resistance to the disease. In the present investigation, a 0.8% EMS dose was found optimum for supporting 45-55% germination of NN-Gandum-1. A total of 3,634 M2 fertile plants were produced from each of the M1 plant. Out of these, 33 (0.91%) and 20 plants (0.55%) showed absolute resistance to leaf and yellow rust, respectively. While 126 (3.46%) and 127 plants (3.49%) exhibited high susceptibility to the leaf and yellow rust, respectively. In the M4 generation, a total of 11 M4 lines (nine absolute resistant and two highly susceptible) and one wild type were selected for NGS-based exome capture assay. A total of 104,779 SNPs were identified that were randomly distributed throughout the wheat sub genomes (A, B and D). Induced mutations in intronic sequences predominated. The highest total number of SNPs detected in this assay were mapped to chr.2B (14,273 SNPs), which contains the highest number of targeted base pairs in the assay. The average mutation density across all regions interrogated was estimated to be one mutation per 20.91 Mb. The highest mutation frequency was found in chr.2D (1/11.7 kb) and the lowest in chr.7D (1/353.4 kb). Out of the detected mutations, 101 SNPs were filtered using analysis criteria aimed to enrich for mutations that may affect gene function. Out of these, one putative SNP detected in Lr21 were selected for further analysis. The SNP identified in chimeric allele (Lr21) of a resistant mutant (N1-252) was located in a NBS domain of chr.1BS at 3.4 Mb position. Through computational analysis, it was demonstrated that this identified SNP causes a substitution of glutamic acid with alanine, resulting in a predicted altered protein structure. This mutation, therefore, is a candidate for contributing to the resistance phenotype in the mutant line. Based on this work, we conclude that the wheat mutant resource developed is useful as a source of novel genetic variation for forward-genetic screens and also as a useful tool for gaining insights into the important biological circuits of different traits of complex genomes like wheat."
"30034404","articletitle","Genome-Wide Association Study for Spot Blotch Resistance in Hard Winter Wheat."
"30034404","abstracttext","Spot blotch (SB) caused by Cochliobolus sativus (anamorph: Bipolaris sorokiniana ) is an economically important disease of wheat worldwide. Under a severe epidemic condition, the disease can cause yield losses up to 70%. Previous approaches like bi-parental mapping for identifying SB resistant genes/QTLs exploited only a limited portion of the available genetic diversity with a lower capacity to detect polygenic traits, and had a lower marker density. In this study, we performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) for SB resistance in hard winter wheat association mapping panel (HWWAMP) of 294 genotypes. The HWWAMP was evaluated for response to B. sorokiniana (isolate SD40), and a range of reactions was observed with 10 resistant, 38 moderately resistant, 120 moderately resistant- moderately susceptible, 111 moderately susceptible, and 15 susceptible genotypes. GWAS using 15,590 high-quality SNPs and 294 genotypes we identified six QTLs ( p = <0.001) on chromosomes 2D, 3A, 4A, 4B, 5A, and 7B that collectively explained 30% of the total variation for SB resistance. Highly associated SNPs were identified for all six QTLs, QSb.sdsu-2D.1 (SNP: Kukri_c31121_1460, R 2 = 4%), QSb.sdsu-3A.1 (SNP: Excalibur_c46082_440, R 2 = 4%), QSb.sdsu-4A. 1 (SNP: IWA8475, R 2 = 5.5%), QSb.sdsu-4B.1 (SNP: Excalibur_rep_c79414_306, R 2 = 4%), QSb.sdsu-5A.1 (SNP: Kukri_rep_c104877_2166, R 2 = 6%), and QSb.sdsu-7B.1 (SNP: TA005844-0160, R 2 = 6%). Our study not only validates three (2D, 5A, and 7B) genomic regions identified in previous studies but also provides highly associated SNP markers for marker assisted selection. In addition, we identified three novel QTLs ( QSb.sdsu-3A.1 , QSb.sdsu-4A. 1, and QSb.sdsu-4B.1 ) for SB resistance in wheat. Gene annotation analysis of the candidate regions identified nine NBS-LRR and 38 other plant defense-related protein families across multiple QTLs, and these could be used for fine mapping and further characterization of SB resistance in wheat. Comparative analysis with barley indicated the SB resistance locus on wheat chromosomes 2D, 3A, 5A, and 7B identified in our study are syntenic to the previously identified SB resistance locus on chromosomes 2H, 3H, 5H, and 7H in barley. The 10 highly resistant genotypes and SNP markers identified in our study could be very useful resources for breeding of SB resistance in wheat."

"30564753","abstracttext","This study investigated the effects of xylanase supplementations with cereal-based diets on nutrient digestibility and gut microbiota of growing pigs. A total of 96 individually penned pigs (initial BW = 22.7 ± 0.65 kg) were allotted to 12 treatments and subjected to a completely randomized block design experiment. Pigs in each treatment were fed an isocaloric wheat-based or corn-based diet with or without 1 of 5 types of xylanase supplements (XA, XB, XC, XD, XE). On d 42, all piglets were euthanized to obtain ileal and cecal digesta for microbial analysis, which involved high-throughput sequencing of the V1 - V3 regions of 16S rRNA gene. Corn- and wheat-based diets differed ( P  < 0.05) in digestion characteristics. Dietary treatments affected the alpha- and beta-diversities of microbiota in the cecum but not in the ileum. The wheat-based diet increased ( P  < 0.05) alpha-diversity and clustered separately ( P  < 0.05) compared with the corn-based diet. Wheat-based diet also promoted the relative abundance of genus (g.) Succinivibrio while corn-based diet promoted the proportion of family (f.) Veillonellaceae in the community. Among xylanases, only XC within the wheat-based diet altered ( P  < 0.05) the beta-diversity of the cecal microbiota compared with control. For each cereal-based diet and compared with the controls, xylanase treatments affected ( P  < 0.05) the proportions of 5 bacterial taxa in the ileum (f. Peptostreptococcaceae, order [o.] Streptophyta, f. Clostridiaceae , g. Clostridium and g. Streptococcus ) and 8 in the cecum (g. Lactobacillus , g. Streptococcus , class [c.] Clostridia, f. Clostridiaceae, g. Megasphaera , g. Prevotella , g. Roseburia and f. Ruminococcaceae). Network analysis showed that across diets under control treatments, Bacteroidetes was the most influential phylum promoting cooperative relationships among members of the ileum and cecum microbiota. Xylanase treatment, however, reduced the influence of Bacteroidetes and promoted a large number of hub taxa majority of which belonged to the Firmicutes phylum. To maximize the efficiency of xylanase supplementation, our data suggest that xylanase C originated from Bacillus subtilis was more effective when applied to wheat-based diets, while xylanase A originated from Fusarium verticillioides was more beneficial when applied to corn-based diets."

"25740049","abstracttext","Foxtail millet shows variation in positive phenol color reaction (Phr) and negative Phr in grains, but predominant accessions of this crop are negative reaction type, and the molecular genetic basis of the Phr reaction remains unresolved. In this article, we isolated polyphenol oxidase (PPO) gene responsible for Phr using genome sequence information and investigated molecular genetic basis of negative Phr and crop evolution of foxtail millet. First of all, we searched for PPO gene homologs in a foxtail millet genome database using a rice PPO gene as a query and successfully found three copies of the PPO gene. One of the PPO gene homologs on chromosome 7 showed the highest similarity with PPO genes expressed in hulls (grains) of other cereal species including rice, wheat, and barley and was designated as Si7PPO. Phr phenotypes and Si7PPO genotypes completely co-segregated in a segregating population. We also analyzed the genetic variation conferring negative Phr reaction. Of 480 accessions of the landraces investigated, 87 (18.1 %) showed positive Phr and 393 (81.9 %) showed negative Phr. In the 393 Phr negative accessions, three types of loss-of-function Si7PPO gene were predominant and independently found in various locations. One of them has an SNP in exon 1 resulting in a premature stop codon and was designated as stop codon type, another has an insertion of a transposon (Si7PPO-TE1) in intron 2 and was designated as TE1-insertion type, and the other has a 6-bp duplication in exon 3 resulting in the duplication of 2 amino acids and was designated as 6-bp duplication type. As a rare variant of the stop codon type, one accession additionally has an insertion of a transposon, Si7PPO-TE2, in intron 2 and was designated as ""stop codon +TE2 insertion type"". The geographical distribution of accessions with positive Phr and those with three major types of negative Phr was also investigated. Accessions with positive Phr were found in subtropical and tropical regions at frequencies of ca. 25-67 % and those with negative Phr were broadly found in Europe and Asia. The stop codon type was found in 285 accessions and was broadly distributed in Europe and Asia, whereas the TE-1 insertion type was found in 99 accessions from Europe and Asia but was not found in India. The 6-bp duplication type was found in only 8 accessions from Nansei Islands (Okinawa Prefecture) of Japan. We also analyzed Phr in the wild ancestor and concluded that the negative Phr type was likely to have originated after domestication of foxtail millet. It was also implied that negative Phr of foxtail millet arose by multiple independent loss of function of PPO gene through dispersal because of some advantages under some environmental conditions and human selection as in rice and barley."
"32830596","articletitle","First report of Pyrenophora teres f. teres causing leaf spot on wheat in Brazil."
"32830596","abstracttext","Pyrenophora teres f. teres is well known for causing net form net blotch on barley, but its pathogenicity on wheat has also been reported in Hungary (Tóth et al. 2008) and east Russia (Mikhailova et al. 2010). The report from Hungary mentioned symptoms of dark brown necrotic lesions with or without chlorotic margins, while the report from Russia described symptoms similar to tan spot. A survey of fungal pathogens causing leaf spot diseases on wheat in the humid subtropical areas of Paraná State, southern Brazil, was conducted in 2016. Twenty four isolates, representing different wheat fields in the municipalities of Guarapuava and Pinhão, in the state of Paraná, were collected from wheat plants at the soft dough stage. The isolates analyzed in our study were obtained from leaf fragments of wheat cv. Toruk and were removed from the edge of lesions resembling tan spot, a major fungal disease of wheat in that region, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis . The leaves presented oval, diamond, or elongate-shape lesions with tan necrotic spots. Still, they did not always show the brown center, which seemed not very characteristics of tan spot caused by P. tritici-repentis . Yellow halos surrounded the necrotic lesions. The fragments were superficially disinfected for 30 sec in 0.5% sodium hypochlorite, washed in sterile water, dried with a sterile paper towel, and transferred to petri plates containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. After four days of incubation at 24±2ºC and a photoperiod of 12 h, hyphal tips were removed from the PDA medium and transferred to petri plates containing V-8 medium. Plates were incubated for 14 days in alternate cycles of 12 h at 23±2ºC under light and 12 h at 19±2ºC in darkness for sporulation. Pure cultures were obtained from single conidia produced on V-8 medium. Single spore isolates, representing different fields, were obtained from individual leaves. Conidia measuring 38-82 µm × 16-20 µm were smoothly cylindrical and straight, with rounded ends, subhyaline or yellowish brown, with four to seven pseudosepta. Genomic DNA extracted from cultures grown in yeast extract broth medium was used for PCR amplification of the ribosomal internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S ribosomal DNA gene (ITS-5.8S rDNA) using the primers ITS4 and ITS5 described by White et al. (1990). A BLAST search of the GenBank database revealed that the ITS-5.8S rDNA sequence fragments (505 bp) from 12 out of 67 isolates were 99-100% similar to P. teres accession number EF452452 (Andrie et al. 2008). The DNA sequences of three P. teres isolates (20C3, 20A3, and 20A1) were deposited in GenBank (accession nos. MH594043.1, MH594042.1, and MH594041.1, respectively). These isolates were obtained from different fields in the municipality of Pinhão (25° 42 '26 ""S; 51° 38' 0"" W), in Paraná State. To test the pathogenicity of the isolates 20C3, 20A3, and 20A1, a conidial suspension for each isolate with 2-3 × 103 conidia per mL was sprayed at the boot stage (BBCH-scale 45) on leaves of wheat cv. Toruk and on susceptible barley cv. Ana 01 plants growing in pots. Each pot containing 5-7 plants was considered as replicate. Wheat plants were also inoculated with a P. tritici-repentis isolate with a conidial suspension at the same concentration described above to serve as reference of symptoms for tan spot. Wheat and barley plants were also inoculated with sterile water to serve as a control. Six replications were inoculated for each treatment. After inoculation, the plants were maintained in a dew chamber for 24 h and then moved to a growth room at 20±2ºC and 16 h photoperiod. Initially, the leaves of wheat plants inoculated with P. teres exhibited small, irregular, dark lesions surrounded by yellow halos, and later exhibited oval to elongate, pale brown, necrotic lesions, and yellow halos. Differently from tan spot caused by P. tritici-repentis , the wheat leaves inoculated with P. teres f. teres presented a more diffuse yellowing, and the center of necrotic lesions was pale brown. The symptoms observed in the barley leaves were the net form net blotch, which allowed us to infer that the disease was caused by P. teres f. teres isolates. All inoculated plants presented symptoms, with some variation among them. Pyrenophora teres f. teres was reisolated from the inoculated wheat and barley plants. This is the first report of P. teres f. teres causing leaf disease on wheat in Brazil. The finding contributes to a better understanding of the etiology of wheat leaf spots in humid subtropical areas of southern Brazil."
"1252424","articletitle","Effect of thyroid hormones on the level of the hepatic mRNA for alpha2u globulin."
"1252424","abstracttext","A procedure is presented for the purification of alpha2u globulin, a protein synthesized in the liver, secreted into the serum, and excreted in the urine of male rats. The steady-state levels of alpha2u globulin in the serum and liver cytosol fraction of adult male rats have been determined using a radial immunodiffusion assay. A cell-free protein synthesizing system, easily prepared from commercial wheat germ, has been used to identify and quantitate the mRNA coding for alpha2u globulin. Poly(A)-containing RNA isolated from male rat liver directs the synthesis in the wheat germ translational system of a protein which is precipitated by rabbit anti-alpha2u globulin and migrates with authentic alpha2u globulin on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. Poly(A)-containing RNA from the livers of female rats or from the kidneys of male rats, tissues which synthesize no alpha2u globulin, do not direct the synthesis of alpha2u globulin in the wheat germ system. Thyroidectomized male rats had no detectable alpha2u globulin in their sera or liver cytosols, and the livers from these thyroidectomized males were found to contain no translatable mRNA for alpha2u globulin, as measured in the wheat germ system. Administration of L-thyroxine or triiodo-L-thyronine to hyroidectomized males resulted in the synthesis of alpha2u globulin, as measured by increased levels of this protein in sera and liver cytosols. This increase in alpha2u globulin synthesis following thyroid hormone treatment was accompanied by a parallel increase in the functional level of the hepatic mRNA coding for this protein. Treatment of thyroidectomized males with a variety of androgens failed to stimulate alpha2u globulin synthesis, and no alpha2u globulin mRNA could be detected in the livers from these androgen-treated thyroidectomized males. These findings indicate that thyroid hormones influence alpha2u globulin synthesis in male rat liver by acting pretranslationally, possibly by modulating gene transcription, and rule out the possibility of an indirect androgen-mediated effect of thyroid hormones in modulating alpha2u globulin biosynthesis."
"9349269","articletitle","cDNA sequence, genomic organization and differential expression of three Arabidopsis genes for germin/oxalate oxidase-like proteins."
"9349269","abstracttext","Wheat germin is a protein expressed during germination which possesses an oxalate oxidase activity. Germin-type oxalate oxidases have been extensively studied in monocotyledons (wheat and barley) where they are thought to have important functions for development, stress response and defence against pathogens. In contrast, almost nothing is known about the germin-like proteins found in dicotyledons, gymnosperms and myxomycetes. In this work, cDNA clones for three genes (ATGER1, ATGER2 and ATGER3) encoding germin-like proteins, initially characterized as expressed sequence tags (ESTs), from Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA libraries were further characterized. In addition, we isolated and sequenced a Brassica napus cDNA which was strongly homologous to the cDNA for ATGER1. Sequence analysis and secondary structure predictions of the proteins encoded by these cDNAs showed that they possess all the characteristic features of members of the germin family and of the germin/seed globulins/sucrose binding protein superfamily. Sequence comparisons and mapping demonstrated the existence of at least two different gene families in the A. thaliana genome encoding a minimum of three genes for germins. These three genes have been mapped in three different location on the Arabidopsis genome. By northern blot hybridizations we found that these genes are differentially regulated. ATGER1 was expressed during germination, like wheat germin, but also in leaves whereas ATGER2 transcripts were exclusively found in developing embryos, like wheat pseudo-germin. ATGER3 mRNAs were found in leaves and flowers and their abundance was shown to vary during the circadian cycle."
"10567537","articletitle","Characterization of a DNA-binding protein implicated in transcription in wheat mitochondria."
"10567537","abstracttext","To investigate the transcriptional apparatus in wheat mitochondria, mitochondrial extracts were subjected to column chromatography and protein fractions were analyzed by in vitro transcription and mobility shift assays. Fractions eluting from DEAE-Sephacel between 0.2 and 0.3 M KCl displayed DNA-binding activity and supported specific transcription initiated from a wheat cox2 promoter. The active DEAE-Sephacel pool was further resolved by chromatography on phosphocellulose. Fractions that exhibited DNA-binding activity and that stimulated both specific and nonspecific transcription in vitro were highly enriched in a 63-kDa protein (p63). From peptide sequence obtained from purified p63, a cDNA encoding the protein was assembled. The predicted amino acid sequence (612 amino acid residues, 69 kDa) contains a basic N-terminal targeting sequence expected to direct transport of the protein into mitochondria. The p63 sequence also features an acidic domain characteristic of transcriptional activation factors, as well as sequence blocks displaying limited similarity to positionally equivalent regions in sigma factors from eubacteria related to mitochondria. Recombinant p63 possesses DNA-binding activity, exhibiting an affinity for the core cox2 promoter element and upstream regions in gel shift assays and having the ability to enhance specific transcription in vitro. Transcripts encoding p63 are expressed at an early stage in the germination of isolated wheat embryos, in a temporal pattern parallelling that of newly synthesized precursors of cox2, a mitochondrial gene. Taken together, these data suggest a role for p63 in transcription in wheat mitochondria."

"12712246","abstracttext","The coding regions of 28 entries of hexaploid wheat gamma-gliadin genes, gene fragments or pseudogenes in GenBank were used for nucleotide alignment. These sequences could be divided into nine subgroups based on nucleotide variation. The chromosomal locations of five of the seven unassigned subgroups were identified through subgroup-specific polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using Chinese Spring group-1 nulli-tetrasomic lines. Multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions/deletions were identified in each subgroup. With further mining from wheat expressed sequence tag databases and targeted DNA sequencing, two SNPs were confirmed and one SNP was discovered for genes at the Gli-A1, Gli-B1 and Gli-D1 loci. A modified allele-specific PCR procedure for assaying SNPs was used to generate dominant DNA markers based on these three SNPs. For each of these three SNPs, two allele-specific primer sets were used to test Chinese Spring and 52 commercial Australian wheat varieties representing a range of low-molecular-weight (LMW) alleles. PCR results indicated that all were positive with one of the primer sets and negative with the other, with the exception of three varieties containing the 1BL/1RS chromosomal translocation that were negative for both. Furthermore, markers GliA1.1, GliB1.1 and GliD1.1 were found to be correlated with Glu-A3 a, b or c, Glu-B3 b, c, d or e and Glu-D3 a, b or e LMW glutenin alleles, respectively. Markers GliA1.2, GliB1.2 and GliD1.2 were found to be correlated with the Glu-A3 d or e, Glu-B3 a, g or h and Glu-D3 c alleles, respectively. These results indicated that the gamma-gliadin SNP markers could be used for detecting linked LMW glutenin subunit alleles that are important in determining the quality attributes of wheat products."

"15889752","abstracttext","A field experiment was conducted to determine whether resistance to Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko), conferred by the Dn4 gene is affected by genetic background. This was done by comparing the yield responses to Russian wheat aphid-resistant wheat containing Dn4, derived through the backcross method, to those of the corresponding recurrent parents. Infested resistant cultivars had fewer Russian wheat aphids per tiller than infested susceptible cultivars at the Lamar and Fort Collins, CO sites but not at the Akron, CO site. At the Lamar site, resistant cultivars yielded more than the susceptible cultivars. 'Prairie Red' and 'Yumar' were more resistant than 'Prowers', especially at the higher infestation level. Resistance in these cultivars was categorized in a laboratory experiment to confirm this differential expression of resistance. Resistance in Prairie Red, 'Halt', 'Prowers 99', and Yumar was categorized at three plant growth stages. Antibiosis was expressed as reductions in maximum number of nymphs produced per 24 h and intrinsic rate of increase. The maximum number of nymphs produced per 24 h was reduced in Halt and 'Lamar'. Averaged over cultivars, the intrinsic rate of increase was less at jointing than at the seedling or tillering growth stages. Tolerance was expressed in the resistant cultivars as reduced chlorosis and leaf rolling. Growth reductions in infested Prowers 99 plants was less than the other cultivars. This study confirms that some cultivars containing Dn4 may express antibiosis and tolerance, whereas others may not show the same categories. Thus, expression is affected by genetic background."
"18470178","articletitle","The use of cell culture for subchromosomal introgressions of barley yellow dwarf virus resistance from Thinopyrum intermedium to wheat."
"18470178","abstracttext","Barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) resistance has been transferred to wheat from a group 7 chromosome of Thinopyrum (Agropyron) intermedium. The source of the resistance gene was the L1 disomic addition line, which carries the 7Ai-1 chromosome. The resistance locus is on the long arm of this chromosome. BYDV resistant recombinant lines were identified after three or more generations of selection against a group 7 Th. intermedium short arm marker (red coleoptile) and selection for the presence of BYDV resistance. One recombinant line produced by ph. mutant induced homoeologous pairing and 14 recombinant lines induced by cell culture have been identified. Resistance in seven of the cell culture induced recombinants has been inherited via pollen according to Mendelian segregation ratios for up to eight generations. Meiotic analysis of heterozygotes indicates that the alien chromatin in the cell culture induced recombinants is small enough to allow regular meiotic behaviour. The ph-induced recombinant was less regular in meiosis. A probe, pEleAcc2, originally isolated from Th. elongatum and that hybridizes to dispersed repeated DNA sequences, was utilised to detect Th. intermedium chromatin, which confers resistance to BYDV, in wheat backgrounds. Quantification of these hybridization signals indicated that the translocations involved a portion of alien chromatin that was smaller than the complete long arm of 7Ai-1. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis confirmed the loss of the short arm of 7Ai-1 and indicated the retention of segments of the long arm of 7Ai-1. Two 7Ai-1L DNA markers always assorted with the BYDV resistance. A third 7Ai-IL DNA marker was also present in seven of eight recombinants. In all recombinants except TC7, the 7Ai-1L markers replaced the 7DL markers. None of the wheat group 7 markers was missing from TC7. It is concluded that all the resistant lines are the result of recombination with wheat chromosome 7D, except line TC7, which is the result of recombination with an unidentified nongroup 7 chromosome."

"16391022","abstracttext","The genus Pseudomonas (sensu stricto) represents a group of microorganisms directly involved in functions conferring plant health. We performed a study in the DOK long-term agricultural field experiment on the basis of previously published Pseudomonas-selective PCR primers in order to investigate the community structure of the microbial groups defined by the target range of these primers. Three different agricultural management systems, i.e., conventional, biodynamic, and bio-organic, along with mineral and unfertilized controls were investigated, with each system planted with either winter wheat or a grass-clover ley. Amplified small-subunit rRNA gene fragments were analyzed using the genetic profiling techniques restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE), revealing distinct differences between soils planted with winter wheat and grass clover but only minor differences between the management systems. Phylogenetic analyses of 59 clone sequences retrieved from bio-organic and unfertilized systems identified sequences related to Pseudomonas fluorescens and a novel cluster termed Cellvibrio-related Pseudomonadaceae (CRP). The CRP clones were exclusively isolated from winter wheat soil samples and were responsible for the crop-specific differences observed in RFLP and DGGE profiles. New primers were designed for the amplification of CRP targets directly from soil DNA, yielding strong signals exclusively for winter wheat soils. We concluded that crop-associated CRP exist in agricultural soils and that genetic profiling followed by specific probe design represents a valuable approach for identification as well as sensitive and rapid monitoring of novel microbial groups in the environment."
"16535486","articletitle","Conjugative Transfer of Chromosomal Genes between Fluorescent Pseudomonads in the Rhizosphere of Wheat."
"16535486","abstracttext","Bacteria released in large numbers for biocontrol or bioremediation purposes might exchange genes with other microorganisms. Two model systems were designed to investigate the likelihood of such an exchange and some factors which govern the conjugative exchange of chromosomal genes between root-colonizing pseudomonads in the rhizosphere of wheat. The first model consisted of the biocontrol strain CHA0 of Pseudomonas fluorescens and transposon-facilitated recombination (Tfr). A conjugative IncP plasmid loaded with transposon Tn5, in a CHA0 derivative carrying a chromosomal Tn5 insertion, promoted chromosome transfer to auxotrophic CHA0 recipients in vitro. A chromosomal marker (pro) was transferred at a frequency of about 10(sup-6) per donor on wheat roots under gnotobiotic conditions, provided that the Tfr donor and recipient populations each contained 10(sup6) to 10(sup7) CFU per g of root. In contrast, no conjugative gene transfer was detected in soil, illustrating that the root surface stimulates conjugation. The second model system was based on the genetically well-characterized strain PAO of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the chromosome mobilizing IncP plasmid R68.45. Although originally isolated from a human wound, strain PAO1 was found to be an excellent root colonizer, even under natural, nonsterile conditions. Matings between an auxotrophic R68.45 donor and auxotrophic recipients produced prototrophic chromosomal recombinants at 10(sup-4) to 10(sup-5) per donor on wheat roots in artificial soil under gnotobiotic conditions and at about 10(sup-6) per donor on wheat roots in natural, nonsterile soil microcosms after 2 weeks of incubation. The frequencies of chromosomal recombinants were as high as or higher than the frequencies of R68.45 transconjugants, reflecting mainly the selective growth advantage of the prototrophic recombinants over the auxotrophic parental strains in the rhizosphere. Although under field conditions the formation of chromosomal recombinants is expected to be reduced by several factors, we conclude that chromosomal genes, whether present naturally or introduced by genetic modification, may be transmissible between rhizosphere bacteria."

"16540139","abstracttext","A series of in-frame and nested deletion mutations which progressively removed 5'-proximal sequences of the Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) HC-Pro coding region (1152 nucleotides) was constructed and evaluated for pathogenicity to wheat. WSMV HC-Pro mutants with 5'-proximal deletions of 12 to 720 nucleotides systemically infected wheat. Boundary sequences flanking the deletions were stable and unaltered by passage through plants for all deletion mutants except HCD12 (lacking HC-Pro codons 3-6) that exhibited strong bias for G to A substitution at nucleotide 1190 in HC-Pro codon 2 (aspartic acid to asparagine). HC-Pro mutants with 5'-proximal deletions of up to 720 nucleotides retained autoproteolytic activity in vitro. In contrast, 5'-proximal deletion of 852 nucleotides of the HC-Pro coding region (HCD852) abolished both infectivity and in vitro proteolytic activity, confirming that the proteolytic domain of WSMV HC-Pro resides within the carboxy-terminal third of the protein and includes the cysteine proteinase motif (GYCY) conserved among four genera of the family Potyviridae. Inoculation of wheat with HC-Pro deletion mutants also bearing the GUS reporter gene revealed that HCD852 was unable to establish primary infection foci in inoculated leaves, indicating that processing of the P3 amino-terminus was essential. Deletion of as few as 24 nucleotides of HC-Pro (codons 3-10) eliminated transmission by the eriophyid mite vector Aceria tosichella Keifer. Collectively, these results demonstrated similar organization of proteinase and vector transmission functional domains among divergent HC-Pro homologues encoded by potyviruses and tritimoviruses."

"19234853","abstracttext","Responses to photoperiod and low temperature are the two primary adaptive mechanisms which enable wheat plants to synchronize developmental processes with changes in seasonal climate. In this study, the developmental process was characterized at two stages: stem length during the onset of stem elongation and heading date. These two developmental events were monitored and mapped in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of a population generated from a cross between two complementary and locally adapted hard winter wheat cultivars. 'Intrada' undergoes stem elongation earlier but reaches heading later, whereas 'Cimarron' undergoes stem elongation later but reaches heading earlier. Variation in the developmental process in this population was associated with three major QTLs centered on Xbarc200 on chromosome 2B, PPD-D1 on chromosome 2D, and Xcfd14 on chromosome 7D. The Intrada Xbarc200 and Xcfd14 alleles and the Cimarron PPD-D1 allele accelerated both stem elongation and heading stages, or the Cimarron Xbarc200 and Xcfd14 alleles and the Intrada PPD-D1 allele delayed both stem elongation and heading stages. Integrative effects of the three QTLs accounted for 43% (initial stem length) and 68% (heading date) of the overall phenotypic variation in this population. PPD-D1 is a reasonable candidate gene for the QTL on chromosome 2D, PPD-B1 could be associated with the QTL on chromosome 2B, but VRN-D3 (=FT-D1) was not linked with the QTL on chromosome 7D, suggesting that this is a novel locus involved in winter wheat development. Because the PPD-D1 QTL was observed to interact with other two QTLs, all of these QTLs could play a role in the same pathway as involved in photoperiod response of winter wheat."

"19266177","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum, causal agent of Stagonospora nodorum blotch (SNB), is a destructive pathogen of wheat worldwide. As is true for many necrotrophic host-pathogen systems, the wheat-S. nodorum system is complex and resistance to SNB is usually quantitatively inherited. We recently showed that S. nodorum produces at least four proteinaceous host-selective toxins that interact with dominant host sensitivity/susceptibility gene products to induce SNB in seedlings. Here, we evaluated a population of wheat recombinant inbred lines that segregates for Tsn1, Snn2, and Snn3, which confer sensitivity to the toxins SnToxA, SnTox2, and SnTox3, respectively, to determine if compatible host-toxin interactions are associated with adult plant susceptibility to SNB foliar disease under field conditions. Artificial inoculation of the population in 2 years and two locations with a fungal isolate known to produce SnToxA and SnTox2 indicated that compatible SnToxA-Tsn1 and SnTox2-Snn2 interactions accounted for as much as 18 and 15% of the variation in disease severity on the flag leaf, respectively. As previously reported for seedlings, the effects of these two interactions in conferring adult plant susceptibility were largely additive. Additional adult plant resistance QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1B, 4B, and 5A, of which, the 1B and 5A QTLs were previously reported to be associated with seedling resistance to SNB. Therefore, in this population, some of the same QTLs are responsible for seedling and adult plant resistance/susceptibility. This is the first report showing that host-selective toxins confer susceptibility of adult plants to SNB, further substantiating the importance of compatible toxin-host interactions in the wheat-S. nodorum pathosystem."

"19029680","abstracttext","Based on segregation distortion of simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers, we detected a significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) for pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) tolerance on the short arm of chromosome 2D (2DS) in the extremely susceptible population of F2 progeny generated from the cross of PHS tolerant synthetic hexaploid wheat cultivar 'RSP' and PHS susceptible bread wheat cultivar '88-1643'. To identify the QTL of PHS tolerance, we constructed two SSR-based genetic maps of 2DS in 2004 and 2005. One putative QTL associated with PHS tolerance, designated Qphs.sau-2D, was identified within the marker intervals Xgwm261-Xgwm484 in 2004 and in the next year, nearly in the same position, between markers wmc112 and Xgwm484. Confidence intervals based on the LOD-drop-off method ranged from 9 cM to 15.4 cM and almost completely overlapped with marker interval Xgwm261-Xgwm484. Flanking markers near this QTL could be assigned to the C-2DS1-0.33 chromosome bin, suggesting that the gene(s) controlling PHS tolerance is located in that chromosome region. The phenotypic variation explained by this QTL was about 25.73-27.50%. Genotyping of 48 F6 PHS tolerant plants derived from the cross between PHS tolerant wheat cultivar 'RSP' and PHS susceptible bread wheat cultivar 'MY11' showed that the allele of Qphs.sau-2D found in the 'RSP' genome may prove useful for the improvement of PHS tolerance."

"19088320","abstracttext","The structure and stability of the dominant lactic acid bacterium population were assessed during wheat flour sourdough type I propagation by using singly nine strains of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis. Under back-slopping propagation with wheat flour type 0 F114, cell numbers of presumptive lactic acid bacteria varied slightly between and within starters. As determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR and restriction endonuclease analysis-pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analyses, only three (LS8, LS14, and LS44) starters dominated throughout 10 days of propagation. The others progressively decreased to less than 3 log CFU g(-1). Partial sequence analysis of the 16S rRNA and recA genes and PCR-denaturating gradient gel electrophoresis analysis using the rpoB gene allowed identification of Weissella confusa, Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rossiae, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus, and Lactobacillus spp. as the dominant species of the raw wheat flour. At the end of propagation, one autochthonous strain of L. sanfranciscensis was found in all the sourdoughs. Except for L. brevis, strains of the above species were variously found in the mature sourdoughs. Persistent starters were found in association with other biotypes of L. sanfranciscensis and with W. confusa or L. plantarum. Sourdoughs were characterized for acidification, quotient of fermentation, free amino acids, and community-level catabolic profiles by USING Biolog 96-well Eco microplates. In particular, catabolic profiles of sourdoughs containing persistent starters behaved similarly and were clearly differentiated from the others. The three persistent starters were further used for the production of sourdoughs and propagated by using another wheat flour whose lactic acid bacterium population in part differed from the previous one. Also, in this case all three starter strains persisted during propagation."

"17091262","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) is one of the most important fungal wheat diseases worldwide. Understanding the genetics of FHB resistance is key to facilitate the introgression of different FHB resistance genes into adapted wheat. The objective of this project was to study the FHB resistance QTL on chromosome 6B, quantify the phenotypic variation, and qualitatively map the resistance gene as a Mendelian factor. The FHB resistant parent BW278 (AC Domain*2/Sumai 3) was used as the source of the resistance allele. A large recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population was developed from the cross BW278/AC Foremost. The population segregated for three known FHB resistance QTL located on chromosomes 3BSc, 5A, and 6B. Molecular markers on chromosome 6B (WMC104, WMC397, GWM219), 5A (GWM154, GWM304, WMC415), and 3BS (WMC78, GWM566, WMC527) were amplified on approximately 1,440 F2:7 RILs. The marker information was used to select 89 RILs that were fixed homozygous susceptible for the 3BSc and 5A FHB QTLs and were recombinant in the 6B interval. Disease response was evaluated on 89 RILs and parental checks in the greenhouse and field nurseries. Dual floret injection (DFI) was used in greenhouse trials to evaluate disease severity (DS). Macroconidial spray inoculations were used in field nurseries conducted at two locations in southern Manitoba (Carman and Glenlea) over two years 2003 and 2004, to evaluate disease incidence, disease severity, visual rating index, and Fusarium-damaged kernels. The phenotypic distribution for all five-disease infection measurements was bimodal, with lines resembling either the resistant or susceptible checks and parents. All of the four field traits for FHB resistance mapped qualitatively to a coincident position on chromosome 6BS, flanked by GWM133 and GWM644, and is named Fhb2. The greenhouse-DS trait mapped 2 cM distal to Fhb2. Qualitative mapping of Fhb2 in wheat provides tightly linked markers that can reduce linkage drag associated with marker assisted selection of Fhb2 and aid the pyramiding of different resistance loci for wheat improvement."

"17764502","abstracttext","Considerable progress has been made in understanding the function of receptor-like kinase (RLK) genes in model plants. However, much less is known about these genes in crop species. Here we report the characterization of three new wheat RLK genes (TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3). The primary structure of the putative proteins TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3 contained a signal peptide, a cysteine-rich extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a predicted intracellular kinase domain. The fusions between TaRLK-R1, 2 or 3 and the green fluorescence protein (GFP) were targeted to the plasma membrane; such targeting required the signal peptide, extracellular domain and transmembrane domain. Transcription of TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3 was found mainly in the green organs, and was regulated by light. Transcript levels of TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3 increased during the hypersensitive reaction (HR) to stripe rust fungus. In addition, the TaRLK-R3 transcript level was also upregulated by abiotic stresses. Further experiments revealed that the recombinant kinase domain of TaRLK-R3 exhibited auto-phosphorylation activity in vitro. Knocking down the transcript levels of TaRLK-R1, 2 or 3 individually or all together by virus-induced gene silencing compromised the wheat HR to stripe rust fungus. The demonstration of TaRLK-R1, 2 and 3 as positive contributors in the wheat HR to stripe rust fungus suggests a new direction for further functional studies of this important family of RLK genes, and may facilitate the breeding of wheat varieties resistant to stripe rust disease."

"17906848","abstracttext","Rusts and barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) are among the main diseases affecting wheat production world wide for which wild relatives have been the source of a number of translocations carrying resistance genes. Nevertheless, along with desirable traits, alien translocations often carry deleterious genes. We have generated recombinants in a bread wheat background between two alien translocations: TC5, ex-Thinopyrum (Th) intermedium, carrying BYDV resistance gene Bdv2; and T4m, ex-Th. ponticum, carrying rust resistance genes Lr19 and Sr25. Because both these translocations are on the wheat chromosome arm 7DL, homoeologous recombination was attempted in the double hemizygote (TC5/T4m) in a background homozygous for the ph1b mutation. The identification of recombinants was facilitated by the use of newly developed molecular markers for each of the alien genomes represented in the two translocations and by studying derived F(2), F(3) and doubled haploid populations. The occurrence of recombination was confirmed with molecular markers and bioassays on families of testcrosses between putative recombinants and bread wheat, and in F(2) populations derived from the testcrosses. As a consequence it has been possible to derive a genetic map of markers and resistance genes on these previously fixed alien linkage blocks. We have obtained fertile progeny carrying new tri-genomic recombinant chromosomes. Furthermore we have demonstrated that some of the recombinants carried resistance genes Lr19 and Bdv2 yet lacked the self-elimination trait associated with shortened T4 segments. We have also shown that the recombinant translocations are fixed and stable once removed from the influence of the ph1b. The molecular markers developed in this study will facilitate selection of individuals carrying recombinant Th. intermedium-Th. ponticum translocations (Pontin series) in breeding programs."

"16662795","abstracttext","Ribonucleic acid and protein synthesis in developing wheat kernels have been studied through in vivo labeling of wheat heads in culture. In INIA 66R wheat labeled with [5-(3)H]uridine for 24-hour periods between 9 and 33 days after flowering, the total rate of RNA accumulation in endosperm/testa pericarp tissues was highest in the youngest seeds, and declined with increasing seed age. In contrast, the rate of accumulation of poly(A)(+) RNA approximately doubled between 12 and 15 days after flowering, reached a maximum between 15 and 18 days, and declined to half the maximum rate by 24 days. Protein synthetic capacity, measured by in vitro translation of extracted seed RNA, increased in a developmental pattern similar to that of poly(A)(+) RNA accumulation, but remained near maximal through 24 days after flowering. Gliadins were prominent in the in vitro translation products. When seed protein was labeled in vivo with l-[(3)H]leucine, extracted, and analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a significant change in the protein synthesis profile was apparent between 12 and 15 days after flowering, and was coincident with a marked increase in storage protein synthesis. Qualitatively similar characteristics were exhibited by the cultivar Cheyenne, although in a shorter developmental period. These results are consistent with a direct relation between levels of mRNA and rates of protein synthesis in developing wheat seeds, with a relatively long storage protein mRNA lifetime, and with control of storage protein gene expression primarily at the level of mRNA transcription."

"18791024","abstracttext","Gibberella zeae is one of the most devastating pathogens of barley and wheat in the United States. The fungus also infects noncereal crops, such as potatoes and sugar beets, and the genetic relationships among barley, wheat, potato, and sugar beet isolates indicate high levels of similarity. However, little is known about the toxigenic potential of G. zeae isolates from potatoes and sugar beets. A total of 336 isolates of G. zeae from barley, wheat, potatoes, and sugar beets were collected and analyzed by TRI (trichothecene biosynthesis gene)-based PCR assays. To verify the TRI-based PCR detection of genetic markers by chemical analysis, 45 representative isolates were grown in rice cultures for 28 days and 15 trichothecenes and 2 zearalenone (ZEA) analogs were quantified using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. TRI-based PCR assays revealed that all isolates had the deoxynivalenol (DON) marker. The frequencies of isolates with the 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15-ADON) marker were higher than those of isolates with the 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3-ADON) marker among isolates from all four crops. Fusarium head blight (FHB)-resistant wheat cultivars had little or no influence on the diversity of isolates associated with the 3-ADON and 15-ADON markers. However, the frequency of isolates with the 3-ADON marker among isolates from the Langdon, ND, sampling site was higher than those among isolates from the Carrington and Minot, ND, sites. In chemical analyses, DON, 3-ADON, 15-ADON, b-ZEA, and ZEA were detected. All isolates produced DON (1 to 782 microg/g) and ZEA (1 to 623 microg/g). These findings may be useful for monitoring mycotoxin contamination and for formulating FHB management strategies for these crops."
"20140662","articletitle","Marker-assisted characterization of durum wheat Langdon-Golden Ball disomic substitution lines."
"20140662","abstracttext","The durum wheat cultivar 'Golden Ball' (GB) is a source of resistance to wheat sawfly due to its superior solid stem. In the late 1980s, Dr. Leonard Joppa developed a complete set of 14 'Langdon' (LDN)-GB disomic substitution (DS) lines by using GB as the chromosome donor and LDN as the recipient. However, these substitution lines have not been previously characterized and reported in the literature. The objectives of this study were to confirm the authenticity of the substituted chromosomes and to analyze the genetic background of the 14 LDN-GB DS lines with the aid of molecular markers, and to further use the substitution lines for chromosomal localization of DNA markers and genes conferring the superior stem solidness in GB. Results from simple sequence repeat marker analysis validated the authenticity of the substituted chromosomes in 14 LDN-GB DS lines. Genome-wide scans using the target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) marker system produced a total of 359 polymorphic fragments that were used to compare the genetic background of substitution lines with that of LDN. Among the polymorphic TRAP markers, 134 (37.3%) and 185 (51.5%) were present in LDN and GB, respectively, with only 10 (2.8%) derived from Chinese Spring. Therefore, marker analysis demonstrated that each LDN-GB DS line had a pair of chromosomes from GB with a genetic background similar to that of LDN. Of the TRAP markers generated in this study, 200 were successfully assigned to specific chromosomes based on their presence or absence in the corresponding LDN-GB DS lines. Also, evaluation of stem solidness in the substitution lines verified the presence of a major gene for stem solidness in chromosome 3B. Results from this research provides useful information for the utilization of GB and LDN-GB DS lines for genetic and genomic studies in tetraploid wheat and for the improvement of stem solidness in both durum and bread wheat."

"20585749","abstracttext","A series of expressed sequence tags-derived polymerase chain reaction (EST-PCR) markers specific to chromosome 2Ai#2 from Thinopyrum intermedium were developed in this study using a new integrative approach. The target alien chromosome confers high resistance to barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), which is a severe virus disease in wheat. To generate markers evenly distributed on 2Ai#2, a total of 105 primer pairs were designed based on mapped ESTs from 8 bins of wheat chromosome 2B with intron-prediction by aligning ESTs with genomic sequences of the new model plant Brachypodium distachyon. Eight and seven polymorphic markers on the short arm and the long arm of chromosome 2Ai#2, respectively, were obtained with a polymorphism rate of 14.3%. These chromosome 2Ai#2-specific EST-PCR markers were then used in tracing and exploring the structural variation of the alien chromosome in the population derived from the immature embryo culture of the cross between N452, a 2Ai#2(2D) substitution line, and common wheat CB037. Two centric fusion of translocations involving 2Ai#2 short or long arm with wheat chromosome 2D and some new genetic stocks including telosomes with the alien chromosome short or long arm were identified in the SC(3) generations, which provided basic materials to further study the mechanism of the BYDV resistance. BYDV tests in two field seasons suggest that the BYDV resistance was mainly conferred by the short arm, gene interaction on both arms of the alien chromosome was discussed."

"20407740","abstracttext","Thinopyrum bessarabicum (2n = 2x = 14, JJ or E(b)E(b)) is an important genetic resource for wheat improvement due to its salinity tolerance and disease resistance. Development of wheat-Th. bessarabicum translocation lines will facilitate its practical utilization in wheat improvement. In this study, a novel wheat-Th. bessarabicum translocation line T2JS-2BS.2BL, which carries a segment of Th. bessarabicum chromosome arm 2JS was identified and further characterized using sequential chromosome C-banding, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH), dual-color fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and DNA markers. The translocation breakpoint was mapped within bin C-2BS1-0.53 of chromosome 2B through marker analysis. Compared to the Chinese Spring (CS) parent and to CS-type lines, the translocation line has more fertile spikes per plant, longer spikes, more grains per spike and higher yield per plant, which suggests that the alien segment carries yield-related genes. However, plants with the translocation are also taller, head later and have lower 1,000-kernel weight than CS or CS-type lines. By using markers specific to the barley photoperiod response gene Ppd-H1, it was determined that the late heading date was conferred by a recessive allele located on the 2JS segment. In addition, four markers specific for the translocated segment were identified, which can be used for marker-aided screening."
"19825627","articletitle","The level of expression of thioredoxin is linked to fundamental properties and applications of wheat seeds."
"19825627","abstracttext","Work with cereals (barley and wheat) and a legume (Medicago truncatula) has established thioredoxin h (Trx h) as a central regulatory protein of seeds. Trx h acts by reducing disulfide (S-S) groups of diverse seed proteins (storage proteins, enzymes, and enzyme inhibitors), thereby facilitating germination. Early in vitro protein studies were complemented with experiments in which barley seeds with Trx h overexpressed in the endosperm showed accelerated germination and early or enhanced expression of associated enzymes (alpha-amylase and pullulanase). The current study extends the transgenic work to wheat. Two approaches were followed to alter the expression of Trx h genes in the endosperm: (1) a hordein promoter and its protein body targeting sequence led to overexpression of Trx h5, and (2) an antisense construct of Trx h9 resulted in cytosolic underexpression of that gene (Arabidopsis designation). Underexpression of Trx h9 led to effects opposite to those observed for overexpression Trx h5 in barley-retardation of germination and delayed or reduced expression of associated enzymes. Similar enzyme changes were observed in developing seeds. The wheat lines with underexpressed Trx showed delayed preharvest sprouting when grown in the greenhouse or field without a decrease in final yield. Wheat with overexpressed Trx h5 showed changes commensurate with earlier in vitro work: increased solubility of disulfide proteins and lower allergenicity of the gliadin fraction. The results are further evidence that the level of Trx h in cereal endosperm determines fundamental properties as well as potential applications of the seed."

"21556764","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), is a devastating disease of wheat. The use of wheat cultivars resistant to powdery mildew provides an effective, economical, and environmentally friendly method to control the disease. Previously, we identified a dominant resistance gene, temporarily named Pmhym, from the wheat cultivar Hongyoumai. In order to screen differential transcripts related to Pmhym-mediated resistance, four F3 homozygous resistant and four susceptible progenies derived from the Hongyoumai/Yumai13 cross were selected to construct two different pools, respectively, representing an incompatible and compatible interaction with Bgt. Pre-inoculated control and the pathogen-inoculated treatments at 24 h post inoculation (hpi) were used. Three groups of differential genes were categorized from three comparisons as pre- and post-induced, respectively, in two interactions, and post-induced between incompatible and compatible interaction. It was found that salicylic acid (SA), jasmonate (JA), and ethylene (ET) signaling-related genes were differentially expressed, thus suggesting that they are involved in the defensive response against Bgt infection. In compatible interactions, the genes involved in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling pathway might be inhibitory to the above-mentioned three pathways, resulting in a susceptible reaction. Genes involved in disease/defense, signal transduction, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism were up-regulated in incompatible interactions, implying a role in resistant response. The results of qRT-PCR analysis on several candidate genes were consistent in their expression patterns as revealed by microarray analysis. The differential expression analyses in the present study are good candidates for further elucidation of wheat defensive response to powdery mildew."

"21592357","abstracttext_background","The wheat tribe Triticeae (Poaceae) is a diverse group of grasses representing a textbook example of reticulate evolution. Apart from globally important grain crops, there are also wild grasses which are of great practical value. Allohexaploid intermediate wheatgrass, Thinopyrum intermedium (2n = 6x = 42), possesses many desirable agronomic traits that make it an invaluable source of genetic material useful in wheat improvement. Although the identification of its genomic components has been the object of considerable investigation, the complete genomic constitution and its potential variability are still being unravelled. To identify the genomic constitution of this allohexaploid, four accessions of intermediate wheatgrass from its native area were analysed by sequencing of chloroplast trnL-F and partial nuclear GBSSI, and genomic in situ hybridization."
"21592357","abstracttext_results","The results confirmed the allopolyploid origin of Thinopyrum intermedium and revealed new aspects in its genomic composition. Genomic heterogeneity suggests a more complex origin of the species than would be expected if it originated through allohexaploidy alone. While Pseudoroegneria is the most probable maternal parent of the accessions analysed, nuclear GBSSI sequences suggested the contribution of distinct lineages corresponding to the following present-day genera: Pseudoroegneria, Dasypyrum, Taeniatherum, Aegilops and Thinopyrum. Two subgenomes of the hexaploid have most probably been contributed by Pseudoroegneria and Dasypyrum, but the identity of the third subgenome remains unresolved satisfactorily. Possibly it is of hybridogenous origin, with contributions from Thinopyrum and Aegilops. Surprising diversity of GBSSI copies corresponding to a Dasypyrum-like progenitor indicates either multiple contributions from different sources close to Dasypyrum and maintenance of divergent copies or the presence of divergent paralogs, or a combination of both. Taeniatherum-like GBSSI copies are most probably pseudogenic, and the mode of their acquisition by Th. intermedium remains unclear."
"21592357","abstracttext_conclusions","Hybridization has played a key role in the evolution of the Triticeae. Transfer of genetic material via extensive interspecific hybridization and/or introgression could have enriched the species' gene pools significantly. We have shown that the genomic heterogeneity of intermediate wheatgrass is higher than has been previously assumed, which is of particular concern to wheat breeders, who frequently use it as a source of desirable traits in wheat improvement."
"21981731","articletitle","Predicting complex quantitative traits with Bayesian neural networks: a case study with Jersey cows and wheat."
"21981731","abstracttext_background","In the study of associations between genomic data and complex phenotypes there may be relationships that are not amenable to parametric statistical modeling. Such associations have been investigated mainly using single-marker and Bayesian linear regression models that differ in their distributions, but that assume additive inheritance while ignoring interactions and non-linearity. When interactions have been included in the model, their effects have entered linearly. There is a growing interest in non-parametric methods for predicting quantitative traits based on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces regressions on markers and radial basis functions. Artificial neural networks (ANN) provide an alternative, because these act as universal approximators of complex functions and can capture non-linear relationships between predictors and responses, with the interplay among variables learned adaptively. ANNs are interesting candidates for analysis of traits affected by cryptic forms of gene action."
"21981731","abstracttext_results","We investigated various Bayesian ANN architectures using for predicting phenotypes in two data sets consisting of milk production in Jersey cows and yield of inbred lines of wheat. For the Jerseys, predictor variables were derived from pedigree and molecular marker (35,798 single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPS) information on 297 individually cows. The wheat data represented 599 lines, each genotyped with 1,279 markers. The ability of predicting fat, milk and protein yield was low when using pedigrees, but it was better when SNPs were employed, irrespective of the ANN trained. Predictive ability was even better in wheat because the trait was a mean, as opposed to an individual phenotype in cows. Non-linear neural networks outperformed a linear model in predictive ability in both data sets, but more clearly in wheat."
"21981731","abstracttext_conclusion","Results suggest that neural networks may be useful for predicting complex traits using high-dimensional genomic information, a situation where the number of unknowns exceeds sample size. ANNs can capture nonlinearities, adaptively. This may be useful when prediction of phenotypes is crucial."

"21864084","abstracttext","Necrotrophic effectors (also known as host-selective toxins) are important determinants of disease in the wheat-Stagonospora nodorum pathosystem. To date, five necrotrophic effector-host gene interactions have been identified in this system. Most of these interactions have additive effects while some are epistatic. The Snn4-SnTox4 interaction was originally identified in a recombinant-inbred population derived from a cross between the Swiss winter wheat cultivars 'Arina' and 'Forno' using the S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. Here, we used a recombinant-inbred population consisting of 121 lines developed from a cross between the hexaploid land race Salamouni and the hexaploid wheat 'Katepwa' (SK population). The SK population was used for the construction of linkage maps and quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection using the Swiss S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. The linkage maps developed in the SK population spanned 3,228 centimorgans (cM) and consisted of 441 simple-sequence repeats, 9 restriction fragment length polymorphisms, 29 expressed sequence tag sequence-tagged site markers, and 5 phenotypic markers. The average marker density was 6.7 cM/marker. Two QTL, designated QSnb.fcu-1A and QSnb.fcu-7A on chromosome arms 1AS and 7AS, respectively, were associated with disease caused by the S. nodorum isolate Sn99CH 1A7a. The effects of QSnb.fcu-1A were determined by the Snn4-SnTox4 interaction and accounted for 23.5% of the phenotypic variation in this population, whereas QSnb.fcu-7A accounted for 16.4% of the phenotypic variation for disease but was not associated with any known effector sensitivity locus. The effects of both QTL were largely additive and collectively accounted for 35.7% of the total phenotypic variation. The results of this research validate the effects of a compatible Snn4-SnTox4 interaction in a different genetic background, and it provides knowledge regarding genomic regions and molecular markers that can be used to improve Stagonospora nodorum blotch resistance in wheat germplasm."

"22645565","abstracttext","In support of the international effort to obtain a reference sequence of the bread wheat genome and to provide plant communities dealing with large and complex genomes with a versatile, easy-to-use online automated tool for annotation, we have developed the TriAnnot pipeline. Its modular architecture allows for the annotation and masking of transposable elements, the structural, and functional annotation of protein-coding genes with an evidence-based quality indexing, and the identification of conserved non-coding sequences and molecular markers. The TriAnnot pipeline is parallelized on a 712 CPU computing cluster that can run a 1-Gb sequence annotation in less than 5 days. It is accessible through a web interface for small scale analyses or through a server for large scale annotations. The performance of TriAnnot was evaluated in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and general fitness using curated reference sequence sets from rice and wheat. In less than 8 h, TriAnnot was able to predict more than 83% of the 3,748 CDS from rice chromosome 1 with a fitness of 67.4%. On a set of 12 reference Mb-sized contigs from wheat chromosome 3B, TriAnnot predicted and annotated 93.3% of the genes among which 54% were perfectly identified in accordance with the reference annotation. It also allowed the curation of 12 genes based on new biological evidences, increasing the percentage of perfect gene prediction to 63%. TriAnnot systematically showed a higher fitness than other annotation pipelines that are not improved for wheat. As it is easily adaptable to the annotation of other plant genomes, TriAnnot should become a useful resource for the annotation of large and complex genomes in the future."
"23758328","articletitle","Mechanisms regulating grain contamination with trichothecenes translocated from the stem base of wheat (Triticum aestivum) infected with Fusarium culmorum."
"23758328","abstracttext","Factors limiting trichothecene contamination of mature wheat grains after Fusarium infection are of major interest in crop production. In addition to ear infection, systemic translocation of deoxynivalenol (DON) may contribute to mycotoxin levels in grains after stem base infection with toxigenic Fusarium spp. However, the exact and potential mechanisms regulating DON translocation into wheat grains from the plant base are still unknown. We analyzed two wheat cultivars differing in susceptibility to Fusarium head blight (FHB), which were infected at the stem base with Fusarium culmorum in climate chamber experiments. Fungal DNA was found only in the infected stem base tissue, whereas DON and its derivative, DON-3-glucoside (D3G), were detected in upper plant parts. Although infected stem bases contained more than 10,000 μg kg⁻¹ dry weight (DW) of DON and mean levels of DON after translocation in the ear and husks reached 1,900 μg kg⁻¹ DW, no DON or D3G was detectable in mature grains. D3G quantification revealed that DON detoxification took mainly place in the stem basis, where ≤ 50% of DON was metabolized into D3G. Enhanced expression of a gene putatively encoding a uridine diphosphate-glycosyltransferase (GenBank accession number FG985273) was observed in the stem base after infection with F. culmorum. Resistance to F. culmorum stem base infection, DON glycosylation in the stem base, and mycotoxin translocation were unrelated to cultivar resistance to FHB. Histological studies demonstrated that the vascular transport of DON labeled with fluorescein as a tracer from the peduncle to the grain was interrupted by a barrier zone at the interface between grain and rachilla, formerly described as ""xylem discontinuity"". This is the first study to demonstrate the effective control of influx of systemically translocated fungal mycotoxins into grains at the rachilla-seed interface by the xylem discontinuity tissue in wheat ears."
"22538226","articletitle","Surveying of pollen-mediated crop-to-crop gene flow from a wheat field trial as a biosafety measure."
"22538226","abstracttext","Outcrosses from genetically modified (GM) to conventional crops by pollen-mediated gene flow (PMGF) are a concern when growing GM crops close to non-GM fields. This also applies to the experimental releases of GM plants in field trials. Therefore, biosafety measures such as isolation distances and surveying of PMGF are required by the regulatory authorities in Switzerland. For two and three years, respectively, we monitored crop-to-crop PMGF from GM wheat field trials in two locations in Switzerland. The pollen donors were two GM spring wheat lines with enhanced fungal resistance and a herbicide tolerance as a selection marker. Seeds from the experimental plots were sampled to test the detection method for outcrosses. Two outcrosses were found adjacent to a transgenic plot within the experimental area. For the survey of PMGF, pollen receptor plots of the conventional wheat variety Frisal used for transformation were planted in the border crop and around the experimental field up to a distance of 200 m. Although the environmental conditions were favorable and the donor and receptor plots flowered at the same time, only three outcrosses were found in approximately 185,000 tested seedlings from seeds collected outside the experimental area. All three hybrids were found in the border crop surrounding the experimental area, but none outside the field. We conclude that a pollen barrier (border crop) and an additional isolation distance of 5 m is a sufficient measure to reduce PMGF from a GM wheat field trial to cleistogamous varieties in commercial fields below a level that can be detected."

"19309505","abstracttext_background","In order to identify genes that might confer and maintain freeze resistance of winter wheat, a comparative transcriptome analysis was performed between control and 4 wk cold-acclimated crown tissue of two winter wheat lines that differ in field freeze survival. The lines, generated by azide mutagenesis of the winter wheat cultivar 'Winoka' were designated FR (75% survival) and FS (30% survival). Using two winter lines for this comparative analysis removed the influence of differential expression of the vernalization genes and allowed our study to focus on Cbf genes located within the Fr-A2 allele independent of the effect of the closely mapped Vrn allele."
"19309505","abstracttext_results","Vernalization genes, (Vrn-A1, B1 and D1), and the transcription factor gene, TaVrt-2, were up-regulated to the same extent in FR and FS lines with cold acclimation thus confirming that azide mutagenesis had not modified the winter habitat of the lines. One category of Cbf genes, (Cbf-2, -A22 and B-22) reflected an increase in level of expression with cold acclimation in both FR and FS lines. Another category of Cbf genes (Cbf-3, -5, -6, -12, -14 and -19) were differentially expressed between cold-acclimated FR and FS lines relative to the non-acclimated controls. Comparison of expression patterns of the two categories of Cbf genes with the expression patterns of a set of ABA-dependent and -independent Cor/Lea genes revealed similar patterns of expression for this sample of Cor/Lea genes with that for Cbf-2 and -22. This pattern of expression was also exhibited by the Vrn genes."
"19309505","abstracttext_conclusion","Some Cor/Lea genes may be co-regulated by the Vrn genes during cold acclimation and the Vrn genes may also control the expression of Cbf-2, -A22 and -B22. The increased freeze survival by the FR line and the increase in expression levels of wheat Cbf genes, Cbf-3, -5, -6, -12, -14 and -19 with cold acclimation in the FR line suggests a possible gain of function mutation resulting in higher levels of expression of these Cbf genes and increased freeze survival."

"19483772","abstracttext","Resistance to both barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) and cereal yellow dwarf virus (CYDV) has been demonstrated in wheat genetic stocks with Thinopyrum intermedium chromatin. A number of resistance-bearing translocations have been reported on chromosome arm 7DL from two independent Th. intermedium sources; one source is the addition line L1 and the other is the spontaneous substitution line P29. Another source of resistance in wheat cytogenetic stocks is available as a 2Ai(2D) substitution line. We used a set of 38 molecular markers and the available deletion stocks to compare the size of the 7DL translocations more comprehensively than has been done previously. We also compared the efficacy of BYDV resistance of the various genetic stocks both before and after transfer to a common genetic background. TC14 was confirmed as carrying the smallest translocation, replacing about 20% of the distal end of 7DL. TC5 and TC10 had 90% of the chromosome arm replaced by Th. intermedium chromatin; the proximal 10% corresponded to wheat chromatin. YW642 appeared to have the whole 7DL replaced by Th. intermedium chromatin, as confirmed by the co-dominant marker cfd68 mapping on the bin nearest the centromere. Translocation line P961341 had bins 3, 7, and 8 replaced by Th. intermedium chromatin, making this the second smallest translocation with BYDV and CYDV resistance. The translocation sizes reported here differ from some of the previous estimates. The translocated Th. intermedium segments appeared to be bigger than the replaced wheat 7DL fragments. All the resistances derived from the L1 and P29 group 7 chromosomes and the 2Ai#2 chromosome were effective in reducing the number of infected plants and the mean virus titre, regardless of the background. Some evidence is discussed suggesting the long arm of the Th. intermedium group 7 chromosome 7Ai#1 carries two resistances, the distal Bdv2 and a proximal second gene."
"21344182","articletitle","Quantitative trait loci for resistance to fusarium head blight in a Chinese wheat landrace Haiyanzhong."
"21344182","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat causes not only significant reduction in grain yield and end-use quality, but also the contamination of the grain with mycotoxins that are detrimental to human and animal health after consumption of infected grain. Growing resistant varieties is an effective approach to minimize the FHB damage. The Chinese wheat landrace Haiyanzhong (HYZ) shows a high level of resistance to FHB. To identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) that contribute to FHB resistance in HYZ, 136 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) were developed from a cross of HYZ and Wheaton, a hard spring wheat cultivar from the USA. The RIL and their parents were evaluated for percentage of scabbed spikelets (PSS) in both greenhouse and field environments. Five QTL were detected for FHB resistance in HYZ with one major QTL on 7DL. The 7DL QTL peaked at SSR marker Xwmc121, which is flanked by the SSR markers Xcfd46 and Xwmc702. This QTL explained 20.4-22.6% of the phenotypic variance in individual greenhouse experiments and 15.9% in a field experiment. Four other minor QTL on 6BS (two QTL), 5AS and 1AS each explained less than 10% of the phenotypic variance in individual experiments. HYZ carried the favorable alleles associated with FHB resistance at the QTL on 7DL, 6BS and 5AS, and the unfavorable allele at the QTL on 1AS. The major QTL on 7D can be used to improve the FHB resistance in wheat breeding programs and add diversity to the FHB resistance gene pool."
"20975830","articletitle","New insights into the organization, recombination, expression and functional mechanism of low molecular weight glutenin subunit genes in bread wheat."
"20975830","abstracttext","The bread-making quality of wheat is strongly influenced by multiple low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) proteins expressed in the seeds. However, the organization, recombination and expression of LMW-GS genes and their functional mechanism in bread-making are not well understood. Here we report a systematic molecular analysis of LMW-GS genes located at the orthologous Glu-3 loci (Glu-A3, B3 and D3) of bread wheat using complementary approaches (genome wide characterization of gene members, expression profiling, proteomic analysis). Fourteen unique LMW-GS genes were identified for Xiaoyan 54 (with superior bread-making quality). Molecular mapping and recombination analyses revealed that the three Glu-3 loci of Xiaoyan 54 harbored dissimilar numbers of LMW-GS genes and covered different genetic distances. The number of expressed LMW-GS in the seeds was higher in Xiaoyan 54 than in Jing 411 (with relatively poor bread-making quality). This correlated with the finding of higher numbers of active LMW-GS genes at the A3 and D3 loci in Xiaoyan 54. Association analysis using recombinant inbred lines suggested that positive interactions, conferred by genetic combinations of the Glu-3 locus alleles with more numerous active LMW-GS genes, were generally important for the recombinant progenies to attain high Zeleny sedimentation value (ZSV), an important indicator of bread-making quality. A higher number of active LMW-GS genes tended to lead to a more elevated ZSV, although this tendency was influenced by genetic background. This work provides substantial new insights into the genomic organization and expression of LMW-GS genes, and molecular genetic evidence suggesting that these genes contribute quantitatively to bread-making quality in hexaploid wheat. Our analysis also indicates that selection for high numbers of active LMW-GS genes can be used for improvement of bread-making quality in wheat breeding."

"21787874","abstracttext","Before being able to implement effective ruminal methane mitigation strategies via feed supplementation, the assessment of side effects on ruminal fermentation and rumen microbial populations is indispensable. In this respect we investigated the effects of monolaurin, a methane-mitigating lipid, on methanogens and important carbohydrate-degrading bacteria present in ruminal fluid of dairy cattle in continuous culture employing the rumen simulation technique. In six experimental runs, each lasting for 10 days, four diets with different carbohydrate composition, based on hay, maize, wheat and a maize-wheat mixture, either remained non-supplemented or were supplemented with monolaurin and incubated in a ruminal-fluid buffer mixture. Incubation liquid samples from days 6 to 10 of incubation were analyzed with relative quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of 16S rRNA genes to assess monolaurin-induced shifts in specific rumen microbial populations in relation to the corresponding non-supplemented diets. Monolaurin completely inhibited Fibrobacter succinogenes in all diets while the response of the other cellulolytic bacteria varied in dependence of the diet. Megasphaera elsdenii remained unaffected by monolaurin in the two diets containing maize, but was slightly stimulated by monolaurin with the wheat and largely with the hay diet. The supply of monolaurin suppressed Methanomicrobiales below the detection limit with all diets, whereas relative 16S rRNA gene copy numbers of Methanobacteriales increased by 7-fold with monolaurin in case of the hay diet. Total Archaea were decreased by up to over 90%, but this was significant only for the wheat containing diets. Thus, monolaurin exerted variable effects mediated by unknown mechanisms on important ruminal microbes involved in carbohydrate degradation, along with its suppression of methane formation. The applicability of monolaurin for methane mitigation in ruminants thus depends on the extent to which adverse effects on carbohydrate-degrading bacteria actually impair the supply of digested carbohydrates to the animal."

"22074448","abstracttext_background","Manipulation of the amylose-amylopectin ratio in cereal starch has been identified as a major target for the production of starches with novel functional properties. In wheat, silencing of starch branching enzyme genes by a transgenic approach reportedly caused an increase of amylose content up to 70% of total starch, exhibiting novel and interesting nutritional characteristics. In this work, the functionality of starch branching enzyme IIa (SBEIIa) has been targeted in bread wheat by TILLING. An EMS-mutagenised wheat population has been screened using High Resolution Melting of PCR products to identify functional SNPs in the three homoeologous genes encoding the target enzyme in the hexaploid genome."

Two putative null alleles containing non-sense or splice site mutations were identified for each of the three homoeologous SBEIIa genes; qRT-PCR analysis showed a significant decrease of their gene expression and resulted in increased amylose content. Pyramiding of different single null homoeologous allowed to isolate double null mutants showing an increase of amylose content up to 21% compared to the control."

"22183655","articletitle","Characterization of plant-fungal interactions involving necrotrophic effector-producing plant pathogens."
"22183655","abstracttext","Recently, great strides have been made in the area of host-pathogen interactions involving necrotrophic fungi. In this article we describe a method to identify, produce, and characterize effectors that are important in host-necrotrophic fungal pathogen interactions, and to genetically characterize the interactions. The main strength of this method is the combined use of pathogen inoculation, a pathogen culture filtrate bioassay, and genetic analysis of susceptibility and sensitivity in segregating host-mapping populations. These methods have been successfully used to identify several Stagonospora nodorum necrotrophic effectors and to characterize the genetic and phenotypic effects of individual host-effector interactions in the wheat-S. nodorum system. S. nodorum isolates that induce a differential response on two lines are used to produce culture filtrates that contain necrotrophic effectors while the wheat lines differing in reaction to the pathogen are used to develop a mapping population. The wheat population is used to develop DNA marker-based genetic linkage maps and culture filtrates are infiltrated across the mapping population. Linkage and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis is used to identify regions of the wheat genome harboring genes that govern sensitivity to necrotrophic effectors. The same populations are inoculated with the effector-producing isolate to determine the significance and proportion of disease explained by individual host gene-effector interactions. Additionally, from this information, differential lines that are sensitive to single effectors are developed for further purification and characterization of the effectors, eventually resulting in the identification, molecular cloning, and characterization of the effector genes."

"23122232","abstracttext_background","The wild barley Hordeum chilense fulfills some requirements for being a useful tool to investigate the endosperm yellow pigment content (YPC) in the Triticeae including its diploid constitution, the availability of genetic resources (addition and deletion stocks and a high density genetic map) and, especially, its high seed YPC not silenced in tritordeums (amphiploids derived from H. chilense and wheat). Thus, the aim of this work was to test the utility of the H. chilense genome for investigating the YPC in the Triticeae."

Macrocolinearity studies revealed that gene positions were in agreement in H. vulgare and H. chilense. Additionally, three main regions associated with YPC were identified in chromosomes 2Hch, 3Hch and 7Hch in H. chilense, the former being the most significant one."

"23557231","abstracttext_background","The assembly of the bread wheat genome sequence is challenging due to allohexaploidy and extreme repeat content (>80%). Isolation of single chromosome arms by flow sorting can be used to overcome the polyploidy problem, but the repeat content cause extreme assembly fragmentation even at a single chromosome level. Long jump paired sequencing data (mate pairs) can help reduce assembly fragmentation by joining multiple contigs into single scaffolds. The aim of this work was to assess how mate pair data generated from multiple displacement amplified DNA of flow-sorted chromosomes affect assembly fragmentation of shotgun assemblies of the wheat chromosomes."
"23557231","abstracttext_results","Three mate pair (MP) libraries (2 Kb, 3 Kb, and 5 Kb) were sequenced to a total coverage of 89x and 64x for the short and long arm of chromosome 7B, respectively. Scaffolding using SSPACE improved the 7B assembly contiguity and decreased gene space fragmentation, but the degree of improvement was greatly affected by scaffolding stringency applied. At the lowest stringency the assembly N50 increased by ~7 fold, while at the highest stringency N50 was only increased by ~1.5 fold. Furthermore, a strong positive correlation between estimated scaffold reliability and scaffold assembly stringency was observed. A 7BS scaffold assembly with reduced MP coverage proved that assembly contiguity was affected only to a small degree down to ~50% of the original coverage."

"24779355","articletitle","Fusarium graminearum Possesses Virulence Factors Common to Fusarium Head Blight of Wheat and Seedling Rot of Soybean but Differing in Their Impact on Disease Severity."
"24779355","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is a toxigenic fungal pathogen that causes Fusarium head blight (FHB) and crown rot on cereal crops worldwide. This fungus also causes damping-off and crown and root rots at the early stage of crop development in soybean cultivated in North and South America. Several F. graminearum genes were investigated for their contribution to FHB in cereals but no inherent study is reported for the dicotyledonous soybean host. In this study we determined the disease severity on soybean seedlings of five single gene disrupted mutants of F. graminearum, previously characterized in wheat spike infection. Three of these mutants are impaired on a specific function as the production of deoxynivalenol (DON, Δtri5), lipase (ΔFgl1), and xylanase (Δxyl03624), while the remaining two are MAP kinase mutants (ΔFgOS-2, Δgpmk1), which are altered in signaling pathways. The mutants that were reduced in virulence (Δtri5, ΔFgl1, and ΔFgOS-2) or are avirulent (Δgpmk1) on wheat were correspondently less virulent or avirulent in soybean seedlings, as shown by the extension of lesions and seedling lengths. The Δxyl03624 mutant was as virulent as the wild type mirroring the behavior observed in wheat. However, a different ranking of symptom severity occurred in the two hosts: the ΔFgOS-2 mutant, that infects wheat spikelets similarly to Δtri5 and ΔFgl1 mutants, provided much reduced symptoms in soybean. Differently from the other mutants, we observed that the ΔFgOS-2 mutant was several fold more sensitive to the glyceollin phytoalexin suggesting that its reduced virulence may be due to its hypersensitivity to this phytoalexin. In conclusion, lipase and DON seem important for full disease symptom development in soybean seedlings, OS-2 and Gpmk1 MAP kinases are essential for virulence, and OS-2 is involved in conferring resistance to the soybean phytoalexin."

In addition, protoplast-derived plants, and 24-month-old embryogenic and non-embryogenic calli and cell suspension cultures of Florida 302 were also analyzed. No variation was revealed by the wheat or millet mitochondrial clones. Qualitative variation was detected in the nonembryogenic suspension culture by three maize mitochondrial genes (coxI, rrn18-rrn5, atp6). A callus-specific 3.8-kb Hind III fragment was detected in all four cultivars after hybridization with the coxI gene. The organization of the Nor locus of the plants regenerated from Florida 302 and Chris was stable when compared to their respective control plants and calli. The Nor locus in regenerants of Pavon and RH, on the other hand, was found to be variable. However, Nor locus variability was not observed in 14 individual seed-derived control plants from either Pavon or RH sources. In Pavon, a 3.6-kb Taq I or a 5.6-kb Bam HI+ Eco RI fragment was lost after regeneration. In one of the RH regenerants, which lost a fragment, an additional fragment was observed."

"24467344","abstracttext","Previously we identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) qTaLRO-B1 for primary root length (PRL) in wheat. Here we compare proteomics in the roots of the qTaLRO-B1 QTL isolines 178A, with short PRL and small meristem size, and 178B, with long PRL and large meristem size. A total of 16 differentially expressed proteins were identified: one, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta receptor-interacting protein-1 (TaTRIP1), was enriched in 178A, while various peroxidases (PODs) were more abundantly expressed in 178B. The 178A roots showed higher TaTRIP1 expression and lower levels of the unphosphorylated form of the brassinosteroid (BR) signaling component BZR1, lower expression of POD genes and reduced POD activity and accumulation of the superoxide anion O2(-) in the root elongation zone compared with the 178B roots. Low levels of 24-epibrassinolide increased POD gene expression and root meristem size, and rescued the short PRL phenotype of 178A. TaTRIP1 directly interacted with the BR receptor TaBRI1 of wheat. Moreover, overexpressing TaTRIP1 in Arabidopsis reduced the abundance of unphosphorylated BZR1 protein, altered the expression of BR-responsive genes, inhibited POD activity and accumulation of the O2(-) in the root tip and inhibited root meristem size. Our data suggested that TaTRIP1 is involved in BR signaling and inhibited root meristem size, possibly by reducing POD activity and accumulation of O2(-) in the root tip. We further demonstrated a negative correlation between the level of TaTRIP1 mRNA and PRL of landraces and modern wheat varieties, providing a valuable insight for better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the genotypic differences in root morphology of wheat in the future."

"24253118","abstracttext","Glutenin subunits from nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelocentric lines of the hexaploid wheat variety 'Chinese Spring' (CS) and from substitution lines of the durum wheat variety 'Langdon' were fractionated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) at 70 °C using a gradient of acetonitrile in the presence of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Nineteen subunits were detected in CS. The presence and amounts of four early-eluted subunits were found, through aneuploid analysis, to be controlled by the long arms of chromosomes 1D (1DL) (peaks 1-2) and 1B (1BL) (peaks 3-4). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that these four subunits are the high molecular weight subunits of glutenin, which elute in the order 1Dy, 1Dx, 1By, and 1Bx. Similar amounts of 1DL subunits were present (6.3 and 8.8% of total glutenin), but 1BL subunits differed more in abundance (5.4 and 9.5%, respectively). Results indicate that most late-eluting CS glutenin subunits were coded by structural genes on the short arms of homoeologous group 1 chromosomes: 6 by 1DS, 5 by 1AS, and 4 by 1BS. Glutenin of tetraploid 'Langdon' durum wheat separated into nine major subunits: 6 were coded by genes on 1B chromosomes, and 3 on 1A chromosomes. Gene locations for glutenin subunits in the tetraploid durum varieties 'Edmore' and 'Kharkovskaya-5' are also given. These results should make RP-HPLC a powerful tool for qualitative and quantitative genetic studies of wheat glutenin."

The genome and homoeologous group of the monosomic used in the cross affected the distribution of chromosome number of the progeny plants in the F2 and F4. Meiosis in the pollen mother cells of the B1F7 partial amphiploids was not stable, and not different from that of the B1F1 in which univalents and multivalents were observed. Disomic addition lines were selected on the basis of morphology and meiotic stability in the F2, F4 and F5. Eleven of the fourteen possible wheat-Th. distichum disomic addition lines were identified using chromosome C-band pattern, as well as size and arm ratio, as genetic markers. Addition of T. distichum chromosome J (dll) produced a phenotype indicating homoeology with wheat group-2 chromosomes. Clear indications of homoeology based on morphological characteristics were not obtained in any of the other addition lines, probably due to the mixed homoeology of the Th. distichum chromosomes relative to wheat. The addition lines were all susceptible to leaf rust, unlike the germplasm-line Indis which carries a leaf rust resistance gene on a translocation segment derived from Th. distichum. Instability of meiotic pairing was observed in all addition lines. The stability, or not, of progeny chromosome counts did not reflect the level of chromosome pairing instability in the parental plants. SDS-PAGE for gliadin-type seed proteins revealed two addition lines which expressed seed storage proteins uncommon to Inia 66 but typical of Th. distichum."

In these three groups, the frequency of inherited mutations causing the loss of all proteins controlled by a locus (null-mutations, probably caused by a chromosomal deficiency) was 0.69%, 2.07%, and 0.05% per locus (the differences were statistically significant), respectively, while that of mutations causing the loss of a single protein band was 0.11%, 0.33%, and 0.05%, respectively. The loss of all of the gliadins controlled by Gli-B1 or GH-B2 (mutations were probably caused by a deletion of satellites of the corresponding chromosomes), was significantly higher than the loss of gliadins controlled by genomes A and D. Gene mutations altering the electrophoretic mobility of a single protein band in the pattern were found only in the second group of plants (0.44%). Therefore, chemical mutagenesis which produced not only more mutations than cultivation of immature wheat embryos in vitro, but also a higher ratio of mutations that altered DNA sequences, can be considered as an easier and comparatively more promising way for obtaining new improved variants of loci controlling biochemical characteristics in wheat. Somaclonal variation, on the other hand, was probably mainly caused by chromosomal abnormalities and could therefore hardly be considered as a useful tool in wheat breeding."

"24595619","abstracttext","Using particle bombardment transformation, we introduced maize pepc cDNA encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) and ppdk cDNA encoding pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) into the C3 crop wheat to generate transgenic wheat lines carrying cDNA of pepc (PC lines), ppdk (PK lines) or both (PKC lines). The integration, transcription, and expression of the foreign genes were confirmed by Southern blot, Real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (Q-RT-PCR), and Western blot analysis. Q-RT-PCR results indicated that the average relative expression levels of pepc and ppdk in the PKC lines reached 10 and 4.6, respectively, compared to their expressions in untransformed plants (set to 1). The enzyme activities of PEPC and PPDK in the PKC lines were 4.3- and 2.1-fold higher, respectively, than in the untransformed control. The maximum daily net photosynthetic rates of the PKC, PC, and PK lines were enhanced by 26.4, 13.3, and 4.5%, respectively, whereas the diurnal accumulations of photosynthesis were 21.3, 13.9, and 6.9%, respectively, higher than in the control. The Fv/Fm of the transgenic plants decreased less than in the control under high temperature and high light conditions (2 weeks after anthesis), suggesting that the transgenic wheat transports more absorbed light energy into a photochemical reaction. The exogenous maize C4-specific pepc gene was more effective than ppdk at improving the photosynthetic performance and yield characteristics of transgenic wheat, while the two genes showed a synergistic effect when they were transformed into the same genetic background, because the PKC lines exhibited improved photosynthetic and physiological traits."

"26408103","abstracttext","Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides a powerful tool for the discovery of important genes and alleles in crop plants and their wild relatives. Despite great advances in NGS technologies, whole-genome shotgun sequencing is cost-prohibitive for species with complex genomes. An attractive option is to reduce genome complexity to a single chromosome prior to sequencing. This work describes a strategy for studying the genomes of distant wild relatives of wheat by isolating single chromosomes from addition or substitution lines, followed by chromosome sorting using flow cytometry and sequencing of chromosomal DNA by NGS technology. We flow-sorted chromosome 5M(g) from a wheat/Aegilops geniculata disomic substitution line [DS5M(g) (5D)] and sequenced it using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system at approximately 50 × coverage. Paired-end sequences were assembled and used for structural and functional annotation. A total of 4236 genes were annotated on 5M(g) , in close agreement with the predicted number of genes on wheat chromosome 5D (4286). Single-gene FISH indicated no major chromosomal rearrangements between chromosomes 5M(g) and 5D. Comparing chromosome 5M(g) with model grass genomes identified synteny blocks in Brachypodium distachyon, rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Chromosome 5M(g) -specific SNPs and cytogenetic probe-based resources were developed and validated. Deletion bin-mapped and ordered 5M(g) SNP markers will be useful to track 5M-specific introgressions and translocations. This study provides a detailed sequence-based analysis of the composition of a chromosome from a distant wild relative of bread wheat, and opens up opportunities to develop genomic resources for wild germplasm to facilitate crop improvement."

"26188588","abstracttext_key message","Two mapping approaches were use to identify and validate milling and baking quality QTL in soft wheat. Two LG were consistently found important for multiple traits and we recommend the use marker-assisted selection on specific markers reported here. Wheat-derived food products require a range of characteristics. Identification and understanding of the genetic components controlling end-use quality of wheat is important for crop improvement. We assessed the underlying genetics controlling specific milling and baking quality parameters of soft wheat including flour yield, softness equivalent, flour protein, sucrose, sodium carbonate, water absorption and lactic acid, solvent retention capacities in a diversity panel and five bi-parental mapping populations. The populations were genotyped with SSR and DArT markers, with markers specific for the 1BL.1RS translocation and sucrose synthase gene. Association analysis and composite interval mapping were performed to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL). High heritability was observed for each of the traits evaluated, trait correlations were consistent over populations, and transgressive segregants were common in all bi-parental populations. A total of 26 regions were identified as potential QTL in the diversity panel and 74 QTL were identified across all five bi-parental mapping populations. Collinearity of QTL from chromosomes 1B and 2B was observed across mapping populations and was consistent with results from the association analysis in the diversity panel. Multiple regression analysis showed the importance of the two 1B and 2B regions and marker-assisted selection for the favorable alleles at these regions should improve quality."

"25875107","abstracttext","Take-all, which is caused by the fungal pathogen, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici (Ggt), is an important soil-borne root rot disease of wheat occurring worldwide. However, the genetic basis of Ggt pathogenicity remains unclear. In this study, transcriptome sequencing for Ggt in axenic culture and Ggt-infected wheat roots was performed using Illumina paired-end sequencing. Approximately 2.62 and 7.76 Gb of clean reads were obtained, and 87% and 63% of the total reads were mapped to the Ggt genome for RNA extracted from Ggt in culture and infected roots, respectively. A total of 3,258 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified with 2,107 (65%) being 2-fold up-regulated and 1,151 (35%) being 2-fold down-regulated between Ggt in culture and Ggt in infected wheat roots. Annotation of these DEGs revealed that many were associated with possible Ggt pathogenicity factors, such as genes for guanine nucleotide-binding protein alpha-2 subunit, cellulase, pectinase, xylanase, glucosidase, aspartic protease and gentisate 1, 2-dioxygenase. Twelve DEGs were analyzed for expression by qRT-PCR, and could be generally divided into those with high expression only early in infection, only late in infection and those that gradually increasing expression over time as root rot developed. This indicates that these possible pathogenicity factors may play roles during different stages of the interaction, such as signaling, plant cell wall degradation and responses to plant defense compounds. This is the first study to compare the transcriptomes of Ggt growing saprophytically in axenic cultures to it growing parasitically in infected wheat roots. As a result, new candidate pathogenicity factors have been identified, which can be further examined by gene knock-outs and other methods to assess their true role in the ability of Ggt to infect roots."
"26225424","articletitle","Rapidly Evolving Genes Are Key Players in Host Specialization and Virulence of the Fungal Wheat Pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (Mycosphaerella graminicola)."
"26225424","abstracttext","The speciation of pathogens can be driven by divergent host specialization. Specialization to a new host is possible via the acquisition of advantageous mutations fixed by positive selection. Comparative genome analyses of closely related species allows for the identification of such key substitutions via inference of genome-wide signatures of positive selection. We previously used a comparative genomics framework to identify genes that have evolved under positive selection during speciation of the prominent wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici (synonym Mycosphaerella graminicola). In this study, we conducted functional analyses of four genes exhibiting strong signatures of positive selection in Z. tritici. We deleted the four genes in Z. tritici and confirm a virulence-related role of three of the four genes ΔZt80707, ΔZt89160 and ΔZt103264. The two mutants ΔZt80707 and ΔZt103264 show a significant reduction in virulence during infection of wheat; the ΔZt89160 mutant causes a hypervirulent phenotype in wheat. Mutant phenotypes of ΔZt80707, ΔZt89160 and ΔZt103264 can be restored by insertion of the wild-type genes. However, the insertion of the Zt80707 and Zt89160 orthologs from Z. pseudotritici and Z. ardabiliae do not restore wild-type levels of virulence, suggesting that positively selected substitutions in Z. tritici may relate to divergent host specialization. Interestingly, the gene Zt80707 encodes also a secretion signal that targets the protein for cell secretion. This secretion signal is however only transcribed in Z. tritici, suggesting that Z. tritici-specific substitutions relate to a new function of the protein in the extracellular space of the wheat-Z. tritici interaction. Together, the results presented here highlight that Zt80707, Zt103264 and Zt89160 represent key genes involved in virulence and host-specific disease development of Z. tritici. Our findings illustrate that evolutionary predictions provide a powerful tool for the identification of novel traits crucial for host adaptation and pathogen evolution."
"25344655","articletitle","Role of glycine in improving the ionic and ROS homeostasis during NaCl stress in wheat."
"25344655","abstracttext","Nine-day-old wheat seedlings were treated with NaCl at 75, 150, and 225 mM for 15 days in the absence or presence of 5 mM glycine. NaCl particularly at 150 and 225 mM led to significant reductions in fresh and dry weights, chlorophylls, carotenoids, Ca(2+), K(+), and K(+)/Na(+) ratio. Contrarily, there were significant accumulations in Na(+), malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2, soluble sugars, and proline concomitant with inhibitions in enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants and in Rubisco. In the meantime, the transcript level of alternative oxidase (AOX) was highly upregulated by NaCl; the upregulation was greatest with the lowest concentration. However, the transcript level of H(+)/Na(+) antiporter exchanger (NHX1) was decreased by 75 and 150 mM NaCl but increased by 225 mM. Similarly, the transcript level of salt overly sensitive 1 (SOS1) was upregulated by only 225 mM. Nonetheless, the application of glycine mostly overcame the varied impacts of NaCl on growth, MDA, H2O2, pigments, metabolites, and elements. Moreover, glycine elevated enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidants to reach most likely the levels of the respective control. On the contrary, much induction was detected in Rubisco. The transcript levels of AOX, NHX1, and SOS1 were further upregulated; the upregulation of AOX was most pronounced with the highest NaCl concentration in the presence of glycine and only with 75 and 150 mM NaCl for NHX1 and SOS1. The increase in antioxidants concomitant with the decrease in MDA and H2O2 reveals that ROS scavenging system became more efficient in NaCl-treated wheat following glycine application, concluding that glycine could ameliorate wheat tolerance to salinity. Moreover, lowering Na(+) by glycine and mitigation of the decreased K(+)/Na(+) ratio synchronous with recovery in growth reduction and stimulation of AOX, NHX1 and SOS1 may emphasize the role of glycine in stimulating gene expression for raising wheat tolerance to NaCl."
"25288939","articletitle","Take-all of Wheat and Natural Disease Suppression: A Review."
"25288939","abstracttext","In agro-ecosystems worldwide, some of the most important and devastating diseases are caused by soil-borne necrotrophic fungal pathogens, against which crop plants generally lack genetic resistance. However, plants have evolved approaches to protect themselves against pathogens by stimulating and supporting specific groups of beneficial microorganisms that have the ability to protect either by direct inhibition of the pathogen or by inducing resistance mechanisms in the plant. One of the best examples of protection of plant roots by antagonistic microbes occurs in soils that are suppressive to take-all disease of wheat. Take-all, caused by Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, is the most economically important root disease of wheat worldwide. Take-all decline (TAD) is the spontaneous decline in incidence and severity of disease after a severe outbreak of take-all during continuous wheat or barley monoculture. TAD occurs worldwide, and in the United States and The Netherlands it results from a build-up of populations of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (2,4-DAPG)-producing fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. during wheat monoculture. The antibiotic 2,4-DAPG has a broad spectrum of activity and is especially active against the take-all pathogen. Based on genotype analysis by repetitive sequence-based-PCR analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism of phlD, a key 2,4-DAPG biosynthesis gene, at least 22 genotypes of 2,4-DAPG producing fluorescent Pseudomonas spp. have been described worldwide. In this review, we provide an overview of G. graminis var. tritici, the take-all disease, Pseudomonas biocontrol agents, and mechanism of disease suppression."

"25242885","abstracttext","Vernalization, photoperiod and the relatively poorly defined earliness per se ( eps ) genes regulate flowering in plants. We report here the validation of a major eps quantitative trait locus (QTL) located on wheat 1DL using near isogenic lines (NILs). We used four independent pairs of NILs derived from a cross between Spark and Rialto winter wheat varieties, grown in both the field and controlled environments. NILs carrying the Spark allele, defined by QTL flanking markers Xgdm111 and Xbarc62 , consistently flowered 3-5 days earlier when fully vernalized relative to those with the Rialto. The effect was independent of photoperiod under field conditions, short days (10-h light), long days (16-h light) and very long days (20-h light). These results validate our original QTL identified using doubled haploid (DH) populations. This QTL represents variation maintained in elite north-western European winter wheat germplasm. The two DH lines used to develop the NILs, SR9 and SR23 enabled us to define the location of the 1DL QTL downstream of marker Xgdm111 . SR9 has the Spark 1DL arm while SR23 has a recombinant 1DL arm with the Spark allele from Xgdm111 to the distal end. Our work suggests that marker assisted selection of eps effects is feasible and useful even before the genes are cloned. This means eps genes can be defined and positionally cloned in the same way as the photoperiod and vernalization genes have been. This validation study is a first step towards fine mapping and eventually cloning the gene directly in hexaploid wheat."

"25940960","abstracttext","Drought tolerance of the wheat cultivar Bobwhite was previously enhanced by transformation with a construct containing the wheat DREB3 gene driven by the stress-inducible maize Rab17 promoter. Progeny of a single T2 transgenic line were used as pollinators in crosses with four elite bread wheat cultivars from Western Australia: Bonnie Rock, IGW-2971, Magenta and Wyalkatchem, with the aim of evaluating transgene performance in different genetic backgrounds. The selected pollinator line, BW8-9-10-3, contained multiple transgene copies, had significantly improved drought tolerance compared with wild-type plants and showed no growth and development penalties or abnormalities. A single hybrid plant was selected from each cross-combination for three rounds of backcrossing with the corresponding maternal wheat cultivar. The transgene was detected in all four F1 BC3 combinations, but stress-inducible transgene expression was found in only three of the four combinations. Under well-watered conditions, the phenotypes and grain yield components of the F2 BC3 transgene-expressing lines were similar to those of corresponding recurrent parents and null-segregants. Under severe drought conditions, the backcross lines demonstrated 12-18% higher survival rates than the corresponding control plants. Two from four F3 BC3 transgenic lines showed significantly higher yield (18.9% and 21.5%) than control plants under limited water conditions. There was no induction of transgene expression under cold stress, and therefore, no improvement of frost tolerance observed in the progenies of drought-tolerant F3 BC3 lines."

"26232919","abstracttext_main conclusion","This genetic map for Agropyron Gaertn. contained 1023 markers on seven linkage groups, with a total of 907.8 cM and an average distance of 1.5 cM between adjacent loci. Many wheat- Agropyron cristatum derivative lines exhibit superior agronomic traits, and part of them are valuable for future wheat breeding. To date, no high-density genetic map for Agropyron Gaertn. has been published. Specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq), a recently developed strategy for large scale de novo discovery and genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), was employed in this study to develop sufficient markers for a segregating Agropyron F1 population derived from an interspecific cross between two cross-pollinated diploid collections A. cristatum (L.) Beauv. 'Z1842' and A. mongolicum Keng 'Z2098'. In total, we obtained raw data consisting of 128,932,358 pair-end reads of ~80 bp long after sequencing. Then 69,325 high-quality SLAFs were detected, of which 26,248 SLAFs were polymorphic and 1752 of the polymorphic markers were used for the genetic map construction. The final map contained 1023 markers on the seven linkage groups (LGs), which spanned a total of 907.8 cM with an average number of 146 markers and 89 loci per LG and an average distance of 1.5 cM between adjacent loci. To our knowledge, this map is the densest genetic linkage map for Agropyron so far. Through BLAT alignment of Agropyron SLAF marker sequences with the draft genome assemblies of wheat and barley, the Agropyron LGs were assigned as LG1-7 according to their corresponding homoeologous chromosomal groups of wheat. Results of this study will not only provide a platform for gene/QTL fine mapping, but also serve as a reference to assist the assembling of the P genome sequence in future."

"26072571","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) during wet and cool harvest periods remains a serious problem in the production of cereals like barley, wheat and triticale. Being involved in dormancy induction and maintenance during seed development, abscisic acid (ABA) may play a key role to improve dormancy level and hence PHS-tolerance in these grains. In this study, we investigated the ABA levels and expression profiles of ABA biosynthesis and degradation genes during kernel development to explore the potential of these genes for improving PHS-tolerance in wheat and triticale. Plants of a PHS-tolerant and a PHS-susceptible variety of both wheat and triticale were grown under controlled conditions from flowering to harvest. At regular time points, kernels were harvested for ABA analysis and RNA extraction. RNA extracts were used in an RT-qPCR assay to obtain expression profiles of the ABA synthesis genes ZEP, NCED1 and NCED2 and the ABA degradation genes CYP707A1 and CYP707A2. In contrast to reports in Arabidopsis, the ZEP gene was predominantly expressed towards harvest maturity in both wheat and triticale. NCED1 expression coincided well with the observed ABA levels during kernel development, while NCED2 expression was mainly detected in early development, indicating a potential role for dormancy induction. ABA degradation towards harvest maturity was mainly associated with increased CYP707A1 expression, whereas CYP707A2 expression appeared to correlate with the regulation of ABA levels during kernel development. However, no differential expression of the investigated genes was detected between PHS-tolerant and PHS-susceptible varieties."

"26432666","abstracttext","By accelerating crop development, warming climates may result in mismatches between key sensitive growth stages and extreme climate events, with severe consequences for crop yield and food security. Using recent estimates of gene responses to vernalization and photoperiod in wheat, we modelled the flowering times of all 'potential' genotypes as influenced by the velocity of climate change across the Australian wheatbelt. In the period 1957-2010, seasonal increases in temperature of 0.012 °C yr(-1) were recorded and changed flowering time of a mid-season wheat genotype by an average -0.074 day yr(-1) , with flowering 'velocity' of up to 0.95 km yr(-1) towards the coastal edges of the wheatbelt; this is an estimate of how quickly the given genotype would have to be 'moved' across the landscape to maintain its original flowering time. By 2030, these national changes are projected to accelerate by up to 3-fold for seasonal temperature and by up to 5-fold for flowering time between now and 2030, with average national shifts in flowering time of 0.33 and 0.41 day yr(-1) between baseline and the worst climate scenario tested for 2030 and 2050, respectively. Without new flowering alleles in commercial germplasm, the life cycle of wheat crops is predicted to shorten by 2 weeks by 2030 across the wheatbelt for the most pessimistic climate scenario. While current cultivars may be otherwise suitable for future conditions, they will flower earlier due to warmer temperatures. To allow earlier sowing to escape frost, heat and terminal drought, and to maintain current growing period of early-sown wheat crops in the future, breeders will need to develop and/or introduce new genetic sources for later flowering, more so in the eastern part of the wheatbelt."

"26551448","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, the causal agent of wheat stripe rust, frequently produces new races overcoming resistance in wheat cultivars. A recently identified race, V26 with virulence to Yr26 and many other stripe rust resistance genes, has a high potential to cause epidemics in China. In this study, teliospores from a single-urediniospore isolate of V26 (Pinglan 17-7) produced on the wheat line 92R137 (Yr26) were used to produce a sexual population through selfing by infecting Berberis shensiana plants under controlled conditions. One hundred and eighteen progeny isolates and the parental isolate were phenotyped for virulence/avirulence on 24 Yr gene lines of wheat. These progeny isolates were all avirulent to Yr5, Yr8, Yr15, and YrTr1 and virulent to Yr1, Yr2, Yr7, Yr9, Yr10, Yr17, Yr24, Yr25, Yr26, YrA, YrExp2, and YrV23, indicating that the parental isolate is homozygous avirulent or homozygous virulent at these loci. The progeny population segregated for avirulence to Yr6, Yr43, and YrSP at one locus (3 avirulent:1 virulent ratio); for virulence to Yr27 and Yr28 at one locus (3 virulent:1 avirulent); and for Yr4, Yr32, and Yr44 at two loci (15 virulent:1 avirulent). Among the eight segregating avirulence/virulence loci, association was found between virulence to Yr4 and Yr32, as well as between virulence to Yr6 and Yr43 based on χ(2) tests. From 82 genotypically different progeny isolates, 24 pathotypes and 82 multilocus genotypes were identified. The results show that a highly diverse population can be produced from a single isolate by selfing on a barberry plant and sexually produced population can be used to genetically characterize virulence of the stripe rust pathogen."

Its biochemical stability and great hydrolysis efficiency against complex biomass make it a potential candidate for the production of biofuels."
"26628911","abstracttext_results","The gene encoding Ac-Abf51A was cloned. The comparison of its sequence with reference proteins having resolved 3D-structures revealed nine key residues involved in catalysis and substrate-binding interaction. Recombinant Ac-Abf51A produced in Escherichia coli showed optimal activity at pH 6.0 and 60 °C with 4-nitrophenyl-α-l-arabinofuranoside as the substrate. The enzyme exhibited an exo-type mode of action on polyarabinosides by catalyzing the cleavage of α-1,2- and α-1,3-linked arabinofuranose side chains in sugar beet arabinan and water-soluble wheat arabinoxylan and α-1,5-linked arabinofuranosidic bonds in debranched sugar beet arabinan.

Moreover, Ac-Abf51A showed greater synergistic effect in combination with xylanase (2.92-fold) on wheat arabinoxylan degradation than other reported enzymes, for the amounts of arabinose, xylose, and xylobiose were all increased in comparison to that by the enzymes acting individually."

The distinguished synergy might be ascribed to its bifunctional α-l-arabinofuranosidase/xylanase activity, which may represent a possible way to degrade biomass at lower enzyme loadings."

"27014327","abstracttext","The extensive use of two alleles (Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b) at the Rht-1 locus in wheat allowed dramatic increases in yields, triggering the so-called ""Green Revolution."" Here, we found that a new natural allelic variation (Rht-B1i) containing a single missense SNP (A614G) in the coding region significantly increased plant height against the genetic background of both Rht-D1a (11.68%) and Rht-D1b (7.89%). To elucidate the molecular mechanism of Rht-B1i, we investigated the promoter region. Sequence analysis showed that the Rht-B1i promoter could be divided into two classes depending on the presence or absence of a specific 160 bp insertion: Rht-B1i-1 (with the 160 bp insertion) and Rht-B1i-2 (without the 160 bp insertion). The promoter of Rht-B1i-1 contained 32 more possible cis-acting elements than Rht-B1a, including a unique auxin response element AUXREPSIAA4. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis indicated that the 160 bp insertion is likely to promote the transcription of the Rht-B1i-1 gene. The coleoptile lengths of wheat varieties treated with IAA, GA3, and IAA/GA3, combined with the histochemical staining of transgenic Arabidopsis containing the Rht-B1i-1 promoter, showed that the height-increasing effect of Rht-B1i-1 may be due to the synergistic action of IAA and GA3. These results augment our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of Rht-1 in wheat and provide new genetic resources for wheat improvement."

Earlier studies hypothesized that resistance affecting the degree of host damage, as measured by the percentage of leaf area covered by STB lesions, is distinct from resistance that affects pathogen reproduction, as measured by the density of pycnidia produced within lesions. We tested this hypothesis using a collection of 335 elite European winter wheat cultivars that was naturally infected by a diverse population of Zymoseptoria tritici in a replicated field experiment. We used automated image analysis of 21,420 scanned wheat leaves to obtain quantitative measures of conditional STB intensity that were precise, objective, and reproducible. These measures allowed us to explicitly separate resistance affecting host damage from resistance affecting pathogen reproduction, enabling us to confirm that these resistance traits are largely independent. The cultivar rankings based on host damage were different from the rankings based on pathogen reproduction, indicating that the two forms of resistance should be considered separately in breeding programs aiming to increase STB resistance. We hypothesize that these different forms of resistance are under separate genetic control, enabling them to be recombined to form new cultivars that are highly resistant to STB. We found a significant correlation between rankings based on automated image analysis and rankings based on traditional visual scoring, suggesting that image analysis can complement conventional measurements of STB resistance, based largely on host damage, while enabling a much more precise measure of pathogen reproduction. We showed that measures of pathogen reproduction early in the growing season were the best predictors of host damage late in the growing season, illustrating the importance of breeding for resistance that reduces pathogen reproduction in order to minimize yield losses caused by STB. These data can already be used by breeding programs to choose wheat cultivars that are broadly resistant to naturally diverse Z. tritici populations according to the different classes of resistance."

"29118820","abstracttext_background","Wheat is one of the most widely grown crop in temperate climates for food and animal feed. In order to meet the demands of the predicted population increase in an ever-changing climate, wheat production needs to dramatically increase. Spike and grain traits are critical determinants of final yield and grain uniformity a commercially desired trait, but their analysis is laborious and often requires destructive harvest. One of the current challenges is to develop an accurate, non-destructive method for spike and grain trait analysis capable of handling large populations."
"29118820","abstracttext_results","In this study we describe the development of a robust method for the accurate extraction and measurement of spike and grain morphometric parameters from images acquired by X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT). The image analysis pipeline developed automatically identifies plant material of interest in μCT images, performs image analysis, and extracts morphometric data. As a proof of principle, this integrated methodology was used to analyse the spikes from a population of wheat plants subjected to high temperatures under two different water regimes. Temperature has a negative effect on spike height and grain number with the middle of the spike being the most affected region. The data also confirmed that increased grain volume was correlated with the decrease in grain number under mild stress."
"29118820","abstracttext_conclusions","Being able to quickly measure plant phenotypes in a non-destructive manner is crucial to advance our understanding of gene function and the effects of the environment. We report on the development of an image analysis pipeline capable of accurately and reliably extracting spike and grain traits from crops without the loss of positional information. This methodology was applied to the analysis of wheat spikes can be readily applied to other economically important crop species."

"28511351","abstracttext","Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is an important process in many marine and paddy ecosystems. However, few studies have reported on the contribution to the nitrogen cycle of anammox and its dynamics in rice-wheat cropping systems with different fertilization regimes. Here, isotope tracing and molecular techniques were used to determine the potential rates of anammox and their association with bacterial abundance, diversity, and activity. Rice-wheat cropping systems at two sites in Jiangsu Province, China were selected and the treatments at each site were: 1) no fertilization (CK), 2) 100% chemical fertilization (CF), 3) pig manure compost plus 50% chemical fertilization (PMCF), and 4) straw plus 100% chemical fertilization (SRCF). The results revealed that anammox bacteria with high abundance were detected in both the wheat and rice seasons. The abundance of anammox in PMCF treatment was higher than that in SRCF treatment in both Changshu and Jintan. Moreover, the abundance of anammox bacteria in CF treatment was significantly higher than that in CK in Changshu. Analysis of anammox hydrazine synthase β subunit (hzs-β) gene sequences showed that in the rice season, the anammox bacteria Ca. Brocadia, Ca. Scalindua, and Ca. Jettenia were present. In contrast, all of the anammox hydrazine oxidase (hzo) genes were affiliated with Ca. Brocadia, suggesting that hzs genes are more representative of anammox biological diversity compared to hzo. Sequences from the PMCF treatment where affiliated with both Ca. Jettenia and Ca. Brocadia, and showed the highest diversity. Anammox activity was detected in both the wheat and rice seasons, but there were significant differences between seasons. The anammox rates were in the range 0.34 to 1.04nmol dinitrogen gas∙g -1 dry soil∙h -1 , and 3.15 to 9.62% of dinitrogen gas emissions were attributed to anammox. However, no significant difference among the fertilizer treatments for anammox activity was found in the study."

"27744264","abstracttext","The genome of Fusarium graminearum, a necrotrophic fungal pathogen causing Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease of wheat, barley and other cereal grains, contains five genes putatively encoding for proteins with a cerato-platanin domain. Cerato-platanins are small secreted cysteine-rich proteins possibly localized in the fungal cell walls and also contributing to the virulence. Two of these F. graminearum proteins (FgCPP1 and FgCPP2) belong to the class of SnodProt proteins which exhibit phytotoxic activity in the fungal pathogens Botrytis cinerea and Magnaporthe grisea. In order to verify their contribution during plant infection and fungal growth, single and double gene knock-out mutants were produced and no reduction in symptoms severity was observed compared to the wild type strain on both soybean and wheat spikes. Histological analysis performed by fluorescence microscopy on wheat spikelets infected with mutants constitutively expressing the dsRed confirmed that FgCPPs do not contribute to fungal virulence. In particular, the formation of compound appressoria on wheat paleas was unchanged. Looking for other functions of these proteins, the double mutant was characterized by in vitro experiments. The mutant was inhibited by salt and H 2 O 2 stress similarly to wild type. Though no growth difference was observed on glucose, the mutant grew better than wild type on carboxymethyl cellulose. Additionally, the mutant's mycelium was more affected by treatments with chitinase and β-1,3-glucanase, thus indicating that FgCPPs could protect fungal cell wall polysaccharides from enzymatic degradation."

"27795677","abstracttext","Aegilops variabilis (UUS v S v ), an important sources for wheat improvement, originated from chromosome doubling of a natural hybrid between Ae. umbellulata (UU) with Ae. longissima (S l S l ). The Ae. variabilis karyotype was poorly characterized by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). The FISH probe combination of pSc119.2, pTa71 and pTa-713 identified each of the 14 pairs of Ae. variabilis chromosomes. Our FISH ideogram was further used to detect an Ae. variabilis chromosome carrying stripe rust resistance in the background of wheat lines developed from crosses of the stripe rust susceptible bread wheat cultivar Yiyuan 2 with a resistant Ae. variabilis accession. Among the 15 resistant BC 1 F 7 lines, three were 2S v + 4S v addition lines (2n = 46) and 12 were 2S v (2B) or 2S v (2D) substitution lines that were confirmed with SSR markers. SSR marker gwm148 can be used to trace 2S v in common wheat background. Chromosome 2S v probably carries gametocidal( Gc ) gene(s) since cytological instability and chromosome structural variations, including non-homologous translocations, were observed in some lines with this chromosome. Due to the effects of photoperiod genes, substitution lines 2S v (2D) and 2S v (2B) exhibited late heading with 2S v (2D) lines being later than 2S v (2B) lines. 2S v (2D) substitution lines were also taller and exhibited higher spikelet numbers and longer spikes."
"27665367","articletitle","The eyespot resistance genes Pch1 and Pch2 of wheat are not homoeoloci."
"27665367","abstracttext_key message","Phenotyping and mapping data reveal that chromosome intervals containing eyespot resistance genes Pch1 and Pch2 on 7D and 7A, respectively, do not overlap, and thus, these genes are not homoeloci. Eyespot is a stem-base fungal disease of cereals growing in temperate regions. Two main resistances are currently available for use in wheat. Pch1 is a potent single major gene transferred to wheat from Aegilops ventricosa and located on the distal end of chromosome 7D. Pch2, a moderate resistance deriving from Cappelle Desprez, is located at the end of 7AL. The relative positions of Pch1 and Pch2 on 7D and 7A, respectively, suggest that they are homoeoloci. A single seed decent recombinant F7 population was used to refine the position of Pch2 on 7A. New markers designed to 7D also allowed the position of Pch1 to be further defined. We exploited the syntenic relationship between Brachypodium distachyon and wheat to develop 7A and 7D specific KASP markers tagging inter-varietal and interspecific SNPs and allow the comparison of the relative positions of Pch1 and Pch2 on 7D and 7A. Together, phenotyping and mapping data reveal that the intervals containing Pch1 and Pch2 do not overlap, and thus, they cannot be considered homoeloci. Using this information, we analysed two durum wheat lines carrying Pch1 on 7A to determine whether the Ae.ventricosa introgression extended into the region associated with Pch2. This identified that the introgression is distal to Pch2 on 7A, providing further evidence that the genes are not homoeoloci. However, it is feasible to use this material to pyramid Pch1 and Pch2 on 7A in a tetraploid background and also to increase the copy number of Pch1 in combination with Pch2 in a hexaploid background."

Efforts to develop effective resistance to this disease have been hampered by the quantitative nature of resistance and a lack of understanding of the factors associated with resistance and susceptibility. Here, we aimed to dissect transcriptional responses triggered in wheat by F. pseudograminearum infection."

A number of genes encoding pathogen-responsive uridine-diphosphate glycosyltransferases (UGTs) potentially involved in detoxification of the Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) were differentially expressed. Using a F. pseudograminearum DON-non-producing mutant, DON was shown to play an important role in virulence during Fusarium crown rot.

Additional functional analyses of candidate genes should reveal their roles in disease resistance or susceptibility. Better understanding of host responses contributing to resistance and/or susceptibility will aid the development of future disease improvement strategies against this important plant pathogen."
"28109774","articletitle","A tomatinase-like enzyme acts as a virulence factor in the wheat pathogen Fusarium graminearum."
"28109774","abstracttext","During their interactions with plants, fungal pathogens employ large numbers of pathogenesis-associated molecules including secreted effectors and enzymes that can degrade various defence compounds. However, in many cases, in planta targets of pathogen-produced enzymes remain unknown. We identified a gene in the wheat pathogen Fusarium graminearum, encoding a putative enzyme that shows 84% sequence identity to FoTom1, a tomatinase produced by the tomato pathogen Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici. In F. oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici, FoTom1 is a virulence factor involved in the degradation of tomato defence compound tomatine, a saponin compound. Given that wheat is unknown to produce tomatine, we tested the ability of F. graminearum to degrade tomatine and found that F. graminearum was unable to degrade tomatine in culture. However, FgTom1 degraded tomatine in vitro when heterologously expressed. To determine the possible function of FgTom1 in pathogen virulence, we generated FgTom1 knockout mutants (ΔTom1). ΔTom1 mutants were not different from wild type when grown in culture but showed significant reduction in pathogen virulence in root rot and head blight assays. In an attempt to identify possible in planta targets of FgTom1, the metabolomes of wheat heads infected with wildtype pathogen and ΔTom1 were compared and several peaks differentially abundant between treatments identified. Although the exact identity of these peaks is currently unknown, this result suggested that FgTom1 may have in planta targets in wheat, possibly tomatine-like saponin compounds. Overall, our results presented here show that FgTom1 is a new virulence factor in F. graminearum."

"27936160","abstracttext","In plants, the CBL-CIPK signaling pathways play key roles in the response to abiotic stresses. However, functional studies of CIPKs in the important staple crop wheat are very rare. In this study, we identified a CIPK gene from wheat, designated TaCIPK2. Expression analysis results showed that TaCIPK2 could be up-regulated in wheat leaves by polyethylene glycol, abscisic acid and H2O2 treatments. Subcellular localization analyses revealed that TaCIPK2 was present in whole wheat epidermal cells. A yeast two-hybrid assay indicated that TaCIPK2 interacted with TaCBL1, 2, 3 and 4 in vitro. Transgenic tobacco plants over-expressing TaCIPK2 exhibited increased drought tolerance, indicated by a larger proportion of green cotyledons and higher survival rates under the osmotic and drought stress conditions compared with control plants. Additionally, physiological index analyses revealed that the transgenic tobacco plants had lower water loss rates and ion leakage, accumulated less malondialdehyde and H2O2, and had higher catalase and superoxide dismutase activities than the control plants. The transgenic plants also exhibited faster stomatal closure following exposure to osmotic stress conditions. The seed germination rates and stomatal aperture of TaCIPK2-overexpressing tobacco plants decreased after exogenous abscisic acid treatment was applied, implying that the transgenic tobacco plants were more sensitive to exogenous abscisic acid than the control plants. Our results indicate that TaCIPK2 plays a positive regulatory role in drought stress responses in transgenic tobacco plants."

"29228046","abstracttext","Herbicides are an important component of weed management in wheat, particularly in the southeastern US where weeds actively compete with wheat throughout the winter for nutrients and reduce tillering and ultimately the yield of the crop. Some wheat varieties are sensitive to metribuzin, a low-cost non-selective herbicide, leading to leaf chlorosis, stand loss, and decreased yield. Knowledge of the genetics of herbicide tolerance in wheat is very limited and most new varieties have not been screened for metribuzin tolerance. The identification of genes associated with metribuzin tolerance will lead to the development of molecular markers for use in screening breeding lines for metribuzin tolerance. AGS 2035 and AGS 2060 were identified as resistant and sensitive to metribuzin in several previous field screening experiments as well as controlled condition screening of nine varieties in the present study. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling of the genes in AGS 2035 and AGS 2060 through microarray analysis identified 169 and 127 genes to be significantly (2-fold, P>0.01) up- and down-regulated, respectively in response to metribuzin. Functional annotation revealed that genes involved in cell wall biosynthesis, photosynthesis and sucrose metabolism were highly responsive to metribuzin application. (Semi)quantitative RT-PCR of seven selected differentially expressed genes (DEGs) indicated that a gene coding for alkaline alpha-galactosidase 2 (AAG2) was specifically expressed in resistant varieties only after one and two weeks of metribuzin application. Integration of the DEGs into our ongoing mapping effort and identification of the genes within the QTL region showing significant association with resistance in future will aid in development of functional markers for metribuzin resistance."

"28392309","abstracttext","Little information is available on whether or not the effect of an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor on the prevention of ruminal acidosis is influenced by the type of diet during ruminant feeding. This study was conducted to explore the effect of acarbose addition on the prevention of severe subacute ruminal acidosis induced by either cracked wheat or beet pulp in vitro. Cracked wheat and beet pulp were fermented in vitro by rumen microorganisms obtained from three dairy cows. When cracked wheat was used as the substrate and fermented for 24 h, compared with the control, acarbose addition decreased the concentrations of acetate, propionate, butyrate, total volatile fatty acids, and lactate (P < 0.05), while linearly increased the ratio of acetate to propionate, pH value, and the ammonia-nitrogen level (P < 0.05). Applying Illumina MiSeq sequencing of a fragment of the 16S rRNA gene revealed that the relative abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes as well as the ACE (abundance-based coverage estimator) value, Chao 1 value, and Shannon index increased significantly (P < 0.05), while there was a significant reduction (P < 0.05) in the relative abundance of Tenericutes as well as Proteobacteria after adding acarbose compared to the control. On the other hand, when beet pulp was used as the substrate, acarbose addition had no significant effects (P > 0.05) on the fermentation parameters and the Chao 1 value, the Shannon index, and the proportion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. In general, these findings indicate that acarbose had more effects on ruminal fermentation when wheat was used as the substrate, whereas it exhibited little effect on ruminal fermentation when beet pulp was used as the substrate."

"28747234","abstracttext","The wheat dwarf disease is among the most damaging diseases in cereals. Its aetiological agent is the Wheat dwarf virus (WDV), which is exclusively transmitted from plant to plant by leafhoppers from the genus Psammotettix (Hemiptera, Cicadellidae). The parameters linked to the WDV/Psammotettix pathosystem are still poorly understood. We studied Psammotettix individuals collected in wheat and barley fields in France and, as a comparison, from grassland at agroecological interface in West Slovenia. Species identity of males and females has been determined using multiple criteria. In the first step, the characterization of the collected individuals included recordings of vibrational signals used in mating behaviour and morphometric analyses. In addition, a 442 nt sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome oxydase I (COI) gene was obtained for some individuals and compared to COI sequences of the Psammotettix leafhoppers available in public databases. In the cereal fields in France, P sammotettix alienus was the most numerous species; however, it sometimes occurred together with Psammotettix confinis, while in the grasslands in Slovenia, the third syntopic species in Psammotettix community was Psammotettix helvolus. The temporal parameters of the P. alienus male calling song that were measured in this study were very similar to those measured in a previous study. The local biotic and/or abiotic parameters most likely influence the life history of Psammotettix leafhoppers, and the proportion of viruliferous individuals collected in cereal fields was 14.9%, while leafhoppers collected in Slovenia were virus-free. Taken together, results show that more detailed information on population structure of Psammotettix leafhoppers is crucial for providing an insight into the epidemiology of wheat dwarf disease."

"29708983","abstracttext","Two experiments (pot and field experiments) were conducted in two consecutive years to evaluate the protective effects of botanical-chemical formulations on physiological, biochemical performance and grain yield of wheat inoculated with Bipolaris sorokiniana. We compared different formulations comprising Calotropis procera, Jacaranda mimosifolia, Thevetia peruviana extracts, chemical fungicide (mefenoxam) and salicylic acid to modulate the defense system of wheat host plants. Among the selected plant species J. mimosifolia aqueous and methanolic leaf extracts (1.2% w/v) resulted in 96 to 97% inhibition against B. sorokiniana. Both in pot and field experiments, among all the formulations of selected plant extracts the combined formulation of JAF2 (J. mimosifolia 0.6%)+MFF2 (mefenoxam 0.1%) lowered the dose of chemical fungicide required to reduce the leaf spot blotch disease. The same formulation induced resistance in wheat apparently through the accumulation of peroxidase, polyphenol oxidase, protease, acid invertase, chitinase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase. This formulation also stimulated the defense-related gene expression of PR-proteins. The same treatment gave even more increase (48%, 12% and 22%) in no. of grains/spike, grains weight and grain yield, than the MFF1 (mefenoxam 0.2%). We conclude that foliar application of J. mimosifolia leaf extract with very low dose of chemical fungicide (J. mimosifolia 0.6%+mefenoxam 0.1%) is a promising approach for the management of leaf blight and spot blotch in wheat."

"29101627","abstracttext","Aegilops tauschii, a wild wheat relative, is the D-genome donor of common wheat. Subspecies and varieties of Ae. tauschii are traditionally classified based on differences in their inflorescence architecture. However, the genetic information for their diversification has been quite limited in the wild wheat relatives. The variety anathera has no awn on the lemma, but the genetic basis for this diagnostic character is unknown. Wide variations in awn length traits at the top and middle spikes were found in the Ae. tauschii core collection, and the awn length at the middle spike was significantly smaller in the eastward-dispersed sublineage than in those in other sublineages. To clarify loci controlling the awnless phenotype of var. anathera, we measured awn length of an intervariety F 2 mapping population, and found that the F 2 individuals could be divided into two groups mainly based on the awn length at the middle of spike, namely short and long awn groups, significantly fitting a 3:1 segregation ratio, which indicated that a single locus controls the awnless phenotype. The awnless locus, Anathera (Antr), was assigned to the distal region of the short arm of chromosome 5D. Quantitative trait locus analysis using the awn length data of each F 2 individual showed that only one major locus was at the same chromosomal position as Antr. These results suggest that a single dominant allele determines the awnless diagnostic character in the variety anathera. The Antr dominant allele is a novel gene inhibiting awn elongation in wheat and its relatives."

"29030762","abstracttext","Avenin-like storage proteins influence the rheological properties and processing quality in common wheat, and the discovery of new alleles will benefit wheat quality improvement. In this study, 13 avenin-like b alleles (TaALPb7D-A-M) were discovered in 108 Aegilops tauschii Coss. accessions. Ten alleles were reported for the first time, while the remaining three alleles were the same as alleles in other species. A total of 15 nucleotide changes were detected in the 13 alleles, resulting in only 11 amino acid changes because of synonymous mutations. Alleles TaALPb7D-E, TaALPb7D-G, and TaALPb7D-J encoded the same protein. These polymorphic sites existed in the N-terminus, Repetitive region (Left), Repetitive region (Right) and C-terminus domains, with no polymorphisms in the signal peptide sequence nor in those encoding the 18 conserved cysteine residues. Phylogenetic analysis divided the TaALPb7Ds into four clades. The Ae. tauschii alleles were distributed in all four clades, while the alleles derived from common wheat, TaALPb7D-G and TaALPb7D-C, belonged to clade III and IV, respectively. Alleles TaALPb7D-G and TaALPb7D-C were the most widely distributed, being present in nine and six countries, respectively. Iran and Turkey exhibited the highest genetic diversity with respect to TaALPb7D alleles, accessions from these countries carrying seven and six alleles, respectively, which implied that these countries were the centers of origin of the avenin-like b gene. The new alleles discovered and the phylogenetic analysis of avenin-like b genes will provide breeding materials and a theoretical basis for wheat quality improvement."

"29150697","abstracttext_key message","A novel TaGW2-A1 allele was identified from a stable, robust QTL region, which is pleiotropic for thousand grain weight, grain number per spike, and grain morphometric parameters in wheat. Thousand grain weight (TGW) and grain number per spike (GNS) are two crucial determinants of wheat spike yield, and genetic dissection of their relationships can help to fine-tune these two components and maximize grain yield. By evaluating 191 recombinant inbred lines in 11 field trials, we identified five genomic regions on chromosomes 1B, 3A, 3B, 5B, or 7A that solely influenced either TGW or GNS, and a further region on chromosome 6A that concurrently affected TGW and GNS. The QTL of interest on chromosome 6A, which was flanked by wsnp_BE490604A_Ta_2_1 and wsnp_RFL_Contig1340_448996 and designated as QTgw/Gns.cau-6A, was finely mapped to a genetic interval shorter than 0.538 cM using near isogenic lines (NILs). The elite NILs of QTgw/Gns.cau-6A increased TGW by 8.33%, but decreased GNS by 3.05% in six field trials. Grain Weight 2 (TaGW2-A1), a well-characterized gene that negatively regulates TGW and grain width in wheat, was located within the finely mapped interval of QTgw/Gns.cau-6A. A novel and rare TaGW2-A1 allele with a 114-bp deletion in the 5' flanking region was identified in the parent with higher TGW, and it reduced TaGW2-A1 promoter activity and expression. In conclusion, these results expand our knowledge of the genetic and molecular basis of TGW-GNS trade-offs in wheat. The QTLs and the novel TaGW2-A1 allele are likely useful for the development of cultivars with higher TGW and/or higher GNS."

A quantitative trait locus (QTL) for FHB resistance (FHB_SFI) located on the long arm of chromosome 2D in the spring wheat genotype Wuhan 1 is a resistance locus which has potential to improve the FHB resistance of bread wheat since it confers effective resistance to wheat breeding lines. Recently, differentially expressed genes (DEG) have been identified by comparing near isogenic lines (NIL) carrying the susceptible and resistant alleles for the 2DL QTL, using RNA-Seq. In the present study, we aimed to identify candidate genes located within the genetic interval for the 2DL QTL for FHB resistance, as assessed by single floret inoculation (FHB_SFI), and possibly contributing to it."

"31121904","abstracttext","Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the main growth-limiting factors for plants. However, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis can significantly promote P uptake. Generally, PHT1 transporters play key roles in plants' P uptake, and thus, PHT1 genes have been investigated in some plants, but the regulation and functions of these genes in wheat ( TaPHT1 ) during AM symbiosis have not been studied in depth. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of TaPHT1 genes was performed, including sequence, phylogeny, cis -elements, expression, subcellular localization and functions, to elucidate their roles in AM-associated phosphate transport and immunity. In total, 35 TaPHT1s were identified in the latest high-quality bread wheat genome, 34 of which were unevenly distributed on 13 chromosomes, and divided into five groups. Sequence analysis indicated that there are 11 types of motif architectures and five types of exon-intron structures in the TaPHT1 family. Duplication mode analysis indicated that the TaPHT1 family has expanded mainly through segmental and tandem duplication events, and that all duplicated gene pairs have been under purifying selection. Transcription analysis of the 35 TaPHT1s revealed that not only known the mycorrhizal-specific genes TaPht-myc , TaPT15-4B ( TaPT11 ) and TaPT19-4D ( TaPT10 ), but also four novel mycorrhizal-specific/inducible genes ( TaPT3-2D , TaPT11-4A , TaPT29-6A , and TaPT31-7A ) are highly up-regulated in AM wheat roots. Furthermore, the mycorrhizal-specific/inducible genes are significantly induced in wheat roots at different stages of infection by colonizing fungi. Transient Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated transformation expression in onion epidermal cells showed that TaPT29-6A is a membrane-localized protein. In contrast to other AM-specific/inducible PHT1 genes, TaPT29-6A is apparently required for the symbiotic and direct Pi pathway. TaPT29-6A -silenced lines exhibited reduced levels of AM fungal colonization and arbuscules, but increased susceptibility to biotrophic, hemi-biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. In conclusion, TaPT29-6A was not only essential for the AM symbiosis, but also played vital roles in immunity."
"32252420","articletitle","Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor Gene TaICK1 acts as a Potential Contributor to Wheat Male Sterility induced by a Chemical Hybridizing Agent."
"32252420","abstracttext","Heterosis has been widely accepted as an effective strategy to increase yields in plant breeding. Notably, the chemical hybridization agent SQ-1 induces male sterility in wheat, representing a critical potential tool in hybrid seed production. However, the mechanisms underlying the male sterility induced by SQ-1 still remain poorly understood. In this study, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor gene, TaICK1 , which encodes a 229 amino acid protein, was identified as a potential contributor to male sterility in common wheat. The expression of TaICK1 was upregulated during the development of anthers in Xinong1376 wheat treated with SQ-1. Meanwhile, the seed setting rate was found to be significantly decreased in TaICK1 transgenic rice. Furthermore, we identified two cyclin proteins, TaCYCD2;1 and TaCYCD6;1 , as interactors through yeast two-hybrid screening using TaICK1 as the bait, which were validated using bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Subcellular localization revealed that the proteins encoded by TaICK1 , TaCYCD2;1, and TaCYCD6;1 were localized in the cell nucleus. The expression levels of TaCYCD2;1 and TaCYCD6;1 were lower in Xinong1376 treated with SQ-1. A further analysis demonstrated that the expression levels of OsCYCD2;1 and OsCYCD6;1 were lower in transgenic TaICK1 rice lines as well. Taken together, these results suggest that the upregulation of TaICK1, induced by SQ-1, may subsequently suppress the expression of TaCYCD2;1 and TaCYCD6;1 in anthers, resulting in male sterility. This study provides new insights into the understanding of SQ-1-induced wheat male sterility, as well as the developmental mechanisms of anthers."

"32264833","abstracttext_background","Drought stress is one of the major factors limiting wheat production globally. Improving drought tolerance is important for agriculture sustainability. Although various morphological, physiological and biochemical responses associated with drought tolerance have been documented, the molecular mechanisms and regulatory genes that are needed to improve drought tolerance in crops require further investigation. We have used a novel 4-component version (for overexpression) and a 3-component version (for underexpression) of a barley stripe mosaic virus-based (BSMV) system for functional characterization of the C2H2-type zinc finger protein TaZFP1B in wheat. These expression systems avoid the need to produce transgenic plant lines and greatly speed up functional gene characterization."
"32264833","abstracttext_results","We show that overexpression of TaZFP1B stimulates plant growth and up-regulates different oxidative stress-responsive genes under well-watered conditions. Plants that overexpress TaZFP1B are more drought tolerant at critical periods of the plant's life cycle. Furthermore, RNA-Seq analysis revealed that plants overexpressing TaZFP1B reprogram their transcriptome, resulting in physiological and physical modifications that help wheat to grow and survive under drought stress. In contrast, plants transformed to underexpress TaZFP1B are significantly less tolerant to drought and growth is negatively affected."
"32264833","abstracttext_conclusions","This study clearly shows that the two versions of the BSMV system can be used for fast and efficient functional characterization of genes in crops. The extent of transcriptome reprogramming in plants that overexpress TaZFP1B indicates that the encoded transcription factor is a key regulator of drought tolerance in wheat."

"32291049","abstracttext","Plants have evolved complex mechanisms to mitigate osmotic and ionic stress caused by high salinity. The effect of exogenous spermine (Spm) and spermidine (Spd) on defence responses of wheat seedlings under NaCl stress was investigated by measuring antioxidant enzyme activities and the transcript expression of corresponding genes. Exogenous Spm and Spd decreased the level of malondialdehyde, increased chlorophyll and proline contents, and modulated PSII activity in wheat seedlings under salt stress. Spermidine alleviated negative effects on CO2 assimilation induced by salt stress in addition to significantly increasing the activity and content of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). It appears Spd conferred salinity tolerance in wheat seedlings by enhancing photosynthetic capacity through regulation of gene expression and the activity of key CO2 assimilation enzymes. Exogenous Spm regulated activities of different antioxidant enzymes (catalase, glutathione reductase, dehydroascorbate reductase, ascorbate peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase) and efficiently modulate their transcription levels in wheat seedlings under salt stress. It is likely that Spm plays a key role in alleviating oxidative damage of salt stress by adjusting antioxidant enzyme activities in plants. In addition, exogenous Spd increased transcript level of spermine synthase under salt stress. Salinity stress also caused an increase in transcript levels of diamine oxidase (DAO) and polyamine oxidase (PAO). Exogenous Spd application resulted in a marked increase in free Spd and Spm contents under saline conditions. These results show that exogenous Spd and Spm effectively upregulated transcriptional levels of antioxidant enzyme genes and improved the defence response of plants under salt stress."

"32293995","abstracttext","Stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) is one of the most destructive fungal diseases of wheat worldwide. The expanding Yr26 -virulent Pst race (V26) group overcomes almost all currently deployed resistance genes in China and has continued to accumulate new virulence. Investigating the genetic architecture of stripe rust resistance in common wheat is an important basis for a successful utilization of resistance in breeding programs. A panel of 410 exotic wheat germplasms was used for characterizing new stripe rust resistance loci. This panel was genotyped using high-density wheat 660K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, and phenotypic evaluation of seedlings for stripe rust resistance was performed using multiple Pst races. Thirty-five loci conferring resistance were identified through genome-wide association mapping, and explained phenotypic variances ranged from 53 to 75%. Of these, 14 were colocated in the proximity of the known loci, including cataloged Yr genes Yr9 , Yr10 , Yr26 , Yr33 , Yr47 , Yr56 , Yr57 , Yr64 , Yr67 , Yr72 , and Yr81 and three temporarily designated as YrCen , YrNP63 , and YrRC detected in our quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping studies. Seven of them ( Yr9 , Yr10 , Yr24/26 , Yr81 , YrCEN , YrNP63 , and YrRC ) were confirmed by molecular detection or genetic analysis. New loci that were identified to be different from reported Yr genes need further confirmation. Nine QTL with significantly large phenotypic effect on resistance to all tested races were considered as major loci for effective resistance. The identified loci enrich our stripe rust resistance gene pool, and the linked SNPs should be useful for marker-assisted selection in breeding programs."

"32563461","abstracttext","Various nutrients (Mg, Zn, Fe, Mn, Si, etc.) can supress cadmium (Cd) uptake and alleviate Cd toxicity, but the mechanisms are not the same. In this study, the molecular mechanism governing the effects of boron (B) on uptake of Cd in hydroponically grown wheat was characterized. As compared to control (0 μM Cd), B concentration per plant decreased by 22% and 29% under 5 μM Cd and 50 μM Cd treatment respectively. In addition, B application decreased Cd concentration and accumulation in whole wheat. Correlation analysis of different elements show that there was a highly negative correlation between concentrations of B and Cd (r = -0.854 with significant correlation) in wheat. Additionally, 16,543 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (7666 up- and 8877 down-regulated) were detected between 0 and 5 μM Cd treatments in wheat roots by transcriptome sequencing. Gene ontology functional category and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathway analyses indicated that the DEGs were involved in biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. Five highly homologous genes to Cd transporters were identified; these genes were involved in metal ion binding, transmembrane ion transport, and protein transport. According to the qRT-PCR results, expression of all these genes was down-regulated in the 462 μM of B treatment compared with the 46.2 μM of B treatment regardless of the Cd treatments (0.5 or 5 μM Cd). These results suggest that B is an inhibitor of Cd uptake, and the down-regulation of five highly homologous genes could be associated with decreased uptake of Cd after B application."

(Bd) has previously been developed as a pathosystem model for the wheat root rot pathogen Rhizoctonia solani Kühn anastomosis group 8 (AG8). Here we explore variation in resistance to R. solani AG8 in Bd, to determine whether genomic tools could be used to find Bd genes involved in the grass defence response, with the aim of using this information for the improvement of Rhizoctonia root rot resistance in wheat. We looked for variation in resistance to R. solani AG8 in a diverse Bd natural accession collection and in Bd T-DNA insertion lines selected based on putative mechanisms reported for tagged genes. All lines were susceptible to the pathogen. Repeatable and significant variation in resistance was measured in both groups, with greater variation in resistance found across the natural accessions than in the T-DNA lines. The widest and most repeatable variation in resistance was between lines Koz-3 and BdTR 13a. The ratio of R. solani AG8-inoculated to uninoculated root length for line Koz-3 was 33% greater than the same ratio for line BdTR 13a. The increased resistance of Koz-3 was associated with nodal root initiation in response to the pathogen. A negative correlation between seedling vigour and resistance was observed, but found not to be the sole source of variation in resistance to R. solani AG8. The only T-DNA line with significantly greater resistance to R. solani AG8 than the reference line had an insertion in a putative galactosyltransferase gene; however, this result needs further confirmation. Genetic resistance to Rhizoctonia root rot is not available in wheat cultivars and only a few instances of quantitative resistance to the pathogen have been described within close relatives of wheat. Brachypodium distachyon offers potential for further investigation to find genes associated with quantitative resistance and mechanisms of tolerance to R. solani AG8."

"30070970","abstracttext","Stripe rust is a major disease constraint of wheat production worldwide. Resistance to stripe rust was analyzed using 131 F 6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between synthetic derived wheat line Soru#1 and wheat cultivar Naxos. The phenotype was evaluated in Mexico and Norway at both seedling and adult plant stages. Linkage groups were constructed based on 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), sequence-tagged site, and simple sequence repeat markers. Two major resistance loci conferred by Soru#1 were detected and located on chromosomes 1BL and 4DS. The 1BL quantitative trait loci explained 15.8 to 40.2 and 51.1% of the phenotypic variation at adult plant and seedling stages, respectively. This locus was identified as Yr24/Yr26 based on the flanking markers and infection types. Locus 4DS was flanked by molecular markers D_GB5Y7FA02JMPQ0_238 and BS00108770_51. It explained 8.4 to 27.8 and 5.5% of stripe rust variation at the adult plant and seedling stages, respectively. The 4DS locus may correspond to known resistance gene Yr28 based on the resistance source. All RILs that combine Yr24/Yr26 and Yr28 showed significantly reduced stripe rust severity in all four environments compared with the lines with only one of the genes. SNP marker BS00108770_51 was converted into a breeder-friendly kompetitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction marker that will be useful to accelerate Yr28 deployment in wheat breeding programs."

"30734452","abstracttext","High temperature induces several proteins in plants that enhance tolerance to high temperature shock. The fate of proteins synthesised in microbial cells or secreted into culture media by interacting microbes has not been fully elucidated. The present investigation aimed to characterise plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat genotypes (differing in tolerance to high temperature stress) and evaluate their performance as bioinoculant for use in wheat. Four bacterial strains, viz. Pseudomonas brassicacearum, Bacillus thuringiensis, Bacillus cereus strain W6 and Bacillus subtilis, were isolated from the rhizosphere of heat-stressed and unstressed wheat genotypes. The wheat genotypes were exposed to high temperature stress at 45 °C for 10 days (3 h daily) at pre-anthesis phase. Isolates were identified on the basis of morphology and biochemical characteristics, 16S rRNA gene sequencing and whole cell protein profiles. Results were further complemented by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) with fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) and SDS PAGE of 80% ammonium sulphate precipitates of the cell-free supernatants. Isolates were positive for catalase, oxidases and antimicrobial activity. P. brassicacearum from the rhizosphere of the heat-tolerant genotype was more efficient in phosphate solubilisation, bacteriocin production, antifungal and antibacterial activity against Helminthosporium sativum, Fusarium moniliforme and Klebsiella pneumonia, respectively. The inoculated seedlings had significantly higher root and shoot fresh weight, enhanced activity of antioxidant enzymes, proline and protein content. Total profiling of the culture with SDS-PAGE indicated expression of new protein bands in 95 kDa in P. brassicacearum. Temperature-induced changes in PGPR isolates are similar to those in the host plant. P. brassicacearum may be a good candidate for use in biofertiliser production for plants exposed to high temperature stress."

"30764099","abstracttext","The Fusarium graminearum species complex (Fg complex) that consists of at least 11 phylogenetically distinct species contains important Fusarium head blight (FHB) pathogens of wheat and barley worldwide. We obtained members of the Fg complex by sampling from a 500-m 2 experimental wheat field in Kumamoto Prefecture, Japan in two consecutive years and assessed them for species identity and trichothecene chemotype. Haplotype diversity was estimated by using 11 variable numbers of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers. In addition to these two samples (group 03W in 2003 and group 04W in 2004), pathogen populations from seed that was harvested in Fukuoka Prefecture and planted in the experimental field in 2002 (group 02WSC) and pathogen populations from seed that was harvested in Nagasaki Prefecture and planted in 2003 (group 03WSC) were analyzed for this study. Forty-six isolates were collected in each group. Most isolates from wheat heads were classified as F. asiaticum; only four isolates were classified as F. graminearum sensu stricto (s. str.). Out of a total of 183 Fg complex strains, 80 isolates (44%) were of the NIV type, while 103 isolates (56%), including all four F. graminearum s. str. isolates, were of the 3ADON type. No 15ADON type isolate was detected in this study. Trichothecene chemotype compositions of 03W and 04W were nearly identical. High gene diversity of F. asiaticum was observed in all groups. Based on the observed low level of fixation index (F ST ) and high level of effective number of migrants (Nm), distinctive population subdivision of F. asiaticum was not inferred among the four groups. These results suggest that FHB in the experimental wheat field in both 2003 and 2004 was caused by a genetically similar population, which prevails in Kumamoto, Fukuoka, and Nagasaki prefectures."

"32340279","abstracttext","Black point is a fungal disease of wheat, mainly associated with mycotoxigenic Alternaria species. Affected wheat kernels are characterized by dark brown discolouration of the embryo region and reduction of grain quality. Potential risk is the possible accumulation of Alternaria mycotoxins, alternariol (AOH), alternariol-monomethyl ether (AME), tenuazonic acid (TA), and altenuene (ALT), provided by haemato-toxic, genotoxic, and mutagenic activities. One hundred and twenty durum wheat samples belonging to 30 different genotypes grown in Bologna and Modena areas, in Italy, showing black point symptoms, were analyzed for Alternaria species and their mycotoxin contamination. Alternariol was selected as an indicator of the capability of the Alternaria species to produce mycotoxin in vivo in field conditions. The data showed that Alternaria species occurred in 118 out of 120 wheat kernels samples, with the incidence of infected kernels ranging between 1% and 26%. Moreover, AOH was detected by using a HPLC with a diode array detector (LC-DAD) in 98 out of 120 samples with values ranging between 24 and 262 µg Kg -1 . Ninety-two Alternaria representative strains, previously identified morphologically, were identified at species/section level using gene sequencing, and therefore were analyzed for their mycotoxin profiles. Eighty-four strains, phylogenetically grouped in the Alternaria section, produced AOH, AME, and TA with values up to 8064, 14,341, and 3683 µg g -1 , respectively, analyzed by using a LC-DAD.

"30669499","abstracttext","Cereal cyst nematodes (CCNs) are among the most important nematode pests that limit production of small grain cereals like wheat and barley. These nematodes alone are estimated to reduce production of crops by 10% globally. This necessitates a huge enhancement of nematode resistance in cereal crops against CCNs. Nematode resistance in wheat and barley in combination with higher grain yields has been a preferential research area for cereal nematologists. This usually involved the targeted genetic exploitations through natural means of classical selection breeding of resistant genotypes and finding quantitative trait luci (QTLs) associated with resistance genes. These improvements were based on available genetic diversity among the crop plants. Recently, genome-wide association studies have widely been exploited to associate nematode resistance or susceptibility with particular regions of the genome. Use of biotechnological tools through the application of various transgenic strategies for enhancement of nematode resistance in various crop plants including wheat and barley had also been an important area of research. These modern approaches primarily include the use of gene silencing, exploitation of nematode effector genes, proteinase inhibitors, chemodisruptive peptides and a combination of one or more of these approaches. Furthermore, the perspective genome editing technologies including CRISPR-Cas9 could also be helpful for improving CCN resistance in wheat and barley. The information provided in this review will be helpful to enhance resistance against CCNs and will attract the attention of the scientific community towards this neglected area."

"30283469","abstracttext","Wheat breeding nowadays must address producers and consumers' desire. According to the last FAO report, a dramatic decrease in wheat production is expected in the next decades mainly due to the upcoming climate change. The identification of the processes which are triggered by heat stress and how thermotolerance develops in wheat is an active research topic. Genomic approach may help wheat breeding since it allows direct study on the genotype and relationship with the phenotype. Here the isolation and characterization of four members of the chloroplast-localized small heat shock proteins (sHSP) encoded by the Hsp26 gene family is reported. Furthermore, two high throughput TILLING (Targeting Induced Local Lesions In Genomes) approaches in vivo and in silico were used for the identification of new alleles within this family. Small heat shock proteins are known to prevent the irreversible aggregation of misfolded proteins and contribute to the acquisition of thermotolerance. Chloroplast-localized sHSPs protect the photosynthetic machinery during episodes of high temperature stress. The modulation of the newly discovered genes within the sHsp26 family has been analyzed in vivo and by the ExpVIP platform widening the abiotic stress analysis; and their involvement in the heat stress response has been demonstrated. In addition, in this study a total of 50 TILLING mutant lines have been identified. A set of KASP (Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR) markers was also developed to follow the specific mutations in the ongoing backcrosses, applicable to high throughput genotyping approaches and usable in marker assisted selection breeding programs."

In total, 97 isolates were recovered from stripe rust samples collected in Ethiopia in 2013 and 2014. These isolates were tested on a set of 18 Yr single-gene differentials for characterization of races and 7 supplementary differentials for additional information of virulence. Of 18 P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races identified, the 5 most predominant races were PSTv-105 (21.7%), PSTv-106 (17.5%), PSTv-107 (11.3%), PSTv-76 (10.3%), and PSTv-41 (6.2%). High frequencies (>40%) were detected for virulence to resistance genes Yr1, Yr2, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr17, Yr25, Yr27, Yr28, Yr31, Yr43, Yr44, YrExp2, and YrA. Low frequencies (<40%) were detected for virulence to Yr10, Yr24, Yr32, YrTr1, Hybrid 46, and Vilmorin 23. None of the isolates were virulent to Yr5, Yr15, YrSP, and YrTye. Among the six collection regions, Arsi Robe and Tiyo had the highest virulence diversities, followed by Bekoji, while Bale and Holeta had the lowest. Evaluation of 178 Ethiopian wheat cultivars and landraces with two of the Ethiopian races and three races from the United States indicated that the Ethiopian races were more virulent on the germplasm than the predominant races of the United States. Thirteen wheat cultivars or landraces that were resistant or moderately resistant to all five tested races should be useful for breeding wheat cultivars with resistance to stripe rust in both countries."

"31803533","abstracttext_background","Plant cell metabolism inevitably forms reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage cells or lead to their death. The antioxidant system (AOS) evolved to eliminate a high concentration of ROS. For plants, this system consists of the seven classes of antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant compounds. Each enzymatic class contains a various number of genes which may vary from species to species. In such a multi-copy genetic system, the integration of evolutionary characteristics and expression data makes it possible to effectively predict promising breeding targets for the design of highly-yielding cultivars. In the plant cells, ROS production can increase as a result of abiotic stresses. Accordingly, AOS responds to stress by altering the expression of the genes of its components. Expression profiles of AOS enzymes, including their changes under stress, remains incomplete. A comprehensive study of the system behavior in response to stress for different species gives the key to identify the general mechanisms of AOS regulation. In this article, we studied stress-induced changes in the expression of AOS genes in photosynthetic tissues for rice and bread wheat."

Landraces collected from different climate zones can be an invaluable resource for such adaptive alleles."
"31805861","abstracttext_results","GWAS was performed using a collection of 298 Iranian bread wheat varieties and landraces to explore the genetic basis of agronomic traits during 2016-2018 cropping seasons under normal (well-watered) and stressed (rain-fed) conditions. A high-quality genotyping by sequencing (GBS) dataset was obtained using either all original single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP, 10938 SNPs) or with additional imputation (46,862 SNPs) based on W7984 reference genome. The results confirm that the B genome carries the highest number of significant marker pairs in both varieties (49,880, 27.37%) and landraces (55,086, 28.99%). The strongest linkage disequilibrium (LD) between pairs of markers was observed on chromosome 2D (0.296). LD decay was lower in the D genome, compared to the A and B genomes.

Genome-wide gene expression reprogramming was observed in wheat roots subjected to Fe starvation, with a total of 5854 genes differentially expressed. Homoeologue and subgenome-specific analysis unveiled the induction-biased contribution from the A and B genomes. In general, the predominance of genes coding for nicotianamine synthase, yellow stripe-like transporters, metal transporters, ABC transporters, and zinc-induced facilitator-like protein was noted. Expression of genes related to the Strategy II mode of Fe uptake was also predominant. Our transcriptomic data were in agreement with the GC-MS analysis that showed the enhanced accumulation of various metabolites such as fumarate, malonate, succinate, and xylofuranose, which could be contributing to Fe mobilization. Interestingly, Fe starvation leads to a significant temporal increase of glutathione S-transferase at both the transcriptional level and enzymatic activity level, which indicates the involvement of glutathione in response to Fe stress in wheat roots. Taken together, our result provides new insight into the wheat response to Fe starvation at the molecular level and lays the foundation to design new strategies for the improvement of Fe nutrition in crops."

"31709381","abstracttext","In order to clarify the transcriptional regulatory network and physiological mechanisms governing leaf senescence response to drought stress in wheat, experiments were performed using two wheat varieties with contrasting drought tolerance: Fu287 (F287, a drought-sensitive genotype) and Shannong20 (SN20, a drought-resistant genotype). The latter has higher SPAD values, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), zeatin (Z), zeatin riboside (ZR), and gibberellin (GA 3 ) content as well as higher expression levels of Cu/Zn-SOD , Mn-SOD , Fe-SOD , POD , CAT , and APX under various water deficit conditions. Conjoint analysis of physiological and biochemical indicators and transcriptome data by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) in the present study provides a useful genomic and molecular resource for studying drought adaptation in wheat. The flag leaf senescence process was changed by altering the concentration of phytohormones. SA, JA, abscisic acid (ABA), Z, ZR, and GA 3 coordinate with each other to control leaf senescence and plant adaptation under drought stress. Further, the leaf senescence process was divided into two phases: the persistence phase and the rapid loss phase. Shorter Chl total (duration of the flag leaf being photosynthetically active), shorter Chl per (persistence phase), reduced M (inflection point cumulative temperature when senescence rate is the maximum), decreased r max (the maximum senescence rate), larger r 0 (the initial senescence rate), and increased r aver (the average senescence rate) were slightly associated with low grain mass. We speculated that extending the period of the persistence phase by cultivation or chemical control measures could further increase the drought survivability and productivity of wheat."

"31921229","abstracttext","Basic leucine zipper (bZIP) membrane-bound transcription factors (MTFs) play important roles in regulating plant growth and development, abiotic stress responses, and disease resistance. Most bZIP MTFs are key components of signaling pathways in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress responses. In this study, a full-length cDNA sequence encoding bZIP MTF, designated TabZIP74 , was isolated from a cDNA library of wheat near-isogenic lines of Taichung29*6/ Yr10 inoculated with an incompatible race CYR32 of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ). Phylogenic analysis showed that TabZIP74 is highly homologous to ZmbZIP60 in maize and OsbZIP74 in rice. The mRNA of TabZIP74 was predicted to form a secondary structure with two kissing hairpin loops that could be spliced, causing an open reading frame shift immediately before the hydrophobic region to produce a new TabZIP74 protein without the transmembrane domain. Pst infection and the abiotic polyethylene glycol (PEG) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments lead to TabZIP74 mRNA splicing in wheat seedling leaves, while both spliced and unspliced forms in roots were detected. In the confocal microscopic examination, TabZIP74 is mobilized in the nucleus from the membrane of tobacco epidermal cells in response to wounding. Knocking down TabZIP74 with barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing (BSMV-VIGS) enhanced wheat seedling susceptibility to stripe rust and decreased drought tolerance and lateral roots of silenced plants. These findings demonstrate that TabZIP74 mRNA is induced to splice when stressed by biotic and abiotic factors, acts as a critically positive regulator for wheat stripe rust resistance and drought tolerance, and is necessary for lateral root development."

"31921233","abstracttext","Tan spot is a destructive foliar wheat disease worldwide and caused by the ascomycete fungus Pyrenophora tritici-repentis ( Ptr ); it has become more frequent in Tunisia over the last decade. In this study, the virulence of 73 single-spore isolates, collected from durum and bread wheat fields during 2017-2018 growing season, was evaluated on four differential wheat genotypes. This was followed by polymerase chain reaction tests with specific primers for the effector genes ToxA , ToxB , and toxb ( ToxB -homolog). Sequence analysis to validate the identity of the amplified genes was followed, and ToxA amplicons from a subset of 22 isolates were analyzed to determine its haplotype identity. Ptr isolates from Tunisia were grouped in races 2, 4, 5, and 7, and 44% of the tested isolates did not fit under any known race, and were denoted here as atypical. These atypical isolates induced the same symptoms as race 7 isolates, extensive necrosis, and chlorosis on susceptible genotypes, but lacked the ToxA gene. ToxA is the only identified necrosis-inducing effector in Ptr , and was amplified in 51% of tested isolates, and shared identical sequence to previously identified haplotype (H15). ToxB and its homolog toxb were present in 97% and 93% of tested isolates, respectively. Ptr in Tunisia lacked Ptr ToxC activity, and none of the tested isolates induced the specific symptoms of that effector. Race 7 and the atypical isolates dominated the Tunisian Ptr population, while races 2, 4, and 5 were found at low percentages. In conclusion, ToxB and its homolog were the most dominant genes in Ptr from Tunisia, and the majority of the isolates induced necrosis and chlorosis on Ptr ToxA and Ptr ToxB susceptible wheat genotypes. However, only about half of that necrosis can be attributed to ToxA presence, this result necessitates further research to investigate the prevalence of additional necrotic effector(s). Terminology: in this paper, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis abbreviated as Ptr , the effectors are referred to by Ptr ToxA, Ptr ToxB and Ptr ToxC, and the genes coding for them are written in italic as ToxA , ToxB , and ToxC , respectively."

"31336736","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), is one of the most devastating fungal diseases of wheat worldwide. It is essential to discover more sources of stripe rust resistance genes for wheat breeding programs. Specific locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) is a powerful tool for the construction of high-density genetic maps. In this study, a set of 200 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between wheat cultivars Chuanmai 42 (CH42) and Chuanmai 55 (CH55) was used to construct a high-density genetic map and to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for stripe rust resistance using SLAF-seq technology. A genetic map of 2828.51 cM, including 21 linkage groups, contained 6732 single nucleotide polymorphism markers (SNP). Resistance QTLs were identified on chromosomes 1B, 2A, and 7B; Qyr.saas-7B was derived from CH42, whereas Qyr.saas-1B and Qyr.saas-2A were from CH55. The physical location of Qyr.saas-1B , which explained 6.24-34.22% of the phenotypic variation, overlapped with the resistance gene Yr29 . Qyr.saas-7B accounted for up to 20.64% of the phenotypic variation. Qyr.saas-2A , a minor QTL, was found to be a likely new stripe rust resistance locus. A significant additive effect was observed when all three QTLs were combined. The combined resistance genes could be of value in breeding wheat for stripe rust resistance."

"31252573","abstracttext","Climate change is a major threat to most of the agricultural crops grown in tropical and sub-tropical areas globally. Drought stress is one of the consequences of climate change that has a negative impact on crop growth and yield. In the past, many simulation models were proposed to predict climate change and drought occurrences, and it is extremely important to improve essential crops to meet the challenges of drought stress which limits crop productivity and production. Wheat and barley are among the most common and widely used crops due to their economic and social values. Many parts of the world depend on these two crops for food and feed, and both crops are vulnerable to drought stress. Improving drought stress tolerance is a very challenging task for wheat and barley researchers and more research is needed to better understand this stress. The progress made in understanding drought tolerance is due to advances in three main research areas: physiology, breeding, and genetic research. The physiology research focused on the physiological and biochemical metabolic pathways that plants use when exposed to drought stress. New wheat and barley genotypes having a high degree of drought tolerance are produced through breeding by making crosses from promising drought-tolerant genotypes and selecting among their progeny. Also, identifying genes contributing to drought tolerance is very important. Previous studies showed that drought tolerance is a polygenic trait and genetic constitution will help to dissect the gene network(s) controlling drought tolerance. This review explores the recent advances in these three research areas to improve drought tolerance in wheat and barley."

"31141162","abstracttext_background","For over a century, genetic diversity of wheat worldwide was eroded by continual selection for high yields and industrial demands. Wheat landraces cultivated in Israel and Palestine demonstrate high genetic diversity and a potentially wide repertoire of adaptive alleles. While most Israeli-Palestinian wheat landraces were lost in the transition to 'Green Revolution' semi-dwarf varieties, some germplasm collections made at the beginning of the 20th century survived in gene banks and private collections worldwide. However, fragmentation and poor conservation place this unique genetic resource at a high risk of genetic erosion. Herein, we describe a long-term initiative to restore, conserve, and characterize a collection of Israeli and Palestinian wheat landraces (IPLR)."

"31613193","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina ) and stripe rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ) cause large production losses in many regions of the world. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust in a recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross between wheat cultivars SW 8588 and Thatcher. The population and parents were genotyped with the Wheat 55K SNP Array and SSR markers and phenotyped for leaf rust severity at Zhoukou in Henan Province and Baoding in Hebei Province. Stripe rust responses were also evaluated at Chengdu in Sichuan Province, and at Baoding. Seven and six QTL were detected for resistance to leaf rust and stripe rust, respectively. Four QTL on chromosomes 1BL, 2AS, 5AL, and 7BL conferred resistance to both rusts. The QTL on 1BL and 2AS were identified as Lr46 / Yr29 and Lr37 / Yr17 , respectively. QLr.hebau-2DS from Thatcher, identified as Lr22b that was previously thought to be ineffective in China, contributed a large effect for leaf rust resistance. QLr . hebau-5AL / QYr.hebau-5AL , QLr.hebau-3BL , QLr.hebau-6DS , QYr.hebau-4BS , and QYr.hebau-6DS are likely to be new QTL, but require further validation. Kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers for QLr.hebau-2DS and QLr.hebau-5AL / QYr.hebau-5AL were successfully developed and validated in a diverse wheat panel from Sichuan Province, indicating their usefulness under different genetic backgrounds. These QTL and their closely linked SNP and SSR markers will be useful for fine mapping, candidate gene discovery, and marker-assisted selection in breeding for durable resistance to both leaf and stripe rusts."

"31628754","abstracttext","Celiac disease (CeD) is driven by CD4 +  T-cell responses to dietary gluten proteins of wheat, barley, and rye when deamidated gluten epitopes are presented by certain disease-associated HLA-DQ allotypes. About 90% of the CeD patients express HLA-DQ2.5. In such patients, five gluten epitopes dominate the anti-gluten T-cell response; two epitopes unique to wheat, two epitopes present in wheat, barley, and rye and one epitope unique to barley. Despite presence of barley in commonly consumed food and beverages and hence being a prominent source of gluten, knowledge about T-cell responses elicited by barley in CeD is scarce. Therefore, in this study, we explored T-cell response toward the barley unique epitope DQ2.5-hor-3 (PIPEQPQPY) by undertaking HLA-DQ:gluten peptide tetramer staining, single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) αβ sequencing, T-cell cloning, and T-cell proliferation studies. We demonstrate that majority of the CeD patients generate T-cell response to DQ2.5-hor-3, and this response is characterized by clonal expansion, preferential TCR V-gene usage and public TCR features thus echoing findings previously made for wheat gluten epitopes. The knowledge that biased and public TCRs underpin the T-cell response to all the immunodominant gluten epitopes in CeD suggests that such T cells are promising diagnostic and therapeutic targets."

"31628879","abstracttext","Wheat awn plays a vital role in photosynthesis, grain production, and drought tolerance. However, the systematic identification or cloning of genes controlling wheat awn development is seldom reported. Here, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) with 364 wheat accessions and identified 26 loci involved in awn length development, including previously characterized B1, B2, Hd, and several rice homologs. The dominant awn suppressor B1 was fine mapped to a 125-kb physical interval, and a C 2 H 2 zinc finger protein Awn Length Inhibitor 1 (ALI-1) was confirmed to be the underlying gene of the B1 locus through the functional complimentary test with native awnless allele. ALI-1 expresses predominantly in the developing spike of awnless individuals, transcriptionally suppressing downstream genes. ALI-1 reduces cytokinin content and simultaneously restrains cytokinin signal transduction, leading to a stagnation of cell proliferation and reduction of cell numbers during awn development. Polymorphisms of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in ALI-1 promoter region are diagnostic for the B1/b1 genotypes, and these SNPs are associated with awn length (AL), grain length (GL) and thousand-grain weight (TGW). More importantly, ali-1 was observed to increase grain length in wheat, which is a valuable attribute of awn on grain weight, aside from photosynthesis. Therefore, ALI-1 pleiotropically regulates awn and grain development, providing an alternative for grain yield improvement and addressing future climate changes."

"31523509","abstracttext","Arthropods often have obligate relationships with symbiotic microbes, and recent investigations have demonstrated that such host-microbe relationships could be exploited to suppress natural populations of vector carrying mosquitos. Strategies that target the interplay between agricultural pests and their symbionts could decrease the burden caused by agricultural pests; however, the lack of comprehensive genomic insights into naturally occurring microbial symbionts presents a significant bottleneck. Here we employed amplicon surveys, genome-resolved metagenomics, and scanning electron microscopy to investigate symbionts of the wheat stem sawfly ( Cephus cinctus ), a major pest that causes an estimated $350 million dollars or more in wheat yield losses in the northwestern United States annually. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing of two major haplotypes and life stages of wheat stem sawfly, we show a novel Spiroplasma species is ever-present and predominant, with phylogenomic analyses placing it as a member of the ixodetis clade of mollicutes. Using state-of-the-art metagenomic assembly and binning strategies we were able to reconstruct a 714 Kb, 72.7%-complete Spiroplasma genome, which represents just the second draft genome from the ixodetis clade of mollicutes. Functional annotation of the Spiroplasma genome indicated carbohydrate-metabolism involved PTS-mediated import of glucose and fructose followed by glycolysis to lactate, acetate, and propionoate. The bacterium also encoded biosynthetic pathways for essential vitamins B2, B3, and B9. We identified putative Spiroplasma virulence genes: cardiolipin and chitinase. These results identify a previously undescribed symbiosis between wheat stem sawfly and a novel Spiroplasma sp., availing insight into their molecular relationship, and may yield new opportunities for microbially-mediated pest control strategies."
"31332594","articletitle","Probing early wheat grain development via transcriptomic and proteomic approaches."
"31332594","abstracttext","To understand the molecular changes taking place during the early grain development in common wheat, we profiled transcriptome and proteome of two cultivars, ""P271"" and ""Chinese Spring"" (CS) with large and small grains, respectively. More than 85,000 genes and 7500 proteins were identified to express during early grain development in two wheat cultivars. We observed enrichment in the number of genes falling in the functional categories-carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, and cofactor as well as vitamin metabolism with progression in grain development, which indicates towards the importance of these metabolic pathways during grain maturation. Many genes showed inconsistency between transcription and translation, which suggested a role of post-transcriptional events that determine the fate of nascent transcript/protein, in the early grain development. In silico localization of differentially expressed genes/proteins between CS and P271 to wheat chromosomes, exhibited a biased genomic distribution with chromosomes 1A, 4B, and 5B contributing primarily to it. These results corroborated the earlier findings, where chromosomes 1A, 4B, and 5B were reported to harbor genes/QTLs for yield contributing traits such as grain length and thickness. Collectively, this study reveals the molecular changes taking place during early grain development, through light on the regulation of these processes, and allows identification of the gene candidates contributing to the contrasting grain characteristics of CS and P721. This information has implications in the future wheat breeding for the enhanced grain yield."

"31352407","abstracttext","Roots are the main channel for water and nutrient uptake in plants. Optimization of root architecture provides a viable strategy to improve nutrient and water uptake efficiency and maintain crop productivity under water-limiting and nutrient-poor conditions. We know little, however, about the genetic control of root development in wheat, a crop supplying 20% of global calorie and protein intake. To improve our understanding of the genetic control of seminal root development in wheat, we conducted a high-throughput screen for variation in seminal root number using an exome-sequenced mutant population derived from the hexaploid wheat cultivar Cadenza. The screen identified seven independent mutants with homozygous and stably altered seminal root number phenotypes. One mutant, Cadenza0900, displays a recessive extra seminal root number phenotype, while six mutants (Cadenza0062, Cadenza0369, Cadenza0393, Cadenza0465, Cadenza0818 and Cadenza1273) show lower seminal root number phenotypes most likely originating from defects in the formation and activation of seminal root primordia. Segregation analysis in F 2 populations suggest that the phenotype of Cadenza0900 is controlled by multiple loci whereas the Cadenza0062 phenotype fits a 3:1 mutant:wild-type segregation ratio characteristic of dominant single gene action. This work highlights the potential to use the sequenced wheat mutant population as a forward genetic resource to uncover novel variation in agronomic traits, such as seminal root architecture."

Thousands of new genic regions and cis-regulatory elements are identified based on the combinatorial pattern of chromatin features. Roughly 1.5% of the genome encodes a subset of active regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancer-like elements, which are characterized by a high degree of chromatin openness and histone acetylation, an abundance of CpG islands, and low DNA methylation levels. A comparison across sub-genomes reveals that evolutionary selection on gene regulation is targeted at the sequence and chromatin feature levels.

"31294680","abstracttext","The induction of plant defense mechanisms by resistance inducers is an attractive and innovative alternative to reduce the use of fungicides on wheat against Zymoseptoria tritici , the responsible agent of Septoria tritici blotch (STB). Under controlled conditions, we investigated the resistance induction in three wheat cultivars with different susceptible levels to STB as a response to a treatment with a sulfur, manganese sulfate, and protein-based resistance inducer (NECTAR Céréales). While no direct antigermination effect of the product was observed in planta, more than 50% reduction of both symptoms and sporulation were recorded on the three tested cultivars. However, an impact of the wheat genotype on resistance induction was highlighted, which affects host penetration, cell colonization, and the production of cell-wall degrading enzymes by the fungus. Moreover, in the most susceptible cultivar Alixan, the product upregulated POX2 , PAL , PR1 , and GLUC gene expression in both noninoculated and inoculated plants and CHIT2 in noninoculated plants only. In contrast, defense responses induced in Altigo, the most resistant cultivar, seem to be more specifically mediated by the phenylpropanoid pathway in noninoculated as well as inoculated plants, since PAL and CHS were most specifically upregulated in this cultivar. In Premio, the moderate resistant cultivar, NECTAR Céréales elicits mainly the octadecanoid pathway, via LOX and AOS induction in noninoculated plants. We concluded that this complex resistance-inducing product protects wheat against Z. tritici by stimulating the cultivar-dependent plant defense mechanisms."

"31649708","abstracttext","Genetic resistance in the host plant is the most economical and environmentally friendly strategy for controlling wheat leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. The durum wheat lines Gaza (Middle East), Arnacoris (France) and Saragolla (Italy) express high levels of resistance to the Mexican races of P. triticina . Three recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations, derived from crosses of each of these resistance sources to the susceptible line ATRED #2, were evaluated for leaf rust reactions at CIMMYT's leaf rust nurseries in Mexico. Genetic analyses of host reactions suggested oligogenic control of resistance in all populations. The F 8 RILs from each cross were genotyped using the Illumina iSelect 90K array, and high-density genetic maps were constructed for each population. Using composite interval mapping, a total of seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) that provide resistance to leaf rust were identified. Two QTL designated as QLr.usw-6BS and QLr.usw-6BL were identified on chromosome 6B in Gaza, which explained up to 78.5% and 21.3% of the observed leaf rust severity variance, respectively. A major QTL designated as QLr.usw-7BL was detected on the long arm of chromosome 7B in Arnacoris, which accounted for up to 65.9% of the disease severity variance. Arnacoris also carried a minor QTL on chromosome 1BL, designated as QLr.usw-1BL.1 that explained up to 17.7% of the phenotypic variance. Three QTL conferred leaf rust resistance in Saragolla, namely QLr.usw-2BS , QLr.usw-3B , and QLr.usw-1BL.2 , which accounted for up to 42.3, 9.4, and 7.1% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Markers flanking each QTL were physically mapped against the durum wheat reference sequence and candidate genes involved in disease resistance were identified within the QTL intervals. The QTL identified in this study and their closely linked markers are useful resources for gene pyramiding and breeding for durable leaf rust resistance in durum wheat."
"33155760","articletitle","New insights into homoeologous copy number variations in the hexaploid wheat genome."
"33155760","abstracttext","Bread wheat is an allohexaploid species originating from two successive and recent rounds of hybridization between three diploid species that were very similar in terms of chromosome number, genome size, TE content, gene content and synteny. As a result, it has long been considered that most of the genes were in three pairs of homoeologous copies. However, these so-called triads represent only one half of wheat genes, while the remaining half belong to homoeologous groups with various number of copies across subgenomes. In this study, we examined and compared the distribution, conservation, function, expression and epigenetic profiles of triads with homoeologous groups having undergone a deletion (dyads) or a duplication (tetrads) in one subgenome. We show that dyads and tetrads are mostly located in distal regions and have lower expression level and breadth than triads. Moreover, they are enriched in functions related to adaptation and more associated with the repressive H3K27me3 modification. Altogether, these results suggest that triads mainly correspond to housekeeping genes and are part of the core genome, while dyads and tetrads belong to the Triticeae dispensable genome. In addition, by comparing the different categories of dyads and tetrads, we hypothesize that, unlike most of the allopolyploid species, subgenome dominance and biased fractionation are absent in hexaploid wheat. Differences observed between the three subgenomes are more likely related to two successive and ongoing waves of post-polyploid diploidization, that had impacted A and B more significantly than D, as a result of the evolutionary history of hexaploid wheat."
"33072007","articletitle","Predicating the Effector Proteins Secreted by Puccinia triticina Through Transcriptomic Analysis and Multiple Prediction Approaches."
"33072007","abstracttext","Wheat leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is one of the most common and serious diseases in wheat production. The constantly changing pathogens overcome the plant resistance to P. triticina . Plant pathogens secrete effector proteins that alter the structure of the host cell, interfere plant defenses, or modify the physiology of plant cells. Therefore, the identification of effector proteins is critical to reveal the pathogenic mechanism. We used SignalP v4.1, TargetP v1.1, TMHMM v2.0, and EffectorP v2.0 to screen the candidate effector proteins in P. triticina isolates - KHTT, JHKT, and THSN. As a result, a total of 635 candidate effector proteins were obtained. Structural analysis showed that effector proteins were small in size (50AA to 422AA) and of diverse sequences, and the conserved sequential elements or clear common elements were not involved, regardless of their secretion from the pathogen to the host. There were 427 candidate effector proteins that contain more than or equal to 4 cysteine residues, and 339 candidate effector proteins contained the known motifs. Sixteen families, 9 domains, and 53 other known functional types were found in 186 candidate effector proteins using the Pfam search. Three novel motifs were found by MEME. Heterogeneous expression system was performed to verify the functions of 30 candidate effectors by inhibiting the programmed cell death (PCD) induced by BAX (the mouse-apoptotic gene elicitor) on Nicotiana benthamiana . Hypersensitive response (HR) can be induced by the six effectors in the wheat leaf rust resistance near isogenic lines, and this would be shown by the method of transient expression through Agrobacterium tumefaciens infiltration. The quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of 14 candidate effector proteins secreted after P. triticina inoculation showed that the tested effectors displayed different expression patterns in different stages, suggesting that they may be involved in the wheat- P. triticina interaction. The results showed that the prediction of P. triticina effector proteins based on transcriptomic analysis and multiple bioinformatics software is effective and more accurate, laying the foundation of revealing the pathogenic mechanism of Pt and controlling disease."

"33268929","abstracttext","In wheat, 25 Rht genes for dwarfness are known, which include both, GA-insensitive and GA-responsive genes. The GA-insensitive Rht genes have been widely used, although, their suitability under abiotic stress conditions has been questioned. This necessitated a search for alternative GA-responsive, spontaneous and induced dwarfing genes. We earlier reported an induced dwarf mutant ('dwarf mutant-3'; 44 cm), and the mutant allele was named Rht4c allele (2BL). This dwarf mutant was not suitable for cultivation due to its extra dwarf nature. Therefore, we searched for naturally occurring QTLs, which would modify the phenotype of 'dwarf-mutant-3' using 'mutant-assisted gene identification and characterization' (MAGIC) approach. For this purpose, the 'dwarf mutant-3' was crossed with a tall wheat cv. NP114 and homozygous mutant F 2 plants (~ 25% of the progeny) were selected, which were phenotyped for plant height and genotyped using SSR markers. The data were utilized for QTL analysis and plant height. Six modifier QTLs were identified on chromosomes 2A, 2B and 4A. Two QTLs each on 2A and 2B were responsible for increase in plant height (described as 'enhancer modifiers'), whereas the remaining two QTLs located on 4A were responsible for reducing the plant height (described as 'suppressor modifiers'). It was hypothesized that the enhancer QTLs could be exploited for the development of semi-dwarf high yielding genotypes containing Rht4c allele. This is the first study of its kind in wheat demontsrating that the MAGIC approach could be used for identification of modifiers of the mutant phenotypes of other traits for wheat improvement."
"2017357","articletitle","Plant nonsense suppressor tRNA(Tyr) genes are expressed at very low levels in vitro due to inefficient splicing of the intron-containing pre-tRNAs."
"2017357","abstracttext","Oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis was used to generate amber, ochre and opal suppressors from cloned Arabidopsis and Nicotiana tRNA(Tyr) genes. The nonsense suppressor tRNA(Tyr) genes were efficiently transcribed in HeLa and yeast nuclear extracts, however, intron excision from all mutant pre-tRNAs(Tyr) was severely impaired in the homologous wheat germ extract as well as in the yeast in vitro splicing system. The change of one nucleotide in the anticodon of suppressor pre-tRNAs leads to a distortion of the potential intron-anticodon interaction. In order to demonstrate that this caused the reduced splicing efficiency, we created a point mutation in the intron of Arabidopsis tRNA(Tyr) which affected the interaction with the wild-type anticodon. As expected, the resulting pre-tRNA was also inefficiently spliced. Another mutation in the intron, which restored the base-pairing between the amber anticodon and the intron of pre-tRNA(Tyr), resulted in an excellent substrate for wheat germ splicing endonuclease. This type of amber suppressor tRNA(Tyr) gene which yields high levels of mature tRNA(Tyr) should be useful for studying suppression in higher plants."

"2653826","abstracttext","We demonstrate here the in vitro translocation of yeast acid phosphatase into rough endoplasmic reticulum. The precursor of the repressible acid phosphatase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae encoded by the PHO5 gene, was synthesized in a yeast lysate programmed with in vitro transcribed PHO5 mRNA. In the presence of yeast rough microsomes up to 16% of the acid phosphatase synthesized was found to be translocated into the microsomes, as judged by proteinase resistance, and fully core-glycosylated. The translocation efficiency however, decreased to 3% if yeast rough microsomes were added after synthesis of acid phosphatase had been terminated. When a wheat-germ extract was used for in vitro synthesis, the precursor of acid phosphatase was translocated into canine pancreatic rough microsomes and thereby core-glycosylated in a signal-recognition-particle-dependent manner. Replacing canine with yeast rough microsomes in the wheat-germ translation system, however, resulted in a significant decrease in the ability to translocate and glycosylate the precursor. Translocation and glycosylation were partially restored by a high-salt extract prepared from yeast ribosomes. The results presented here suggest that yeast-specific factors are needed to translocate and glycosylate acid phosphatase efficiently in vitro."

"209044","abstracttext","Polysomes prepared from cultured Chinese hamster lung cells direct the synthesis of procollagen alpha chains in an heterologous cell-free system containing the postribosomal supernatant fraction prepared from wheat germ. Total protein synthesis requires both subcellular components and an exogenous energy source, and is inhibited by the antibiotics puromycin and aurin tricarboxylic acid. The ratio of collagenase-digestible to nondigestible material produced depends upon the wheat germ and not the polysome level in the reaction. Under optimal conditions, a significant fraction of the total product migrates on denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels as a single molecular weight collagenase-digestible species corresponding in size to the procollagen alpha chain (Mr approximately equal to 170,000). Approximately one-third of this high molecular weight material represents products whose synthesis results from cell-free mRNA initiation, and no distinct product larger than the 170,000-dalton material is observed. These studies confirm the initial observation that collagen represents one of the major gene products of Chinese hamster lung cells and demonstrate the usefulness of this cell line for the study of mammalian collagen biosynthesis."
"1531271","articletitle","An in vitro system for the editing of ATP synthase subunit 9 mRNA using wheat mitochondrial extracts."
"1531271","abstracttext","A posttranscriptional modification (C-to-U) at specific positions of plant mitochondrial mRNA leads to changes in the amino acid sequence as well as to the emergence of novel initiation or termination sites. This phenomenon, named RNA editing, has been described for several mitochondrial genes from different plant sources. We have found recently that RNA editing of the ATP synthase subunit 9 (atp9) mRNA involves eight changes including the creation of a new stop codon. In this article, we describe an in vitro system devised to follow the editing of wheat mitochondrial atp9 mRNA. Nonedited mRNA was obtained to serve as substrate for this reaction by in vitro transcription of the corresponding gene with T7 RNA polymerase. The source of conversion factor(s) was a soluble fraction obtained from purified wheat mitochondria lysed with salt and detergent. Edited RNA molecules were detected by hybridization with an end-labeled synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide probe complementary to a short region containing four editing events. Optimal conditions for the in vitro RNA editing reaction were determined. The reaction is sensitive to high temperature and protease digestion. Pretreatment with micrococcal nuclease decreased RNA editing activity in the mitochondrial extract, suggesting that a nucleic acid is necessary for the enzymatic reactions. Analysis of the edited mRNA showed that the in vitro reaction led to the same products as those observed in vivo."

"537913","abstracttext","Wheat and barley DNA enriched for ribosomal RNA genes was isolated from actinomycin D-CsCl gradients and used to clone the ribosomal repeating units in the plasmid pAC184. All five chimeric plasmids isolated which contained wheat rDNA and eleven of the thirteen which had barley rDNA were stable and included full length ribosomal repeating units. Physical maps of all length variants cloned have been constructed using the restriction endonucleases Eco Rl, Bam Hl, Bgl II, Hind III and Sal I. Length variation in the repeat units was attributed to differences in the spacer regions. Comparison of Hae III and Hpa II digestion of cereal rDNAs and the cloned repeats suggests that most methylated cytosines in natural rDNA are in -CpG-. Incomplete methylation occurs at specific Bam Hl sites in barley DNA. Detectable quantities of ribosomal spacer sequences are not present at any genomic locations other than those of the ribosomal RNA gene repeats."
"2467183","articletitle","Sequence heterogeneity and differential expression of the alpha-Amy2 gene family in wheat."
"2467183","abstracttext","The alpha-Amy2 genes of wheat are a multigene family which is expressed in the aleurone cells of germinating grain under control of the plant hormone gibberellin. A subset of the genes are also expressed in developing grain. Comparison of five genomic clones containing alpha-Amy2 genes, using DNA sequence analysis and Southern hybridisation, showed that the extent of similarity between genes differed. Two of the most heterogeneous genes compared were located to the same group 7 chromosome while the most similar genes alpha-Amy2/54 and alpha-Amy2/8 were located to different ones; hence sequence variation could not be correlated to the ancestry of the alpha-Amy2 genes during the separate existence of the constituent genomes of hexaploid wheat. Expression of the cloned genes was measured using an S1 nuclease protection assay and this identified alpha-Amy2/54 and alpha-Amy2/8 as part of the subset of alpha-Amy2 genes expressed in both the developing grain and in aleurone cells. Comparison of the 5' upstream regions of all five genes showed high similarity, with the exception of one gene, up to -280 nucleotides from the transcriptional start, while similarity between alpha-Amy2/54 and alpha-Amy2/8 extended a further 90 bp upstream of this point. It is suggested that regulatory elements responsible for tissue specificity and gibberellin regulation may be located within these regions of similarity."
"2196374","articletitle","Direct protein sequencing of wheat mitochondrial ATP synthase subunit 9 confirms RNA editing in plants."
"2196374","abstracttext","RNA editing, a process that results in the production of RNA molecules having a nucleotide sequence different from that of the initial DNA template, has been demonstrated in several organisms using different biochemical pathways. Very recently RNA editing was described in plant mitochondria following the discovery that the sequence of certain wheat and Oenothera cDNAs is different from the nucleotide sequence of the corresponding genes. The main conversion observed was C to U, leading to amino acid changes in the deduced protein sequence when these modifications occurred in an open reading frame. In this communication we show the first attempt to isolate and sequence a protein encoded by a plant mitochondrial gene. Subunit 9 of the wheat mitochondrial ATP synthase complex was purified to apparent homogeneity and the sequence of the first 32 amino acid residues was determined. We have observed that at position 7 leucine was obtained by protein sequencing, instead of the serine predicted from the previously determined genomic sequence. Also we found phenylalanine at position 28 instead of a leucine residue. Both amino acid conversions, UCA (serine) to UUA (leucine) and CUC (leucine) to UUC (phenylalanine), imply a C to U change. Thus our results seem to confirm, at the protein level, the RNA editing process in plant mitochondria."

"2180428","abstracttext","The cDNA encoding a precursor of wheat ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase was inserted in-phase with prokaryotic expression elements in four different vectors. Five expression vectors encoding the small subunit precursors were cloned in Escherichia coli. None of these constructs expressed detectable amounts of the precursor protein, but all directed synthesis of the mature small subunit. The expression of the small subunit was a consequence of an independent, intragenic Shine-Dalgarno sequence optimally located upstream from an ATG specifying the first codon of the mature small subunit portion in the precursor transcript. Similar internal translation signals have been identified in the nuclear-encoded cDNAs of the small-subunit precursors of numerous higher plant genes. The 5' end of the wheat small-subunit precursor was linked with a consensus E. coli DNA sequence such that the modified gene encoded a partial hybrid precursor carrying four additional residues at its amino terminus. The resultant construct, pEI-W3, directed abundant synthesis of both the partially hybrid small-subunit precursor and the mature small subunit, constituting as much as 10% of the total bacterial protein. The bacterially synthesized small subunit precursor was purified to homogeneity. The authenticity of the recombinant protein was verified by its size, immunological properties, amino-terminal sequence, and amino acid composition."

"2374706","abstracttext","Total transfer RNAs were extracted from highly purified potato mitochondria. From quantitative measurements, the in vivo tRNA concentration in mitochondria was estimated to be in the range of 60 microM. Total potato mitochondrial tRNAs were fractionated by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Thirty one individual tRNAs, which could read all sense codons, were identified by aminoacylation, sequencing or hybridization to specific oligonucleotides. The tRNA population that we have characterized comprises 15 typically mitochondrial, 5 'chloroplast-like' and 11 nuclear-encoded species. One tRNA(Ala), 2 tRNAs(Arg), 1 tRNA(Ile), 5 tRNAs(Leu) and 2 tRNAs(Thr) were shown to be coded for by nuclear DNA. A second, mitochondrial-encoded, tRNA(Ile) was also found. Five 'chloroplast-like' tRNAs, tRNA(Trp), tRNA(Asn), tRNA(His), tRNA(Ser)(GGA) and tRNA(Met)m, presumably transcribed from promiscuous chloroplast DNA sequences inserted in the mitochondrial genome, were identified, but, in contrast to wheat (1), potato mitochondria do not seem to contain 'chloroplast-like' tRNA(Cys) and tRNA(Phe). The two identified tRNAs(Val), as well as the tRNA(Gly), were found to be coded for by the mitochondrial genome, which again contrasts with the situation in wheat, where the mitochondrial genome apparently contains no tRNA(Val) or tRNA(Gly) gene (2)."
"1617740","articletitle","Nuclear genes control changes in the organization of the mitochondrial genome in tissue cultures derived from immature embryos of wheat."
"1617740","abstracttext","Although the mitochondrial genomes of the Chinese Spring and Aquila varieties of wheat are normally similar in organization, this is not so in tissue cultures initiated from their immature embryos where the mitochondrial genomes of both are rearranged and in different, characteristic, ways. However, the mitochondrial genomes of tissue cultures of reciprocal F1 crosses between these varieties were almost identical to one another, showing that nuclear genes control the rearrangement processes. These rearrangements are either due to the appearance of new structures or else result from changes in the relative amounts of subgenomic components. The severe reduction in the amount of certain molecular configurations in tissue cultures from reciprocal crosses is probably due to the presence of dominant information in the Aquila nuclear genome. Data obtained from tissue cultures initiated from F2 embryos of the cross Aquila x Chinese Spring suggest that at least two complementary genes are involved in this control. In contrast, the presence of new molecular arrangements appears to be under the control of a dominant allelic form of a Chinese Spring gene or genes. Thus, this study demonstrates that at least two sets of nuclear genes control the reorganization of the mitochondrial genome which occurs when tissue cultures are initiated from the immature embryos of wheat."
"1869585","articletitle","Determinants for cleavage of the chlorophyll a/b binding protein precursor: a requirement for a basic residue that is not universal for chloroplast imported proteins."
"1869585","abstracttext","We demonstrate that the precursor of the major light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b binding protein (LHCP of Photosystem II), encoded by a Type I gene, contains distinct determinants for processing at two sites during in vitro import into the chloroplast. Using precursors from both pea and wheat, it is shown that primary site processing, and release of a approximately 26-kD peptide, depends on an amino-proximal basic residue. Substitution of an arginine at position -4 resulted in an 80% reduction in processing, with the concomitant accumulation of a high molecular weight intermediate. Cleavage occurred normally when arginine was changed to lysine. The hypothesis that a basic residue is a general requirement for transit peptide removal was tested. We find that the precursors for the small subunit of Rubisco and Rubisco activase do not require a basic residue within seven amino acids of the cleavage site for maturation. In the wheat LHCP precursor, determinants for efficient cleavage at a secondary site were identified carboxy to the primary site, beyond what is traditionally called the transit peptide, within the sequence ala-lys-ala-lys (residues 38-41). Introduction of this sequence into the pea precursor, which has the residues thr-thr-lys-lys in the corresponding position, converted it to a substrate with an efficiently recognized secondary site. Our results indicate that two different forms of LHCP can be produced with distinct NH2-termini by selective cleavage of a single precursor polypeptide."

"7165690","abstracttext","Prolamin mixtures were isolated from oats, rice, normal and high-lysine sorghum, two varieties of pearl millet, two strains of teosinte, and gamma grass and subjected to NH2-terminal amino acid sequence determinations. In each case (except for rice, whose prolamins apparently have blocked or unavailable NH2-terminal residues), primarily a single sequence was observed despite significant heterogeneity, suggesting that prolamin homology in each cereal arose through duplication and mutation of a single ancestral gene. Comparisons were then made to prolamin sequences previously determined for wheat, corn, barley, and rye. Within genera, different varieties or subspecies exhibited few differences, but more distantly related genera, subtribes, and tribes showed increasingly large differences. Within the subfamily Festucoideae, no homology was apparent between prolamins of oats and those of the subtribe Triticinae (including wheat, rye, and barley, for which prolamin homology was previously demonstrated). Within the subfamily Panicoideae, corn was shown to be closely related to teosinte but more distantly to Tripsacum. Sorghum was shown to have diverged less from corn than had millet. These comparisons demonstrate that prolamin sequence analyses can successfully predict and clarify evolutionary relationships of cereals."

Endosperm protein components of isolines having blue aleurone due to the Agropyron chromosomes being added (2n=44) or translocated (2n=42) were compared to normal nonblue isoline counterparts. Gliadin proteins separated by aluminum lactate (pH 3.2) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) in one or two dimensions showed greater staining intensity for the blue addition isolines (2n=44) than nonblue (2n=42) isolines. However the 42-chromosome blue isoline did not show increased protein staining over the nonblue isoline, but at least five protein differences were detected between the lines. SDS-PAGE showed that blue and nonblue differences were expressed primarily in the gliadins, but also in the glutenin, globulin, and albumin proteins."

"7624381","abstracttext","The isozyme form of eukaryotic initiation factor 4F [eIF-(iso)4F] from wheat germ is composed of a p28 subunit that binds the 7-methylguanine cap of mRNA and a p86 subunit having unknown function. The p86 subunit was found to have limited sequence similarity to a kinesin-like protein encoded by the katA gene of Arabidopsis thaliana. Native wheat germ eIF-(iso)4F and bacterially expressed p86 subunit and p86-p28 complex bound to taxol-stabilized maize microtubules (MTs) in vitro. Binding saturation occurred at 1 mol of p86 per 5-6 mol of polymerized tubulin dimer, demonstrating a substoichiometric interaction of p86 with MTs. No evidence was found for a direct interaction of the p28 subunit with MTs. Unlike kinesin, cosedimentation of eIF-(iso)4F with MTs was neither reduced by MgATP nor enhanced by adenosine 5'-[gamma-imido]triphosphate. Both p86 subunit and p86-p28 complex induced the bundling of MTs in vitro. The p86 subunit was immunolocalized to the cytosol in root maize cells and existed in three forms: fine particles, coarse particles, and linear patches. Many coarse particles and linear patches were colocalized or closely associated with cortical MT bundles in interphase cells. The results indicate that the p86 subunit of eIF-(iso)4F is a MT-associated protein that may simultaneously link the translational machinery to the cytoskeleton and regulate MT disposition in plant cells."

"8499617","abstracttext","The promoter region (-524 to -46) of the wheat alpha/beta-gliadin seed storage protein gene was analyzed for interactions with nuclear proteins from developing wheat seeds. Six complexes were detected within the first 165 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. One of the proteins was a non-sequence specific AT-binding protein. The remaining five proteins bound in a sequence specific manner. One (CABP) mapped to a conserved CA-rich element at -134 to -112 while another (PalBP) mapped to an adjacent, palindromic sequence at -112 to -106. Three proteins (CTBPs 1-3) formed complexes at two, independent homologous sites. The activities of four of the binding proteins, CTBPs 1-3 and CABP, exhibited similar patterns of expression during seed development: they first appeared at early to mid stages, reached a maximum at mid stage and subsequently decreased, paralleling the pattern of gliadin mRNA accumulation. The non-specific AT-binding protein was detected at relatively high levels only at mid development. PalBP activity, on the other hand, first appeared at mid stage and was present at a constant level throughout later stages of development. The results suggest that the binding proteins may regulate gliadin expression in an antagonistic manner."
"8149826","articletitle","Perspectives for crop protection in sustainable agriculture."
"8149826","abstracttext","The challenge facing agriculture, particularly in developing countries, is to increase productivity without causing ecological damage. An important aspect of sustainable agriculture is the substitution of chemicals and capital with locally grown biological inputs and knowledge. Production of food grains in India has risen steadily since the 1960s, partly through the introduction of high-yielding varieties of rice and wheat together with appropriate agronomic and plant protection practices. Plant breeding programmes have improved cultivated rice by the transfer, from wild species, of genes conferring resistance to viral diseases. Diversification of resistance is sought, to render the hybrids less vulnerable to sudden outbreaks of diseases and insect pests. For wheat, resistance to rusts involves the additive interaction of several gene-encoded traits. Linkage of resistance genes with morphological markers enables the inheritance of the former to be followed easily. It is important that recent advances in molecular genetics are incorporated into integrated pest management programmes. This will require appropriate social organization. Research centres that develop and exploit genetic sources of resistance and varietal diversification should be established."
"9207035","articletitle","Plant ribosome shunting in vitro."
"9207035","abstracttext","It has been proposed that cauliflower mosaic virus 35S RNA with its 600 nt long leader uses an unusual translation process (the translational shunt). A wheat germ in vitro translation assay was used to improve the study of this mechanism. Deletions, the introduction of stable stem-loop structures, and the inhibitory effect of antisense oligonucleotides on gene expression were used to determine the roles of various parts of the leader. It was found that the 5'- and 3'-ends of the leader are absolutely required for translation whereas the middle part is apparently dispensable. These results confirm the data already reported from transient expression experiments with protoplasts. However, the in vitro data suggest in contrast to protoplast experiments that only two relatively short regions at both ends, approximately 100 nt each, are required. The in vitro system provides tools for further studying the shunt model at the molecular level and for examining the involvement of proteins in this mechanism. Shunting was also found to occur with the rice tungro bacilliform virus leader. As wheat is neither a host plant of cauliflower mosaic virus nor rice tungro bacilliform virus, the shunt seems to be host independent, a finding that deviates from earlier studies in protoplasts."

In order to investigate further the serine protease activity, a pea cotyledon germination cDNA library was, therefore, screened with a wheat cDNA (2437) [Baulcombe, D.C., Barker, R.F. & Jarvis, M.G.

"9335614","abstracttext","Detailed physical mapping of markers from rice chromosome 9, and from syntenous (at the genetic level) regions of other cereal genomes, has resulted in rice yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contigs spanning parts of rice 9. This physical mapping, together with comparative genetic mapping, has demonstrated that synteny has been largely maintained between the genomes of several cereals at the level of contiged YACs. Markers located in one region of rice chromosome 9 encompassed by the YAC contigs have exhibited restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) using deletion lines for the Ph1 locus. This has allowed demarcation of the region of rice chromosome 9 syntenous with the ph1b and ph1c deletions in wheat chromosome 5B. A group of probes located in wheat homoeologous group 5 and barley chromosome 5H, however, have synteny with rice chromosomes other than 9. This suggests that the usefulness of comparative trait analysis and of the rice genome as a tool to facilitate gene isolation will differ from one region to the next, and implies that the rice genome is more ancestral in structure than those of the Triticeae."

"9721675","abstracttext","Germin, a molecular marker of wheat embryo germination, is a protease-resistant, apoplastic, homopentameric glycoprotein with peroxide-generating oxalate oxidase activity. The spatial specificity of germin-like oxalate oxidase (gl-OXO) gene expression has been determined in tissues of germinating wheat embryos by a combination of histochemical, immunocytochemical and in situ hybridization techniques. The synthesis and accumulation of gl-OXO mRNA and protein is localised within the enveloping tissues of the embryonic axis (particularly the coleorhiza) during the first 24 h of imbibition. By 48 h germination, gl-OXO accumulation is detected throughout the root, with the exception of the postmitotic zone of cell elongation, where accumulation of its transcript is restricted to outer cell layers. At this time in the elongating shoot, gl-OXO is restricted to the coleoptile where it is detected only in the epidermal cell layer, the vascular bundles and bundle sheath cells. In older seedlings (approximately 9 days post-imbibition) gl-OXO activity is detected in leaves, but only within the vascular bundles. These patterns of expression are consistent with the hypothesis that the biological function of gl-OXO is to restrict cell growth by participating in cell-wall restructuring through the local provision of hydrogen peroxide for cross-linking of wall components."
"9647841","articletitle","Effect of Insertion Site and Metabolic Load on the Environmental Fitness of a Genetically Modified Pseudomonas fluorescens Isolate."
"9647841","abstracttext","An isolate of Pseudomonas fluorescens (SBW25) was modified with different marker genes (lacZY, aph-1, and xylE). These marker genes were inserted singly or in combination into two separate (1 Mbp apart) and presumably nonessential sites (-6- and Ee) on the chromosome of SBW25. This allowed the production of a range of genetically modified SBW25 variants that differed with respect to insertion site of the marker genes and metabolic burden. The environmental fitness of the different SBW25 variants was tested in soil, in the rhizosphere of wheat and pea, and on the phylloplane of wheat. Reduced environmental fitness of the different variants was mainly attributed to the extra metabolic burden of novel gene expression, whereas choice of insertion site was of little significance. Changes in environmental fitness were dependent on the environmental conditions; an environment, such as soil, with a low microbial carrying capacity had a negative effect on the environmental fitness of variants with a large metabolic load. In environments with a larger carrying capacity, such as the rhizosphere of pea, environmental fitness of variants with a large metabolic load was not significantly different from that of variants with a smaller metabolic burden."

"10455173","abstracttext","A new phytotoxic protein (cerato-platanin) of about 12.4 kDa has been identified in culture filtrates of the Ascomycete Ceratocystis fimbriata f. sp. platani, the causal agent of canker stain disease. The toxicity of the pure protein was bioassayed by detecting the inducing necrosis in tobacco leaves. The pure protein also elicited host synthesis of fluorescent substances in tobacco and plane (Platanus acerifolia) leaves. We purified the protein from culture medium to homogeneity. Its complete amino acid sequence was determined; this protein consists of 120 amino acid residues, contains 4 cysteines (S-S-bridged), and has a high percentage of hydrophobic residues. The molecular weight calculated from the amino acid sequence agrees with that determined by mass spectrometry, suggesting that no post-transnational modification occurs. Searches performed by the BLAST program in data banks (Swiss-Prot, EBI, and GenBank(TM)) revealed that this protein is highly homologous with two proteins produced by other Ascomycete fungi. One, produced during infection of wheat leaves, is codified by the snodprot1 gene of Phaeosphaeria nodorum (the causal agent of glume blotch of wheat), whereas the other is the rAsp f13 allergen from Aspergillus fumigatus. Furthermore, the N terminus of cerato-platanin is homologous with that of cerato-ulmin, a phytotoxic protein belonging to the hydrophobin family and produced by Ophiostoma (Ceratocystis) ulmi, a fungus responsible for Dutch elm disease."

They were highly similar to each other and to Hd1, and in addition harbored two conserved regions: two zinc finger motifs and CONSTANS, CONSTANS-LIKE and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (CCT) domain like CO/Hd1. They were located on the long arm of the homoeologous chromosome 6. TaHd1-2 harbored a 63-bp deletion at the promoter region containing the GATA-1 box, and consequently, we detected no subsequent transcript. The TaHd1-1 genomic clone was introduced to a rice line deficient in Hd1 function. Transgenic plants complemented the functions of rice Hd1: they promoted heading under short-day (SD) conditions and delayed it under long-day (LD)/natural conditions, indicating that Hd1 proteins from SD and LD plants share common structures and functions."

The labelling pattern revealed that the binding of wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL), peanut agglutinin (PNA), Bandeiraea simplicifolia lectin II (BSL II) and succinylated wheat germ agglutinin (SWGA) were increased in the lumenal surface of the ET in the D39 inoculated cohort compared to the uninfected control, which indicated that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and D-galactose residues were exposed. Concurrently, decreased labelling with Sambucus nigra agglutinin (SNA) indicated that there were few sialic acid residues remaining in the ET epithelium subsequent to i.n. inoculation with D39. The DeltaNA1 neuraminidase deficient mutant, however, did not induce any significant changes in the lectin labelling patterns, and was comparable to that of the control cohort. We propose that products of the nanA gene have a significant impact on the changes of the carbohydrate moieties in the ET epithelium and may be responsible for the previously reported increased ability of the D39 parent to colonize the nasopharynx and invade the middle ear."

"15355867","abstracttext_key results","High levels of polymorphism were found, with an average polymorphism information content of 0.52; an average of 4.77 alleles (range 2-11) were present at each locus, and half of these loci showed an additional allele in the reference variety 'Chinese Spring'."
"15355867","abstracttext_conclusions","'Barbela' is maintained from seeds collected by farmers, but it maintains high allelic variation, and no groupings of accessions were detected when analysed by geographical region, farm or climate, indicating that the wheat landrace is a homogeneous entity. The diversity within the farmer-maintained landrace demonstrates the importance of characterization and maintenance of landrace collections before valuable genetic combinations are lost as uniform commercial crops are introduced."

"12490151","articletitle","The architecture of interphase chromosomes and nucleolar transcription sites in plants."
"12490151","abstracttext","Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) coupled with confocal microscopy has been used to reveal the interphase chromosome organization in plants. In wheat and several other related species, we have shown that the interphase chromosomes are in a very well-defined organization, with centromeres and telomeres located at opposite sides of the nuclear envelope-a classic Rabl configuration. In transgenic wheat lines, FISH analysis of metaphase chromosomes has shown that multiple transgene copies can be integrated along a single chromosome, with large regions of intervening genomic sequence. These multiple copies are often colocalized in interphase, suggesting either an ectopic association or a highly reproducible interphase chromatin configuration. Bromo-uridine (BrU) incorporation has been used to label transcription sites in the nucleolus. Using pea root tissue, we have combined BrU incorporation with preembedding 1-nm gold detection to image the nucleolar transcription sites by electron microscopy. This has revealed many distinct elongated clusters of silver-gold particles. These clusters are 200-300 nm in length and are thicker at one end than the other. We suggest that each cluster corresponds to a single transcribed gene. Serial sectioning of several entire nucleoli has enabled the reconstruction of all the nucleolar transcription sites, and we have estimated that there are 200-300 transcribed genes per nucleolus."

"12378240","abstracttext","We applied SSR markers for mapping genes determining red coleoptile colour in wheat (Rc1, Rc2, Rc3) using F2 populations. All three genes map at about 15 to 20 cM distally from the centromere of chromosomes 7AS, 7BS and 7DS, respectively. The locations of the glume colour (Bg, Rg1) and glume hairiness (Hg) genes relative to the SSR markers of the homoeologous chromosomes group 1 were determined using molecular analysis of near-isogenic lines (NILs). One RAPD marker for the vernalisation response gene Vrn-A1 was identified by screening 95 random primers against two pairs of NILs. New PCR (STS) markers were developed based on RFLP-markers PSR426 (5A, 5B, 5D) and PSR1201 (1A, 5A, 5B). Analysis of nulli-tetrasomic and near-isogenic lines of wheat using the STS markers developed gave an indication that these new STS markers have the same chromosomal and intrachromosomal positions as the correspondent RFLP markers. Therefore, they could be used for mapping and/or tagging the vernalisation response (Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1) and homoeologous pairing (Ph1) genes."
"12354972","articletitle","Two Closely Related Wheat Storage Proteins Follow a Markedly Different Subcellular Route in Xenopus laevis Oocytes."
"12354972","abstracttext","[alpha]-Gliadins and [gamma]-gliadins are two closely related wheat storage proteins that evolved from a common ancestral gene. However, synthesis of [alpha]-gliadins and [gamma]-gliadins in Xenopus laevis oocytes revealed striking differences in their subcellular routing. The major portion of [alpha]-gliadin accumulated inside the oocyte, whereas most of the [gamma]-gliadin was secreted. Disruption of the Golgi apparatus by monensin revealed that the major part of secretion of [gamma]-gliadin is Golgi mediated. The difference in the subcellular route between [alpha]-gliadin and [gamma]-gliadin may be attributed to differential transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, a process that is generally the rate-limiting step in protein secretion. Coinjection of the two mRNAs had no effect on their routing, indicating no interaction between them. Our results support the hypothesis that subcellular transport of gliadins in wheat endosperm occurs in two separate routes; one is Golgi mediated, and the other is not. We also show that the subcellular transport may be markedly affected by small structural variations within closely related storage proteins."

Usefulness of random primers was also checked with other seed borne fungal pathogens of wheat and rice. None of primers gave amplification with Magnaporthe grisea, a causative agent of rice blast. However, distinct RAPD profiles were obtained with Alternaria triticina, Fusarium monaliforme, Helminthosporium sativum and Rhizoctonia solani. These six arbitrary primers could distinguish T. indica, a quarantine fungal pathogen from a non-quarantine fungal pathogen, T. barclayana. The two Tilletia sps. could be discriminated not only on the basis of distinct RAPD profiles, but also by presence of few unique gene fragments amplified using all six primers."
"12856949","articletitle","Characterization of two Myb-like transcription factors binding to CAB promoters in wheat and barley."
"12856949","abstracttext","The expression pattern and level of light-regulated genes are controlled by complex regulatory networks. Expression of genes encoding chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins of photosystem II is controlled by different photoreceptors and regulated primarily at the level of transcription. Light-dependent transcription of these genes is further modulated by the circadian system, affected by a developmental program and by a variety of environmental factors such as stress. Here we report the isolation of two Myb-like transcription factors from barley, HvMCB1 and HvMCB2, that bind specifically to defined regions of CAB promoters derived from wheat and barley. Deletion and mutation analysis of the wheat CAB1 promoter suggest that HvMCB1 and HvMCB2 are required for high-level but not for light- and circadian clock-regulated expression. Moreover, we demonstrate that the induction of HvMCB1 and HvMCB2 transcription is regulated differentially by environmental factors and plastid development. These observations indicate that HvMCB1 and HvMCB2, together with other, yet unknown regulatory factors, may mediate responsiveness of CAB gene transcription to a variety of environmental and developmental signals."

"15794761","abstracttext","The xylanase inhibitor protein I (XIP-I), recently identified in wheat, inhibits xylanases belonging to glycoside hydrolase families 10 (GH10) and 11 (GH11). Sequence and structural similarities indicate that XIP-I is related to chitinases of family GH18, despite its lack of enzymatic activity. Here we report the identification and biochemical characterization of a XIP-type inhibitor from rice. Despite its initial classification as a chitinase, the rice inhibitor does not exhibit chitinolytic activity but shows specificities towards fungal GH11 xylanases similar to that of its wheat counterpart. This, together, with an analysis of approximately 150 plant members of glycosidase family GH18 provides compelling evidence that xylanase inhibitors are largely represented in this family, and that this novel function has recently emerged based on a common scaffold. The plurifunctionality of GH18 members has major implications for genomic annotations and predicted gene function. This study provides new information which will lead to a better understanding of the biological significance of a number of GH18 'inactivated' chitinases."
"15765225","articletitle","Allelic variation at the linked AP1 and PhyC loci in hexaploid wheat is associated but not perfectly correlated with vernalization response."
"15765225","abstracttext","Vernalization requirement is an important trait in temperate crop plants such as wheat and must be considered when selecting varieties for cultivation under different climatic conditions. To determine the growth habit of wheat varieties, plants need to be grown under different vernalization regimes, a lengthy but necessary process for breeders involved in crossing winter with spring germplasm. If haplotypes can be associated with growth habit, then molecular marker assays that are reliable, cheap, and quick can be developed to assist in the selection of plants with the desired phenotype. We have analyzed 81 accessions that have different vernalization requirements and putative different origins of spring habit for sequence variation at the Apetala1 (AP1) locus, which underlies Vrn-1, and at the linked Phytochrome C (PhyC) locus. Good correspondence was found between the AP1 genotype and the PhyC haplotype for 77 of the 81 accessions. Two varieties displayed a recombination event between the AP1 and PhyC loci, and one variety carried a recombinant PhyC gene. In addition, one variety carried an apparent AP1 winter allele, but displayed the Vrn-A1 spring habit. The PhyC haplotype for this variety also indicated the presence of a Vrn-A1 spring allele. Our data suggest that both the AP1 promoter region and PhyC SNPs can be used as diagnostic markers for vernalization response at the vrn-A1 locus, but that neither are perfect tags."

"16027977","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is an important disease of wheat caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. This pathogen invades exclusively epidermal cells after penetrating directly through the cell wall. Because powdery mildew colonizes exclusively epidermal cells, it is of importance not only to identify genes which are activated, but also to monitor tissue specificity of gene activation. Acquired resistance of wheat to powdery mildew can be induced by a previous inoculation with the non-host pathogen B. graminis f. sp. hordei, the causal agent of barley powdery mildew. The establishment of the resistant state is accompanied by the activation of genes. Here we report the tissue-specific cDNA-AFLP analysis and cloning of transcripts accumulating 6 and 24 h after the resistance-inducing inoculation with B. graminis f. sp. hordei. A total of 25,000 fragments estimated to represent about 17,000 transcripts were displayed. Out of these, 141 transcripts, were found to accumulate after Bgh inoculation using microarray hybridization analysis. Forty-four accumulated predominantly in the epidermis whereas 76 transcripts accumulated mostly in mesophyll tissue."

"14736371","abstracttext","Genetic structure of Hessian flies in Tunisia. The genetic structure of M. destructor and M. hordei was investigated by sampling 21 fields of cereals in 14 localities of central and southern Tunisia. As previously shown, there was no strict association between the cereal species (wheat, barley and oat) and the Mayetiola species. M. destructor males displayed no heterozygosity at the Pgm3 locus, indicating that they were hemizygous as is the PGM locus in North America. In M. hordei, heterozygous males were observed at all loci, but strong heterozygote deficits were found at two loci (Mdh2 et Hk). Since no such deficit was observed in females, the population structure of M. hordei was studied only in females. Although heterozygosity was two fold higher in M. hordei than in M. destructor, the two species were similar for other genetic characteristics, including a low (Fst<0.05) but significant (P<0.05) genetic differentiation, no isolation by distance, and similar rates of gene flow (5.7 <or=Nm <or=9.6). These results are discussed in relation to their consequences in the event of controlling Tunisian Hessian flies using wheat cultivars that are resistant to a M. destructor biotype."

"15194492","abstracttext","Blue-light-induced photomorphogenesis is the sum total of a sequence of phenomena involving absorption of light by specific receptors, generation of a signal, processing transmembrane transport of signal, and the activation of a cascade of reactions in the cell interior. Though four blue-light receptors cryptochrome1, cryptochrome2, phototropin1, and phototropin2 have been identified, the signal transduction events associated with blue-light receptor activation are not understood. In this report, we demonstrate the generation and spatiotemporal distribution of H(2)O(2) in wheat coleoptile in response to blue light. Interception of the free-radical generation pathways dithiothreitol and propyl gallate rendered wheat coleoptile tips phototropically non-responsive. Unilateral application of H(2)O(2) onto the sub-apical region of a growing coleoptile brought about curvature in dark. Blue light also caused lipid peroxidation and augmented membrane rigidity of coleoptile cell membranes. We conclude that H(2)O(2) can act as a translocating second messenger that could bring about coleoptile curvature, and the signaling events may trigger Ca(2+) signaling cascades, changes in gene expression, and protein modifications."

"14970930","abstracttext","We tested the importance of microenvironmental topographic parameters as predictors of emmer wheat genetic variation using three classes of single-locus (or at most several-loci) genetic markers (allozymes, glutenins, and qualitative traits) and two classes of markers of polygenic inheritance (phenological and morphological traits). Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) and redundancy analysis (RDA) detected a significant effect of spatially structured environmental variation on genetic differences between plants for allozymes, glutenins, and quantitative morphological and phenological traits. However, after removing a spatial component of variation in partial CCA and partial RDA, the relationship of the remaining environmental variation with these genetic markers could be explained by chance alone, allowing us to rule out microniche topographic specialization in emmer wheat. Topographic autocorrelation exhibited a certain degree of similarity with genetic marker autocorrelation, indicating similar scales of environmental heterogeneity and seed flow. The detected population genetic structure agrees with one expected under isolation by distance as a result of limited gene flow. A negative relationship of genetic similarity with the logarithm of distance between plants was detected for both molecular markers and quantitative traits, which differed in the strength but not the pattern of association."

"15010599","abstracttext","Transcript profile and post-transcriptional processing of the mitochondrial orf156 were compared among the nucleus-cytoplasm (NC) hybrids of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat and their parental lines. These NC hybrids, in which the plasmon from the maternal Aegilops squarrosa parent is combined with the nuclear genomes of the paternal parents, and their parental lines were previously shown to have heteroplasmic copies of the polycistronic transcriptional unit nad3-orf156 in different sub-stoichiometries. Despite the heteroplasmic conditions, only single transcript types were detected among reverse transcription-PCR products of the orf156 mRNA in the respective lines. In the NC hybrids only a major maternal copy was transcribed and edited, likewise in the parental lines only single major copies were transcribed and edited. RNA gel blot analysis using the orf156 probe showed that the NC hybrids had the transcripts similar to the parental lines but unlike the maternal line. Primer extension analysis further revealed the orf156 transcripts with different 5' termini, which most probably resulted from the alternative post-transcriptional cleavages of the precursor mRNA. These cleaved transcripts were polymorphic not only among the lines but also among four different tissues. The cleavages were highly selective and the paternal-type cleavages predominated in the NC hybrids, irrespective of the tissues studied. This seemingly neutral polymorphisms in wheat could make this system convenient for further analysis of mitochondrial gene expression in plants."

"14975404","abstracttext","Thylakoid membrane dismantling and Lhcb and RbcS nuclear gene expression have been analysed in leaves of wheat plants grown in high fluence rate light and deprived of photoprotective carotenoids by treatments with the two bleaching herbicides, either norflurazon or amitrole. The Lhcb transcript was not detectable in cells of norflurazon-supplied leaves, having chloroplasts totally devoid of both inner membranes and pigments. In contrast, a substantial amount of Lhcb mRNA could be found in cells of amitrole-treated leaves, whose severely damaged organelles still contained few strikingly altered and photosynthetically unfunctional thylakoids, as well as chlorophyll traces. A possible relationship between chlorophyll synthesis and Lhcb expression, with the transcript level depending on the rate of pigment production in photodamaged chloroplasts is discussed. Also the RbcS expression was linked to the chloroplast membrane photodamage. However, a detectable level of transcript was still produced in norflurazon-treated cells, despite complete thylakoid demolition. Thus, the wheat cell behaviour had to be placed between that of species, such as maize, in which the RbcS expression is broken off in these conditions, and that of species, such as pea, in which it is slightly lowered. Interestingly, the dramatically photodamaged chloroplasts still maintained the ability to synthesize proteins and this allowed SSU and LSU Rubisco subunits to be found in the organelles of both norflurazon- and amitrole-treated plants."

Upon infection of these plants, Ti plasmid DNA sequence is stably transferred (T-DNA) by unknown mechanisms to plant cells to be integrated into nuclear DNA. The T-DNA processing and transfer require the expression of vir (virulence) genes on the Ti plasmid, which are known to be induced by certain phenolic compounds released from cells at the wounded inoculation site. The results of the present study demonstrate that wheat and oats contain a substance(s) that induces vir gene expression, yet the inducing substance of wheat differs from the phenolic inducers in that it is hydrophilic and has a molecular weight of several thousand. The novel inducer was not detectable in the exudates of seedlings of these plants but was found in an extract from the transition region between shoot and root of the seedlings and also in extracts from the seeds, bran, and germ. This finding suggests that T-DNA processing and possibly its transfer should take place when Agrobacterium invades suitable tissues of monocotyledonous plants."

"16214369","abstracttext","The gene encoding the repetitive domain located in the N-terminal half of gamma-Gliadin from wheat endosperm has been subcloned into a thioredoxin expression system (pET102/D-Topo). It was over-expressed as fusion protein with thioredoxin in Escherichia coli. Thioredoxin was removed by enterokinase cleavage or by acid cleavage at the respective engineered recognition sites. The soluble N-terminal half of gamma-Gliadin was purified by affinity and reverse-phase chromatography. While, the enterokinase cleavage leaded to only one species detectable by mass spectroscopy, the acid cleavage resulted in a three different length polypeptides, due to the presence of the same number of acid cleavage sites. The secondary structure of the purified protein domain was analysed by circular dichroism, showing an spectral shape common to a Poly(Pro) II conformation. The spectrum is dominated by a large negative peak centred around 201 nm and a broad shoulder centred around 225 nm. Also, the temperature denaturation process was studied. The differences observed in the spectra show two main tendencies, the increment of the shoulder intensity, and the drop of the intensity of the peak around 201. When the sample was cooled down, the change on intensity of the shoulder around 225 was completely reversible and that around the 201 nm peak reached a reversibility of 90%. Such structure and thermal behaviour are characteristic of the repetitive domains of the wheat prolamins."

Fluorescent in situ hybridization on salivary polytenes positioned MdesL1 on the long arm of Autosome 1. BLASTp and conserved domain searches revealed the deduced amino acid sequence contained a lipase superfamily domain with similarity to lipases and phospholipases from other insects. A secretion signal peptide was identified at the amino terminus of the deduced amino acid sequence. Analysis of the transcript of MdesL1 in larval Hessian fly tissues by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) revealed the greatest abundance was in salivary glands. Analysis of transcript levels during development showed the greatest level was detected in feeding 1st-instar and early 2nd-instar larvae. Transcript levels increased dramatically over time in larvae feeding on susceptible wheat but were detected at low levels in larvae feeding on resistant wheat. These data suggest the protein encoded by MdesL1 is likely secreted into host-plant cells during larval feeding and could be involved in extra-oral digestion and changes in host-cell permeability or in generating a second messenger in a host-cell-signaling cascade."

The objective of this research was to evaluate the role of host sensitivity to toxin, conditioned by a single dominant gene on chromosome 5BL, in the disease development by race 2. An F(2)-derived F(6) recombinant inbred population of 108 wheat lines, produced from crosses of toxin-sensitive, disease-susceptible cv. Kulm with the toxin-insensitive, disease-resistant cv. Erik segregated 1:1 for toxin reaction. However, the population was skewed toward resistance to race 2 of the fungus. Toxin reaction accounted for 24.4% of the genetic variance for disease. Heritability estimates suggested the presence of four to five genes that influence disease reaction in the population. Toxin-insensitive mutants, previously derived Kulm, were susceptible to race 2, although disease developed more slowly on the mutants than it did on the wild-type Kulm. The data indicate that sensitivity to Ptr ToxA influences disease severity in some host genotypes without defining susceptibility."

"18944643","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Infectious RNA of wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) has been produced using a full-length cDNA clone as a template for in vitro transcription with SP6 RNA polymerase. Infectivity was dependent on the use of template plasmid DNA that had not undergone spontaneous rearrangement during amplification in Escherichia coli. The presence of WSMV in systemically infected wheat plants inoculated with in vitro transcripts was confirmed by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction of the WSMV P3 gene and by accumulation of WSMV coat protein as detected by immunoblotting. Maintenance of the full-length WSMV cDNA in the high copy number plasmid pUC18 was problematic because of spontaneous rearrangement of WSMV sequences during growth in liquid media for more than 8 h or if the clone was subcultured. Stability of the WSMV cDNA clone was improved by the use of the low copy number plasmid pACYC177, and it could be grown in large scale volumes (up to 1 liter) of liquid culture for 14 h without noticeable rearrangements. Both the original WSMV culture and the progeny virus derived from infectious in vitro transcripts were efficiently transmitted by the natural eriophyid mite vector Aceria tosichella. This is the first report of infectious in vitro transcripts for any eriophyid mite-transmitted plant virus and represents the only monopartite member of the family Potyviridae infecting monocotyledonous hosts for which infectious in vitro transcripts are available."

"18928198","abstracttext","Microsatellites are abundant across prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. However, comparative analysis of microsatellites in the organellar genomes of plants and their utility in understanding phylogeny has not been reported. The purpose of this study was to understand the organization of microsatellites in the coding and non-coding regions of organellar genomes of major cereals viz., rice, wheat, maize and sorghum. About 5.8-14.3% of mitochondrial and 30.5-43.2% of chloroplast microsatellites were observed in the coding regions. About 83.8-86.8% of known mitochondrial genes had at least one microsatellite while this value ranged from 78.6-82.9% among the chloroplast genomes. Dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant in the coding and non-coding regions of the mitochondrial genome while mononucleotides were predominant in chloroplast genomes. Maize harbored more repeats in the mitochondrial genome, which could be due to the larger size of genome. A phylogenetic analysis based on mitochondrial and chloroplast genomic microsatellites revealed that rice and sorghum were closer to each other, while wheat was the farthest and this corroborated with the earlier reported phylogenies based on nuclear genome co-linearity and chloroplast gene-based analysis."

In this study we considered other wheat OMT genes - TaOMT3, TaOMT4, and TaOMT5 - using a bioinformatics approach and examined the TaOMT genes for their genomic organization, tissue-specific expression, responses to abiotic stresses and hormones, and cis-elements. There appeared to be a homoeologous relationship between TaOMT4 (6DS) and TaOMT5 (6BS), whereas TaOMT1 and TaOMT3 were placed on chromosome arms 7BL and 5DL, respectively. Differences in the tissue-specific, constitutive, and stress-inducible expression patterns among the TaOMT genes were found in both healthy and stressed plants. A number of cis-elements, which are potentially correlated with the responses of the TaOMT genes, were detected in the analysis of the TaOMT promoter sequences.

Case studies consisting of parent-progeny cultivar trios and pairs, identified on the basis of their registered pedigree, were studied to evaluate the probability of ancestry of each progeny cultivar, compared with all the remaining accessions. Rare alleles and haplotype sharing were also explored. When the results did not agree with the registered parentages, SSR markers provided information with which to identify the most probable parents (or the corresponding ""breeding lineages"") in the collection."
"16937050","articletitle","Isolation and characterisation of two wheat beta-expansin genes expressed during male gametophyte development."
"16937050","abstracttext","Two novel beta-expansin genes, TaEXPB1 and TaEXPB2, were isolated from wheat microspores by suppression subtractive hybridisation. Northern blot and reverse transcription PCR analyses showed that the expression of both genes was restricted to early stages of male gametophyte development (from microspores to immature pollen). A homology search showed high similarity of the newly discovered genes to generative beta-expansins in grass pollen (group 1 pollen allergens). Southern hybridisation revealed that the isolated genes belong to a distinct group within the subfamily of beta-expansin genes in the wheat genome. A comparison of full-length cDNAs with the corresponding genomic sequences showed that there are two introns in the TaEXPB1 gene, whereas TaEXPB2 has three introns. Both genes were predicted to encode highly similar basic proteins (pI 9.0) with molecular masses of approximately 29 kDa consisting of a signal peptide, catalytic, and polysaccharide binding domains, which include conserved cysteines and tryptophans and motifs characteristic for beta-expansins."
"16928694","articletitle","Sequence upstream of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) ALMT1 gene and its relationship to aluminum resistance."
"16928694","abstracttext","Aluminum (Al) resistance in wheat relies on the Al-activated malate efflux from root apices, which appears to be controlled by an Al-activated anion transporter encoded by the ALMT1 gene on chromosome 4DL. Genomic regions upstream and downstream of ALMT1 in 69 wheat lines were characterized to identify patterns that might influence ALMT1 expression. The first 1,000 bp downstream of ALMT1 was conserved among the lines examined apart from the presence of a transposon-like sequence which did not correlate with Al resistance. In contrast, the first 1,000 bp upstream of the ALMT1 coding region was more variable and six different patterns could be discerned (types I-VI). Type I had the simplest structure, while the others had blocks of sequence that were duplicated or triplicated in different arrangements. A pattern emerged among the lines of non-Japanese origin such that the number of repeats in this upstream region was positively correlated with the levels of ALMT1 expression and Al resistance. In contrast, many of the Japanese lines exhibited a large variation in ALMT1 expression and Al resistance despite possessing the same type of upstream region. Although ALMT1 expression was also poorly correlated with Al-activated malate efflux in the Japanese lines, a strong correlation between malate efflux and Al resistance suggested that malate efflux was still the primary mechanism for Al resistance, and that additional genes are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of ALMT1 function."

"17497174","abstracttext","Advances in plant genomics have permitted the analysis of several members of the grass family, including the major domesticated species, and provided new insights into the evolution of the major crops on earth. Two members, colonial bentgrass (Agrostis capillaris L.) and creeping bentgrass (A. stolonifera L.) have only recently been domesticated and provide an interesting case of polyploidy and comparison to crops that have undergone human selection for thousands of years. As an initial step of characterizing these genomes, we have sampled roughly 10% of their gene content, thereby also serving as a starting point for the construction of their physical and genetic maps. Sampling mRNA from plants subjected to environmental stress showed a remarkable increase in transcription of transposable elements. Both colonial and creeping bentgrass are allotetraploids and are considered to have one genome in common, designated the A2 genome. Analysis of conserved genes present among the ESTs suggests the colonial and creeping bentgrass A2 genomes diverged from a common ancestor approximately 2.2 million years ago (MYA), thereby providing an enhanced evolutionary zoom in respect to the origin of maize, which formed 4.8 MYA, and tetraploid wheat, which formed only 0.5 MYA and is the progenitor of domesticated hexaploid wheat."

Poly(A)(+) RNA was isolated from roots, expanding leaves, and old leaves from amphiploid and Chinese Spring plants prior to and after acclimation to high levels of NaCl in solution cultures. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of the in vitro translation products was used to compare these mRNA populations. The amphiploid had 10 mRNA species induced or enhanced and 8 species repressed in root tissue during acclimation to saline growth conditions. These 18 transcripts affected by salt treatment were also detected in wheat roots, but only 4 of these were similarly regulated. In Chinese Spring the acclimation to saline stress resulted in a marked change in the level of expression of 34 transcripts in root tissue; of these, 26 were detected in the amphiploid and only 6 were regulated as in the amphiploid. No differences were seen in gene expression between salt-treated and control plants in leaves and meristematic crowns and unexpanded leaves of the amphiploid."

The cells were inoculated onto winter wheat seeds and the GMM cells (SBW25:tgl) were monitored in the field from September 2005 to May 2006 using plating, luminometry and microscopic analyses. Cell numbers were high on all sampling occasions and metabolically active cells were detected on all plant parts. Field results were similar to those obtained in a parallel phytotron study, although the amount of SBW25:tgl detected on shoots was significantly higher in the phytotron than in the field. After winter, cell counts were 100-fold higher on the roots and root-associated soil compared with prewinter measurements, although the cells had a lower relative metabolic activity. The wheat seeds were naturally infested with Microdochium nivale, but no treatment resulted in reduction of disease symptoms. No SWB25:tgl cells were ever found in bulk soil or uninoculated plants. The Swedish field trial results complement and contrast with prior field studies performed with the same parent organism in the United Kingdom under different soil, plant and climatic conditions."
"18030508","articletitle","The PIP and TIP aquaporins in wheat form a large and diverse family with unique gene structures and functionally important features."
"18030508","abstracttext","Aquaporins, members of major intrinsic proteins (MIPs), transport water across cellular membranes and play vital roles in all organisms. Adversities such as drought, salinity, or chilling affect water uptake and transport, and numerous plant MIPs are reported to be differentially regulated under such stresses. However, MIP genes have been not yet been characterized in wheat, the largest cereal crop. We have identified 24 PIP and 11 TIP aquaporin genes from wheat by gene isolation and database searches. They vary extensively in lengths, numbers, and sequences of exons and introns, and sequences and cellular locations of predicted proteins, but the intron positions (if present) are characteristic. The putative PIP proteins show a high degree of conservation of signature sequences or residues for membrane integration, water transport, and regulation. The TIPs are more diverse, some with potential for water transport and others with various selectivity filters including a new combination. Most genes appear to be expressed as expressed sequence tags, while two are likely pseudogenes. Many of the genes are highly identical to rice but some are unique, and many correspond to genes that show differential expression under salinity and/or drought. The results provide extensive information for functional studies and developing markers for stress tolerance."

"17980386","abstracttext","We report on the transcriptional patterns of a putative white (w) gene encoding an ABC-active-transporter protein during development in Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor. The deduced amino acid sequence for the Hessian fly white showed 74-77% similarities to white/ATP-binding-cassette proteins and 52-57% similarities to scarlet/ATP-binding-cassette proteins from other dipterans. Conserved ATP-binding motifs and transmembrane alpha-helix segments were identified in the Hessian fly white protein further supporting its function as an ABC-active-transporter similar to the Drosophila white protein. Spatial analysis of transcript levels for white in larval Hessian fly tissues by quantitative real-time PCR revealed the greatest level of transcript in the Malpighian tubules, while analysis of temporal expression during development revealed the highest transcript levels in late 2nd- and early 3rd-instar larvae. Analysis of transcript levels for white in Hessian fly larvae feeding on susceptible and resistant wheat showed greater levels of the transcript in larvae feeding on resistant plants. We speculate the increased transcript level for white in larvae feeding on resistant wheat could be correlated with stress and increased Malpighian tubule activity associated with the metabolism and detoxification of toxic substrates generated either endogenously or encountered exogenously from the host plant."

Brachypodium distachyon, a close relative of those cereals has recently emerged as a model for grass functional genomics. Sequencing of the nuclear and organelle genomes of Brachypodium is one of the first steps towards making this species available as a tool for researchers interested in cereals biology."
"18710514","abstracttext_findings","The chloroplast genome of Brachypodium distachyon was sequenced by a combinational approach using BAC end and shotgun sequences derived from a selected BAC containing the entire chloroplast genome. Comparative analysis indicated that the chloroplast genome is conserved in gene number and organization with respect to those of other cereals. However, several Brachypodium genes evolve at a faster rate than those in other grasses. Sequence analysis reveals that rice and wheat have a ~2.1 kb deletion in their plastid genomes and this deletion must have occurred independently in both species."
"18710514","abstracttext_conclusion","We demonstrate that BAC libraries can be used to sequence plastid, and likely other organellar, genomes. As expected, the Brachypodium chloroplast genome is very similar to those of other sequenced grasses. The phylogenetic analyses and the pattern of insertions and deletions in the chloroplast genome confirmed that Brachypodium is a close relative of the tribe Triticeae. Nevertheless, we show that some large indels can arise multiple times and may confound phylogenetic reconstruction."

One hundred seventy-six RILs from the cross Colosseo x Lloyd were tested under artificial rust inoculation in the field. The response at the seedling stage was also investigated. A major QTL (QLr.ubo-7B.2) for leaf rust resistance controlling both the seedling and the adult open field based-response was mapped on 7BL, with the favourable allele inherited from Colosseo. QLr.ubo-7B.2 showed R2 and LOD peak values for the area under disease progress curve (AUDPC) equal to 72.9% and 44.5, respectively. The presence and location of QLr.ubo-7B.2 was validated by a linkage disequilibrium-based test using two-year field data of 62 advanced lines from 21 crosses with Creso, Colosseo or Plinio as resistance donors. QLr.ubo-7B.2 maps in a gene-dense region (7BL10-0.78-1.00) carrying several genes/QTLs in wheat and barley for resistance to rusts and other fungal diseases."

NBS (nucleotide-binding site) profiling is a PCR (polymerase chain reaction)-based approach to studying genetic variability that specifically targets chromosome regions containing R-genes and R-gene analogues. We used NBS profiling to measure genetic diversity among 58 accessions of durum wheat. Mean polymorphism rates detected using MseI and AluI as restriction enzymes were 34% and 22%, respectively. Mean number of polymorphisms per enzyme-primer combination was equal to 23.8 +/- 5.9, ranging from 13 to 31 polymorphic bands. In total, 96 markers over 190 indicated a good capacity to discriminate between accessions (the polymorphic index content ranging from 0.30 to 0.50). The results obtained with NBS profiling were compared with simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data of the same set of accessions. The genetic distances computed with 190 NBS profiling markers were in close agreement with those obtained with AFLP and SSR markers (r = 0.73 and 0.76, respectively). Our results indicate that NBS profiling provides an effective means to investigate genetic diversity in durum wheat."

"20129398","abstracttext","Vacuolar H(+)-translocating pyrophosphatase (V-PPase) is a key enzyme related to plant growth as well as abiotic stress tolerance. In this work, wheat V-PPase genes TaVP1, TaVP2 and TaVP3 were identified. TaVP1 and TaVP2 are more similar to each other than to TaVP3. Their deduced polypeptide sequences preserve the topological structure and essential residues of V-PPases. Phylogenetic studies suggested that monocot plants, at least monocot grasses, have three VP paralogs. TaVP3 transcripts were only detected in developing seeds, and no TaVP2 transcripts were found in germinating seeds. TaVP2 was mainly expressed in shoot tissues and down-regulated in leaves under dehydration. Its expression was up-regulated in roots under high salinity. TaVP1 was relatively more ubiquitously and evenly expressed than TaVP2. Its expression level in roots was highest among the tissues examined, and was inducible by salinity stress. These results indicated that the V-PPase gene paralogs in wheat are differentially regulated spatially and in response to dehydration and salinity stresses."

"20507460","abstracttext","SUMMARY Fusarium graminearum is the main causative agent of Fusarium head blight on small grain cereals and of ear rot on maize. The disease leads to dramatic yield losses and to an accumulation of mycotoxins. The most dominant F. graminearum mycotoxins are the trichothecenes, with deoxynivalenol and nivalenol being the most prevalent derivatives. To investigate the involvement of trichothecenes in the virulence of the pathogen, the gene coding for the initial enzyme of the trichothecene pathway was disrupted in three field isolates, differing in chemotype and in virulence. From each isolate three individual disruption mutants were tested for their virulence on wheat, barley and maize. Despite the different initial virulence of the three wild-type progenitor strains on wheat, all disruption mutants caused disease symptoms on the inoculated spikelet, but the symptoms did not spread into other spikelets. On barley, the trichothecene deficient mutants showed no significant difference compared to the wild-type strains: all were equally aggressive. On maize, mutants derived from the NIV-producing strain caused less disease than their wild-type progenitor strain, while mutants derived from DON-producing strains caused the same level of disease as their progenitor strains. These data demonstrate that trichothecenes influence the virulence of F. graminearum in a highly complex manner, which is strongly host as well as moderately chemotype specific."
"20521949","articletitle","Involvement of salicylate and jasmonate signaling pathways in Arabidopsis interaction with Fusarium graminearum."
"20521949","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the principal causative agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB), a devastating disease of wheat and barley. This fungus can also colonize Arabidopsis thaliana. Disease resistance was enhanced in transgenic wheat and Arabidopsis plants that constitutively overexpress the NONEXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS-RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1) gene, which regulates salicylic acid (SA) signaling and modulates the activation of jasmonic acid (JA)-dependent defenses. Here, we provide several lines of evidence that reveal an important role for SA and JA signaling in Arabidopsis defense against F. graminearum. SA level was elevated in fungus-inoculated leaves, and SA application and biologically activated systemic acquired resistance enhanced resistance. Furthermore, the disruption of SA accumulation and signaling in the sid2 mutant and NahG transgenic plant, and the npr1 and wrky18 mutants, respectively, resulted in heightened susceptibility to this fungus in leaves and inflorescence. JA signaling was activated in parallel with SA signaling in the fungus-challenged plants. However, the hyperresistance of the JA pathway mutants opr3, coi1, and jar1 indicates that this pathway contributes to susceptibility. Genetic and biochemical experiments indicate that the JA pathway promotes disease by attenuating the activation of SA signaling in fungus-inoculated plants. However, the hypersusceptibility of the jar1 npr1 double mutant compared with the npr1 mutant suggests that JAR1 also contributes to defense, signifying a dichotomous role of JA and a JAR1-dependent mechanism in this interaction."

"19719605","abstracttext","Abstract The interactions between maize, sorghum, wheat and rice plants and Herbaspirillum seropedicae were examined microscopically following inoculation with the H. seropedicae LR15 strain, a Nif(+) (Pnif::gusA) mutant obtained by the insertion of a gusA-kanamycin cassette into the nifH gene of the H. seropedicae wild-type strain. The expression of the Pnif::gusA fusion was followed during the association of the diazotroph with the gramineous species. Histochemical analysis of seedlings of maize, sorghum, wheat and rice grown in vermiculite showed that strain LR15 colonized root surfaces and inner tissues. In early steps of the endophytic association, H. seropedicae colonized root exudation sites, such as axils of secondary roots and intercellular spaces of the root cortex; it then occupied the vascular tissue and there expressed nif genes. The expression of nif genes occurred in roots, stems and leaves as detected by the GUS reporter system. The expression of nif genes was also observed in bacterial colonies located in the external mucilaginous root material, 8 days after inoculation. Moreover, the colonization of plant tissue by H. seropedicae did not depend on the nitrogen-fixing ability, since similar numbers of cells were isolated from roots or shoots of the plants inoculated with Nif(+) or Nif(-) strains."

"19895399","abstracttext","A salinity stress upregulated expressed sequence tag (EST) was selected from a suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA library, constructed from the salinity-tolerant wheat cultivar Shanrong No. 3. Sequence analysis showed that the corresponding gene (named TaDi19A) belonged to the Di19 family. TaDi19A was constitutively expressed in both the root and leaf of wheat seedlings grown under non-stressed conditions, but was substantially up-regulated by the imposition of stress (salinity, osmotic stress and cold), or the supply of stress-related hormones [abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene]. The heterologous over-expression of TaDi19A in Arabidopsis thaliana increased the plants' sensitivity to salinity stress, ABA and mannitol during the germination stage. Root elongation in these transgenic lines showed a reduced tolerance to salinity stress and a reduced sensitivity to ethophon. The expression of the ABA signal pathway genes ABI1, RAB18, ERD15 and ABF3, and SOS2 (SOS pathway) was altered in the transgenic lines. TaDi19A plays a role in the plant's response to abiotic stress, and some possible mechanisms of its action are proposed."

"19578911","abstracttext","DNA binding with One Finger (Dof) protein is a plant-specific transcription factor implicated in the regulation of many important plant-specific processes, including photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. This study has identified 31 Dof genes (TaDof) in bread wheat through extensive analysis of current nucleotide databases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that the TaDof family can be divided into four clades. Expression analysis of the TaDof family across all major organs using quantitative RT-PCR and searches of the wheat genome array database revealed that the majority of TaDof members were predominately expressed in vegetative organs. A large number of TaDof members were down-regulated by drought and/or were responsive to the light and dark cycle. Further expression analysis revealed that light up-regulated TaDof members were highly correlated in expression with a number of genes that are involved in photosynthesis or sucrose transport. These data suggest that the TaDof family may have an important role in light-mediated gene regulation, including involvement in the photosynthetic process."

The total CFUs in rhizosphere were 1.04 x 10(9)/g soil with 9.0 x 10(8)/g bacteria, 1.37 x 10(8)/g actinomyces and 3.6 x 10(6)/g fungi. The 10 dominant bacteria were isolated from wheat rhizosphere and were grouped into genus Bacillus according to their full length 16S rRNA gene sequences. Although belonging to the same genus, the isolated strains exhibited different sensitivities to oxytetracycline. When a series of the rhizosphere soil was exposed under various concentrations of oxytetracycline, the microbial community structure was highly affected with significant decline of CFUs of bacteria and actinomyces (22.2% and 31.7% at 10 mg/kg antibiotic, respectively). This inhibition was clearly enhanced with the increase exposure dosage of antibiotic and could not be eliminated during 30 d incubation. There was no obvious influence of this treatment on fungi population. Among the four soil enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, acidic phosphatase, dehydrogenase and urease), only alkaline phosphatase was sensitive to oxytetracycline exposure with 41.3% decline of the enzyme activity at 10 mg/kg antibiotic and further decrease of 64.3%-80.8% when the dosage over 30 mg/kg."

The actual sequence of 265 amino acids having a molecular mass of 29931 Da completely defines the primary structure of wheat S4. Homology modeling shows a bi-lobed protein topology arising from folding of the polypeptide into two domains, consistent with the fold topology of prokaryotic S4. The purified protein is stable and folded since it can be reversibly unfolded in guanidinium hydrochloride, and is capable of hydrolyzing cysteine protease-specific peptide-based fluorescence substrates, including Ac-DEVD-AFC (N-acetyl-Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin) and Z-FR-AMC (N-CBZ-Phe-Arg-aminomethylcoumarin)."

Pioneer 26R61 has provided effective resistance to stripe rust for 10 years. To elucidate the genetic basis of the resistance, a mapping population of 178 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed using single-seed descent from a cross between Pioneer 26R61 and the susceptible cultivar AGS 2000. A genetic map with 895 markers covering all 21 chromosomes was used for QTL analysis. One major QTL was detected, explaining up to 56.0% of the mean phenotypic variation, flanked by markers Xbarc124 and Xgwm359, and assigned to the distal 22% of the short arm of wheat chromosome 2A. Evidence showed that it was different from Yr17 derived from Ae. ventricosa, the only formally named Yr gene in 2AS, and the QTL was temporarily designated as YrR61. In addition, a minor QTL, QYr.uga-6AS, probably conditioned high-temperature adult plant resistance. The QTL explained 6-7% of the trait variation. Preliminary test of the flanking markers for YrR61, in two cultivars and two promising breeding lines with Pioneer 26R61 in their pedigree, indicated that YrR61 was present in these cultivars and lines, and these markers could therefore be used in marker-assisted selection."

"21777856","abstracttext","We investigated the compositional and structural differences in sequences derived from different fractions of wheat genomic DNA obtained using methylation filtration and C(0)t fractionation. Comparative analysis of these sequences revealed large compositional and structural variations in terms of GC content, different structural elements including repeat sequences (e.g., transposable elements and simple sequence repeats), protein coding genes, and non-coding RNA genes. A correlation between methylation status [determined on the basis of selective inclusion/exclusion in methylation-filtered (MF) library] of different repeat elements and expression level was observed. The expression levels were determined by comparing MF sequences with expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available in the public domain. Only a limited overlap among MF, high C(0)t (HC), and ESTs was observed, suggesting that these sequences may largely either represent the low-copy non-transcribed sequences or include genes with low expression levels. Thus, these results indicated a need to study MF and HC sequences along with ESTs to fully appreciate complexity of wheat gene space."

However, little work has been reported on the genetic relationships between the S-genome and B-genome chromosomes of polyploid wheat. Here, we report the isolation of a set of disomic substitutions (DS) of S-genome chromosomes for the B-genome chromosomes and their effects on gametophytic and sporophytic development. Ae. speltoides chromosomes were identified by their distinct C-banding and fluorescence in situ hybridization patterns with the Ae. speltoides-derived clone pGc1R-1. Although no large structural differences between S-genome and B-genome chromosomes exist, significant differences in gametophytic compensation were observed for chromosomes 1S, 3S, 5S and 6S. Similarly, chromosomes 1S, 2S, 4S, 5S and 6S affected certain aspects of sporophytic development in relation to spike morphology, fertility and meiotic pairing. The DS5S(5B) had disturbed meiosis with univalents/multivalents and suffered chromosome elimination in the germ tissues leading to haploid spikes in 50% of the plants. The effect of the Ph1 gene on meiosis is well known, and these results provide evidence for the role of Ph1 in the maintenance of polyploid genome integrity. These and other data are discussed in relation to the structural and functional differentiation of S- and B-genome chromosomes and the practical utility of the stocks in wheat improvement."

"22030277","abstracttext","The wheat curl mite (WCM), Aceria tosichella Keifer, is a polyphagous eriophyoid mite and the primary vector of wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) and five other viral pathogens in cereals. Previous research using molecular markers and a series of laboratory experiments found A. tosichella in Australia to consist of two genetically distinct lineages, which have broad overlapping distributions and differ in their ability to transmit WSMV under controlled conditions. This pattern of transmission also appears to be apparent in the field, whereby a strong association between WSMV detection and a single WCM lineage has been detected. In this study, we conduct a population genetic analysis and provide information on the genetic structure of the Australian viruliferous WCM lineage. We assessed genetic differentiation of 16 WCM populations using nine microsatellite markers. Strong evidence for extensive gene flow and low genetic structuring throughout the Australian wheatbelt was evident, with an exception for Western Australian and far north Queensland populations that appear to be genetically isolated. The data also indicate genetic patterns consistent with an arrhenotokous parthenogenetic mode of reproduction. Implications of these findings are discussed with reference to the management of WCM and associated cereal pathogens in Australia and overseas."

We have thus set out to identify and characterize the subunits of these enzymes in two plant model systems. Expression of the two known Arabidopsis MRP RNA genes in vivo was verified. The first wheat MRP RNA sequences are presented, leading to improved structure models for plant MRP RNAs. A novel mRNA encoding the central RNase P/MRP protein Pop1p was identified in Arabidopsis, suggesting the expression of distinct protein variants from this gene in vivo. Pop1p-specific antibodies precipitate RNase P activity and MRP RNAs from wheat extracts. Our results provide evidence that in plants, Pop1p is associated with MRP RNAs and with the catalytic subunit of RNase P, either separately or in a single large complex."
"22741610","articletitle","The wheat MAP kinase phosphatase 1 confers higher lithium tolerance in yeast."
"22741610","abstracttext","The durum wheat TMKP1 gene encodes a MAP kinase phosphatase. When overexpressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, TMKP1 leads to salt stress tolerance (especially LiCl ), which is dependent on the phosphatase activity of the protein. The TMKP1-associated Li(+) resistance is restricted to a galactose-containing medium. Interestingly, this salt tolerance is abolished in the absence of one member of the yeast type 2C Ser/Thr protein phosphatase family (Ptc1) but not when other members such as Ptc2 or Ptc3 are lacking. Increased Li(+) tolerance is not mediated by regulation of the P-type ATPase Ena1, a major determinant for salt tolerance. In contrast, the effect of TMKP1 depends on Hal3 (a negative regulator of Ppz phosphatases) and on the presence of the high-affinity potassium transporters Trk1/Trk2. Tolerance to Li(+) is also abolished in cells lacking the aldose reductase Gre3, previously shown to be involved in the resistance to this cation. This study provides evidence that the wheat TMKP1 phosphatase is contributing to reduce the exacerbated lithium toxicity in galactose-grown cells, in a way that depends on the presence of the potassium Trk transporters."
"23562726","articletitle","Widespread, abundant, and diverse TE-associated siRNAs in developing wheat grain."
"23562726","abstracttext","Small RNAs related to RNA interference are key molecules in many developmental processes, in which they can both regulate developmental gene expression and maintain the integrity of the genome and epigenome. In plants, short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 24 nt in length are an abundant type of small RNA associated with transposable elements (TEs), other repetitive sequences, and viral defense. One means by which TE-associated siRNAs affect genome integrity is by altering chromatin structure through a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). In this paper, we describe a comparative survey of siRNAs from wheat seedling leaves, seedling roots, young spikelets, and grains at 8 and 15 days after pollination (DAP). We find that the general patterns of siRNA distributions are similar across different TEs and within TEs of the same family regardless of tissue, but the relative abundance of 24-nt siRNAs is highest in developing grains. We also find that TEs that are transcriptionally active in endosperm are associated with the highest siRNA abundance not only in grains, but also in other tissues as well. These results suggest that RdDM is an important feature of developing wheat grain and are consistent with the hypothesis that TE expression in endosperm results in increased TE siRNAs, and that RdDM is a conserved feature of plant seed development."

"23538839","abstracttext","Evaluation of genetic diversity and genetic structure in crops has important implications for plant breeding programs and the conservation of genetic resources. Newly developed single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers are effective in detecting genetic diversity. In the present study, a worldwide durum wheat collection consisting of 150 accessions was used. Genetic diversity and genetic structure were investigated using 946 polymorphic SNP markers covering the whole genome of tetraploid wheat. Genetic structure was greatly impacted by multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, breeding methods reflected by release periods of varieties, and gene flows via human activities. A loss of genetic diversity was observed from landraces and old cultivars to the modern cultivars released during periods of the Early Green Revolution, but an increase in cultivars released during the Post Green Revolution. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of genetic diversity among the 10 mega ecogeographical regions indicated that South America, North America, and Europe possessed the richest genetic variability, while the Middle East showed moderate levels of genetic diversity."
"22608228","articletitle","Phylogenetic analyses and toxigenic profiles of Fusarium equiseti and Fusarium acuminatum isolated from cereals from Southern Europe."
"22608228","abstracttext","Fusarium equiseti and Fusarium acuminatum are toxigenic species that contaminate cereal crops from diverse climatic regions. They are common in Spanish cereals. The information available on their phylogenetics and toxigenic profiles is, however, insufficient to assist risk evaluation. In this work, phylogenetic analyses were performed using partial sequences of the translation elongation factor gene (EF-1α) of F. equiseti and F. acuminatum strains isolated from barley and wheat from Spain and other countries. The Northern and Southern European F. equiseti strains largely separated into two phylogenetically distinct clusters. This suggests the existence of two distinct populations within this species, explaining its presence in these regions of markedly different climate. Production of type A and B trichothecenes by the Spanish strains, examined in wheat cultures using a multitoxin analytical method, indicated that F. equiseti could produce deoxynivalenol and nivalenol and other trichothecenes, at concentrations that might represent a significant risk of toxin contamination for Southern European cereals. F. acuminatum showed low intraspecific genetic variability and 58% of the strains could produce deoxynivalenol at low level. Neither species was found to produce T-2 or HT-2 toxins. The present results provide important phylogenetic and toxigenic information essential for the accurate prediction of toxigenic risk."

"22872451","abstracttext","Diversity array technology (DArT) markers are largely used for mapping, genetic diversity, and association mapping studies. For years, they have been used as anonymous genomic markers, as their sequences were not known. As the sequences of 2,000 wheat DArT clones are now available, this study was designed to analyze these sequences with bioinformatic approaches, and to study the genetic features of a subset of 291 markers positioned on the A and B genomes in three durum wheat genetic maps. A set of 1,757 non-redundant sequences was identified, and used as queries for similarity searches. Analysis of the genetic positions of markers corresponding to nearly identical sequences indicates that redundancy of sequences is one of the factors that explains the clustering of these markers in specific genomic regions. Of a total of 1,124 DArT clones (64 %) that represent putatively expressed sequences, putative functions are proposed for more than 700 of them. Of note, many clones correspond to genes that are related to disease resistance, as characterized by leucine-rich repeat domains, and 40 of these clones are positioned in the three genetic maps presented in this study. Finally, DArT markers have been used to find syntenic regions in the Brachypodium and rice genomes. In conclusion, the analyses herein presented contribute to explain the main features of DArT markers observed in genetic maps, as clustering in short chromosome regions. Moreover, the attribution of putative gene functions for more than 700 sequences makes these markers an optimal tool for collinearity studies or for the identification of candidate genes."

"20879840","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is an important plant-pathogenic fungus and the major cause of cereal head blight. Here, we report the functional analysis of FgStuA, the gene for a transcription factor with homology to key developmental regulators in fungi. The deletion mutant was greatly reduced in pathogenicity on wheat heads and in production of secondary metabolites. Spore production was significantly impaired in ΔFgStuA, which did not develop perithecia and sexual ascospores, and lacked conidiophores and phialides, leading to delayed production of aberrant macroconidia. FgStuAp appears to act as a global regulator that may affect many diverse aspects of the life cycle of F. graminearum. Transcriptome analysis shows that thousands of genes are differentially expressed in the mutant during asexual sporulation and infection of wheat heads and under conditions that induce secondary metabolites, including many that could account for the mutant phenotypes observed. The primary regulatory targets of FgStuAp are likely genes involved in cell-cycle control, and the predicted FgStuAp sequence has an APSES domain, with homology to helix-loop-helix proteins involved in cell-cycle regulation. The Aspergillus StuAp response element (A/TCGCGT/ANA/C) was found highly enriched in the promoter sequences of cell-cycle genes, which was upregulated in the ΔFgStuA deletion mutant."
"21216300","articletitle","The genetic basis for 3-ADON and 15-ADON trichothecene chemotypes in Fusarium."
"21216300","abstracttext","Certain Fusarium species cause head blight of wheat and other small grains worldwide and produce trichothecene mycotoxins. These mycotoxins can induce toxicoses in animals and humans and can contribute to the ability of some fusaria to cause plant disease. Production of the trichothecene 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3-ADON) versus 15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15-ADON) is an important phenotypic difference within and among some Fusarium species. However, until now, the genetic basis for this difference in chemotype has not been identified. Here, we identified consistent DNA sequence differences in the coding region of the trichothecene biosynthetic gene TRI8 in 3-ADON and 15-ADON strains. Functional analyses of the TRI8 enzyme (Tri8) in F. graminearum, the predominant cause of wheat head blight in North America and Europe, revealed that Tri8 from 3-ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of the trichothecene biosynthetic intermediate 3,15-diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 15 to yield 3-ADON, whereas Tri8 from 15-ADON strains catalyzes deacetylation of 3,15-diacetyldeoxynivalenol at carbon 3 to yield 15-ADON. Fusarium strains that produce the trichothecene nivalenol have a Tri8 that functions like that in 15-ADON strains. TRI3, which encodes a trichothecene carbon 15 acetyltransferase, was found to be functional in all three chemotypes. Together, our data indicate that differential activity of Tri8 determines the 3-ADON and 15-ADON chemotypes in Fusarium."

"21356468","abstracttext","The limits for the stability of the microbial association 1 (Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and Candida humilis) and association 2 (Lactobacillus reuteri, Lactobacillus johnsonii and Issatchenkia orientalis) during sourdough fermentation were evaluated by investigating the effects of the ecological factors substrate, refreshment time, temperature, amount of backslopping and competing species in different combinations on their growth. Sourdoughs were fermented in 28 batches under different conditions using the associations and possible competing strains as starters. The dominating microbiota was characterized by bacteriological culture, rRNA gene sequence analysis and RAPD-PCR. Association 1 was found to be competitive in doughs with rye and wheat flour at temperatures between 20 and 30 °C, refreshment times of 12 and 24 h, amounts of backslopping dough from 5 to 20% and against all competing lactic acid bacteria and yeasts. The processing parameters for the competitiveness of the association 2 were temperatures of 35-40 °C, refreshment times of 12-24 h and the substrates rye bran, wheat and rye flour, but not in every case. Issatchenkia orientalis could only grow when enough oxygen was available. Its cell counts fell rapidly under the limit of detection when using high amounts of doughs (small ratio of surface to volume) and refreshment times of 12 h. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that the two associations were remarkably stable under most of the investigated process conditions."
"21421346","articletitle","Expression of dehydrins in wheat and barley under different temperatures."
"21421346","abstracttext","The review summarizes recent knowledge on the expression of cold-inducible dehydrins with a special attention to Wcs120 and Dhn5 genes in wheat and barley plants under different temperatures. When plants are exposed to cold, dehydrins start accumulating both in freezing-tolerant and freezing-susceptible plants; however, their accumulation correlates with plant acquired frost tolerance (FT). During a long-term cold acclimation (CA), dehydrin accumulation is significantly affected by Vrn1/Fr1 locus and the expression of the major vernalization gene VRN1, respectively. A different dynamics of dehydrin transcripts and proteins during CA is also observed. Transcripts reach their maximum within the first week of CA while proteins gradually accumulate until vernalization. Vernalization is associated with a significant decrease in dehydrin accumulation while the decrease of acquired FT is delayed. Studies carried out on plants grown at moderately cold temperatures (9-20 °C) have shown that both dehydrin transcripts and proteins can be detected even at these temperatures and that plants with different FT levels can be distinguished according to dehydrin accumulation without any exposure to severe cold. In conclusion, the potential use of these results in the breeding programmes aimed at the enhancement of wheat and barley FT is discussed."

"21421375","abstracttext","The characterization of yield trait mutants is important for understanding the regulation of grain yield formation in staple food crops. Meh0239 is a yield trait-related mutant identified from a mutant library of the common wheat cultivar Wangshuibai created by ethylmethyl sulfide (EMS) treatment of dry seeds. To shed some light on the nature of this mutation, it was investigated morphologically, physiologically, anatomically and genetically. The mutant plant showed obvious phenotypic differences in comparison with the wild type, starting at the seedling stage, including reduced plant height, wider and shorter leaves, shortened spikes, spikelets and grains and a more compact spikelet distribution. Also, seeds produced in the mutant germinated more slowly. Meh0239 contained a significantly higher level of abscisic acid (ABA) but lower levels of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and zeatin riboside (ZR) in flag leaves. Cells of all types in the leaf epidermis appeared shorter along the axial direction. The bulliform cells and long cells on the adaxial leaf surface were abnormal in shape. A genetic analysis using two F₂ segregating populations indicated that a single recessive mutation in wheat chromosome 7DS, about 3.1cM distal from Xwmc506, caused these variations. Because of the pleiotropic nature of this gene and its relation with yield trait formation, we named it Yt1 for yield trait related 1."

"21534465","abstracttext","Evolution of M. graminicola wheat field populations from a given French county (Morbihan, 56) between years 2005 and 2006 was investigated for thirty seven strains using molecular fingerprinting by microsatellite markers (ST1A4, ST1E3, ST1E7, and ST1D7), and SSCP analysis study of partial actin and beta-tubulin encoding sequences. In addition, twenty nine strains collected from 3 distinct lesions on a same wheat leaf in 2006 in another French county (Nord, 59) were also investigated for genetic diversity. At the field level, we observed similar gene diversity in the 2005 and in the 2006 populations, with no common clones between the two years. This indicates frequent sexual recombination undergone by the fungus. When considering each marker independently and comparing genetic variability of the two populations, we noticed a decrease in genetic variability of the 2006 strains for three of them (ST1A4, ST1D7 and the partial sequence of actin) and an increase for ST1E3, ST1E7 and the partial sequence of beta-tubulin, revealing the importance of the chosen markers. At the lesion level, 69% of the studied strains were haplotypes with 31% of the clonal population found in 2 lesions out of 3. This suggests that at least parts of the lesions were formed after asexual reproduction and dissemination of pycnidiospores by splashing. We also confirmed the exploitative competition that exists between the strains at the lesion level."

"21536093","abstracttext","The subgroup 4 of R2R3-MYB transcription factors has been proposed as repressors regulating the phenylpropanoid pathway. Here, we report a cDNA encoding a subgroup 4 R2R3-MYB factor from wheat, designated as TaMYB4. A phylogenetic analysis showed that TaMYB4 is in a subclade that is specific to monocot plants. The TaMYB4 gene was highly expressed in stem and root tissues. In vitro binding analysis in yeast cells showed TaMYB4 interacted with OsCAD2 promoter characterized by an AC-II element that has been considered as the MYB-binding site in lignin biosynthetic genes. The overexpression of TaMYB4 in transgenic tobacco led to transcriptional reduction of both cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase (CAD) and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) genes involved in the lignin biosynthesis. Enzymatic assay showed reduction of CAD and CCR activities in the transgenic tobacco plants that substantially decreased the levels of total lignin but increased it's ratio of S/G. In addition, the total flavonoid content was increased in transgenic tobacco leaves, suggesting that the overexpression of TaMYB4 likely led to a redirection of the metabolic flux from the lignin pathway to the flavonoid pathway. These data suggest that TaMYB4 negatively regulates the lignin biosynthesis in wheat."

"22089973","abstracttext","The bread wheat cultivar Shanrong No.3 (SR3) is a salinity tolerant derivative of an asymmetric somatic hybrid between cultivar Jinan 177 (JN177) and tall wheatgrass (Thinopyrum ponticum). To reveal some of the mechanisms underlying its elevated abiotic stress tolerance, both SR3 and JN177 were exposed to iso-osmotic NaCl and PEG stress, and the resulting gene expression was analysed using a customized microarray. Some genes associated with stress response proved to be more highly expressed in SR3 than in JN177 in non-stressed conditions. Its unsaturated fatty acid and flavonoid synthesis ability was also enhanced, and its pentose phosphate metabolism was more active than in JN177. These alterations in part accounted for the observed shift in the homeostasis related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). The specific down-regulation of certain ion transporters after a 0.5 h exposure to 340 mM NaCl demonstrated that Na(+) uptake occurred rapidly, so that the early phase of salinity stress imposes more than simply an osmotic stress. We discussed the possible effect of the introgression of new genetic materials in wheat genome on stress tolerance."

"22132794","abstracttext","The genes for CA1Pase (2-carboxy-D-arabinitol-1-bisphosphate phosphatase) from French bean, wheat, Arabidopsis and tobacco were identified and cloned. The deduced protein sequence included an N-terminal motif identical with the PGM (phosphoglycerate mutase) active site sequence [LIVM]-x-R-H-G-[EQ]-x-x-[WN]. The corresponding gene from wheat coded for an enzyme with the properties published for CA1Pase. The expressed protein lacked PGM activity but rapidly dephosphorylated 2,3-DPG (2,3-diphosphoglycerate) to 2-phosphoglycerate. DTT (dithiothreitol) activation and GSSG inactivation of this enzyme was pH-sensitive, the greatest difference being apparent at pH 8. The presence of the expressed protein during in vitro measurement of Rubisco (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) activity prevented a progressive decline in Rubisco turnover. This was due to the removal of an inhibitory bisphosphate that was present in the RuBP (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate) preparation, and was found to be PDBP (D-glycero-2,3-pentodiulose-1,5-bisphosphate). The substrate specificity of the expressed protein indicates a role for CA1Pase in the removal of 'misfire' products of Rubisco."

"22086333","abstracttext","The Arabidopsis AtMYB80 transcription factor (formerly AtMYB103) regulate genes essential for tapetal and pollen development. One of these genes, coding for an aspartic protease (UNDEAD), may control the timing of tapetal programmed cell death (PCD). In crop plants such as rice and wheat, abiotic stresses lead to abnormal tapetal development resulting in delayed PCD. Manipulation of AtMYB80 function has been used to develop a reversible male sterility system applicable to hybrid crop production. MYB80 homologs were cloned from wheat, rice, canola and cotton. The promoters of the homologs drove temporal and spatial expression patterns of the GUS reporter gene in the tapetum and microspores of Arabidopsis anthers identical to the AtMYB80 promoter. A short region is conserved in all five MYB80 promoters. The MYB80 homolog genes, driven by the AtMYB80 or their respective promoters, rescued the atmyb80 mutant, completely restoring male fertility. The canola MYB80 was fused to the EAR (ERF-associated amphiphilic repression) repressor and canola plants transgenic for the construct exhibited premature tapetal degradation and subsequent pollen abortion. The five MYB80 homologs all shared a 44 amino acid sequence immediately adjacent to the R2R3 domain which appears to be necessary for MYB80 function."

"22248441","abstracttext","Bipolaris sorokiniana, the causal agent of spot blotch of wheat, significantly reduces grain yield worldwide. In order to study pathogenic mechanisms of the fungus, conditions for efficient transformation using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation were investigated. To study different stages of hyphal fusion and pathogenic mechanisms of the fungus, two fluorescence markers viz. the red fluorescent protein (DsRed-Express) and the green fluorescent protein (EGFP1) were constitutively expressed. Southern hybridizations confirmed the presence of T-DNA in all hygromycin B or geneticin resistant transformants, and also showed random and single copy integration. Fluorescence microscopy suggested the high level expression of both DsRed and EGFP fluorescent proteins in spores and mycelia. The results signify that DsRed and EGFP can be used as efficient reporter gene for monitoring B. sorokiniana hyphal fusion as well as colonization in the host tissues. This work will be useful to develop methodologies for understanding the mechanisms of Bipolaris-wheat interaction and functional genomics of B. sorokiniana for various applications including insertional mutagenesis, targeted disruption of specific genes, ectopic complementation of loss-of-function strains and over-expression."

"22997771","abstracttext","A phenol-degrading fungus was isolated from crop soils. Molecular characterization (using internal transcribed spacer, translation elongation factor and beta-tubulin gene sequences) and biochemical characterization allowed to identify the fungal strain as Penicillium chrysogenum Thom ERK1. Phenol degradation was tested at 25 degrees C under resting mycelium conditions at 6, 30, 60, 200, 350 and 400 mg/l of phenol as the only source of carbon and energy. The time required for complete phenol degradation increased at different initial phenol concentrations. Maximum specific degradation rate (0.89978 mg of phenol/day/mg of dry weight) was obtained at 200 mg/l. Biomass yield decreased at initial phenol concentrations above 60 mg/l. Catechol was identified as an intermediate metabolite by HPLC analysis and catechol dioxygenase activity was detected in plate assays, suggesting that phenol metabolism could occur via ortho fission of catechol. Wheat seeds were used as phytotoxicity indicators of phenol degradation products. It was found that these products were not phytotoxic for wheat but highly phytotoxic for phenol. The high specific degradation rates obtained under resting mycelium conditions are considered relevant for practical applications of this fungus in soil decontamination processes."
"23118024","articletitle","Arrested cell proliferation through cysteine protease activity of eukaryotic ribosomal protein S4."
"23118024","abstracttext","S4 is an integral protein of the smaller subunit of cytosolic ribosome. In prokaryotes, it regulates the synthesis of ribosomal proteins by feedback inhibition of the α-operon gene expression, and it facilitates ribosomal RNA synthesis by direct binding to RNA polymerase. However, functional roles of S4 in eukaryotes are poorly understood, although its deficiency in humans is thought to produce Turner syndrome. We report here that wheat S4 is a cysteine protease capable of abrogating total protein synthesis in an actively translating cell-free system of rabbit reticulocytes. The translation-blocked medium, imaged by atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, shows dispersed polysomes, and the disbanded polyribosome elements aggregate to form larger bodies. We also show that human embryonic kidney cells transfected with recombinant wheat S4 are unable to grow and proliferate. The mutant S4 protein, where the putative active site residue Cys 41 is replaced by a phenylalanine, can neither suppress protein synthesis nor arrest cell proliferation, suggesting that the observed phenomenon arises from the cysteine protease attribute of S4. The results also inspire many questions concerning in vivo significance of extraribosomal roles of eukaryotic S4 performed through its protease activity."

"23081982","abstracttext","Members of the core pooids represent the most important crops in temperate zones including wheat, barley, and oats. Their importance as crops is largely due to the grain, particularly the storage capabilities of the endosperm. In this study, a comprehensive survey of grain morphology and endosperm organization in representatives of wild and cultivated species throughout the core pooids was performed. As sister to the core pooid tribes Poeae, Aveneae, Triticeae, and Bromeae within the Pooideae subfamily, Brachypodium provides a taxonomically relevant reference point. Using macroscopic, histological, and molecular analyses distinct patterns of grain tissue organization in these species, focusing on the peripheral and modified aleurone, are described. The results indicate that aleurone organization is correlated with conventional grain quality characters such as grain shape and starch content. In addition to morphological and organizational variation, expression patterns of candidate gene markers underpinning this variation were examined. Features commonly associated with grains are largely defined by analyses on lineages within the Triticeae and knowledge of grain structure may be skewed as a result of the focus on wheat and barley. Specifically, the data suggest that the modified aleurone is largely restricted to species in the Triticeae tribe."

"23671653","abstracttext","Leaf type is an important trait that closely associates with crop yield. WRKY transcription factors exert diverse regulatory effects in plants, but their roles in the determination of leaf type have not been reported so far. In this work, we isolated a WRKY transcription factor gene TaWRKY71-1 from a wheat introgression line SR3, which has larger leaves, superior growth capacity and higher yield than its parent common wheat JN177. TaWRKY71-1 specifically expressed in leaves, and produced more mRNA in SR3 than in JN177. TaWRKY71-1 localized in the nucleus and had no transcriptional activation activity. TaWRKY71-1 overexpression in Arabidopsis resulted in hyponastic rosette leaves, and the hyponastic strength was closely correlative with the transcription level of the transgene. The spongy mesophyll cells at abaxial side of leaves were drastically compacted by TaWRKY71-1 overexpression. In TaWRKY71-1 overexpression Arabidopsis, the expression of IAMT1 that encodes a methyltransferase converting free indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to methyl-IAA ester (MeIAA) to alter auxin homeostatic level was induced, and the induction level was dependent on the abundance of TaWRKY71-1 transcripts. Besides, several TCP genes that had found to be restricted by IAMT1 had lower expression levels as well. Our results suggest that TaWRKY71-1 causes hyponastic leaves through altering auxin homeostatic level by promoting the conversion of IAA to MeIAA."

There were close phylogenetic relationships between all sequences but clustering on the phylogenetic trees was congruent with their provenance, suggesting an origin-dependent population genetic structure. There were low levels of genetic diversity, ranging from 0.00035 ± 0.00019 to 0.01536 ± 0.00043 (CP), and 0.00086 ± 0.00039 to 0.00573 ± 0.00111 (VPg), indicating genetic stability or recent emergence of WYMV in China. The results may suggest that founder effects play a role in shaping the genetic structure of WYMV. Between-population diversity was consistently higher than within-population diversity, suggesting limited gene flow between subpopulations (average FST 0.6241 for the CP and 0.7981 for the VPg). Consistent amino acid substitutions correlated with the provenance of the sequences were observed at nine positions in the CP (but none in the VPg), indicating an advanced stage in population structuring. Strong negative (purifying) selection was implicated on both the CP and VPg but positive selection on a few codons in the CP, indicating an ongoing molecular adaptation."

In this study, we obtained a draft genome of Pf29Arp and subsequent comparative genomic analyses have revealed that this bacterial strain is closely related to strains of the 'P. brassicacearum-like' subgroup including P. brassicacearum ssp. brassicacearum NFM421 and P. fluorescens F113. Despite an overall chromosomal organization similar to these strains, a number of features including antibiotic synthesis gene clusters from secondary metabolism are not found in the Pf29Arp genome. But Pf29Arp possesses different protein secretion systems including type III (T3SS) and type VI (T6SS) secretion systems. Pf29Arp is the first Pseudomonas sp. strain described with four T6SS clusters (cluster I, II, III and IV). In addition, some protein-coding genes involved in the assembly of these secretion systems are basally expressed during Pf29Arp colonization of healthy wheat roots and display different expression patterns on necrotized roots caused by Ggt. These data suggest a role of T3SS and T6SS in the Pf29Arp adaptation to different root environments."

"23922838","abstracttext","Calcineurin B-like protein-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) have been found to be responsive to abiotic stress. However, their precise functions and the related molecular mechanisms in abiotic stress tolerance are not completely understood, especially in wheat. In the present study, TaCIPK29 was identified as a new member of CIPK gene family in wheat. TaCIPK29 transcript increased after NaCl, cold, methyl viologen (MV), abscisic acid (ABA) and ethylene treatments. Over-expression of TaCIPK29 in tobacco resulted in increased salt tolerance, which was demonstrated by higher germination rates, longer root lengths and better growth status of transgenic tobacco plants compared to controls when both were treated with salt stress. Physiological measurements indicated that transgenic tobacco seedlings retained high K(+)/Na(+) ratios and Ca(2+) content by up-regulating some transporter genes expression and also possessed lower H2O2 levels and reduced membrane injury by increasing the expression and activities of catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD) under salt stress. Moreover, transgenic lines conferred tolerance to oxidative stress by increasing the activity and expression of CAT. Finally, TaCIPK29 was located throughout cells and it preferentially interacted with TaCBL2, TaCBL3, NtCBL2, NtCBL3 and NtCAT1. Taken together, our results showed that TaCIPK29 functions as a positive factor under salt stress and is involved in regulating cations and reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis."
"24146090","articletitle","Segregation distortion caused by weak hybrid necrosis in recombinant inbred lines of common wheat."
"24146090","abstracttext","Segregation distortion of molecular markers is closely related to hybrid incompatibility in progeny from intraspecific crosses. Recent reports in higher plants have demonstrated that hybrid sterility results in segregation distortion at the causal gene regions in progeny of intraspecific crosses. Ne1 and Ne2 complementary loci are known to control hybrid necrosis in intraspecific crosses of common wheat cultivars. Here, we examine the effect of a weak necrosis allele Ne1(w) on the segregation ratio of molecular markers in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of common wheat. Some RILs showed accelerated cell death in the leaves at the heading stage due to the epistatic interaction between two quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 5B and 2B. Chromosomal localization of these QTL corresponding to Ne1(w) and Ne2 showed distorted segregation ratios of assigned markers having oppositely biased direction. Although the Ne1(w) and Ne2 interaction had no obvious effect on seed fertility, Ne1(w) reduced completion of grain development under the Ne2-homozygous background. This reduction might be one of causes that induces segregation distortion in the 5B and 2B chromosomal regions of RILs. The present study demonstrated that weak hybrid necrosis has limited phenotypic effects; it causes segregation distortion in progeny from intraspecific crosses."

"23840606","abstracttext","Stripe rust caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst) is a major constraint to wheat production worldwide. The molecular events that underlie Pst pathogenicity are largely unknown. Like all rusts, Pst creates a specialized cellular structure within host cells called the haustorium to obtain nutrients from wheat, and to secrete pathogenicity factors called effector proteins. We purified Pst haustoria and used next-generation sequencing platforms to assemble the haustorial transcriptome as well as the transcriptome of germinated spores. 12,282 transcripts were assembled from 454-pyrosequencing data and used as reference for digital gene expression analysis to compare the germinated uredinospores and haustoria transcriptomes based on Illumina RNAseq data. More than 400 genes encoding secreted proteins which constitute candidate effectors were identified from the haustorial transcriptome, with two thirds of these up-regulated in this tissue compared to germinated spores. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression patterns of 94 effector candidates. The analysis also revealed that spores rely mainly on stored energy reserves for growth and development, while haustoria take up host nutrients for massive energy production for biosynthetic pathways and the ultimate production of spores. Together, these studies substantially increase our knowledge of potential Pst effectors and provide new insights into the pathogenic strategies of this important organism."

"24202753","abstracttext","Chromosome constitutions of three wheat-Agropyron intermedium derivatives were identified by C-banding analysis, in situ hybridization using biotin-labeled genomic Ag. intermedium DNA as a probe and isozyme analysis. Lines W44 and W52 were identified as 7Ai-2(7D) and 7Ai-2(7A) chromosome substitution lines carrying the same chromosome pair of Ag. intermedium. The alien chromosome was found to be homoeologous to group 7 based on C-banding, meiotic pairing and isozyme analyses. Line W49 was identified as a wheat Ag. intermedium chromosome translocation line. The breakpoint of the T2AS · 2AL-7Ai-2L translocation is located in the long arm at a fraction length of 0.62, and the transferred Ag. intermedium segment has a size of about 2.4 μm. Lines W44 and W52 expressed Ag. intermedium genes for resistance to leaf rust, stripe rust and stem rust, but only leaf rust resistance was expressed in W49. The results show that the leaf rust resistance gene(s), designated Lr38, is located in the distal half of the long arm of chromosome 7Ai-2, whereas the genes for resistance to stem rust and stripe rust are located either in the short arm or in the proximal region of the long arm of this chromosome."

The aims of this investigation were to determine both the number of expressed α - Amy - 1 genes and their relative transcript abundance. Sub-cloning and sequencing of expressed high pI α-amylase genes in developing wheat seeds revealed three insertion/deletion patterns in the 3' untranslated region and numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms at the 3' end of α - Amy - 1. The genetic variations defined 36 α - Amy - 1 gene sequences that were expressed on the onset of LMA in doubled haploid progenies (SpM25, SpM52 and SpM127) derived from the cross Spica (LMA)/Maringa (non-LMA). Five isoelectric point groups were predicted based on the translated partial coding sequences. The potential application of quantitative real-time RT-PCR in screening wheat genotypes for LMA is discussed."

"24441510","abstracttext","Fusarium graminearum is the main causal pathogen affecting small-grain cereals, and it produces deoxynivalenol, a kind of mycotoxin, which displays a wide range of toxic effects in human and animals. Bacterial strains isolated from peanut shells were investigated for their activities against F. graminearum by dual-culture plate and tip-culture assays. Among them, twenty strains exhibited potent inhibition to the growth of F. graminearum, and the inhibition rates ranged from 41.41% to 54.55% in dual-culture plate assay and 92.70% to 100% in tip-culture assay. Furthermore, eighteen strains reduced the production of deoxynivalenol by 16.69% to 90.30% in the wheat kernels assay. Finally, the strains with the strongest inhibitory activity were identified by morphological, physiological, biochemical methods and also 16S rDNA and gyrA gene analysis as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. The current study highlights the potential application of antagonistic microorganisms and their metabolites in the prevention of fungal growth and mycotoxin production in wheat kernels. As a biological strategy, it might avoid safety problems and nutrition loss which always caused by physical and chemical strategies."
"24276905","articletitle","Partial purification of plant transcription factors. II. An in vitro transcription system is inefficient."
"24276905","abstracttext","Crude wheat germ nuclear extracts contain many inhibitors of transcription which need to be removed before an active system can be developed. Using ion exchange column chromatography to resolve RNA polymerase II transcription components we can identify at least four fractions required for transcription by their ability to interact with, or substitute for, particular HeLa fractions. Inhibitors can be removed by a second or third chromatographic process applied to each fraction. Two plant fractions can each effectively replace the corresponding fraction in a HeLa transcription system, and the wheat fractions can work together and replace two HeLa fractions. These plant factors chromatograph identically to HeLa factors on ion exchange columns. The third fraction does not fully substitute for the corresponding HeLa fraction, but can complement this HeLa fraction when both are added at half-optimal levels. An in vitro plant system consisting of four plant chromatographic fractions will selectively transcribe a gene, but only at very low efficiency. The apparent block to greater efficiency is in elongation of the RNA past the 20-30n size."

"24312325","abstracttext","The contribution of cell surface proteins to plant pathogenicity of fungi is not well understood. As such, the objective of this study was to investigate the functions and importance of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPI-APs) in the wheat pathogen F. graminearum. GPI-APs are surface proteins that are attached to either the membrane or cell wall. In order to simultaneously disrupt several GPI-APs, a phosphoethanolamine transferase-encoding gene gpi7 was deleted and the resultant mutant characterized in terms of growth, development, and virulence. The Δgpi7 mutants exhibited slower radial growth rates and aberrantly shaped macroconidia. Furthermore, virulence tests and microscopic analyses indicated that Gpi7 is required for ramification of the fungus throughout the rachis of wheat heads. In parallel, bioinformatics tools were utilized to predict and inventory GPI-APs within the proteome of F. graminearum. Two of the genes identified in this screen (FGSG_01588 and FGSG_08844) displayed isolate-specific length variability as observed for other fungal cell wall adhesion genes. Nevertheless, deletion of these genes failed to reveal obvious defects in growth, development, or virulence. This research demonstrates the global importance of GPI-APs to in planta proliferation in F. graminearum, and also highlights the potential of individual GPI-APs as diagnostic markers."
"24329172","articletitle","Substitutions of two amino acids in the nucleotide-binding site domain of a resistance protein enhance the hypersensitive response and enlarge the PM3F resistance spectrum in wheat."
"24329172","abstracttext","Proteins with nucleotide-binding site (NBS) and leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains are major components of the plant immune system. They usually mediate resistance against a subgroup of races of a specific pathogen. For the allelic series of the wheat powdery mildew resistance gene Pm3, alleles with a broad and a narrow resistance spectrum have been described. Here, we show that a broad Pm3 spectrum range correlates with a fast and intense hypersensitive response (HR) in a Nicotiana transient-expression system and this activity can be attributed to two particular amino acids in the ARC2 subdomain of the NBS. The combined substitution of these amino acids in narrow-spectrum PM3 proteins enhances their capacity to induce an HR in Nicotiana benthamiana, and we demonstrate that these substitutions also enlarge the resistance spectrum of the Pm3f allele in wheat. Finally, using Bph14, we show that the region carrying the relevant amino acids also plays a role in the HR regulation of another coiled-coil NBS-LRR resistance protein. These results highlight the importance of an optimized NBS-'molecular switch' for the conversion of initial pathogen perception by the LRR into resistance-protein activation, and we describe a possible approach to extend the effectiveness of resistance genes via minimal targeted modifications in the NBS domain."

"24193488","abstracttext","The inheritance and biochemical properties of gliadins controlled by the group 1 chromosomes of the high-quality bread wheat cultivar Neepawa were studied in the progeny of the cross Neepawa x Costantino by six different electrophoretic procedures. Chromosome 1B of Neepawa contains two gliadin loci, one (Gli-B1) coding for at least six ω- or γ-gliadins, the other (Gli-B3) controlling the synthesis of gliadin N6 only. The map distance between these loci was calculated as 22.1 cM. Amongst the chromosome 1A gliadins, three proteins are encoded at the Gli-A1 locus whereas polypeptides N14-N15-N16 are controlled by a remote locus which recombines with Gli-A1. Six other gliadins are controlled by a gene cluster at Gli-D1 on chromosome 1D. Canadian wheat cultivars sharing the Gli-B1 allele of Neepawa were found to differ in the presence or absence of gliadin N6. The electrophoretic mobilities of proteins N6 and N14-N15-N16 were unaffected by the addition of a reducing agent during two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamid-gel electrophoresis, suggesting the absence of intra-chain disulphide bonds in their structure."

Somatic hybrids were selected on the basis of resistance to both methotrexate and kanamycin. Evidence for nuclear hybridization was obtained for 21 hybrids by restriction-fragment-length-polymorphism (RFLP) analysis using a heterologous wheat nuclear ribosomal-DNA (rDNA) probe and by analysis of glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) isoenzymes. Chloroplasts segregated non-randomly as 20 of the somatic hybrids possessedN. rustica chloroplasts and only one hadN. tabacum chloroplasts. Patterns of mitochondrial inheritance were examined by hybridization of a heterologous wheat cytochrome oxidase subunit II (coxII) gene with genomic DNA of the somatic hybrids. Four somatic hybrids with hybridization patterns similar toN. rustica and 17 with hybridization patterns consistent with mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) rearrangement or recombination were obtained. None of the somatic hybrids had patterns ofcoxll hybridization identical withN. tabacum. Male-fertility levels in the hybrids ranged from undetectable to 87% and only nine hybrids produced a limited amount of viable seed. There was no apparent correlation between the patterns of organelle inheritance in the somatic hybrids and the relative degree of fertility."

"24193708","abstracttext","The Mr 15000 protein associated with water-washed wheat starch granules from soft wheats was shown to be heterogeneous: it could be divided into a fraction containing one or moreα-amylase inhibitor subunits and a fraction largely composed of a previously uncharacterised polypeptide(s) referred to as the ""grainsoftness protein"" (GSP). The major N-terminal sequence and sequences of peptides derived from protease digests of GSP are reported. An antiserum specific for GSP was used to show that GSP accumulated in both hard and soft wheat grains, but the GSP in soft grains associated more strongly with starch granules than the GSP in hard grains. A positive correlation between grain softness and accumulation of GSP in the seed was demonstrated for a range of cultivars. This differs from the qualitative relationship, based on the isolated starch fraction, between GSP and grain softness that has already been reported. Analysis of wholemeal extracts with the antiserum demonstrated that the accumulation of GSP in the seed was dependent on the short arm of chromosome 5D, which also encodes theHa locus. In addition, examination of near-isogenic lines differing in hardness indicated that the gene(s) controlling GSP was (were) linked with theHa locus. The findings indicate that GSP may be the product of theHa locus and thus be the major factor that determines the milling characteristics of bread wheats."

"24265778","abstracttext","Reduction in crop yield and quality due to various abiotic stresses is a worldwide phenomenon. In the present investigation, a heat shock factor (HSF) gene expressing preferentially in developing seed tissues of wheat grown under high temperatures was cloned. This newly identified heat shock factor possesses the characteristic domains of class A type plant HSFs and shows high similarity to rice OsHsfA2d, hence named as TaHsfA2d. The transcription factor activity of TaHsfA2d was confirmed through transactivation assay in yeast. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaHsfA2d not only possess higher tolerance towards high temperature but also showed considerable tolerance to salinity and drought stresses, they also showed higher yield and biomass accumulation under constant heat stress conditions. Analysis of putative target genes of AtHSFA2 through quantitative RT-PCR showed higher and constitutive expression of several abiotic stress responsive genes in transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing TaHsfA2d. Under stress conditions, TaHsfA2d can also functionally complement the T-DNA insertion mutants of AtHsfA2, although partially. These observations suggest that TaHsfA2d may be useful in molecular breeding of crop plants, especially wheat, to improve yield under abiotic stress conditions."

"24253819","abstracttext","Restriction enzyme digestion of the ribosomal RNA genes of the nucleolar organisers of wheat has revealed fragment length polymorphisms for the nucleolar organiser on chromosome 1B and the nucleolar organiser on 6B. Variation between genotypes for these regions has also been demonstrated. This variation has been exploited to determine the recombination frequency between the physically defined nucleolar organiser on 1B (designatedNor1) and other markers; two loci,Glu-B1 andGli-B1 which code for endosperm storage proteins andRf3, a locus restoring fertility to male sterility conditioned byT. timopheevi cytoplasm.Gli-B1 andRf3 were located on the short-arm satellite but recombine with the nucleolar organiser giving a gene order ofNor1 - Rf3 - Gli-B1. Glu-B1 is located on the long arm of 1B but shows relatively little recombination withNor1, which is, in physical distance, distal on the short arm. This illustrates the discrepancy between map distance and physical distance on wheat chromosomes due to the distal localisation of chiasmata. The recombination betweenNor1 andRf3 indicates that, contrary to previous suggestions, fertility restoration is not a property of the nucleolar organiser but of a separate locus."

"25103024","abstracttext","The PstICL1 gene, which encodes isocitrate lyase, a key enzyme in the glyoxylate cycle, was cloned and characterized in the biotrophic wheat pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Expression analyses of PstICL1 exhibited high levels of transcripts in ungerminated urediniospores, which showed low isocitrate lyase enzyme activity. In planta, PstICL1 expression was continuously down-regulated upon germination. During the later stages of the infection of wheat, the level of PstICL1 expression was extremely low. The function of PstICL1 was identified via mutant complementation. The expression of PstICL1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae can complement the defects of the △ICL mutant. Using 3-nitropropionate, we observed that inactivation of isocitrate lyase greatly reduced the germination rate of urediniospores, indicating that PstICL1 plays a key role during Pst germination. Furthermore, analysis of lipid bodies revealed that lipid components continuously enter the germ tube from the urediniospore cell during germ tube elongation. Moreover, during this period, the lipid contents continuously decreased, and the total carbohydrates markedly increased, demonstrating that the lipids are being converted into carbohydrates. These results suggest that PstICL1 is required for Pst germination."

"26341536","abstracttext","Proteins of the resistance to inhibitors of cholinesterase 8 (Ric8) group act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and play important roles in regulating G-protein signaling in animals. In filamentous fungi, putative Ric8 orthologs have so far been identified in Magnaporthe oryzae, Neurospora crassa, Aspergillus nidulans and Aspergillus fumigatus. Here, we report the functional investigation of a potential RIC8 ortholog (FgRIC8) in the wheat head blight pathogen Fusarium graminearum. Targeted gene deletion mutants of FgRIC8 exhibited a significant reduction in vegetative growth, conidiation, pigment production as well as deoxynivalenol (DON) biosynthesis. Pathogenicity assays using a point-inoculated spikelet approach showed that the mutants were severely impaired in virulence on flowering wheat heads. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that genes encoding F. graminearum Gα (FgGpa1 and FgGpa3), Gβ (FgGpb1) and Gγ (FgGpg1) subunits were significantly down-regulated in Fgric8 mutants. Moreover, we showed that FgRic8 physically interacts with both FgGpa1 and FgGpa3, but not FgGpa2, in yeast two-hybrid assays. The intracellular cAMP levels in Fgric8 mutants were significantly decreased compared to the isogenic wild-type strain. Taken together, our results indicate that FgRic8 plays critical roles in fungal development, secondary metabolism and virulence in F. graminearum and may act as a regulator of G protein alpha subunits."
"25170648","articletitle","Analysis of ATP6 sequence diversity in the Triticum-Aegilops species group reveals the crucial role of rearrangement in mitochondrial genome evolution."
"25170648","abstracttext","Mutation and chromosomal rearrangements are the two main forces of increasing genetic diversity for natural selection to act upon, and ultimately drive the evolutionary process. Although genome evolution is a function of both forces, simultaneously, the ratio of each can be varied among different genomes and genomic regions. It is believed that in plant mitochondrial genome, rearrangements play a more important role than point mutations, but relatively few studies have directly addressed this phenomenon. To address this issue, we isolated and sequenced the ATP6-1 and ATP6-2 genes from 46 different euplasmic and alloplasmic wheat lines. Four different ATP6-1 orthologs were detected, two of them reported for the first time. Expression analysis revealed that all four orthologs are transcriptionally active. Results also indicated that both point mutation and genomic rearrangement are involved in the evolution of ATP6. However, rearrangement is the predominant force that triggers drastic variation. Data also indicated that speciation of domesticated wheat cultivars were simultaneous with the duplication of this gene. These results directly support the notion that rearrangement plays a significant role in driving plant mitochondrial genome evolution."

"25405743","abstracttext","Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are key signaling molecules that are produced in response to various environmental stimuli. Here, we demonstrate that cobalt is able to delay gibberellic acid (GA)-induced programmed cell death (PCD) in wheat aleurone layers. A similar response was observed when samples were pretreated with carbon monoxide (CO) or bilirubin (BR), two end-products of HO catalysis. We further observed that increased HO-1 expression played a role in the cobalt-induced alleviation of PCD. The application of HO-1-specific inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin-IX (ZnPPIX), substantially prevented the increases of HO-1 activity and the alleviation of PCD triggered by cobalt. The stimulation of HO-1 expression, and alleviation of PCD might be caused by the initial H2O2 production induced by cobalt. qRT-PCR and enzymatic assays revealed that cobalt-induced gene expression and the corresponding activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX), three enzymes that metabolize reactive oxygen species, were consistent with the H2O2 accumulation during GA treatment. These cobalt responses were differentially blocked by co-treatment with ZnPPIX. We therefore suggest that HO-1 functions in the cobalt-triggered alleviation of PCD in wheat aleurone layers, which is also dependent on the enhancement of the activities of antioxidant enzymes."
"25407954","articletitle","Characterization of protein kinase PsSRPKL, a novel pathogenicity factor in the wheat stripe rust fungus."
"25407954","abstracttext","As in other eukaryotes, protein kinases (PKs) are generally evolutionarily conserved and play major regulatory roles in plant pathogenic fungi. Many PKs have been proven to be important for pathogenesis in model fungal plant pathogens, but little is currently known about their roles in the pathogenesis of cereal rust fungi, devastating pathogens in agriculture worldwide. Here, we report on an in planta highly induced PK gene PsSRPKL from the wheat stripe rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), one of the most important cereal rust fungi. PsSRPKL belongs to a group of PKs that are evolutionarily specific to cereal rust fungi. It shows a high level of intraspecies polymorphism in the kinase domains and directed green fluorescent protein chimers to plant nuclei. Overexpression of PsSRPKL in fission yeast induces aberrant cell morphology and a decreased resistance to environmental stresses. Most importantly, PsSRPKL is proven to be an important pathogenicity factor responsible for fungal growth and responses to environmental stresses, therefore contributing significantly to Pst virulence in wheat. We hypothesize that cereal rust fungi have developed specific PKs as pathogenicity factors for adaptation to their host species during evolution. Thus, our findings provide significant insights into pathogenicity and virulence evolution in cereal rust fungi."

"26035952","abstracttext","In this study, the ARF genes were cloned, sequenced and located on the chromosomes. The gene expression of various stress conditions were analyzed through RT-PCR. Two important features of ARF in wheat were found: (1) High sequences homology among species in mammalian and plant and (2) Four exons and three introns were conserved in Poaceae. In this study the coding genes of ADP-ribosylation Factors (ARF) were characterized and they were located on chromosomes 3AL and 2DL in common wheat and its diploid progenitors. Forty-seven candidate SNPs in ARF were detected which were located in exons (17 SNPs) and introns (30 SNPs), respectively. As expected, most of the SNPs (66.34%) in ARF were transitions and the rest (33.66%) were transversions. The expression difference of ARF under various environmental stresses (low-temperature, Abscisic Acid (ABA), Polyethylene Glycol (PEG), NaCl, stripe rust), in two stages (seedling and maturity) and in different tissues (root, stem, flag leaf and immature embryo) of 15 days post-flowering were investigated. The results revealed that the expression levels of ARF were affected by environmental stresses. PEG stress induced the highest level of ARF expression, followed by the stripe rust and ABA stresses."
"26869262","articletitle","A wheat superoxide dismutase gene TaSOD2 enhances salt resistance through modulating redox homeostasis by promoting NADPH oxidase activity."
"26869262","abstracttext","Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is believed to enhance abiotic stress resistance by converting superoxide radical (O2 (-)) to H2O2 to lower ROS level and maintain redox homeostasis. ROS level is controlled via biphasic machinery of ROS production and scavenging. However, whether the role of SOD in abiotic stress resistance is achieved through influencing the biophasic machinery is not well documented. Here, we identified a wheat copper-zinc (Cu/Zn) SOD gene, TaSOD2, who was responsive to NaCl and H2O2. TaSOD2 overexpression in wheat and Arabidopsis elevated SOD activities, and enhanced the resistance to salt and oxidative stress. TaSOD2 overexpression reduced H2O2 level but accelerated O2 (-) accumulation. Further, it improved the activities of H2O2 metabolic enzymes, elevated the activity of O2 (-) producer NADPH oxidase (NOX), and promoted the transcription of NOX encoding genes. The inhibition of NOX activity and the mutation of NOX encoding genes both abolished the salt resistance of TaSOD2 overexpression lines. These data indicate that Cu/Zn SOD enhances salt resistance, which is accomplished through modulating redox homeostasis via promoting NOX activity."

In this study, we report the cloning, characterization, and expression patterns of WAG-1 in the pistillody mutant HTS-1 and its sib-line CSTP. The cDNA of WAG-1 was found to be 765 bp in length, which was equal to the length of its open reading frame, encoding 254 amino acids. The location of WAG-1 revealed that it has three homologous genes from the short arm of chromosome 1A, 1B, and 1D. Their genomic sequences were determined to be 5864, 6454, and 6447 bp long, respectively, and possessed seven exons and six introns. Young spikes from HTS-1 contained higher levels of WAG-1 transcript than did those from CSTP, and the transcript levels in the young spikes (7-10 mm in length) of HTS-1 increased 3.3-fold relative to those of the CSTP line. The transcript level in the pistil and pistil-like stamens of HTS-1 was over 2-fold higher than that in the stamens of CSTP, and expression in the pistil-like stamens of HTS-1 was slightly higher than that in its pistils. These data provide a basis for future research into the function of WAG-1, and offer further insight into the molecular mechanism of the pistillody mutation in common wheat."

"26507269","abstracttext","C-hordein in barley and ω-gliadins in wheat are members of the prolamins protein families. Prolamins are the major component of cereal storage proteins and composed of non-essential amino acids (AA) such as proline and glutamine therefore have low nutritional value.

The composition of the prolamin fraction of the barley parental line cv. Golden Promise was resolved using SDS-PAGE electrophoresis, the protein band were excised and the proteins identified by quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Subsequent SDS-PAGE separation and analysis of the prolamin fraction of the transgenic lines revealed a reduction in the amounts of C-hordeins and increases in the content of other hordein family members. Analysis of the AA composition of the transgenic lines showed that the level of essential amino acids increased with a concomitant reduction in proline and glutamine. Both the barley C-hordein and wheat ω-gliadin genes proved successful for RNAi-gene mediated suppression of barley C-hordein level. All transgenic lines that exhibited a reduction for C-hordein showed off-target effects: the lines exhibited increased level of B/γ-hordein while D-hordein level was reduced. Furthermore, the multicopy insertions correlated negatively with silencing."

"26475195","abstracttext","Combining physiological, molecular and biochemical approaches, this study investigated the transcriptional coordination and abscisic acid (ABA) mediated regulation of genes involved in sucrose import and its conversion to starch during grain filling in wheat. Sucrose import appears to be mediated by seed localized TaSUT1, mainly TaSUT1D, while sucrose cleavage by TaSuSy2. Temporal overlapping of the transcriptional activation of AGPL1 and AGPS1a that encode AGPase with that of the above genes suggests their significance in the synthesis of ADP-glucose; TaAGPL1A and TaAGPL1D contributing the majority of AGPL1 transcripts. ABA induced repressions of TaSUT1, TaSuSy2, TaAGPL1 and TaAGPS1a imply that ABA negatively regulates sucrose import into the endosperm and its subsequent metabolism to ADP-glucose, the substrate for starch synthesis. The formations of amyloses and amylopectin from ADP-glucose appear to be mediated by specific members of GBSS, and SS, SBE and DBE gene families, and the ABA-induced transcriptional change in most of these genes implies that ABA regulates amylose and amylopectin synthesis. The findings provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the coordination and ABA mediated regulation of sucrose transport into the developing endosperm and its subsequent metabolism to starch during grain filling in wheat."

Notably, expression of several key regulators such as the HS transcription factors HSFA2 and HSFA3, Multiprotein Bridging Factor 1c (MBF1c) and UV-HYPERSENSITIVE 6 (UVH6) is down-regulated in the gcn5 mutant under HS compared with the wild-type. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays indicated that GCN5 protein is enriched at the promoter regions of HSFA3 and UVH6 genes, but not in HSFA2 and MBF1c, and that GCN5 facilitates H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation, which are associated with HSFA3 and UVH6 activation under HS. Moreover, constitutive expression of UVH6 in the gcn5 mutant partially restores heat tolerance. Taken together, our data indicate that GCN5 plays a key role in the preservation of thermotolerance via versatile regulation in Arabidopsis. In addition, expression of the wheat TaGCN5 gene re-establishes heat tolerance in Arabidopsis gcn5 mutant plants, suggesting that GCN5-mediated thermotolerance may be conserved between Arabidopsis and wheat."

"26519405","abstracttext","PGSB (Plant Genome and Systems Biology; formerly MIPS-Munich Institute for Protein Sequences) has been involved in developing, implementing and maintaining plant genome databases for more than a decade. Genome databases and analysis resources have focused on individual genomes and aim to provide flexible and maintainable datasets for model plant genomes as a backbone against which experimental data, e.g., from high-throughput functional genomics, can be organized and analyzed. In addition, genomes from both model and crop plants form a scaffold for comparative genomics, assisted by specialized tools such as the CrowsNest viewer to explore conserved gene order (synteny) between related species on macro- and micro-levels.The genomes of many economically important Triticeae plants such as wheat, barley, and rye present a great challenge for sequence assembly and bioinformatic analysis due to their enormous complexity and large genome size. Novel concepts and strategies have been developed to deal with these difficulties and have been applied to the genomes of wheat, barley, rye, and other cereals. This includes the GenomeZipper concept, reference-guided exome assembly, and ""chromosome genomics"" based on flow cytometry sorted chromosomes."

"26453232","abstracttext","Shortawn foxtail (Alopecurus aequalis) is a troublesome grass weed infesting winter wheat and oilseed rape productions in China. Fenoxaprop-p-ethyl and mesosulfuron-methyl failed to control shortawn foxtail of AHSX-1 population collected from a wheat field in Shou County, Anhui province. Molecular analyses revealed that Asp2078Gly mutation of ACCase and Trp574Leu mutation of AHAS were present in plants of the AHSX-1 population. The homozygous plants were isolated and cultured until seed maturity. Whole-plant herbicide bioassays were conducted in the greenhouse using the purified seeds of F1 generation. Dose-response experiments showed that the AHSX-1 population has evolved a very high level resistance to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (RI = 275) and mesosulfuron-methyl (RI = 788). To determine the sensitivity to other herbicides, assays were conducted at the single recommended rate of each herbicide. Based on the results, the AHSX-1 population was considered to be highly resistant to clodinafop-propargyl, pyroxsulam and flucarbazone-sodium, moderately or highly resistant to quizalofop-p-ethyl, clethodim, sethoxydim and pinoxaden, and susceptible to isoproturon and chlorotoluron. This is the first report of Asp2078Gly mutation in shortawn foxtail and the two robust dCAPS markers designed could quickly detect Asp2078 and Trp574 mutations in ACCase and AHAS gene of shortawn foxtail, respectively."

"27099966","abstracttext","We previously reported that mutations occurred in the gene myosin5 were responsible for resistance to the fungicide phenamacril in Fusarium graminearum. Here, we determined whether there is a functional link between phenamacril resistance and the myosin proteins FaMyo2B and Famyo2 in Fusarium asiaticum, which is the major causal agent of Fusarium head blight in China. We found that FaMyo2B acts jointly with FaSmy1 to affect resistance to phenamacril in F. asiaticum. We also found that FaMyo2B disruption mutant and Famyo2 deletion mutant were defective in hyphal branching, conidiation, and sexual reproduction. ΔFamyo2 also had an enhanced sensitivity to cell wall damaging agents and an abnormal distribution of septa and nuclei. In addition, the FaMyo2B and Famyo2 mutants had reduced pathogenicity on wheat coleoptiles and flowering wheat heads. Taken together, these results reveal that FaMyo2B and Famyo2 are required for several F. asiaticum developmental processes and activities, which help us better understand the resistance mechanism and find the most effective approach to control FHB."

"27100790","abstracttext","Gene flow from crop to wild relatives is a common phenomenon which can lead to reduced adaptation of the wild relatives to natural ecosystems and/or increased adaptation to agrosystems (weediness). With global warming, wild relative distributions will likely change, thus modifying the width and/or location of co-occurrence zones where crop-wild hybridization events could occur (sympatry). This study investigates current and 2050 projected changes in sympatry levels between cultivated wheat and six of the most common Aegilops species in Europe. Projections were generated using MaxEnt on presence-only data, bioclimatic variables, and considering two migration hypotheses and two 2050 climate scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Overall, a general decline in suitable climatic conditions for Aegilops species outside the European zone and a parallel increase in Europe were predicted. If no migration could occur, the decline was predicted to be more acute outside than within the European zone. The potential sympatry level in Europe by 2050 was predicted to increase at a higher rate than species richness, and most expansions were predicted to occur in three countries, which are currently among the top four wheat producers in Europe: Russia, France and Ukraine. The results are also discussed with regard to conservation issues of these crop wild relatives."

An effective low-temperature silage technology system was constructed and two frigostable Lactobacillus (L.) strains isolated from alpine pastures were selected and proved to be available for wheat straw silage at 5°C. The strains QZ227 and QZ887 were both identified as L. plantarum according to the phenotype, 16S rRNA, and RecA gene analysis. QZ227, QZ887 and a commercial inoculant FG1 consisting of L. plantarum were effective for improving the fermentation quality of wheat straws silage at 5°C for 30 days as indicated by the higher content of lactic acid and for 60 days by lower pH values, while the control with sterile water instead conferred reduced benefits. Additionally, silages fermented at low temperature proved to be acceptable for feeding livestock after being placed in a simulated environmental temperature of 20°C for 14 days to detect its edibility during the early spring when the temperature begins to rise. Both QZ227 and QZ887 showed potential applications of silage making in frigid areas and were effective inoculants in a low-temperature silage technology system."

"28959050","abstracttext","Somatic embryogenesis receptor kinases (SERKs) belong to a small gene family of receptor-like kinases involved in signal transduction. A total of 54 genes were shortlisted from the wheat genome survey sequence of which 5 were classified as SERKs and 49 were identified as SERK-like (SERLs). Tissue- specific expression of TaSERKs at major developmental stages of wheat corroborates their indispensable role during somatic and zygotic embryogenesis. TaSERK transcripts show inherent differences in their hormonal sensitivities, i.e. TaSERK2 and TaSERK3 elicits auxin- specific responses while TaSERK1, 4 and 5 were more specific towards BR-mediated regulation. The ectopic expression of TaSERK1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 in Arabidopsis led to enhanced plant height, larger silique size and increased seed yield. Zygotic embryogenesis specific genes showed a differential pattern in TaSERK Arabidopsis transgenics specifically in the silique tissues. Elongated hypocotyls and enhanced root growth were observed in the overexpression transgenic lines of all five TaSERKs. The inhibitory action of auxin and brassinosteroid in all the TaSERK transgenic lines indicates their role in regulating root development. The results obtained imply redundant functions of TaSERKs in maintaining plant growth and development."

"28711829","abstracttext","A 30year field experiment with a wheat-soybean cropping system were performed to compare the long-term anthropogenic influence on soil ARGs. Compared with chemical fertilization, the occurrence of 38 ARGs and the abundance of seven ARGs (tetL, tetB(P), tetO, tetW, sul1, ermB, and ermF) were significantly increased by long term exposure of pig manure. However, application of wheat straw and cow manure not substantially affected the abundance of ARGs except cow manure increased the abundance of tetM and tetW to a detectable level. Relative abundance of Firmicutes, Gammaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes and ARGs observed in the soil were significantly correlated. Integrase gene I1 (intI1) is commonly linked to genes conferring resistance to antibiotics, it was significantly increased in pig manure treated soils and showed a high positive correlation with the abundance of ARGs which were significantly affected by pig manure. Concentrations of Cu, Zn and Pb were also increased in manure treated soil and positive correlated with the relative abundance of intI1 and most of the ARGs. These results indicated that long-term animal manure application to soils has polluted the soil, especially for pig manure, and it should be scrutinized as part of future stewardship programs."

"28455375","abstracttext","Wheat domestication from wild species involved mutations in the Q gene. The q allele (wild wheats) is associated with elongated spikes and hulled grains, whereas the mutant Q allele (domesticated wheats) confers subcompact spikes and free-threshing grains. Previous studies showed that Q encodes an AP2-like transcription factor, but the causal polymorphism of the domestication traits remained unclear. Here, we show that the interaction between microRNA172 (miR172) and the Q allele is reduced by a single nucleotide polymorphism in the miRNA binding site. Inhibition of miR172 activity by a miRNA target mimic resulted in compact spikes and transition from glumes to florets in apical spikelets. By contrast, overexpression of miR172 was sufficient to induce elongated spikes and non-free-threshing grains, similar to those observed in three Q loss-of-function mutations. These lines showed transitions from florets to glumes in the basal spikelets. These localized homeotic changes were associated with opposing miR172/ Q gradients along the spike. We propose that the selection of a nucleotide change at the miR172 binding site of Q contributed to subcompact spikes and free-threshing grains during wheat domestication."

"28481096","abstracttext","As the world population increases, strategies for sustainable agriculture are needed to fulfill the global need for plants for food and other commercial products. Nanoparticle formulations are likely to be part of the developing strategies. CuO and ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) offer potential as fertilizers, as they provide bioavailable essential metals, and as pesticides, because of dose-dependent toxicity. Effects of these metal oxide NPs on rhizosphere functions are the focus of this review. These NPs at doses of ≥10 mg metal/kg change the production of key metabolites involved in plant protection in a root-associated microbe, Pseudomonas chlororaphis O6. Altered synthesis occurs in the microbe for phenazines, which function in plant resistance to pathogens, the pyoverdine-like siderophore that enhances Fe bioavailability in the rhizosphere and indole-3-acetic acid affecting plant growth. In wheat seedlings, reprogramming of root morphology involves increases in root hair proliferation (CuO NPs) and lateral root formation (ZnO NPs). Systemic changes in wheat shoot gene expression point to altered regulation for metal stress resilience as well as the potential for enhanced survival under stress commonly encountered in the field. These responses to the NPs cross kingdoms involving the bacteria, fungi, and plants in the rhizosphere. Our challenge is to learn how to understand the value of these potential changes and successfully formulate the NPs for optimal activity in the rhizosphere of crop plants. These formulations may be integrated into developing practices to ensure the sustainability of crop production."

However, the exact relationship between GS and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) remain unclear. We have selected and compared two wheat cultivars, YM49 and XN509, which were identified as the N-efficient and N-inefficient genotypes, respectively. In this study, agronomical, morphological, physiological and biochemical approaches were performed. The results showed that TaGS1 was high expressed post-anthesis, and TaGS2 was highly expressed pre-anthesis in N-efficient genotype compared to N-inefficient genotype. GS1 and GS2 isozymes were also separated by native-PAGE and found that the spatial and temporal distribution of GS isozymes, their expression of gene and protein subunits in source-sink-flow organs during development periods triggered the pool strength and influenced the N flow. According to the physiological role of GS isozymes, we illustrated four metabolic regulation points, by which acting collaboratively in different organs, accelerating the transport of nutrients to the grain. It suggested that the regulation of GS isozymes may promote flow strength and enhance NUE by a complex C-N metabolic mechanism. The relative activity or amount of GS1 and GS2 isozymes could be a potential marker to predict and select wheat genotypes with enhanced NUE."

In order to search for candidate genes associated to the response to water deficit, we analyzed the gene expression profiles, under severe drought stress, in roots and leaves of the cultivar MGS1 Aliança, a well-adapted cultivar to the Cerrado. A set of 4,422 candidate genes was found in roots and leaves. The number of down-regulated transcripts in roots was higher than the up-regulated transcripts, while the opposite occurred in leaves. The number of common transcripts between the two tissues was 1,249, while 2,124 were specific to roots and 1,049 specific to leaves. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a 0.78 correlation with the expression data. The candidate genes were distributed across all chromosomes and component genomes, but a greater number was mapped on the B genome, particularly on chromosomes 3B, 5B and 2B. When considering both tissues, 116 different pathways were induced. One common pathway, among the top three activated pathways in both tissues, was starch and sucrose metabolism. These results pave the way for future marker development and selection of important genes and are useful for understanding the metabolic pathways involved in wheat drought response."

"27696417","abstracttext","The fungus Zymoseptoria tritici is a strictly apoplastic, host-specific pathogen of wheat leaves and causal agent of septoria tritici blotch (STB) disease. All other plants are considered nonhosts, but the mechanism of nonhost resistance (NHR) to Z. tritici has not been addressed previously. We sought to develop Nicotiana benthamiana as a system to study NHR against Z. tritici. Fluorescence microscopy and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions were used to establish the interaction between Z. tritici and N. benthamiana. Agrobacterium-mediated transient expression was used to screen putative Z. tritici effector genes for recognition in N. benthamiana, and virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) was employed to determine the role of two receptor-like kinases (RLKs), NbBAK1 and NbSOBIR1, in Z. tritici effector recognition. Numerous Z. tritici putative effectors (14 of 63 tested) induced cell death or chlorosis in N. benthamiana. For most, phenotypes were light-dependent and required effector secretion to the leaf apoplastic space. Moreover, effector-induced host cell death was dependent on NbBAK1 and NbSOBIR1. Our results indicate widespread recognition of apoplastic effectors from a wheat-infecting fungal pathogen in a taxonomically distant nonhost plant species presumably by cell surface immune receptors. This suggests that apoplastic recognition of multiple nonadapted pathogen effectors may contribute to NHR."

In this study, a population of 191 F 9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between two winter cultivars Yumai 8679 and Jing 411. A dense genetic linkage map with 10,816 markers was constructed by incorporating single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker information. Five spike morphological traits and plant height were evaluated under nine environments for the RILs and parental lines, and the number of detected environmentally stable QTLs were 18 and three, respectively. The 1RS/1BL (rye) translocation increased both spike length and spikelet number with constant spikelet compactness. The QPht.cau-2D.1 was identical to gene Rht8 , which decreased spike length without modifying spikelet number. Notably, four novel QTLs locating on chromosomes 1AS ( QSc.cau-1A.1 ), 2DS ( QSc.cau-2D.1 ), and 7BS ( QSl.cau-7B.1 and QSl.cau-7B.2 ) were firstly identified in this study, which provide further insights into the genetic factors that shaped the spike morphology in wheat. Moreover, SNP markers tightly linked to previously reported QTLs will eventually facilitate future studies including their positional cloning or marker-assisted selection."

However, application of biotechnologies has been limited in rye breeding since it is one of the most recalcitrant species in tissue culture. A simple and fast regeneration system from leaf-base segment explant of rye was developed in this study. Basal media, carbohydrate source, combination of plant growth regulators and the leaf segment locations were evaluated for callus and shoot formation. The highest callus formation (10.39%) and shoot formation (4.53%) were achieved from first basal segments 3-4 days old seedlings.

Genes differentially expressed after and before vernalization were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using false discovery rate (FDR) ≤ 0.001 and |log2 (fold change)|>1 as cutoffs. The Jing841-specific DEGs were screened and subjected to functional annotation using gene ontology (GO) database. Vernalization responsive genes among the specific genes were selected for validation by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and the expression change over the time was investigated for the top 11 genes with the most significant expression differences. A total of 138,062 unigenes were obtained. Overall, 636 DEGs were identified as vernalization responsive genes including some known genes such as VRN-1 and COR14a, and some unknown contigs. The qRT-PCR validated changes in the expression of 18 DEGs that were detected by RNA-seq. Among them, 11 genes displayed four different types of expression patterns over time during the 30-day-long vernalization treatment.

Pre-treatment with putrescine induced the unique expression of various general stress-related genes. Although there were obvious differences between the effects of putrescine and polyethylene glycol treatments, there was also a remarkable overlap between the effects of putrescine and osmotic stress responses in wheat plants, suggesting that putrescine has already induced acclimation processes under control conditions. The fatty acid composition in certain lipid fractions and the antioxidant enzyme activities have also been specifically changed under osmotic stress conditions or after treatment with putrescine."

"29393562","abstracttext","In many eukaryotes, transcription factor MCM1 gene plays crucial roles in regulating mating processes and pathogenesis by interacting with other co-factors. However, little is known about the role of MCM1 in rust fungi. Here, we identified two MCM1 orthologs, PstMCM1-1 and PstMCM1-2, in the stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). Sequence analysis indicated that both PstMCM1-1 and PstMCM1-2 contain conserved MADS domains and that PstMCM1-1 belongs to a group of SRF-like proteins that are evolutionarily specific to rust fungi. Yeast two-hybrid assays indicated that PstMCM1-1 interacts with transcription factors PstSTE12 and PstbE1. PstMCM1-1 was found to be highly induced during early infection stages in wheat and during pycniospore formation on the alternate host barberry (Berberis shensiana). PstMCM1-1 could complement the lethal phenotype and mating defects in a mcm1 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In addition, it partially complemented the defects in appressorium formation and plant infection in a Magnaporthe oryzae Momcm1 mutant. Knock down of PstMCM1-1 resulted in a significant reduction of hyphal extension and haustorium formation and the virulence of Pst on wheat. Our results suggest that PstMCM1-1 plays important roles in the regulation of mating and pathogenesis of Pst most likely by interacting with co-factors."

The SGP-D1 null type was identified in three accessions (Xiaoqingmang, Pushanbamai, and P119). An 18-bp deletion and 9-bp variation were found at the junction region of the 7th intron and 8th exon, leading to deletion of the intron-exon junction recognition site AG when aligned the 8261-bp DNA sequence of TaSSIIa-D in Pushanbamai with that of Chinese Spring. Four cDNA types with mis-spliced isoforms were subsequently detected through amplification of TaSSIIa-D cDNAs. Among these, nine type II cDNAs with a 16-bp deletion in the 8th exon were detected, indicating that the major transcriptional pattern of TaSSIIa in Pushanbamai is type II. In the type IV cDNA, a 97-bp sequence remains undeleted in the end of the 5th exon. The amylose content in Pushanbamai was significantly higher than that in all control lines under field conditions, which suggested that deletion of SGP-D1 has an efficient impact on amylose content. As the TaSSIIa gene plays an important role in regulating the content of amylose, it is anticipated that these natural variants of TaSSIIa-D will provide useful resources for quality improvement in wheat."

Despite its economic importance, little knowledge about the molecular components of fungal pathogenesis is known. In this study, first time the genome sequence of T. indica has been deciphered for unraveling the effectors' functions of molecular pathogenesis of Karnal bunt disease. The T. indica genome was sequenced employing hybrid approach of PacBio Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) and Illumina HiSEQ 2000 sequencing platforms. The genome was assembled into 10,957 contigs (N50 contig length 3 kb) with total size of 26.7 Mb and GC content of 53.99%. The number of predicted putative genes were 11,535, which were annotated with Gene Ontology databases. Functional annotation of Karnal bunt pathogen genome and classification of identified effectors into protein families revealed interesting functions related to pathogenesis. Search for effectors' genes using pathogen host interaction database identified 135 genes. The T. indica genome sequence and putative genes involved in molecular pathogenesis would further help in devising novel and effective disease management strategies including development of resistant wheat genotypes, novel biomarkers for pathogen detection and new targets for fungicide development."

The disruption of neuropeptide signalling leading to attenuation in nematode behaviour and thereby perturbed infection, offers an attractive alternative to control nematodes. In this direction, the present study was aimed at mining of putative FMRFamide-like peptides (FLPs) from the transcriptomic dataset of M. graminicola followed by characterization of those FLPs via sequencing of PCR products, qRT-PCR and Southern hybridization analysis. We have characterized nine flp genes (flp-1, flp-3, flp-6, flp-7, flp-11, flp-12, flp-14, flp-16 and flp-18) and a partial neuropeptide receptor gene (flp-18 GPCR) from M. graminicola in the present study. In addition, in situ localization revealed the expression of flp-1 and flp-7 in neurons posterior to the circumpharyngeal nerve ring of M. graminicola. In vitro silencing of nine flp genes and flp-18 GPCR in M. graminicola J2 and their subsequent infection in rice and wheat roots demonstrated the reduced penetration ability of FLP silenced worms which underscores the potential of the FLPergic system as a broad-spectrum target to manage the root-knot nematode problem in rice-wheat cropping system."

A genome-wide analysis revealed that pathotype 46S 119 might be highly evolved among the three pathotypes in terms of year of detection and prevalence. SNP analysis revealed that ~47% of the gene sets are affected by nonsynonymous mutations. The extracellular secreted (ES) proteins presumably are well conserved among the three pathotypes, and perhaps purifying selection has an important role in differentiating pathotype 46S 119 from pathotypes K and 31. In the present study, we decoded the genomes of three pathotypes, with 81% of the total annotated genes being successfully assigned functional roles. Besides the identification of secretory genes, genes essential for pathogen-host interactions shall prove this study as a huge genomic resource for the management of this disease using host resistance."

"29527215","abstracttext","Highly conserved mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades regulate numerous plant processes, including hormonal responses, stress, and innate immunity. In this research, TaMAPK4 was predicted to be a target of tae-miR164. We verified the binding and suppression of TaMAPK4 by co-expression in Nicotiana benthamiana . Moreover, we found TaMAPK4 was localized in the cytoplasm and nucleus using transient expression analyses. TaMAPK4 transcripts increased following salicylic acid (SA) treatment and when host plants were infected with an avirulent race of the stripe-rust pathogen. Silencing of TaMAPK4 by virus-induced gene silencing permitted increased colonization by the avirulent pathogen race. Detailed histological results showed increased Puccinia striiformis ( Pst ) hyphal length, hyphal branches, and infection uredinial size compared to the non-silenced control. SA accumulation and the transcript levels of TaPR1, TaPR2 , and TaPR5 were significantly down-regulated in TaMAPK4 knockdown plants. Overall, these results suggest that TaMAPK4 plays an important role in signaling during the wheat- Pst interaction. These results present new insights into MAPK signaling in wheat defense to rust pathogen."

In summer 2016, a B. tectroum accession (R) that survived imazamox at the field-use rate (44 g ha -1 ) in an imidazolinone-tolerant (IMI-tolerant or Clearfield™) winter wheat field was collected from a wheat field in Carter County, MT, USA. The aim of this study was to determine the resistance profile of the B. tectroum R accession to imazamox and other ALS inhibitors, and investigate the mechanism of resistance to imazamox."
"28734097","abstracttext_results","The R B. tectorum accession had a high-level resistance (110.1-fold) to imazamox (IMI) and low to moderate-levels cross-resistance to pyroxsulam (TP) (4.6-fold) and propoxycarbazone (SCT) (13.9-fold). The R accession was susceptible to sulfosulfuron (SU) and quizalofop and clethodim (ACCase inhibitors), paraquat (PS I inhibitor), glyphosate (EPSPS inhibitor) and glufosinate (GS inhibitor). Sequence analysis of the ALS gene revealed a single, target-site Ser653Asn mutation in R plants. Pretreatment of malathion followed by imazamox at 44 or 88 g ha -1 did not reverse the resistance phenotype."

"29024189","abstracttext","Intron-specific DNA polymorphism is present among plant β-tubulin gene family members and is considered to be one of the molecular markers based on the difference of tubulin introns length assayed both separately (TBP: 1st intron) or in combination (h-TBP: 1st and 2nd introns). These two approaches are possibly useful for wheat breeding programs, since TBP and h-TBP help to differentiate between the accessions of Aegilops biuncialis Vis., a wild relative of wheat. PCR-derived polymorphic fragments were resolved by PAGE electrophoresis. The length of amplicons varied significantly (395-3900 bp for TBP and 466-3440 bp for h-TBP), while the numbers of polymorphic bands were 21 for TBP and 23 for h-TBP, respectively. PIC mean value was circa 0.3. Dendrograms constructed on the basis of the Nei and Li coefficient with the high bootstrap support reveal a similar order of hierarchy for the samples analyzed using both methods. Thus, both techniques uncover DNA polymorphism level sufficiently high to distinguish different accessions of Ae. biuncialis Vis."

"29931405","abstracttext","Intensive farming practices that implement deep and frequent tillage, high input inorganic fertilization, cultivation with non-host species, and pesticide use are widely reported to be detrimental for arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), which are one of the most important plant biofertilizers. The effect of the reduction of agricultural input on AMF community dynamics following conversion from conventional non-mycorrhizal to lower input mycorrhizal crop cultivation has not yet been fully elucidated. We investigated the effect of the reduction of agricultural input, rotation, and season on AMF communities in winter wheat field soil after conversion from long-term (more than 20 years) non-mycorrhizal (sugar beet) crop cultivation. We described AMF communities from bulk soil samples by specifically targeting the 18S ribosomal gene using a combination of AMF specific primers and 454 pyrosequencing. No effect was found after 3 years' reduction of agricultural input, and only marginal effects were due to rotation with specific crops preceding winter wheat. Instead, season and year of sampling had the most appreciable influence on the AMF community. We suggest that, after conversion from long-term non-mycorrhizal to mycorrhizal crop cultivation, AMF diversity is low if compared to similar agroecosystems. Seasonal and successional dynamics play an important role as determinants of community structure."

"30862122","abstracttext","Atlantic salmon ( Salmo salar ) is a carnivorous fish species whose productive performance tends to be suboptimal when fed low-cost carbohydrate rich meals. It is of interest to study the dynamics of gut microbiota communities in salmonids fed high carbohydrate diets since gut microbes are referred to as key players that influence the metabolism and physiology of the host. A study was conducted to determine the effect of feeding a high carbohydrate diet to Atlantic salmon in gut microbiota communities. A medium carbohydrate (15% wheat starch)/medium protein (MC/MP) diet or a high carbohydrate (30% wheat starch)/low protein (HC/LP) diet was fed to triplicate tanks (28 fish each) during four weeks. We conducted an in-depth characterization of the distal intestine digesta microbiota using high-throughput sequencing of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Firmicutes , Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria were the major phyla determined in either experimental group. Phylum Planctomycetes , class Planctomycetia , order Planctomycetales and genus Lactococcus were significantly more abundant in fish fed the HC/LP diet compared with fish fed the MC/MP diet. Our study suggests feeding a carbohydrate rich meal to salmon exerts a low impact on the structure of gut microbial communities, affecting mostly low-abundance bacteria capable of metabolizing anaerobically carbohydrates as a major energy-yielding substrate."

"32247890","abstracttext","The Fusarium mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) is typically controlled by fungicides. Here, we report DON detoxification using enzymes from the highly active Devosia strain D6-9 which degraded DON at 2.5 μg/min/10 8 cells. Strain D6-9 catabolized DON to 3-keto-DON and 3-epi-DON, completely removing DON in wheat. Genome analysis of three Devosia strains (D6-9, D17, and D13584), with strain D6-9 transcriptomes, identified three genes responsible for DON epimerization. One gene encodes a quinone-dependent DON dehydrogenase QDDH which oxidized DON into 3-keto-DON. Two genes encode the NADPH-dependent aldo/keto reductases AKR13B2 and AKR6D1 that convert 3-keto-DON into 3-epi-DON. Recombinant proteins expressed in Escherichia coli efficiently degraded DON in wheat grains. Molecular docking and site-directed mutagenesis revealed that residues S497, E499, and E535 function in QDDH's DON-oxidizing activity. These results advance potential microbial and enzymatic elimination of DON in agricultural samples and lend insight into the underlying mechanisms and molecular evolution of DON detoxification."

"32316652","abstracttext","Metabolomics is an effective biotechnological tool that can be used to attain comprehensive information on metabolites. In this study, the profiles of metabolites produced by wheat seedlings in response to drought stress were investigated using an untargeted approach with ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS) to determine various physiological processes related to drought tolerance from the cross between drought-tolerant genotype (HX10) and drought-sensitive genotype (YN211). The current study results showed that under drought stress, HX10 exhibited higher growth indices than YN211. After drought stress treatment, a series of phenolics accumulated higher in HX10 than in YN211, whereas the amount of thymine, a pyrimidine, is almost 13 folds of that in YN211. These metabolites, as well as high levels of different amino acids, alkaloids, organic acids, and flavonoids in the drought treated HX10 could help to explain its strong drought-tolerant capacity. The current study explored the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the drought response of wheat seedling; these metabolome data could also be used for potential QTL or GWAS studies to identify locus (loci) or gene(s) associated with these metabolic traits for the crop improvement."

"32676062","abstracttext","All organisms must secure essential trace elements (e.g., Cu) for survival and reproduction. However, excess trace element accumulation in cells is highly toxic. The maintenance of copper (Cu) homeostasis has been extensively studied in mammals, bacteria, and yeast but not in plant pathogens. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of copper tolerance in Fusarium graminearum , the important wheat head scab fungus. RNA-seq revealed induced expression of the P-type ATPase transporter FgCrpA and metallothionein (MT) FgCrdA after excess Cu treatment. Deletion of FgCrpA but not FgCrdA resulted in reduced tolerance to Cu toxicity. The ""Cu fist"" transcription factor FgAceA was involved in Cu detoxification through activation of FgCrpA . △FgAceA was more sensitive to copper toxicity than △FgCrpA and overexpression of FgCrpA restored copper tolerance in △FgAceA. FgAceA negatively regulated aurofusarin production and its biosynthetic gene expression. △FgCrpA and △FgAceA were reduced in virulence in flowering wheat heads and synthesized decreased amounts of the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol when challenged with excess Cu. Taken together, these results suggest that mediation of Cu tolerance in F. graminearum mainly relies on the Cu efflux pump and that FgAceA governs Cu detoxification through activation of FgCrpA ."

Here, we investigated the presence of reproductive symbionts and the effect of the geographical location on the bacterial community associated to adult Hessian flies derived from four major wheat producing areas in Morocco. Using specific 16S rDNA PCR assay, Wolbachia infection was observed in 3% of the natural populations and 10% of the laboratory population. High throughput sequencing of V3-V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene revealed that the microbiota of adult Hessian flies was significantly influenced by their native regions. A total of 6 phyla, 10 classes and 79 genera were obtained from all the samples. Confirming the screening results, Wolbachia was identified as well in the natural Hessian flies. Phylogenetic analysis using the sequences obtained in this study indicated that there is one Wolbachia strain belonging to supergroup A. To our knowledge, this is the first report of Wolbachia in Hessian fly populations. The observed low abundance of Wolbachia most likely does not indicate induction of reproductive incompatibility. Yet, this infection may give a new insight into the use of Wolbachia for the fight against Hessian fly populations."

"32523569","abstracttext","Differences in the chemical and physical properties of dietary fibers are increasingly known to exert effects on their fermentation by gut microbiota. Here, we demonstrate that maize bran particle size fractions show metabolic output and microbial community differences similar to those we previously observed for wheat brans. As for wheat brans, maize bran particles varied in starch and protein content and in sugar composition with respect to size. We fermented maize bran particles varying in size in vitro with human fecal microbiota as inocula, measuring their metabolic fate [i.e., short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)] and resulting community structure (via 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing). Metabolically, acetate, propionate and butyrate productions were size-dependent. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that the size-dependent SCFA production was linked to divergent microbial community structures, which exerted effects at fine taxonomic resolution (the genus and species level). These results further suggest that the physical properties of bran particles, such as size, are important variables governing microbial community compositional and metabolic responses."

"32488970","abstracttext","Ferulic acid is a renewable chemical found in lignocellulose from grasses such as wheat straw and sugarcane. Pseudomonas putida is able to liberate and metabolize ferulic acid from plant biomass. Deletion of the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA hydratase-lyase gene (ech) produced a strain of P. putida unable to utilize ferulic and p-coumaric acid, which is able to accumulate ferulic acid and p-coumaric acid from wheat straw or sugar cane bagasse. Further engineering of this strain saw the replacement of ech with the phenolic acid decarboxylase padC, which converts p-coumaric and ferulic acid into 4-vinylphenol and the flavor agent 4-vinylguaiacol, respectively. The engineered strain containing padC is able to generate 4-vinylguaiacol and 4-vinylphenol from media containing lignocellulose or Green Value Protobind lignin as feedstock, and does not require the addition of an exogenous inducer molecule. Biopolymerization of 4-vinylguaiacol and 4-vinylcatechol styrene products is also carried out, using Trametes versicolor laccase, to generate ""biopolystyrene"" materials on small scale."

"30459781","abstracttext","In order to identify genome regions related to pasta-making quality traits, association mapping (AM) was performed in a set of 165 durum wheat landraces from 21 Mediterranean countries. The collection was genotyped using 1149 DArT markers and 872 of them with a known genetic position were used for AM. The collection was grown in north-east Spain during 3 years. Results of ANOVA showed that trait variation for quality traits, except for grain protein content (GPC), was mainly explained by genetic effects. Landraces showed higher GPC than modern cultivars but lower gluten strength (GS). Modern and eastern landraces showed the highest yellow color index (YI). Balkan landraces showed the lowest test weight (TW). A total of 92 marker-trait associations were detected, 20 corresponding to GS, 21 to GPC, 21 to YI and 30 to TW. With the aim of detecting new genomic regions involved in grain quality, the position of the associations was compared with previously mapped QTL by a meta-QTL analysis. A total of 249 QTLs were projected onto the same map used for AM, identifying 45 meta-QTL (MQTL) regions and the remaining 15 QTLs as singletons. The position of known genes involved in grain quality was also included, and gene annotation within the most significant regions detected by AM was carried out using the wheat genome sequence."

"30150658","abstracttext","The exact relationship between polyamine, abscisic acid and proline metabolisms is still poorly understood. In the present study, the effects of putrescine and abscisic acid treatments alone or in combination with polyethylene glycol-induced osmotic stress were investigated in young wheat plants. It was observed that abscisic acid plays a role in the coordinated regulation of the proline and polyamine biosynthetic pathways, which compounds are related to each other through a common precursor. Abscisic acid pre-treatment induced similar alteration of polyamine contents as the osmotic stress, namely increased the putrescine, but decreased the spermidine contents in the leaves. These changes were mainly related to the polyamine cycle, as both the synthesis and peroxisomal oxidation of polyamines have been induced at gene expression level. Although abscisic acid and osmotic stress influenced the proline metabolism differently, the highest proline accumulation was observed in the case of abscisic acid treatments. The proline metabolism was partly regulated independently and not in an antagonistic manner from polyamine synthesis. Results suggest that the connection, which exists between polyamine metabolism and abscisic acid signalling leads to the controlled regulation and maintenance of polyamine and proline levels under osmotic stress conditions in wheat seedlings."

"30734056","abstracttext","The unfounded use of chiral pesticides has caused widespread concern. In this study, the enantioselective effects of S- and racemic (Rac)-metolachlor on the oxidative stress of wheat seedlings was determined based on physiological and gene transcription differences. Growth inhibition increased with increasing concentrations of tested metolachlor, and S-metolachlor had a stronger inhibitory effect than did Rac-metolachlor. Root growth was also significantly inhibited, but no enantioselective effects from the tested concentrations of the metolachlor enantiomers were observed. At a concentration of 5 mg L -1 , the maximal fresh weight inhibition reached 63.7% and 53.8% for S-metolachlor and Rac-metolachlor, respectively. In response to the S-metolachlor treatment, the maximum level of superoxide anions and malondialdehyde (MDA) increased to 1.73 and 2.55 times that in response to the control treatment, both of which were greater than those in response to the Rac-metolachlor treatment. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) also increased in response to the S-metolachlor treatment, but the activity of peroxidase (POD) decreased. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) revealed that, compared with the Rac-metolachlor treatment, the S-metolachlor treatment attenuated the expression of several antioxidant genes. Together, these results demonstrate that S-metolachlor has a greater effect than does Rac-metolachlor on wheat seedlings."

"30889809","abstracttext","Tunisia, being part of the secondary center of diversity for durum wheat, has rich unexploited landraces that are being continuously lost and replaced by high yielding modern cultivars. This study aimed to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of 196 durum wheat lines issued from landraces collected from Tunisia using Diversity Array Technology sequencing (DArTseq) and to understand possible ways of introduction in comparing them to landraces from surrounding countries. A total of 16,148 polymorphic DArTseq markers covering equally the A and B genomes were effective to assess the genetic diversity and to classify the accessions. Cluster analysis and discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) allowed us to distinguish five distinct groups that matched well with the farmer's variety nomenclature. Interestingly, Mahmoudi and Biskri landraces constitute the same gene pool while Jenah Zarzoura constitutes a completely different group. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that the genetic variation was among rather than within the landraces. DAPC analysis of the Tunisian, Mediterranean and West Asian landraces confirmed our previous population structure and showed a genetic similarity between the Tunisian and the North African landraces with the exception of Jenah Zarzoura being the most distant. The genomic characterization of the Tunisian collection will enhance their conservation and sustainable use."

Subsets of 460 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in drought-tolerant genotype and 236 in drought-sensitive genotype were distinguished and functionally annotated with 105 gene ontology (GO) terms and 77 metabolic pathways. Transcriptome profiling of drought-resistant genotype ""L-82"" showed up-regulation of genes mostly involved in Oxidation-reduction process, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, abiotic stress response, transferase activity and heat shock proteins. On the other hand, down-regulated genes mostly involved in signaling, oxidation-reduction process, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, auxin-responsive protein and lipid metabolism. We hypothesized that the drought tolerance in ""L-82"" was a result of avoidance strategies. Up-regulation of genes related to the deeper root system and adequate hydraulic characteristics to allow water uptake under water scarcity confirms our hypothesis. The transcriptomic sequences generated in this study provide information about mechanisms of acclimation to drought in the selected bread wheat landrace, ""L-82"", and will help us to unravel the mechanisms underlying the ability of crops to reproduce and keep its productivity even under drought stress."

"30850728","abstracttext","To gain insights into the roles of cytokinin (CK) and auxin in regulating dormancy during seed maturation in wheat, we examined changes in the levels of CK and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and expression patterns of their metabolism and signaling genes in embryonic and endospermic tissues of dormant and non-dormant genotypes. Seed maturation was associated with a decrease in the levels of isopentenyladenine in both tissues mainly via repression of the CK biosynthetic TaLOG genes. Differential embryonic trans-zeatin content and expression patterns of the CK related genes including TacZOG, TaGLU and TaARR12 between maturing seeds of the two genotypes implicate CK in the control of seed dormancy induction and maintenance. Seed maturation induced a decrease of IAA level in both tissues irrespective of genotype, and this appeared to be mediated by repression of specific IAA biosynthesis, transport and IAA-conjugate hydrolysis genes. The differential embryonic IAA content and expression pattern of the IAA biosynthetic gene TaAO during the early stage of seed maturation between the two genotypes imply the role of IAA in dormancy induction. It appears from our data that the expression of specific auxin signaling genes including TaRUB, TaAXR and TaARF mediate the role of auxin signaling in dormancy induction and maintenance during seed maturation in wheat."

"30796296","abstracttext","Differences in time to heading that remain after photoperiod and vernalisation requirements have been saturated are classified as earliness per se (Eps) effects. It has been commonly assumed that Eps genes are purely constitutive and independent of environment, although the likely effect of temperature on Eps effects in hexaploid wheat has never been tested. We grew four near isogenic lines (NILs) for the Eps gene located in chromosome 1D (Eps-D1) at 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24 °C. In line with expectations we found that lines carrying the Eps-late allele were always later than those with Eps-early alleles. But in addition, we reported for the first time that the magnitude of the effect increased with decreasing temperature: an Eps x temperature interaction in hexaploid wheat. Variation in heading time due to Eps x temperature was associated with an increase in sensitivity to temperature mainly during late reproductive phase. Moreover, we showed that Eps alleles exhibited differences in cardinal (base, optimum, maximum) temperatures and that the expression of ELF3, (the likely candidate for Eps-D1) also interacted with temperature."

"30798881","abstracttext","Fusarium pseudograminearum is an agronomically important fungus, which infects many crop plants, including wheat, where it causes Fusarium crown rot. Like many other fungi, the Fusarium genus produces a wide range of secondary metabolites of which only few have been characterized. Recently a novel gene cluster was discovered in F. pseudograminearum, which encodes production of cytokinin-like metabolites collectively named Fusarium cytokinins. They are structurally similar to plant cytokinins and can activate cytokinin signalling in vitro and in planta. Here, the regulation of Fusarium cytokinin production was analysed in vitro. This revealed that, similar to deoxynivalenol (DON) production in Fusariumgraminearum, cytokinin production can be induced in vitro by specific nitrogen sources in a pH-dependent manner. DON production was also induced in both F. graminearum and F. pseudograminearum in cytokinin-inducing conditions. In addition, microscopic analyses of wheat seedlings infected with a F. pseudograminearum cytokinin reporter strain showed that the fungus specifically induces its cytokinin production in hyphae, which are in close association with the plant, suggestive of a function of Fusarium cytokinins during infection."

"32424224","abstracttext","High-throughput phenotyping (HTP) technologies can produce data on thousands of phenotypes per unit being monitored. These data can be used to breed for economically and environmentally relevant traits (e.g., drought tolerance); however, incorporating high-dimensional phenotypes in genetic analyses and in breeding schemes poses important statistical and computational challenges. To address this problem, we developed regularized selection indices; the methodology integrates techniques commonly used in high-dimensional phenotypic regressions (including penalization and rank-reduction approaches) into the selection index (SI) framework. Using extensive data from CIMMYT's (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center) wheat breeding program we show that regularized SIs derived from hyper-spectral data offer consistently higher accuracy for grain yield than those achieved by standard SIs, and by vegetation indices commonly used to predict agronomic traits. Regularized SIs offer an effective approach to leverage HTP data that is routinely generated in agriculture; the methodology can also be used to conduct genetic studies using high-dimensional phenotypes that are often collected in humans and model organisms including body images and whole-genome gene expression profiles."

"30673516","abstracttext","Since 1984, the 'Chilero' spring wheat line developed by CIMMYT has proven to be highly resistant to leaf rust and stripe rust. Amid efforts to understand the basis of resistance of this line, a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Avocet and Chilero was studied. The parents and RILs were characterized in field trials for leaf rust and stripe rust in three locations in Mexico between 2012 and 2015 and genotyped with DArT-array, DArT-GBS, and SSR markers. A total of 6,168 polymorphic markers were used to construct genetic linkage maps. Inclusive composite interval mapping detected four colocated resistance loci to both rust diseases and two stripe rust resistant loci in the Avocet × Chilero population. Among these, the quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 1BL was identified as a pleotropic adult plant resistance gene Lr46/Yr29, whereas QLr.cim-5DS/QYr.cim-5DS was a newly discovered colocated resistance locus to both rust diseases in Chilero. Additionally, one new stripe rust resistance locus on chromosome 7BL was mapped in the current population. Avocet also contributed two minor colocated resistance QTLs situated on chromosomes 1DL and 4BS. The flanking SNP markers can be converted to breeder friendly Kompetitive Allele Specific PCR (KASP) markers for wheat breeding programs."

CItr 15026 was crossed to susceptible accessions LMPG-6 and Red Bobs, and 180 double haploid (DH) lines and 140 recombinant inbred lines (RIL), respectively, were developed. The 90K wheat iSelect single-nucleotide polymorphism platform was used to genotype the parents and populations. Parents and 180 DH lines were evaluated in the field in Kenya for three seasons. A major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for APR was consistently detected on chromosome arm 6AS. This QTL was further detected in the RIL population screened in Kenya for one season. Parents, F 1 , and the two populations were tested as seedlings against races TRTTF and TTTTF. In addition, the DH population was tested against race QFCSC. Goodness-of-fit tests indicated that the TRTTF resistance in CItr 15026 was controlled by two complementary genes whereas the TTTTF and QFCSC resistance was conditioned by one dominant gene. The TRTTF resistance loci mapped to chromosome arms 6AS and 6DS, whereas the TTTTF and QFCSC resistance locus mapped to the same region on 6DS as the TRTTF resistance.

"30677359","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici, the causal agent of septoria tritici blotch, is an important wheat pathogen responsible for high yield losses worldwide. The assessment of the distribution of both mating type idiomorphs was studied in several wheat-growing areas in North Algeria. Both mating types occurred at all spatial scales tested and showed an equal frequency distribution at the country level, with 53% for Mat1-1 and 47% for Mat1-2. At finer scales, co-occurrence of both mating types was found in 38% of leaves analyzed and 44% of the studied lesions. Additionally, efficacy reduction of strobilurin applications prompted us to study strobilurin resistance conferred by the G143A substitution in the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, which was found for the first time in six strains. The results suggest that the Algerian Z. tritici population undergoes frequent sexual reproduction mirrored by co-occurrence of both mating types, which likely will rapidly increase the fraction of strobilurin-resistant isolates in the Algerian population, as has been shown in all other regions where strobilurin resistance surfaced."
"30480480","articletitle","Convergent Evolution of Effector Protease Recognition by Arabidopsis and Barley."
"30480480","abstracttext","The Pseudomonas syringae cysteine protease AvrPphB activates the Arabidopsis resistance protein RPS5 by cleaving a second host protein, PBS1. AvrPphB induces defense responses in other plant species, but the genes and mechanisms mediating AvrPphB recognition in those species have not been defined. Here, we show that AvrPphB induces defense responses in diverse barley cultivars. We also show that barley contains two PBS1 orthologs, that their products are cleaved by AvrPphB, and that the barley AvrPphB response maps to a single locus containing a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene, which we termed AvrPphB Response 1 ( Pbr1 ). Transient coexpression of PBR1 with wild-type AvrPphB but not with a protease inactive mutant triggered defense responses, indicating that PBR1 detects AvrPphB protease activity. Additionally, PBR1 coimmunoprecipitated with barley and Nicotiana benthamiana PBS1 proteins, suggesting mechanistic similarity to detection by RPS5. Lastly, we determined that wheat cultivars also recognize AvrPphB protease activity and contain two putative Pbr1 orthologs. Phylogenetic analyses showed, however, that Pbr1 is not orthologous to RPS5 . Our results indicate that the ability to recognize AvrPphB evolved convergently and imply that selection to guard PBS1-like proteins occurs across species. Also, these results suggest that PBS1-based decoys may be used to engineer protease effector recognition-based resistance in barley and wheat."

"30321195","abstracttext","Optimising nitrogen fertiliser management in combination with using high nitrogen efficient wheat cultivars is the most effective strategy to maximise productivity in a cost-efficient manner. The present study was designed to investigate the associations between nitrogen utilisation efficiency (NUtE) and the allelic composition of the NAM genes in Australian wheat cultivars. As results, the non-functional NAM-B1 allele was more responsive to the nitrogen levels and increased NUtE significantly, leading to a higher grain yield but reduced grain protein content. Nitrogen application at different developmental stages (mid-tillering, booting, and flowering) did not show significant differences in grain yield and protein content. The NAM-A1 allelic variation is significantly associated with the length of the grain-filling period. While the NAM-A1 allele a was associated with a short to moderate grain-filling phase, the alleles c and d were related to moderate to long grain-filling phase. Thus, selection of appropriate combinations of NAM gene alleles can fine-tune the duration of growth phases affecting sink-source relationships which offers an opportunity to develop high NUtE cultivars for target environments."

"30682274","abstracttext","Leaf rust (Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (P. striiformis f. tritici) affect wheat production worldwide. Brazilian 'Toropi' wheat has demonstrated durable leaf rust resistance in South America since its release in 1965. It was previously found to have up to two adult plant leaf rust resistance genes. The leaf and stripe rust resistance of Toropi were studied by analyzing a doubled-haploid population made by crossing with susceptible 'Thatcher'. Toropi expressed good resistance to leaf rust in Canada, Brazil, and New Zealand. Based on field and greenhouse testing, the leaf rust resistance of Toropi is conferred by two race-nonspecific complementary adult plant genes and a race-specific adult plant gene. The stripe rust resistance of Toropi analyzed in New Zealand and in Canada is based on up to two resistance genes. Toropi should provide an important contribution to rust resistance because it expressed good leaf rust and stripe rust resistance in different parts of the world."

"31872216","abstracttext","This study aimed to gain insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of ethylene in regulating germination and seedling growth in wheat by combining pharmacological, molecular, and metabolomics approaches. Our study showed that ethylene does not affect radicle protrusion but controls post-germination endospermic starch degradation through transcriptional regulation of specific α-amylase and α-glucosidase genes, and this effect is mediated by alteration of endospermic bioactive gibberellin (GA) levels, and GA sensitivity via expression of the GA signaling gene, TaGAMYB. Our data implicated ethylene as a positive regulator of embryo axis and coleoptile growth through transcriptional regulation of specific TaEXPA genes. These effects were associated with modulation of GA levels and sensitivity, through expression of GA metabolism (TaGA20ox1, TaGA3ox2, and TaGA2ox6) and signaling (TaGAMYB) genes, respectively, and/or the abscisic acid (ABA) level and sensitivity, via expression of specific ABA metabolism (TaNCED2 or TaCYP707A1) and signaling (TaABI3) genes, respectively. Ethylene appeared to regulate the expression of TaEXPA3 and thereby root growth through its control of coleoptile ABA metabolism, and root ABA signaling via expression of TaABI3 and TaABI5. These results show that spatiotemporal modulation of ABA/GA balance mediates the role of ethylene in regulating post-germination storage starch degradation and seedling growth in wheat."

"31811154","abstracttext","Illumina-MiSeq next-generation sequencing of ITS 5.8S rRNA gene demonstrated the transgenerational transmission of fungal seed-endophytes (mycobiome) across three consecutive wheat host generations under standard-control and drought conditions in the greenhouse. Drought-stressed plants experienced a positive shift in the seed mycobiome's composition, moderated by the external acquisition of endophytic Penicillium (E+) at the seed level. Untreated (E-) and unstressed plants harbor a maximal fungal diversity of non-equilibrium ecological communities. While fungal composition in drought-stressed E- plants experienced important fluctuation, E+ plants maintained fungal ecological communities in phase equilibrium across generations. E+ plants hosted a relatively higher abundance of Ascomycota in the 2 nd and 3 rd seed generations of wheat, whereas higher abundance of Basidiomycota was detected in 1 st generation seeds. The dynamic response of ecological communities to environmental stress is conducive to E+ plants' active recruitment of endosymbiotic consortia in seeds, benefiting host stress resilience and phenotype. In contrast, E- plants showed an erratic distribution of detected OTUs with an increased occurrence of phytopathogens and diminished plant performance under stress. The present study gives insight into the understanding of the seed-mycobiome composition and dynamics with the potential to improve plant host traits in an adverse environment."

"31708894","abstracttext","Bacterial symbionts are omnipresent in insects, particularly aphids, and often exert important effects on the host ecology; however, examples of symbionts that mediate herbivore-plant interactions remain limited. Here, three clones with identical genetic backgrounds were established: a Hamiltonella defensa -free clone, H. defensa- infected clone and H. defensa -cured clone. H. defensa infection was found to increase the fitness of Sitobion miscanthi by increasing the total number of offspring and decreasing the age of first reproduction. Furthermore, gene expression studies and phytohormone measurement showed that feeding by the Hamiltonella -infected clone suppressed the salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-related defense pathways and SA/JA accumulation in wheat plants relative to feeding by the other two clones. Additionally, after feeding by the Hamiltonella -infected clone, the activity levels of the defense-related enzymes polyphenol oxidase (PPO) and peroxidase (POD) in wheat plants were significantly decreased compared with the levels observed after feeding by the other two clones. Taken together, these data reveal for the first time the potential role of H. defensa of S. miscanthi in mediating the anti-plant defense responses of aphids."

Presently, there is no detailed and systematic analysis of MYC TFs in wheat, rice, and Brachypodium distachyon . In this study, 26 TaMYC, 7 OsMYC, and 7 BdMYC TFs were identified and their features were characterized. Firstly, they contain a JAZ interaction domain (JID) and a putative transcriptional activation domain (TAD) in the bHLH_MYC_N region and a BhlH region in the C-terminal region. In some cases, the bHLH region is followed by a leucine zipper region; secondly, they display tissue-specific expression patterns: wheat MYC genes are mainly expressed in leaves, rice MYC genes are highly expressed in stems, and B. distachyon MYC genes are mainly expressed in inflorescences. In addition, three types of cis -elements, including plant development/growth-related, hormone-related, and abiotic stresses-related were identified in different MYC gene promoters. In combination with the previous studies, these results indicate that MYC TFs mainly function in growth and development, as well as in response to stresses. This study laid a foundation for the further functional elucidation of MYC genes."

"31400779","abstracttext","Capsella bursa-pastoris is a serious broadleaf weed in winter wheat fields in China. It has evolved high levels of resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides and has caused substantial losses of wheat yield in recent years. We monitored the herbicide resistance of Capsella bursa-pastoris collected from 18 regions of Shandong Province in 2009, 2013 and 2017, respectively. Compared with the 2009 populations, the number of populations resistant to florasulam had increased in 2013 and 2017. Resistance to tribenuron-methyl increased in 2013, but decreased in 2017. The 2009 and 2013 populations developed resistance only to tribenuron-methyl, but some 2017 populations developed cross-resistance to imazethapyr and florasulam as well. Mutations in ALS (Pro-197-Thr/Ser/His/Arg/Leu/Gln) were identified in the 2009 and 2013 populations; however, two ALS mutations (Pro197 and/or Trp574) were identified in 2017 plants. Meanwhile, plants containing both point mutations (Pro197 + Trp574) were identified in the 2017 populations. This study demonstrated that target site gene mutations were the main reason for Capsella bursa-pastoris resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Although target-site mutation is the reason for resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides in Capsella bursa-pastoris, the resistance patterns and mutations identified have changed over time."

"31278291","abstracttext","Soil salinization is a major constraint of agriculture in semiarid ecosystems. In this study soil microcosms were applied to evaluate the impact of a lower- and higher-level salinization treatment of a pristine scrubland soil on the abundance of Bacteria, Archaea, and Fungi, and on prokaryotic diversity in bare soil and the rhizosphere of wheat assessed by qPCR and high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Furthermore, the impact of soil straw amendment as a salt-stress alleviation strategy was studied. While the low-level salinity stimulated plant growth, the seedlings did not survive under the higher-level salinity unless the soil was amended with straw. Without the straw amendment, salinization had only minor effects on the microbial community in bare soil. On the other hand, it decreased prokaryotic diversity in the rhizosphere of wheat, but the straw amendment was effective in mitigating this effect. The straw however, was not a significant nutrient source for the rhizosphere microbiota but more likely acted indirectly by ameliorating the salinity stress on the plant. Members of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were abundant among the bacteria that reacted to soil salinization and the straw amendment but showed inconsistent responses indicating the large physiological diversity within these phyla."

"31581317","abstracttext","Seed vigour and early establishment are important factors determining the yield of crops. A wheat nitrate-inducible NAC transcription factor, TaNAC2, plays a critical role in promoting crop growth and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), and now its role in seed vigour is revealed. A TaNAC2 regulated gene was identified that is a NRT2-type nitrate transporter TaNRT2.5 with a key role in seed vigour. Overexpressing TaNAC2-5A increases grain nitrate concentration and seed vigour by directly binding to the promoter of TaNRT2.5-3B and positively regulating its expression. TaNRT2.5 is expressed in developing grain, particularly the embryo and husk. In Xenopus oocyte assays TaNRT2.5 requires a partner protein TaNAR2.1 to give nitrate transport activity, and the transporter locates to the tonoplast in a tobacco leaf transient expression system. Furthermore, in the root TaNRT2.5 and TaNRT2.1 function in post-anthesis acquisition of soil nitrate. Overexpression of TaNRT2.5-3B increases seed vigour, grain nitrate concentration and yield, whereas RNA interference of TaNRT2.5 has the opposite effects. The TaNAC2-NRT2.5 module has a key role in regulating grain nitrate accumulation and seed vigour. Both genes can potentially be used to improve grain yield and NUE in wheat."

"33000483","abstracttext","Ascospores are the primary inoculum in Fusarium graminearum, a causal agent of wheat head blight. In a previous study, FgPAL1 was found to be upregulated in the Fgama1 mutant and important for ascosporogenesis. However, the biological function of this well-conserved gene in filamentous ascomycetes is not clear. In this study, we characterized its functions in growth, differentiation and pathogenesis. The Fgpal1 mutant had severe growth defects and often displayed abnormal hyphal tips. It was defective in infectious growth in rachis tissues and spreading in wheat heads. The Fgpal1 mutant produced conidia with fewer septa and more nuclei per compartment than the wild type. In actively growing hyphal tips, FgPal1-GFP mainly localized to the subapical collar and septa. The FgPal1 and LifeAct partially co-localized at the subapical region in an interdependent manner. The Fgpal1 mutant was normal in meiosis with eight nuclei in developing asci but most asci were aborted. Taken together, our results showed that FgPal1 plays a role in maintaining polarized tip growth and coordination between nuclear division and cytokinesis, and it is also important for infectious growth and developments of ascospores by the free cell formation process."

"32884064","abstracttext","SET domain genes (SDGs) that are involved in histone methylation have been examined in many plant species, but have never been examined in bread wheat; the histone methylation caused due to SDGs is associated with regulation of gene expression at the transcription level. We identified a total of 166 bread wheat TaSDGs, which carry some interesting features including the occurrence of tandem/interspersed duplications, SSRs (simple sequence repeats), transposable elements, lncRNAs and targets for miRNAs along their lengths and transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in the promoter regions. Only 130 TaSDGs encoded proteins with complete SET domain, the remaining 36 proteins had truncated SET domain. The TaSDG encoded proteins were classified into six classes (I-V and VII). In silico expression analysis indicated relatively higher expression (FPKM > 20) of eight of the 130 TaSDGs in different tissues, and downregulation of 30 TaSDGs under heat and drought at the seedling stage. qRT-PCR was also conducted to validate the expression of seven genes at the seedling stage in pairs of contrasting genotypes in response to abiotic stresses (water and heat) and biotic stress (leaf rust). These genes were generally downregulated in response to the three stresses examined."

"33123186","abstracttext","Potassium (K) is essential for regulating plant growth and mediating abiotic stress responses. Elucidating the biological mechanism underlying plant responses to K-deficiency is crucial for breeding new cultivars with improved K uptake and K utilization efficiency. In this study, we evaluated the extent of the genetic variation among 543 wheat accessions differing in K-deficiency tolerance at the seedling and adult plant stages. Two accessions, KN9204 and BN207, were identified as extremely tolerant and sensitive to K-deficiency, respectively. The accessions were exposed to normal and K-deficient conditions, after which their roots underwent ionomic, transcriptomic, and metabolomic analyses. Under K-deficient conditions, KN9204 exhibited stronger root growth and maintained higher K concentrations than BN207. Moreover, 19,440 transcripts and 162 metabolites were differentially abundant in the roots of both accessions according to transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. An integrated analysis of gene expression and metabolite profiles revealed that substantially more genes, including those related to ion homeostasis, cellular reactive oxygen species homeostasis, and the glutamate metabolic pathway, were up-regulated in KN9204 than in BN207 in response to low-K stress. Accordingly, these candidate genes have unique regulatory roles affecting plant K-starvation tolerance. These findings may be useful for further clarifying the molecular changes underlying wheat root adaptations to K deprivation."

"32730288","abstracttext","The soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces tritici (G. tritici) causes the take-all disease on wheat roots. Ambient pH has been shown to be critical in different steps of G. tritici life cycle such as survival in bulk soil, saprophytic growth, and pathogenicity on plants. There are however intra-specific variations and we previously found two types of G. tritici strains that grow preferentially either at acidic pH or at neutral/alkaline pH; gene expression involved in pH-signal transduction pathway and pathogenesis was differentially regulated in two strains representative of these types. To go deeper in the description of the genetic pathways and the understanding of this adaptative mechanism, transcriptome sequencing was achieved on two strains (PG6 and PG38) which displayed opposite growth profiles in two pH conditions (acidic and neutral). PG6, growing better at acidic pH, overexpressed in this condition genes related to cell proliferation. In contrast, PG38, which grew better at neutral pH, overexpressed in this condition genes involved in fatty acids and amino acid metabolisms, and genes potentially related to pathogenesis. This strain also expressed stress resistance mechanisms at both pH, to assert a convenient growth under various ambient pH conditions. These differences in metabolic pathway expression between strains at different pH might buffer the effect of field or soil variation in wheat fields, and explain the success of the pathogen."

"33293512","abstracttext","Grain weight (GW) is one of the component traits of wheat yield. Existing reports have shown that multiple phytohormones are involved in the regulation of GW in different crops. However, the potential role of jasmonic acid (JA) remains unclear. Here, we report that triticale grain weight 1 (tgw1) mutant, with marked reductions in both GW and JA content, is caused by a premature stop mutation in keto-acyl thiolase 2B (KAT-2B) involved in β-oxidation during JA synthesis. KAT-2B overexpression increases GW in wild type and boosts yield. Additionally, KAT-2B compliments the grain defect in tgw1 and rescues the lethal phenotype of the Arabidopsis kat2 mutant in a sucrose-free medium. Despite the suppression of JA synthesis in tgw1 mutant, ABA synthesis is upregulated, which is accompanied by enhanced expression of SAG3 and reduction of chlorophyll content in leaves. Together, these results demonstrate a role of the JA synthetic gene KAT-2B in controlling GW and its potential application value for wheat improvement."

"18379132","abstracttext","Germination of plant embryo is a dynamic phase-changing process that is driven by a rapid increase in mitochondrial respiration. We studied the development of respiratory electron transport pathways and the profiles of their transcript and protein components during this critical period using wheat embryos. Oxygen consumption through both the cytochrome and alternative pathways increased rapidly upon imbibition. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis using specific primers and western blot analysis using specific antibodies suggested that this respiratory burst was supported both by the stored mRNA and protein components and ones synthesized de novo at least in the cytochrome pathway. Dry embryos also contained transcript and protein of alternative oxidase (AOX), but their levels remained constant during the studied period. By contrast, the alternative pathway capacity showed a marked increase when the cytochrome pathway was inhibited by antimycin A and this increase was associated with increased levels of AOX transcript and protein. Our results suggest that mitochondrial biogenesis is accompanied by sequential and differential gene expression and protein accumulation, and that AOX allows the complex I to continue to conserve energy thus to support embryo germination and initial seedling growth in wheat when the cytochrome pathway is restricted."

"18273811","abstracttext","The family Poaceae includes over 10,000 species, among which are the most economically important cereals: maize, sorghum, rice, wheat, rye, barley, and oat. These cereals are very important components of human and animal food. Although divergence of the members of this family occurred about 40 million years ago, comparative genome analyses demonstrated that gene orders among species of this family remain largely conserved, which can be very useful for understanding their roles and evolution. Even with an intricate evolutionary history in which chromosome fragments, losses and duplications have to be considered at the ploidy level, grasses present a genetic model system for comparative genomics. The availability of mapped molecular markers, rice genome sequences and BAC and EST libraries from several grass species, such as rice, wheat, sorghum, and maize, facilitates biology and phylogeny studies of this group. The value of using information from different species in modern plant genetics is unquestionable, especially in the study of traits such as tolerance to aluminum in soils, which affects plant growth and development. Comparative genomic approaches to aluminum tolerance can identify genomic regions and genes responsible for aluminum tolerance in grasses."
"18483719","articletitle","The development of PCR-based markers for the selection of eyespot resistance genes Pch1 and Pch2."
"18483719","abstracttext","Two eyespot resistance genes (Pch1 and Pch2) have been characterised in wheat. The potent resistance gene Pch1, transferred from Aegilops ventricosa, is located on the distal end of the long arm of chromosome 7D (7DL). Pch2 derives from the variety Cappelle Desprez and is located at the distal end of chromosome 7AL. The RFLP marker Xpsr121 and the endopeptidase isozyme allele Ep-D1b, are very closely linked to Pch1, probably due to reduced recombination in the region of the introgressed A. ventricosa segment. Pch2 is less closely linked to these markers but is thought to be closer to Xpsr121 than to Ep-A1b. In the present study simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were integrated into the genetic map of a single chromosome (7D) recombinant (RVPM) population segregating for Pch1. Sequence-tagged-site (STS)-based assays were developed for Xpsp121 and a 7DL wheat EST containing a SSR. SSR markers Xwmc14 and Xbarc97 and the Xpsr121-derived marker co-segregated with Pch1 in the RVPM population. A single chromosome (7A) recombinant population segregating for Pch2 was screened for eyespot resistance and mapped using SSRs.

This study was conducted to develop an RFLP linkage map of the distal portion of wheat chromosome 7AL, and to locate and identify markers closely associated with Pch2 for use in marker-assisted selection. Ten loci in addition to Pch2 were mapped on chromosome 7AL, using segregation data from 102 homozygous chromosome 7A recombinant substitution lines derived from 'Chinese Spring' x 'Chinese Spring' ('Cappelle Desprez' 7A). The Pch2 locus was bracketed by two RFLP markers, one 11.0 cM distal to Xcdo347 and the other 18.8 cM proximal to Xwg380. The position of Pch2 on chromosome 7AL is similar to that of Pch1 on chromosome 7DL, suggesting that these resistance genes are homoeoloci. Although no single marker was closely linked to Pch2, simultaneous selection of the flanking RFLP markers Xcdo347 and Xwg380 could be used for selecting Pch2, since double recombination occurred in only 3% of the recombinant population. The use of the flanking RFLP markers to select for Pch2, in combination with previously identified Pch1-linked markers, would facilitate the development of cultivars carrying two genes for resistance to eyespot."

The F2 and F3 plants from their crosses with each other and with susceptible cultivar Agra Local were tested against a mixture of pathotypes 77-1 and 77-2 (variants of race 77). Disease scores on F1's from resistant/susceptible parent crosses indicated partial dominance of resistance in these wheats. The six cultivars have two adult-plant resistance genes each. Their intercrosses revealed similar resistance gene(s) in CSP44 and Oxley, and CPAN1235 and HP1209. The six wheats appear to carry at least seven diverse leaf-rust resistance genes (temporarily named LrI to LrO) against pathotypes 77-1 + 77-2. Adult-plant resistance is additive and therefore the combinations of partially effective resistance genes identified in this study can provide higher levels of resistance. Because these genes are of hexaploid origin, they can be easily exploited in breeding programs. Furthermore, two or more resistance genes from the six wheat cultivars when combined with Lr34 are likely to impart durable resistance to leaf rust."

"18521121","abstracttext","Seed dormancy is an important factor regulating preharvest sprouting (PHS) but is a complex trait for genetic analysis. We previously identified a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) controlling seed dormancy on the long arm of chromosome 4A (4AL) in common wheat. To transfer the QTL from the dormant lines 'OS21-5' and 'Leader' into the Japanese elite variety 'Haruyokoi', which has an insufficient level of seed dormancy, backcrossing was carried out through marker-assisted selection (MAS) using PCR-based codominant markers. Nineteen BC5F2 plants with homozygous alleles of 'OS21-5' or 'Haruyokoi' were developed and evaluated for seed dormancy under greenhouse conditions. The seeds harvested from plants with 'OS21-5' alleles showed a clearly high level of dormancy compared with seeds from plants with 'Haruyokoi' alleles. Additionally, the dormancy phenotype of BC3F3 seeds harvested from 128 BC3F2 plants with homozygous alleles of 'Leader' or 'Haruyokoi' showed a clear difference between these alleles. The QTL on 4AL confers a major gene, Phs1, which was mapped within a 2.6 cM region. The backcrossed lines developed in this study can be important sources for improving PHS resistance in Japanese wheat and for analyzing the mechanism of seed dormancy. MAS was useful for the development of near-isogenic lines in this complex trait, to facilitate the molecular dissection of genetic factors."

Strains belonging to several species were grouped into 40 different nifH-RFLP-PCR profiles. The genus Paenibacillus was the most prominent group in both the rhizosphere (77.8%) and soil (79%). Paenibacillus borealis was the most frequently identified species, followed by Paenibacillus graminis. The remainder of the isolated bacteria belonged to the genus Bacillus sp. Indolic compound production (indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), indolepyruvic acid (IPyA) and indoleacetamide (IAM)) was detected in 33.6% and 26% of the isolates from the rhizosphere and soil, respectively. Among the 311 isolates, nine were able to solubilize phosphate and 48 were able to produce siderophores. The isolates SBR5, CSR16 and EsR7, identified by the 16S rRNA gene sequence as strains of Paenibacillus sp., were chosen for in vivo experiments in a greenhouse and proved to be very efficient in promoting a significant increase in the shoot and dry matter of wheat plants. Those strains could be useful in formulation of new inoculants, improving the cropping systems into which they can be most profitably applied."

"17218544","abstracttext","Cellular proteins are extensively degraded during leaf senescence, and this correlates with an up-regulation of protease gene expression, particularly cysteine proteases. The objectives of this work were (i) to detect cysteine proteases associated with senescence of wheat leaves under different conditions and (ii) to find out their subcellular location. Activity labelling of cysteine proteases with the biotinylated inhibitor DCG-04 detected five bands at 27, 36, 39, 42, and 46 kDa in leaves of wheat senescing under continuous darkness. In-gel activity assays showed that these proteases are only active in an acid milieu (pH 4), and their activity increased several-fold in senescing leaves. Fractionation experiments showed that the senescence-associated cysteine proteases of 36, 39, 42, and 46 kDa localize to a vacuolar-enriched fraction. The vacuolar cysteine proteases of 36, 39, and 42 kDa increased in activity in attached flag leaves senescing naturally during post-anthesis, and in attached leaves of plants subjected to a period of water deficit. Thus, the activity of these vacuolar cysteine proteases is associated with developmental (post-anthesis) senescence and with senescence induced by stress factors (i.e. protracted darkness or drought). This suggests that vacuoles are involved in senescence-associated cellular degradation, and that different senescence-inducing factors may converge on a single degradation pathway."

"17193708","abstracttext","An in vitro assay system was developed for accurate transcription of the octopine type T-DNA gene in a wheat germ extract. The system consists of the protein fraction extracted from the chromatin of wheat germ, substrates and exogenously added DNA. Specific initiation at the promoter was determined by a combination of primer extension analysis and size analysis of the transcripts synthesized from DNA templates of various molecular sizes. Synthesis of the transcripts was sensitive to alpha-amanitin. With truncated DNA templates containing the intact promoter and the proximal transcribing region of several hundred base pairs of the T-DNA, run-off transcripts of the expected size originating at the authentic promoter were synthesized together with relatively small amounts of prematurely terminated RNA molecules. On fractionation of the chromatin protein extract by DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, the fraction eluted with 0.3 M KCl showed no activity by itself for specific initiation of transcription at the promoter by RNA polymerase II. The activity was however restored by adding the fraction eluted with 0.15 M KCl, and the reconstituted RNA polymerase fraction correctly initiated transcription at the authentic promoter."

"17091263","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is a severe foliar disease for wheat and could cause great yield loss in epidemic years. To explore new powdery mildew resistance genes, two einkorn accessions including TA2033 and M80, both resistant to this disease, were studied for the inheritance of resistance. Each accession possessed a single but different dominant resistance gene that was designated as Mlm2033 and Mlm80, respectively. Marker mapping indicated that they are both linked to Xgwm344 on the long arm of chromosome 7A. To establish their genetic relationship with Pm1 on 7AL, five RFLP markers previously reported to co-segregate with Pm1a were converted to STS markers. Three of them detected polymorphism between the mapping parents and were mapped close to Mlm2033 or Mlm80 or both. Xmag2185, the locus determined by the STS marker derived from PSR680, one of the RFLP markers, was placed less than 2 cM away from them. The allelism test indicated that Mlm2033 and Mlm80 are likely allelic to each other. In addition, through comparative and EST mapping, more markers linked to these two genes were identified. The high density mapping of Mlm2033 and Mlm80 will contribute to map-based cloning of the Pm1 locus. The markers for both genes will also facilitate their transfer to wheat."

"17332011","abstracttext","Although structures of many DNA-binding proteins have been solved, they fall into a limited number of folds. Here, we describe an approach that led to the finding of a novel DNA-binding fold. Based on the behavior of Type II restriction-modification gene complexes as mobile elements, our earlier work identified a restriction enzyme, R.PabI, and its cognate modification enzyme in Pyrococcus abyssi through comparison of closely related genomes. While the modification methyltransferase was easily recognized, R.PabI was predicted to have a novel 3D structure. We expressed cytotoxic R.PabI in a wheat-germ-based cell-free translation system and determined its crystal structure. R.PabI turned out to adopt a novel protein fold. Homodimeric R.PabI has a curved anti-parallel beta-sheet that forms a 'half pipe'. Mutational and in silico DNA-binding analyses have assigned it as the double-strand DNA-binding site. Unlike most restriction enzymes analyzed, R.PabI is able to cleave DNA in the absence of Mg(2+). These results demonstrate the value of genome comparison and the wheat-germ-based system in finding a novel DNA-binding motif in mobile DNases and, in general, a novel protein fold in horizontally transferred genes."

"19529908","abstracttext","Rye is a diploid crop species with many outstanding qualities, and is important as a source of new traits for wheat and triticale improvement. Rye is highly tolerant of aluminum (Al) toxicity, and possesses a complex structure at the Alt4 Al tolerance locus not found at the corresponding locus in wheat. Here we describe a BAC library of rye cv. Blanco, representing a valuable resource for rye molecular genetic studies, and assess the library's suitability for investigating Al tolerance genes. The library provides 6 x genome coverage of the 8.1 Gb rye genome, has an average insert size of 131 kb, and contains only ~2% of empty or organelle-derived clones. Genetic analysis attributed the Al tolerance of Blanco to the Alt4 locus on the short arm of chromosome 7R, and revealed the presence of multiple allelic variants (haplotypes) of the Alt4 locus in the BAC library. BAC clones containing ALMT1 gene clusters from several Alt4 haplotypes were identified, and will provide useful starting points for exploring the basis for the structural variability and functional specialization of ALMT1 genes at this locus."

"19584907","abstracttext","The development of powerful ""omics"" technologies has enabled researchers to identify many genes of interest for which comprehensive functional analyses are highly desirable. However, the production of lines which ectopically express recombinant genes, or those in which endogenous genes are knocked down via stable transformation, remains a major bottleneck for the association between genetics and gene function in monocotyledonous crops. Methods of effective DNA transfer into regenerable cells of immature embryos from cereals by means of Agrobacterium tumefaciens have been modified in a stepwise manner. The effect of particular improvement measures has often not been significantly evident, whereas their combined implementation has resulted in meaningful advances. Here, we provide updated protocols for the Agrobacterium-mediated generation of stably transgenic barley, wheat, triticale and maize. Based upon these methods, several hundred independent transgenic lines have been delivered, with efficiencies of inoculated embryos leading to stably transgenic plants reaching 86% in barley, 10% in wheat, 4% in triticale, and 24% in maize."
"25063863","articletitle","Effect of the hope FT-B1 allele on wheat heading time and yield components."
"25063863","abstracttext","Precise regulation of flowering time is critical for plant reproductive success and, in cereals, to maximize grain yields. Seasonal cues including temperature and day length are integrated to regulate the timing of flowering. In temperate cereals, extended periods of cold (vernalization) release the repression of FLOWERING LOCUS T1 (FT1), which is upregulated in the leaves in response to inductive long-day photoperiods. FT1 is a homolog of rice HD3a, which encodes a protein transported from leaves to the shoot apical meristem to induce flowering. A rare FT-B1 allele from the wheat variety ""Hope"" has been previously shown to be associated with an early flowering phenotype under long-day photoperiods. Here, we demonstrate that the Hope FT-B1 allele accelerates flowering even under short days, and that it is epistatic to the VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1) gene. On average, the introgression of Hope FT-B1 into 6 genetic backgrounds resulted in 2.6 days acceleration of flowering (P<0.0001) and 4.1% increase in spike weight (P=0.0093), although in one variety, it was associated with a decrease in spike weight. These results suggest that the Hope FT-B1 allele could be useful in wheat breeding programs to subtly accelerate floral development and increase adaptation to changing environments."

"25459835","abstracttext","Hydrogen producing bacteria IODB-O3 was isolated from sludge and identified as Clostridium sp. by 16S rDNA gene analysis. In this study, biohydrogen production process was developed using low-cost agro-waste. Maximum H2 was produced at 37°C and pH 8.5. Maximum H2 yield was obtained 2.54±0.2mol-H2/mol-reducing sugar from wheat straw pre-hydrolysate (WSPH) and 2.61±0.1mol-H2/mol-reducing sugar from pre-treated wheat straw enzymatic-hydrolysate (WSEH). The cumulative H2 production (ml/L), 3680±105 and 3270±100, H2 production rate (ml/L/h), 153±5 and 136±5, and specific H2 production (ml/g/h), 511±5 and 681±10 with WSPH and WSEH were obtained, respectively. Biomass pre-treatment via steam-explosion generates ample amount of WSPH which remains unutilized for bioethanol production due to non-availability of efficient C5-fermenting microorganisms. This study shows that Clostridium sp. IODB-O3 is capable of utilizing WSPH efficiently for biohydrogen production. This would lead to reduced economic constrain on the overall cellulosic ethanol process and also establish a sustainable biohydrogen production process."

"32059028","abstracttext","Durum wheat, genetic resource with favorable alleles is considered as natural gene pool for wheat breeding. Kernel size and weight are important factors affecting grain yield in crops. Here, association analysis was performed to dissect the genetic constitution of kernel-related traits in 150 lines collected from 46 countries and regions using a set of EST-derived and genome-wide SNP markers with five consecutive years of data. Total 109 significant associations for eight kernel-related traits were detected under a mix linear model, generating 54 unique SNP markers distributed on 13 of 14 chromosomes. Of which, 19 marker-trait associations were identified in two or more environments, including one stable and pleiotropic SNP BE500291_5_A_37 on chromosome 5A correlated with six kernel traits. Although most of our SNP loci were overlapped with the previously known kernel weight QTLs, several novel loci for kernel traits in durum were reported. Correlation analysis implied that the moderate climatic variables during growth and development of durum are needed for the large grain size and high grain weight. Combined with our previous studies, we found that chromosome 5A might play an important role in durum growth and development."

"32103263","abstracttext","Awns are bristle-like structures formed at the tip of the lemma on the florets of some cereal grasses. Wild-type wheat is awned, but awnletted and awnless variants have been selected and nowadays all forms are cultivated. In this study, we dissected the genetic control underlying variation of this characteristic feature by association mapping in a large panel of 1110 winter wheat cultivars of worldwide origin. We identified the B1 (Tipped 1) locus on chromosome 5A as the major determinant of awnlessness globally. Using a combination of fine-mapping and expression analysis, we identified a putative C2H2 zinc finger protein with an EAR domain, characteristic of transcriptional repressors, as a likely candidate for Tipped 1. This gene was found to be up-regulated in awnless B1 compared with awned b1 plants, indicating that misexpression of this transcriptional regulator may contribute to the reduction of awn length in B1 plants. Taken together, our study provides an entry point towards a better molecular understanding of the evolution of morphological features in cereals through selection and breeding."

"31928684","abstracttext","Wheat grain nitrogen content displays large variations within different pearling fractions of grains because of radial gradients in the protein content. We identified how spatiotemporal mechanisms regulate this. The protein gradients emerged clearly at 19 days after anthesis, with the highest N content in aleurone and seed coat, followed by outer endosperm, whereas the lowest was in middle and inner endosperm. Laser microdissection, qRT-PCR and LC-MS were used to dissect tissue from aleurone, outer endosperm, middle endosperm, inner endosperm and transfer cells, measure gene expression and levels of free and protein-bound amino acids, respectively. The results showed that different FAA transportation pathways worked in parallel during grain filling stage while the grain protein gradient did not follow spatial expression of storage proteins. Additionally, two nitrogen (N) topdressing timings were conducted, either at the emergence of top third leaf (standard timing) or top first leaf (delayed timing), finding that delayed N topdressing enhanced both amino acids supply and protein synthesis capacity. The results provide insight into protein synthesis and amino acid transport pathways in endosperm and suggest targets for the enhancement of specialty pearled wheat with higher quality."
"28659962","articletitle","Molecular Characterization, Gene Evolution, and Expression Analysis of the Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate Aldolase (FBA) Gene Family in Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)."
"28659962","abstracttext","Fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) is a key plant enzyme that is involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and the Calvin cycle. It plays significant roles in biotic and abiotic stress responses, as well as in regulating growth and development processes. In the present paper, 21 genes encoding TaFBA isoenzymes were identified, characterized, and categorized into three groups: class I chloroplast/plastid FBA (CpFBA), class I cytosol FBA (cFBA), and class II chloroplast/plastid FBA . By using a prediction online database and genomic PCR analysis of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines, we have confirmed the chromosomal location of these genes in 12 chromosomes of four homologous groups. Sequence and genomic structure analysis revealed the high identity of the allelic TaFBA genes and the origin of different TaFBA genes. Numerous putative environment stimulus-responsive cis -elements have been identified in 1,500-bp regions of TaFBA gene promoters, of which the most abundant are the light-regulated elements (LREs). Phylogenetic reconstruction using the deduced protein sequence of 245 FBA genes indicated an independent evolutionary pathway for the class I and class II groups. Although, earlier studies have indicated that class II FBA only occurs in prokaryote and fungi, our results have demonstrated that a few class II CpFBAs exist in wheat and other closely related species. Class I TaFBA was predicted to be tetramers and class II to be dimers. Gene expression analysis based on microarray and transcriptome databases suggested the distinct role of TaFBAs in different tissues and developmental stages. The TaFBA 4-9 genes were highly expressed in leaves and might play important roles in wheat development. The differential expression patterns of the TaFBA genes in light/dark and a few abiotic stress conditions were also analyzed. The results suggested that LRE cis-elements of TaFBA gene promoters were not directly related to light responses. Most TaFBA genes had higher expression levels in the roots than in the shoots when under various stresses. Class I cytosol TaFBA genes, particularly TaFBA10/12/18 and TaFBA13/16 , and three class II TaFBA genes are involved in responses to various abiotic stresses. Class I CpFBA genes in wheat are apparently sensitive to different stress conditions."
"29703735","articletitle","The Catabolite Repressor/Activator Cra Is a Bridge Connecting Carbon Metabolism and Host Colonization in the Plant Drought Resistance-Promoting Bacterium Pantoea alhagi LTYR-11Z."
"29703735","abstracttext","Efficient root colonization is a prerequisite for application of plant growth-promoting (PGP) bacteria in improving health and yield of agricultural crops. We have recently identified an endophytic bacterium, Pantoea alhagi LTYR-11Z, with multiple PGP properties that effectively colonizes the root system of wheat and improves its growth and drought tolerance. To identify novel regulatory genes required for wheat colonization, we screened an LTYR-11Z transposon (Tn) insertion library and found cra to be a colonization-related gene. By using transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis, we found that transcriptional levels of an eps operon, the ydiV gene encoding an anti-FlhD 4 C 2 factor, and the yedQ gene encoding an enzyme for synthesis of cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) were significantly downregulated in the Δ cra mutant. Further studies demonstrated that Cra directly binds to the promoters of the eps operon, ydiV , and yedQ and activates their expression, thus inhibiting motility and promoting exopolysaccharide (EPS) production and biofilm formation. Consistent with previous findings that Cra plays a role in transcriptional regulation in response to carbon source availability, the activating effects of Cra were much more pronounced when LTYR-11Z was grown within a gluconeogenic environment than when it was grown within a glycolytic environment. We further demonstrate that the ability of LTYR-11Z to colonize wheat roots is modulated by the availability of carbon sources. Altogether, these results uncover a novel strategy utilized by LTYR-11Z to achieve host colonization in response to carbon nutrition in the environment, in which Cra bridges a connection between carbon metabolism and colonization capacity of LTYR-11Z. IMPORTANCE Rapid and appropriate response to environmental signals is crucial for bacteria to adapt to competitive environments and to establish interactions with their hosts. Efficient colonization and persistence within the host are controlled by various regulatory factors that respond to specific environmental cues. The most common is nutrient availability. In this work, we unraveled the pivotal role of Cra in regulation of colonization ability of Pantoea alhagi LTYR-11Z in response to carbon source availability. Moreover, we identified three novel members of the Cra regulon involved in EPS synthesis, regulation of flagellar biosynthesis, and synthesis of c-di-GMP and propose a working model to explain the Cra-mediated regulatory mechanism that links carbon metabolism to host colonization. This study elucidates the regulatory role of Cra in bacterial attachment and colonization of plants, which raises the possibility of extending our studies to other bacteria associated with plant and human health."

"32554716","abstracttext","Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici , the causal agent of wheat stripe (yellow) rust, is an obligate, biotrophic fungus. It was difficult to study the genetics of the pathogen due to the lack of sexual reproduction. The recent discovery of alternate hosts for P. striiformis f. sp. tritici makes it possible to study inheritance and map genes involved in its interaction with plant hosts. To identify avirulence ( Avr ) genes in P. striiformis f. sp. tritici , we developed a segregating population by selfing isolate 12-368 on barberry ( Berberis vulgaris ) plants under controlled conditions. The dikaryotic sexual population segregated for avirulent/virulent phenotypes on nine Yr single-gene lines. The parental and progeny isolates were whole-genome sequenced at >30× coverage using Illumina HiSeq PE150 technology. A total of 2,637 high-quality markers were discovered by mapping the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) reads to the reference genome of strain 93-210 and used to construct a genetic map, consisting of 41 linkage groups, spanning 7,715.0 centimorgans (cM) and covering 68 Mb of the reference genome. The recombination rate was estimated to be 1.81 ± 2.32 cM/10 kb. Quantitative trait locus analysis mapped six Avr gene loci to the genetic map, including an Avr cluster harboring four Avr genes, AvYr7 , AvYr43 , AvYr44 , and AvYrExp2 Aligning the genetic map to the reference genome identified Avr candidates and narrowed them to a small genomic region (<200 kb). The discovery of the Avr gene cluster is useful for understanding pathogen evolution, and the identification of candidate genes is an important step toward cloning Avr genes for studying molecular mechanisms of pathogen-host interactions. IMPORTANCE Stripe rust is a destructive disease of wheat worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the most effective, easy-to-use, economical, and environmentally friendly strategy for the control of the disease. However, P. striiformis f. sp. tritici can produce new virulent races that may circumvent race-specific resistance. Therefore, understanding the genetic basis of the interactions between wheat genes for resistance and P. striiformis f. sp. tritici genes for avirulence is useful for improving cultivar resistance for more effective control of the disease. This study developed a high-quality map that facilitates genomic and genetic studies of important traits related to pathogen pathogenicity and adaptation to different environments and crop cultivars carrying different resistance genes. The information on avirulence/virulence genes identified in this study can be used for guiding breeding programs to select combinations of genes for developing new cultivars with effective resistance to mitigate this devastating disease."
"32442667","articletitle","Genetic diversity and population structure of Zymoseptoria tritici in Ethiopia as revealed by microsatellite markers."
"32442667","abstracttext","Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by Zymoseptoria tritici (formerly: Mycosphaerella graminicola or Septoria tritici), is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat globally. Understanding genetic diversity of the pathogen has supreme importance in developing best management strategies. However, there is dearth of information on the genetic structure of Z. tritici populations in Ethiopia. Therefore, the present study was targeted to uncover the genetic diversity and population structure of Z. tritici populations from the major wheat-growing areas of Ethiopia. Totally, 182 Z. tritici isolates representing eight populations were analyzed with 14 microsatellite markers. All the microsatellite loci were polymorphic and highly informative, and hence useful genetic tools to depict the genetic diversity and population structure of the pathogen. A wide range of diversity indices including number of observed alleles, effective number of alleles, Shannon's diversity index, number of private alleles, Nei's gene diversity and percentage of polymorphic loci (PPL) were computed to determine genetic variation within populations. A high within-populations genetic diversity was confirmed with gene diversity index and PPL values ranging from 0.34 - 0.58 and 79-100% with overall mean of 0.45 and 94%, respectively. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed a moderate genetic differentiation where 92% of the total genetic variation resides within populations, leaving only 8% among populations. Cluster (UPGMA), PCoA and STRUCTURE analyses did not group the populations into sharply genetically distinct clusters according to their geographical origins, likely due to high gene flow (Nm = 5.66) and reproductive biology of the pathogen. All individual samples shared alleles from two subgroups (K = 2) evidencing high potential of genetic admixture. In conclusion, the microsatellite markers used in the present study were highly informative and thus, helped to dissect the genetic structures of Z. tritici populations in Ethiopia. Among the studied populations, those of East Shewa, Arsi, South West Shewa and Bale showed a high genetic diversity, and hence these areas can be considered as hot spots for investigations planned on the pathogen and host-pathogen interactions. Therefore, the present study not only enriches missing information in Ethiopia but also provides new insights into the epidemiology and genetic structure of Z. tritici in Africa where the agro-climatic conditions and the wheat cropping systems are different from other parts of the world. Such baseline information is useful for designing and implementing durable and effective management strategies."

"30899806","abstracttext","The present study assessed the effects of cereal type and the inclusion level of a phytogenic feed additive (PFA) on broiler ileal and cecal gut microbiota composition, volatile fatty acids (VFA) and gene expression of toll like receptors ( TLR ), tight junction proteins, mucin 2 ( MUC2 ) and secretory immunoglobulin A ( sIgA ). Depending on cereal type (i.e. maize or wheat) and PFA inclusion level (i.e. 0, 100 and 150 mg/kg diet), 450 one-day-old male broilers were allocated in 6 treatments according to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement with 5 replicates of 15 broilers each, for 42 d. Significant interactions ( P  ≤ 0.05) between cereal type and PFA were shown for cecal digesta Bacteroides and Clostridium cluster XIVa, ileal digesta propionic and branched VFA, ileal sIgA gene expression, as well as cecal digesta branched and other VFA molar ratios. Cereal type affected the cecal microbiota composition. In particular, wheat-fed broilers had higher levels of mucosa-associated Lactobacillus ( P CT  = 0.007) and digesta Bifidobacterium ( P CT  < 0.001), as well as lower levels of total bacteria ( P CT  = 0.004) and Clostridia clusters I, IV and XIVa ( P CT  ≤ 0.05), compared with maize-fed ones. In addition, cereal type gave differences in fermentation intensity ( P CT  = 0.021) and in certain individual VFA molar ratios. Wheat-fed broilers had higher ( P  ≤ 0.05) ileal zonula occluden 2 ( ZO-2 ) and lower ileal and cecal TLR2 and sIgA levels, compared with maize-fed broilers. On the other hand, PFA inclusion at 150 mg/kg had a stimulating effect on microbial fermentation at ileum and a retarding effect in ceca with additional variable VFA molar patterns. In addition, PFA inclusion at 100 mg/kg increased the ileal mucosa expression of claudin 5 ( CLDN5 ) ( P PFA  = 0.023) and MUC2 ( P PFA  = 0.001) genes, and at 150 mg/kg decreased cecal TLR2 ( P PFA  = 0.022) gene expression compared with the un-supplemented controls. In conclusion, cereal type and PFA affected in combination and independently broiler gut microbiota composition and metabolic activity as well as the expression of critical gut barrier genes including TLR2 . Further exploitation of these properties in cases of stressor challenges is warranted."
"30530713","articletitle","Rapid Parallel Evolution of Azole Fungicide Resistance in Australian Populations of the Wheat Pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici ."
"30530713","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici is a globally distributed fungal pathogen which causes Septoria tritici blotch on wheat. Management of the disease is attempted through the deployment of resistant wheat cultivars and the application of fungicides. However, fungicide resistance is commonly observed in Z. tritici populations, and continuous monitoring is required to detect breakdowns in fungicide efficacy. We recently reported azole-resistant isolates in Australia; however, it remained unknown whether resistance was brought into the continent through gene flow or whether resistance emerged independently. To address this question, we screened 43 isolates across five Australian locations for azole sensitivity and performed whole-genome sequencing on 58 isolates from seven locations to determine the genetic basis of resistance. Population genomic analyses showed extremely strong differentiation between the Australian population recovered after azoles began to be used and both Australian populations recovered before azoles began to be used and populations on different continents. The apparent absence of recent gene flow between Australia and other continents suggests that azole fungicide resistance has evolved de novo and subsequently spread within Tasmania. Despite the isolates being distinct at the whole-genome level, we observed combinations of nonsynonymous substitutions at the CYP51 locus identical to those observed elsewhere in the world. We observed nine previously reported nonsynonymous mutations as well as isolates that carried a combination of the previously reported L50S, S188N, A379G, I381V, Y459DEL, G460DEL, and N513K substitutions. Assays for the 50% effective concentration against a subset of isolates exposed to the tebuconazole and epoxiconazole fungicides showed high levels of azole resistance. The rapid, parallel evolution of a complex CYP51 haplotype that matches a dominant European haplotype demonstrates the enormous potential for de novo resistance emergence in pathogenic fungi. IMPORTANCE Fungicides are essential to control diseases in agriculture because many crops are highly susceptible to pathogens. However, many pathogens rapidly evolve resistance to fungicides. A large body of studies have described specific mutations conferring resistance and have often made inferences about the origins of resistance based on sequencing data from the target gene alone. Here, we show the de novo acquisition of resistance to the ubiquitously used azole fungicides in genetically isolated populations of the wheat pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici in Tasmania, Australia. We confirm evidence for parallel evolution through genome-scale analyses of representative worldwide populations. The emergence of complex resistance haplotypes following a well-documented recent introduction of azoles into Australian farming practices demonstrates how rapidly chemical resistance evolves in agricultural ecosystems."
"21655994","articletitle","Genetic analysis of resistance to septoria tritici blotch in the French winter wheat cultivars Balance and Apache."
"21655994","abstracttext","The ascomycete Mycosphaerella graminicola is the causal agent of septoria tritici blotch (STB), one of the most destructive foliar diseases of bread and durum wheat globally, particularly in temperate humid areas. A screening of the French bread wheat cultivars Apache and Balance with 30 M. graminicola isolates revealed a pattern of resistant responses that suggested the presence of new genes for STB resistance. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis of a doubled haploid (DH) population with five M. graminicola isolates in the seedling stage identified four QTLs on chromosomes 3AS, 1BS, 6DS and 7DS, and occasionally on 7DL. The QTL on chromosome 6DS flanked by SSR markers Xgpw5176 and Xgpw3087 is a novel QTL that now can be designated as Stb18. The QTLs on chromosomes 3AS and 1BS most likely represent Stb6 and Stb11, respectively, and the QTLs on chromosome 7DS are most probably identical with Stb4 and Stb5. However, the QTL identified on chromosome 7DL is expected to be a new Stb gene that still needs further characterization. Multiple isolates were used and show that not all isolates identify all QTLs, which clearly demonstrates the specificity in the M. graminicola-wheat pathosystem. QTL analyses were performed with various disease parameters. The development of asexual fructifications (pycnidia) in the characteristic necrotic blotches of STB, designated as parameter P, identified the maximum number of QTLs. All other parameters identified fewer but not different QTLs. The segregation of multiple QTLs in the Apache/Balance DH population enabled the identification of DH lines with single QTLs and multiple QTL combinations. Analyses of the marker data of these DH lines clearly demonstrated the positive effect of pyramiding QTLs to broaden resistance spectra as well as epistatic and additive interactions between these QTLs. Phenotyping of the Apache/Balance DH population in the field confirmed the presence of the QTLs that were identified in the seedling stage, but Stb18 was inconsistently expressed and might be particularly effective in young plants. In contrast, an additional QTL for STB resistance was identified on chromosome 2DS that is exclusively and consistently expressed in mature plants over locations and time, but it was also strongly related with earliness, tallness as well as resistance to Fusarium head blight. Although to date no Stb gene has been reported on chromosome 2D, the data provide evidence that this QTL is only indirectly related to STB resistance. This study shows that detailed genetic analysis of contemporary commercial bread wheat cultivars can unveil novel Stb genes that can be readily applied in marker-assisted breeding programs."

"29487238","abstracttext","Delineating species and epidemic lineages in fungal plant pathogens is critical to our understanding of disease emergence and the structure of fungal biodiversity and also informs international regulatory decisions. Pyricularia oryzae (syn. Magnaporthe oryzae ) is a multihost pathogen that infects multiple grasses and cereals, is responsible for the most damaging rice disease (rice blast), and is of growing concern due to the recent introduction of wheat blast to Bangladesh from South America. However, the genetic structure and evolutionary history of M. oryzae , including the possible existence of cryptic phylogenetic species, remain poorly defined. Here, we use whole-genome sequence information for 76 M. oryzae isolates sampled from 12 grass and cereal genera to infer the population structure of M. oryzae and to reassess the species status of wheat-infecting populations of the fungus. Species recognition based on genealogical concordance, using published data or extracting previously used loci from genome assemblies, failed to confirm a prior assignment of wheat blast isolates to a new species ( Pyricularia graminis-tritici ). Inference of population subdivisions revealed multiple divergent lineages within M. oryzae , each preferentially associated with one host genus, suggesting incipient speciation following host shift or host range expansion. Analyses of gene flow, taking into account the possibility of incomplete lineage sorting, revealed that genetic exchanges have contributed to the makeup of multiple lineages within M. oryzae These findings provide greater understanding of the ecoevolutionary factors that underlie the diversification of M. oryzae and highlight the practicality of genomic data for epidemiological surveillance in this important multihost pathogen. IMPORTANCE Infection of novel hosts is a major route for disease emergence by pathogenic microorganisms. Understanding the evolutionary history of multihost pathogens is therefore important to better predict the likely spread and emergence of new diseases. Magnaporthe oryzae is a multihost fungus that causes serious cereal diseases, including the devastating rice blast disease and wheat blast, a cause of growing concern due to its recent spread from South America to Asia. Using whole-genome analysis of 76 fungal strains from different hosts, we have documented the divergence of M. oryzae into numerous lineages, each infecting a limited number of host species. Our analyses provide evidence that interlineage gene flow has contributed to the genetic makeup of multiple M. oryzae lineages within the same species. Plant health surveillance is therefore warranted to safeguard against disease emergence in regions where multiple lineages of the fungus are in contact with one another."

"29780371","abstracttext","The soilborne fungus Rhizoctonia solani anastomosis group (AG) 8 is a major pathogen of grain crops resulting in substantial production losses. In the absence of resistant cultivars of wheat or barley, a sustainable and enduring method for disease control may lie in the enhancement of biological disease suppression. Evidence of effective biological control of R. solani AG8 through disease suppression has been well documented at our study site in Avon, South Australia. A comparative metatranscriptomic approach was applied to assess the taxonomic and functional characteristics of the rhizosphere microbiome of wheat plants grown in adjacent fields which are suppressive and non-suppressive to the plant pathogen R. solani AG8. Analysis of 12 rhizosphere metatranscriptomes (six per field) was undertaken using two bioinformatic approaches involving unassembled and assembled reads. Differential expression analysis showed the dominant taxa in the rhizosphere based on mRNA annotation were Arthrobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. for non-suppressive samples and Stenotrophomonas spp. and Buttiauxella spp. for the suppressive samples. The assembled metatranscriptome analysis identified more differentially expressed genes than the unassembled analysis in the comparison of suppressive and non-suppressive samples. Suppressive samples showed greater expression of a polyketide cyclase, a terpenoid biosynthesis backbone gene ( dxs ) and many cold shock proteins ( csp ). Non-suppressive samples were characterised by greater expression of antibiotic genes such as non-heme chloroperoxidase ( cpo ) which is involved in pyrrolnitrin synthesis, and phenazine biosynthesis family protein F ( phzF) and its transcriptional activator protein ( phzR ). A large number of genes involved in detoxifying reactive oxygen species (ROS) and superoxide radicals ( sod, cat, ahp, bcp, gpx1, trx ) were also expressed in the non-suppressive rhizosphere samples most likely in response to the infection of wheat roots by R. solani AG8. Together these results provide new insight into microbial gene expression in the rhizosphere of wheat in soils suppressive and non-suppressive to R. solani AG8. The approach taken and the genes involved in these functions provide direction for future studies to determine more precisely the molecular interplay of plant-microbe-pathogen interactions with the ultimate goal of the development of management options that promote beneficial rhizosphere microflora to reduce R. solani AG8 infection of crops."

"32655598","abstracttext","Wheat adaptability to a wide range of environmental conditions is mostly determined by allelic diversity within genes controlling vernalization requirement ( Vrn-1 ) and photoperiod sensitivity ( Ppd-1 ). We characterized a panel of 151 durum wheat Mediterranean landraces and 20 representative locally adapted modern cultivars for their allelic composition at Vrn-1 and Ppd-1 gene using diagnostic molecular markers and studied their association with the time needed to reach six growth stages under field conditions over 6 years. Compared with the more diverse and representative landrace collection, the set of modern cultivars were characterized by a reduction of 50% in the number of allelic variants at the Vrn-A1 and Vrn-B1 genes, and the high frequency of mutant alleles conferring photoperiod insensitivity at Ppd-A1 , which resulted on a shorter cycle length. Vrn-A1 played a greater role than Vrn-B1 in regulating crop development ( Vrn-A1 > Vrn-B1 ). The results suggest that mutations in the Vrn-A1 gene may have been the most important in establishing the spring growth habit of Mediterranean landraces and modern durum cultivars. The allele Vrn-A1d , found in 10 landraces, delayed development. The relative effects of single Vrn-A1 alleles on delaying the development of the landraces were vrn-A1 = Vrn-A1d > Vrn-A1b > Vrn-A1c . Allele vrn-B1 was present in all except two landraces and in all modern cultivars. The null allele at Ppd-A1 (a deletion first observed in the French bread wheat cultivar 'Capelle-Desprez') was found for the first time in durum wheat in the present study that identified it in 30 landraces from 13 Mediterranean countries. Allele Ppd-A1a ( GS105 ) was detected in both germplasm types, while the allele Ppd-A1a ( GS100 ) was found only in modern North American and Spanish cultivars. The relative effect of single Ppd-A1 alleles on extending phenological development was Ppd-A1 ( DelCD ) > Ppd-A1b > Ppd-A1a ( GS105 ) > Ppd-A1a ( GS100 ). Sixteen Vrn-1+Ppd-1 allelic combinations were found in landraces and six in modern cultivars, but only three were common to both panels. Differences in the number of days to reach anthesis were 10 days in landraces and 3 days in modern cultivars. Interactive effects between Vrn-1 and Ppd-1 genes were detected."

"30722363","abstracttext","Wheat stripe rust (yellow rust [Yr]), caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is an economically important disease of wheat worldwide. Virulence information on P. striiformis f. sp. tritici populations is important to implement effective disease control with resistant cultivars. In total, 235 P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates from Algeria, Australia, Canada, Chile, China, Hungary, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and Uzbekistan were tested on 20 single Yr-gene lines and the 20 wheat genotypes that are used to differentiate P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races in the United States. The 235 isolates were identified as 129 virulence patterns on the single-gene lines and 169 virulence patterns on the U.S. differentials. Virulences to YrA, Yr2, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr9, Yr17, Yr25, YrUkn, Yr28, Yr31, YrExp2, Lemhi (Yr21), Paha (YrPa1, YrPa2, YrPa3), Druchamp (Yr3a, YrD, YrDru), Produra (YrPr1, YrPr2), Stephens (Yr3a, YrS, YrSte), Lee (Yr7, Yr22, Yr23), Fielder (Yr6, Yr20), Tyee (YrTye), Tres (YrTr1, YrTr2), Express (YrExp1, YrExp2), Clement (Yr9, YrCle), and Compair (Yr8, Yr19) were detected in all countries. At least 80% of the isolates were virulent on YrA, Yr2, Yr6, Yr7, Yr8, Yr17, YrUkn, Yr31, YrExp2, Yr21, Stephens (Yr3a, YrS, YrSte), Lee (Yr7, Yr22, Yr23), and Fielder (Yr6, Yr20). Virulences to Yr1, Yr9, Yr25, Yr27, Yr28, Heines VII (Yr2, YrHVII), Paha (YrPa1, YrPa2, YrPa3), Druchamp (Yr3a, YrD, YrDru), Produra (YrPr1, YrPr2), Yamhill (Yr2, Yr4a, YrYam), Tyee (YrTye), Tres (YrTr1, YrTr2), Hyak (Yr17, YrTye), Express (YrExp1, YrExp2), Clement (Yr9, YrCle), and Compair (Yr8, Yr19) were moderately frequent (>20 to <80%). Virulence to Yr10, Yr24, Yr32, YrSP, and Moro (Yr10, YrMor) was low (≤20%). Virulence to Moro was absent in Algeria, Australia, Canada, Kenya, Russia, Spain, Turkey, and China, but 5% of the Chinese isolates were virulent to Yr10. None of the isolates from Algeria, Canada, China, Kenya, Russia, and Spain was virulent to Yr24; none of the isolates from Algeria, Australia, Canada, Nepal, Russia, and Spain was virulent to Yr32; none of the isolates from Australia, Canada, Chile, Hungary, Kenya, Kenya, Nepal, Pakistan, Russia, and Spain was virulent to YrSP; and none of the isolates from any country was virulent to Yr5 and Yr15. Although the frequencies of virulence factors were different, most of the P. striiformis f. sp. tritici isolates from these countries shared common virulence factors. The virulences and their frequencies and distributions should be useful in breeding stripe-rust-resistant wheat cultivars and understanding the pathogen migration and evolution."

"31286893","abstracttext_background","Premature senescence of flag leaf severely affects wheat yield and quality. Chlorophyll (Chl) degradation is the most obvious symptom during leaf senescence and catalyzed by a series of enzymes. Pheophytin pheophorbide hydrolase (Pheophytinase, PPH) gene encodes a Chl degradation hydrolase."
"31286893","abstracttext_results","In this study, the coding, genomic and promoter sequences of wheat TaPPH-A gene were cloned. The corresponding lengths were 1467 bp, 4479 bp and 3666 bp, respectively. Sequence structure analysis showed that TaPPH-A contained five exons and four introns. After the multiple sequences alignment of TaPPH-A genome from 36 accessions in a wheat diversity panel, four SNPs and one 2-bp InDel were observed, which formed two haplotypes, TaPPH-7A-1 and TaPPH-7A-2. Based on the SNP at 1299 bp (A/G), a molecular marker TaPPH-7A-dCAPS was developed to distinguish allelic variation (A/G). Using the molecular markers, 13 SSR, and 116 SNP markers, a linkage map of chromosome 7A were integrated. TaPPH-A was mapped on the chromosome region flanked by Xwmc9 (0.94 cM) and AX-95634545 (1.04 cM) on 7A in a DH population. Association analysis between TaPPH-7A allelic variation and agronomic traits found that TaPPH-7A was associated with TGW in 11 of 12 environments and Chl content at grain-filling stage under drought stress using Population 1 consisted of 323 accessions. The accessions possessed TaPPH-7A-1 (A) had higher TGW and Chl content than those possessed TaPPH-7A-2 (G), thus TaPPH-7A-1 (A) was a favorable allelic variation. By analyzing the frequency of favorable allelic variation TaPPH-7A-1 (A) in Population 2 with 157 landraces and Population 3 with 348 modern cultivars, we found it increased from pre-1950 (0) to 1960s (54.5%), then maintained a relatively stable level about 56% from 1960s to 1990s."
"31286893","abstracttext_conclusion","These results suggested the favorable allelic variation TaPPH-7A-1 (A) should be valuable in enhancing grain yield by improving the source (chlorophyll content) and sink (the developing grain) simultaneously. Furthermore, the newly developed molecular marker TaPPH-7A-dCAPS could be integrated into a breeding kit of screening high TGW wheat for marker-assisted selection."

"19199095","abstracttext","Somatic hybridization between bread wheat and tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum) has generated fertile introgression progenies with novel combinations of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS). Most of these novel HMW-GS alleles were stably inherited. Sixteen HMW-GS sequences were PCR amplified from three introgression progeny lines and sequenced. The alignment of these sequences indicated that five, probably derived from point mutations of the parental genes, whereas eight likely represent the product of replication slippage. Three Glu-1Ay sequences appear to have lost the transposon presented in the parental gene. Two subunits carry an additional cysteine residue, which may be favorable to the quality of end-use product. We demonstrate that novel HMW-GS alleles can be rapidly generated via asymmetric somatic hybridization."
"19305410","articletitle","Natural variation at the DEP1 locus enhances grain yield in rice."
"19305410","abstracttext","Grain yield is controlled by quantitative trait loci (QTLs) derived from natural variations in many crop plants. Here we report the molecular characterization of a major rice grain yield QTL that acts through the determination of panicle architecture. The dominant allele at the DEP1 locus is a gain-of-function mutation causing truncation of a phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein-like domain protein. The effect of this allele is to enhance meristematic activity, resulting in a reduced length of the inflorescence internode, an increased number of grains per panicle and a consequent increase in grain yield. This allele is common to many Chinese high-yielding rice varieties and likely represents a relatively recent introduction into the cultivated rice gene pool. We also show that a functionally equivalent allele is present in the temperate cereals and seems to have arisen before the divergence of the wheat and barley lineages."
"19406250","articletitle","Nutrient profiling reveals potent inducers of trichothecene biosynthesis in Fusarium graminearum."
"19406250","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight is one of the most important diseases of wheat worldwide due to crop losses and the contamination of grains with trichothecene mycotoxins. The biosynthesis of trichothecenes by Fusarium spp. is highest during infection, but relatively low levels are produced from saprophytic growth in axenic culture. A strain of Fusarium graminearum was constructed where the promoter from the TRI5 trichothecene biosynthesis gene was fused to GFP. Using this strain in large-scale nutrient profiling, a variety of amines were identified that significantly induce TRI5 expression. Analysis of trichothecene levels in the culture filtrates revealed accumulation of the toxin to over 1000ppm in response to these inducers, levels either greater than or equivalent to those observed during infection. From this work, we propose that products of the arginine-polyamine biosynthetic pathway in plants may play a role in the induction of trichothecene biosynthesis during infection."
"25534513","articletitle","Photoperiodic flowering: time measurement mechanisms in leaves."
"25534513","abstracttext","Many plants use information about changing day length (photoperiod) to align their flowering time with seasonal changes to increase reproductive success. A mechanism for photoperiodic time measurement is present in leaves, and the day-length-specific induction of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene, which encodes florigen, is a major final output of the pathway. Here, we summarize the current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which photoperiodic information is perceived in order to trigger FT expression in Arabidopsis as well as in the primary cereals wheat, barley, and rice. In these plants, the differences in photoperiod are measured by interactions between circadian-clock-regulated components, such as CONSTANS (CO), and light signaling. The interactions happen under certain day-length conditions, as previously predicted by the external coincidence model. In these plants, the coincidence mechanisms are governed by multilayered regulation with numerous conserved as well as unique regulatory components, highlighting the breadth of photoperiodic regulation across plant species."

"25576223","abstracttext","Two nearly complete mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) of wheat stem borers, Cephus pygmeus and Cephus sareptanus (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), were sequenced, characterised and compared with the previously known mitogenome of Cephus cinctus. The gene orders are mostly conserved, except for translocation of trnM and swapped position of trnI and trnQ. An A+T bias was found, but a deviation from strand asymmetry was also detected on the J strand. All protein coding genes (PCGs) are initiated by ATN codons, except for nad1, nad2 and atp8, and all are terminated with TAA, TA- or T- as a stop codon. The predicted secondary structures of rrnS and rrnL genes are mostly consistent with reported hymenopteran species. However, an unusual elongation in rrnS, not know elsewhere in the order, was discovered in Cephus species. Three autonomous sequences detected in domains I and II are mainly responsible for the length expansions."

"25494463","abstracttext","Maize occupies dual roles as both (a) one of the big-three grain species (along with rice and wheat) responsible for providing more than half of the calories consumed around the world, and (b) a model system for plant genetics and cytogenetics dating back to the origin of the field of genetics in the early twentieth century. The long history of genetic investigation in this species combined with modern genomic and quantitative genetic data has provided particular insight into the characteristics of genes linked to phenotypes and how these genes differ from many other sequences in plant genomes that are not easily distinguishable based on molecular data alone. These recent results suggest that the number of genes in plants that make significant contributions to phenotype may be lower than the number of genes defined by current molecular criteria, and also indicate that syntenic conservation has been underemphasized as a marker for gene function."

"25462079","abstracttext","Expansins are cell wall proteins inducing cell wall loosening and participate in all plant growth and development processes which are associated with cell wall modifications. Here, TaEXPB23, a wheat expansin gene, was investigated and the tolerance to oxidative stress was strongly enhanced in over-expression tobacco plants. Our results revealed that over-expressing TaEXPB23 influenced the activity of antioxidant enzymes: in particular, the activity of the cell wall-bound peroxidase. The enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress and increased cell wall-bound peroxidase activity were partly inhibited by an anti-expansin antibody. The Arabidopsis expansin mutant atexpb2 showed reduced cell wall-bound peroxidase activity and decreased oxidative stress tolerance. In addition, atexpb2 exhibited lower chlorophyll contents and the germination rate compared to wild type (WT). Taken together, these results provided a new insight on the role of expansin proteins in plant stress tolerance by cell wall bound peroxidase."

"32067057","abstracttext","Malachite green is a carcinogenic dye that has been detected in fish tissues and freshwater. Here we evaluated the malachite green decoloring ability of a photoautotrophic cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (Synechococcus), that lives in freshwater. Results show that 99.5% of the dye was removed by Synechococcus through bioabsorption and bioaccumulation; however, the dye was not degraded or chemically modified. Next, we established an engineered Synechococcus strain to degrade the dye after uptake. The triphenylmethane reductase gene katmr was heterologously expressed, resulting in high production of a soluble recombinant protein. The engineered strain showed advanced decoloring abilities at a low cell density and in stressful environments. It degraded malachite green into the smaller molecules 4-methylaminobenzoic acid and 4-hydroxyl-aniline. After treatment with the engineered cyanobacterium, the growth of wheat seeds was fully recovered in the presence of malachite green. These results demonstrate the potential application of the engineered Synechococcus as a photosynthetic cell factory for the removal of malachite green from wastewater."

"33169035","abstracttext","New breeding technologies accelerate germplasm improvement and reduce the cost of goods in seed production 1-3 . Many such technologies could use in vivo paternal haploid induction (HI), which occurs when double fertilization precedes maternal (egg cell) genome loss. Engineering of the essential CENTROMERIC HISTONE (CENH3) gene induces paternal HI in Arabidopsis 4-6 . Despite conservation of CENH3 function across crops, CENH3-based HI has not been successful outside of the Arabidopsis model system 7 . Here we report a commercially operable paternal HI line in wheat with a ~7% HI rate, identified by screening genome-edited TaCENH3α-heteroallelic combinations. Unlike in Arabidopsis, edited alleles exhibited reduced transmission in female gametophytes, and heterozygous genotypes triggered higher HI rates than homozygous combinations. These developments might pave the way for the deployment of CENH3 HI technology in diverse crops."
"1148382","articletitle","Gluten-sensitive enteropathy."
"1148382","abstracttext","Gluten-sensitive enteropathy is a disease characterized by villous atrophy related to the ingestion of wheat protein, gluten. In the present series of studies it was shown that gluten ingestion in affected patients is promptly followed by a local immune reaction involving the production of antigluten antibodies. An in vitro model of gluten enteropathy involving the organ culture of biopsy tissue has been developed which has led to the conclusion that gluten is not directly toxic to the gastrointestional mucosa but, instead, brings about tissue damage through the activation of an endogenous mechanism, presumably the immune system. An additional insight into the pathogenesis of gluten-sensitive enteropathy is afforded by the fact that some 90% of patients carry the HL-A8 histocompatibility type. This may be a marker for the presence of an abnormal immune response gene or may determine the presence of abnormal gluten-protein receptor sites on epithelial cells. Either of these abnormalities could result in a propensity to respond immunologically to gluten, with destructive consequences."

Subcellular fractionation showed that the D. discoideum and Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteins recognized by the antibodies are associated with the ribosomal fraction. After separation and purification of the 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits of D. discoideum, the ubex52 protein was exclusively recovered in the small subunit."

"2302732","abstracttext","In response to water spray, subirrigation, wind, touch, wounding, or darkness, Arabidopsis regulates the expression of at least four touch-induced (TCH) genes. Ten to thirty minutes after stimulation, mRNA levels increase up to 100-fold. Arabidopsis plants stimulated by touch develop shorter petioles and bolts. This developmental response is known as thigmomorphogenesis. TCH 1 cDNA encodes the putative Arabidopsis calmodulin differing in one amino acid from wheat calmodulin. Sequenced regions of TCH 2 and TCH 3 contain 44% and 70% amino acid identities to calmodulin, respectively. The regulation of this calmodulin-related gene family in Arabidopsis suggests that calcium ions and calmodulin are involved in transduction of signals from the environment, enabling plants to sense and respond to environmental changes."

No difference could be detected between the translation products of 35S RNA from nondefective and transformation-defective RSV virions, nor of 35S RNA from different strains of RSV. The 76,000-molecular-weight polypeptide synthesized in response to 35S RNA in vitro was labeled with formyl-methionine from initiator tRNA. Models for viral protein synthesis are discussed in the light of these results, and arguments positioning the group-specific antigen gene at the 5' end of the 35S RNA are presented."

"1508689","abstracttext","The replication of shuttle vectors derived from Wheat Dwarf Virus, a monopartite geminivirus, was studied in cultured maize endosperm cells, and in the Black Mexican Sweet (BMS) maize cell line. Using in vivo labeling and DNA methylation analysis, we showed that replication was initiated within 24 hrs after transfection, and did not require cell division in both cell lines. Copy numbers of 30,000 ds DNA molecules per cell were observed in endosperm cells after three days. The replication protein was shown to act in trans, since the wild type gene of the shuttle vector enabled replication-deficient vectors carrying mutated genes to replicate. These properties suggest that WDV may have similar applications in plants as SV40 in mammalian cells."

Messenger RNA isolated from the bone marrow of the patient was translated in the wheat germ cell-free system, and the globin synthesized had an alpha/betas ratio of 0.7. The hemolysate prepared from incubated bone marrow cells was fractionated on a Sephadex G100 column. The results showed that there was a peak of radioactivity that eluted after the hemoglobin peak. When this pooled peak was analyzed by CMC chromatography, the alpha/betas ratio was 0.9. These globin intermediates, probably dimers, may have contributed to the hemolysis in this patient."

"658054","abstracttext","Total brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA, comprising four mRNA molecules, was translated in the wheat germ system. It was shown that at a low ratio of total BMV RNA to cell-free extract all four BMV genes were expressed. At a high excess of total BMV RNA over the cell-free extract, the only BMV gene translated was the coat protein cistron (RNA 4). The effect was due to diminished initiation of synthesis of non-coat proteins in the presence of a high excess of template over 23 000 X g extract. This leads to exclusion from the translational machinery of all but coat protein genes. The effect is responsible for regulation of expression of BMV genes in vitro and can be of importance for enhancement of coat protein synthesis as expected in the late phase of virus development in vivo."

"3049597","abstracttext","In order to determine if the cognate transit peptide of the light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein (LHCP) is essential for LHCP import into the chloroplast and proper localization to the thylakoids, it was replaced with the transit peptide of the small subunit (S) of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase, a stromal protein. Wheat LHCP and S genes were fused to make a chimeric gene coding for the hybrid precursor, which was synthesized in vitro and incubated with purified pea chloroplasts. My results show that LHCP is translocated into chloroplasts by the S transit peptide. The hybrid precursor was processed; and most importantly, mature LHCP did not remain in the stroma, but was inserted into thylakoid membranes, where it normally functions. Density gradient centrifugation showed no LHCP in the envelope fraction. Hence, the transit peptide of LHCP is not required for intraorganellar routing, and LHCP itself contains an internal signal for localization to the correct membrane compartment."
"2424603","articletitle","Distribution of calcitonin gene-related peptide-containing fibers in the urinary bladder of the rat and their origin."
"2424603","abstracttext","By use of indirect immunofluorescence, this study demonstrated the presence of calcitonin gene-related peptide-like immunoreactive (CGRPI) fibers in the bladder of the rat. These fibers were abundant in the muscle layer, in which they ran parallel to the muscles, submucosa, and epithelium. No immunoreactive cells were detected. We also examined the origins of these fibers, using a method that combined biotinized retrograde tracer (biotin-wheat germ agglutinin) (B-WGA) and immunocytochemistry. Injection of the tracer into the bladder resulted in the demonstration of small to medium-sized labeled cells that contain CGRPI structures in single dorsal root ganglion cells mostly at the level of L6 and S1, but also a few at L2. Double-staining for CGRPI and immunoreactive P-like substance (SPI) indicated that there are cells in the dorsal root ganglia at the level of L6 and S1 that react to both, but that there are many CGRPI-positive cells that contain no demonstrable SPI; most of the latter are large."
"2470489","articletitle","B-cell lymphoma marking only with anti-epithelial membrane antigen."
"2470489","abstracttext","A large cell malignancy identified as a B-lymphoma only by virtue of mu and kappa chain gene rearrangement additionally displayed profuse plasmalemma marking with anti-epithelial membrane antigen (EMA). Affinity absorption of the antibody with N-acetyl-galactosamine but not with N-acetylglucosamine or d-galactose effectively removed the lymphoma reactive antibodies. Soy bean agglutinin but not wheat germ agglutinin demonstrated lectin activity towards an epitope on the lymphoma membrane. Finally, digestion of cryostat sections of the lymphoma with N-acetylgalactosaminidase effectively removed the sugar epitope involved in EMA marking. Such data taken together would tend to indicate a membrane positioned complex carbohydrate with galactosamine dominancy. By analogy to the purported ""late differentiation antigen secretory function"" of EMA this lymphoma may be close to plasma cell stage."
"2644135","articletitle","A 10 kDa polypeptide associated with the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II has a putative C-terminal non-cleavable thylakoid transfer domain."
"2644135","abstracttext","The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the 10 kDa polypeptide associated with the oxygen-evolving complex of wheat photosystem II has been determined and shown to be homologous to the amino acid sequence of the product of the ST-LS1 gene from potato. The N-terminal sequence of the mature protein indicates that the polypeptide is synthesized with a 39 amino acid N-terminal presequence which is similar to chloroplast import sequences but which lacks a hydrophobic domain for transfer of the protein across the thylakoid membrane. The mature polypeptide has a C-terminal hydrophobic region which shows homology to the hydrophobic thylakoid transfer domain of other lumenal proteins and this hydrophobic region of the 10 kDa polypeptide is suggested to facilitate transfer of the protein across the thylakoid membrane."
"2736625","articletitle","A glycosylated liver-specific transcription factor stimulates transcription of the albumin gene."
"2736625","abstracttext","HNF1 is a liver-specific transcription factor that plays the dominant role in determining the cell type-specific in vitro transcription of the albumin gene. Here we report the purification and preliminary characterization of HNF1. HNF1 appears to be heavily glycosylated since it is retained on a wheat germ agglutinin-agarose column and can be eluted from it with N-acetylglucosamine, a property not observed with other factors binding to the albumin promoter. Using in vitro transcription assays we demonstrate that purified HNF1 strongly stimulates albumin promoter activity in spleen nuclear extracts, which are devoid of this factor. Likewise, an artificial promoter consisting of two HNF1 recognition sites in front of a TATA motif is strongly activated by HNF1 in such extracts. In addition to stimulating transcription directly by binding to its cognate site, HNF1 may further enhance albumin promoter activity by interacting cooperatively with other trans-acting factors."
"2662966","articletitle","Unusual features of cereal seed protein structure and evolution."
"2662966","abstracttext","The alcohol-soluble (prolamin) storage proteins of barley, wheat and rye vary in their structures, but all have two features in common: the presence of distinct structural domains differing in amino acid compositions, and of repeats within one of these domains. Detailed comparisons of amino acid sequences show that all appear to have evolved from a single ancestral gene consisting of three short related regions (called A, B and C). Regions related to A, B and C are also present in the minor prolamins of maize and in three other groups of seed proteins: inhibitors of alpha-amylase and/or trypsin from cereals. 25 storage globulins from several dicotyledonous species and a 2S albumin from sunflower. It is suggested that these proteins together constitute a protein superfamily with limited sequence homology."
"3818572","articletitle","Wheat germ trypsin inhibitors. Isolation and structural characterization of single-headed and double-headed inhibitors of the Bowman-Birk type."
"3818572","abstracttext","A number of trypsin inhibitors were isolated from wheat germs by affinity chromatography on immobilized trypsin, gel-filtration, and ion-exchange and reverse-phase chromatography. These inhibitors were classified into two groups, inhibitors I (Mr = 14,500) and II (Mr = 7,000), based on their molecular sizes. Inhibitors I and II inhibited bovine trypsin stoichiometorically at an enzyme to inhibitor ratio of 2 and 1, respectively. Sequence analysis of these inhibitors indicated a high degree of homology and that inhibitors I had a duplicated structure of inhibitors II. They are highly homologous to double-headed proteinase inhibitors (Bowman-Birk inhibitors) of Leguminosae plants. Inhibitors II are the first example of single-headed inhibitor corresponding to one inhibitory domain of the Bowman-Birk type double-headed inhibitors, which suggests that inhibitors II are relic of an ancestral single-headed inhibitor before the gene-duplication that led to the formation of present-day Bowman-Birk type inhibitors."
"3827863","articletitle","Synthesis of the small subunit of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase from genes cloned into plasmids containing the SP6 promoter."
"3827863","abstracttext","DNA sequences encoding ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase small subunit precursor from Pisum sativum L. have been transcribed from plasmids containing the SP6 promoter, and translated in a wheat germ cell-free system. The small subunit precursor polypeptide, its N-terminal leader sequence (transit peptide) and the mature small subunit have each been synthesized independently from three different plasmid constructs. The precursor polypeptide is imported into isolated pea chloroplasts and processed to the mature small subunit by a stromal proteinase. The mature polypeptide is neither imported, nor subject to proteolysis by stromal extracts. The transit peptide alone is very rapidly degraded by a stromal proteinase activity which can be inhibited by EDTA or 1,10-phenanthroline. The use of these gene constructs helps to establish the crucial role of the transit peptide in protein import into the chloroplast."
