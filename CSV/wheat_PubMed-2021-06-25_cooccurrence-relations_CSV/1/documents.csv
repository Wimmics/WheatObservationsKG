"24104565","articletitle","Reticulate evolution of the rye genome."
"24104565","abstracttext","Rye (Secale cereale) is closely related to wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Due to its large genome (~8 Gb) and its regional importance, genome analysis of rye has lagged behind other cereals. Here, we established a virtual linear gene order model (genome zipper) comprising 22,426 or 72% of the detected set of 31,008 rye genes. This was achieved by high-throughput transcript mapping, chromosome survey sequencing, and integration of conserved synteny information of three sequenced model grass genomes (Brachypodium distachyon, rice [Oryza sativa], and sorghum [Sorghum bicolor]). This enabled a genome-wide high-density comparative analysis of rye/barley/model grass genome synteny. Seventeen conserved syntenic linkage blocks making up the rye and barley genomes were defined in comparison to model grass genomes. Six major translocations shaped the modern rye genome in comparison to a putative Triticeae ancestral genome. Strikingly dissimilar conserved syntenic gene content, gene sequence diversity signatures, and phylogenetic networks were found for individual rye syntenic blocks. This indicates that introgressive hybridizations (diploid or polyploidy hybrid speciation) and/or a series of whole-genome or chromosome duplications played a role in rye speciation and genome evolution."
"25818702","articletitle","The barley Uniculme4 gene encodes a BLADE-ON-PETIOLE-like protein that controls tillering and leaf patterning."
"25818702","abstracttext","Tillers are vegetative branches that develop from axillary buds located in the leaf axils at the base of many grasses. Genetic manipulation of tillering is a major objective in breeding for improved cereal yields and competition with weeds. Despite this, very little is known about the molecular genetic bases of tiller development in important Triticeae crops such as barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum). Recessive mutations at the barley Uniculme4 (Cul4) locus cause reduced tillering, deregulation of the number of axillary buds in an axil, and alterations in leaf proximal-distal patterning. We isolated the Cul4 gene by positional cloning and showed that it encodes a BROAD-COMPLEX, TRAMTRACK, BRIC-À-BRAC-ankyrin protein closely related to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BLADE-ON-PETIOLE1 (BOP1) and BOP2. Morphological, histological, and in situ RNA expression analyses indicate that Cul4 acts at axil and leaf boundary regions to control axillary bud differentiation as well as the development of the ligule, which separates the distal blade and proximal sheath of the leaf. As, to our knowledge, the first functionally characterized BOP gene in monocots, Cul4 suggests the partial conservation of BOP gene function between dicots and monocots, while phylogenetic analyses highlight distinct evolutionary patterns in the two lineages."
"26476792","articletitle","Wheat TaSP gene improves salt tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana."
"26476792","abstracttext","A novel salt-induced gene with unknown functions was cloned through analysis of gene expression profile of a salt-tolerant wheat mutant RH8706-49 under salt stress. The gene was named Triticum aestivum salt-related protein (TaSP) and deposited in GenBank (Accession No. KF307326). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) results showed that TaSP expression was induced under salt, abscisic acid (ABA), and polyethylene glycol (PEG) stresses. Subcellular localization revealed that TaSP was mainly localized in cell membrane. Overexpression of TaSP in Arabidopsis could improve salt tolerance of 35S::TaSP transgenic Arabidopsis. 35S::TaSP transgenic Arabidopsis lines after salt stress presented better physiological indexes than the control group. In the non-invasive micro-test (NMT), an evident Na(+) excretion was observed at the root tip of salt-stressed 35S::TaSP transgenic Arabidopsis. TaSP promoter was cloned, and its beta-glucuronidase (GUS) activities before and after ABA, salt, cold, heat, and salicylic acid (SA) stresses were determined. Full-length TaSP promoter contained ABA and salt response elements."
"29320529","articletitle","How exogenous nitric oxide regulates nitrogen assimilation in wheat seedlings under different nitrogen sources and levels."
"29320529","abstracttext","Nitrogen (N) is one of the most important nutrients for plants and nitric oxide (NO) as a signaling plant growth regulator involved in nitrogen assimilation. Understanding the influence of exogenous NO on nitrogen metabolism at the gene expression and enzyme activity levels under different sources of nitrogen is vitally important for increasing nitrogen use efficiency (NUE). This study investigated the expression of key genes and enzymes in relation to nitrogen assimilation in two Australian wheat cultivars, a popular high NUE cv. Spitfire and a normal NUE cv. Westonia, under different combinations of nitrogen and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) as the NO donor. Application of NO increased the gene expressions and activities of nitrogen assimilation pathway enzymes in both cultivars at low levels of nitrogen. At high nitrogen supplies, the expressions and activities of N assimilation genes increased in response to exogenous NO only in cv. Spitfire but not in cv. Westonia. Exogenous NO caused an increase in leaf NO content at low N supplies in both cultivars, while under high nitrogen treatments, cv. Spitfire showed an increase under ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) treatment but cv. Westonia was not affected. N assimilation gene expression and enzyme activity showed a clear relationship between exogenous NO, N concentration and N forms in primary plant nitrogen assimilation. Results reveal the possible role of NO and different nitrogen sources on nitrogen assimilation in Triticum aestivum plants."
"32145229","articletitle","Genome-wide identification and analysis of the Q-type C2H2 gene family in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)."
"32145229","abstracttext","Plant Q-type C2H2 zinc finger proteins play an important role in plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. Although the Q-type C2H2 gene family has been identified in many plants, little is known about it in potato (Solanum tuberosum). In the present study, a total of 79 Q-type C2H2 proteins in potato (StZFPs) were identified and their distribution on chromosomes, gene structure, and conserved motifs was assessed. According to their protein structural and phylogenetic features, these 79 StZFPs were classified into 12 distinct subclasses. Collinearity analysis showed that tandem and segmental duplication events played a crucial role in expansion of the StZFP gene family. Synteny analysis indicated that 11 and 21 StZFP genes were orthologous to Arabidopsis and wheat (Triticum aestivum), respectively. RNA-seq data were used to analyze the tissue-specific expression and abiotic stress responses of the StZFP genes. Furthermore, we analyzed the expression of StZFP genes in drought-sensitive and drought-tolerant potato cultivars under drought stress. Subsequently, we used qPCR (Quantitative real-time-PCR) to calculate the relative expression of candidate genes in potato plantlets treated with NaCl (100 mM) and PEG 6000 (10% w/v) for 24 h. Such candidate genes could provide valuable information for abiotic stress resistance research in potato."
"32481135","articletitle","Germanium as a tool to dissect boron toxicity effects in barley and wheat."
"32481135","abstracttext","Tolerance to boron (B) toxicity in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) is partially attributable to HvNIP2;1, an aquaporin with permeability to B, as well as to silicon, arsenic and germanium (Ge). In this study, we mapped leaf symptoms of Ge toxicity in a doubled-haploid barley population (Clipper×Sahara 3771). Two quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with Ge toxicity symptoms were identified, located on Chromosomes 6H and 2H. These QTL co-located with two of four B toxicity tolerance loci previously mapped in the same population. The B toxicity tolerance gene underlying the 6H locus encodes HvNIP2;1, whereas the gene(s) and mechanisms underlying the 2H locus are as yet unknown. We provide examples of the application of Ge in studying specific aspects of B toxicity tolerance in plants, including screening of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley populations for altered function of HvNIP2;1 and related proteins. In particular, Ge may facilitate elucidation of the mechanism and gene(s) underlying the barley Chromosome 2H B tolerance locus."
"32671269","articletitle","Expression of SidD gene and physiological characterization of the rhizosphere plant growth-promoting yeasts."
"32671269","abstracttext","There is increasing evidence that rhizosphere microbes contribute to the stress mitigation process, but the mechanisms of this plant-microbe interaction are not yet understood. Siderophores-producing microorganisms have been considered important for enhancing metal tolerance in plants. In this study, rhizosphere yeasts were isolated from wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and examined for siderophores production and heavy metal resistance. Out of thirty-five isolates, only eight yeast strains showed heavy metal-resistance and plant-growth promotion properties. The highest inorganic phosphate-solubilization was shown by Trichosporon ovoides IFM 63839 (2.98 mg ml -1 ) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae FI25-1F (2.54 mg ml -1 ). Two strains, namely YEAST-6 and YEAST-16 showed high siderophore production and heavy metal-resistance, were investigated for sidD gene expression under different levels of Cd 2+ and Pb 2+ toxicity stress. The heavy metal-resistant yeast strains were characterized and identified based on the phenotypic characteristics and their 18S rRNA genes sequence. SidD gene expression was induced by yeasts growing under iron-limiting conditions and excess of other heavy metal, suggesting that expression of sidD gene increases in the presence of 600-800 μM heavy metal but under iron limitation. Extensive studies of the microbe-plant micronutrient interactions will enrich our understanding of the rhizosphere role in the terms of plant growth promotion."
"18800227","articletitle","Characterization of the TaAIDFa gene encoding a CRT/DRE-binding factor responsive to drought, high-salt, and cold stress in wheat."
"18800227","abstracttext","Dehydration responsive element-binding factors (DBFs) belong to the AP2/ERF superfamily and play vital regulatory roles in abiotic stress responses in plants. In this study, we isolated three novel homologs of the DBF gene family in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by screening a drought-induced cDNA library and designated them as TaAIDFs (T. aestivum abiotic stress-induced DBFs). Compared to TaAIDFb and TaAIDFc, TaAIDFa lacks a short Ser/Thr-rich region, a putative phosphorylation site, following the AP2/ERF domain. The TaAIDFa gene, located on chromosome 3BS, is interrupted by a single intron at the 17th Arg (R) in the N-terminal domain. The N-terminal region of the TaAIDFa protein modulates nuclear localization. The TaAIDFa protein is capable of binding to CRT/DRE elements in vitro and in vivo, and of trans-activating reporter gene expression in yeast cells. The TaAIDFa promoter, with various stress-related cis-acting elements, drives expression of the GUS reporter gene in wheat calli under stress conditions. This was further confirmed by responses of TaAIDFa transcripts to drought, salinity, low-temperature, and exogenous ABA. Furthermore, overexpression of TaAIDFa activated CRT/DRE-containing genes under normal growth conditions, and improved drought and osmotic stress tolerances in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. These results suggested that TaAIDFa encodes a CRT/DRE element-binding factor that might be involved in multiple abiotic stress signal transduction pathways."
"26581444","articletitle","Genome-wide identification and evolutionary analyses of bZIP transcription factors in wheat and its relatives and expression profiles of anther development related TabZIP genes."
"26581444","abstracttext_background","Among the largest and most diverse transcription factor families in plants, basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family participate in regulating various processes, including floral induction and development, stress and hormone signaling, photomorphogenesis, seed maturation and germination, and pathogen defense. Although common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world, there is no comprehensive analysis of bZIPs in wheat, especially those involved in anther development. Previous studies have demonstrated wheat, T. urartu, Ae. tauschii, barley and Brachypodium are evolutionarily close in Gramineae family, however, the real evolutionary relationship still remains mysterious."
"26581444","abstracttext_results","In this study, 187 bZIP family genes were comprehensively identified from current wheat genome. 98, 96 and 107 members of bZIP family were also identified from the genomes of T.urartu, Ae.tauschii and barley, respectively. Orthology analyses suggested 69.4 % of TubZIPs were orthologous to 68.8 % of AetbZIPs and wheat had many more in-paralogs in the bZIP family than its relatives. It was deduced wheat had a closer phylogenetic relationship with barley and Brachypodium than T.urartu and Ae.tauschii. bZIP proteins in wheat, T.urartu and Ae.tauschii were divided into 14 subgroups based on phylogenetic analyses. Using Affymetrix microarray data, 48 differentially expressed TabZIP genes were identified to be related to anther development from comparison between the male sterility line and the restorer line. Genes with close evolutionary relationship tended to share similar gene structures. 15 of 23 selected TabZIP genes contained LTR elements in their promoter regions. Expression of 21 among these 23 TabZIP genes were obviously responsive to low temperature. These 23 TabZIP genes all exhibited distinct tissue-specific expression pattern. Among them, 11 TabZIP genes were predominantly expressed in anther and most of them showed over-dominance expression mode in the cross combination TY806 × BS366."
"26581444","abstracttext_conclusions","The genome-wide identification provided an overall insight of bZIP gene family in wheat and its relatives. The evolutionary relationship of wheat and its relatives was proposed based on orthology analyses. Microarray and expression analyses suggested the potential involvement of bZIP genes in anther development and facilitated selection of anther development related gene for further functional characterization."

"31140145","abstracttext_background","Membrane-bound NADPH oxidases (Nicotinamide adenine ainucleotide phosphate oxidase) also called respiratory burst oxidase homologs (Rboh) play an essential role in ROS production under normal as well as environmental stress conditions in plants."
"31140145","abstracttext_objective","To identify and study respiratory burst homologs (Rboh) from the wheat genome as well as characterize their role in various biological and molecular processes along with expression in response to biotic and abiotic stresses."
"31140145","abstracttext_methods","The Rboh homologs in the wheat genome were predicted based on data processing, alignment of sequences and phylogenetic analysis of sequences in numerous plant species and wheat. The conserved motifs were known followed by domain design study. The 3-D structure prediction and similarity modeling were administered for NADPH enzyme domain. Gene ontology and a functional study were done in addition to expression analysis of Triticum aestivum respiratory burst oxidase (TaRboh) gene family in response to biotic as well as abiotic stress."
"31140145","abstracttext_results","Phylogenetic analysis of Rboh gene family members among seven plant species including wheat, classified the family into four subfamilies. Rboh genes are mainly involved in various biological processes such as Response to oxidative stress, Superoxide anion generation, Hydrogen peroxide biosynthetic process. Among the molecular functions, calcium ion binding, peroxidase activity, oxidoreductase activity, superoxide-generating NADPH oxidase activity are essential. Enzyme annotation of the family and superfamily revealed that it encodes to five structural clusters and coding to enzymes NAD(P)H oxidase (H 2 O 2 -forming) (EC:1.6.3.1), Ferric-chelate reductase (NADH) (EC: 1.16.1.7), Peroxidase (EC: 1.11.1.7), Ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase (EC: 2.7.6.1). The enzymes contain six membrane-spanning domains, two hemes, and conserved motifs associated with NADPH, EF-hand and FAD binding. The outcomes additionally reflect a distinct role of this enzyme in different molecular functions which are responsible for the stress signaling. Further, the transcripts of TaRboh found expressed in various plant parts such as stem, leaves, spike, seed, and roots. We also observed expression of these gene family members under drought/combination of drought + heat and important wheat pathogens such as Puccinia striformis, Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, Fusarium graminiarum, F. pseudograminiarum, and Zymoseptoria tritici."

"29258257","articletitle","AetMYC1, the Candidate Gene Controlling the Red Coleoptile Trait in Aegilops tauschii Coss. Accession As77."
"29258257","abstracttext","The red coleoptile trait can help monocotyledonous plants withstand stresses, and key genes responsible for the trait have been isolated from Triticum aestivum , Triticum urartu , and Triticum monococcum , but no corresponding research has been reported for Aegilops tauschii . In this research, transcriptome analysis was performed to isolate the candidate gene controlling the white coleoptile trait in Ae. tauschii . There were 5348 upregulated, differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) and 4761 downregulated DEGs in red coleoptile vs. white coleoptile plants. Among these DEGs, 12 structural genes and two transcription factors involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were identified. The majority of structural genes showed lower transcript abundance in the white coleoptile of accession 'As77' than in the red coleoptile of accession 'As60', which implied that transcription factors related to anthocyanin biosynthesis could be the candidate genes. The MYB and MYC transcription factors AetMYB7D and AetMYC1 were both isolated from Ae. tauschii accessions 'As60' and 'As77', and their transcript levels analyzed. The coding sequence and transcript level of AetMYB7D showed no difference between 'As60' and 'As77'. AetMYC1p encoded a 567-amino acid polypeptide in 'As60' containing the entire characteristic domains, bHLH-MYC_N, HLH, and ACT-like, belonging to the gene family involved in regulating anthocyanin biosynthesis. AetMYC1w encoded a 436-amino acid polypeptide in 'As77' without the ACT-like domain because a single nucleotide mutation at 1310 bp caused premature termination. Transient expression of AetMYC1p induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in 'As77' with the co-expression of AetMYB7D , while AetMYC1w could not cause induced anthocyanin biosynthesis under the same circumstances. Moreover, the transcript abundance of AetMYC1w was lower than that of AetMYC1p . AetMYC1 appears to be the candidate gene controlling the white coleoptile trait in Ae. tauschii , which can be used for potential biotech applications, such as producing new synthetic hexaploid wheat lines with different coleoptile colors."
"20089768","articletitle","Down-regulation of the CSLF6 gene results in decreased (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan in endosperm of wheat."
"20089768","abstracttext","(1,3;1,4)-beta-d-Glucan (beta-glucan) accounts for 20% of the total cell walls in the starchy endosperm of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and is an important source of dietary fiber for human nutrition with potential health benefits. Bioinformatic and array analyses of gene expression profiles in developing caryopses identified the CELLULOSE SYNTHASE-LIKE F6 (CSLF6) gene as encoding a putative beta-glucan synthase. RNA interference constructs were therefore designed to down-regulate CSLF6 gene expression and expressed in transgenic wheat under the control of a starchy endosperm-specific HMW subunit gene promoter. Analysis of wholemeal flours using an enzyme-based kit and by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography after digestion with lichenase showed decreases in total beta-glucan of between 30% and 52% and between 36% and 53%, respectively, in five transgenic lines compared to three control lines. The content of water-extractable beta-glucan was also reduced by about 50% in the transgenic lines, and the M(r) distribution of the fraction was decreased from an average of 79 to 85 x 10(4) g/mol in the controls and 36 to 57 x 10(4) g/mol in the transgenics. Immunolocalization of beta-glucan in semithin sections of mature and developing grains confirmed that the impact of the transgene was confined to the starchy endosperm with little or no effect on the aleurone or outer layers of the grain. The results confirm that the CSLF6 gene of wheat encodes a beta-glucan synthase and indicate that transgenic manipulation can be used to enhance the health benefits of wheat products."
"27650191","articletitle","The seed dormancy allele TaSdr-A1a associated with pre-harvest sprouting tolerance is mainly present in Chinese wheat landraces."
"27650191","abstracttext_key message","We cloned TaSdr - A1 gene, and developed a gene-specific marker for TaSdr - A1 . A QTL for germination index at the TaSdr - A1 locus was identified in the Yangxiaomai/Zhongyou 9507 RIL population. Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) affects yield and end-use quality in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In the present study we found an association between the TaSdr-A1 gene and PHS tolerance in bread wheat. TaSdr-A1 on chromosome 2A was cloned using a homologous cloning approach. Sequence analysis of TaSdr-A1 revealed an SNP at position 643, with the G allele being present in genotypes with lower germination index (GI) values and A in those with higher GI. These alleles were designated as TaSdr-A1a and TaSdr-A1b, respectively. A cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence (CAPS) marker Sdr2A based on the SNP was developed, and linkage mapping and QTL analysis were conducted to confirm the association between TaSdr-A1 and seed dormancy. Sdr2A was located in a 2.9 cM interval between SSR markers Xgwm95 and Xgwm372. A QTL for GI at the TaSdr-A1 locus explained 6.6, 7.3, and 8.2 % of the phenotypic variances in a Yangxiaomai/Zhongyou 9507 RIL population grown at Beijing, Shijiazhuang, and the averaged data from the two environments, respectively. Two sets of Chinese wheat cultivars used for validating the TaSdr-A1 polymorphism and the corresponding gene-specific marker Sdr2A showed that TaSdr-A1 was significantly associated with GI. Among 29 accessions with TaSdr-A1a, 24 (82.8 %) were landraces, indicating the importance of Chinese wheat landraces as sources of PHS tolerance. This study identified a novel PHS resistance allele TaSdr-A1a mainly presented in Chinese landraces and it is likely to be the causal gene for QPhs.ccsu-2A.3, providing new information for an understanding of seed dormancy."
"11126566","articletitle","New members of a cold-responsive group-3 Lea/Rab-related Cor gene family from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"11126566","abstracttext","A Cor (cold-responsive) cDNA that belongs to the group-3 Lea (late embryogenesis abundant)/Rab (responsive to abscisic acid, ABA) family was isolated from a winter-hardy cultivar of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Screening of a cold-acclimated cDNA library was performed using an ABA- and other stress-responsive barley cDNA clone, Hva1, as a probe. A wheat cDNA clone (designated as Wrab19) putatively encoded a basic (pI = 10.3) and hydrophobic protein with 179 amino acids. The deduced protein showed characteristics of the group-3 LEA/RAB protein family. In contrast to the single copy barley Hva1, Wrab19 belonged to a multigene family in the hexaploid wheat genome and six loci were assigned to the homoeologous group 1 chromosomes. Using Wrab19 as a probe, four homologous cDNAs (designated as Wrab17) were isolated that encoded acidic (pI = 4.6-4.7) and hydrophobic proteins, all with 166 amino acids. The deduced proteins showed high homology (a mean of 84% identity) with a barley gibberellic acid (GA3)-inducible protein, ES2A, and several other group-3 LEA/RAB proteins. Wrab17 was considered to be a three-copy gene and each copy was assigned to chromosome 5A, 4B or 4D of hexaploid wheat. Transcripts of both Wrab19 and Wrab17 accumulated within 1 day of cold acclimation at 4 degrees C. They were responsive to ABA and/or GA3, but showed some cultivar differences in their response to these plant hormones. We conclude that the two genes are new members of the group-3 Lea/Rab-related Cor gene family in wheat."
"18305921","articletitle","Molecular characterization and genomic organization of low molecular weight glutenin subunit genes at the Glu-3 loci in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"18305921","abstracttext","In this study, we report on the molecular characterization and genomic organization of the low molecular weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS) gene family in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Eighty-two positive BAC clones were identified to contain LMW-GS genes from the hexaploid wheat 'Glenlea' BAC library via filter hybridization and PCR validation. Twelve unique LMW glutenin genes and seven pseudogenes were isolated from these positive BAC clones by primer-template mismatch PCR and subsequent primer walking using hemi-nested touchdown PCR. These genes were sequenced and each consisted of a single-open reading frame (ORF) and untranslated 5' and 3' flanking regions. All 12 LMW glutenin subunits contained eight cysteine residues. The LMW-m-type subunits are the most abundant in hexaploid wheat. Of the 12 LMW-GS, 1, 2 and 9 are i-type, s-type and m-type, respectively. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that the LMW-i type gene showed greater differences to LMW-s and LMW-m-type genes, which, in turn, were more closely related to one another. On the basis of their N-terminal sequences, they were classified into nine groups. Fingerprinting of the 82 BAC clones indicated 30 BAC clones assembled into eight contigs, while the remaining clones were singletons. BAC end sequencing of the 82 clones revealed that long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons were abundant in the Glu-3 regions. The average physical distance between two adjacent LMW-GS genes was estimated to be 81 kb. Most of LMW-GS genes are located in the D: -genome, suggesting that the Glu-D3 locus is much larger than the Glu-B3 locus and Glu-A3 locus. Alignments of sequences indicated that the same type (starting with the same N-terminal sequence) LMW-GS genes were highly conserved in the homologous genomes between hexaploid wheat and its donors such as durum wheat and T. tauschii."
"22718510","articletitle","Identification, characterization and mapping of differentially expressed genes in a winter wheat cultivar (Centenaire) resistant to Fusarium graminearum infection."
"22718510","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), predominantly caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a destructive disease that poses a serious threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production around the world. A suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) cDNA library was constructed from F. graminearum infected spikes of a resistant Belgian winter wheat variety Centenaire, exhibiting Type II resistance to FHB. Forty-three differentially expressed transcripts were identified and classified in different categories according to their predicted function, including proteins involved in defense response, signaling, transport of molecules, metabolism and proteins with unknown function. Time-course gene expression analysis between the FHB resistant genotype Centenaire and the susceptible genotype Robigus was carried out on twelve selected genes in order to validate the SSH screening. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction showed that the selected transcripts were differentially expressed between the resistant and the susceptible genotype at three-time points (24, 48 and 72 h) after inoculation with the pathogen, and mostly, the transcripts accumulation rates were higher in the FHB-resistant as compared to the susceptible one. Thirty identified differentially expressed loci were mapped on the corresponding wheat chromosomes either by in silico analysis or by PCR-based mapping strategy, and fifteen of these loci were located within or nearby chromosomal regions known to have quantitative trait loci for FHB resistance in winter wheat cultivars. This work emphasizes the differential gene expression between the FHB-resistant winter wheat Centenaire and the susceptible Robigus and highlights the putative genes and mechanism involved in the disease resistance reaction."
"22643902","articletitle","SNP identification and allelic-specific PCR markers development for TaGW2, a gene linked to wheat kernel weight."
"22643902","abstracttext","TaGW2, an orthologous gene of rice OsGW2, has been associated with kernel width and weight of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Difference in TaGW2 coding sequence was not found among different wheat varieties in previous researches. In this study, we found eight exons and seven introns in TaGW2 with a full-length cDNA sequence of 1,275 bp, which contains a conserved function domain and seven splice sites that shared homology with rice OsGW2. A single T-base insertion in the eighth exon of TaGW2 on chromosome 6A was detected in a large-kernel wheat variety, Lankaodali. This insertion mutation reduces the coding protein sequence from normal 424 amino acids (~47.2 kDa) to 328 amino acids (~37.1 kDa) by truncating 96 amino acids. The result was validated by identifying histidine-tagged TaGW2 proteins encoded by both alleles of the mutant and the wild types in SDS-PAGE. Allele-specific PCR markers were developed based on the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) site. The SNP markers were genotyped for an F(2) segregation population from the cross of Lankaodali × Chinese Spring. Seed traits of F(2:3) families were evaluated in three different environments. The association analysis indicated that F(2:3) families with the mutated TaGW2 allele significantly increased kernel width (KW) and thousand-kernel weight (TKW), and slightly improved kernel length (KL). Using the SNP markers, another two varieties harbored the mutated TaGW2 allele were successfully identified from 22 additional wheat varieties, and they both have large KW and TKW. Cloning and sequencing of the gene further confirmed the functions of the mutated allele of TaGW2 in the two large kernel varieties. The results suggested that TaGW2 may negatively regulate kernel size variation, which shares the same function as OsGW2 in rice. The successful development of SNP markers provides a useful tool for improving kernel yield in wheat."
"20965441","articletitle","A novel Ta.AGP.S.1b transcript in Chinese common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"20965441","abstracttext","ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), the key enzyme of starch synthesis in plants, is composed of two small and two large subunits, and has plastidial and cytosolic isoforms. In kernels of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), transcripts for cytosolic (Ta.AGP.S1a) and plastidial (Ta.AGP.S1b) small subunits of AGPase were encoded by the same gene (Ta.AGP.S.1) by use of the alternative first exons. In this study, a cDNA sequence (1631 bp) [NCBI: EU586278] encoding a novel Ta.AGP.S1b transcript was isolated in kernels of Chinese common wheat cultivars. Compared with another Ta.AGP.S1b transcript [NCBI: FJ643609] isolated in kernels of non-Chinese wheat cultivars, EU586278 lacked a long fragment (117 bp) at its 5'terminal, resulting in a shorten transit peptide. The lacked fragments of Ta.AGP.S1b (EU586278) were universally found in surveyed 22 Chinese common wheat cultivars. Partial genomic DNA sequence [NCBI: FJ907395] of Ta.AGP.S.1 gene, which was corresponded to 5'terminal of EU586278 transcript, was also isolated in Chinese common cultivars and sequencing indicated that FJ907395 contained the corresponding lacked fragment of EU586278 transcript, inferring the lacked fragment in EU586278 transcript was not present in the genome, but possibly occurred at transcription level. Using TargetP software, the predicated transit peptide of putative plastidial SSU encoded by EU586278 contained merely 25 amino acids, considerably shorter than those of other plant AGP. S.1bs (54-70 amino acids). Phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that the amino acid sequence of EU586278 transit peptide was not clustered together with those of other wheat Ta.AGP.S1bs [NCBI: AF536819 and FJ643609] and barley AGP.S1b [NCBI: Z48563]. These implied that EU586278 could be a novel Ta.AGP.S1b transcript. Semi-quantitative PCR analysis indicated that transcripts of EU586278 were abundantly expressed in leaf, moderately in endosperm and stem, and weakly in root."

"21327447","abstracttext","Nuclear factor Y (NF-Y) transcription factor is a heterotrimer comprised of three subunits: NF-YA, NF-YB and NF-YC. Each of the three subunits in plants is encoded by multiple genes with differential expression profiles, implying the functional specialisation of NF-Y subunit members in plants. In this study, we investigated the roles of NF-YB members in the light-mediated regulation of photosynthesis genes. We identified two NF-YB members from Triticum aestivum (TaNF-YB3 & 7) which were markedly upregulated by light in the leaves and seedling shoots using quantitative RT-PCR. A genome-wide coexpression analysis of multiple Affymetrix Wheat Genome Array datasets revealed that TaNF-YB3-coexpressed transcripts were highly enriched with the Gene Ontology term photosynthesis. Transgenic wheat lines constitutively overexpressing TaNF-YB3 had a significant increase in the leaf chlorophyll content, photosynthesis rate and early growth rate. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that the expression levels of a number of TaNF-YB3-coexpressed transcripts were elevated in the transgenic wheat lines. The mRNA level of TaGluTR encoding glutamyl-tRNA reductase, which catalyses the rate-limiting step of the chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway, was significantly increased in the leaves of the transgenic wheat. Significant increases in the expression level in the transgenic plant leaves were also observed for four photosynthetic apparatus genes encoding chlorophyll a/b-binding proteins (Lhca4 and Lhcb4) and photosystem I reaction centre subunits (subunit K and subunit N), as well as for a gene coding for chloroplast ATP synthase γ subunit. These results indicate that TaNF-YB3 is involved in the positive regulation of a number of photosynthesis genes in wheat."

"24344140","abstracttext_background and aims","The ω-gliadin storage proteins of wheat are of interest in relation to their impact on grain processing properties and their role in food allergy, particularly the ω-5 sub-group and wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis. The ω-gliadins are also known to be responsive to nitrogen application. This study therefore compares the effects of cultivar and nitrogen availability on the synthesis and deposition of ω-gliadins in wheat grown under field conditions in the UK, including temporal and spatial analyses at the protein and transcript levels."
"24344140","abstracttext_methods","SDS-PAGE, western blotting and N-terminal amino acid sequencing were used to compare the patterns of ω-gliadin components in mature grain of six British wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars and their accumulation during the development of grain grown in field plots with varying nitrogen supply.

"26334547","abstracttext_key message","By using 2V-specific EST-PCR markers and sequential GISH/FISH analysis, we identified four homozygous CS-2V translocation lines, including a novel compensating T2VS·2DL translocation line NAU422. This translocation line has longer spikes and produces more grains per spike than its recurrent parent CS and three other translocation lines, which could be a valuable resource in wheat yield improvement. Dasypyrum villosum (2n = 14, VV), the wild relative of wheat, possesses novel and superior alleles at many important loci and should be utilized to improve the genetic diversity of cultivated wheat and may be very helpful for the improvement of wheat yield. In this study, four homozygous Chinese Spring (CS)-D. villosum translocation lines containing different fragments of chromosome 2V were characterized from a pool, including 76 translocations that occur in chromosomes 1 V through 7 V of D. villosum by both molecular markers and cytogenetic analysis. A rough physical map of 2V was developed which included nine markers in three segments of the short arm and ten markers in the long arm. The photoperiod response gene of D. villosum (Ppd-V1) was physically mapped to the FL 0.33-0.53 region of 2VS, while the gene controlling bristles on the glume ridges (Bgr-V1) was mapped to 2VS FL 0.00-0.33. A novel compensating Triticum aestivum-D. villosum Robertsonian translocation line T2VS·2DL (NAU422) with good plant vigor and full fertility was further characterized by sequential genomic in situ hybridization and fluorescent in situ hybridization and the use of molecular markers. Compared to its recurrent parent CS and three other translocation lines, the T2VS·2DL translocation line has longer spikes, more spikelets and more grains per spike in two season years, which suggested that the alien segment may carry yield-related genes of D. villosum. The developed T2VS·2DL translocation line with its morphological and co-dominant molecular markers could be utilized as a novel germplasm for high-yield wheat breeding."

"26714310","abstracttext","Stripe rust is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Adult-plant resistance (APR) is an efficient approach to provide long-term protection of wheat from the disease. The Chinese winter wheat cultivar Zhong 892 has a moderate level of APR to stripe rust in the field. To determine the inheritance of the APR resistance in this cultivar, 273 F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from a cross between Linmai 2 and Zhong 892. The RILs were evaluated for maximum disease severity (MDS) in two sites during the 2011-2012, 2012-2013 and 2013-2014 cropping seasons, providing data for five environments. Illumina 90k SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) chips were used to genotype the RILs and their parents. Composite interval mapping (CIM) detected eight QTL, namely QYr.caas-2AL, QYr.caas-2BL.3, QYr.caas-3AS, QYr.caas-3BS, QYr.caas-5DL, QYr.caas-6AL, QYr.caas-7AL and QYr.caas-7DS.1, respectively. All except QYr.caas-2BL.3 resistance alleles were contributed by Zhong 892. QYr.caas-3AS and QYr.caas-3BS conferred stable resistance to stripe rust in all environments, explaining 6.2-17.4% and 5.0-11.5% of the phenotypic variances, respectively. The genome scan of SNP sequences tightly linked to QTL for APR against annotated proteins in wheat and related cereals genomes identified two candidate genes (autophagy-related gene and disease resistance gene RGA1), significantly associated with stripe rust resistance. These QTL and their closely linked SNP markers, in combination with kompetitive allele specific PCR (KASP) technology, are potentially useful for improving stripe rust resistances in wheat breeding."

Despite several studies on WRKYs in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), functional annotation information about wheat WRKYs is limited."
"28484671","abstracttext_results","Here, 171 TaWRKY TFs were identified from the whole wheat genome and compared with proteins from 19 other species representing nine major plant lineages. A phylogenetic analysis, coupled with gene structure analysis and motif determination, divided these TaWRKYs into seven subgroups (Group I, IIa-e, and III). Chromosomal location showed that most TaWRKY genes were enriched on four chromosomes, especially on chromosome 3B. In addition, 85 (49.7%) genes were either tandem (5) or segmental duplication (80), which suggested that though tandem duplication has contributed to the expansion of TaWRKY family, segmental duplication probably played a more pivotal role. Analysis of cis -acting elements revealed putative functions of WRKYs in wheat during development as well as under numerous biotic and abiotic stresses. Finally, the expression of TaWRKY genes in flag leaves, glumes, and lemmas under water-deficit condition were analyzed. Results showed that different TaWRKY genes preferentially express in specific tissue during the grain-filling stage."

"27659842","articletitle","Characterization of Lr75: a partial, broad-spectrum leaf rust resistance gene in wheat."
"27659842","abstracttext_key message","Here, we describe a strategy to improve broad-spectrum leaf rust resistance by marker-assisted combination of two partial resistance genes. One of them represents a novel partial adult plant resistance gene, named Lr75. Leaf rust caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia triticina is a damaging disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The combination of several, additively-acting partial disease resistance genes has been proposed as a suitable strategy to breed wheat cultivars with high levels of durable field resistance. The Swiss winter wheat cultivar 'Forno' continues to show near-immunity to leaf rust since its release in the 1980s. This resistance is conferred by the presence of at least six quantitative trait loci (QTL), one of which is associated with the morphological trait leaf tip necrosis. Here, we used a marker-informed strategy to introgress two 'Forno' QTLs into the leaf rust-susceptible Swiss winter wheat cultivar 'Arina'. The resulting backcross line 'ArinaLrFor' showed markedly increased leaf rust resistance in multiple locations over several years. One of the introgressed QTLs, QLr.sfr-1BS, is located on chromosome 1BS. We developed chromosome 1B-specific microsatellite markers by exploiting the Illumina survey sequences of wheat cv. 'Chinese Spring' and mapped QLr.sfr-1BS to a 4.3 cM interval flanked by the SSR markers gwm604 and swm271. QLr.sfr-1BS does not share a genetic location with any of the described leaf rust resistance genes present on chromosome 1B. Therefore, QLr.sfr-1BS is novel and was designated as Lr75. We conclude that marker-assisted combination of partial resistance genes is a feasible strategy to increase broad-spectrum leaf rust resistance. The identification of Lr75 adds a novel and highly useful gene to the small set of known partial, adult plant leaf rust resistance genes."

"29380071","abstracttext","Drought frequently occurs during wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain filling. The objectives of this study were (i) to investigate the effect of post-anthesis drought on programmed cell death (PCD) in wheat endosperm cells and (ii) to examine the role of ethylene (ETH) receptors and abscisic acid (ABA) in regulating wheat endosperm PCD. Two winter wheat cultivars ('Xindong 18' and 'Xindong 22') were used in this study. Grain samples were collected from normal and drought stressed plants at 5-day intervals between 5 and 35 days post-anthesis. The samples were then compared with respect to cell viability, nuclear morphometry, cell ultrastructure, DNA integrity, nucleic acid content, and nuclease activity. Analysis was also conducted about gene transcripts related to PCD, ETH receptors, and ABA biosynthesis and degradation. Drought stress reduced cell viability, accelerated nuclear deformation, and increased mitochondrial dissolution. The activity of nucleic acid hydrolase was greater, and the nucleic acid concentrations were less in the drought treatments than in the control. As a result, the peak in DNA fragmentation occurred earlier in the drought treatment. Drought stress significantly increased the expression of four genes related to ABA (nced1, nced2, ao1, ao2). In contrast, drought significantly reduced the expression of four genes related to ETH receptors (ers1, ers2 etr1, etr2) and one gene related to PCD (dad1). In summary, the results indicated that drought stress caused PCD to occur earlier in the endosperm of winter wheat."
"28197152","articletitle","Comparative Analysis of WRKY Genes Potentially Involved in Salt Stress Responses in Triticum turgidum L . ssp. durum ."
"28197152","abstracttext","WRKY transcription factors are involved in multiple aspects of plant growth, development and responses to biotic stresses. Although they have been found to play roles in regulating plant responses to environmental stresses, these roles still need to be explored, especially those pertaining to crops. Durum wheat is the second most widely produced cereal in the world. Complex, large and unsequenced genomes, in addition to a lack of genomic resources, hinder the molecular characterization of tolerance mechanisms. This paper describes the isolation and characterization of five TdWRKY genes from durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum L . ssp. durum ). A PCR-based screening of a T. turgidum BAC genomic library using primers within the conserved region of WRKY genes resulted in the isolation of five BAC clones. Following sequencing fully the five BACs, fine annotation through Triannot pipeline revealed 74.6% of the entire sequences as transposable elements and a 3.2% gene content with genes organized as islands within oceans of TEs. Each BAC clone harbored a TdWRKY gene. The study showed a very extensive conservation of genomic structure between TdWRKYs and their orthologs from Brachypodium, barley, and T. aestivum . The structural features of TdWRKY proteins suggested that they are novel members of the WRKY family in durum wheat. TdWRKY1/2/4, TdWRKY3, and TdWRKY5 belong to the group Ia, IIa, and IIc, respectively. Enrichment of cis -regulatory elements related to stress responses in the promoters of some TdWRKY genes indicated their potential roles in mediating plant responses to a wide variety of environmental stresses. TdWRKY genes displayed different expression patterns in response to salt stress that distinguishes two durum wheat genotypes with contrasting salt stress tolerance phenotypes. TdWRKY genes tended to react earlier with a down-regulation in sensitive genotype leaves and with an up-regulation in tolerant genotype leaves. The TdWRKY transcripts levels in roots increased in tolerant genotype compared to sensitive genotype. The present results indicate that these genes might play some functional role in the salt tolerance in durum wheat."

"29570880","abstracttext","GW2 is emerging as a key genetic determinant of grain weight in cereal crops; it has three homoeologs (TaGW2-A1, -B1 and -D1) in hexaploid common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Here, by analyzing the gene editing mutants that lack one (B1 or D1), two (B1 and D1) or all three (A1, B1 and D1) homoeologs of TaGW2, several insights are gained into the functions of TaGW2-B1 and -D1 in common wheat grain traits. First, both TaGW2-B1 and -D1 affect thousand-grain weight (TGW) by influencing grain width and length, but the effect conferred by TaGW2-B1 is stronger than that of TaGW2-D1. Second, there exists functional interaction between TaGW2 homoeologs because the TGW increase shown by a double mutant (lacking B1 and D1) was substantially larger than that of their single mutants. Third, both TaGW2-B1 and -D1 modulate cell number and length in the outer pericarp of developing grains, with TaGW2-B1 being more potent. Finally, TaGW2 homoeologs also affect grain protein content as this parameter was generally increased in the mutants, especially in the lines lacking two or three homoeologs. Consistent with this finding, two wheat end-use quality-related parameters, flour protein content and gluten strength, were considerably elevated in the mutants. Collectively, our data shed light on functional difference between and additive interaction of TaGW2 homoeologs in the genetic control of grain weight and protein content traits in common wheat, which may accelerate further research on this important gene and its application in wheat improvement."

"28856651","abstracttext","Stem rust (SR) or black rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici is one of the most common diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops globally. Among the various control measures, the most efficient and sustainable approach is the deployment of genetically resistant cultivars. Traditionally, wheat breeding programs deployed genetic resistance in cultivars, but unknowingly this is often underpinned by a single seedling resistance gene, which is readily overcome by the pathogen. Nowadays, adult plant resistance (APR) is a widely adopted form of rust resistance because more durable mechanisms often underpin it. However, only a handful of SR APR genes are available, so breeders currently strive to combine seedling and APR genes. Phenotyping adult wheat plants for resistance to SR typically involves evaluation in the field. But establishing a rust nursery can be challenging, and screening is limited to once a year. This slows down research efforts to isolate new APR genes and breeding of genetically resistant cultivars.In this study, we report a protocol for rapid evaluation of adult wheat plants for resistance to stem rust. We demonstrate the technique by evaluating a panel of 16 wheat genotypes consisting of near isogenic lines (NILs) for known Sr genes (i.e., Sr2, Sr33, Sr45, Sr50, Sr55, Sr57, and Sr58) and three landraces carrying uncharacterized APR from the N. I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources (VIR). The method can be completed in just 10 weeks and involves two inoculations: first conducted at seedling stage and a second at the adult stage (using the same plants). The technique can detect APR, such as that conferred by APR gene Sr2, along with pseudo-black chaff (the morphological marker). Phenotyping can be conducted throughout the year, and is fast and resource efficient. Further, the phenotyping method can be applied to screen breeding populations or germplasm accessions using local or exotic races of SR."

"30873195","abstracttext","Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important crops in the world. Squamosa promoter binding protein-like (SPL) proteins are plant-specific transcript factors and play critical roles in plant growth and development. The functions of many SPL gene family members were well characterized in Arabidopsis and rice, in contrast, research on wheat SPL genes is lagging behind. In this study, we cloned and characterized TaSPL16 , an orthologous gene of rice OsSPL16 , in wheat. Three TaSPL16 homoeologs are located on the short arms of chromosome 7A, 7B, and 7D, and share more than 96% sequence identity with each other. All the TaSPL16 homoeologs have three exons and two introns, with a miR156 binding site in their last exons. They encode putative proteins of 407, 409, and 414 amino acid residues, respectively. Subcellular localization showed TaSPL16 distribution in the cell nucleus, and transcription activity of TaSPL16 was validated in yeast. Analysis of the spatiotemporal expression profile showed that TaSPL16 is highly expressed in young developing panicles, lowly expressed in developing seeds and almost undetectable in vegetative tissues. Ectopic expression of TaSPL16 in Arabidopsis causes a delay in the emergence of vegetative leaves (3-4 days late), promotes early flowering (5-7 days early), increases organ size, and affects yield-related traits. These results demonstrated the regulatory roles of TaSPL16 in plant growth and development as well as seed yield. Our findings enrich the existing knowledge on SPL genes in wheat and provide valuable information for further investigating the effects of TaSPL16 on plant architecture and yield-related traits of wheat."

Disease-resistant wheat varieties offer farmers one of the most effective ways to manage these diseases. The common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) Arableu#1, developed by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center and released as Deka in Ethiopia, shows susceptibility to both LR and YR at the seedling stage but a high level of adult plant resistance (APR) to the diseases in the field. We used 142 F 5 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Apav#1 × Arableu#1 to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for APR to LR and YR. A total of 4,298 genotyping-by-sequencing markers were used to construct a genetic linkage map. The study identified four LR resistance QTLs and six YR resistance QTLs in the population. Among these, QLr.cim-1BL.1/QYr.cim-1BL.1 was located in the same location as Lr46/Yr29 , a known pleiotropic resistance gene. QLr.cim-1BL.2 and QYr.cim-1BL.2 were also located on wheat chromosome 1BL at 37 cM from Lr46/Yr29 and may represent a new segment for pleiotropic resistance to both rusts. QLr.cim-7BL is likely Lr68 given its association with the tightly linked molecular marker cs7BLNLRR . In addition, QLr.cim-3DS , QYr.cim-2AL , QYr.cim-4BL , QYr.cim-5AL , and QYr.cim-7DS are probably new resistance loci based on comparisons with published QTLs for resistance to LR and YR.

Among them, 273 QTLs were delimited to ≤1.0-Mb intervals and 7 of them are either known genes (Rht-D, Vrn-B1, and Vrn-D1) that have been cloned or known QTLs (TaGA2ox8, APO1, TaSus1-7B, and Rht12) that were previously mapped. Eight putative candidate genes were identified for three QTLs that enhance spike seed setting and grain size using gene expression data and were validated in three bi-parental populations. Protein sequence analysis identified 33 putative wheat orthologs that have high identity with rice genes in QTLs affecting similar traits. Large r 2 values for additive effects observed among the QTLs for most traits indicated that the phenotypes of these identified QTLs were highly predictable. Results from this study demonstrated that significantly increasing GWAS population size and marker density greatly improves detection and identification of candidate genes underlying a QTL, solidifying the foundation for large-scale QTL fine mapping, candidate gene validation, and developing functional markers for genomics-based breeding in wheat."

"30150615","abstracttext","Crop diseases reduce wheat yields by ~25% globally and thus pose a major threat to global food security 1 . Genetic resistance can reduce crop losses in the field and can be selected through the use of molecular markers. However, genetic resistance often breaks down following changes in pathogen virulence, as experienced with the wheat yellow (stripe) rust fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst) 2 . This highlights the need to (1) identify genes that, alone or in combination, provide broad-spectrum resistance, and (2) increase our understanding of the underlying molecular modes of action. Here we report the isolation and characterization of three major yellow rust resistance genes (Yr7, Yr5 and YrSP) from hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), each having a distinct recognition specificity. We show that Yr5, which remains effective to a broad range of Pst isolates worldwide, is closely related yet distinct from Yr7, whereas YrSP is a truncated version of Yr5 with 99.8% sequence identity. All three Yr genes belong to a complex resistance gene cluster on chromosome 2B encoding nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs) with a non-canonical N-terminal zinc-finger BED domain 3 that is distinct from those found in non-NLR wheat proteins. We developed diagnostic markers to accelerate haplotype analysis and for marker-assisted selection to expedite the stacking of the non-allelic Yr genes. Our results provide evidence that the BED-NLR gene architecture can provide effective field-based resistance to important fungal diseases such as wheat yellow rust."

Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as one of the world's staple crops is highly sensitive to heat stress, which can adversely affect both yield and quality. Plant heat shock factors (Hsfs) play a crucial role in abiotic and biotic stress response and conferring stress tolerance. Thus, multifunctional Hsfs may be potentially targets in generating novel strains that have the ability to survive environments that feature a combination of stresses."
"30935363","abstracttext_result","In this study, using the released genome sequence of wheat and the novel Hsf protein HMM (Hidden Markov Model) model constructed with the Hsf protein sequence of model monocot (Oryza sativa) and dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) plants, genome-wide TaHsfs identification was performed. Eighty-two non-redundant and full-length TaHsfs were randomly located on 21 chromosomes. The structural characteristics and phylogenetic analysis with Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa and Zea mays were used to classify these genes into three major classes and further into 13 subclasses. A novel subclass, TaHsfC3 was found which had not been documented in wheat or other plants, and did not show any orthologous genes in A. thaliana, O. sativa, or Z. mays Hsf families. The observation of a high proportion of homeologous TaHsf gene groups suggests that the allopolyploid process, which occurred after the fusion of genomes, contributed to the expansion of the TaHsf family. Furthermore, TaHsfs expression profiling by RNA-seq revealed that the TaHsfs could be responsive not only to abiotic stresses but also to phytohormones. Additionally, the TaHsf family genes exhibited class-, subclass- and organ-specific expression patterns in response to various treatments."

"30690533","abstracttext","The English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), is a cosmopolitan insect pest on cereals. Many studies on life-history traits indicate that S. avenae clones from different areas have diverged on various host plants. However, direct genetic evidence for this phenomenon is rare. Thus, S. avenae clones were collected from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in four provinces (i.e., Hubei, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang) of China, and characterized using six microsatellite markers. In total, 92 multilocus genotypes were found from 302 individuals of S. avenae. Population Jiangsu was found to have relatively high levels of genotypic diversity among the four geographical populations. Substantial long-distance migration of S. avenae was found from Zhejiang to the other three provinces. Thus, relatively low genetic differentiation was found between these geographic populations. Barley clones of S. avenae showed higher gene diversity compared with wheat clones. The gene flow from barley to wheat clones appeared to be more likely than that in the reverse direction. Diversity indices and structure for S. avenae clones suggested highest level of genetic divergence between barley and wheat clones in Jiangsu among all sampling locations. Besides Jiangsu, pairwise FST values indicated moderate levels of genetic divergence between barley and wheat clones in Zhejiang. Thus, compared with geographical factors, plant factors could be relatively more important in promoting genetic differentiation in S. avenae. Our results provide insights into genetic differentiation of S. avenae on different plants, as well as a basis for exploring the molecular mechanism for its differentiation on plants and biotype development."

To better understand the genetic basis and relationships of adaptation and yield related traits, we used a collection of 102 Argentinean hexaploid wheat cultivars genotyped with the 35k SNPs array, grown from two to six years in three different locations. Based on SNPs data and gene-related molecular markers, we performed a haplotype block characterization of the germplasm and a genome-wide association study (GWAS)."

Based on GWAS we identified ninety-seven chromosome regions associated with heading date, plant height, thousand grain weight, grain number per spike and fruiting efficiency at harvest (FEh). In particular FEh stands out as a promising trait to raise yield potential in Argentinean wheats; we detected fifteen haplotypes/markers associated with increased FEh values, eleven of which showed significant effects in all three evaluated locations.

"32695124","abstracttext","Rac/Rop proteins play important roles in the regulation of cell growth and plant defense responses. However, the function of Rac/Rop proteins in wheat remains largely unknown. In this study, a small G protein gene, designated as TaRac6 , was characterized from wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) in response to Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ) and was found to be highly homologous to the Rac proteins identified in other plant species. Transient expression analyses of the TaRac6-GFP fusion protein in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves showed that TaRac6 was localized in the whole cell. Furthermore, transient expression of TaRac6 inhibited Bax-triggered plant cell death (PCD) in N. benthamiana . Transcript accumulation of TaRac6 was increased at 24 h post-inoculation (hpi) in the compatible interaction between wheat and Pst , while it was not induced in an incompatible interaction. More importantly, silencing of TaRac6 by virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) enhanced the resistance of wheat (Suwon 11) to Pst (CYR31) by producing fewer uredinia. Histological observations revealed that the hypha growth of Pst was markedly inhibited along with more H 2 O 2 generated in the TaRac6 -silenced leaves in response to Pst . Moreover, transcript levels of TaCAT were significantly down-regulated, while those of TaSOD and TaNOX were significantly up-regulated. These results suggest that TaRac6 functions as a potential susceptibility factor, which negatively regulate the reactive oxygen species (ROS) burst in the wheat- Pst interaction."

"20431086","abstracttext","In temperate cereals, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), the transition to reproductive development can be accelerated by prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization). We examined the role of the grass-specific MADS box gene ODDSOC2 (OS2) in the vernalization response in cereals. The barley OS2 gene (HvOS2) is expressed in leaves and shoot apices but is repressed by vernalization. Vernalization represses OS2 independently of VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) in a VRN1 deletion mutant of einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum), but VRN1 is required to maintain down-regulation of OS2 in vernalized plants. Furthermore, barleys that carry active alleles of the VRN1 gene (HvVRN1) have reduced expression of HvOS2, suggesting that HvVRN1 down-regulates HvOS2 during development. Overexpression of HvOS2 delayed flowering and reduced spike, stem, and leaf length in transgenic barley plants. Plants overexpressing HvOS2 showed reduced expression of barley homologs of the Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) gene FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (FPF1) and increased expression of RNase-S-like genes. FPF1 promotes floral development and enhances cell elongation, so down-regulation of FPF1-like genes might explain the phenotypes of HvOS2 overexpression lines. We present an extended model of the genetic pathways controlling vernalization-induced flowering in cereals, which describes the regulatory relationships between VRN1, OS2, and FPF1-like genes. Overall, these findings highlight differences and similarities between the vernalization responses of temperate cereals and the model plant Arabidopsis."

"23272050","abstracttext","Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play broad biological roles in plants. We report on a conserved receptor-like protein kinase (RPK) gene from wheat and other Triticeae species. The TaRPK1 was isolated from the Triticum aestivum cv. Prins - Triticum timopheevii introgression line IGVI-465 carrying the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm6. The TaRPK1 was mapped to homoeologous chromosomes 2A (TaRPK1-2A), 2D (TaRPK1-2D) and the Pm6-carrier chromosome 2G (TaRPK1-2G) of IGVI-465. Under the tested conditions, only the TaRPK1-2G allele was actively transcribed, producing two distinct transcripts via alternative splicing. The predicted 424-amino acid protein of TaRPK1-2G contained a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain and an intracellular serine/threonine kinase domain, but lacked a typical extracellular domain. The expression of TaRPK1-2G gene was up-regulated upon the infection by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt) and treatment with methyl jasmonate (MeJA), but down-regulated in response to treatments of SA and ABA. Over-expression of TaRPK1-2G in the powdery mildew susceptible wheat variety Prins by a transient expression assay showed that it slightly reduced the haustorium index of the infected Bgt. These data indicated that TaRPK1-2G participated in the defense response to Bgt infection and in the JA signaling pathway. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaRPK1-2G was highly conserved among plant species, and the amino acid sequence similarity of TaRPK1-2G among grass species was more than 86%. Based on its conservation, the RPK gene-based STS primers were designed, and used to amplify the RPK orthologs from the homoeologous group-2 chromosomes of all the tested Triticeae species, such as chromosome 2G of T. timopheevii, 2R of Secale cereale, 2H of Hordeum vulgare, 2S of Aegilops speltoides, 2S(l) of Ae. longissima, 2M(g) of Ae. geniculata, 2S(p) and 2U(p) of Ae. peregrina. The developed STS markers serve as conserved functional markers for the identification of homoeologous group-2 chromosomes of the Triticeae species."
"21692645","articletitle","Genetic differentiation at microsatellite loci among populations of Mycosphaerella graminicola from California, Indiana, Kansas, and North Dakota."
"21692645","abstracttext","Mycosphaerella graminicola causes Septoria tritici blotch (STB) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and is considered one of the most devastating pathogens of that crop in the United States. Although the genetic structures of M. graminicola populations from different countries have been analyzed using various molecular markers, relatively little is known about M. graminicola populations from geographically distinct areas of the United States and, in particular, of those from spring versus winter wheat. These are exposed to great differences in environmental conditions, length and season of host-free periods, and resistance sources used in geographically separated wheat breeding programs. Thus, there is more likely to be genetic differentiation between populations from spring versus winter wheat than there is among those within each region. To test this hypothesis, 330 single-spore isolates of M. graminicola representing 11 populations (1 from facultative winter wheat in California, 2 from spring wheat in North Dakota, and 8 from winter wheat in Indiana and Kansas) were analyzed for mating type frequency and for genetic variation at 17 microsatellite or simple-sequence repeat (SSR) loci. Analysis of clone-corrected data revealed an equal distribution of both mating types in the populations from Kansas, Indiana, and North Dakota, but a deviation from a 1:1 ratio in the California population. In total, 306 haplotypes were detected, almost all of which were unique in all 11 populations. High levels of gene diversity (H = 0.31 to 0.56) were observed within the 11 populations. Significant (P ≤ 0.05) gametic disequilibrium, as measured by the index of association (rBarD), was observed in California, one Indiana population (IN1), and three populations (KS1, KS2, and KS3) in Kansas that could not be explained by linkage. Corrected standardized fixation index (G″(ST)) values were 0.000 to 0.621 between the 11 populations and the majority of pairwise comparisons were statistically significant (P ≤ 0.001), suggesting some differentiation between populations. Analysis of molecular variance showed that there was a small but statistically significant level of genetic differentiation between populations from spring versus winter wheat. However, most of the total genetic variation (>98%) occurred within spring and winter wheat regions while <2% was due to genetic differentiation between these regions. Taken together, these results provide evidence that sexual recombination occurs frequently in the M. graminicola populations sampled and that most populations are genetically differentiated over the major spring- and winter-wheat-growing regions of the United States."
"27458461","articletitle","Systematic Investigation of FLOWERING LOCUS T-Like Poaceae Gene Families Identifies the Short-Day Expressed Flowering Pathway Gene, TaFT3 in Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"27458461","abstracttext","To date, a small number of major flowering time loci have been identified in the related Triticeae crops, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), durum wheat (T. durum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Natural genetic variants at these loci result in major phenotypic changes which have adapted crops to the novel environments encountered during the spread of agriculture. The polyploid nature of bread and durum wheat means that major flowering time loci in which recessive alleles confer adaptive advantage in related diploid species have not been readily identified. One such example is the PPD-H2 flowering time locus encoded by FLOWERING LOCUS T 3 (HvFT3) in the diploid crop barley, for which recessive mutant alleles confer delayed flowering under short day (SD) photoperiods. In autumn-sown barley, such alleles aid the repression of flowering over the winter, which help prevent the development of cold-sensitive floral organs until the onset of inductive long day (LD) photoperiods the following spring. While the identification of orthologous loci in wheat could provide breeders with alternative mechanisms to fine tune flowering time, systematic identification of wheat orthologs of HvFT3 has not been reported. Here, we characterize the FT gene families in six Poaceae species, identifying novel members in all taxa investigated, as well as FT3 homoeologs from the A, B and D genomes of hexaploid (TaFT3) and tetraploid wheat. Sequence analysis shows TaFT3 homoeologs display high similarity to the HvFT3 coding region (95-96%) and predicted protein (96-97%), with conservation of intron/exon structure across the five cereal species investigated. Genetic mapping and comparative analyses in hexaploid and tetraploid wheat find TaFT3 homoeologs map to the long arms of the group 1 chromosomes, collinear to HvFT3 in barley and FT3 orthologs in rice, foxtail millet and brachypodium. Genome-specific expression analyses show FT3 homoeologs in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat are upregulated under SD photoperiods, but not under LDs, analogous to the expression of HvFT3. Collectively, these results indicate that functional wheat orthologs of HvFT3 have been identified. The molecular resources generated here provide the foundation for engineering a novel major flowering time locus in wheat using forward or reverse genetics approaches."
"17985111","articletitle","Evolutionary origin of the segmental duplication encompassing the wheat GLU-B1 locus encoding the overexpressed Bx7 (Bx7OE) high molecular weight glutenin subunit."
"17985111","abstracttext","Sequencing of a BAC clone encompassing the Glu-B1 locus in Glenlea, revealed a 10.3 Kb segmental duplication including the Bx7 gene and flanking an LTR retroelement. To better understand the evolution of this locus, two collections of wheat were surveyed. The first consisted of 96 diploid and tetraploid species accessions while the second consisted of 316 Triticum aestivum cultivars and landraces from 41 countries. The genotypes were first characterized by SDS-PAGE and a total of 40 of the 316 T. aestivum accessions were found to display the overexpressed Bx7 phenotype (Bx7OE). Three lines from the 96 diploid/tetraploid collection also displayed the stronger intensity staining characteristic of the Bx7(OE) subunit. The relative amounts of the Bx7 subunit to total HMW-GS were quantified by RP-HPLC for all Bx7OE accessions and a number of checks. The entire collection was assessed for the presence of four DNA markers namely an 18 bp indel of the coding region of Bx7 variant alleles, a 43 bp indel of the 5'-region and the left and right junctions of the LTR retrotransposon borders and the duplicated segment. All 43 accessions found to have the Bx7OE subunit by SDS-PAGE and RP-HPLC produced the four diagnostic PCR amplicons. None of the lines without the Bx7OE had the LTR retroelement/duplication genomic structure. However, the 18 and 43 bp indel were found in accessions other than Bx7OE. These results indicate that the overexpression of the Bx7 HMW-GS is likely the result of a single event, i.e., a gene duplication at the Glu-B1 locus mediated by the insertion of a retroelement. Also, the 18 and 43 bp indels pre-date the duplication event. Allelic variants Bx7*, Bx7 with and without 43 bp insert and Bx7OE were found in both tetraploid and hexaploid collections and shared the same genomic organization. Though the possibility of introgression from T. aestivum to T. turgidum cannot be ruled out, the three structural genomic changes of the B-genome taken together support the hypothesis of multiple polyploidization events involving different tetraploid progenitors."

"27111449","abstracttext","Lectin receptor kinases (LRKs) play a critical role in plants during development and stress conditions, but a comprehensive analysis at genome level is still not carried out in Triticum aestivum. Herein, we performed the genome wide identification, characterization and expression analysis of these genes in T. aestivum (TaLRK). In-total 263 TaLRK genes were identified, which were further classified into three groups based on the nature of lectin domain. We identified, two TaLRKs consisted of calcium-dependent lectin (C-LRK), while 84 legume-lectin (L-LRK) and 177 bulb-lectin (B-LRK) domains. The L-LRK and B-LRK genes were distributed throughout the genome of T. aestivum. Most of the TaLRKs were clustered as homologs, which were distributed either in proximity on same chromosome or on homoeologous chromosomes of A, B and D sub-genomes. A total of 9 and 58 duplication events were also predicted in L-LRK and B-LRK, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated conserved evolutionary relationship of homologous and orthologous genes from multiple plant species. Gene ontology analysis indicated TaLRKs role in binding, signaling and receptor activities. Most of the TaLRKs consisted of a trans-membrane domain and predicted to be localized in the plasma-membrane. A diverse expression pattern of TaLRK genes was found in various developmental stages and stress conditions. Some TaLRKs were found to be highly affected during a particular stress, which indicated a specialized role of each LRK gene in a specific stress condition. These results described various characteristic feature and expression pattern of TaLRK genes, which will pave the way for functional characterization in wheat."

Hi-Line using the biolistic bombardment method. High levels of expression of the HVA1 gene, regulated by the maize ubi1 promoter, were observed in leaves and roots of independent transgenic wheat plants and were inherited by offspring generations. T(3) progenies of four selected transgenic wheat lines were tested under greenhouse conditions for tolerance of soil water deficit. Potted plants were grown under moderate water deficit and well-watered conditions, respectively. Two homozygous and one heterozygous transgenic lines expressing the HVA1 gene had significantly (P<0.01) higher water use efficiency values, 0.66-0.68 g kg(-1), as compared to 0.57 and 0.53 g kg(-1), respectively, for the non-expressing transgenic and non-transgenic controls under moderate water deficit conditions. The two homozygous transgenic plant lines also had significantly greater total dry mass, root fresh and dry weights, and shoot dry weight compared to the two controls under soil water deficit conditions. Results of this study indicate that growth characteristics were improved in transgenic wheat plants constitutively expressing the barley HVA1 gene in response to soil water deficit."

"15714330","abstracttext","Our objective was to partially sequence genes controlling nitrogen metabolism in wheat species in order to find sequence polymorphism that would enable their mapping. Primers were designed for nitrate reductase, nitrite reductase, glutamate dehydrogenase and glutamate synthase (GOGAT), and gene fragments were amplified on Triticum aestivum, T. durum, T. monococcum, T. speltoides and T. tauschii. We obtained more than 8 kb of gene sequences, mainly as coding regions (60%). Polymorphism was quantified by comparing two-by-two the three genomes of the hexaploid cultivar Arche and genomes of diploid wheat species. On average, the polymorphism rate was higher for non-coding regions, where it ranged from 1/60 to 1/23, than for coding regions (range: 1/110-1/40) except when the hexaploid D genome was compared to that of T. tauschii (1/800 and 1/816, respectively). Genome-specific primers were devised for the ferredoxin-dependent (Fd)-GOGAT gene, and they enabled the mapping of this gene on homoeologous chromosomes of group 2 using Chinese Spring deletion lines. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detected between the two hexaploid wheat cultivars Arche and Recital was used to genetically map Fd-GOGAT on chromosome 2D using a population of dihaploid lines. Fd-GOGAT-specific primers were used to estimate the SNP rate on a set of 11 hexaploid and nine Durum wheat genotypes leading to the estimate of 1 SNP/515 bp. We demonstrate that polymorphism detection enables heterologous, homeologous and even paralogous copies to be assigned, even if the elaboration of specific primer pairs is time-consuming and expensive because of the sequencing."

"17571251","abstracttext","Toxicity due to high levels of soil boron (B) represents a significant limitation to cereal production in some regions, and the Bo1 gene provides a major source of B toxicity tolerance in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A novel approach was used to develop primers to amplify and sequence gene fragments specifically from the Bo1 region of the hexaploid wheat genome. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identified were then used to generate markers close to Bo1 on the distal end of chromosome 7BL. In the 16 gene fragments totaling 19.6 kb, SNPs were observed between the two cultivars Cranbrook and Halberd at a low frequency (one every 613 bp). Furthermore, SNPs were distributed unevenly, being limited to only two genes. In contrast, RFLP provided a much greater number of genetic markers, with every tested gene identifying polymorphism. Bo1 previously known only as a QTL was located as a discrete Mendelian locus. In total, 28 new RFLP, PCR and SSR markers were added to the existing map. The 1.8 cM Bo1 interval of wheat corresponds to a 227 kb section of rice chromosome 6L encoding 21 predicted proteins with no homology to any known B transporters. The co-dominant PCR marker AWW5L7 co-segregated with Bo1 and was highly predictive of B tolerance status within a set of 94 Australian bread wheat cultivars and breeding lines. The markers and rice colinearity described here represent tools that will assist B tolerance breeding and the positional cloning of Bo1."

"19914842","abstracttext","A sequence encoding a putative type-1 lipid transfer protein from wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell) was identified through 'GeneCalling', an mRNA profiling technology. The mRNA for the Hfr-LTP (Hessian fly-responsive lipid transfer protein) gene decreased in abundance (196-fold) in susceptible wheat plants over the first eight days of attack by virulent Hessian fly larvae (Mayetiola destructor Say). Hfr-LTP encodes a putative protein containing eight cysteine residues that are conserved among plant LTPs and are responsible for correct protein folding through formation of disulfide bridges. Twelve hydrophobic amino acids in addition to arginine, glycine, proline, serine, threonine and tyrosine, plus an LTP signature sequence were present in conserved positions. A highly conserved signal peptide sequence was also present. Although attack by one virulent larva was sufficient to cause a decrease in Hfr-LTP mRNA abundance, higher infestation levels led to near silencing of the gene. Hfr-LTP transcript levels were not affected by other biotic factors (feeding by bird cherry-oat aphid, Rhopalosiphum padi L., and fall armyworm larvae, Spodoptera frugiperda Smith) or abiotic factors tested (mechanical wounding or treatment with abscisic acid, methyl jasmonate, or salicylic acid). Comparison to a previously described Hessian fly-responsive wheat LTP gene, TaLTP3, confirmed an initial increase in TaLTP3 mRNA in resistant plants. However, when quantified through eight days after egg hatch, responsiveness to infestation level and a marked decrease in susceptible plant TaLTP3 mRNA abundance were detected, as was seen for Hfr-LTP. Possible functions of LTP gene products in wheat-Hessian fly interactions are discussed."

"21838715","abstracttext","The genomes of cereals such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) are large and therefore problematic for the map-based cloning of agronomicaly important traits. However, comparative approaches within the Poaceae permit transfer of molecular knowledge between species, despite their divergence from a common ancestor sixty million years ago. The finding that null variants of the rice gene cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase 2 (OsCKX2) result in large yield increases provides an opportunity to explore whether similar gains could be achieved in other Poaceae members. Here, phylogenetic, molecular and comparative analyses of CKX families in the sequenced grass species rice, brachypodium, sorghum, maize and foxtail millet, as well as members identified from the transcriptomes/genomes of wheat and barley, are presented. Phylogenetic analyses define four Poaceae CKX clades. Comparative analyses showed that CKX phylogenetic groupings can largely be explained by a combination of local gene duplication, and the whole-genome duplication event that predates their speciation. Full-length OsCKX2 homologues in barley (HvCKX2.1, HvCKX2.2) and wheat (TaCKX2.3, TaCKX2.4, TaCKX2.5) are characterized, with comparative analysis at the DNA, protein and genetic/physical map levels suggesting that true CKX2 orthologs have been identified. Furthermore, our analysis shows CKX2 genes in barley and wheat have undergone a Triticeae-specific gene-duplication event. Finally, by identifying ten of the eleven CKX genes predicted to be present in barley by comparative analyses, we show that next-generation sequencing approaches can efficiently determine the gene space of large-genome crops. Together, this work provides the foundation for future functional investigation of CKX family members within the Poaceae."

Only 19 out of the 62 ω-secalin gene sequences were full-length open reading frames (ORFs), which can be expressed into functional proteins. The other 43 DNA sequences were pseudogenes, as their ORFs were interrupted by one or a few stop codons or frameshift mutations. The 19 ω-secalin genes have a typical primary structure, which is different from wheat gliadins. There was no cysteine residue in ω-secalin proteins, and the potential celiac disease (CD) toxic epitope (PQQP) was identified to appear frequently in the repetitive domains. The ω-secalin genes from various cereal species shared high homology in their gene sequences. The ω-secalin gene family has involved fewer variations after the integration of the rye R chromosome or whole genome into the wheat or triticale genome. The higher Ka/Ks ratio (i.e. non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions per site) in ω-secalin pseudogenes than in ω-secalin ORFs indicate that the pseudogenes may be subject to a reduced selection pressure. Based on the conserved sequences of ω-secalin genes, it will be possible to manipulate the expression of this gene family in rye, triticale, or wheat 1BL/1RS translocation lines, to reduce its negative effects on grain quality."

Liangxing 99, one of the most widely grown commercial cultivars in the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) producing regions in northern China, was shown to provide a broad spectrum of resistance to Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) isolates originating from that region. Using an F2 population and F2:3 lines derived from a cross of Liangxing 99 × Zhongzuo 9504, genetic analysis demonstrated that a single dominant gene, designated MlLX99, was responsible for the resistance of Liangxing 99 to Bgt isolate E09. The results of molecular analysis indicated that this gene is located on chromosome 2BL and flanked by the SSR marker Xgwm120 and EST-STS marker BE604758 at genetic distances of 2.9 and 5.5 cM, respectively. Since the flanking markers of MlLX99 were previously mapped to the bin 2BL2-0.36-0.50, MlLX99 must be located in this chromosomal region. MlLX99 showed a different resistance reaction pattern to 60 Bgt isolates from Pm6, Pm33, and PmJM22, which were all previously mapped on chromosome 2BL, but differed in their positions from MlLX99. Due to its unique position on chromosome 2BL, MlLX99 appears to be a new locus for resistance to powdery mildew. Liangxing 99 has shown superior yield performance and wide adaptation to different agricultural conditions, which has resulted in its extensive use as a wheat cultivar in China. The identification of resistance gene MlLX99 facilitates the use of this cultivar in the protection of wheat from damage caused by powdery mildew."

"28821592","abstracttext","Aneuploidy, a condition of unbalanced chromosome content, represents a large-effect mutation that bears significant relevance to human health and microbe adaptation. As such, extensive studies of aneuploidy have been conducted in unicellular model organisms and cancer cells. Aneuploidy also frequently is associated with plant polyploidization, but its impact on gene expression and its relevance to polyploid genome evolution/functional innovation remain largely unknown. Here, we used a panel of diverse types of whole-chromosome aneuploidy of hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), all under the common genetic background of cv Chinese Spring, to systemically investigate the impact of aneuploidy on genome-, subgenome-, and chromosome-wide gene expression. Compared with prior findings in haploid or diploid aneuploid systems, we unravel additional and novel features of alteration in global gene expression resulting from the two major impacts of aneuploidy, cis- and trans-regulation, as well as dosage compensation. We show that the expression-altered genes map evenly along each chromosome, with no evidence for coregulating aggregated expression domains. However, chromosomes and subgenomes in hexaploid wheat are unequal in their responses to aneuploidy with respect to the number of genes being dysregulated. Strikingly, homeologous chromosomes do not differ from nonhomologous chromosomes in terms of aneuploidy-induced trans-acting effects, suggesting that the three constituent subgenomes of hexaploid wheat are largely uncoupled at the transcriptional level of gene regulation. Together, our findings shed new insights into the functional interplay between homeologous chromosomes and interactions between subgenomes in hexaploid wheat, which bear implications to further our understanding of allopolyploid genome evolution and efforts in breeding new allopolyploid crops."

Stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Pgt) races belonging to the Ug99 (TTKSK) race group pose a serious threat to global wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. To improve Pgt host resistance, the Ug99-effective resistance gene SrTA10187 previously identified in Aegilops tauschii Coss. was introgressed into wheat, and mapped to the short arm of wheat chromosome 6D. In this study, high-resolution mapping of SrTA10187 was done using a population of 1,060 plants. Pgt resistance was screened using race QFCSC. PCR-based SNP and STS markers were developed from genotyping-by-sequencing tags and SNP sequences available in online databases. SrTA10187 segregated as expected in a 3:1 ratio of resistant to susceptible individuals in three out of six BC 3 F 2 families, and was fine-mapped to a 1.1 cM region on wheat chromosome 6DS. Marker context sequence was aligned to the reference Ae. tauschii genome to identify the physical region encompassing SrTA10187. Due to the size of the corresponding region, candidate disease resistance genes could not be identified with confidence. Comparisons with the Ae. tauschii genetic map developed by Luo et al. (PNAS 110(19):7940-7945, 2013) enabled identification of a discrete genetic locus and a BAC minimum tiling path of the region spanning SrTA10187. Annotation of pooled BAC library sequences led to the identification of candidate genes in the region of interest-including a single NB-ARC-LRR gene. The shorter genetic interval and flanking KASP™ and STS markers developed in this study will facilitate marker-assisted selection, gene pyramiding, and positional cloning of SrTA10187."
"32380646","articletitle","Over-Expressing TaSPA-B Reduces Prolamin and Starch Accumulation in Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) Grains."
"32380646","abstracttext","Starch and prolamin composition and content are important indexes for determining the processing and nutritional quality of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) grains. Several transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression during starch and protein biosynthesis in wheat. Storage protein activator (TaSPA), a member of the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) family, has been reported to activate glutenin genes and is correlated to starch synthesis related genes. In this study, we generated TaSPA-B overexpressing (OE) transgenic wheat lines. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, the starch content was slightly reduced and starch granules exhibited a more polarized distribution in the TaSPA-B OE lines. Moreover, glutenin and ω- gliadin contents were significantly reduced, with lower expression levels of related genes (e.g., By15 , Dx2, and ω-1,2 gliadin gene). RNA-seq analysis identified 2023 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The low expression of some DEGs (e.g., SUSase , ADPase , Pho1 , Waxy , SBE , SSI , and SS II a ) might explain the reduction of starch contents. Some TFs involved in glutenin and starch synthesis might be regulated by TaSPA-B, for example, TaPBF was reduced in TaSPA-B OE-3 lines. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assay indicated that both TaSPA-B and TaPBF could transactivate the promoter of ω-1,2 gliadin gene. These results suggest that TaSPA-B regulates a complex gene network and plays an important role in starch and protein biosynthesis in wheat."

"31249596","abstracttext","Plant protein phosphatase 2Cs (PP2Cs) play crucial roles in phytohormone signaling, developmental processes, and both biotic and abiotic stress responses. However, little research has been conducted on the PP2C gene family in hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), which is an important cereal crop. In this study, a genome-wide investigation of TaPP2C gene family was performed. A total of 257 homoeologs of 95 TaPP2C genes were identified, of which 80% of genes had all the three homoeologs across A, B, and D subgenomes. Domain analysis indicated that all the TaPP2C homoeologs harbored the type 2C phosphatase domains. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, TaPP2Cs were divided into 13 groups (A-M) and 4 single branches, which corresponded to the results of gene structure and protein motif analyses. Results of chromosomal location and synteny relationship analysis of TaPP2C homoeologs revealed that known chromosome translocation events and pericentromeric inversions were responsible for the formation of TaPP2C gene family. Expression patterns of TaPP2C homoeologs in various tissues and under diverse stress conditions were analyzed using publicly available RNA-seq data. The results suggested that TaPP2C genes regulate wheat developmental processes and stress responses. Homoeologous expression patterns of TaPP2C triad homoeologs from A, B, and D subgenomes, revealed expression bias within triads under the normal condition, and variability in expression under different stress treatments. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis of eight TaPP2C genes in group A revealed that they were all up-regulated after abscisic acid treatment. Some genes in group A also responded to other phytohormones such as methyl jasmonate and gibberellin. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed that group A TaPP2Cs also interacted with TaSnRK2.1 and TaSnRK2.2 from subclass II, besides with subclass III TaSnRK2s. TaPP2C135 in group A was transformed into Arabidopsis and germination assay revealed that ectopic expression of TaPP2C135 in Arabidopsis enhanced its tolerance to ABA. Overall, these results enhance our understanding of the function of TaPP2Cs in wheat, and provide novel insights into the roles of group A TaPP2Cs. This information will be useful for in-depth functional analysis of TaPP2Cs in future studies and for wheat breeding."

"12582643","abstracttext","Analysis by SDS-PAGE of total protein fractions from single seeds of Aegilops cylindrica (genomes C and D) and Triticum timopheevi (genomes A and G) showed the presence of three bands corresponding to high molecular weight subunits of glutenin (HMW subunits) in the former and two major bands and a minor band corresponding to HMW subunits in the latter. Three Ae. cylindrica and two T. timopheevi HMW subunit gene sequences, each comprising the entire coding region, were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and their complete nucleotide sequences determined. A combination of N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the proteins identified by SDS-PAGE and alignments of the derived amino acid sequences of the proteins encoded by the PCR products identified the Ae. cylindrica HMW subunits as 1Cx, 1Cy and 1Dy, and the T. timopheevi HMW subunits as 1Gx, 1Ax and 1Ay. It was not clear whether or not a 1Gy HMW subunit was present in T. timopheevi. The PCR products from Ae. cyclindrica were derived from 1Cy and 1Dy genes and a silent 1Dx gene containing an in-frame internal stop codon, while those from T. timopheevi were derived from 1Ax and 1Ay genes. The 1Cx, 1Gx and 1Gy sequences were not amplified successfully. The proteins encoded by the five novel genes had similar structures to previously characterized HMW subunits of bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum). Differences and similarities in sequence and structure, and in the distribution of cysteine residues (relevant to the ability of HMW subunits to form high M(r) polymers) distinguished the HMW subunits of x- and y-type and of each genome rather than those of the different species. There was no evidence of a change in HMW subunit expression or structure resulting from selective breeding of bread wheat. The novel 1Ax, 1Ay, 1Cy and 1Dy HMW subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli, and the expressed proteins were shown to have very similar mobilities to the endogenous HMW subunits on SDS-PAGE. The truncated 1Dx gene from Ae. cylindrica failed to express in E. coli, and no HMW subunit-related protein of the size predicted for the truncated 1Dx subunit could be identified by immunodetection in seed extracts."

"728070","abstracttext","Inheritance of gliadin components unique to three different varieties of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was studied in F1 and F2 seeds of intervarietal crosses using protein patterns obtained by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in aluminum lactate buffer (pH 3.2). The patterns of F1 seeds of the crosses Cheyenne X Justin and INIA 66R X Justin evidenced all the bands present in the patterns of the parents; band intensities reflected gene dosage levels dependent on whether the contributing parent was maternal or paternal in accordance with the triploid nature of endosperm tissue. Most of the gliadin components examined segregated in accordance with control by a single dominant gene, but in two instances single bands in the one-dimensional electrophoretic patterns segregated in the F2 as expected if controlled by two genes. A method of two-dimensional electrophoresis was developed that resolved these apparently single bands into two components each, which could segregate independently. Linkage analysis provided evidence of codominant alleles and closely linked genes coding for gliadin protein components in both coupling and repulsion situations. The gliadin protein components seem to be coded for by clusters of genes located on chromosomes of homoeologous groups 1 and 6 in hexaploid wheats."

"11093578","abstracttext","The effect of prolonged colchicine-induced polyploidization on activation of latent nucleolus-organizing regions (NOR) of chromosomes was studied in diploid meristematic cells and polyploid root cells of Triticum aestivum L. It has been shown that control diploid and tetraploid cells have maximal number of nucleoli equal to four, which corresponds to the number of nucleolar chromosomes (NC) with active (visualized by staining with AgNO3) NOR (two pairs of homologous chromosomes 1B and 6B). Treatment of wheat seedlings with colchicine for 30 h results in following changes in polyploid cells: (1) impregnation of NOR with silver is observed on homologues of either chromosomes 1A or 5D in all tetraploid metaphase plates (4n, 2x, 4c), which is indicative of the NOR activation on this chromosome in pre-mitotic polyploid interphase; (2) In tetraploid metaphase, NOR in all four homologues of activated chromosomes or in only two of them may be stained; (3) maximal number of nucleoli in tetraploid nuclei is increased till 12, which confirms activation of transcription of additional rRNA gene clusters in polyploids; (4) activation of the rRNA gene expression is induced by the cell polyploidization rather than by colchicine, since in the colchicine-treated diploid cells both maximal number of nucleoli and the number of metaphase chromosomes with active NOR is not changed as compared with control. The obtained data allow us to suggest that structural ""separation"" of NC in polyploid nuclei stimulates activation of latent NOR."

"12746512","abstracttext","Cold acclimation is a multigenic trait that allows hardy plants to develop efficient tolerance mechanisms needed for winter survival. To determine the genetic nature of these mechanisms, several cold-responsive genes of unknown function were identified from cold-acclimated wheat (Triticum aestivum). To identify the putative functions and structural features of these new genes, integrated genomic approaches of data mining, expression profiling, and bioinformatic predictions were used. The analyses revealed that one of these genes is a member of a small family that encodes two distinct groups of multispanning transmembrane proteins. The cold-regulated (COR)413-plasma membrane and COR413-thylakoid membrane groups are potentially targeted to the plasma membrane and thylakoid membrane, respectively. Further sequence analysis of the two groups from different plant species revealed the presence of a highly conserved phosphorylation site and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchoring site at the C-terminal end. No homologous sequences were found in other organisms suggesting that this family is specific to the plant kingdom. Intraspecies and interspecies comparative gene expression profiling shows that the expression of this gene family is correlated with the development of freezing tolerance in cereals and Arabidopsis. In addition, several members of the family are regulated by water stress, light, and abscisic acid. Structure predictions and comparative genome analyses allow us to propose that the cor413 genes encode putative G-protein-coupled receptors."

"16450183","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (PST), is one of the most damaging diseases in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). With the objective of identifying and tagging new genes for resistance to stripe rust, F1, F2 and F3 populations from the cross Zhou 8425B/Chinese Spring were inoculated with Chinese PST isolate CYR32 in the greenhouse. A total of 790 SSR primers were used to test the parents and resistant and susceptible bulks. The resulting seven polymorphic markers on chromosome 7BL were used for genotyping F2 and F3 populations. Results indicated that Zhou 8425B carries a single dominant resistance gene, temporarily designated YrZH84, closely linked to SSR markers Xcfa2040-7B and Xbarc32-7B with genetic distances of 1.4 and 4.8 cM, respectively. In a seedling test with 25 PST isolates, the reaction patterns of YrZH84 were different from those of lines carrying Yr2 and Yr6. It was concluded that YrZH84 is probably a new stripe rust resistance gene."
"22751213","articletitle","A shrunken-2 transgene increases maize yield by acting in maternal tissues to increase the frequency of seed development."
"22751213","abstracttext","The maize (Zea mays) shrunken-2 (Sh2) gene encodes the large subunit of the rate-limiting starch biosynthetic enzyme, ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase. Expression of a transgenic form of the enzyme with enhanced heat stability and reduced phosphate inhibition increased maize yield up to 64%. The extent of the yield increase is dependent on temperatures during the first 4 d post pollination, and yield is increased if average daily high temperatures exceed 33 °C. As found in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa), this transgene increases maize yield by increasing seed number. This result was surprising, since an entire series of historic observations at the whole-plant, enzyme, gene, and physiological levels pointed to Sh2 playing an important role only in the endosperm. Here, we present several lines of evidence that lead to the conclusion that the Sh2 transgene functions in maternal tissue to increase seed number and, in turn, yield. Furthermore, the transgene does not increase ovary number; rather, it increases the probability that a seed will develop. Surprisingly, the number of fully developed seeds is only ∼50% of the number of ovaries in wild-type maize. This suggests that increasing the frequency of seed development is a feasible agricultural target, especially under conditions of elevated temperatures."

"22729884","abstracttext","F-box proteins, components of the Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) protein E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, serve as the variable component responsible for substrate recognition and recruitment in SCF-mediated proteolysis. F-box proteins interact with Skp1 through the F-box motif and with ubiquitination substrates through C-terminal protein interaction domains. F-box proteins regulate plant development, various hormonal signal transduction processes, circadian rhythm, and cell cycle control. We isolated an F-box protein gene from wheat spikes at the onset of flowering. The Triticum aestivum cyclin F-box domain (TaCFBD) gene showed elevated expression levels during early inflorescence development and under cold stress treatment. TaCFBD green fluorescent protein signals were localized in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane. We used yeast two-hybrid screening to identify proteins that potentially interact with TaCFBD. Fructose bisphosphate aldolase, aspartic protease, VHS, glycine-rich RNA-binding protein, and the 26S proteasome non-ATPase regulatory subunit were positive candidate proteins. The bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay revealed the interaction of TaCFBD with partner proteins in the plasma membranes of tobacco cells. Our results suggest that the TaCFBD protein acts as an adaptor between target substrates and the SCF complex and provides substrate specificity to the SCF of ubiquitin ligase complexes."
"19132075","articletitle","A quantitative genomic imbalance gene expression assay in a hexaploid species: wheat (Triticum aestivum)."
"19132075","abstracttext","Responses to allopolyploidy include unequal expression of duplicated genes, gene silencing, and sometimes genomic rearrangements. In plants, the relationship between allelic expression differences arising from changes in regulatory regions and the resulting phenotype is poorly understood because of the complexity of their genomes and lack of efficient methodology to identify regulatory variation. Identifying functionally important regulatory variation in crops such as hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) is in its infancy. More knowledge is required about the contribution of participatory genomes to its transcriptome. In this paper, we demonstrate the use of allelic imbalance assays to quantify relative expression levels across tissues and growth regimes of homoeologous transcripts of the A, B, and D genomes. Polymorphisms in the type I thionins have been used as an example. We show that expression levels vary markedly and interactively over all factors. For this gene, the B genome is the smallest contributor to the transcriptome and the D genome the largest. As additional sequence information is accumulated across genomes, this assay will allow the simple study of relative expression across multiple homeologous loci."

"22174625","abstracttext","In animals and recently in plants, heme oxygenase-1 (HO1) has been found to confer protection against a variety of oxidant-induced cell and tissue injuries. In this study, a wheat (Triticum aestivum) HO1 gene TaHO1 was cloned and sequenced. It encodes a polypeptide of 31.7 kD with a putative N-terminal plastid transit peptide. The amino acid sequence of TaHO1 was found to be 78% similar to that of maize HO1. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TaHO1 clusters together with the HO1-like sequences in plants. The purified recombinant TaHO1 protein expressed in Escherichia coli was active in the conversion of heme to biliverdin IXa (BV), and showed that the V(max) was 8.8 U·mg(-1) protein with an apparent K(m) value for hemin of 3.04 μM. The optimum Tm and pH were 35 °C and 7.4, respectively. The result of subcellular localization of TaHO1 showed that the putative transit peptide was sufficient for green fluorescent protein (GFP) to localize in chloroplast and implied that TaHO1 gene product is at least localized in the chloroplast. Moreover, we found that TaHO1 mRNA could be differentially induced by the well-known nitric oxide (NO) donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), gibberellin acid (GA), abscisic acid (ABA), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and NaCl treatments. Therefore, the results suggested that TaHO1 might play an important role in abiotic stress responses."

"23039848","abstracttext","On the basis of microarray analyses of the salt-tolerant wheat mutant RH8706-49, a previously unreported salt-induced gene, designated as TaHPS [Triticum aestivum hypothetical (HPS)-like protein], was cloned. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that expression of the gene was induced by abscisic acid, salt and drought. The encoded protein was found to be localized mainly in the plasma membranes. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaHPS were more tolerant to salt and drought stresses than non-transgenic wild-type (WT) plants. Under salt stress, the root cells of the transgenic plants secreted more Na⁺ and guard cells took up more Ca²⁺ ions. Compared with wild-type plants, TaHPS-expressing transgenic plants showed significantly lower amylase activity and glucose and malic acid levels. Our results showed that the expression of TaHPS inhibited amylase activity, which subsequently led to a closure of stomatal apertures and thus improved plant tolerance to salt and drought."

"23969557","abstracttext","This study compared the photosynthetic performance and the global gene expression of the winter hardy wheat Triticum aestivum cv Norstar grown under non-acclimated (NA) or cold-acclimated (CA) conditions at either ambient CO2 or elevated CO2. CA Norstar maintained comparable light-saturated and CO2-saturated rates of photosynthesis but lower quantum requirements for PSII and non-photochemical quenching relative to NA plants even at elevated CO2. Neither NA nor CA plants were sensitive to feedback inhibition of photosynthesis at elevated CO2. Global gene expression using microarray combined with bioinformatics analysis revealed that genes affected by elevated CO2 were three times higher in NA (1,022 genes) compared with CA (372 genes) Norstar. The most striking effect was the down-regulation of genes involved in the plant defense responses in NA Norstar. In contrast, cold acclimation reversed this down-regulation due to the cold induction of genes involved in plant pathogenesis resistance; and cellular and chloroplast protection. These results suggest that elevated CO2 has less impact on plant performance and productivity in cold-adapted winter hardy plants in the northern climates compared with warmer environments. Selection for cereal cultivars with constitutively higher expression of biotic stress defense genes may be necessary under elevated CO2 during the warm growth period and in warmer climates."

Genetical analysis of this chromosome has been carried out using single-chromosome recombinant lines to establish the pleiotropic effects of this locus and two other major genes, q determining ear morphology and bl determining the presence of awns, on important agronomic characters. The three major genes were located on the long arm of chromosome 5A with a gene order of: centromere -bl-q-Vrnl. Analysis of quantitative characters from a winter sowing revealed pleiotropic effects of Vrnl or the effects of closely linked loci on the characters plant height, tiller number and spikelet number. However effects on ear emergence time were not associated with Vrnl but with q as were effects on spikelet number and ear length. In addition a locus determining yield/plant was located between Vrnl and q. Independant loci determining height and ear length were apparent on the short arm of chromosome 5A. From a spring sowing, however, there was a large pleiotropic effect of Vrnl on ear emergence time, as well as the effects previously detected. In addition, associated with q were effects on plant height and grain size which were not expressed from the winter sowing."

Generally, all high molecular weight glutenins had a similar amino acid composition but several significant differences were observed in some of them. Both analyses revealed that the structural similarity among the various subunits was related to the homology of the genes coding them: subunits coded by homoalleles, i.e., different alleles of the same gene, were most similar; those coded by homoeoalleles, i.e., alleles of homoeologous genes, were less similar; whereas subunits coded either by alleles of different genes of the same gene cluster, or by nonhomoeoalleles of homoeologous clusters, were the least similar. Several small peptides derived from protease digestion of various subunits had a higher than expected staining intensity indicating that small peptide repeats may be interspersed within the glutenin subunits. The evolutionary course of the high molecular weight glutenins is discussed."

The method (with modification) involved inactivation of genomic DNA by DNase I enzyme, RNA by RNase enzyme, contaminant proteins by using proteinase K, and precipitation of polysaccharides in the presence of a high salt concentration. The DNase I and RNA enzyme ratio was adjusted to 10:8 mL. The purity of mtDNA was confirmed by PCR amplification of genomic, mitochondrial, and chloroplast (rbcL) gene. The mitochondrial COXIII gene of 400 bp was amplified; the b-actin and chloroplast genes were not amplified. A260/A280 (1.89) and A260/A230 (2.07) ratios were calculated using a spectrophotometer.

"29298909","abstracttext","Molecular and genomic studies have shown the presence of a large number of SPX gene family members in plants, some of which have been proved to act in P signalling and homeostasis. In this study, the molecular and evolutionary characteristics of the SPX gene family in plants were comprehensively analysed, and the mechanisms underlying the function of SPX genes in P signalling and homeostasis in the model plant species Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) and rice ( Oryza sativa ), and in important crops, including wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), soya beans ( Glycine max ) and rapeseed ( Brassica napus ), were described. Emerging findings on the involvement of SPX genes in other important processes (i.e. disease resistance, iron deficiency response, low oxygen response and phytochrome-mediated light signalling) were also highlighted. The available data suggest that SPX genes are important regulators in the P signalling network, and may be valuable targets for enhancing crop tolerance to low P stress. Further studies on SPX proteins should include more diverse members, which may reveal SPX proteins as important regulatory hubs for multiple processes including P signalling and homeostasis in plants."

"29169922","abstracttext","Recently, engineered minichromosomes have been produced using a telomere-mediated truncation technique in some plants. However, the study on transferring genes to minichromosomes is very limited. Here, telomere-mediated truncation was successfully performed in common wheat (Triticum aestivum) to generate stable truncated chromosomes accompanied by a relatively high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements. After the cross between transgenic parents, a promoter-less DsRed gene in a chromosome from one parent was transferred to another chromosome from the other parent at the site behind a maize ubiquitin promoter via the Cre/lox system. DsRed transcripts and red fluorescent proteins were detected in the recombinant plants. In one such seedling, transgenic signals were detected at the centric terminus of chromosome 4D and the distal terminus of chromosome 3A. Clear translocations could be detected at the transgenic loci of these two chromosomes. Intriguingly, signals of centric-specific sequences were co-localized with the translocated D-group chromosomal segment in the terminal region of chromosome 3A. Our results indicate that the Cre/lox system induces the gene swapping to the target chromosome and non-homologous chromosomal recombination simultaneously. These approaches could offer a platform to transfer large DNA fragments or even terminal chromosomal segments to other chromosomes of the natural genome."

"32480585","abstracttext","A suppressor screen using the dwarf Rht-B1c Della mutant of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) led to the isolation of overgrowth mutants, which retained the original dwarfing gene but grew at a faster rate because of a new mutation elsewhere in that gene. Forty-six alleles were identified, which included amino acid substitutions, premature stop codons, and splice site alterations. The sites of amino acid substitution were primarily localised around conserved motifs in the DELLA protein, and these mutants showed a wide range in their extent of growth recovery (dwarf, semidwarf, tall). Detailed growth comparisons were made on a wide height range of backcrossed overgrowth alleles, comparing stem and spike growth, leaf size, tillering, phenological development, coleoptile length, grain dormancy and grain yield. There were large and reproducible differences between alleles for some traits, whereas others were largely unaffected or varied with growth conditions. Some of the overgrowth alleles offer promise as alternatives to the Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b dwarfing genes, allowing a wider range of height control, improved grain dormancy and equivalent grain yield. The collection of mutants will also be valuable as a resource to study the effect of height on different physiological or agronomic traits, and in elucidating DELLA protein function."

"7580858","abstracttext","A full-length cDNA clone representing the large (shrunken-2) subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGP; EC 2.7.7.27) has been isolated from a cDNA library prepared from developing grain of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Chinese Spring). The 2084-bp cDNA insert contains an open reading frame of 1566 nucleotides and primer-extension analysis indicated that the 5' end is 10 nucleotides shorter than the mRNA. The deduced protein contains 522 amino acids (57.8 kDa) and includes a putative transit peptide of 62 amino acids (6.5 kDa). The similarity of the deduced protein to the small subunit of AGP and to other AGP genes from plants and microorganisms is discussed. Northern hybridisation shows that the Agp1 genes (encoding the small subunit in the wheat endosperm) and the Agp2 genes (encoding the large subunit in the wheat endosperm) are differentially expressed in the wheat grain. Transcripts from both gene sets accumulate to high levels in the endosperm during grain development with the majority of the expression in the endopsperm rather than the embryo and pericarp layers. Although enzyme activity is detected in developing grains prior to 10 d post anthesis, only the Agp1 genes are active at this time (the Agp2 genes are not expressed until 10 d post anthesis). The possibility that the enzyme expressed during early grain development is a homotetramer of small subunits is discussed. The Agp1 and Agp2 genes are arranged as triplicate sets of single-copy homoeoloci in wheat. The Agp2 genes are located on the long arms of chromosomes 1A, 1B and 1D, about 80 cM from the centromere. The Agp1 genes have been mapped to a position just distal to the centromere on the long arms of chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D."
"9247545","articletitle","cDNA structure and expression patterns of a low-temperature-specific wheat gene tacr7."
"9247545","abstracttext","The low-temperature (2 degrees C)-specific wheat cDNA, pTACR7, represents a gene designated tacr7 from hard red winter wheat (HRWW; Triticum aestivum L. cv. Winoka). The term low-temperature-specific (LTS) is used because tacr7 is not induced by ABA or stresses such as salt, dehydration, and heat. pTACR7 was isolated by RT-PCR with mRNA from wheat crown tissue, the oligonucleotide primers derived from the barley cognate pHVCR8 (GenBank accession number L28091). Based on the deduced amino acid sequence, TACR7 is highly hydrophobic, with a single transmembrane domain and an amino acid bias for leucine (19%). Thus, the encoded protein TACR7 is unique among low-temperature-regulated wheat proteins described in the literature. Analysis of steady-state levels of tacr7 transcripts (630 nt) showed accumulation in wheat seedlings, crown tissue, and callus cultures after transfer from control (25 degrees C) to low temperature (2 degrees C). No detectable transcripts were observed by northern blot hybridization with pTACR7 probe from seedling or callus treated with ABA, salt, dehydration, or heat stress. tacr7 transcripts accumulated during 2 degrees C exposure to a greater amount in a freeze-resistant HRWW (FR; SDmut 16029) than in a freeze-susceptible HRWW (FS; SDmut 16169) crown tissue, with the largest difference between genotypes being 30% +/- 3% at 3 weeks."

"10759535","abstracttext","Excessive low-affinity Na(+) uptake is toxic to the growth of glycophytic plants. Recently, several reports have suggested that the interaction between K(+) and Na(+) uptake might represent a key factor in determining the Na(+) tolerance of plants. We investigated the effects of K(+) starvation on Na(+) and K(+) uptake mechanisms in the plasma membrane of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) root cortex cells using the patch-clamp technique. Unexpectedly, K(+) starvation of wheat seedlings was found to enhance the magnitude and frequency of occurrence of time-dependent inward-rectifying K(+) channel currents (I(K)(+)(in)). We examined whether the transcription of a wheat root K(+)(in) channel gene is induced by K(+) starvation. A cDNA coding for a wheat root K(+) channel homolog, TaAKT1 (accession no. AF207745), was isolated. TaAKT1 mRNA levels were up-regulated in roots in response to withdrawal of K(+) from the growth medium. Furthermore, K(+) starvation caused an enhancement of instantaneous Na(+) currents (I(Na)(+)). Electrophysiological analyses suggested that I(K)(+)(in) and I(Na)(+) are not mediated by the same transport protein based on: (a) different activation curves, (b) different time dependencies, (c) different sensitivities to external Ca(2+), and (d) different cation selectivities. These data implicate a role for I(Na)(+) in Na(+) uptake and stress during K(+) starvation, and indicate that K(+)(in) channels may contribute to K(+)-starvation-induced K(+) uptake in wheat roots."

"15499395","abstracttext","Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) are a valuable source of molecular markers. To enhance the resolution of an existing linkage map and to identify putative functional polymorphic gene loci in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), over 260,000 ESTs from 5 different grass species were analyzed and 5418 SSR-containing sequences were identified. Using sequence similarity analysis, 156 cross-species superclusters and 138 singletons were used to develop primer pairs, which were then tested on the genomic DNA of barley (Hordeum vulgare), maize (Zea mays), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat. Three-hundred sixty-eight primer pairs produced PCR amplicons from at least one species and 227 primer pairs amplified DNA from two or more species. EST-SSR sequences containing dinucleotide motifs were significantly more polymorphic (74%) than those containing trinucleotides (56%), and polymorphism was similar for markers in both coding and 5' untranslated (UTR) regions. Out of 112 EST-SSR markers, 90 identified 149 loci that were integrated into a reference wheat genetic map. These loci were distributed on 19 of the 21 wheat chromosomes and were clustered in the distal chromosomal regions. Multiple-loci were detected by 39% of the primer pairs. Of the 90 mapped ESTs, putative functions for 22 were identified using BLASTX queries. In addition, 80 EST-SSR markers (104 loci) were located to chromosomes using nullisomic-tetrasomic lines. The enhanced map from this study provides a basis for comparative mapping using orthologous and PCR-based markers and for identification of expressed genes possibly affecting important traits in wheat."

"15551037","abstracttext","High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) from hybrid line II-12 between wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and Agropyron elongatum (Host) Nivski were characterized with SDS-PAGE. Out of these HMW-GSs, two subunits, h1Bx and h1By, had mobilities similar to the subunits 1Bx13 and 1By16 from common wheat 4072, which was used as control. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) of h1Bx and h1By were prepared, and Western blotting showed that the pAbs had strong affinities for h1Bx and h1By, separately. The specificity of h1Bx-pAb was further checked; it preferentially recognized subunits h1Bx and 1Bx13. HMW-GS gene coding sequences were amplified by genomic polymerase chain reaction from hybrid II-12. Two of the five amplicons, marked II2a and II31b, were sequenced. Their coding sequences are clustered to Glu-1Bx7 and Glu-1By9 of common wheat. Three discrepant regions in deduced amino acid sequences of II2a and 31b repeated one time more than Glu-1Bx7 and Glu-1By9. N-terminal sequences of h1Bx and h1By were determined, which were identical to the published sequences of 1Bx13 and 1By16 and in agreement with that deduced from II2a and II31b, respectively. These results indicated that the two novel genes separated from the hybrid wheat derived from the allelic variation of 1Bx7 and 1By9 of the parent wheat. There is an additional cysteine residue positioned at 271st amino acid of the mature peptide of II2a, which may be related to the high quality of the flour."

"12152348","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum is one of the most destructive diseases of wheat in areas where the weather is warm and humid after heading. Previous studies indicate that the level of resistance to FHB varies not only among wheat cultivars but also among some of their wild relatives. No accession, however, has yet been identified to be completely immune to FHB among the Gramineae. It is known that durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. conv. durum) is consistently more susceptible to FHB than common wheat (T. aestivum L.). The importance of the D genome in conferring resistance to FHB has been emphasized. Meanwhile, recent studies using molecular markers report effective QTLs on chromosome 3BS in a hexaploid population and on 3A in tetraploid recombinant inbred chromosome lines. In this study, we performed an evaluation of the effects of homoeologous group 3 chromosomes of T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides on resistance to FHB using a set of chromosome substitution lines of a durum wheat cultivar 'Langdon'. The accession of T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides examined in this study was more susceptible for Type II resistance (resistance to spread of FHB in the head) than 'Langdon'. Both of the chromosome substitution lines of 3A and 3B showed the same level of resistance with 'Langdon', but bleaching of the heads was completely prevented in the substitution lines of chromosome 3A without relationship to rachis fragility. It was concluded that the chromosome 3A of T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides carries resistance gene(s) to head bleaching caused by FHB."

"12734755","abstracttext","Gramineous plants, including the major agricultural crops wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rye (Secale cereale L.) and maize (Zea mays L.), accumulate benzoxazinones (Bxs) as defensive compounds. Previously, we isolated cDNAs of the Bx biosynthetic genes in wheat, TaBx2- TaBx5, that encode the enzymes catalyzing the sequential hydroxylation of indole to Bxs. In this study we isolated a cDNA of TaBx1, which encodes the first enzyme of the Bx pathway of wheat. The level of identity (80%) in deduced amino-acid sequence between TaBx1 and the corresponding maize gene Bx1 was as high as those shown between TaBx2- TaBx5 and the corresponding maize genes Bx2- Bx5, respectively. Southern blot analysis using the TaBx1- TaBx5 cDNAs as probes was conducted with aneuploid lines of hexaploid wheat in order to determine sub-chromosomal locations of the five Bx biosynthetic genes in Triticeae species. In wheat, TaBx1 and TaBx2 co-existed in specific regions of chromosomes 4A, 4B and 4D, and TaBx3- TaBx5 were localized together in the distal regions of the short arms of chromosomes 5A, 5B and 5D. TaBx3 and TaBx5 were found to have duplicated loci in the long arm and the short arm of chromosome 5B, respectively. In rye, homoeoloci of TaBx1 and TaBx2 were located on chromosome 7R and those for TaBx3- TaBx5 were located on chromosome 5R. In barley, no Southern blot band was detected with any of the probes under the highly stringent hybridization conditions, suggesting that the non-Bx phenotype of barley is attributable to the loss of Bx biosynthetic genes."

"18059549","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by the fungi Fusarium graminearum and Fusarium culmorum, is a worldwide disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The Chinese cultivar Ning 7840 is one of a few wheat cultivars with resistance to FHB. GeneCalling, an open-architecture mRNA-profiling technology, was used to identify differentially expressed genes induced or suppressed in spikes of Ning 7840 after infection by F. graminearum. One hundred and twenty-five cDNA fragments representing transcripts differentially expressed in wheat spikes were identified. Based on BLASTN and BLASTX analyses, putative functions were assigned to some of the genes: 28 were assigned functions in primary metabolism and photosynthesis, 7 were involved in defense response, 14 were involved in gene expression and regulation, 24 encoded proteins associated with structure and protein synthesis, 42 lacked homology to sequences in the database, and 3 were similar to cloned multidrug resistance or disease resistance proteins. Of particular interest in this study were genes associated with resistance and defense against pathogen infection. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR indicated that of 51 genes tested, 19 showed 2-fold or greater induction or suppression in infected Ning 7840 in comparison with the water-treated control. The remaining 32 genes were not significantly induced or suppressed in infected Ning 7840 compared with the control. Subsequently, these 19 induced or suppressed genes were examined in the wheat line KS24-1, containing FHB resistance derived from Lophopyrum elongatum, and Len, an FHB-susceptible wheat cultivar. The temporal expression of some of these sequences encoding resistance proteins or defense-related proteins showed FHB (resistance specific) induction, suggesting that these genes play a role in protection against toxic compounds in plant-fungus interactions. On the basis of comprehensive expression profiling of various biotic or abiotic stress response genes revealed by quantitative PCR in this study and other supporting data, we hypothesized that the plant-pathogen interactions may be highly integrated into a network of diverse biosynthetic pathways."

Large changes in transcript abundance were observed which were categorised into distinct phases of differentiation (6-10 daa), grain fill (12-21 daa) and desiccation/maturation (28-42 daa) and were associated with specific tissues and processes. A similar experiment on developing caryopses grown with dry and/or hot environmental treatments was also analysed, using the profiles established in the first experiment to show that most environmental treatment effects on transcription were due to acceleration of development, but that a few transcripts were specifically affected. Transcript abundance profiles in both experiments for nine selected known and putative wheat transcription factors were independently confirmed by real time RT-PCR. These expression profiles confirm or extend our knowledge of the roles of the known transcription factors and suggest roles for the unknown ones."

"16450171","articletitle","Cytotoxic thio-malate is transported by both an aluminum-responsive malate efflux pathway in wheat and the MAE1 malate permease in Schizosaccharomyces pombe."
"16450171","abstracttext","Aluminum (Al) tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is mainly achieved by malate efflux, which is regulated by the expression of the recently identified gene, presumably encoding an Al-activated malate efflux transporter (ALMT1). However, the transport mechanism is not fully understood, partly as a result of the rapid turnover of its substrate. We developed a tool to study malate transport in wheat by screening biological compounds using the well-characterized Schizosaccharomyces pombe malate transporter (SpMAE1). Expression of SpMAE1 in both S. pombe and Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which has no SpMAE1 homologue, caused hypersensitivity to thio-malic acid. This hypersensitivity was prominent at pH 3.5, but not pH 4.5, and was accompanied by an increase in thiol content, indicating that SpMAE1 mediates the uptake of thio-malic acid at a specific low pH. In wheat, root apices were able to accumulate thio-malic acid without growth reduction at pH values above 4.2. Pretreatment of root apices with thio-malic acid followed by Al treatment induced thio-malate efflux. Al-induced thio-malate efflux was much higher in Al-resistant cultivars/genotypes than in Al-sensitive ones, and was accompanied by a decrease in thiol-content. Thio-malate efflux in the Al-resistant cultivar was slightly activated by lanthanum or ytterbium ion. Thio-malic acid did not alleviate the Al-induced inhibition of root elongation in wheat. Taken together, our results suggest that thio-malate acts as an analogue for malate in malate transport systems in wheat and yeast, and that it may be a useful tool for the analysis of malate transport involved in Al-tolerance and of other organic ion transport processes."

"16593938","abstracttext","Several wheats (Triticum aestivum L. em Thell.) containing the short arm of chromosome 1R from rye (Secale cereale L.) translocated to the long arm of wheat chromosome 1B were examined, by in situ hybridization with a biotinylated probe, for the expression of rye rRNA genes located in the nucleolus-organizing region (NOR) present on the short arm of 1R. The wheats analyzed contain a reduced rye NOR band, identified by a C-banding technique, that was assumed to have resulted from a deletion that reduced the number of rRNA genes and spacer units. Genes being actively transcribed could be recognized as dispersed label on DNA within the nucleolus, while those genes that were inactive were seen as condensed label. After in situ hybridization with a biotinylated rye NOR spacer probe, no evidence of rye rRNA gene activity was detected in the plants containing a reduced rye NOR band. Biotin-labeling of chromosomes containing a normal-sized rye NOR locus showed a degree of rye activity consistent with the results of a previous study that used a radioactive probe detected by autoradiography. It was determined previously that rye rRNA genes in a wheat background show significantly less activity than in diploid rye because the spacer units between the rRNA genes of rye are smaller than those of wheat, and in cereals the ribosomal locus with the larger spacer unit is preferentially transcribed. The present results indicate that the number of spacer units is also important in determining which NOR locus (i.e., rye or wheat) will be expressed when several ribosomal loci are present in a wheat background."
"19011002","articletitle","Analysis of intraspecies diversity in wheat and barley genomes identifies breakpoints of ancient haplotypes and provides insight into the structure of diploid and hexaploid triticeae gene pools."
"19011002","abstracttext","A large number of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) varieties have evolved in agricultural ecosystems since domestication. Because of the large, repetitive genomes of these Triticeae crops, sequence information is limited and molecular differences between modern varieties are poorly understood. To study intraspecies genomic diversity, we compared large genomic sequences at the Lr34 locus of the wheat varieties Chinese Spring, Renan, and Glenlea, and diploid wheat Aegilops tauschii. Additionally, we compared the barley loci Vrs1 and Rym4 of the varieties Morex, Cebada Capa, and Haruna Nijo. Molecular dating showed that the wheat D genome haplotypes diverged only a few thousand years ago, while some barley and Ae. tauschii haplotypes diverged more than 500,000 years ago. This suggests gene flow from wild barley relatives after domestication, whereas this was rare or absent in the D genome of hexaploid wheat. In some segments, the compared haplotypes were very similar to each other, but for two varieties each at the Rym4 and Lr34 loci, sequence conservation showed a breakpoint that separates a highly conserved from a less conserved segment. We interpret this as recombination breakpoints of two ancient haplotypes, indicating that the Triticeae genomes are a heterogeneous and variable mosaic of haplotype fragments. Analysis of insertions and deletions showed that large events caused by transposable element insertions, illegitimate recombination, or unequal crossing over were relatively rare. Most insertions and deletions were small and caused by template slippage in short homopolymers of only a few base pairs in size. Such frequent polymorphisms could be exploited for future molecular marker development."

"17452751","abstracttext","Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase (CCR) is responsible for the CoA ester to aldehyde conversion in monolignol biosynthesis, which diverts phenylpropanoid-derived metabolites into the biosynthesis of lignin. To gain a better understanding of lignin biosynthesis and its biological function, a cDNA encoding CCR was identified from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and designated as Ta-CCR1. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Ta-CCR1 grouped together with other monocot CCR sequences while it diverged from Ta-CCR2. DNA gel-blot and mapping analyses demonstrated that Ta-CCR1 is present as a single copy gene in the wheat genome. Recombinant Ta-CCR1 protein converted feruloyl CoA, 5-OH-feruloyl CoA, sinapoyl CoA, and caffeoyl CoA, but feruloyl-CoA was the best substrate, suggesting the preferential biosynthesis of G-type lignin. RNA gel-blot analysis indicated that Ta-CCR1 was highly expressed in stem, with lower expression in leaves, and undetectable expression in roots. CCR enzyme activity was increased progressively along with the lignin biosynthesis and stem maturity. During stem development, Ta-CCR1 mRNA levels remained high at elongation, heading, and milky stages in the wheat H4564 cultivar, while they declined dramatically at the heading and milky stages in stems of the C6001 cultivar. Ta-CCR1 mRNA expression paralleled extractable CCR enzyme activity in these two cultivars. Furthermore, high Ta-CCR1 mRNA levels and high CCR enzyme activity in wheat stem were correlated with a higher Klason lignin content and greater stem mechanical strength in the H4564 cultivar. This suggests that Ta-CCR1 and its related CCR enzyme may be involved in the regulation of lignin biosynthesis during stem maturity and then contributes to stem strength support in wheat."

"16751439","abstracttext","The wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rye (Secale cereale) beta-D-glucosidases hydrolyze hydroxamic acid-glucose conjugates, exist as different types of isozyme, and function as oligomers. In this study, three cDNAs encoding beta-D-glucosidases (TaGlu1a, TaGlu1b, and TaGlu1c) were isolated from young wheat shoots. Although the TaGlu1s share very high sequence homology, the mRNA level of Taglu1c was much lower than the other two genes in 48- and 96-h-old wheat shoots. The expression ratio of each gene was different between two wheat cultivars. Recombinant TaGlu1b expressed in Escherichia coli was electrophoretically distinct fromTaGlu1a and TaGlu1c. Furthermore, coexpression of TaGlu1a and TaGlu1b gave seven bands on a native-PAGE gel, indicating the formation of both homo- and heterohexamers. One distinctive property of the wheat and rye glucosidases is that they function as hexamers but lose activity when dissociated into smaller oligomers or monomers. The crystal structure of hexameric TaGlu1b was determined at a resolution of 1.8 A. The N-terminal region was located at the dimer-dimer interface and plays a crucial role in hexamer formation. Mutational analyses revealed that the aromatic side chain at position 378, which is located at the entrance to the catalytic center, plays an important role in substrate binding. Additionally, serine-464 and leucine-465 of TaGlu1a were shown to be critical in the relative specificity for DIMBOA-glucose (2-O-beta-D-glucopyranosyl-4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-1,4-benzoxazin-3-one) over DIBOA-glucose (7-demethoxy-DIMBOA-glucose)."

Therefore, we investigated the infection strategy of the fungus on different floral organs of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under real time conditions by constitutive expression of the dsRed reporter gene in a TRI5prom::GFP mutant. Additionally, trichothecene induction during infection was visualised with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) coupled TRI5 promoter.

Recently, a new puroindoline gene, Puroindoline b-2 (Pin b-2), was identified. In this study, 388 wheat cultivars and advanced breeding lines from the U.S. Pacific Northwest were investigated for frequencies of Puroindoline D1 alleles and Pinb-2 variants 2 and 3. Results indicated that Pinb-D1b (74.0%) was the predominant genotype among hard wheats (N = 196), the only other hard allele encountered was Pina-D1b (26.0%). Across all varieties, Pinb-2v3 was the predominant genotype (84.5%) compared with Pinb-2v2 (15.5%). However, among 240 winter wheat varieties (124 soft white, 15 club, 68 hard red and 33 hard white varieties), all carried Pinb-2v3. Among spring wheats, Pinb-2v2 and Pinb-2v3 frequencies were more variable (soft white 25.0:75.0, hard red 58.2:41.8 and hard white 40.0:60.0, respectively). Kernel texture variation was analyzed using 247 of the 388 wheat varieties grown in multi-location factorial trials in up to 7 crop years. The range of variety means among the four groups, soft winter, soft spring, hard winter and hard spring, was on the order of 15-25 single kernel characterization system (SKCS) Hardness Index. The least significant difference for each of these trials ranged from 2.8 to 5.6 SKCS Hardness Index. Observations lead to the conclusion that Pinb-2 variants do not exert a prominent effect on kernel texture, however, Pinb-2 variants do identify features of wheat germ plasm structure in the U.S. Pacific Northwest."

"22515236","abstracttext_unlabelled","The effects of engineering higher levels of the High Molecular Weight Glutenin Dx5 subunit on starch characteristics in transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain were evaluated. This is important because of the interrelationship between starch and protein accumulation in grain, the strong biotechnological interest in modulating Dx5 levels and the increasing likelihood that transgenic wheat will be commercialized in the U.S. Unintended effects of Dx5 overexpression on starch could affect wheat marketability and therefore should be examined. Two controls with native levels of Dx5 were used: (i) the nontransformed Bobwhite cultivar, and (ii) a transgenic line (Bar-D) expressing a herbicide resistant (bar) gene, and they were compared with 2 transgenic lines (Dx5G and Dx5J) containing bar and additional copies of Dx5. There were few changes between Bar-D and Dx5G compared to Bobwhite. However, Dx5J, the line with the highest Dx5 protein (×3.5) accumulated 140% more hexose, 25% less starch and the starch had a higher frequency of longer amylopectin chains. These differences were not of sufficient magnitude to influence starch functionality, because granule morphology, crystallinity, amylose-to-amylopectin ratio, and the enthalpy of starch gelatinization and the amylose-lipid complex melting were similar to the control (P > 0.05). This overall similarity was borne out by Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Function Analysis, which could not distinguish among genotypes. Collectively our data imply that higher Dx5 can affect starch accumulation and some aspects of starch molecular structure but that the starches of the Dx5 transgenic wheat lines are substantially equivalent to the controls."

The cDNA of TaAGO1b is 3273 bp long and encodes 868 amino acids, with a predicted molecular weight of ~97.78 kDa and pI of 9.29. The 3157-bp TaAGO4 encodes 916 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 102.10 kDa and pI of 9.12. Genomics analysis showed that TaAGO1b and TaAGO4 contain 20 and 18 introns, respectively. Protein structural analysis demonstrated that typical PAZ and PIWI domains were found in both TaAGO1b and TaAGO4. From the highly conserved PIWI domains, we detected conserved Asp-Asp-His (DDH) motifs that function as a catalytic triad and have critical roles during the process of sequence-specific cleavage in the RNAi machinery. Structural modelling indicated that both TaAGOs can fold to a specific α/β structure. Moreover, the three aligned DDH residues are spatially close to each other at the ""slicer"" site of the PIWI domain. Expression analysis indicated that both genes are ubiquitously expressed in vegetative and reproductive organs, including the root, stem, leaf, anther, ovule, and seed. However, they are differentially expressed in germinating endosperm tissues. We were interested to learn that the two TaAGOs are also differentially expressed in developing wheat plants and that their expression patterns are variously affected by vernalization treatment. Further investigation revealed that they can be induced by cold accumulation during vernalization."
"23374504","abstracttext_conclusions","Two putative wheat Argonaute genes, TaAGO1b and TaAGO4, were cloned. Phylogenetic analysis, prediction of conserved domains and catalytic motifs, and modelling of their protein structures suggested that they encode functional Argonaute proteins. Temporal and spatial expression analyses indicated that these genes are potentially involved in developmental regulation of wheat plants."

"23426195","abstracttext","Root architecture traits are an important component for improving water stress adaptation. However, selection for aboveground traits under favorable environments in modern cultivars may have led to an inadvertent loss of genes and novel alleles beneficial for adapting to environments with limited water. In this study, we elucidate the physiological and molecular consequences of introgressing an alien chromosome segment (7DL) from a wild wheat relative species (Agropyron elongatum) into cultivated wheat (Triticum aestivum). The wheat translocation line had improved water stress adaptation and higher root and shoot biomass compared with the control genotypes, which showed significant drops in root and shoot biomass during stress. Enhanced access to water due to higher root biomass enabled the translocation line to maintain more favorable gas-exchange and carbon assimilation levels relative to the wild-type wheat genotypes during water stress. Transcriptome analysis identified candidate genes associated with root development. Two of these candidate genes mapped to the site of translocation on chromosome 7DL based on single-feature polymorphism analysis. A brassinosteroid signaling pathway was predicted to be involved in the novel root responses observed in the A. elongatum translocation line, based on the coexpression-based gene network generated by seeding the network with the candidate genes. We present an effective and highly integrated approach that combines root phenotyping, whole-plant physiology, and functional genomics to discover novel root traits and the underlying genes from a wild related species to improve drought adaptation in cultivated wheat."

"23881399","abstracttext","Wheat grain storage protein (GSP) content and composition are the main determinants of the end-use value of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain. The accumulation of glutenins and gliadins, the two main classes of GSP in wheat, is believed to be mainly controlled at the transcriptional level through a network of transcription factors. This regulation network could lead to stable cross-environment allometric scaling relationships between the quantity of GSP classes/subunits and the total quantity of nitrogen per grain. This work conducted a genetic mapping study of GSP content and composition and allometric scaling parameters of grain N allocation using a bread wheat worldwide core collection grown in three environments. The core collection was genotyped with 873 markers for genome-wide association and 167 single nucleotide polymorphism markers in 51 candidate genes for candidate association. The candidate genes included 35 transcription factors (TFs) expressed in grain. This work identified 74 loci associated with 38 variables, of which 19 were candidate genes or were tightly linked with candidate genes. Besides structural GSP genes, several loci putatively trans-regulating GSP accumulation were identified. Seven candidate TFs, including four wheat orthologues of barley TFs that control hordein gene expression, were associated or in strong linkage disequilibrium with markers associated with the composition or quantity of glutenin or gliadin, or allometric grain N allocation parameters, confirming the importance of the transcriptional control of GSP accumulation. Genome-wide association results suggest that the genes regulating glutenin and gliadin compositions are mostly distinct from each other and operate differently."

Numerous plant miRNAs have been identified. Evidence is increasing for their crucial roles during plant development. In the globally important crop of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the process by which grains are formed determines yield and end-use quality. However, little is known about miRNA-mediated developmental regulation of grain production. Here, we applied high-throughput sRNA sequencing and genome-wide mining to identify miRNAs potentially involved in the developmental regulation of wheat grains."

Through integrative analysis, we identified 605 miRNAs (representing 540 families) and found that 86 are possibly involved in the control of grain-filling. Additionally, 268 novel miRNAs (182 families) were identified, with 18 of them also potentially related to that maturation process. Our target predictions indicated that the 104 grain filling-associated miRNAs might target a set of wheat genes involved in various biological processes, including the metabolism of carbohydrates and proteins, transcription, cellular transport, cell organization and biogenesis, stress responses, signal transduction, and phytohormone signaling. Together, these results demonstrate that the developmental steps by which wheat grains are filled is correlated with miRNA-mediated gene regulatory networks."

"23992198","abstracttext","Plant height is an important agronomic trait. Dramatic increase in wheat yield during the ""green revolution"" is mainly due to the widespread utilization of the Reduced height (Rht)-1 gene. We analyzed the natural allelic variations of three homoeologous loci Rht-A1, Rht-B1, and Rht-D1 in Chinese wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) micro-core collections and the Rht-B1/D1 genotypes in over 1,500 bred cultivars and germplasms using a modified EcoTILLING. We identified six new Rht-A1 allelic variations (Rht-A1b-g), eight new Rht-B1 allelic variations (Rht-B1h-o), and six new Rht-D1 allelic variations (Rht-D1e-j). These allelic variations contain single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small insertions and deletions in the coding or uncoding regions, involving two frame-shift mutations and 15 missenses. Of which, Rht-D1e and Rht-D1h resulted in the loss of interactions of GID1-DELLA-GID2, Rht-B1i could increase plant height. We found that the Rht-B1h contains the same SNPs and 197 bp fragment insertion as reported in Rht-B1c. Further detection of Rht-B1h in Tibet wheat germplasms and wheat relatives indicated that Rht-B1c may originate from Rht-B1h. These results suggest rich genetic diversity at the Rht-1 loci and provide new resources for wheat breeding."

"24221254","abstracttext","Intergeneric hybridization between four common wheat cultivars, Triticum aestivum L. cultivars Chinese Spring, Norin 12, Norin 61, and Shinchunaga, and cultivated barley, Hordeum vulgare L. cultivars Betzes, Nyugoruden, Harunanijou, and Kinai 5 were carried out in a greenhouse under 15 - 20 °C and long-day (15 h) photoperiod conditions. Two days prior to pollination, a 100 mg/1 2,4-D solution was injected into wheat stems. Among wheat cultivars, Norin 12, Norin 61, and Shinchunaga showed higher crossabilities than that of Chinese Spring, suggesting the presence of crossability gene(s) other than the kr system of Chinese Spring. Variation was also found among the barley cultivars as male parents. Betzes barley showed the highest crossability with wheat. Thus, the cross Norin 12×Betzes showed the highest crossability (8.25%), followed by Norin 61 ×Betzes (6.04%), Shinchunaga×Betzes (5.00%), and Shinchunaga×Kinai 5 (5.00%). The embryos were rescued by culture at 15-20 days after pollination. Seventyfour plants were obtained from 82 embryos. The morphology of the hybrid plants resembled that of wheat parents. Among 60 seedlings observed, 28 had 28 chromosomes, 8 had 21, 23 had aneuploid numbers of chromosomes (22-27), and 1 had 29 chromosomes. About half of the aneuploid hybrids showed mosaicism for chromosome number. By analyzing five isozyme markers of barley chromosomes, the chromosome constitutions of the aneuploid hybrids were determined. Barley chromosomes 1 and 5 were found to be preferentially eliminated in the hybrids, while chromosomes 2 and 4 were eliminated infrequently. The conditions and genetic factors for high crossability and the tendency of barley chromosome elimination are discussed."

"24973883","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), predominantly caused by Fusarium graminearum, is a devastating disease that poses a serious threat to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production worldwide. A suppression subtractive hybridization cDNA library was constructed from F. graminearum infected spikes of a resistant Belgian winter wheat, Centenaire, exhibiting Type II resistance to FHB in order to identify differentially expressed members of full-size ABCG family. Members of the ABCG family are pleiotropic drug transporters allowing the movement of structurally unrelated metabolites, including pathogens-derived virulent compounds, across biological membranes and could be potentially involved in resistance to plant pathogens. In this study, five new full-size ABCG transporter expressed sequence tags TaABCG2, TaABCG3, TaABCG4, TaABCG5 and TaABCG6 have been identified. Time-course gene expression profiling between the FHB resistant Centenaire and the susceptible Robigus genotype showed that the newly isolated transcripts were differentially expressed up to 72 h-post inoculation. The respective genes encoding these transcripts were mapped to corresponding wheat chromosomes or chromosomal arms known to harbor quantitative trait loci for FHB resistance. Interestingly, these ABCG transcripts were also induced by deoxynivalenol (DON) treatment of germinating wheat seeds and the toxin treatment inhibited root and hypocotyl growth. However, the hypocotyl of the FHB resistant cultivar Centenaire was less affected than that of the susceptible cultivar Robigus, reflecting more likely the genotype-dependent differential expression pattern of the identified ABCG genes. This work emphasizes the potential involvement of ABCG transporters in wheat resistance to FHB, at least in part through the detoxification of the pathogen-produced DON."

The transcriptome profiles of seven putative differentially expressed defense-related genes were identified by SSH and further examined using qPCR. Fusarium head blight (FHB) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), caused by several species of the fungus fusarium, is important in all wheat growing regions worldwide. The most dominant species in Canada is Fusarium graminearum (Fg). F. graminearum isolates producing mycotoxins such as 3-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (3ADON) and 15-acetyl-deoxynivalenol (15ADON). The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the different chemotypes of Fg on the transcriptome pattern of expressed wheat genes. A cDNA library was constructed from infected ""Sumai 3"" spikes harvested at different times after inoculation with a macroconidia suspension. Employing suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), the subtracted cDNA library was differentially screened by dot-blot hybridization. Thirty-one clones were identified; one was isolated and characterized, and transcriptome profiling of seven up-regulated putative defense-related genes was performed using quantitative real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR. These genes may be involved in the wheat-pathogen interactions revealing transcript accumulation differences between the non-diseased, 3ADON-, and 15ADON-infected plants. Additionally, significant differences in gene expression were observed between 3ADON- and 15ADON-infected plants which highlight the significance of a particular chemotype in FHB disease."

"25596183","abstracttext","The hemibiotrophic fungus Zymoseptoria tritici causes Septoria tritici blotch disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Pathogen reproduction on wheat occurs without cell penetration, suggesting that dynamic and intimate intercellular communication occurs between fungus and plant throughout the disease cycle. We used deep RNA sequencing and metabolomics to investigate the physiology of plant and pathogen throughout an asexual reproductive cycle of Z. tritici on wheat leaves. Over 3,000 pathogen genes, more than 7,000 wheat genes, and more than 300 metabolites were differentially regulated. Intriguingly, individual fungal chromosomes contributed unequally to the overall gene expression changes. Early transcriptional down-regulation of putative host defense genes was detected in inoculated leaves. There was little evidence for fungal nutrient acquisition from the plant throughout symptomless colonization by Z. tritici, which may instead be utilizing lipid and fatty acid stores for growth. However, the fungus then subsequently manipulated specific plant carbohydrates, including fructan metabolites, during the switch to necrotrophic growth and reproduction. This switch coincided with increased expression of jasmonic acid biosynthesis genes and large-scale activation of other plant defense responses. Fungal genes encoding putative secondary metabolite clusters and secreted effector proteins were identified with distinct infection phase-specific expression patterns, although functional analysis suggested that many have overlapping/redundant functions in virulence. The pathogenic lifestyle of Z. tritici on wheat revealed through this study, involving initial defense suppression by a slow-growing extracellular and nutritionally limited pathogen followed by defense (hyper) activation during reproduction, reveals a subtle modification of the conceptual definition of hemibiotrophic plant infection."

In this study, the effects of NaCl (50-200 mM) on expression of high-affinity potassium transporters (HKTs), antioxidant enzymes and their isozyme profiles were investigated in two contrasting bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes viz., HD2329 (salt-sensitive) and Kharchia65 (salt-tolerant). Kharchia65 can successfully grow in salt affected soils, while HD2329 cannot tolerate salt stress. Differential expression studies of two HKT genes (TaHKT2;1.1 and TaHKT2;3.1) revealed their up-regulated expression (-1.5-fold) in the salt-sensitive HD2329 and down-regulated (-5-fold) inducible expression in the salt-tolerant genotype (Kharchia65). Specific activity of antioxidant enzymes, viz. superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) was found to be higher in the salt-tolerant genotype. Isozyme profile of two (POX and GR) antioxidant enzymes showed polymorphism between salt-tolerant and salt-sensitive genotypes. A new gene TaHKT2;3.1 was also identified and its expression profile and role in salt stress tolerance in wheat was also studied. Partial sequences of the TaHKT2;1.1 and TaHKT2;3.1 genes from bread wheat were submitted to the EMBL GenBank database. Our findings indicated that defence responses to salt stress were induced differentially in contrasting bread wheat genotypes which provide evidences for functional correlation between salt stress tolerance and differential biochemical and molecular expression patterns in bread wheat."

"26220082","abstracttext","Heterotrimeric nuclear factors Y (NF-Ys) are involved in regulation of various vital functions in all eukaryotic organisms. Although a number of NF-Y subunits have been characterized in model plants, only a few have been functionally evaluated in crops. In this work, a number of genes encoding NF-YB and NF-YC subunits were isolated from drought-tolerant wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. RAC875), and the impact of the overexpression of TaNF-YB4 in the Australian wheat cultivar Gladius was investigated. TaNF-YB4 was isolated as a result of two consecutive yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screens, where ZmNF-YB2a was used as a starting bait. A new NF-YC subunit, designated TaNF-YC15, was isolated in the first Y2H screen and used as bait in a second screen, which identified two wheat NF-YB subunits, TaNF-YB2 and TaNF-YB4. Three-dimensional modelling of a TaNF-YB2/TaNF-YC15 dimer revealed structural determinants that may underlie interaction selectivity. The TaNF-YB4 gene was placed under the control of the strong constitutive polyubiquitin promoter from maize and introduced into wheat by biolistic bombardment. The growth and yield components of several independent transgenic lines with up-regulated levels of TaNF-YB4 were evaluated under well-watered conditions (T1-T3 generations) and under mild drought (T2 generation). Analysis of T2 plants was performed in large deep containers in conditions close to field trials. Under optimal watering conditions, transgenic wheat plants produced significantly more spikes but other yield components did not change. This resulted in a 20-30% increased grain yield compared with untransformed control plants. Under water-limited conditions transgenic lines maintained parity in yield performance."

"27755583","abstracttext","Abscisic acid (ABA) is a well-characterized plant hormone, known to mediate developmental aspects as well as both abiotic and biotic stress responses. Notably, the exogenous application of ABA has recently been shown to increase susceptibility to the fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum, the causative agent of Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat and other cereals. However roles and mechanisms associated with ABA's modulation of pathogen responses remain enigmatic. Here the identification of putative ABA receptors from available genomic databases for Triticum aestivum (bread wheat) and Brachypodium distachyon (a model cereal) are reported. A number of these were cloned for recombinant expression and their functionality as ABA receptors confirmed by in vitro assays against protein phosphatases Type 2Cs. Ligand selectivity profiling of one of the wheat receptors (Ta_PYL2DS_FL) highlighted unique activities compared to Arabidopsis AtPYL5. Mutagenic analysis showed Ta_PYL2DS_FL amino acid D180 as being a critical contributor to this selectivity. Subsequently, a virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) approach was used to knockdown wheat Ta_PYL4AS_A (and similar) in planta, yielding plants with increased early stage resistance to FHB progression and decreased mycotoxin accumulation. Together these results confirm the existence of a family of ABA receptors in wheat and Brachypodium and present insight into factors modulating receptor function at the molecular level. That knockdown of Ta_PYL4AS_A (and similar) leads to early stage FHB resistance highlights novel targets for investigation in the future development of disease resistant crops."

"27551965","abstracttext","Understanding the radiosensitivity of plants, an important factor in crop mutation breeding programs, requires a thorough investigation of the factors that contribute to this trait. In this study, we used the highly radiosensitive wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety HY1 and J411, a γ-irradiation-insensitive control, which were screened from a natural population, to examine the factors affecting radiosensitivity, including free radical content and total antioxidant capacity, as well as the expression of TaKu70 and TaKu80 (DNA repair-related genes) as measured by real-time PCR. We also investigated the alternative splicing of this gene in the wild-type wheat ecotype by sequence analysis. Free radical contents and total antioxidant capacity significantly increased upon exposure of HY1 wheat to γ-irradiation in a dose-dependent manner. By contrast, in J411, the free radical contents exhibited a similar trend, but the total antioxidant capacity exhibited a downward trend upon increasing γ-irradiation. Additionally, we detected dose-dependent increases in TaKu70 and TaKu80 expression levels in γ-irradiated HY1, while in J411, TaKu70 expression levels increased, followed by a decline. We also detected alternative splicing of TaKu70 mRNA, namely, intron retention, in HY1 but not in J411. Our findings indicate that γ-irradiation induces oxidative stress and DNA damage in hexaploid wheat, resulting in growth retardation of seedlings, and they suggest that TaKu70 may play a causal role in radiosensitivity in HY1. Further studies are required to exploit these factors to improve radiosensitivity in other wheat varieties."

To confirm the function of TaFER-5B in wheat, TaFER-5B was transformed into the wheat cultivar Jimai5265 (JM5265), and the transgenic plants exhibited enhanced thermotolerance. To examine whether the function of ferritin from mono- and dico-species is conserved, TaFER-5B was transformed into Arabidopsis, and overexpression of TaFER-5B functionally complemented the heat stress-sensitive phenotype of a ferritin-lacking mutant of Arabidopsis. Moreover, TaFER-5B is essential for protecting cells against heat stress associated with protecting cells against ROS. In addition, TaFER-5B overexpression also enhanced drought, oxidative and excess iron stress tolerance associated with the ROS scavenging.

Identification of genes for adult-plant resistance (APR) to powdery mildew in Zhou8425B is of high importance for continued controlling the disease. In the current study, the high-density Illumina iSelect 90K single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array was used to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) for APR to powdery mildew in 244 recombinant inbred lines derived from the cross Zhou8425B/Chinese Spring. Inclusive composite interval mapping identified QTL on chromosomes 1B, 3B, 4B, and 7D, designated as QPm.caas-1BL.1, QPm.caas-3BS, QPm.caas-4BL.2, and QPm.caas-7DS, respectively. Resistance alleles at the QPm.caas-1BL.1, QPm.caas-3BS, and QPm.caas-4BL.2 loci were contributed by Zhou8425B, whereas that at QPm.caas-7DS was from Chinese Spring. QPm.caas-3BS, likely to be a new APR gene for powdery mildew resistance, was detected in all four environments. One SNP marker closely linked to QPm.caas-3BS was transferred into a semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR (STARP) marker and tested on 103 commercial wheat cultivars derived from Zhou8425B. Cultivars with the resistance allele at the QPm.caas-3BS locus had averaged maximum disease severity reduced by 5.3%.

By comparing the transcriptomes between Chinese Spring (CS, a common wheat variety) and the CS-Th. elongatum octoploid, 35,193 candidate SNPs between E genome genes and their common wheat orthologs were computed. Through comparative genomic analysis, these SNPs were putatively assigned to the seven individual E genome chromosomes. Among 420 randomly selected SNPs, 373 could be validated. Thus, approximately 89% of the mined SNPs may be authentic with respect to their polymorphism and chromosomal location. Using 14 such SNPs as molecular markers, complex E genome introgressions were reliably identified in 78 common wheat-Th. elongatum hybrids, and the structural feature of a novel recombinant chromosome formed by 6E and 7E was revealed. Finally, based on testing 33 SNPs assigned to chromosome 3E in multiple genotypes of Th. elongatum, Pseudoroegneria stipifolia (carrying the St genome related to E) and common wheat, we suggest that some of the SNP markers may also be applicable for genetic studies within and among the Thinopyrum species (populations) carrying E and/or St genomes in the future."

"28261230","abstracttext","RAR1 is a eukaryotic zinc-binding protein first identified as required for race-specific resistance to powdery mildew in barley. To study the function of TaRAR1 involvement in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) defense against the infection of stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), we identified and cloned three wheat homeologous genes highly similar to the barley HvRar1 , designated as TaRar1-2A, TaRar1-2B , and TaRar1-2D . The three TaRAR1 proteins all contain two conserved cysteine-and histidine-rich domains (CHORD-I and -II) shared by known RAR1-like proteins. Characterization of TaRar1 expression revealed that the expression was tissue-specific and up-regulated in wheat during stripe rust infection. Moreover, the transcription of TaRar1 was induced by methyl jasmonate, ethylene, and abscisic acid hormones. The same results were observed with drought and wound treatments. After TaRar1 was silenced in wheat cultivar Suwon11 containing the stripe rust resistance gene YrSu , the endogenous salicylic acid (SA) level, the hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) accumulation and the degree of hypersensitive response (HR) were significantly decreased, and the resistance to the avirulent pathotype of stripe rust was compromised. Meanwhile, the expression of catalase, an enzyme required for H 2 O 2 -scavenging, was up-regulated. Taken together, we concluded that TaRar1 is involved in wheat defense against stripe rust mediated by YrSu , and the defense was through SA to influence reactive oxygen species accumulation and HR."

"29075275","abstracttext","Aegilops caudata is an important gene source for wheat breeding. Intensive evaluation of its utilization value is an essential first step prior to its application in breeding. In this research, the agronomical and quality traits of Triticum aestivum - Ae. caudata additions B-G (homoeologous groups not identified) were analyzed and evaluated. Disease resistance tests showed that chromosome D of Ae. caudata might possess leaf rust resistance, and chromosome E might carry stem rust and powdery mildew resistance genes. Investigations into agronomical traits suggested that the introduction of the Ae. caudata chromosome in addition line F could reduce plant height. Grain quality tests showed that the introduction of chromosomes E or F into wheat could increase its protein and wet gluten content. Therefore, wheat- Ae. caudata additions D-F are all potentially useful candidates for chromosome engineering activities to create useful wheat-alien chromosome introgressions. A total of 55 EST-based molecular markers were developed and then used to identify the chromosome homoeologous group of each of the Ae. caudata B-G chromosomes. Marker analysis indicated that the Ae. caudata chromosomes in addition lines B to G were structurally altered, therefore, a large population combined with intensive screening pressure should be taken into consideration when inducing and screening for wheat- Ae. caudata compensating translocations. Marker data also indicated that the Ae. caudata chromosomes in addition lines C-F were 5C, 6C, 7C, and 3C, respectively, while the homoeologous group of chromosomes B and G of Ae. caudata are as yet undetermined and need further research."

In this study, we used the F 2 population derived from a cross between two wheat accessions displaying significant differences in SNPA to perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. Through bulked segregant analysis, a major and stable QTL that explained 18.11-82.11% of the phenotypic variation was identified on chromosome 4BS. The QTL interval was validated using F 4:5 and F 6:7 families and narrowed it to a 24.91-38.36 Mb region of chromosome 4BS according to the 'Chinese Spring' reference genome sequence. In this region, variations in 16 genes caused amino acid changes and three genes were present in only one parent. Among these, we annotated a gene orthologous to TB1 in maize (Zea mays), namely TraesCS4B01G042700, which carried a 44-bp deletion in its promoter in the higher-SNPA parent. An InDel marker based on the insertion/deletion polymorphism was designed and used to diagnose the allelic distribution within a natural population. The frequency of the 44-bp deletion allele associated with higher SNPA was relatively low (13.24%), implying that this favorable allele has not been widely utilized and could be valuable for wheat yield improvement. In summary, we identified a major and stable QTL for SNPA and developed a diagnostic marker for the more-spiked trait, which will be beneficial for molecular-assisted breeding in wheat."

"32587292","abstracttext","The objective of this work was to characterize the accumulation of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N), and the translocation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars to achieve both high-quality and high-yield. Twenty-four wheat cultivars, including 12 cultivars containing high-quality gluten subunit 5 + 10 at Glu-D1, and 12 cultivars with no Glu-D1 5 + 10, were planted at Yuanyang and Xuchang in Henan Province, during 2016-2017, and 2017-2018 cropping seasons. Wheat cultivars containing Glu-D1 5 + 10 had an advantage in grain quality traits. Significant difference (P < 0.05) was observed for grain protein concentration (GPC) between 5 + 10 group and no 5 + 10 group. Grain yield (GY) was significantly correlated with kernel number (KN) (r = 0.778, P < 0.01), thousand-kernel weight (TKW) (r = 0.559, P < 0.01), dry matter accumulation at post-anthesis (r = 0.443, P < 0.05), and stem water-soluble carbohydrate (WSC) accumulation (r = 0.487, P < 0.05) and translocation amount (r = 0.490, P < 0.05). GPC, dough stability time (DST) and nitrogen agronomic efficiency (NAE) were significantly correlated with nitrogen accumulation (NAA) at maturity stage (r = 0.524, = 0.404, = 0.418, P < 0.01, < 0.05, < 0.05, respectively), and nitrogen translocation amount (r = 0.512, = 0.471, = 0.405, P < 0.05, < 0.05, < 0.05, respectively). These results suggest that good-quality, high-yield, and high-efficiency could achieve through the selection of high-quality wheat cultivars and coordination of C and N accumulation and translocation. High-quality gluten subunit gene Glu-D1 5 + 10 and stem WSC could be used as a selection index for breeding and production of high-quality and high-yield wheat."

"30011945","abstracttext","An approach to manage seed-transmitted Fusarium crown-foot-root rot (FCR, Fusarium spp.) and common root rot (CRR, Bipolaris sorokiniana ) on wheat, avoiding environmental risks of chemicals, is seed treatments with microbial metabolites. F. sambucinum strain FS-94 that induces resistance to tomato wilt was shown by this study to be a source of non-fungitoxic wheat-protecting metabolites, which were contained in a mycelium extract purified by gel-chromatography and ultrafiltration. Plant-protecting effect of the purified mycelial extract (PME) was demonstrated in vegetation experiments using a rolled-towel assay and by small-plot field trials. To elucidate mechanisms putatively underlying PME protective activity, tests with cultured Triticum aestivum and T. kiharae cells, particularly the extracellular alkalinization assay, as well as gene expression analysis in germinated wheat seeds were used. Pre-inoculation treatments of seeds with PME significantly decreased the incidence (from 30 to 40%) and severity (from 37 to 50%) of root rots on seedlings without any inhibition of the seed germination and potentiation of deoxynivalenol (DON), DON monoacetylated derivatives and zearalenon production in FCR agents. In vegetation experiments, reductions in the DON production were observed with doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/mL of PME. Pre-sowing PME application on seeds of two spring wheat cultivars naturally infected with FCR and CRR provided the mitigation of both diseases under field conditions during four growing seasons (2013⁻2016). PME-induced ion exchange response in cultured wheat cells, their increased survivability, and up-regulated expression of some defensins' genes in PME-exposed seedlings allow the suggestion of the plant-mediated character of disease-controlling effect observed in field."

"30764284","abstracttext","Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. was observed during the 2007-2008 crop season in the state of Sonora, Mexico on previously resistant durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) cvs. Jupare C2001 (Lr27 + 31) and Banamichi C2004. Single uredinial isolates were made from disease samples collected in the field and tested mostly on 'Thatcher' differentials at seedling or adult-plant stages (1). The isolates were identified as a new race, BBG/BP, resembling race BBG/BN predominant on durum wheat (2), but with additional virulences to resistance genes Lr27 + Lr31 in Gatcher and adult-plant resistance gene Lr12. The new race was also identified in samples collected from durum wheat in the State of Nuevo Leon during the same season. The avirulence/virulence formula of race BBG/BP is Lr1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 3ka, 3bg, 9, 13, 14a, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22a, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32, 35, 37/Lr10, 11, 12, 14b, 20, 23, 27 + 31, 33. Although virulences to Lr27 + Lr31 and Lr12 is known to occur in P. triticina races predominant on bread wheat (T. aestivum L.) (1), to our knowledge, this is the first report of such virulences in the pathogen population on durum wheat. Pure isolates of race BBG/BP are stored in the CIMMYT leaf rust collection.

"30849854","abstracttext","Following the detection of Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici for the first time on wheat (Triticum aestivum) in the Western Cape in August 1996, stripe rust has spread to all the important wheat production areas in South Africa. Only the introduced pathotype (pt. 6E16) was detected in surveys of these areas during 1996 and 1997. In 1998, a severe stripe rust epidemic occurred in the eastern Free State on the extensively grown cultivars Hugenoot and Carina, both which are resistant to pt. 6E16. Stripe rust severities of 100% were common on flag and lower leaves, and widespread applications of fungicides were necessary. Avirulence/virulence characteristics of P. striifomis f. sp. tritici isolates collected from Hugenoot and Carina were determined on 17 standard stripe rust differential wheat lines and 11 supplementary testers. The latter testers included the wheat lines TP981 and TP1295 (supplied by R. Johnson, Cambridge, UK), both of which have a major resistance gene in common with the differentials Heines Peko, Reichersberg 42, Strubes Dickkopf, Clement, and Heines VII (1). Isolates obtained from Hugenoot and Carina differed from pt. 6E16 based on virulence to Reichersberg 42 (Yr7,25), Heines Peko (Yr2,6,25), TP981 (Yr25), and TP1295 (Yr25). The new variant, designated as 6E22, was also identified in collections from the province KwaZulu-Natal. Seedling tests with 6E16 and 6E22 have shown that Hugenoot, Carina, and Tugela-DN are the only local cultivars affected by the new pathotype. The occurrence of pt. 6E22, which appears to be a single-step adaptation from 6E16 adding virulence to Yr25, emphasizes the vulnerability of monogenic resistance to this disease. Reference: (1) R. A.

"30818353","articletitle","A large-scale pedigree resource of wheat reveals evidence for adaptation and selection by breeders."
"30818353","abstracttext","Information on crop pedigrees can be used to help maximise genetic gain in crop breeding and allow efficient management of genetic resources. We present a pedigree resource of 2,657 wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes originating from 38 countries, representing more than a century of breeding and variety development. Visualisation of the pedigree enables illustration of the key developments in United Kingdom wheat breeding, highlights the wide genetic background of the UK wheat gene pool, and facilitates tracing the origin of beneficial alleles. A relatively high correlation between pedigree- and marker-based kinship coefficients was found, which validated the pedigree and enabled identification of errors in the pedigree or marker data. Using simulations with a combination of pedigree and genotype data, we found evidence for significant effects of selection by breeders. Within crosses, genotypes are often more closely related than expected by simulations to one of the parents, which indicates selection for favourable alleles during the breeding process. Selection across the pedigree was demonstrated on a subset of the pedigree in which 110 genotyped varieties released before the year 2000 were used to simulate the distribution of marker alleles of 45 genotyped varieties released after the year 2000, in the absence of selection. Allelic diversity in the 45 varieties was found to deviate significantly from the simulated distributions at a number of loci, indicating regions under selection over this period. The identification of one of these regions as coinciding with a strong yield component quantitative trait locus (QTL) highlights both the potential of the remaining loci as wheat breeding targets for further investigation, as well as the utility of this pedigree-based methodology to identify important breeding targets in other crops. Further evidence for selection was found as greater linkage disequilibrium (LD) for observed versus simulated genotypes within all chromosomes. This difference was greater at shorter genetic distances, indicating that breeder selections have conserved beneficial linkage blocks. Collectively, this work highlights the benefits of generating detailed pedigree resources for crop species. The wheat pedigree database developed here represents a valuable community resource and will be updated as new varieties are released at https://www.niab.com/pages/id/501/UK_Wheat_varieties_Pedigree."
"29912979","articletitle","Evidence of cyclical light/dark-regulated expression of freezing tolerance in young winter wheat plants."
"29912979","abstracttext","The ability of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants to develop freezing tolerance through cold acclimation is a complex rait that responds to many environmental cues including day length and temperature. A large part of the freezing tolerance is conditioned by the C-repeat binding factor (CBF) gene regulon. We investigated whether the level of freezing tolerance of 12 winter wheat lines varied throughout the day and night in plants grown under a constant low temperature and a 12-hour photoperiod. Freezing tolerance was significantly greater (P<0.0001) when exposure to subfreezing temperatures began at the midpoint of the light period, or the midpoint of the dark period, compared to the end of either period, with an average of 21.3% improvement in survival. Thus, freezing survival was related to the photoperiod, but cycled from low, to high, to low within each 12-hour light period and within each 12-hour dark period, indicating ultradian cyclic variation of freezing tolerance. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of expression levels of CBF genes 14 and 15 indicated that expression of these two genes also varied cyclically, but essentially 180° out of phase with each other. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis (1H-NMR) showed that the chemical composition of the wheat plants' cellular fluid varied diurnally, with consistent separation of the light and dark phases of growth. A compound identified as glutamine was consistently found in greater concentration in a strongly freezing-tolerant wheat line, compared to moderately and poorly freezing-tolerant lines. The glutamine also varied in ultradian fashion in the freezing-tolerant wheat line, consistent with the ultradian variation in freezing tolerance, but did not vary in the less-tolerant lines. These results suggest at least two distinct signaling pathways, one conditioning freezing tolerance in the light, and one conditioning freezing tolerance in the dark; both are at least partially under the control of the CBF regulon."

"32339912","abstracttext","In plants, basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors (TFs) participate in various biological processes such as development and stress responses. But the molecular mechanism of wheat bZIP TFs modulating abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis is unknown. In this study, we demonstrated the expressions of three bZIP TF genes TabZIP8, 9, 13, were regulated by Triticum aestivum calcium (Ca 2+ )-dependent protein kinase 9-1 (TaCDPK9-1) and they took part in ABA biosynthesis in wheat roots under salt stress. We ﬁrst isolated TabZIP8, 9, 13 and TaCDPK9-1 from wheat. TabZIP8, 9, 13 genes transcripts were strongly induced by salt stress, but salt-induced TabZIP8, 9, 13 transcriptions were drastically impaired by Ca 2+ channel blocker LaCl 3 . TaCDPK9-1 kinase could interact with TabZIP8, 9, 13 TFs through yeast two-hybrid assay. Next, the expression levels of salt-induced wheat 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase1, 2 (TaNCED1,2) encoding a key enzyme controlling ABA production and salt-induced ABA content were found to be decreased under LaCl 3 treatment, and yeast one-hybrid experiment revealed TabZIP8, 9, 13 could bind to the ABA-responsive elements (ABREs) and the promoter sequence of TaNCED2 gene. Together, our results suggest that salt stress-induced ABA accumulation is mediated by TabZIP8, 9, 13, which are adjusted by TaCDPK9-1 in wheat roots."

Ectopic expression of TaARF4-A in arabidopsis was used to study its functions.

A dCAPS (derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence) marker developed from TaARF4-B was used to identify haplotypes and association analysis between haplotypes and agronomic traits."
"30590478","abstracttext_key results","TaARF4-A was constitutively expressed and its protein was localized in the nucleus. Ectopic expression of TaARF4-A in arabidopsis caused abscisic acid (ABA) insensitivity, shorter primary root length and reduced plant height (PH). Through expression studies and ChIP assays, TaARF4-A was shown to regulate HB33 expression which negatively responded to ABA, and reduced root length and plant height by repressing expression of Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3) genes that in turn upregulated indole-3-acetic acid content in arabidopsis. Association analysis showed that TaARF4-B was strongly associated with PH and root depth at the tillering, jointing and grain fill stages. Geographic distribution and allelic frequencies suggested that TaARF4-B haplotypes were selected in Chinese wheat breeding programmes. An amino acid change (threonine to alanine) at position 158 might be the cause of phenotype variation in accessions possessing different haplotypes."

"31865000","abstracttext","Several stressors like different types of heavy metals are found in the soil and can affect the growth and genomic integrity of wheat grains (Triticum aestivum L.). The aim of this study was to compare the effect of exogenous Cd (30, 60, 120 mg kg -1 ), Ni (50, 100 and 150 mg kg -1 ) or Pb (100, 200 and 300 mg kg -1 ) on wheat agronomic characteristics through the assessment of oxidative stress indices at protein and gene expression levels, photosynthetic pigments and genetic aberrations using RAPD analysis that were studied during two winter seasons (2015/2016 and 2016/2017). The results showed that all stressors significantly decreased the vegetative growth parameters, altered the activities of antioxidants enzymes in seedlings (after 30 days) and grains (after 5 months) and differently affected their expression levels in seedlings leaves and roots. Pb treated plants showed the poorest agronomic characteristics as it exhibited the worst affected wheat height, number of tillers, fresh and dry weight, flag leaf area as well as yield. Pb treatment caused poorest plant performance, it showed the highest proline content, least protein and chlorophyll contents, thus affects the overall plants growth followed by Cd and Ni, respectively. Furthermore, high Pb and Cd doses revealed highest degree of polymorphism and lowest degree of genome stability. Altogether, heavy metals accumulated mainly in wheat straw and induced genotoxic effect which consequently altered normal plant metabolism and pigment content which resulted in a significant reduction in wheat yield and quality. Moreover, Pb induced more genotoxic and phytotoxic effects than Cd and Ni."

"31915874","abstracttext_key message","Genetic mapping of sensitivity to the Pyrenophora tritici-repentis effector ToxB allowed development of a diagnostic genetic marker, and investigation of wheat pedigrees allowed transmission of sensitive alleles to be tracked. Tan spot, caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is a major disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Secretion of the P. tritici-repentis effector ToxB is thought to play a part in mediating infection, causing chlorosis of plant tissue. Here, genetic analysis using an association mapping panel (n = 480) and a multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population (n founders = 8, n progeny = 643) genotyped with a 90,000 feature single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array found ToxB sensitivity to be highly heritable (h 2  ≥ 0.9), controlled predominantly by the Tsc2 locus on chromosome 2B. Genetic mapping of Tsc2 delineated a 1921-kb interval containing 104 genes in the reference genome of ToxB-insensitive variety 'Chinese Spring'. This allowed development of a co-dominant genetic marker for Tsc2 allelic state, diagnostic for ToxB sensitivity in the association mapping panel. Phenotypic and genotypic analysis in a panel of wheat varieties post-dated the association mapping panel further supported the diagnostic nature of the marker. Combining ToxB phenotype and genotypic data with wheat pedigree datasets allowed historic sources of ToxB sensitivity to be tracked, finding the variety 'Maris Dove' to likely be the historic source of sensitive Tsc2 alleles in the wheat germplasm surveyed. Exploration of the Tsc2 region gene space in the ToxB-sensitive line 'Synthetic W7984' identified candidate genes for future investigation. Additionally, a minor ToxB sensitivity QTL was identified on chromosome 2A. The resources presented here will be of immediate use for marker-assisted selection for ToxB insensitivity and the development of germplasm with additional genetic recombination within the Tsc2 region."

"32917771","abstracttext","Two classes of premeiotic (21-nucleotides [nt]) and meiotic (24-nt) phased small interfering RNAs (phasiRNAs) and their patterns of accumulation have been described in maize ( Zea mays ) and rice ( Oryza sativa ) anthers. Their precise function remains unclear, but studies have shown that they support male fertility. The important role of phasiRNAs in anthers underpins our present study to characterize these small RNAs in wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) anthers. We staged anthers at every 0.2 mm of development for one wheat and two barley varieties. We isolated premeiotic (0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 mm), meiotic (0.8, 1.0, and 1.4 mm), and postmeiotic (1.8 mm) anthers, for which we then investigated accumulation patterns of RNAs, including reproductive phasiRNAs. We annotated a total of 12,821 and 2,897 PHAS loci in the wheat and barley genomes, respectively. By comparing the total number of PHAS loci in genomes of maize, rice, barley, and wheat, we identified an expansion of reproductive PHAS loci in the genomes of Poaceae subfamilies from Panicoideae to Oryzoideae and to Poideae. In addition to the two classes of premeiotic (21-nt) and meiotic (24-nt) phasiRNAs, previously described in maize and rice anthers, we characterized a group of 24-nt phasiRNAs that accumulate in premeiotic anthers. The absence of premeiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs in maize and rice suggests a divergence in grass species of the Poideae subfamily. Additionally, we performed a gene coexpression analysis describing the regulation of phasiRNA biogenesis in wheat and barley anthers. We highlight Argonaute 9 ( AGO9 ) and Argonaute 6 ( AGO6 ) as candidate binding partners of premeiotic and meiotic 24-nt phasiRNAs, respectively."

Furthermore, eight QTL were validated in a collected natural population. Soil salinity is one of the major abiotic stresses causing serious impact on crop growth, development and yield. As one of the three most important crops in the world, bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is severely affected by salinity, too. In this study, an F 7 recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between high-yield wheat cultivar Zhongmai 175 and salt-tolerant cultivar Xiaoyan 60 was constructed. The adult stage performances of the RIL population and their parent lines under low and high levels of salt stress were evaluated for three consecutive growing seasons. Utilizing a Wheat55K SNP array, a high-density genetic linkage map spinning 3250.71 cM was constructed. QTL mapping showed that 90 stable QTL for 15 traits were detected, and they were distributed on all wheat chromosomes except 4D, 6B and 7D. These QTL individually explained 2.34-32.43% of the phenotypic variation with LOD values ranging from 2.68 to 47.15. It was found that four QTL clusters were located on chromosomes 2D, 3D, 4B and 6A, respectively. Notably, eight QTL from the QTL clusters were validated in a collected natural population. Among them, QPh-4B was deduced to be an allele of Rht-B1. In addition, three kompetitive allele-specific PCR (KASP) markers derived from SNPs were successfully designed for three QTL clusters. This study provides an important base for salt-tolerant QTL (gene) cloning in wheat, and the markers, especially the KASP markers, will be useful for marker-assisted selection in salt-tolerant wheat breeding."

"9230898","abstracttext","Alloplasmic wheat. Triticum aestivum cv. Norin 26, with Aegilops crassa cytoplasm, shows photoperiod-sensitive cytoplasmic male sterility (PCMS). This alloplasmic line expresses pistillody of anthers only when grown in long-day conditions (> 15 h light). To assess the molecular basis of the PCMS, we carried out Southern and Northern hybridization analyses on mitochondrial DNAs and RNAs isolated from seedlings of alloplasmic lines showing various PCMS phenotypes using probes for twelve mitochondrial genes. All RFLP patterns of mitochondrial DNA from alloplasmic lines greatly differed from those of common wheat, and were slightly changed from those of the parental species, i.e., Ae. crassa. This indicates that nuclear substitutions between related plant species induce structural alterations in the mitochondrial genome. Furthermore, RFLP patterns of (cr)-N61 and FR-mutant probed with coxIII and orf25 were identical with each other, but different from those of the other alloplasmic lines, indicating that the nuclei of N61 and FR-mutant harbor some gene(s) that induces structural alterations of the mitochondrial genome in the coxIII and orf25 regions. The transcription patterns of atp6 and cob in Ae. crassa type were different from those of T. aestivum type. Furthermore, the orf25 transcript in alloplasmic wheats was about 300 nucleotides longer than that of euplasmic lines, including the Ae. crassa pure line, suggesting that transcription patterns of orf25 are associated with recovery from the PCMS phenomenon. These data clearly show the mutual cross-talk between the nuclear genome and chondriome. These observations raise the possibility that the dysfunction of mitochondria caused by the failure of a cooperative control of mitochondrial gene(s) expression influences the pathway of flower morphogenesis, especially in the process that determines organ identity."

Actinobacteria with their sporulation, nutrient cycling, root colonization, bio-control and other plant-growth-promoting activities could be potential field bio-inoculants. We report the isolation of five rhizospheric and two root endophytic actinobacteria from Triticum aestivum (wheat) plants. The cultures exhibited plant-growth-promoting activities, namely phosphate solubilization (1916 mg l(-1)), phytase (0.68 U ml(-1)), chitinase (6.2 U ml(-1)), indole-3-acetic acid (136.5 mg l(-1)) and siderophore (47.4 mg l(-1)) production, as well as utilizing all the rhizospheric sugars under test. Malate (50-55 mmol l(-1)) was estimated in the culture supernatant of the highest phosphate solublizer, Streptomyces mhcr0816. The mechanism of malate overproduction was studied by gene expression and assays of key glyoxalate cycle enzymes - isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), isocitrate lyase (ICL) and malate synthase (MS). The significant increase in gene expression (ICL fourfold, MS sixfold) and enzyme activity (ICL fourfold, MS tenfold) of ICL and MS during stationary phase resulted in malate production as indicated by lowered pH (2.9) and HPLC analysis (retention time 13.1 min). Similarly, the secondary metabolites for chitinase-independent biocontrol activity of Streptomyces mhcr0817, as identified by GC-MS and (1)H-NMR spectra, were isoforms of pyrrole derivatives. The inoculation of actinobacterial isolate mhce0811 in T. aestivum (wheat) significantly improved plant growth, biomass (33%) and mineral (Fe, Mn, P) content in non-axenic conditions. Thus the actinobacterial isolates reported here were efficient PGPR possessing significant antifungal activity and may have potential field applications."

The development and registration of two donor lines, one tetraploid ( Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum ; PI 656793) and one hexaploid ( T. aestivum L. ssp. aestivum ; PI 664549), each carrying the resistant wild emmer ( T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides ) allele for Yr36 linked with the non-functional Gpc-B1 allele, are intended to overcome this potential limitation. Meiotic recombination events breaking the linkage between these two genes were discovered during the systematic screening of a population of 4,500 F 2 durum plants (cv. Langdon background) used to fine map Yr36 . One of the critical recombination events was selected for fixation by self-pollination and transferred to a California adapted spring hexaploid background (breeding line UC1110 5+10 ) through five generations of backcrossing. Genotypic and phenotypic data confirm the presence of Yr36 and the non-functional Gpc-B1 allele in both registered lines."

The gene, cys1, encoding this enzyme was isolated from a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cDNA library, and its deduced amino acid sequence found to show 53% sequence identity with the O-acetyl-serine (thiol) lyase of Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. The deduced peptide consists of 325 amino acids (34.1 kDa), contains a conserved motif for the binding of pyridoxal phosphate, a co-factor required for enzymatic activity, and an N-terminal region of 37 amino acid residues resembling chloroplast transit peptides. The identity of cys1 was further demonstrated through complementation of an E. coli cysteine auxotroph, which lacks O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase, by expression of the wheat gene. Northern blot analysis showed that cys1 is highly expressed in green vegetative and reproductive tissues and in the roots of wheat, as well as in the leaves of several plant species. Southern blot analysis demonstrated that the gene exists as a single copy in the wheat genome. Tobacco plants transformed with cys1 in the sense orientation (sense plants) or antisense orientation (antisense plants), under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter, showed high levels of transcripts. The O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase activity in transgenic plants was determined, and found to be three- to fivefold higher in sense plants than in control plants, but unaffected in antisense transformants. Fumigation experiments with toxic levels of hydrogen sulphide (H2S) gas showed that while sense transformants were highly resistant, control and antisense plants were severely damaged by the treatment."

"9276954","abstracttext","A cDNA library made from mRNA of Al-treated roots of an Al-sensitive wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Victory) cultivar was screened with a degenerate oligonucleotide probe derived from the partial amino acid sequence of the Al-induced protein TAI-18. Of seven clones that initially hybridized with the probe, one encoded a novel 1,3-beta-glucanase having a calculated molecular weight of 46.3 and an isoelectric point of 6.0. Like the A6 1,3-beta-glucanase gene products from Brassica napus and Arabidopsis thaliana, the predicted wheat protein had a C-terminal extension with three potential glycosylation sites. Northern analysis revealed that wheat 1,3-beta-glucanase mRNA was up-regulated in Al-intoxicated roots, with highest expression after 12 h. The antibody to A6 1,3-beta-glucanase from B. napus cross-reacted with a 56-kD protein that was induced after 24 h. A second partial cDNA clone showed similarity to genes encoding cytoskeletal fimbrin-like (actin-bundling) proteins. Although well studied in animals and fungi, fimbrins have not previously been described in plants. Fimbrin-like transcripts were up-regulated after 24 h of Al treatment in the Al-sensitive wheat cv Victory. In the Al-tolerant cv Atlas 66, fimbrin-like mRNA was up-regulated within 12 h by Al concentrations that did not inhibit root growth. Cellular stress associated with Al toxicity therefore causes up-regulation of a defense-related gene and a gene involved in the maintenance of cytoskeletal function."

"11756260","abstracttext","The development of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars that are resistant to Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV), yet competitive in yield under nondiseased conditions, is an objective for breeding programs in the Great Plains. This field study was conducted to compare classical and transgenic sources of resistance to WSMV. Three sets of germplasm were evaluated. These included adapted cultivars with various levels of tolerance, transgenic wheat lines containing viral coat protein or replicase sequences from WSMV that showed resistance in greenhouse trials, and germplasm with resistance to WSMV due to a translocated segment of chromosome 4Ai-2 from Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth and Dewey containing Wsm1. A replicated field trial was conducted at Bozeman, MT, over a two-year period to evaluate the effectiveness of these different sources of resistance to mechanical inoculation of WSMV. Adapted cultivars differed in their ability to tolerate WSMV with mean reductions in yield over the two years ranging from 41 to 74%. Incorporation of the replicase or coat protein gene from WSMV did not provide field resistance to viral infection and in general, transgenic lines yielded less than their parent cultivar, 'Hi-Line'. Wheat-Thinopyrum lines positive for a DNA marker linked to the Wsm1 gene had significantly reduced yield losses ranging from 5 to 39% compared with yield losses of 57 to 88% in near isogenic lines not having the Wsm1 gene. Yield of lines with Wsm1 in the absence of disease ranged from 11 to 28% less than yield of lines without Wsm1. Our results suggest Wsm1 provides the best source of WSMV resistance but a yield penalty may exist because of the presence of the translocation."
"12428011","articletitle","Characterization of the genes encoding the cytosolic and plastidial forms of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase in wheat endosperm."
"12428011","abstracttext","In most species, the synthesis of ADP-glucose (Glc) by the enzyme ADP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (AGPase) occurs entirely within the plastids in all tissues so far examined. However, in the endosperm of many, if not all grasses, a second form of AGPase synthesizes ADP-Glc outside the plastid, presumably in the cytosol. In this paper, we show that in the endosperm of wheat (Triticum aestivum), the cytosolic form accounts for most of the AGPase activity. Using a combination of molecular and biochemical approaches to identify the cytosolic and plastidial protein components of wheat endosperm AGPase we show that the large and small subunits of the cytosolic enzyme are encoded by genes previously thought to encode plastidial subunits, and that a gene, Ta.AGP.S.1, which encodes the small subunit of the cytosolic form of AGPase, also gives rise to a second transcript by the use of an alternate first exon. This second transcript encodes an AGPase small subunit with a transit peptide. However, we could not find a plastidial small subunit protein corresponding to this transcript. The protein sequence of the purified plastidial small subunit does not match precisely to that encoded by Ta.AGP.S.1 or to the predicted sequences of any other known gene from wheat or barley (Hordeum vulgare). Instead, the protein sequence is most similar to those of the plastidial small subunits from chickpea (Cicer arietinum) and maize (Zea mays) and rice (Oryza sativa) seeds. These data suggest that the gene encoding the major plastidial small subunit of AGPase in wheat endosperm has yet to be identified."
"18622733","articletitle","Heterologous expression of a plastid EF-Tu reduces protein thermal aggregation and enhances CO2 fixation in wheat (Triticum aestivum) following heat stress."
"18622733","abstracttext","Heat stress is a major constraint to wheat production and negatively impacts grain quality, causing tremendous economic losses, and may become a more troublesome factor due to global warming. At the cellular level, heat stress causes denaturation and aggregation of proteins and injury to membranes leading to alterations in metabolic fluxes. Protein aggregation is irreversible, and protection of proteins from thermal aggregation is a strategy a cell uses to tolerate heat stress. Here we report on the development of transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum) events, expressing a maize gene coding for plastidal protein synthesis elongation factor (EF-Tu), which, compared to non-transgenic plants, display reduced thermal aggregation of leaf proteins, reduced heat injury to photosynthetic membranes (thylakoids), and enhanced rate of CO(2) fixation after exposure to heat stress. The results support the concept that EF-Tu ameliorates negative effects of heat stress by acting as a molecular chaperone. This is the first demonstration of the introduction of a plastidal EF-Tu in plants that leads to protection against heat injury and enhanced photosynthesis after heat stress. This is also the first demonstration that a gene other than HSP gene can be used for improvement of heat tolerance and that the improvement is possible in a species that has a complex genome, hexaploid wheat. The results strongly suggest that heat tolerance of wheat, and possibly other crop plants, can be improved by modulating expression of plastidal EF-Tu and/or by selection of genotypes with increased endogenous levels of this protein."

"23602379","abstracttext","The molecular response of plants to abiotic stresses has been considered a process mainly involved in the modulation of transcriptional activity of stress-related genes. Nevertheless, recent findings have suggested new layers of regulation and complexity. Upstream molecular mechanisms are involved in the plant response to abiotic stress. Plants gain resistance to abiotic stress by reprogramming metabolism and gene expression. GABA is proposed to be a signaling molecule involved in nitrogen metabolism, regulating the cytosolic pH, and protection against oxidative damage in response to various abiotic stresses. The aim of our study was to examine the role of the GABA shunt pathway-specific response in five wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars (Hurani 75, Sham I, Acsad 65, Um Qayes and Nodsieh) to salt and osmotic stress in terms of seed germination, seedling growth, oxidative damage (malondialdehyde (MDA) accumulation), and characterization of the glutamate decarboxylse gene (GAD) m-RNA level were determined using RT-PCR techniques. Our data showed a marked increase in GABA, MDA and GAD m-RNA levels under salt and osmotic stress in the five wheat cultivars. Um Qayes cultivar showed the highest germination percentage, GABA accumulation, and MDA level under salt and osmotic stresses. The marked increase in GAD gene expression explains the high accumulation of the GABA level under both stresses. Our results indicated that the GABA shunt is a key signaling and metabolic pathway that allows wheat to adapt to salt and osmotic stress. Based on our data, the Um Qayes wheat cultivar is the cultivar most recommended to be grown in soil with high salt and osmotic contents."

"22609418","abstracttext","The interaction between Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) involves a gene-for-gene resistance mechanism. The incompatible interaction leading to resistance involves up-regulation of several Hfr (Hessian fly responsive) genes encoding proteins with potential insecticidal activity. The encoded proteins HFR-1, HFR-2 and HFR-3 all possess lectin-like domains. HFR-1 and HFR-3 were produced as recombinant proteins using Escherichia coli and Pichia pastoris, respectively as expression hosts. Purified recombinant proteins were assayed for insecticidal effects towards cereal aphid (Sitobion avenae), an insect to which wheat shows only tolerance. Both HFR-1 and HFR-3 were found to be insecticidal towards S. avenae when fed in artificial diet. Although HFR-3 has sequence similarity and similar chitin-binding activity to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA), the latter protein was almost non-toxic to S. avenae. HFR-3 binds strongly to aphid midguts after ingestion, whereas WGA binds but does not persist over a feed-chase period. Quantitative PCR showed that Hfr-3 mRNA does not increase in level after cereal aphid infestation. The results suggest that the lack of effective resistance to cereal aphid in wheat is not due to an absence of genes encoding suitable insecticidal proteins, but results from a failure to up-regulate gene expression in response to aphid attack."

Wheat powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is a devastating disease that can cause severe yield losses. Chinese wheat landrace Hulutou confers nearly immune resistance against prevailing Bgt isolate E09 in Beijing. Genetic analysis indicate that the powdery mildew resistance of Hulutou is controlled by a single dominant gene, provisionally designated MlHLT. Bulked segregant analysis(BSA) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) mapping showed that MlHLT is located on chromosome arm 1DS between markers Xgwm337 and Xcfd83/Xcfd72. By applying comparative genomics analysis, collinearity genomic regions of the MlHLT locus on Aegilops tauschii chromosome 1DS were identified in Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 2, rice chromosome 5 and sorghum chromosome 9, respectively. Three new polymorphic markers were developed using the draft genome sequences and the extended single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker sequences of Ae. tauschii accession AL8/78, as well as the Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring 454 contig sequences and the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) survey sequences. MlHLT mapped into a 3.6 cM genetic interval spanning 13.4 Mb physical genomic region containing seven contigs (ctg220, ctg4623, ctg1063, ctg5929, ctg3163, ctg699 and ctg1065) on 1DS that has synteny with a 369.8 kb genomic region in Brachypodium, a 380.8 kb genomic region in rice and a 298.4 kb genomic region in sorghum.

"25870921","abstracttext","This study reports the identification of a new gene conferring resistance to the Ug99 lineage of races of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Because the virulent races of stem rust pathogen continue to pose a serious threat in global wheat production, identification and molecular characterization of new resistance genes remains of utmost important to enhance resistance diversity and durability in wheat germplasm. Advanced wheat breeding line 'ND643/2*Weebill1' carries a stem rust resistance gene, temporarily designated as SrND643, effective against the Ug99 group of P. graminis f. sp. tritici races at both seedling and adult growth stages. This study was conducted to map the chromosomal location of SrND643 and identify closely linked molecular markers to allow its selection in breeding populations. In total, 123 recombinant inbred lines, developed by crossing ND643/2*Weebill1 with susceptible line 'Cacuke', were evaluated for stem rust response in field nurseries at Njoro, Kenya, during two growing seasons in 2010, and were genotyped with DNA markers, including Diversity Arrays Technology, simple sequence repeats (SSR), and single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Linkage mapping tagged SrND643 at the distal end of chromosome 4AL, showing close association with SSR markers Xgwm350 (0.5 centimorgans [cM]), Xwmc219 (4.1 cM), and Xwmc776 (2.9 cM). The race specificity of SrND643 is different from that of Sr7a and Sr7b, indicating that the resistance is conferred by a gene at a new locus or by a new allele of Sr7. The flanking markers Xgwm350 and Xwmc219 were predictive of the presence of SrND643 in advanced germplasm, thus validating the map location and their use in marker-assisted selection."

We previously identified a major quantitative trait locus QPH.caas-6A flanked by simple sequence repeat markers Xbarc103 and Xwmc256 that reduced height by 8.0-10.4%. Here QPH.caas-6A , designated as Rht24 , was confirmed using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a Jingdong 8/Aikang 58 cross. The target sequences of Xbarc103 and Xwmc256 were used as queries to BLAST against International Wheat Genome Sequence Consortium database and hit a super scaffold of approximately 208 Mb. Based on gene annotation of the scaffold, three gene-specific markers were developed to genotype the RILs, and Rht24 was narrowed to a 1.85 cM interval between TaAP2 and TaFAR . In addition, three single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers linked to Rht24 were identified from SNP chip-based screening in combination with bulked segregant analysis. The allelic efficacy of Rht24 was validated in 242 elite wheat varieties using TaAP2 and TaFAR markers. These showed a significant association between genotypes and plant height. Rht24 reduced plant height by an average of 6.0-7.9 cm across environments and were significantly associated with an increased TGW of 2.0-3.4 g. The findings indicate that Rht24 is a common dwarfing gene in wheat breeding, and TaAP2 and TaFAR can be used for marker-assisted selection."

"30754257","abstracttext","Tan spot, caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an important foliar disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. In a preliminary study, P. tritici-repentis isolates from Arkansas were shown to vary in virulence relative to isolates from other regions of the United States. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to characterize both pathogenic and molecular variations in P. tritici-repentis isolates from Arkansas. The virulence of 93 isolates of P. tritici-repentis was evaluated by inoculating five differential wheat cultivars/lines. Based on virulence phenotypes, 63 isolates were classified as race 1, and 30 isolates were assigned to race 3. A subset of 42 isolates was selected for molecular characterization with the presence or absence of the ToxA and ToxB genes. The results showed that 36 isolates out of 42 tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Southern analysis lacked the ToxA and ToxB genes. Six isolates harboring the ToxA and ToxB genes induced necrosis and chlorosis on Glenlea and 6B365, respectively. Thirteen ToxA gene-deficient isolates also caused necrosis and chlorosis on Glenlea and 6B365, respectively; however, they did not fit current race classification. In contrast, the remaining 23 ToxA gene-deficient isolates did not cause necrosis, but induced chlorosis on 6B365, showing a disease profile for race 3. When the virulence of AR LonB2 (an isolate with unclassified race) was compared with known races 1, 3, and 5 of P. tritici-repentis on 20 winter wheat cultivars from Arkansas, the virulence phenotypes differed substantially. Taken together, the ToxA and ToxB gene-deficient isolates of P. tritici-repentis that induce necrosis and/or chlorosis may produce a novel toxin(s) on wheat."

The GDP-L-galactose phosphorylase (GGP) gene encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of the L-galactose pathway-the dominant ascorbate biosynthetic pathway in plants-and is a promising gene candidate for increasing ascorbate in crops. In addition to transcriptional regulation, GGP production is regulated at the translational level through an upstream open reading frame (uORF) in the long 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR). The GGP genes have yet to be identified in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), one of the most important food grain sources for humans."
"31771507","abstracttext_results","Bread wheat chromosomal groups 4 and 5 were found to each contain three homoeologous TaGGP genes on the A, B, and D subgenomes (TaGGP2-A/B/D and TaGGP1-A/B/D, respectively) and a highly conserved uORF was present in the long 5'UTR of all six genes. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that the TaGGP genes separate into two distinct groups and identified a duplication event of the GGP gene in the ancestor of the Brachypodium/Triticeae lineage. A microsynteny analysis revealed that the TaGGP1 and TaGGP2 subchromosomal regions have no shared synteny suggesting that TaGGP2 may have been duplicated via a transposable element. The two groups of TaGGP genes have distinct expression patterns with the TaGGP1 homoeologs broadly expressed across different tissues and developmental stages and the TaGGP2 homoeologs highly expressed in anthers. Transient transformation of the TaGGP coding sequences in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf tissue increased ascorbate concentrations more than five-fold, confirming their functional role in ascorbate biosynthesis in planta."

Transient transformation of the TaGGP coding sequences in N. benthamiana demonstrated their activity in planta. The six TaGGP genes and uORFs identified in this study provide a valuable genetic resource for increasing ascorbate concentrations in bread wheat."

"31587088","abstracttext_key message","A cytological map of Haynaldia villosa chromosome arm 4VS was constructed to facilitate the identification and utilization of beneficial genes on 4VS. Induction of wheat-alien chromosomal structure aberrations not only provides new germplasm for wheat improvement, but also allows assignment of favorable genes to define physical regions. Especially, the translocation or introgression lines carrying alien chromosomal fragments with different sizes are useful for breeding and alien gene mapping. Chromosome arm 4VS of Haynaldia villosa (L.) Schur (syn. Dasypyrum villosum (L.) P. Candargy) confers resistances to eyespot and wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV). In this research, we used both irradiation and the pairing homoeologous gene (Ph) mutant to induce chromosomal aberrations or translocations. By using the two approaches, a structural aberration library of chromosome arm 4VS was constructed. In this library, there are 57 homozygous structural aberrations, in which, 39 were induced by the Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS) ph1b mutant (CS ph1b) and 18 were induced by irradiation. The aberrations included four types, i.e., terminal translocation, interstitial translocation, deletion and complex structural aberration. The 4VS cytological map was constructed by amplification in the developed homozygous aberrations using 199 4VS-specific markers, which could be allocated into 39 bins on 4VS. These bins were further assigned to their corresponding physical regions of chromosome arm 4DS based on BLASTn search of the marker sequences against the reference sequence of Aegilops tauschii Cosson. The developed genetic stocks and cytological map provide genetic stocks for wheat breeding as well as alien gene tagging."

The IWGSC recently published a reference genome and associated annotation (IWGSC CS v1.0, Chinese Spring) that has been widely adopted and utilized by the wheat community. Although this reference assembly represents all three wheat subgenomes at chromosome-scale, it was derived from short reads, and thus is missing a substantial portion of the expected 16 Gbp of genomic sequence. We earlier published an independent wheat assembly (Triticum_aestivum_3.1, Chinese Spring) that came much closer in length to the expected genome size, although it was only a contig-level assembly lacking gene annotations. Here, we describe a reference-guided effort to scaffold those contigs into chromosome-length pseudomolecules, add in any missing sequence that was unique to the IWGSC CS v1.0 assembly, and annotate the resulting pseudomolecules with genes. Our updated assembly, Triticum_aestivum_4.0, contains 15.07 Gbp of nongap sequence anchored to chromosomes, which is 1.2 Gbps more than the previous reference assembly. It includes 108,639 genes unambiguously localized to chromosomes, including over 2000 genes that were previously unplaced.

"18155625","abstracttext","Chike (accession number Su1900), a Chinese native wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety, is resistant to the currently prevailing physiological races of Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici in China. Genetic analysis indicated that resistance to the physiological race CY32 of the pathogen in the variety was controlled by one dominant gene. In this study, BSA (bulked segregant analysis) methods and SSRs (simple sequence repeats) marker polymorphic analysis are used to map the gene. The resistant and susceptible DNA bulks were prepared from the segregating F2 population of the cross between Taichung 29, a susceptible variety as maternal parent, and Chike as paternal parent. Over 400 SSR primers were screened, and five SSR markers Xwmc44, Xgwm259, Xwmc367, Xcfa2292, and Xbarc80 on the chromosome arm 1BL were found to be polymorphic between the resistant and the susceptible DNA bulks as well as their parents. Genetic linkage was tested on segregating F2 population with 200 plants, including 140 resistant and 60 susceptible plants. All the five SSR markers were linked to the stripe rust resistance gene in Chike. The genetic distances for the markers Xwmc44, Xgwm259, Xwmc367, Xcfa2292, and Xbarc80 to the target gene were 8.3 cM, 9.1 cM, 17.2 cM, 20.6 cM, and 31.6 cM, respectively. Analysis using 21 nulli-tetrasomic Chinese Spring lines further confirmed that all the five markers were located on chromosome 1B. On the basis of the above results, it is reasonable to assume that the major stripe rust resistance gene YrChk in Chike was located on the chromosome arm 1BL, and its comparison with the other stripe rust resistance genes located on 1B suggested that YrChk may be a novel gene that provides the resistance against stripe rust in Chike. Exploration and utilization of resources of disease resistance genes in native wheat varieties will be helpful both to diversify the resistance genes and to amend the situation of resistance gene simplification in the commercial wheat cultivars in China."

Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. (Pt), is a broadly distributed and economically important disease of wheat. Deploying cultivars carrying effective leaf rust resistance (Lr) genes is a desirable method of disease control. KU3198 is a common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) accession from the Kyoto collection that was highly resistant to Pt in Canada. An F2 population from the cross HY644/KU3198 showed segregation for two dominant Lr genes when tested with Pt race MBDS which was virulent on HY644. Multiple bulk segregant analysis (MBSA) was employed to find putative chromosome locations of these Lr genes using SSR markers that provided coverage of the genome. MBSA predicted that the Lr genes were located on chromosomes 5B and 5D. A doubled haploid population was generated from the cross of JBT05-714 (HY644*3/KU3198), a line carrying one of the Lr genes from KU3198, to Thatcher. This population segregated for a single Lr gene conferring resistance to Pt race MBDS, which was mapped to the terminal region of the short arm of chromosome 5B with SSR markers and given the temporary designation LrK1. One F3 family derived from the HY644/KU3198 F2 population that segregated only for the second Lr gene from KU3198 was identified. This family was treated as an F2-equivalent population and used for mapping the Lr gene, which was located to the terminal region of chromosome 5DS. As no other Lr gene has been mapped to 5DS, this gene is novel and has been designated as Lr70."

"30233617","abstracttext","Heat stress during the seedling stage of early-planted winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most abiotic stresses of the crop restricting forage and grain production in the Southern Plains of the United States. To map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and identify single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers associated with seedling heat tolerance, a genome-wide association mapping study (GWAS) was conducted using 200 diverse representative lines of the hard red winter wheat association mapping panel, which was established by the Triticeae Coordinated Agricultural Project (TCAP) and genotyped with the wheat iSelect 90K SNP array. The plants were initially planted under optimal temperature conditions in two growth chambers. At the three-leaf stage, one chamber was set to 40/35°C day/night as heat stress treatment, while the other chamber was kept at optimal temperature (25/20°C day/night) as control for 14 days. Data were collected on leaf chlorophyll content, shoot length, number of leaves per seedling, and seedling recovery after removal of heat stress treatment. Phenotypic variability for seedling heat tolerance among wheat lines was observed in this study. Using the mixed linear model (MLM), we detected multiple significant QTLs for seedling heat tolerance on different chromosomes. Some of the QTLs were detected on chromosomes that were previously reported to harbor QTLs for heat tolerance during the flowering stage of wheat. These results suggest that some heat tolerance QTLs are effective from the seedling to reproductive stages in wheat. However, new QTLs that have never been reported at the reproductive stage were found responding to seedling heat stress in the present study. Candidate gene analysis revealed high sequence similarities of some significant loci with candidate genes involved in plant stress responses including heat, drought, and salt stress. This study provides valuable information about the genetic basis of seedling heat tolerance in wheat. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first GWAS to map QTLs associated with seedling heat tolerance targeting early planting of dual-purpose winter wheat. The SNP markers identified in this study will be used for marker-assisted selection (MAS) of seedling heat tolerance during dual-purpose wheat breeding."

Structural characterization of puroindolines from Triticum monococum was initiated by amplifying and subsequently cloning the corresponding pin gene into an expression vector, known as pET-32a(+). The protein contains five tryptophanin domains and ten cysteine residues. The pinB gene was fused with the 109aa Trx.Tag thioredoxin for a high-level expression. The cloning sites used for producing fusion proteins also contained cleavable His.Tag and S.tag sequences for detection and purification. After transformation of competent Origami cells, fusion protein expression was detected by growing a transformant in LB medium in the presence of 0.1 mM IPTG at room temperature for 6 hrs on a shaker. Both soluble and insoluble fusion proteins were extracted from Origami cells after sonication. Ni-NTA column (Qiagen) was used to extract and purify these fractions. Following an overnight digestion of the recombinant protein with enterokinase at room temperature, the corresponding fractions were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gel, electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane and cross-reacted with the anti-friabilin monoclonal antibody. We found that the recombinant PINB protein had a molecular weight of 16 kDa whereas TrxB was 21 kDa. Fusion protein ran at 34 kDa. PINB protein from wheat was shown to be immunologically related to a homologue, tryptophanin, in oat seed. Further study is currently underway to characterize these proteins structurally using NMR."

"26211966","abstracttext","The wheat recombinant chromosome inbred line LDN(Dic-3A)10, obtained through introgression of a Triticum dicoccoides disomic chromosome 3A fragment into Triticum turgidum spp. durum var. Langdon, is resistant to fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium graminearum. To identify genes involved in FHB resistance, we used a cDNA-AFLP approach to compare gene expression between LDN(Dic-3A)10 and the susceptible parental line LDN at different time points post-inoculation. In total, 85 out of the ∼ 500 transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) were found to be differentially expressed: 36 and 19% were upregulated in LDN(Dic-3A)10 and LDN, respectively, whereas 45% were induced in both genotypes. Several of the cloned TDFs showed similarity to proteins involved in specific recognition of plant pathogens or associated with early responses to infection. Some TDFs specific to the inoculation response did not show similarity to characterized proteins. The availability of T. aestivum genome sequences allowed the in silico mapping of 28 TDFs and the acquirement of the corresponding gene sequences and, in some cases, their regulatory regions. Analysis of promoter regions revealed the potential existence of shared transcription regulation mechanisms. For instance, three TDF-associated genes contained binding sites for WRKY transcription factors, which have been implicated in the regulation of genes associated with pathogen defense, and three for abscisic acid-responsive element (ABRE). Collectively, our results revealed specific pathogen recognition in the interactions of LDN and LDN(Dic-3A)10 with F. graminearum. Such recognition leads to changes in the expression of several transcripts, attributable to the presence of the wheat QTL Qfhs.ndsu-3AS."

"30788378","abstracttext","Ethylene response factor proteins are important for regulating gene expression under different stresses. Different isoforms for ERF have previously isolated from bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and related genera and called from TaERF1 to TaERF5 . We isolated, cloned and molecular characterized a novel one based on TdERF1 , an isoform in durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum L.) and called TaERF6 . Its cDNA was synthesized, sequenced and compared with genomic sequence to figure out intron and exon regions and determine coding sequence region. The length of TdERF1 gene was 1939 bp and cDNA was 1065 bp including two exons, the first one 259 bp and the second one 806 bp separated by a 874 bp intron with a 111 bp 5'-UTR (untranslated region) and 401 bp 3'-UTR. TaERF6 encodes a 353 amino acids protein with nearly 99% identity to TdERF1. Hydrophobic cluster analysis revealed an N-terminal hydrophobic domain contains a highly conserved motif with the consensus sequence of M [C/L/Y] [G/R] [G/R/P] [A/G/V/L/R] [I/L/R/S/P/Q] [L/I/R/H] and hydrophobic clusters in AP2/ERF domain of which tends to form -sheet. Three monopartite nuclear localization signals also identified in TaERF6 that play important role in getting back into the nucleus. The results showed several putative phosphorylation sites in TaERF6 that a motif from residues 246 to 266, the CMVII-4 motif, was predicted to phosphorylate by different kinase proteins and play important roles in TaERF6 function. Phylogenetic analysis showed 7 clusters (I to VII) and 10 subclusters according to their relatedness in Poaceae family."

"10852485","abstracttext","The amplified restriction fragment length polymorphism (AFLP)-based mRNA fingerprinting (AMF) method makes it possible systematically and conveniently to identify differentially expressed cDNAs with high reproducibility. We have applied the AMF method to the cloning of the Q gene of common wheat, which is located on the long arm of chromosome 5A and pleiotropically controls the spike morphology and the threshing character of seeds. Using the AMF method, we compared the fingerprints of mRNA samples extracted from the young spikes of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS) carrying the Q gene to those of a chromosome deletion line of CS, namely, q5, which lacks 15% of 5AL including the Q gene. Approximately 12,200 fragments were produced after PCR with 256 primer combinations. Of these, 92 fragments were differentially expressed between CS and q5. Northern and Southern analyses showed that 16 fragments gave specific or relatively stronger transcript signals in CS, and these clones were present in single copy or in low copy numbers in the wheat genome. Four clones were genetically mapped to the region deleted in q5. Subsequently, one clone, pTaQ22, was mapped at the same locus as the Q gene, indicating that pTaQ22 corresponds to the Q gene or is tightly linked to it. DNA sequence data showed that pTaQ22 had no homology to any known genes, thus suggesting a novel function for this gene in flower morphogenesis. This AMF method might provide a straightforward method for isolating genes in the hexaploid background of common wheat."

"11681613","abstracttext","The long arm of chromosome 4D in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been shown in previous studies to harbor genes of agronomic importance. A major dominant gene conferring Aluminum (Al) tolerance (Alt2 in 'Chinese Spring' and AltBH in 'BH 1146'), and the Knal locus controlling the K+/Na+ discrimination in saline environments have been mapped to this chromosome arm. However, accurate information on the genetic and physical location of markers related to any of these genes is not available and would be useful for map-based cloning and marker-assisted plant breeding. In the present study, using a population of 91 recombinant inbred lines segregating for Al tolerance, we provide a more extensive genetic linkage map of the chromosome arm 4DL based on RFLP, SSR, and AFLP markers, delimiting the AltBH gene to a 5.9-cM interval between markers Xgdm125 and Xpsr914. In addition, utilizing a set of wheat deletion lines for chromosome arm 4DL, the AltBH gene was physically mapped to the distal region of the chromosome, between deletion breakpoints 0.70 and 0.86, where the kilobase/centimorgan ratio is assumed to be low, making the map-based cloning of the gene a more realistic goal. The polymorphism rates in chromosome arm 4DL for the different types of markers used were extremely low, as confirmed by the physical mapping of AFLPs. Finally, analysis of 1 Mb of contiguous sequence of Arabidopsis chromosome 5 flanking the gene homologous to the BCD1230 clone (a cosegregating marker in our population coding for a ribulose-5-phosphate-3-epimerase gene), revealed a previously identified region of stress-related and disease-resistance genes. This could explain the collinearity observed in comparative mapping studies among different species and the low level of polymorphism detected in the chromosome arm 4DL in hexaploid wheat."
"15247374","articletitle","Evolution and function of the sucrose-phosphate synthase gene families in wheat and other grasses."
"15247374","abstracttext","Suc-phosphate synthase (SPS) is a key regulatory enzyme in the pathway of Suc biosynthesis and has been linked to quantitative trait loci controlling plant growth and yield. In dicotyledonous plants there are three SPS gene families: A, B, and C. Here we report the finding of five families of SPS genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and other monocotyledonous plants from the family Poaceae (grasses). Three of these form separate subfamilies within the previously described A, B, and C gene families, but the other two form a novel and distinctive D family, which on present evidence is only found in the Poaceae. The D-type SPS proteins lack the phosphorylation sites associated with 14-3-3 protein binding and osmotic stress activation, and the linker region between the N-terminal catalytic glucosyltransferase domain and the C-terminal Suc-phosphatase-like domain is 80 to 90 amino acid residues shorter than in the A, B, or C types. The D family appears to have arisen after the divergence of mono- and dicotyledonous plants, with a later duplication event resulting in the two D-type subfamilies. Each of the SPS gene families in wheat showed different, but overlapping, spatial and temporal expression patterns, and in most organs at least two different SPS genes are expressed. Analysis of expressed sequence tags indicated similar expression patterns to wheat for each SPS gene family in barley (Hordeum vulgare) but not in more distantly related grasses. We identified an expressed sequence tag from rice (Oryza sativa) that appears to be derived from an endogenous antisense SPS gene, and this might account for the apparently low level of expression of the related OsSPS11 sense gene, adding to the already extensive list of mechanisms for regulating the activity of SPS in plants."

"29843596","abstracttext_background","Understanding the genetic basis of frost tolerance (FT) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is essential for preventing yield losses caused by frost due to cellular damage, dehydration and reduced metabolism. FT is a complex trait regulated by a number of genes and several gene families. Availability of the wheat genomic sequence opens new opportunities for exploring candidate genes diversity for FT. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to identity SNPs and insertion-deletion (indels) in genes known to be involved in frost tolerance and to perform association genetics analysis of respective SNPs and indels on FT."
"29843596","abstracttext_results","Here we report on the sequence analysis of 19 candidate genes for FT in wheat assembled using the Chinese Spring IWGSC RefSeq v1.0. Out of these, the tandem duplicated C-repeat binding factors (CBF), i.e. CBF-A3, CBF-A5, CBF-A10, CBF-A13, CBF-A14, CBF-A15, CBF-A18, the vernalisation response gene VRN-A1, VRN-B3, the photoperiod response genes PPD-B1 and PPD-D1 revealed association to FT in 235 wheat cultivars. Within six genes (CBF-A3, CBF-A15, VRN-A1, VRN-B3, PPD-B1 and PPD-D1) amino acid (AA) substitutions in important protein domains were identified. The amino acid substitution effect in VRN-A1 on FT was confirmed and new AA substitutions in CBF-A3, CBF-A15, VRN-B3, PPD-B1 and PPD-D1 located at highly conserved sites were detected. Since these results rely on phenotypic data obtained at five locations in 2 years, detection of significant associations of FT to AA changes in CBF-A3, CBF-A15, VRN-A1, VRN-B3, PPD-B1 and PPD-D1 may be exploited in marker assisted breeding for frost tolerance in winter wheat."

"24129675","abstracttext","A study on mode of inheritance and mapping of fertility restorer (Rf) gene(s) using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers was conducted in a cross of male sterile line 2041A having Triticum timopheevi cytoplasm and a restorer line PWR4099 of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The F1 hybrid was completely fertile indicating that fertility restoration is a dominant trait. Based on the pollen fertility and seed set of bagged spikes in F2 generation, the individual plants were classified into fertile and sterile groups. Out of 120 F2 plants, 97 were fertile and 23 sterile (based on pollen fertility) while 98 plants set ≥ 5 seeds/spike and 22 produced ≤ 4 or no seed. The observed frequency fits well into Mendelian ratio of 3 fertile: 1 sterile with χ(2) value of 2.84 for pollen fertility and 2.17 for seed setting indicating that the fertility restoration is governed by a single dominant gene in PWR4099. The three linked SSR markers, Xwmc503, Xgwm296 and Xwmc112 located on the chromosome 2DS were placed at a distance of 3.3, 5.8 and 6.7 cM, respectively, from the Rf gene. Since, no known Rf gene is located on the chromosome arm 2DS, the Rf gene in PWR4099 is a new gene and proposed as Rf8. The closest SSR marker, Xwmc503, linked to the Rf8 was validated in a set of Rf, maintainer and cytoplasmic male sterile lines. The closely linked SSR marker Xwmc503 may be used in marker-assisted backcross breeding facilitating the transfer of fertility restoration gene Rf8 into elite backgrounds with ease."

"8399111","abstracttext","Incorporation of N-acetylglucosamine-specific agglutinins from wheat germ (Triticum aestivum; WGA), thorn apple (Datura stramonium) or nettle (Urtica dioica) rhizomes in the diet at the level of 7 g/kg reduced the apparent digestibility and utilization of dietary proteins and the growth of rats, with WGA being the most damaging. As a result of their binding and endocytosis by the epithelial cells of the small intestine, all three lectins were growth factors for the gut and interfered with its metabolism and function to varying degrees. WGA was particularly effective; it induced extensive polyamine-dependent hyperplastic and hypertrophic growth of the small bowel by increasing its content of proteins, RNA and DNA. Furthermore, an appreciable portion of the endocytosed WGA was transported across the gut wall into the systemic circulation, where it was deposited in the walls of the blood and lymphatic vessels. WGA also induced the hypertrophic growth of the pancreas and caused thymus atrophy. Although the transfer of the gene of WGA into crop plants has been advocated to increase their insect resistance, as the presence of this lectin in the diet may harm higher animals at the concentrations required to be effective against most pests, its use in plants as natural insecticide is not without health risks for man."

"11244110","abstracttext","Although the Mutator (Mu) system is well characterized in maize (Zea mays), very little is known about this highly mutagenic system of transposons in other grasses. Mutator is regulated by the MuDR class of elements, which encodes two genes, one of which, mudrA, has similarity to a number of bacterial transposases. Experiments in our laboratory, as well as database searches, demonstrate that mudrA sequences are ubiquitous and diverse in the grasses. In several species it is clear that multiple paralogous elements can be present in a single genome. In some species such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and rice (Oryza sativa), mudrA-similar sequences are represented in cDNA databases, suggesting the presence of active Mu transposon systems in these species. Further, in rice and in sorghum, mudrA-like genes are flanked by long terminal inverted repeats, as well as the short host sequence direct repeats diagnostic of insertion. Thus, there is ample evidence that systems related to Mu in maize are at least potentially active in a wide variety of grasses. However, the mudrB gene, though important for Mu activity in maize, is not necessarily a component of Mu elements in other grasses."

We report the cloning of a full-length cDNA encoding NMT from Triticum aestivum (TaNMT). The cDNA included a predicted open reading frame of 1317 nucleotides, which encoded a predicted protein of 438 amino acids containing all of the residues that are important for NMT activity. The TaNMT amino acid and nucleotide sequences were compared with NMTs from 14 other species encompassing a wide array of taxonomic groups. Among the experimentally validated NMTs, TaNMT was most similar to that of Arabidopsis thaliana. Southern blot analysis of wheat genomic DNA showed that TaNMT is encoded by a single copy gene, with one copy per haploid genome. We expressed TaNMT in Escherichia coli cells and determined that the recombinant protein possessed NMT activity, catalyzing the N-myristoylation of peptides from known or putatively myristoylated proteins from plants and animals without a strong preference for the plant peptides. TaNMT is the second experimentally validated plant NMT sequence and the first from a monocotyledonous species."

"12502249","abstracttext","Wild oat (Avena fatua L.) populations resistant to herbicides that inhibit acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase; EC 6.4.1.2) represent an increasingly important weed control problem. The objective of this study was to determine the ACCase mutation responsible for herbicide resistance in a well-studied wild oat biotype (UMI). A 2039-bp region encompassing the carboxybiotin and acetyl-CoA binding domains of multifunctional plastidic ACCase was analyzed. DNA sequences representing three plastidic ACCase gene loci were isolated from both the resistant UMI and a herbicide-susceptible biotype, consistent with the hexaploid nature of wild oat. Only one nonsynonymous point mutation was found among the resistant wild oat sequences, inferring an isoleucine to leucine substitution. The position of this substitution corresponds to residue 1769 of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plastidic ACCase (GenBank accession No. AF029895). Analysis of an F2 population derived from a cross between a herbicide-resistant and a susceptible biotype confirmed co-segregation of herbicide resistance with the mutated ACCase. We conclude that the isoleucine to leucine mutation is responsible for herbicide resistance in UMI wild oat based on a comparison of the substitution site across species and ACCase types. While isoleucine is conserved among plastidic ACCases of herbicide-susceptible grasses, leucine is found in plastidic and cytosolic forms of multifunctional herbicide-resistant ACCase."

"12223716","abstracttext","The importance of the two chiral centers at C-3 and C-7 in the molecular structure of jasmonic acid in plant responses was investigated. We separated methyl jasmonate (MeJA) into (3R)- and (3S)-isomers with a fixed stereochemistry at C-3, but epimerization at C-7 is possible. The four isomers of the nonepimerizable analog 7-methyl MeJA were synthesized. These six esters and their corresponding acids were tested in three bioassays: (a) senescence in sunflower (Helianthus annuus) cotyledons; (b) proteinase inhibitor II gene expression in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) with [beta]-glucuronidase as a biochemical reporter; and (c) seed germination in Brassica napus and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The esters and acids had similar activities in the three assays, with the ester being more effective than its acid. The (3R)-stereochemistry was critical for jasmonate activity. Although activity was reduced after substituting the C-7 proton with a methyl group, the analogs with (3R,7R)- or (3R,7S)-stereochemistry were active in some of the assays. Although the four isomers of 7-methyl MeJA were inactive or only weakly active in the senescence assay, they could overcome the senescence-promoting effect of (3R)-MeJA. The strongest antagonistic effect was observed with the (3R,7S)-isomer."

All three tests produced trees with identical topologies and confirmed the presence of three clades within S. graminum. Clones showed no relationship between biotype and mtDNA haplotype. At least one biotype was found in all three clades, suggesting exchange among clades of genetic material conditioning for crop virulence, or the sharing of a common ancestor. However, there was a relationship between host and haplotype. Clade 1 was the most homogeneous and contained 12 of 16 clones collected from cultivated hosts and five of the six collected from johnsongrass, Sorghum halepense, a congener of cultivated sorghum, S. bicolor. Four of the six clones collected from Agropyron spp. were found in clade 2. Clade 3 contained two clones from wheat, Triticum aestivum, and four from non-cultivated hosts other than Agropyron spp. A partitioning of populations by mtDNA haplotype and host suggests the occurrence of host adapted races in Schizaphis graminum."

"12586900","abstracttext","Expression of cytosolic and plastid acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) gene families at the mRNA level was analyzed in developing wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants. The major plastid ACCase mRNA level is high in the middle part of the plant and low in roots and leaf blades. An alternative plastid ACCase transcript initiated at a different promoter and using an alternative 5' splice site for the first intron accumulates to its highest level in roots. Cytosolic ACCase mRNA also consists of two species, one of which is present at approximately a constant level, whereas the other accumulates to a high level in the lower sheath section. It is likely that different promoters are also responsible for the two forms of cytosolic ACCase mRNA. The abundances of cytosolic and plastid ACCase mRNAs in the sheath section of the plant are similar. ACCase protein level is significantly lower in the leaf blades, in parallel with changes in the total ACCase mRNA level. Homoeologous ACCase genes show the same expression patterns and similar mRNA levels, suggesting that none of the genes was silenced or acquired new tissue specificity after polyploidization."

"14745556","abstracttext","In wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), embryogenic callus formation comprises suppression of precocious germination by the zygotic embryo and the initiation of dedifferentiated cellular proliferation within it. Embryogenic calli are induced by treating immature embryos with 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D). Upon withdrawal from 2,4-D, somatic embryos develop from the periphery of the callus. Prior to visible callus formation, there is a striking induction of ""germin-like"" oxalate oxidase (""gl-OXO"": EC 1.2.3.4) gene expression. Accumulation of gl-OXO mRNA is rapidly stimulated upon auxin treatment, with a consequent development of apoplastic enzyme activity producing H(2)O(2) within the cell wall. Within the dedifferentiated calli, gl-OXO enzyme activity becomes widespread over the surface of embryogenic calli. Differentiation of somatic embryos is initiated in regions of densely cytoplasmic, meristematic cells that are marked by highly localised expression of gl-OXO activity within these embryogenic cell masses. We suggest that this localised generation of H(2)O(2) by gl-OXO promotes peroxidative cross-linking of cell wall components, thereby preventing cellular expansion and maintaining these cell masses in an embryogenically competent condition."

In this paper, chromosome 1 linkage maps of Triticum aestivum, T. tauschii, and T. monococcum are compared with existing barley and rye maps to develop a consensus map for Triticeae species and thus facilitate the mapping of agronomic genes in this tribe. The consensus map that was developed consists of 14 agronomically important genes, 17 DNA markers that were derived from known-function clones, and 76 DNA markers derived from anonymous clones. There are 12 inconsistencies in the order of markers among seven wheat, four barley, and two rye maps. A comparison of the Triticeae group 1 chromosome consensus map with linkage maps of homoeologous chromosomes in rice indicates that the linkage maps for the long arm and the proximal portion of the short arm of group 1 chromosomes are conserved among these species. Similarly, gene order is conserved between Triticeae chromosome 1 and its homoeologous chromosome in oat. The location of the centromere in rice and oat chromosomes is estimated from its position in homoeologous group 1 chromosomes of Triticeae."

"15120117","abstracttext","We have isolated and characterized a new photosynthetic tissue-specific gene NTZIP (Nicotiana tabacum leucine zipper) from tobacco (N. tabacum). Its deduced amino acid sequence has two highly conserved regions, leucine zipper and [EX(n)DEXRH](2) motifs, which are related to the gene's biochemical functions. NTZIP was expressed in leaves and stems, but was not detected in roots or flowers, suggesting that its physiological functions might be associated with photosynthesis. Northern blot analysis showed that NTZIP mRNA accumulation was induced by light signals, increased greatly under low temperatures and was repressed by strong light illumination. Furthermore, a number of homologs of NTZIP were isolated from cucumber (Cucumis sativus), rape (Brassica napus), clover (Trifolium repens), willow (Salix babylonica), rosebush (Rusa dovurica), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and spinach (Spinacia oleracea), proving the ubiquitous existence of the NTZIP-like genes in higher plants. Transgenic tobaccos constitutively expressing antisense RNA to NTZIP displayed chlorosis and a lack of ability to turn green even under normal growth conditions. The chlorophyll deficiency was further confirmed by chlorophyll content determination and gas exchange analysis. Based on these observations, we propose that NTZIP may be involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis, and might define a novel family of evolutionarily conserved proteins with its homologs in other plant species."

"16361516","abstracttext","Ran is an evolutionarily conserved eukaryotic GTPase. We previously identified a cDNA of TaRAN1, a novel Ran GTPase homologous gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and demonstrated that TaRAN1 is associated with regulation of genome integrity and cell division in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) systems. However, much less is known about the function of RAN in plant development. To analyze the possible biological roles of Ran GTPase, we overexpressed TaRAN1 in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). TaRAN1 overexpression increased the proportion of cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle, which resulted in an elevated mitotic index and prolonged life cycle. Furthermore, it led to increased primordial tissue, reduced number of lateral roots, and stimulated hypersensitivity to exogenous auxin. The results suggest that Ran protein was involved in the regulation of mitotic progress, either in the shoot apical meristem or the root meristem zone in plants, where auxin signaling is involved. This article determines the function of RAN in plant development mediated by the cell cycle and its novel role in meristem initiation mediated by auxin signaling."

"16777426","abstracttext","Callose ((1,3)-beta-glucan) is important during basic developmental processes of plants, but only little is known about the regulation of callose biosynthesis on molecular level. Growing evidence indicates that glucan synthase-like (GSL) genes in higher plants are involved in callose synthesis. We analyzed the expression of eight GSL genes (TaGSL) as well as callose synthase activity and total callose content in the stem, leaf blade and spike of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Organ-specific expression of six TaGSL genes and strong differences in expression levels were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Differences were also determined in callose synthase (EC 2.4.1.34) activity and total amount of callose in the examined organs. Aniline blue staining in tissue sections localized callose depositions. These results allow a comprehensive reflection of callose regulation, considering gene expression, enzyme activity and enzyme product quantification as well as localization. Our data suggests that callose synthesis is highly regulated by a combination of GSL genes, which are involved either in general or in organ-specific developmental processes."

"16653133","abstracttext","Lophopyrum elongatum is a highly salt-tolerant relative of wheat. A previous study showed that the abundance of a number of mRNA species is enhanced or reduced in the roots of the L. elongatum x Triticum aestivum amphiploid by salt stress. Eleven genes with enhanced expression in the roots of salt-stressed L. elongatum plants have been cloned as cDNAs. The clones were used as probes to characterize temporal expression of these genes in roots after initiation of salt (250 mm NaCl) stress. All 11 genes are induced within 2 h after exposure to 250 mm NaCl and reached peak expression after 6 h. The decline of gene expression distinguished two groups, one in which mRNA concentrations returned to basal levels by 24 h and the other in which this occurred between 3 and 7 d. One of the 11 clones was found to be homologous to a multigene family of abscisic acid-induced genes, rab and dhn, identified in other species. We suggest that the coordinate expression of this large number of genes reflects the existence of a highly specific early response to salt stress. We refer to this response as the ""early salt stress response."""
"16941905","articletitle","Nonhost resistance of barley is successfully manifested against Magnaporthe grisea and a closely related Pennisetum-infecting lineage but is overcome by Magnaporthe oryzae."
"16941905","abstracttext","Magnaporthe oryzae is a major pathogen of rice (Oryza sativa L.) but is also able to infect other grasses, including barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Here, we report a study using Magnaporthe isolates collected from other host plant species to evaluate their capacity to infect barley. A nonhost type of resistance was detected in barley against isolates derived from genera Pennisetum (fontaingrass) or Digitaria (crabgrass), but no resistance occurred in response to isolates from rice, genus Eleusine (goosegrass), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), or maize (Zea mays L.), respectively. Restriction of pathogen growth in the nonhost interaction was investigated microscopically and compared with compatible interactions. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify fungal biomass in both types of interaction. The phylogenetic relationship among the Magnaporthe isolates used in this study was investigated by inferring gene trees for fragments of three genes, actin, calmodulin, and beta-tubulin. Based on phylogenetic analysis, we could distinguish different species that were strictly correlated with the ability of the isolates to infect barley. We demonstrated that investigating specific host interaction phenotypes for a range of pathogen isolates can accurately highlight genetic diversity within a pathogen population."
"16935986","articletitle","Discovery of cyclotide-like protein sequences in graminaceous crop plants: ancestral precursors of circular proteins?"
"16935986","abstracttext","Cyclotides are peptides from plants of the Rubiaceae and Violaceae families that have the unusual characteristic of a macrocylic backbone. They are further characterized by their incorporation of a cystine knot in which two disulfides, along with the intervening backbone residues, form a ring through which a third disulfide is threaded. The cyclotides have been found in every Violaceae species screened to date but are apparently present in only a few Rubiaceae species. The selective distribution reported so far raises questions about the evolution of the cyclotides within the plant kingdom. In this study, we use a combined bioinformatics and expression analysis approach to elucidate the evolution and distribution of the cyclotides in the plant kingdom and report the discovery of related sequences widespread in the Poaceae family, including crop plants such as rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), which carry considerable economic and social importance. The presence of cyclotide-like sequences within these plants suggests that the cyclotides may be derived from an ancestral gene of great antiquity. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to show that two of the discovered cyclotide-like genes from rice and barley (Hordeum vulgare) have tissue-specific expression patterns."

"17416730","abstracttext","Gibberellic acid (GA) promotes seed germination, elongation growth, and flowering time in plants. GA responses are repressed by DELLA proteins, which contain an N-terminal DELLA domain essential for GA-dependent proteasomal degradation of DELLA repressors. Mutations of or within the DELLA domain of DELLA repressors have been described for species including Arabidopsis thaliana, wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), and barley (Hordeum vulgare), and we show that these mutations confer GA insensitivity when introduced into the Arabidopsis GA INSENSITIVE (GAI) DELLA repressor. We also demonstrate that Arabidopsis mutants lacking the three GA INSENSITIVE DWARF1 (GID1) GA receptor genes are GA insensitive with respect to GA-promoted growth responses, GA-promoted DELLA repressor degradation, and GA-regulated gene expression. Our genetic interaction studies indicate that GAI and its close homolog REPRESSOR OF ga1-3 are the major growth repressors in a GA receptor mutant background. We further demonstrate that the GA insensitivity of the GAI DELLA domain mutants is explained in all cases by the inability of the mutant proteins to interact with the GID1A GA receptor. Since we found that the GAI DELLA domain alone can mediate GA-dependent GID1A interactions, we propose that the DELLA domain functions as a receiver domain for activated GA receptors."

"17884694","abstracttext","Analysis of the gene expression differentiation in leaves of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Baofeng 7228, under salt stress, was carried out by Differential-Display Reverse Transcription-polymerase Chain Reaction (DDRT-PCR.) Twenty-seven differential cDNA fragments were obtained. The expression of the SR07 fragment was induced noticeably by salt treatment, and the nucleotide sequence homology of 87% between the SR07 fragment and PIPs (water channel proteins) was observed. Further research showed that a 561 bp open read frame was present in the SR07 fragment. Plant expression vector of pCAMBIA-SR07 was constructed and three transformants of tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum) mediated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens plasmid were obtained. Resistance to salt, PEG, and mannitol stresses of the three transformants were examined. No significant difference (P > 0.05) was observed between the control and the transformants in resistance to salt stress, but there was significant difference (P < 0.05) between the control and the transformants in resistance to PEG and mannitol stresses. Therefore, the expression of the SR07 fragment may play an important role in the water regulation of the plant."

"18499076","abstracttext","Multiform single chain variable fragments (scFvs) including different length linker scFvs and bispecific scFv were constructed. The linker lengths of 0, 3, 5, 8, 12, and 15 amino acids between V(H) and V(L) of antideoxynivalenol (anti-DON) scFv were used to analyze the affinities of scFvs. The affinity constants of these scFvs increased when the linker was lower than 12 amino acids. The affinity constant would not change when the linker was longer than 12 amino acids. Fusion gene of anti-DON scFv and antizearalenone (anti-ZEN) scFv was also constructed through connection by a short peptide linker DNA to express a bispecific scFv. The affinity constants assay showed that the two scFvs of fusion bispecific scFv remained their own affinity compared to their parental scFvs. Competitive direct enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect DON and ZEN in contaminated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) samples, and the results indicated that this bispecific scFv was applicable in DON and ZEN detection. This work confirmed that bispecific scFv could be successfully obtained, and might also have an application in diagnosing fungal infection, and breeding transgenic plants."
"20038518","articletitle","Under what circumstances can process-based simulation models link genotype to phenotype for complex traits? Case-study of fruit and grain quality traits."
"20038518","abstracttext","Detailed information has arisen from research at gene and cell levels, but it is still incomplete in the context of a quantitative understanding of whole plant physiology. Because of their integrative nature, process-based simulation models can help to bridge the gap between genotype and phenotype and assist in deconvoluting genotype-by-environment (GxE) interactions for complex traits. Indeed, GxE interactions are emergent properties of simulation models, i.e. unexpected properties generated by complex interconnections between subsystem components and biological processes. They co-occur in the system with synergistic or antagonistic effects. In this work, different kinds of GxE interactions are illustrated. Approaches to link model parameters to genes or quantitative trait loci (QTL) are briefly reviewed. Then the analysis of GxE interactions through simulation models is illustrated with an integrated model simulation of peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) fruit mass and sweetness, and with a model of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grain yield and protein concentration. This paper suggests that the management of complex traits such as fruit and grain quality may become possible, thanks to the increasing knowledge concerning the genetic and environmental regulation of organ size and composition and to the development of models simulating the complex aspects of metabolism and biophysical behaviours at the plant and organ levels."

"19958808","abstracttext","Jasmonates are known to induce the transcriptional activation of plant defense genes, which leads to the production of jasmonate-regulated proteins (JRP). We previously cloned and characterized a novel jacalin-like lectin gene (Ta-JA1) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which codes a modular JRP with disease response and jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domains and is present only in the Gramineae family. The function of this protein is still unclear. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that Ta-JA1 and related proteins from cereals grouped together, which diverged from JRL with an additional N-terminal disease response domain. The recombinant Ta-JA1 proteins agglutinated rabbit erythrocytes, and this hemagglutination activity was preferentially inhibited by mannose. The Ta-JA1 protein was able to inhibit E. coli cell growth. Overexpression of Ta-JA1 in transgenic tobacco plants increased their resistance to infection by tobacco bacterial, fungal and viral pathogens. Our results suggest that Ta-JA1 belongs to a mannose-specific lectin, which may confer a basal but broad-spectrum resistance to plant pathogens. Ta-JA1 and its homologues in maize, rice, sorghum and creeping bentgrass may represent a new type of monocot lectin with a modular structure and diversity of physiological functions in biotic and abiotic stress responses."

"19810358","abstracttext","Certain plant species promote biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), but few studies have examined the microbial populations that are associated with the rhizoplane of these plants. In this study, the bacterial composition of the rhizoplane were characterized for four plant species during in soils with different histories of exposure to PAH and in the presence or absence of a pyrene spike at 100 mg kg(-1) pyrene. Three of the plant species including Andropogon gerrardii, Panicum coloratum and Melilotus officinalis were known to stimulate PAH degradation. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was used as a reference species. Results showed that after 90 days, approximately 45% of the pyrene spike disappeared from soil without plants. In contrast, cultivation of plants resulted in 95% disappearance of pyrene. There were no significant differences in the extent of pyrene disappearance for different plants. In all cases, 16S rRNA gene profiles of the rhizoplane were less complex in the pyrene-spiked soils, suggesting that richness and evenness of the predominant bacteria were reduced. Our results show that pyrene contamination results in significant shifts in the composition of rhizosphere bacterial communities that are still further influenced by the plant species and prior exposure history to PAH contamination."

"23346224","abstracttext","Since the domestication of crop species, humans have derived specific varieties for particular uses and shaped the genetic diversity of these varieties. Here, using an interdisciplinary approach combining ethnobotany and population genetics, we document the within-variety genetic structure of a population-variety of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in relation to farmers' practices to decipher their contribution to crop species evolution. Using 19 microsatellites markers, we conducted two complementary graph theory-based methods to analyze population structure and gene flow among 19 sub-populations of a single population-variety [Rouge de Bordeaux (RDB)]. The ethnobotany approach allowed us to determine the RDB history including diffusion and reproduction events. We found that the complex genetic structure among the RDB sub-populations is highly consistent with the structure of the seed diffusion and reproduction network drawn based on the ethnobotanical study. This structure highlighted the key role of the farmer-led seed diffusion through founder effects, selection and genetic drift because of human practices. An important result is that the genetic diversity conserved on farm is complementary to that found in the genebank indicating that both systems are required for a more efficient crop diversity conservation."

"22107346","abstracttext","Acidovorax radicis N35, isolated from surface-sterilized wheat roots (Triticum aestivum), showed irreversible phenotypic variation in nutrient broth, resulting in a differing colony morphology. In addition to the wild-type form (rough colony type), a phenotypic variant form (smooth colony type) appeared at a frequency of 3.2 × 10(-3) per cell per generation on NB agar plates. In contrast to the N35 wild type, the variant N35v showed almost no cell aggregation and had lost its flagella and swarming ability. After inoculation, only the wild-type N35 significantly promoted the growth of soil-grown barley plants. After co-inoculation of axenically grown barley seedlings with differentially fluorescently labeled N35 and N35v cells, decreased competitive endophytic root colonization in the phenotypic variant N35v was observed using confocal laser scanning microscopy. In addition, 454 pyrosequencing of both phenotypes revealed almost identical genomic sequences. The only stable difference noted in the sequence of the phenotype variant N35v was a 16-nucleotide deletion identified in a gene encoding the mismatch repair protein MutL. The deletion resulted in a frameshift that revealed a new stop codon resulting in a truncated MutL protein missing a functional MutL C-terminal domain. The mutation was consistent in all investigated phenotype variant cultures and might be responsible for the observed phenotypic variation in A. radicis N35."

"22350156","abstracttext","Salt and drought stresses often adversely affect plant growth and productivity, MYB transcription factors have been shown to participate in the response to these stresses. Here we identified a new R2R3-type MYB transcription factor gene TaMYB33 from wheat (Triticum aestivum). TaMYB33 was induced by NaCl, PEG and ABA treatments, and its promoter sequence contains putative ABRE, MYB and other abiotic stress related cis-elements. Ectopic over-expression of TaMYB33 in Arabidopsis thaliana remarkably enhanced its tolerance to drought and NaCl stresses, but not to LiCl and KCl treatments. The expressions of AtP5CS and AtZAT12 which mirror the activities of proline and ascorbate peroxidase synthesis respectively were induced in TaMYB33 over-expression lines, indicating TaMYB33 promotes the ability for osmotic pressure balance-reconstruction and reactive oxidative species (ROS) scavenging. The up-regulation of AtAAO3 along with down-regulation of AtABF3, AtABI1 in TaMYB33 over-expression lines indicated that ABA synthesis was elevated while its signaling was restricted. These results suggest that TaMYB33 enhances salt and drought tolerance partially through superior ability for osmotic balance reconstruction and ROS detoxification."

"23000066","abstracttext","A screen conducted on both a suppression subtractive hybridization and a full length cDNA library made from a salinity tolerant bread wheat cultivar SR3 (Triticum aestivum cv. SR3) resulted in the recognition of TaERF4, a gene including both an AP2/ERF domain and a nuclear localization signal. The 982 bp TaERF4 cDNA comprised a 582 bp open reading frame, encoding a 193 residue polypeptide of molecular weight 20 kDa and calculated pI 8.48. A TaERF4-GFP fusion protein localized preferentially to the nuclei of Arabidopsis thaliana protoplasts. TaERF4 is a member of the B-1 group within the ERF sub-family and was not transactivatable in yeast. The presence of an ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif at its C-terminus suggests that TaERF4 is probably a transcription repressor. TaERF4 was inducible by exposure to salinity and osmotic stresses, but not to exogenously supplied abscisic acid (ABA). The heterologous constitutive expression of TaERF4 in Arabidopsis enhanced the level of sensitivity to salinity stress, possibly via the repression of tonoplast Na(+)/H(+) antiporter activity. There was no phenotype associated with the transgene's presence when plants were subjected to either osmotic stress or ABA treatment. TaERF4 appears to be a transcription repressor acting within the ABA-independent response to salinity stress."

Seventy inter-simple sequence repeat EST and STS markers on 1BL were used to screen the two parents and resistant and susceptible bulks; those polymorphic were used to analyze the entire F(2) population. Three EST markers (BF474863, BE497107, and CD373538) were closely linked to LrZH84, with genetic distances of 0.7, 0.7, and 1.7 cM, respectively.

"23701123","abstracttext","Adaptation to temperate environments is common in the grass subfamily Pooideae, suggesting an ancestral origin of cold climate adaptation. Here, we investigated substitution rates of genes involved in low-temperature-induced (LTI) stress responses to test the hypothesis that adaptive molecular evolution of LTI pathway genes was important for Pooideae evolution. Substitution rates and signatures of positive selection were analyzed using 4330 gene trees including three warm climate-adapted species (maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and rice (Oryza sativa)) and five temperate Pooideae species (Brachypodium distachyon, wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), Lolium perenne and Festuca pratensis). Nonsynonymous substitution rate differences between Pooideae and warm habitat-adapted species were elevated in LTI trees compared with all trees. Furthermore, signatures of positive selection were significantly stronger in LTI trees after the rice and Pooideae split but before the Brachypodium divergence (P < 0.05). Genome-wide heterogeneity in substitution rates was also observed, reflecting divergent genome evolution processes within these grasses. Our results provide evidence for a link between adaptation to cold habitats and adaptive evolution of LTI stress responses in early Pooideae evolution and shed light on a poorly understood chapter in the evolutionary history of some of the world's most important temperate crops."

"23889215","abstracttext","Lactoferrin (LF) is a ubiquitous cationic iron-binding milk glycoprotein that contributes to nutrition and exerts a broad-spectrum primary defense against bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses in mammals. These qualities make lactoferrin protein and its antimicrobial motifs highly desirable candidates to be incorporated in plants to impart broad-based resistance against plant pathogens or to economically produce them in bulk quantities for pharmaceutical and nutritional purposes. This study introduced bovine LF (BLF) gene into tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum var. Xanthi), Arabidopsis ( A. thaliana ) and wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) via Agrobacterium -mediated plant transformation. Transgenic plants or detached leaves exhibited high levels of resistance against the damping-off causing fungal pathogen Rhizoctonia solani and the head blight causing fungal pathogen Fusarium graminearum . LF also imparted resistance to tomato plants against a bacterial pathogen, Ralstonia solanacearum . Similarly, other researchers demonstrated expression of LF and LF-mediated high-quality resistance to several other aggressive fungal and bacterial plant pathogens in transgenic plants and against viral pathogens by foliar applications of LF or its derivatives. Taken together, these studies demonstrated the effectiveness of LF for improving crop quality and its biopharming potentials for pharmaceautical and nutritional applications."
"24642944","articletitle","A role for barley CRYPTOCHROME1 in light regulation of grain dormancy and germination."
"24642944","abstracttext","It is well known that abscisic acid (ABA) plays a central role in the regulation of seed dormancy and that transcriptional regulation of genes encoding ABA biosynthetic and degradation enzymes is responsible for determining ABA content. However, little is known about the upstream signaling pathways impinging on transcription to ultimately regulate ABA content or how environmental signals (e.g., light and cold) might direct such expression in grains. Our previous studies indicated that light is a key environmental signal inhibiting germination in dormant grains of barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and Brachypodium distachyon and that this effect attenuates as after-ripening progresses further. We found that the blue component of the light spectrum inhibits completion of germination in barley by inducing the expression of the ABA biosynthetic gene 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase and dampening expression of ABA 8'-hydroxylase, thus increasing ABA content in the grain. We have now created barley transgenic lines downregulating the genes encoding the blue light receptors CRYTOCHROME (CRY1) and CRY2. Our results demonstrate that CRY1 is the key receptor perceiving and transducing the blue light signal in dormant grains."

"23918966","abstracttext","Rht-B1c, allelic to the DELLA protein-encoding gene Rht-B1a, is a natural mutation documented in common wheat (Triticum aestivum). It confers variation to a number of traits related to cell and plant morphology, seed dormancy, and photosynthesis. The present study was conducted to examine the sequence variations of Rht-B1c and their functional impacts. The results showed that Rht-B1c was partially dominant or co-dominant for plant height, and exhibited an increased dwarfing effect. At the sequence level, Rht-B1c differed from Rht-B1a by one 2kb Veju retrotransposon insertion, three coding region single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), one 197bp insertion, and four SNPs in the 1kb upstream sequence. Haplotype investigations, association analyses, transient expression assays, and expression profiling showed that the Veju insertion was primarily responsible for the extreme dwarfing effect. It was found that the Veju insertion changed processing of the Rht-B1c transcripts and resulted in DELLA motif primary structure disruption. Expression assays showed that Rht-B1c caused reduction of total Rht-1 transcript levels, and up-regulation of GATA-like transcription factors and genes positively regulated by these factors, suggesting that one way in which Rht-1 proteins affect plant growth and development is through GATA-like transcription factor regulation."

"24196805","abstracttext","Embryos in developing wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Sappo) grains (15-40 d post anthesis, dpa) contain no detectable α-amylase. When isolated from the grain they produce the enzyme even though they do not germinate. Younger (15 dpa) and older (45 dpa) embryos produce only a group of isozymes of low isoelectric point (pI): at intermediate ages low-pI and high-pI groups appear. The low-pI group is formed first, about 6 h after isolation, followed by the high-pI group at 16h. The formation of high-pI isoenzymes is prevented by abscisic acid and osmoticum, which also suppress the accumulation of high-pI mRNA. Almost all of the low-pI isoenzymes are unaffected by these two factors. Low-pI mRNA transcripts are present in embryos in situ but are not translated. Translation occurs when embryos are isolated, though there appears to be no further accumulation of low-pI mRNA. Addition of gibberellic acid to isolated embryos causes a great increase in accumulated high-pI mRNA, but only a small increase in low-pI message. Added gibberellic acid enables younger and older embryos to produce high-pI isoenzymes. The regulation of α-amylase gene expression and enzyme formation in developing embryos in situ is discussed in the light of these findings."

In the second year only the progenies of the early heading F5 lines were studied. All the material was grown in the absence of lodging. The culm-length genotypes of the different lines were identified by test crosses and by a seedling GA response test. No differences in grain weight were found between the two semi dwarf genotypes (Rht 1Rht1 rht 2rht2 and rht 1rht1 Rht 2Rht2). The tall genotype (rht 1rht1 rht 2rht2) was significantly higher in grain weight than the two semi dwarf genotyes and the grain weight of these genotypes exceeded markedly the grain weight of the dwarf genotype (Rht 1Rht1 Rht 2Rht2). These genotypic effects were independent of differences in plant height, heading date or number of grains per spike."

One regenerant was found which was heterozygous for a variant pattern characterized by the presence of at least five new isozyme bands, as well as an increased intensity in existing bands in two more positions. The F2 of a homozygous variant crossed back to the parent segregated in an approximate 3∶1 ratio but resolution of the gels was not sufficient to distinguish whether this represents a dominant or co-dominant single mutant gene. No chromosome abnormalities were evident in mitosis or meiosis of the homozygous variant or in the F1 of the variant crossed back to the parent. No recombination has been seen between the variant bands and production of multiple bands from a single locus is consistent with the nature of the known β-amylase loci. However, the variant bands were not evident in a survey of 111 diverse genotypes, nor were they present in developing grain of the parent cultivar. Therefore, this variant could represent a rare mutation leading to expression of a currently unexpressed locus."

The genetic parameters contributing to resistance were estimated by generation means analyses. Additive gene action was the most important genetic component of variation among generation means in all four crosses. Additive by additive effects were significant in one cross and both additive by additive and additive by dominance effects were significant in another. Dominance effects were not significant. The F2/F3 correlations in three crosses ranged from 0.27 to 0.43. Three additional crosses among resistant cultivars were employed to study the effectiveness of selection in improving resistance. By selecting the most resistant plants from the F2 and evaluating the progenies in the F4, increases in resistance ranging from 21% to 31% were obtained. In all crosses, there was transgressive segregation in both directions indicating that the genes conferring resistance to these cultivars differ and exhibit additive effects."

"24225835","abstracttext","Genetic variability of endosperm esterase has been studied in 42 cultivars of Triticum aestivum L. 2n=6x=42. Different techniques, including sequential electrophoresis and electrofocusing, have been used with various substrates and esterase inhibitors. The electrophoretic patterns in each cultivar are described. Chromosomal location using the nullitetrasomic and ditelosomic lines of Chinese Spring was carried out in order to relate and/or locate the esterase genes to specific chromosomes. Most of the esterase isozymes located were in the long arm of the chromosomes of the homoeology group 3; but we have found six located in the short arms, five of them in the chromosome 3AS and one in the 3DS. This location increases the number of esterase genes described, because no esterase genes had been described so far in short arms of chromosomes of the homoeology group 3. The genetic control is discussed and, according to our results, between 12 and 15 loci, organized in five ""compound loci"", control the endosperm esterases in wheat. Also one ""modifier"" gene modifying the mobility of two esterase bands and present in all the cultivars studied is postulated."

The objective of this research was to develop wheat lines monogenic for resistance to stem rust from 'Waldron' using allelism tests and tests for reaction to a series of ten stem rust cultures having a range of virulences. Twelve lines homozygous for single resistance genes were selected as parents of a diallel cross to test for allelism among genes for resistance. We identified 6 lines or groups of lines (WDR-A1, the WDR-B1 and WDR-B2 group, the WDR-C1 and WDR-C2 group, WDR-D1, the WDR-E1, WDR-E2, WDR-E3, and WDR-E4 group, and WDR-F1) that carried different single genes for resistance from 'Waldron'. A seventh line (WDR-G1) probably has two genes for resistance, one in common with WDR-C1 and WDR-C2. The gene in the WDR-E group is probably the same as SrWld1, and the one in WDR-F1 the same as Sri11. 'Waldron' probably has two or more genes for resistance to stem rust that previous genetic studies did not detect."

"24953696","abstracttext","Based on microarray analysis results of the salt tolerant wheat mutant, we identified and cloned an unknown salt-induced gene Ta-UnP (Triticum aestivum unknown protein). Quantitative PCR results revealed that Ta-UnP expression was induced not only by salt but also by polyethylene glycol, abscisic acid, and other environmental stress factors. Under salt stress, transgenic Arabidopsis plants that overexpressed Ta-UnP showed superior physiological properties (content of proline, soluble sugar, MDA, and chlorophyll) compared with the control. Subcellular localization demonstrated that Ta-UnP was mainly localized on the cell membrane. The expressions of nine salt tolerance-related genes of Arabidopsis in Ta-UnP-overexpressed Arabidopsis were analyzed via qPCR, and the results revealed that the expressions of SOS2, SOS3, RD29B, and P5CS were significantly up-regulated, whereas the other five genes only slightly changed. The results of the salt tolerance analysis indicated that Ta-UnP can enhance the salt tolerance of transgenic rice plants, and RNAi transgenic rice plants became highly susceptible to salt stress. The results from this study indicate that this novel Ta-UnP may be useful in improving of plant tolerance to salt stress."

His-SsCut was caused cell death in Arabidopsis, soybean (Glycine max), oilseed rape (Brassica napus), rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), indicating that both dicot and monocot species are responsive to the elicitor. Furthermore, the elicitation of tobacco was effective in the induction of the activities of hydrogen peroxide, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, peroxides, and polyphenol oxidase. His-SsCut-treated plants exhibited enhanced resistance as indicated by a significant reduction in the number and size of S. sclerotiorum, Phytophthora sojae, and P. nicotianae lesions on leaves relative to controls. Real-time PCR results indicated that the expression of defense-related genes and genes involved in signal transduction were induced by His-SsCut. Our results demonstrate that SsCut is an elicitor that triggers defense responses in plants and will help to clarify its relationship to downstream signaling pathways that induce defense responses."
"26295562","articletitle","Heritable alteration of DNA methylation induced by whole-chromosome aneuploidy in wheat."
"26295562","abstracttext","Aneuploidy causes changes in gene expression and phenotypes in all organisms studied. A previous study in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana showed that aneuploidy-generated phenotypic changes can be inherited to euploid progenies and implicated an epigenetic underpinning of the heritable variations. Based on an analysis by amplified fragment length polymorphism and methylation-sensitive amplified fragment length polymorphism markers, we found that although genetic changes at the nucleotide sequence level were negligible, extensive changes in cytosine DNA methylation patterns occurred in all studied homeologous group 1 whole-chromosome aneuploid lines of common wheat (Triticum aestivum), with monosomic 1A showing the greatest amount of methylation changes. The changed methylation patterns were inherited by euploid progenies derived from the aneuploid parents. The aneuploidy-induced DNA methylation alterations and their heritability were verified at selected loci by bisulfite sequencing. Our data have provided empirical evidence supporting earlier suggestions that heritability of aneuploidy-generated, but aneuploidy-independent, phenotypic variations may have an epigenetic basis. That at least one type of aneuploidy - monosomic 1A - was able to cause significant epigenetic divergence of the aneuploid plants and their euploid progenies also lends support to recent suggestions that aneuploidy may have played an important and protracted role in polyploid genome evolution."

"26000870","abstracttext","Intermediate wheatgrass (Thinopyrum intermedium (Host) Barkworth & D.R. Dewey), a segmental autoallohexaploid (2n = 6x = 42), is not only an important forage crop but also a valuable gene reservoir for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement. Throughout the scientific literature, there continues to be disagreement as to the origin of the different genomes in intermediate wheatgrass. Genotypic data obtained from newly developed EST-SSR primers derived from the putative progenitor diploid species Pseudoroegneria spicata (Pursh) Á. Löve (St genome), Thinopyrum bessarabicum (Savul. & Rayss) Á. Löve (J = J(b) = E(b)), and Thinopyrum elongatum (Host) D. Dewey (E = J(e) = E(e)) indicate that the V genome of Dasypyrum (Coss. & Durieu) T. Durand is not one of the three genomes in intermediate wheatgrass. Based on all available information in the literature and findings in this study, the genomic designation of intermediate wheatgrass should be changed to J(vs)J(r)St, where J(vs) and J(r) represent ancestral genomes of present-day J(b) of Th. bessarabicum and J(e) of Th. elongatum, with J(vs) being more ancient. Furthermore, the information suggests that the St genome in intermediate wheatgrass is most similar to the present-day St found in diploid species of Pseudoroegneria from Eurasia."

"25189240","abstracttext","Complete diallel crosses with five parents of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were conducted to analyse inheritance of 17 amino acid contents by using the genetic model including seed, cytoplasmic, maternal and environment interaction effects on quantitative traits of seeds in cereal crops. The results showed that inheritance of 17 amino acid contents, except tyrosine, was controlled by several genetic systems including seed, cytoplasmic, and maternal effects, and by significant gene x environment interaction effects. Seed-direct additive and maternal effects constituted a major part of genetic effects for lysine, tyrosine, arginine, methionine, and glutamic acid content. Seed-direct additive effect formed main part in inheritance of isoleucine and serine contents. Threonine content was mainly governed by maternal additive effect. The other nine amino acid contents were almost entirely controlled by dominance effects. High general heritability of tyrosine (36.3%), arginine (45.8%), lysine (24.7%) and threonine (21.4%) contents, revealed that it could be effective to improve them by direct selection in progenies from appropriate crosses. Interaction heritability for phenylalanine, proline, and histidine content, which was 36.1%, 39.5% and 25.7%, respectively, was higher than for the other amino acids."

"25299612","abstracttext","Drought is one of the most important factors limiting plant growth and development. We identified a gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under drought stress named TaFBA1. TaFBA1 encodes a putative 325-amino-acid F-box protein with a conserved N-terminal F-box domain and a C-terminal AMN1 domain. Real-time RT-PCR analysis revealed that TaFBA1 transcript accumulation was upregulated by high-salinity, water stress, and abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. To evaluate the functions of TaFBA1 in the regulation of drought stress responses, we produced transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing TaFBA1. Under water stress conditions, the transgenic tobacco plants had a higher germination rate, higher relative water content, net photosynthesis rate (Pn), less chlorophyll loss, and less growth inhibition than WT. These results demonstrate the high tolerance of the transgenic plants to drought stress compared to the WT. The enhanced oxidative stress tolerance of these plants, which may be involved in their drought tolerance, was indicated by their lower levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, MDA content, and cell membrane damage under drought stress compared to WT. The antioxidant enzyme activities were higher in the transgenic plants than in WT, which may be related to the upregulated expression of some antioxidant genes via overexpression of TaFBA1."

"25560188","abstracttext","In a previous study, we isolated and characterized TaMYB3R1, a MYB3R gene, from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). In vitro assays showed that the TaMYB3R1 protein is localized to the nucleus, and functions as an MSA-binding transcriptional activator. Expression of TaMYB3R1 is induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stress, which encouraged us to further investigate its function in planta. In the present study, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaMYB3R1. Compared with wild-type plants, the transgenic lines produced more rosette leaves, and thus more inflorescences, but the plants showed delayed development at the reproductive stage. The TaMYB3R1 protein also functions in the osmotic stress response. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants showed enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stresses, and the tolerance phenotype was conveyed by limiting transpiration through increasing stomatal closure as well as reducing water loss. In addition, TaMYB3R1 influenced the expression of both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent responsive genes, implicating TaMYB3R1 in diverse osmotic stress-response mechanisms in Arabidopsis. Our study sheds light on novel functions of a plant MYB3R protein."

"25644472","abstracttext","(E)-β-Farnesene (EβF) synthase catalyses the production of EβF, which for many aphids is the main or only component of the alarm pheromone causing the repellence of aphids and also functions as a kairomone for aphids' natural enemies. Many plants possess EβF synthase genes and can release EβF to repel aphids. In order to effectively recruit the plant-derived EβF synthase genes for aphid control, by using chloroplast transit peptide (CTP) of the small subunit of Rubisco (rbcS) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), we targeted AaβFS1, an EβF synthase gene from sweet wormwood (Artemisia annua L.), to the chloroplast of tobacco to generate CTP + AaβFS1 transgenic lines. The CTP + AaβFS1 transgenic tobacco plants could emit EβF at a level up to 19.25 ng/day per g fresh tissues, 4-12 fold higher than the AaβFS1 transgenic lines without chloroplast targeting. Furthermore, aphid/parasitoid behavioral bioassays demonstrated that the CTP + AaβFS1 transgenic tobacco showed enhanced repellence to green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) and attracted response of its parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae, thus affecting aphid infestation at two trophic levels. These data suggest that the chloroplast is an ideal subcellular compartment for metabolic engineering of plant-derived EβF synthase genes to generate a novel type of transgenic plant emitting an alarm pheromone for aphid control."

"25649735","abstracttext","Inorganic nitrogen (N) is a key limiting factor of the agricultural productivity. Nitrogen utilization efficiency has significant impact on crop growth and yield as well as on the reduction in production cost. The excessive nitrogen application is accompanied with severe negative impact on environment. Thus to reduce the environmental contamination, improving NUE is need of an hour. In our study we have deployed comparative proteome analysis using 2-DE to investigate the effect of the nitrogen nutrition on differential expression pattern of leaf proteins in low-N sensitive and low-N tolerant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties. Results showed a comprehensive picture of the post-transcriptional response to different nitrogen regimes administered which would be expected to serve as a basic platform for further characterization of gene function and regulation. We detected proteins related to photosynthesis, glycolysis, nitrogen metabolism, sulphur metabolism and defence. Our results provide new insights towards the altered protein pattern in response to N stress. Through this study we suggest that genes functioning in many physiological events coordinate the response to availability of nitrogen and also for the improvement of NUE of crops."

"25989474","abstracttext","Starch phosphate ester content is known to alter the physicochemical properties of starch, including its susceptibility to degradation. Previous work producing wheat (Triticum aestivum) with down-regulated glucan, water dikinase, the primary gene responsible for addition of phosphate groups to starch, in a grain-specific manner found unexpected phenotypic alteration in grain and growth. Here, we report on further characterization of these lines focussing on mature grain and early growth. We find that coleoptile length has been increased in these transgenic lines independently of grain size increases. No changes in starch degradation rates during germination could be identified, or any major alteration in soluble sugar levels that may explain the coleoptile growth modification. We identify some alteration in hormones in the tissues in question. Mature grain size is examined, as is Hardness Index and starch conformation. We find no evidence that the increased growth of coleoptiles in these lines is connected to starch conformation or degradation or soluble sugar content and suggest these findings provide a novel means of increasing coleoptile growth and early seedling establishment in cereal crop species."

"26556651","abstracttext","Barley, wheat, rice and maize provide the bulk of human nutrition and have extensive industrial use as agricultural products. The genomes of these crops each contains >40,000 genes encoding proteins; however, the major genome databases for these species lack annotation information of protein subcellular location for >80% of these gene products. We address this gap, by constructing the compendium of crop protein subcellular locations called crop Proteins with Annotated Locations (cropPAL). Subcellular location is most commonly determined by fluorescent protein tagging of live cells or mass spectrometry detection in subcellular purifications, but can also be predicted from amino acid sequence or protein expression patterns. The cropPAL database collates 556 published studies, from >300 research institutes in >30 countries that have been previously published, as well as compiling eight pre-computed subcellular predictions for all Hordeum vulgare, Triticum aestivum, Oryza sativa and Zea mays protein sequences. The data collection including metadata for proteins and published studies can be accessed through a search portal http://crop-PAL.org. The subcellular localization information housed in cropPAL helps to depict plant cells as compartmentalized protein networks that can be investigated for improving crop yield and quality, and developing new biotechnological solutions to agricultural challenges."

"27717481","abstracttext","Q-type C 2 H 2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are plant-specific DNA-binding proteins containing a conserved QALGGH motif. This study investigated the function of abiotic stress-inducible and predominantly root-expressed Triticum aestivum ZFPs (TaZFP22, TaZFP34 and TaZFP46) with a focus on TaZFP34. Expression of TaZFP34 in roots was upregulated by high salinity, dehydration, oxidative and cold stresses. Overexpression of TaZFP34 in wheat roots resulted in an increased root-to-shoot ratio, a phenomenon observed during plant adaptation to drying soil. Expression of a number of genes which are potentially involved in modulating root growth was significantly altered in the roots of TaZFP34 overexpressing lines. In particular, the transcript levels of TaRR12B, TaRR12D and TaSHY2 that are homologues of known negative regulators of root growth were significantly reduced. Expression of shoot growth-related genes, such as GA3-ox and expansins, was downregulated in the transgenic shoots. TaZFP34 bound to (C/G)AGT(G/A)-like elements in the promoters of TaZFP34 down-regulated TaRR12D and TaSHY2 and transrepressed the reporter gene expression driven by TaRR12D and TaSHY2 promoters. Expression of the above reporter genes was also repressed by TaZFP46 and TaZFP22. These data suggest that TaZFP34 is a transcriptional repressor and is involved in modulating the root-to-shoot ratio."

Plant roots, important organs for absorbing nutrients and synthesizing growth regulators, are good candidates for P-efficiency screening. In this study, we evaluated five root traits under hydroponic culture conditions either with (AP) or without (NP) applied P in a recombinant inbred line population (H461/CM107) of Triticum aestivum L. at the seedling stage. Four significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected, on chromosomes 1D, 2D, 3D, and 7D in NP-treated plants, explaining up to 13.0%, 11.0%, 14.4%, and 12.8% of the phenotypic variance, respectively. Among these QTL, Qrt.sicau-3D and Qrt.sicau-7D showed pleiotropic and additive effects. All QTL were found to be novel. The diversity array technology markers flanking the QTL were converted to simple sequence repeat markers that can be deployed in future genetic studies of P deficiency. These QTL lead to an increase in root biomass and respond to P-deficiency stress; these characteristics are crucial to improve root traits for breeding or further investigation of the gene(s) involved in P-deficiency tolerance."

"28860643","abstracttext","The molecular details of local plant response against Xanthomonas translucens infection is largely unknown. Moreover, there is no knowledge about effects of the pathogen on the root's transcriptome and proteome. Therefore, we investigated the global gene and protein expression changes both in leaves and roots of wheat (Triticum aestivum) 24 h post leaf infection of X. translucens. This simultaneous analysis allowed us to obtain insight into possible metabolic rearrangements in above- and belowground tissues and to identify common responses as well as specific alterations. At the site of infection, we observed the implication of various components of the recognition, signaling, and amplification mechanisms in plant response to the pathogen. Moreover, data indicate a massive down-regulation of photosynthesis and confirm the chloroplast as crucial signaling hub during pathogen attack. Notably, roots responded as well to foliar attack and their response significantly differed from that locally triggered in infected leaves. Data indicate that roots as a site of energy production and synthesis of various secondary metabolites may actively influence the composition and colonisation level of root-associated microbes. Finally, our results emphasize the accumulation of jasmonic acid, pipecolic acid and/or the downstream mediator of hydrogen peroxide as long distal signals from infected leaves to roots."

"32645965","abstracttext","TaCKX , Triticum aestivum (cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase) family genes influence the development of wheat plants by the specific regulation of cytokinin content in different organs. However, their detailed role is not known. The TaCKX1 , highly and specifically expressed in developing spikes and in seedling roots, was silenced by RNAi-mediated gene silencing via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and the effect of silencing was investigated in 7 DAP (days after pollination) spikes of T 1 and T 2 generations. Various levels of TaCKX1 silencing in both generations influence different models of co-expression with other TaCKX genes and parameters of yield-related traits. Only a high level of silencing in T 2 resulted in strong down-regulation of TaCKX11 (3) , up-regulation of TaCKX2.1 , 2.2 , 5, and 9 ( 10 ), and a high yielding phenotype. This phenotype is characterized by a higher spike number, grain number, and grain yield, but lower thousand grain weight (TGW). The content of most of cytokinin forms in 7 DAP spikes of silenced T 2 lines increased from 23% to 76% compared to the non-silenced control. The CKs cross talk with other phytohormones. Each of the tested yield-related traits is regulated by various up- or down-regulated TaCKX genes and phytohormones.

"30949857","abstracttext","Simulating drought stress during the breeding process has been proposed as a way to select varieties under naturally non-stressful conditions. The aim of the study was to characterise the genetic basis of the response of 111 spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties and landraces to chemical desiccation and to rain-out shelter drought. The effect of the rain-out shelter was a 15% reduction in plant height, spike length and thousand seed weight (TSW); in contrast, the desiccant treatment induced a 15% reduction in seed number, a 35-72% loss in TSW and a reduction in subsequent germination of 12%. A genome-wide association analysis revealed 263 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs), of which 246 involved days to anthesis, plant height, spike length, number of spikelets, seed number, TSW and germination from the non-treated plants. Only four and five MTAs involved TSW from plants grown under the rain-out shelter and the chemical desiccation, respectively, and harboured the Sugar-Dependent6 gene. Seven MTAs involved seed number for chemical desiccated plants. Both, chemical desiccation and rain-out shelter drought identified same tolerant genotypes. Concluding, both approaches are suitable to simulate different drought scenarios. However, there was a strong environmental impact for chemical desiccation which may increase the complexity of this tolerance mechanism."

"32409318","abstracttext","Genetic engineering of cis -regulatory elements in crop plants is a promising strategy to ensure food security. However, such engineering is currently hindered by our limited knowledge of plant cis -regulatory elements. Here, we adapted self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (STARR-seq)-a technology for the high-throughput identification of enhancers-for its use in transiently transformed tobacco ( Nicotiana benthamiana ) leaves. We demonstrate that the optimal placement in the reporter construct of enhancer sequences from a plant virus, pea ( Pisum sativum ) and wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), was just upstream of a minimal promoter and that none of these four known enhancers was active in the 3' untranslated region of the reporter gene. The optimized assay sensitively identified small DNA regions containing each of the four enhancers, including two whose activity was stimulated by light. Furthermore, we coupled the assay to saturation mutagenesis to pinpoint functional regions within an enhancer, which we recombined to create synthetic enhancers. Our results describe an approach to define enhancer properties that can be performed in potentially any plant species or tissue transformable by Agrobacterium and that can use regulatory DNA derived from any plant genome."

The present study focuses on leaf rust fungi Puccinia triticina (Pathotype 77-5) mediated RNAi to make wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) more susceptible. To reach such conclusions, we first confirmed the presence of argonaute (AGO) and dicer-like protein (DCL) family sequences in Puccinia. Bioinformatic tools were applied to retrieve the sequences from Puccinia genome followed by cloning and sequencing from P. triticina pathotype 77-5 cDNA to obtain the specific sequences.

Resistance was measured quantitatively and qualitatively using a SPAD meter and visual assessments, respectively. We identified a large effect resistance gene on chromosome arm 7DL of Sokoll, herein referred as GbSkl , which contributed up to 24% of the phenotypic variation. Other minor QTL on chromosomes 2B, 3A, and 7B were also identified. The QTL on 2B and 3A originated from Weebill1. Of the Sokoll derived germplasm, 13% displayed resistance. Allelism tests indicated that GbSkl could be allelic or tightly linked to the temporarily designated genes Gba , Gbb , and Gbd . Utility of SPAD to determine quantitative variation in resistance phenotyping is demonstrated and breeding efforts are underway to transfer the resistance from Sokoll to new CIMMYT elite germplasm."

"31626703","abstracttext","Phyllosphere is a habitat to a variety of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms, which play a fundamental role in maintaining the health of plants and mediating the interaction between plants and ambient environments. A recent addition to this catalogue of microbial diversity was the aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs (AAPs), a group of widespread bacteria that absorb light through bacteriochlorophyll α (BChl a) to produce energy without fixing carbon or producing molecular oxygen. However, culture representatives of AAPs from phyllosphere and their genome information are lacking, limiting our capability to assess their potential ecological roles in this unique niche. In this study, we investigated the presence of AAPs in the phyllosphere of a winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in Denmark by employing bacterial colony based infrared imaging and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (MS) techniques. A total of ∼4,480 colonies were screened for the presence of cellular BChl a, resulting in 129 AAP isolates that were further clustered into 21 groups based on MALDI-TOF MS profiling, representatives of which were sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq and Oxford Nanopore MinION platforms. Seventeen draft and four complete genomes of AAPs were assembled belonging in Methylobacterium, Rhizobium, Roseomonas, and a novel Alsobacter. We observed a diverging pattern in the evolutionary rates of photosynthesis genes among the highly homogenous AAP strains of Methylobacterium (Alphaproteobacteria), highlighting an ongoing genomic innovation at the gene cluster level."

"31325695","abstracttext","Nanoparticles (NP) bioactivity is under deep scrutiny. In this work, the antioxidant response to TiO 2 -NP in wheat (Triticum aestivum) was determined. For that, enzymatic and the non-enzymatic antioxidants were evaluated in plants exposed to the P25 anatase:rutile material composed of TiO 2 -NP and under environmentally realistic doses (0; 5; 50; 150 mg/L for 20 days). Shoot but not root growth was reduced. In leaves, thiol metabolism and ascorbate accumulation were the preferred route whereas in roots the pre-existing antioxidant capacity was preferentially utilized. Both leaves and roots showed increased glutathione reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase activities and decreased ascorbate peroxidase activity. Roots, nevertheless, presented higher enzymatic basal levels than leaves. On the other hand, when examining non-enzymatic antioxidants, the ratio of reduced-to-oxidized glutathione (GSH/GSSG) increased in leaves and decreased in roots. Exposed leaves also presented higher total ascorbate accumulation compared to roots. TiO 2 -NP exposure down regulated, with more prominence in roots, antioxidant enzyme genes encoding catalase, ascorbate peroxidase, monodehydroascorbate reductase and dehydroascorbate reductase. In leaves, superoxide dismutase gene expression was increased. All data pinpoint to TiO 2 -NP toxicity above 5 mg/L, with aerial parts being more susceptible, which draws concerns on the safety doses for the use of these NPs in agricultural practices."

In the current study, native bacterial community composition and diversity colonizing Triticum aestivum L. rhizosphere at two distant geographical locations including Mirpur Azad Kashmir and Islamabad was elucidated. Based on IonS5™XL platform sequencing of respective samples targeting 16S rRNA gene that harbor V3-V4 conserved region revealed 1364 and 1254 microbial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at ≥97% similarity and were classified into 23, 20 phyla; 70, 65 classes; 101, 87 orders; 189,180 families; 275, 271 genera and 94, 95 species. Respective predominant phyla accounting for 97.90% and 98.60% of bacterial community were Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chloroflexi and Gemmatimonadetes. Diversity indices revealed variations in relative abundance of bacterial taxa owing to distant geographical locations however predominant bacterial taxa at both locations were similar. These findings paved a way to dissect consequence of associated microbiota on future wheat production system."

"32689244","abstracttext","Plants possess multiple homologues of the SKP1 gene encoding an essential subunit of the SCF ubiquitin ligases, but only ASK1 (Arabidopsis SKP1-like 1) and ASK2 have been characterised genetically. In addition, little is known about the function of SKP1 homologues in monocots. Here we report on a winter wheat homologue of SKP1 named TSK1 (Triticum aestivum SKP1-like 1). Expression analyses revealed that it was expressed predominantly in young roots and floral buds. RNA in situ hybridisation showed that it was expressed in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and anthers, especially the tapetum and microsporocytes at the time of meiosis. It was also expressed in almost the entire meristematic and elongation zones of the root. These observations indicated that TSK1 might function in dividing cells. The Arabidopsis ask1-1 mutant with overexpressed TSK1 driven by the CaMV 35S promoter exhibited partial fertility, suggesting that TSK1 could partially restore function in meiosis to the ask1-1 mutant. In addition, overexpression of TSK1 in wild type Arabidopsis resulted in changes in auxin responses and auxin-related phenotypes, consistent with a role of ASK1 in Arabidopsis auxin response. These results suggest possible functional conservation between TSK1 and ASK1."

"33302868","abstracttext_background","Previous studies have shown that ABFs (abscisic acid-responsive transcription factors) are important ABA-signaling components that participate in abiotic stress response. However, little is known about the function of ABFs in Triticum aestivum. In addition, although various ABFs have been identified in other species, the phylogenetic relationship between ABF transcription factors has not been systemically investigated in land plants."
"33302868","abstracttext_results","In this study, we systemically collected ABFs from land plants and analyzed the phylogenetic relationship of these ABF genes. The ABF genes are present in all the land plants we investigated, including moss, lycophyte, monocots, and eudicots. Furthermore, these ABF genes are phylogenetically divided into seven subgroups, differentiations that are supported by variation in the gene structure, protein properties, and motif patterns. We further demonstrated that the expression of ABF genes varies among different tissues and developmental stages, and are induced by one or more environmental stresses. Furthermore, we found that three wheat ABFs (TaABF1, TaABF2, and TaABF3) were significantly induced by drought stress. Compared with wild-type (WT) plants, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaABF3 displayed enhanced drought tolerance."

"9391173","abstracttext","5'-End fragments of two genes encoding plastid-localized acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACCase; EC 6.4.1.2) of wheat (Triticum aestivum) were cloned and sequenced. The sequences of the two genes, Acc-1,1 and Acc-1,2, are 89% identical. Their exon sequences are 98% identical. The amino acid sequence of the biotin carboxylase domain encoded by Acc-1,1 and Acc-1,2 is 93% identical with the maize plastid ACCase but only 80-84% identical with the cytosolic ACCases from other plants and from wheat. Four overlapping fragments of cDNA covering the entire coding region were cloned by PCR and sequenced. The wheat plastid ACCase ORF contains 2,311 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 255 kDa. A putative transit peptide is present at the N terminus. Comparison of the genomic and cDNA sequences revealed introns at conserved sites found in the genes of other plant multifunctional ACCases, including two introns absent from the wheat cytosolic ACCase genes. Transcription start sites of the plastid ACCase genes were estimated from the longest cDNA clones obtained by 5'-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends). The untranslated leader sequence encoded by the Acc-1 genes is at least 130-170 nucleotides long and is interrupted by an intron. Southern analysis indicates the presence of only one copy of the gene in each ancestral chromosome set. The gene maps near the telomere on the short arm of chromosomes 2A, 2B, and 2D. Identification of three different cDNAs, two corresponding to genes Acc-1,1 and Acc-1,2, indicates that all three genes are transcriptionally active."

"14628111","abstracttext","The objective of this research was to identify Fusarium head blight (FHB) resistance in wheat ( Triticum aestivum)- Lophopyrum genetic lines that might complement FHB resistance in common wheat; and to identify DNA markers that can be used to tag the resistance gene in the alien chromatin (E or el(2) genome) for the development of improved wheat cultivars. FHB resistance was evaluated in 19 Chinese Spring- Lophopyrum elongatum (EE) substitution lines, two Thatcher -L. ponticum (el(1) and el(2)) substitution lines, and four Thatcher- L. ponticum translocation lines. Significant resistance was identified in the substitution lines 7E(7A), 7E(7B), and 7E(7D). The homoeologous chromosome, 7el(2),()also showed resistance in the Thatcher genetic background. Both the Thatcher-7el(1) substitution and translocation lines were susceptible, like Thatcher, indicating that there is no resistance gene on the 7el(1) chromosome. Simple sequence repeat (SSR) and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS) in homoeologous group 7 chromosomes were used to identify DNA markers located on 7E and 7el(2). As expected, the transferability of wheat SSR markers to Lophopyrum is low. Of the 52 SSR markers that we tested, only five were found to be co-dominant on 7E of L. elongatum versus 7A, 7B, and 7D, one of which is also positive on 7el(2). A CAPS marker, derived from the RFLP probe PSR129, can serve as a dominant marker for 7el(2) chromatin."

"18267946","abstracttext","The manipulation of cytokinin levels by senescence-regulated expression of the Agrobacterium tumefaciens ipt gene through its control by the Arabidopsis SAG12 (senescence-associated gene 12) promoter is an efficient tool for the prolongation of leaf photosynthetic activity which potentially can affect plant productivity. In the present study, the efficiency of this approach was tested on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-a monocarpic plant characterized by a fast switch from vegetative to reproductive growth, and rapid translocation of metabolites from leaves to developing grains after anthesis. When compared with the wild-type (WT) control plants, the SAG12::ipt wheat plants exhibited delayed chlorophyll degradation only when grown under limited nitrogen (N) supply. Ten days after anthesis the content of chlorophyll and bioactive cytokinins of the first (flag) leaf of the transgenic plants was 32% and 65% higher, respectively, than that of the control. There was a progressive increase in nitrate influx and nitrate reductase activity. However, the SAG12::ipt and the WT plants did not show differences in yield-related parameters including number of grains and grain weight. These results suggest that the delay of leaf senescence in wheat also delays the translocation of metabolites from leaves to developing grains, as indicated by higher accumulation of ((15)N-labelled) N in spikes of control compared with transgenic plants prior to anthesis. This delay interferes with the wheat reproductive strategy that is based on a fast programmed translocation of metabolites from the senescing leaves to the reproductive sinks shortly after anthesis."
"16653076","articletitle","Characterization of a Cold-Regulated Wheat Gene Related to Arabidopsis cor47."
"16653076","abstracttext","The cDNA clone pWG1 represents a gene, designated cor39, from Triticum aestivum L. cv Winoka (a winter wheat) that is related to a cold-regulated Arabidopsis thaliana L. (Heyn) gene, cor47. In vitro transcription/translation experiments in conjunction with DNA sequence analysis indicated that cor39 encodes a hydrophilic polypeptide of 39 kD (isoelectric point of 7.5), designated COR39. The polypeptide is composed primarily of two sequences, each of which is repeated six times. One sequence, which is lysine rich, occurs in COR47 (the polypeptide encoded by Arabidopsis cor47) and group II LEA proteins, polypeptides hypothesized to have roles in desiccation and drought tolerance (J. Baker, C. Steele, L. Dure III [1988] Plant Mol Biol 11: 277-291). The second sequence, which is glycine rich, occurs in some, but not all, group II LEA proteins. Southern analysis indicated that wheat has a number of loci related to cor39. Transcripts of about 3.3, 1.5, and 0.8 kb that hybridize with cor39 were found to accumulate in leaf, root, and crown tissues of cold-acclimated plants; they accumulated rapidly in response to low temperature and returned quickly to low levels when plants were returned to normal growth temperature. Transcripts hybridizing with cor39 were present at relatively high levels in wheat seeds and accumulated in plants in response to exogenous application of ABA and water stress. The similarities in expression of wheat and Arabidopsis cor genes and possible functional relationships among COR39, COR47, and LEA proteins are discussed."

"18705862","abstracttext","Stripe rust [caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Eriks. (Pst)] is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. High-temperature adult-plant (HTAP) resistance to stripe rust is race non-specific, inherited quantitatively and durable. Previously, we identified and mapped the single Yr39 HTAP stripe rust resistance gene in the spring wheat cultivar Alpowa, which was identified on chromosome 7BL and accounted for 64.2% of the variation in resistance. To identify transcripts associated with Yr39-mediated resistance, we selected two F(7 )recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from an 'Avocet S/Alpowa' cross that differed at the Yr39 locus to represent an incompatible (Yr39) and compatible (yr39) interaction with Pst. Using the Affymetrix Wheat GeneChip, we profiled the transcript changes occurring in flag leaves of these two RILs over a time-course after treatment with Pst urediniospores and mock-inoculation. This time-course study identified 99 induced transcripts that were classified as HTAP resistance-specific. The temporal pattern of transcript accumulation showed a peak at 48 h after infection, which was supported by microscopic observation of fungal development and quantitative PCR assays that showed a rapid increase in fungal biomass after this time in the compatible interaction. More than half (50.5%) of the annotated transcripts specifically induced during HTAP resistance were involved in defence and/or signal transduction, including R gene homologues and transcripts associated with pathogenesis-related protein production, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and protein kinase signalling. This study represents the first transcript profiling of HTAP resistance to stripe rust in wheat, and we compare our results with other transcript studies of race-specific and race non-specific resistance."

"16970616","abstracttext","A wheat-Dasypyrum breviaristatum partial amphiploid and its derivatives were analyzed by molecular cytological observation and tested for disease resistance in order to evaluate the potential use of the D. breviaristatum for wheat improvement. A fertility-improved partial amphiploid, TDH-2, was produced from the selfing population of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese spring (CS)-D. breviaristatum amphiploid. Based on the results obtained from genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and seed protein electrophoresis, we found the presence of fourteen D. breviaristatum chromosomes and the absence of D genome in TDH-2, indicating that the genomic composition of TDH-2 was AABBV(b)V(b). GISH analysis on BC(1)F(4) progenies of TDH-2xwheat demonstrated that alien D. breviaristatum chromosomes or segments were frequently transmitted. A survey of diseases resistance revealed that powdery mildew resistance from D. breviaristatum was totally expressed, however, the expression of stripe rust resistance from D. breviaristatum was dependent on the wheat background. The comparison of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which was carried out using molecular marker SCAR(1400) linked to Pm21 D. villosum-derived powdery mildew resistance gene, suggested that D. breviaristatum possessed new resistance gene(s) different from that in D. villosum. The present study showed that the partial amphiploid TDH-2 and its derivatives could serve as novel sources for transfer of disease resistance genes to wheat."

"20306118","abstracttext","We previously reported that transgenic wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) carrying a maize (Zea mays L.) gene (Zmeftu1) for chloroplast protein synthesis elongation factor, EF-Tu, displays reduced thermal aggregation of leaf proteins, reduced injury to photosynthetic membranes (thylakoids), and enhanced rate of CO(2) fixation following exposure to heat stress (18 h at 45 degrees C) [Fu et al. in Plant Mol Biol 68:277-288, 2008]. In the current study, we investigated the segregation pattern and expression of the transgene Zmeftu1 and determined the grain yield of transgenic plants after exposure to a brief heat stress (18 h at 45 degrees C). We also assessed thermal aggregation of soluble leaf proteins in transgenic plants, testing the hypothesis that increased levels of EF-Tu will lead to a non-specific protection of leaf proteins against thermal aggregation. The transgenic wheat displayed a single-gene pattern of segregation of Zmeftu1. Zmeftu1 was expressed, and the transgenic plants synthesized and accumulated three anti-EF-Tu cross-reacting polypeptides of similar molecular mass but different pI, suggesting the possibility of posttranslational modification of this protein. The transgenic plants also showed better grain yield after exposure to heat stress compared with their non-transgenic counterparts. Soluble leaf proteins of various molecular masses displayed lower thermal aggregation in transgenic than in non-transgenic wheat. The results suggest that overexpression of chloroplast EF-Tu can be beneficial to wheat tolerance to heat stress. Moreover, the results also support the hypothesis that EF-Tu contributes to heat tolerance by acting as a molecular chaperone and protecting heat-labile proteins from thermal aggregation in a non-specific manner."

"20526575","abstracttext","Thinopyrum intermedium translocations derived from the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) substitution line P-29 were previously characterized by RFLP. We have further analyzed these lines and additional related germplasm with publicly available STS and SSRs. Primers which showed a polymorphism between wheat and P-29, were tested in all recombinant and nulli-tetrasomic lines confirming their position on chromosome 7D. The resulting 7D/7E chromosome maps appeared as a mosaic of wheat and Th. intermedium chromatin sections. To verify the composition of the translocation lines suggested by the RFLP-PCR map, F(2) progeny of two crosses (CS/216-1 and CS/260-1) were analyzed with molecular markers. Both populations gave an unexpectedly diverse number of recombinant individuals, suggesting that interstitial translocations occur more frequently than previously thought. This analysis also showed that there is a wide range in the number and position of the interstitial translocations within a given line such as the mosaic chromosome in recombinant line 260-1/CS-26, which has four Th. intermedium chromosome segments. Phenotypic data of the two populations suggested the presence of one gene which we have called Bdv3 to differentiate it from the previously reported orthologous gene Bdv2. Using the PCR-based molecular markers identified in this study, 5 out of 12 elite lines that showed good yields and no YDV symptoms contained Th. intermedium chromatin. Due to the multiple components involved in the YDV disease complex, combining selection for YDV resistance with the molecular markers and maps identified in this study will increase the efficiency of introgressing Th. intermedium chromatin containing YDV resistance or other beneficial traits into elite wheat germplasm."

"20565667","abstracttext","SUMMARY Both yield and grain-quality are dramatically decreased when susceptible wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants are infested by Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) larvae. Examination of the changes in wheat gene expression during infestation by virulent Hessian fly larvae has identified the up-regulation of a gene, Hessian fly responsive-2 (Hfr-2), which contains regions similar to genes encoding seed-specific agglutinin proteins from Amaranthus. Hfr-2, however, did not accumulate in developing seeds, as do other wheat seed storage proteins. Additionally, a separate region of the HFR-2 predicted amino acid sequence is similar to haemolytic proteins, from both mushroom and bacteria, that are able to form pores in cell membranes of mammalian red blood cells. The involvement of Hfr-2 in interactions with insects was supported by experiments demonstrating its up-regulation by both fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda) and bird cherry-oat aphid (Rhopalosiphum padi) infestations but not by virus infection. Examination of wheat defence response pathways showed Hfr-2 up-regulation following methyl jasmonate treatment and only slight up-regulation in response to salicylic acid, abscisic acid and wounding treatments. Like related proteins, HFR-2 may normally function in defence against certain insects or pathogens. However, we propose that as virulent Hessian fly larvae manipulate the physiology of the susceptible host, the HFR-2 protein inserts in plant cell membranes at the feeding sites and by forming pores provides water, ions and other small nutritive molecules to the developing larvae."

"25852661","abstracttext","The present study was conducted to characterize the native plant growth promoting (PGP) bacteria from wheat rhizosphere and root-endosphere in the Himalayan region of Rawalakot, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Pakistan. Nine bacterial isolates were purified, screened in vitro for PGP characteristics and evaluated for their beneficial effects on the early growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Among nine bacterial isolates, seven were able to produce indole-3- acetic acid in tryptophan-supplemented medium; seven were nitrogen fixer, and four were able to solubilize inorganic phosphate in vitro. Four different morphotypes were genotypically identified based on IGS-RFLP fingerprinting and representative of each morphotype was identified by 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis except Gram-positive putative Bacillus sp. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis, bacterial isolates AJK-3 and AJK-9 showing multiple PGP-traits were identified as Stenotrophomonas spp. while AJK-7 showed equal homologies to Acetobacter pasteurianus and Stenotrophomonas specie. Plant inoculation studies indicated that these Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) strains provided a significant increase in shoot and root length, and shoot and root biomass. A significant increase in shoot N contents (up to 76%) and root N contents (up to 32%) was observed over the un-inoculated control. The study indicates the potential of these PGPR for inoculums production or biofertilizers for enhancing growth and nutrient content of wheat and other crops under field conditions. The study is the first report of wheat associated bacterial diversity in the Himalayan region of Rawalakot, AJK."

"25819752","abstracttext","Arabinoxylan (AX) is the dominant component within wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) endosperm cell walls, accounting for 70% of the polysaccharide. The viscosity of aqueous extracts from wheat grain is a key trait influencing the processing for various end uses, and this is largely determined by the properties of endosperm AX. We have previously shown dramatic effects on endosperm AX in transgenic wheat by down-regulating either TaGT43_2 or TaGT47_2 genes (orthologues to IRX9 and IRX10 in Arabidopsis, respectively) implicated in AX chain extension and the TaXAT1 gene responsible for monosubstitution by 3-linked arabinose. Here, we use these transgenic lines to investigate the relationship between amounts of AX in soluble and insoluble fractions, the chain-length distribution of these measured by intrinsic viscosity and the overall effect on extract viscosity. In transgenic lines expressing either the TaGT43_2 or TaGT47_2 RNAi transgenes, the intrinsic viscosities of water-extractable (WE-AX) and of a water-insoluble alkaline-extracted fraction (AE-AX) were decreased by between 10% and 50% compared to control lines. In TaXAT1 RNAi lines, there was a 15% decrease in intrinsic viscosity of WE-AX but no consistent effect on that of AE-AX. All transgenic lines showed decreases in extract viscosity with larger effects in TaGT43_2 and TaGT47_2 RNAi lines (by up to sixfold) than in TaXAT1 RNAi lines (by twofold). These effects were explained by the decreases in amount and chain length of WE-AX, with decreases in amount having the greater influence. Extract viscosity from wheat grain can therefore be greatly decreased by suppression of single gene targets."

"29053643","abstracttext","The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade is a universal signal transduction module that plays a vital role in regulating growth and development, as well as environmental stress responses in plants. Wheat is one of the most important crops worldwide. Although the MAPK kinase kinase (MAP3K) family in wheat has been investigated, the MAPK and MAPK kinase (MAP2K) gene families remain unknown at present. Here, 54 MAPK and 18 MAPKK genes were identified in wheat using recent genomic information. Phylogenetic analysis of Triticum aestivum L. MAPKs and MAPKKs ( TaMAPKs and TaMAPKKs) together with homologous genes from other species classified them into four groups, and the clustering was consistent with the genomic exon/intron structures. Conserved motif analysis found that MAPK proteins contained a typical TXY phosphorylation site and MAPKK proteins contained an S/T-X5-S/T motif. RNA-seq data mapping analysis showed that MAPK and MAPKK genes in group IV had tissue-specific expression profiles, whereas each group I member showed relatively high expression in all organs. Expression patterns of TaMAPK and TaMAPKK genes under stress conditions were also investigated and stress-responsive candidates were identified. Co-expression network analysis identified 11 TaMAPK genes and 6 TaMAPKK genes involved in the interaction network pathway. Overall, this study provided useful information for evolutionary and functional surveys of MAPK and MAPKK gene families in wheat and beyond."

"32184345","abstracttext","Disease resistance genes encoding nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) intracellular immune receptor proteins detect pathogens by the presence of pathogen effectors. Plant genomes typically contain hundreds of NLR-encoding genes. The availability of the hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) cultivar Chinese Spring reference genome allows a detailed study of its NLR complement. However, low NLR expression and high intrafamily sequence homology hinder their accurate annotation. Here, we developed NLR-Annotator, a software tool for in silico NLR identification independent of transcript support. Although developed for wheat, we demonstrate the universal applicability of NLR-Annotator across diverse plant taxa. We applied our tool to wheat and combined it with a transcript-validated subset of genes from the reference gene annotation to characterize the structure, phylogeny, and expression profile of the NLR gene family. We detected 3,400 full-length NLR loci, of which 1,560 were confirmed as expressed genes with intact open reading frames. NLRs with integrated domains mostly group in specific subclades. Members of another subclade predominantly locate in close physical proximity to NLRs carrying integrated domains, suggesting a paired helper function. Most NLRs (88%) display low basal expression (in the lower 10 percentile of transcripts). In young leaves subjected to biotic stress, we found up-regulation of 266 of the NLRs To illustrate the utility of our tool for the positional cloning of resistance genes, we estimated the number of NLR genes within the intervals of mapped rust resistance genes. Our study will support the identification of functional resistance genes in wheat to accelerate the breeding and engineering of disease-resistant varieties."

Gene ontology enrichments, k-means analysis and KEGG pathway analysis indicated that 94M370 plants containing the Dn7 D. noxia resistance gene from rye had stronger effects on the global transcriptional profiles of S. graminum and D. noxia relative to those fed Dn4 plants. S. graminum responds to ingestion of phloem sap from 94M370 plants by expression of unigenes coding for proteins involved in DNA and RNA repair, and delayed tissue and structural development. In contrast, D. noxia displays a completely different transcriptome after ingesting phloem sap from Dn4 or 94M370 plants, consisting of unigenes involved primarily in detoxification, nutrient acquisition and structural development. These variations in transcriptional responses of D. noxia and S. graminum suggest that the underlying evolutionary mechanism(s) of virulence in these aphids are likely species specific, even in cases of cross resistance."

"30172303","abstracttext","This study reports the introduction of egfp or mCherry markers to the Sp245, Sp7, and M40 wild-type strains of Azospirillum brasilense and the hhkB (encoding for a putative hybrid histidine kinase) minus mutant an isogenic strain of A. brasilense Sp245 to monitor colonization of wheat (Triticum aestivum). Two plasmids were constructed: (1) the pJMS-2 suicide plasmid derived from pSUP202 and harboring the mCherry gene expressed under the constitutive kanamycin resistance promoter to create a cis tag and (2) the broad-range plasmid pMP2449-5 that carries the mCherry gene under the lac promoter, which is derived from the plasmid pMP2444; to create the in trans tag. The stability of the plasmids encoding egfp and mCherry were confirmed in vitro for seven days of bacterial growth, and then, the A. brasilense strains harboring the plasmids were studied under nonselective conditions for adherence to seeds and, at seven or 14 days post-inoculation, for wheat root colonization. The utility of the labeled strains was proven by observation, using fluorescence microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in wheat plants inoculated with the labeled strains and compared with the CFU g -1 for seed and wheat root. The method was suitable for observation of the in situ formation of mini-colonies, enabled visualization of bacterial colonization sites on large root fragments, and showed adherence to germinated seeds and root colonization of all strains by cell counts and direct microscopic examination. Thus, we are able to quantify the structures of the biofilms formed by each strain."

"30906308","abstracttext","The complex quantitative nature of drought-related traits is a major constraint to breed tolerant wheat varieties. Pairs of near-isogenic lines (NILs) with a common genetic background but differing in a particular locus could turn quantitative traits into a Mendelian factor facilitating our understanding of genotype and phenotype interactions. In this study, we report our fast track development and evaluation of NILs from C306 × Dharwar Dry targeting a wheat 4BS QTL hotspot in C306, which confers drought tolerance following the heterogeneous inbreed family (HIF) analysis coupled with immature embryo culture-based fast generation technique. Molecular marker screening and phenotyping for grain yield and related traits under post-anthesis water stress (WS) confirmed four isoline pairs, viz., qDSI.4B.1-2, qDSI.4B.1-3, qDSI.4B.1-6, and qDSI.4B.1-8. There were significant contrasts of responses between the NILs with C306 QTL (+NILs) and the NILs without C306 QTL (-NILs). Among the four confirmed NIL pairs, mean grain yield per plant of the +NILs and -NILs showed significant differences ranging from 9.61 to 10.81 and 6.30 to 7.56 g, respectively, under WS condition, whereas a similar grain yield was recorded between the +NILs and -NILs under well-watered condition. Isolines of +NIL and -NIL pairs showed similar chlorophyll content (SPAD), assimilation rate (A), and transpiration rate (Tr) at the beginning of the stress. However, the +NILs showed significantly higher SPAD (12%), A (66%), stomatal conductance (75%), and Tr (97%) than the -NILs at the seventh day of stress. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis targeting the MYB transcription factor gene Triticum aestivum MYB 82 ( TaMYB 82), within this genomic region which was retrieved from the wheat reference genome TGACv1, also revealed differential expression in +NILs and -NILs under stress. These results confirmed that the NILs can be invaluable resources for fine mapping of this QTL, and also for cloning and functional characterization of the gene(s) responsible for drought tolerance in wheat."

"30679453","abstracttext","Leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina is one of the main diseases affecting wheat (Triticum aestivum) production worldwide. Calmodulin (CaM) was found involved in the early stage of signal transduction pathway in response to P. triticina in wheat. To study the function and molecular mechanism of calmodulin (CaM) in signal transduction of wheat against P. triticina, we cloned a putative calmodulin-binding transcription activator (TaCAMTA4), and characterized its molecular structure and functions by using the CaM-encoding gene (TaCaM4-1) as a bait to screen the cDNA library from P. triticina infected wheat leaves. The open reading frame of TaCAMTA4 was 2505 bp encoding a protein of 834 aa, which contained all the four conserved domains of family (CG-1 domain, TIG domain, ANK repeats and CaM-binding domain). TaCaM4-1 bound to TaCAMTA4 by the C-terminal CaM-binding domain in Ca 2+ -dependent manner in the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis indicated that the interaction of TaCAMTA4 and TaCaM4-1 took place in the cytoplasm and nucleus of epidermal leaf cells in N. benthamiana. The expression level of TaCAMTA4 genes was down-regulated in incompatible combination after P. triticina infection. Furthermore, virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS)-based knockdown of TaCAMTA4 and disease assays verified that silencing of TaCAMTA4 resulted in enhanced resistance to P. triticina race 165. These results suggested that TaCAMTA4 function as negative regulator of defense response against P. triticina."

"30717398","abstracttext","Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is involved in many developmental processes and responses to various abiotic stresses in plants. Most of the studies on melatonin focus on its functions and physiological responses in plants, while its regulation mechanism remains unknown. Caffeic acid 3-O-methyltransferase (COMT) functions at a key step of the biosynthesis process of melatonin. In this study, a COMT-like gene, TaCOMT (Traes_1AL_D9035D5E0.1) was identified in common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Transient transformation in wheat protoplasts determined that TaCOMT is localized in cytoplasm. TaCOMT in wheat was induced by drought stress, gibberellin (GA)3 and 3-Indoleacetic acid (IAA), but not by ABA. In TaCOMT transgenic Arabidopsis , melatonin contents were higher than that in wild type (WT) plants. Under D-Mannitol treatment, the fresh weight of the transgenic Arabidopsis was significantly higher than WT, and transgenic lines had a stronger root system compared to WT. Drought tolerance assays in pots showed that the survival rate of TaCOMT -overexpression lines was significantly higher than that of WT lines. this phenotype was similar to that the WT lines treated with melatonin under drought condition. In addition, the TaCOMT transgenic lines had higher proline content and lower malondialdehyde (MDA) content compared to WT lines after drought treatment. These results indicated that overexpression of the wheat TaCOMT gene enhances drought tolerance and increases the content of melatonin in transgenic Arabidopsis . It could be one of the potential genes for agricultural applications."

"31168755","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an allohexaploid, and the transcriptional characteristics of the wheat embryo and endosperm during grain development remain unclear. To analyze the transcriptome, we performed isoform sequencing (Iso-Seq) for wheat grain and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) for the embryo and de-embryonated kernels. The differential regulation between the embryo and de-embryonated kernels was found to be greater than the difference between the two time points for each tissue. Exactly 2264 and 4790 tissue-specific genes were found at 14 days post-anthesis (DPA), while 5166 and 3784 genes were found at 25 DPA in the embryo and de-embryonated kernels, respectively. Genes expressed in the embryo were more likely to be related to nucleic acid and enzyme regulation. In de-embryonated kernels, genes were rich in substance metabolism and enzyme activity functions. Moreover, 4351, 4641, 4516, and 4453 genes with the A, B, and D homoeoloci were detected for each of the four tissues. Expression characteristics suggested that the D genome may be the largest contributor to the transcriptome in developing grain. Among these, 48, 66, and 38 silenced genes emerged in the A, B, and D genomes, respectively. Gene ontology analysis showed that silenced genes could be inclined to different functions in different genomes. Our study provided specific gene pools of the embryo and de-embryonated kernels and a homoeolog expression bias model on a large scale. This is helpful for providing new insights into the molecular physiology of wheat."
"31189658","articletitle","A Conserved Sequence from Heat-Adapted Species Improves Rubisco Activase Thermostability in Wheat."
"31189658","abstracttext","The central enzyme of photosynthesis, Rubisco, is regulated by Rubisco activase (Rca). Photosynthesis is impaired during heat stress, and this limitation is often attributed to the heat-labile nature of Rca. We characterized gene expression and protein thermostability for the three Rca isoforms present in wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), namely TaRca1-β, TaRca2-α, and TaRca2-β. Furthermore, we compared wheat Rca with one of the two Rca isoforms from rice ( Oryza sativa ; OsRca-β) and Rca from other species adapted to warm environments. The TaRca1 gene was induced, whereas TaRca2 was suppressed by heat stress. The TaRca2 isoforms were sensitive to heat degradation, with thermal midpoints of 35°C ± 0.3°C, the temperature at which Rubisco activation velocity by Rca was halved. By contrast, TaRca1-β was more thermotolerant, with a thermal midpoint of 42°C, matching that of rice OsRca-β. Mutations of the TaRca2-β isoform based on sequence alignment of the thermostable TaRca1-β from wheat, OsRca-β from rice, and a consensus sequence representing Rca from warm-adapted species enabled the identification of 11 amino acid substitutions that improved its thermostability by greater than 7°C without a reduction in catalytic velocity at a standard 25°C. Protein structure modeling and mutational analysis suggested that the thermostability of these mutational variants arises from monomeric and not oligomeric thermal stabilization. These results provide a mechanism for improving the heat stress tolerance of photosynthesis in wheat and potentially other species, which is a desirable outcome considering the likelihood that crops will face more frequent heat stress conditions over the coming decades."

"33016591","abstracttext_core ideas","First genome-wide association mapping of adult plant Septoria nodorum blotch resistance. Some adult plant resistance loci were shared with seedling resistance loci. Other adult plant resistance loci were significant across environments. Resistant haplotypes were identified, which can be used for breeding. Parastagonospora nodorum is the causal agent of Septoria nodorum leaf blotch (SNB) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). It is the most important leaf blotch pathogen in Norwegian spring wheat. Several quantitative trait loci (QTL) for SNB susceptibility have been identified. Some of these QTL are the result of underlying gene-for-gene interactions involving necrotrophic effectors (NEs) and corresponding sensitivity (Snn) genes. A collection of diverse spring wheat lines was evaluated for SNB resistance and susceptibility over seven growing seasons in the field. In addition, wheat seedlings were inoculated and infiltrated with culture filtrates (CFs) from four single spore isolates and infiltrated with semipurified NEs (SnToxA, SnTox1, and SnTox3) under greenhouse conditions. In adult plants, the most stable SNB resistance QTL were located on chromosomes 2B, 2D, 4A, 4B, 5A, 6B, 7A, and 7B. The QTL on chromosome 2D was effective most years in the field. At the seedling stage, the most significant QTL after inoculation were located on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 3A, 4B, 5B, 6B, 7A, and 7B. The QTL on chromosomes 3A and 6B were significant both after inoculation and CF infiltration, indicating the presence of novel NE-Snn interactions. The QTL on chromosomes 4B and 7A were significant in both seedlings and adult plants. Correlations between SnToxA sensitivity and disease severity in the field were significant. To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide association mapping study (GWAS) to investigate SNB resistance at the adult plant stage under field conditions."

"33101350","abstracttext","AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) proteins regulate a wide range of signaling pathways, from general plant growth to abiotic stress responses. Here, we performed a genome-wide survey in wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and identified 69 TaARF members that formed 24 homoeologous groups. Phylogenetic analysis clustered TaARF genes into three clades, similar to ARF genes in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) and rice ( Oryza sativa ). Structural characterization suggested that ARF gene structure and domain composition are well conserved between plant species. Expression profiling revealed diverse patterns of TaARF transcript levels across a range of developmental stages, tissues, and abiotic stresses. A number of TaARF genes shared similar expression patterns and were preferentially expressed in anthers. Moreover, our systematic analysis identiﬁed three anther-specific TaARF genes ( TaARF8 , TaARF9 , and TaARF21 ) whose expression was signiﬁcantly altered by low temperature in thermosensitive genic male-sterile (TGMS) wheat; these TaARF genes are candidates to participate in the cold-induced male sterility pathway, and offer potential applications in TGMS wheat breeding and hybrid seed production. Moreover, we identified putative functions for a set of TaARFs involved in responses to abscisic acid and abiotic stress. Overall, this study characterized the wheat ARF gene family and generated several hypotheses for future investigation of ARF function during anther development and abiotic stress."
"33218636","articletitle","Expression interference of a number of Heterodera avenae conserved genes perturbs nematode parasitic success in Triticum aestivum."
"33218636","abstracttext","The cereal cyst nematode, Heterodera avenae is distributed worldwide and causes substantial damage in bread wheat, Triticum aestivum. This nematode is extremely difficult to manage because of its prolonged persistence as unhatched eggs encased in cysts. Due to its sustainable and target-specific nature, RNA interference (RNAi)-based strategy has gained unprecedented importance for pest control. To date, RNAi strategy has not been exploited to manage H. avenae in wheat. In the present study, 40 H. avenae target genes with different molecular function were rationally selected for in vitro soaking analysis in order to assess their susceptibility to RNAi. In contrast to target-specific downregulation of 18 genes, 7 genes were upregulated and 15 genes showed unaltered expression (although combinatorial soaking showed some of these genes are RNAi susceptible), suggesting that a few of the target genes were refractory or recalcitrant to RNAi. However, RNAi of 37 of these genes negatively altered nematode behavior in terms of reduced penetration, development and reproduction in wheat. Subsequently, wheat plants were transformed with seven H. avenae target genes (that showed greatest abrogation of nematode parasitic success) for host-induced gene silencing (HIGS) analysis. Transformed plants were molecularly characterized by PCR, RT-qPCR and Southern hybridization. Production of target gene-specific double- and single-stranded RNA (dsRNA/siRNA) was detected in transformed plants. Transgenic expression of galectin, cathepsin L, vap1, serpin, flp12, RanBPM and chitinase genes conferred 33.24-72.4 % reduction in H. avenae multiplication in T 1 events with single copy ones exhibiting greatest reduction. A similar degree of resistance observed in T 2 plants indicated the consistent HIGS effect in the subsequent generations. Intriguingly, cysts isolated from RNAi plants were of smaller size with translucent cuticle compared to normal size, dark brown control cysts, suggesting H. avenae developmental retardation due to HIGS. Our study reinforces the potential of HIGS to manage nematode problems in crop plant."

"17874224","abstracttext","ERF transcription factors play important roles in regulating gene expression under abiotic and biotic stresses. The first member of the ERF gene family in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was isolated by screening a drought-induced cDNA library and designated as T. aestivum ethylene-responsive factor 1 (TaERF1), which encoded a putative protein of 355 amino acids with a conserved DNA-binding domain and a conserved N-terminal motif (MCGGAIL). The TaERF1 gene was located on chromosome 7A. Protein interaction assays indicated that TaERF1, with a putative phosphorylation site (TPDITS) in the C-terminal region, was a potential phosphorylation substrate for TaMAPK1 protein kinase. Deletion of the N-terminal motif enhanced the interaction of TaERF1 with TaMAPK1. The predicted TaERF1 protein contained three putative nuclear localization signals (NLSs), and three NLSs modulated synergistically the activity of subcellular localization. As a trans-acting factor, TaERF1 was capable of binding to the GCC-box and CRT/DRE elements in vitro, and of trans-activating reporter gene expression in tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) leaves. Transcription of the TaERF1 gene was induced not only by drought, salinity and low-temperature stresses and exogenous ABA, ethylene and salicylic acid, but also by infection with Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici. Furthermore, overexpression of TaERF1 activated stress-related genes, including PR and COR/RD genes, under normal growth conditions, and improved pathogen and abiotic stress tolerance in transgenic plants. These results suggested that the TaERF1 gene encodes a GCC-box and CRT/DRE element binding factor that might be involved in multiple stress signal transduction pathways."

However molecular relationships based on genomic sequence comparison, including both coding and non-coding DNA, have never been investigated. In an attempt to clarify these relationships, we compared, in this study, sequences of the Storage Protein Activator (SPA) locus region of the S genome of Ae. speltoides (2n = 14) to that of the A, B and D genomes co-resident in the hexaploid wheat species (Triticum aestivum, AABBDD, 2n = 42)."
"19032732","abstracttext_results","Four BAC clones, spanning the SPA locus of respectively the A, B, D and S genomes, were isolated and sequenced. Orthologous genomic regions were identified as delimited by shared non-transposable elements and non-coding sequences surrounding the SPA gene and correspond to 35,268, 22,739, 43,397 and 53,919 bp for the A, B, D and S genomes, respectively. Sequence length discrepancies within and outside the SPA orthologous regions are the result of non-shared transposable elements (TE) insertions, all of which inserted after the progenitors of the four genomes divergence."
"19032732","abstracttext_conclusion","On the basis of conserved sequence length as well as identity of the shared non-TE regions and the SPA coding sequence, Ae speltoides appears to be more evolutionary related to the B genome of T. aestivum than the A and D genomes. However, the differential insertions of TEs, none of which are conserved between the two genomes led to the conclusion that the S genome of Ae. speltoides has diverged very early from the progenitor of the B genome which remains to be identified."

The objectives of this study were to map a stripe rust resistance gene in Chinese wheat cultivar Chuanmai 42 using molecular markers and to investigate its allelism with Yr24 and Yr26. A total of 787 F2 plants and 186 F3 lines derived from a cross between resistant cultivar Chuanmai 42 and susceptible line Taichung 29 were used for resistance gene tagging. Also 197 F2 plants from the cross Chuanmai 42xYr24/3*Avocet S and 726 F2 plants from Chuanmai 42xYr26/3*Avocet S were employed for allelic test of the resistance genes. In all, 819 pairs of wheat SSR primers were used to test the two parents, as well as resistant and susceptible bulks. Subsequently, nine polymorphic markers were employed for genotyping the F2 and F3 populations. Results indicated that the stripe rust resistance in Chuanmai 42 was conferred by a single dominant gene, temporarily designated YrCH42, located close to the centromere of chromosome 1B and flanked by nine SSR markers Xwmc626, Xgwm273, Xgwm11, Xgwm18, Xbarc137, Xbarc187, Xgwm498, Xbarc240 and Xwmc216. The resistance gene was closely linked to Xgwm498 and Xbarc187 with genetic distances of 1.6 and 2.3 cM, respectively. The seedling tests with 26 PST isolates and allelic tests indicated that YrCH42, Yr24 and Yr26 are likely to be the same gene."

"19347606","abstracttext","Two genotypes showing differential immunity against Karnal bunt (Tilletia indica) were used to investigate the role of three members of cystatin gene family in growth stage dependent immunity in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Three members of cystatin gene family (WC1, WC2, and WC4) were cloned and sequenced. Analysis of sequenced data showed that there was 76-99% nucleotide and protein sequence identity between different genes of the wheat cystatin. In silico amino acid sequence analysis revealed the presence of a conserved signature pattern of residues and also the functional domains were presumed to be actively involved in imparting cysteine protease inhibition capability. The semi-quantitative and quantitative levels of these members were measured by means of RT-PCR, northern blotting, western blotting, and by ELISA techniques. The members of cystatin gene family were expressed in both resistant (HD 29) and susceptible genotypes (WH 542); however, the expression level was significantly (P < 0.001) higher in resistant compared to susceptible genotype at all the stages of wheat spikes. The patterns of expression of WC2, WC4 were similar except in the levels in S(1) and S(2) stages as it remained constant (P > 0.05) in contrary to WC1 family whose expression gradually increased from S(v) to S(2) stage. According to the intensity of the detected band in RT PCR, northern blot and western blot, WC1 family seems to be expressed more than the other gene families. The immunoassay results further showed that WC1 protein was abundantly expressed in resistant genotype and high expression was observed at the S2 stage as compared to susceptible genotype (P < 0.001) suggesting that low level of expression of WC1 in S2 stage is responsible for KB infection. The results of the present study clearly indicate the role of cystatin gene family in differential and stage dependent immunity against KB."

"24709151","abstracttext","We examined the role of pathogenesis-related protein TaBWPR-1.2 in the context of molecular and physiological responses of wheat (Triticum aestivum) seminal roots under waterlogging stress. Two cDNAs corresponding to the TaBWPR-1.2 gene, TaBWPR-1.2#2 and TaBWPR-1.2#13 were cloned from seminal roots. These cDNAs were predicted to encode proteins of 173 and 172 amino acids, respectively. In a time-course experiment, TaBWPR-1.2 gene expression was highest in whole seminal roots after 1 day of waterlogging treatment and higher than the control for at least 10 days; significantly increased protein abundance was observed after 7 days of waterlogging. Drought, another abiotic stress, did not influence TaBWPR-1.2 gene expression in wheat seminal roots at 5-d-old seedlings. Tissue-specific studies revealed that the highest TaBWPR-1.2 gene expression and protein levels were in the aerenchymatous root zone. TaBWPR-1.2 expression in seminal roots was also increased by the signalling molecules 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC; an ethylene precursor), H2O2, jasmonic acid (JA), and nitric oxide (NO); however, treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), salicylic acid (SA), and ethanol did not alter its expression. Interestingly, aerenchyma formation in the seminal root cortex was induced only by ACC and H2O2. Taken together, these results indicate that TaBWPR-1.2 is a waterlogging-responsive gene that might be associated with root cortex tissue alteration in wheat plants through ACC and/or H2O2 regulatory mechanisms."
"26399767","articletitle","Comparison of genome-wide gene expression patterns in the seedlings of nascent allohexaploid wheats produced by two combinations of hybrids."
"26399767","abstracttext","Allopolyploidization in plants is an important event that enhances heterosis and environmental adaptation. Common wheat, Triticum aestivum (AABBDD), which is an allohexaploid that evolved from an allopolyploidization event between T. turgidum (AABB) and Aegilops tauschii (DD), shows more growth vigor and wider adaptation than tetraploid wheats. To better understand the molecular basis for the heterosis of hexaploid wheat, we systematically analyzed the genome-wide gene expression patterns of two combinations of newly hybridized triploids (ABD), their chromosome-doubled hexaploids (AABBDD), stable synthetic hexaploids (AABBDD) and natural hexaploids, in addition to their parents, T. turgidum (AABB) and Ae. tauschii (DD), using a microarray to reconstruct the events of allopolyploidization and genome stabilization. Overall comparisons of gene expression profiles showed that the newly generated hexaploids exhibited gene expression patterns similar to those of their maternal tetraploids, irrespective of hybrid combination. With successive generations, the gene expression profiles of nascent hexaploids became less similar to the maternal profiles, and belonged to a separate cluster from the natural hexaploids. Triploids revealed characteristic expression patterns, suggesting endosperm effects. In the newly hybridized triploids (ABD) of two independent synthetic lines, approximately one-fifth of expressed genes displayed non-additive expression; the number of these genes decreased with polyploidization and genome stabilization. Approximately 20% of the non-additively expressed genes were transmitted across generations throughout allopolyploidization and successive self-pollinations, and 43 genes overlapped between the two combinations, indicating that shared gene expression patterns can be seen during allohexaploidization. Furthermore, four of these 43 genes were involved in starch and sucrose metabolism, suggesting that these metabolic events play key roles in the hybrid vigor of hexaploid wheat."

"28520950","abstracttext","Mayetiola destructor (Say) is a serious pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., in North America, North Africa, and Central Asia. Singly deployed resistance genes in wheat cultivars have provided effective management of Hessian fly populations for >50 yr. Thirty-five H genes have been documented. Defense mediated by the H gene constitutes strong selection on the Hessian fly population, killing 100% of larvae. A mutation in a matching Hessian fly avirulence gene confers virulence to the H gene, leading to survival on the resistant plant. As the frequency of virulence rises in the population, the H gene loses its effectiveness for pest management. Knowing the frequency of virulence in the population is not only important for monitoring but also for decisions about which H gene should be deployed in regional wheat breeding programs. Here, we present a novel assay for detecting virulence in the field. Hessian fly males were collected in Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina using sticky traps baited with Hessian fly sex pheromone. Utilizing two PCR reactions, diagnostic molecular markers for the six alleles controlling avirulence and virulence to H13 can be scored based on band size. Throughout the southeast, all three avirulence and three virulence alleles can be identified. In South Carolina, the PCR assay was sensitive enough to detect the spread of virulence into two counties previously documented as 100% susceptible to H13. The new assay also indicates that the previous methods overestimated virulence in the field owing to scoring of the plant instead of the insect."
"30812660","articletitle","A Computer Program to Improve the Efficiency and Accuracy of Postulating Race-Specific Resistance Genes."
"30812660","abstracttext","Gene postulation has been the most widely used technique to determine the presence of particular rust resistance genes in lines of small grains. It applies the principles of gene-for-gene specificity to determine the most probable race-specific resistance genes present in host lines. As the numbers of lines, resistance genes, and races increase, postulation based on visual comparisons of infection types becomes more complex and laborious, and errors may occur. A computer program was developed to facilitate identification of race-specific leaf rust (Lr) genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum). Seedlings of 116 contemporary lines of soft red winter wheat and 24 Thatcher isolines (each Thatcher isoline with a single Lr gene) were inoculated with 22 races of Puccinia triticina. Infection types were recorded on the standard 0 to 4 scale where infection types 3 and 4 were considered high (line was susceptible; race was virulent) and others were low (line was resistant; race was avirulent). Based on the gene-for-gene concept, lines susceptible to a particular race cannot have an Lr gene for which the race is avirulent. For each line, step 1 of the program summarized results from races that were virulent on the line to definitively exclude Lr genes from the line, and this exclusion resulted in a relatively short list of Lr genes that could be present. Step 2 of the program utilized data from races that were avirulent on the line, and the output listed the low infection types produced on the line and the isolines with Lr genes that were not excluded in step 1. Of these Lr genes, a gene was considered present if the low infection type produced on the line by one or more races matched the low infection type on the corresponding isoline. Otherwise, the gene was considered possibly present. Epistatic effects of one or more Lr genes prevented definitive inclusion or exclusion of genes considered possibly present. If the low infection type produced on the line was lower than that on any of the isolines listed in step 2, then the line was considered to have an unidentified Lr gene; i.e., a gene that was not in the set of 24 isolines. This program facilitated the objective and accurate postulation of Lr genes and could be adapted to other host-pathogen systems."
"31494998","articletitle","APETALA 2-like genes AP2L2 and Q specify lemma identity and axillary floral meristem development in wheat."
"31494998","abstracttext","The spikelet is the basic unit of the grass inflorescence. In tetraploid (Triticum turgidum) and hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum), the spikelet is a short indeterminate branch with two proximal sterile bracts (glumes) followed by a variable number of florets, each including a bract (lemma) with an axillary flower. Varying levels of miR172 and/or its target gene Q (AP2L5) result in gradual transitions of glumes to lemmas, and vice versa. Here, we show that AP2L5 and its related paralog AP2L2 play critical and redundant roles in the specification of axillary floral meristems and lemma identity. AP2L2, also targeted by miR172, displayed similar expression profiles to AP2L5 during spikelet development. Loss-of-function mutants in both homeologs of AP2L2 (henceforth ap2l2) developed normal spikelets, but ap2l2 ap2l5 double mutants generated spikelets with multiple empty bracts before transitioning to florets. The coordinated nature of these changes suggest an early role of these genes in floret development. Moreover, the flowers of ap2l2 ap2l5 mutants showed organ defects in paleas and lodicules, including the homeotic conversion of lodicules into carpels. Mutations in the miR172 target site of AP2L2 were associated with reduced plant height, more compact spikes, promotion of lemma-like characters in glumes and smaller lodicules. Taken together, our results show that the balance in the expression of miR172 and AP2-like genes is crucial for the correct development of spikelets and florets, and that this balance has been altered during the process of wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare) domestication. The manipulation of this regulatory module provides an opportunity to modify spikelet architecture and improve grain yield."

"23850729","abstracttext","In this study, ten glutenin gene promoters were isolated from model wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chinese Spring) using a genomic PCR strategy with gene-specific primers. Six belonged to high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) gene promoters, and four to low-molecular-weight glutenin subunit (LMW-GS). Sequence lengths varied from 1361 to 2,554 bp. We show that the glutenin gene promoter motifs are conserved in diverse sequences in this study, with HMW-GS and LMW-GS gene promoters characterized by distinct conserved motif combinations. Our findings show that HMW-GS promoters contain more functional motifs in the distal region of the glutenin gene promoter (> -700 bp) compared with LMW-GS. The y-type HMW-GS gene promoters possess unique motifs including RY repeat and as-2 box compared to the x-type. We also identified important motifs in the distal region of HMW-GS gene promoters including the 5'-UTR Py-rich stretch motif and the as-2 box motif. We found that cis-acting elements in the distal region of promoter 1Bx7 enhanced the expression of HMW-GS gene 1Bx7. Taken together, these data support efforts in designing molecular breeding strategies aiming to improve wheat quality. Our results offer insight into the regulatory mechanisms of glutenin gene expression."

"30634903","abstracttext_background","Trichoderma species, a class of plant beneficial fungi, may provide opportunistic symbionts to induce plant tolerance to abiotic stresses. Here, we determined the possible mechanisms responsible for the indole acetic acid (IAA) and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate-deaminase (ACC-deaminase) producing strain of Trichoderma longibrachiatum T6 (TL-6) in promoting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) growth and enhancing plant tolerance to NaCl stress."
"30634903","abstracttext_results","Wheat treated with or without TL-6 was grown under different levels of salt stress in controlled environmental conditions. TL-6 showed a high level of tolerance to 10 mg ml - 1 of NaCl stress and the inhibitory effect was more pronounced at higher NaCl concentrations. Under NaCl stress, the activity of ACC-deaminase and IAA concentration in TL-6 were promoted, with the activity of ACC-deaminase increased by 26% at the salt concentration of 10 mg ml - 1 and 31% at 20 mg ml - 1 , compared with non-saline stress; and the concentration of IAA was increased by 10 and 7%, respectively (P < 0.05). The increased ACC-deaminase and IAA concentration in the TL-6 strain may serve as an important signal to alleviate the negative effect of NaCl stress on wheat growth. As such, wheat seedlings with the ACC-deaminase and IAA producing strain of TL-6 treatment under NaCl stress increased the IAA concentration by an average of 11%, decreased the activity of ACC oxidase (ACO) by an average of 12% and ACC synthase (ACS) 13%, and decreased the level of ethylene synthesis and the content of ACC by 12 and 22%, respectively (P < 0.05). The TL-6 treatment decreased the transcriptional level of ethylene synthesis genes expression, and increased the IAA production genes expression significantly in wheat seedlings roots; down-regulated the expression of ACO genes by an average of 9% and ACS genes 12%, whereas up-regulated the expression of IAA genes by 10% (P < 0.05). TL-6 treatments under NaCl stress decreased the level of Na + accumulation; and increased the uptake of K + and the ratio of K + /Na + , and the transcriptional level of Na + /H + antiporter gene expression in both shoots and roots."
"30634903","abstracttext_conclusions","Our results indicate that the strain of TL-6 effectively promoted wheat growth and enhanced plant tolerance to NaCl stress through the increased ACC-deaminase activity and IAA production in TL-6 stain that modulate the IAA and ethylene synthesis, and regulate the transcriptional levels of IAA and ethylene synthesis genes expression in wheat seedling roots under salt stress, and minimize ionic toxicity by disturbing the intracellular ionic homeostasis in the plant cells. These biochemical, physiological and molecular responses helped promote the wheat seedling growth and enhanced plant tolerance to salt stress."
"15383067","articletitle","Characterization of the common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) mutation line producing three pistils in a floret."
"15383067","abstracttext","In a normal wheat (Triticum ssp.L.) spike, one floret carries only one pistil that will further develop into one grain after fertilization. The cultivated common wheat (T. aestivum L.) mutation line Three Pistils (TP) carried three pistils in a floret. Although one or two of the pistils died out before seed set in some florets, there were exist many florets that set three seeds. Normally, it was observed that there were one to three seeds in different florets of the same spike. Therefore, this mutation trait could raise considerably the number of grains per spike. The weight of 100 grains in three seeds set florets was lower than that of in one seed set florets. But three seeds set florets were significantly to surpass the one seed set florets in grain(s) weight per floret. Based on these results, the three pistils trait was suggested to be an interesting germplasm resource. Localisation of the gene controlling the three pistils trait was carried out by the method of crossing TP with the Chinese Spring disomic substitutions. F2 population segregation analysis revealed that only the 5B F2 population did not show homogeneity to control population. chi2-test analysis indicated that 5B F2 population, and only this population, was deviated from the Mendelian segregation ratio (3:1). As a conclusion, the gene for three pistils trait was located on chromosome 5B. According to the Recommended rules for gene symbolization in wheat, the name of the dominant gene for three pistils trait in the line TP was suggested as Pis1."

The Ph1 locus restricts chromosome pairing and recombination at meiosis to true homologues. The importance of wheat as a crop and the need to exploit its wild relatives as donors for economically important traits in wheat breeding programmes is the main drive to uncover the mechanism of the Ph1 locus and regulate its activity."
"17951583","abstracttext_methods","Following the molecular genetic characterization of the Ph1 locus, five additional deletion mutants covering the region have been identified. In addition, more bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) were sequenced and analysed to elucidate the complexity of this locus. A semi-quantitative RT-PCR was used to compare the expression profiles of different genes in the 5B region containing the Ph1 locus with their homoeologues on 5A and 5D. PCR products were cloned and sequenced to identify the gene from which they were derived."
"17951583","abstracttext_key results","Deletion mutants and expression profiling of genes in the region containing the Ph1 locus on 5B has further restricted Ph1 to a cluster of cdk-like genes. Bioinformatic analysis of the cdk-like genes revealed their close homology to the checkpoint kinase Cdk2 from humans. Cdk2 is involved in the initiation of replication and is required in early meiosis. Expression profiling has revealed that the cdk-like gene cluster is unique within the region analysed on 5B in that these genes are transcribed. Deletion of the cdk-like locus on 5B results in activation of transcription of functional cdk-like copies on 5A and 5D. Thus the cdk locus on 5B is dominant to those on 5A and 5D in determining the overall activity, which will be dependent on a complex interplay between transcription from non-functional and functional cdk-like genes."

"20552325","abstracttext","Adult plant resistance (APR) to leaf rust and stripe rust derived from the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) line PI250413 was previously identified in RL6077 (=Thatcher*6/PI250413). The leaf rust resistance gene in RL6077 is phenotypically similar to Lr34 which is located on chromosome 7D. It was previously hypothesized that the gene in RL6077 could be Lr34 translocated to another chromosome. Hybrids between RL6077 and Thatcher and between RL6077 and 7DS and 7DL ditelocentric stocks were examined for first meiotic metaphase pairing. RL6077 formed chain quadrivalents and trivalents relative to Thatcher and Chinese Spring; however both 7D telocentrics paired only as heteromorphic bivalents and never with the multivalents. Thus, chromosome 7D is not involved in any translocation carried by RL6077. A genome-wide scan of SSR markers detected an introgression from chromosome 4D of PI250413 transferred to RL6077 through five cycles of backcrossing to Thatcher. Haplotype analysis of lines from crosses of Thatcher × RL6077 and RL6058 (Thatcher*6/PI58548) × RL6077 showed highly significant associations between introgressed markers (including SSR marker cfd71) and leaf rust resistance. In a separate RL6077-derived population, APR to stripe rust was also tightly linked with cfd71 on chromosome 4DL. An allele survey of linked SSR markers cfd71 and cfd23 on a set of 247 wheat lines from diverse origins indicated that these markers can be used to select for the donor segment in most wheat backgrounds. Comparison of RL6077 with Thatcher in field trials showed no effect of the APR gene on important agronomic or quality traits. Since no other known Lr genes exist on chromosome 4DL, the APR gene in RL6077 has been assigned the name Lr67."

"19154231","abstracttext","A sulphate deficiency-induced gene, sdi1, has been identified by cDNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis utilizing field-grown, nutrient-deficient wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Hereward). The expression of sdi1 was specifically induced in leaf and root tissues in response to sulphate deficiency, but was not induced by nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium or magnesium deficiency. Expression was also shown to increase in plant tissues as the external sulphate concentration in hydroponically grown plants was reduced from 1.0 to 0.0 mm. On this basis, sdi1 gene expression has potential as a sensitive indicator of sulphur nutritional status in wheat. Genome-walking techniques were used to clone the 2.7-kb region upstream of sdi1 from genomic DNA, revealing several cis-element motifs previously identified as being associated with sulphur responses in plants. The Arabidopsis thaliana gene most highly homologous to sdi1 is At5g48850, which was also demonstrated to be induced by sulphur deficiency, an observation confirmed by the analysis of microarray data available in the public domain. The expression of Atsdi1 was induced more rapidly than previously characterized sulphur-responsive genes in the period immediately following the transfer of plants to sulphur-deficient medium. Atsdi1 T-DNA 'knockout' mutants were shown to maintain higher tissue sulphate concentrations than wild-type plants under sulphur-limiting conditions, indicating a role in the utilization of stored sulphate under sulphur-deficient conditions. The structural features of the sdi1 gene and its application in the genetic determination of the sulphur nutritional status of wheat crops are discussed."

"30812658","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum blotch can cause serious yield and quality losses of wheat (Triticum aestivum) in many countries worldwide. Although there are other control methods, host resistance is the most desirable. Three recent Kansas winter wheat cultivars (Betty, Heyne, and 2163) have been developed with moderate levels of resistance to the leaf phase of Stagonospora nodorum blotch. To determine inheritance of resistance and allelism, these cultivars were crossed with one of three susceptible lines (Larned, KS96WGRC39, or Newton) and intercrossed in all possible combinations, including reciprocals. The parents, F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 generations were tested for resistance to S. nodorum in the greenhouse as 4-week-old seedlings. Cytoplasmic effects were not detected in any cross. The mean levels of infection in the F 1 s of the two crosses Betty × Larned and Heyne × KS96WGRC39 indicated resistance was dominant. The observed phenotypic ratios of F 2 plants for both crosses were not significantly different from the expected ratio for a single dominant gene. The ratio observed for F 3 lines in the Betty × Larned cross fit that expected for a single dominant gene. However, the observed ratio of the F 3 lines from the cross Heyne × KS96WGRC39 did not fit the ratio expected for a single dominant gene. The allelism test for Betty and Heyne indicated that they have different resistance genes. The F 1 mean rating of the cross 2163 × Newton was intermediate between the two parents, indicating the absence of dominance for resistance in 2163. The phenotypic ratio observed in the F 2 plants from this cross did not fit the ratio expected for a single dominant gene. The simple genetic control of resistance in cv. Betty makes it a useful source of resistance for wheat breeding programs."

"7579156","abstracttext","The mitochondrial outer membrane of eukaryotic cells contains voltage-dependent anion channels (VDAC) also termed porins. Three cDNAs from wheat (Triticum aestivum) were isolated and sequenced (Tavdac 1-3). They share 65% similarity of their amino acid sequences, and therefore they probably represent isoforms. The deduced amino acid sequence of one of the cDNAs was found to be identical to the purified VDAC protein from wheat mitochondria [8]. Secondary structure analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the three vdac cDNAs revealed a characteristic alpha helix at their N-terminal and beta-barrel cylinders characteristic of VDAC channels. The Tavdac cDNAs are differentially expressed in meristematic tissues. The transcript levels of Tavdac 1 in all wheat tissues is at least 2.5-fold higher than Tavdac 2 and Tavdac 3. Tavdac 2 has a low level of expression in all floral tissues whereas Tavdac 3 is highly expressed in anthers. This is the first report on differential expression of vdac genes in plants. The Tavdac genes have been mapped on the wheat genome. Tavdac 1 is located on the long arm of chromosome 5, Tavdac 2 on the long arm of chromosome 1 and Tavdac 3 on the long arm of chromosome 3. A phylogenetic reconstruction indicates that vdac genes underwent numerous duplication events throughout their evolution. All duplications occurred after the separation of plants from animals and fungi, and no orthologous genes are shared among phyla. Within plants, some of the vdac gene duplications probably occurred before the monocotydelon-dicotydelon split."

"10846621","abstracttext","A cDNA library was constructed from a cold-acclimated winter-hardy common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar 'Mironovska 808'. Using this library and a cold- and light-responsive barley cDNA clone cor14b as a probe, cDNAs of a homologous wheat gene wcor14 were isolated. Two identical cDNAs designated as wcor14a had an open reading frame encoding an acidic (pI = 4.71) and hydrophobic polypeptide with 140 amino acids (MW = 13.5 kDa). The deduced WCOR14a polypeptide showed 70% identity with the barley chloroplast-imported COR14b and had a nearly identical N-terminal, putative chloroplast transit peptide of 51 amino acid residues. Another cDNA clone wcor14b was assumed to encode a polypeptide WCORb which had 5 substitutions and a frame shift in the C-terminal region as compared with WCOR14a. RACE PCR, genomic PCR and Southern blot analyses suggested that wcor14 and its related sequences constitute a small multigene family with and without an intron in the hexaploid wheat genome. Northern blot analysis showed that transcripts of wcor14 accumulated within 3-6 hours of cold acclimation at 4 degrees C and the level reached a maximum at day 3. The transcripts became non-detectable within 3 hours after de-acclimation at room temperature. Contrary to the barley cor14b, a similar level of wcor14 transcripts was detected under the continuous darkness. Neither treatment with NaCl, ABA nor dehydration induced its expression. Based on these results we conclude that wcor14 is a wheat orthologue of the barley cor14b and specifically induced by low temperature."

(Homoptera: Aphididae) after feeding on transgenic or nontransformed wheat, Triticum aestivum L., genotypes were studied. Three wheat genotypes were tested as virus sources: virus-susceptible 'Lambert' and 'Lambert'-derived transgenic lines 103.1J and 126.02, which express the BYDV-PAV coat protein gene. Lower virus titers were measured in BYDV-infected transgenic plants compared with Lambert. No significant differences in transmission efficiency were detected for R. padi after varying IAPs, regardless of genotype. Transmission efficiency increased with an increase in AAP in all genotypes tested. However, AAPs ranging from 6 to 48 h on Lambert resulted in significantly greater transmission efficiency than similar periods on transgenic 103.1J. Maximum transmission efficiency (70%) was observed after a 48-h AAP on Lambert, whereas the same AAP on 103.1J and 126.02 resulted in a significantly lower transmission efficiency (57%). Contrasts were used to compare the rates of transmission and the theoretical maximum transmission percentage among the different wheat genotypes serving as virus sources. Both parameters were significantly different among genotypes, indicating that viral acquisition from each genotype resulted in a unique pattern of virus transmission by R. padi. The lowest rate of virus transmission after an AAP was observed on 103.1J compared with 126.02 or Lambert. This is likely associated with a lower virus titer in 103.1J. This is the first report of transgenic virus resistance in wheat affecting the transmission efficiency of a virus vector."

"15841359","abstracttext","Analysis of genetic diversity changes in existing gene pools of cultivated crops is important for understanding the impact of plant breeding on crop genetic diversity and developing effective indicators for genetic diversity of cultivated plants. The objective of this study was to assess genetic diversity changes in 75 Canadian hard red wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars released from 1845 to 2004 using 31 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) markers. A total of 267 SSR alleles were detected, and their allelic frequencies ranged from 0.01 to 0.97, with an average of 0.14. Significant allelic reduction was observed at only four SSR loci for the cultivars released from 1970 onwards. However, 51 alleles (about 19%) present in pre-1910 cultivars were undetected in cultivars released after 1990 and were spread over 27 SSR loci. The proportion of SSR variation accounted for by six breeding periods was 12.5%, by four ancestral families, 16.5%, and by eight breeding programs, 8.4%. The average genetic diversity measured by three different band-sharing methods did not change significantly among cultivars released from different breeding periods, breeding programs, and ancestral families. However, genetic shift was obvious in the cultivars released over the six breeding periods, reflecting well the various breeding efforts over years. These results clearly show the allelic reduction and genetic shift in the Canadian hard red spring wheat germplasm released over time. Consequently, more effort needs to be made to broaden the wheat breeding base and conserve wheat germplasm."

"16893592","abstracttext","There is limited information on the impact of present-day ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on a reprogramming of gene expression in crops. Summer wheat was cultivated in controlled environmental facilities under simulated realistic climatic conditions. We investigated the effect of different regimes of UV-B radiation on summer wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars Nandu, Star and Turbo. Until recently, these were most important in Bavaria. Different cultivars of crops often show great differences in their sensitivity towards UV-B radiation. To identify genes that might be involved in UV-B defence mechanisms, we first analyzed selected genes known to be involved in plant defence mechanisms. RNA gel blot analysis of RNA isolated from the flag leaf of 84-day-old plants showed differences in transcript levels among the cultivars. Flag leaves are known to be important for grain development, which was completed at 84 days post-anthesis. Catalase 2 (Cat2) transcripts were elevated by increased UV irradiation in all cultivars with highest levels in cv. Nandu. Pathogenesis-related protein 1 (PR1) transcripts were elevated only in cv. Star. A minor influence on transcripts for phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) was observed in all three cultivars. This indicates different levels of acclimation to UV-B radiation in the wheat cultivars studied. To analyze these responses in more detail, UV-B-exposed flag leaves of 84-day-old wheat (cv. Nandu) were pooled to isolate cDNAs of induced genes by suppression-subtractive hybridization (SSH). Among the initially isolated cDNA clones, 13 were verified by RNA gel blot analysis showing an up-regulation at elevated levels of UV-B radiation. Functional classification revealed genes encoding proteins associated with protein assembly, chaperonins, programmed cell death and signal transduction. We also studied growth, flowering time, ear development and yield as more typical agricultural parameters. Plant growth of young plants was reduced at increased UV-B radiation. Flowering and ear development were delayed concomitantly, whereas total grain weight was not influenced at any of the UV-B irradiation regimes."

"19253666","abstracttext","Insect biotypes are populations able to kill or injure crops with resistance genes and complicate pest management programs based on host plant resistance. Biotypes occur in Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), a worldwide pest of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., and barley, Hordeum vulgare L., that was introduced into Mexico in 1980 and then spread into Texas by 1986. Five D. noxia biotypes were described in the United States and given the number designations 1 through 5. Of these, only Biotypes 1 and 2, which are nondamaging and damaging to Dn4-resistant wheat, respectively, are common and agriculturally important. Only a single clone of Biotypes 3, 4, and 5 were found in nature and now exist in the laboratory. The biotypes were found after 5 yr of the commercial planting of resistant wheat and their origin is unknown. To understand the genetic relatedness and origin of D. noxia biotypes in the United States, we used three molecular markers to assay for genetic variation within and between Biotypes 1 and 2, and for variation between Biotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. A single random amplified polymorphic DNA polymorphism was found in only two individuals. No DNA sequence variation in the cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial gene was found between 26 D. noxia clones. No variation was found at seven examined simple sequence repeat loci. Results suggest Biotype 2 originated from the extant population and does not represent a second introduction of a genetically divergent biotype."

"17160453","abstracttext","A burst of evolutionary duplication upon land colonization seems to have led to the large superfamily of cytochromes P450 in higher plants. Within this superfamily some clans and families are heavily duplicated. Others, such as genes involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway have led to fewer duplication events. Eight coding sequences belonging to the CYP98 family reported to catalyze the 3-hydroxylation step in this pathway were isolated from Triticum aestivum (wheat) and expressed in yeast. Comparison of the catalytic properties of the recombinant enzymes with those of CYP98s from other plant taxa was coupled to phylogenetic analyses. Our results indicate that the unusually high frequency of gene duplication in the wheat CYP98 family is a direct or indirect result from ploidization. While ancient duplication led to evolution of enzymes with different substrate preferences, most of recent duplicates underwent silencing via degenerative mutations. Three of the eight tested CYP98s from wheat have phenol meta-hydroxylase activity, with p-coumaroylshikimate being the primary substrate for all of these, as it is the case for CYP98s from sweet basil and Arabidopsis thaliana. However, CYP98s from divergent taxa have acquired different additional subsidiary activities. Some of them might be significant in the metabolism of various free or conjugated phenolics in different plant species. One of the most significant is meta-hydroxylation of p-coumaroyltyramine, predominantly by the wheat enzymes, for the synthesis of suberin phenolic monomers. Homology modeling, confirmed by directed mutagenesis, provides information on the protein regions and structural features important for some observed changes in substrate selectivity. They indicate that the metabolism of quinate ester and tyramine amide of p-coumaric acid rely on the same recognition site in the protein."

The 101 F(8) RILs were evaluated with 250 resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP), 245 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 1 sequence tagged site (STS) markers for genetic linkage map construction. Two QTL, which explained 48-61% of the total phenotypic variation of the HTAP resistance in Stephens, were identified. QYrst.wgp-6BS.1 was within a 3.9-cM region flanked by Xbarc101 and Xbarc136. QYrst.wgp-6BS.2 was mapped in a 17.5-cM region flanked by Xgwm132 and Xgdm113. Both two QTL were physically mapped to the short arm of chromosome 6B, but in different bins. Validation and polymorphism tests of the flanking markers in 43 wheat genotypes indicated that the molecular markers associated with these QTL should be useful in marker-assisted breeding programs to efficiently incorporate HTAP resistance into new wheat cultivars."

"17646706","abstracttext","The mature wheat embryo is arguably one of the best explants for genetic transformation because of its unlimited availability and lack of growth season restriction. However, an efficient regeneration system using mature wheat embryos (Triticum aestivum L.) is still not available. To identify genes related to the tissue culture response (TCR) of wheat, QTLs for callus induction from mature embryos and callus regeneration were mapped using an RIL population derived from the cross of ""Wangshuibai"" with ""Nanda2419"" which has a good TCR. By whole genome scanning we identified five, four and four chromosome regions conditioning, respectively, percent embryos forming a callus (PEFC), percent calli regenerating plantlets (PCRP), and number of plantlets per regenerating callus (NPRC). The major QTLs QPefc.nau-2A and QPcrp.nau-2A were mapped to the long arm of chromosome 2A, explaining up to 22.8% and 17.6% of the respective phenotypic variance. Moreover, two major QTLs for NPRC were detected on chromosomes 2D and 5D; these together explained 51.6% of the phenotypic variance. We found that chromosomes 2A, 2D, 5A, 5B and 5D were associated via different intervals with at least two of the three TCR indexes used. Based on this study and other reports, the TCRs of different explant types of wheat may be under the control of shared or tightly linked genes, while different genes or gene combinations may govern the stages from callus induction to plantlet regeneration. The importance of group 2 and 5 chromosomes in controlling the TCRs of Triticeae crops and the likely conservation of the corresponding genes in cereals are discussed."

"22672716","abstracttext","Wheat is a critical food source globally. Food security is an increasing concern; current production levels are not expected to keep pace with global demand. New technologies have provided a vast array of wheat genetic data; however, best use of this data requires placing it within a framework in which the various genes, pathways and interactions can be examined. Here we present the first systematic comparison of the global transcriptomes of the aleurone and starchy endosperm of the developing wheat seed (Triticum aestivum), at time points critical to the development of the aleurone layer; 6-, 9- and 14-day post-anthesis. Illumina sequencing gave 25-55 million sequence reads per tissue, of the trimmed reads, 70%-81% mapped to reference expressed sequence transcripts. Transcript abundance was analysed by performing RNA-Seq normalization to generate reads per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads values, and these were used in comparative analyses between the tissues at each time point using Kal's Z-test. This identified 9414-13 202 highly differentially expressed transcripts that were categorized on the basis of tissue and time point expression and functionally analysed revealing two very distinct tissues. The results demonstrate the fundamental biological reprogramming of the two major biologically and economically significant tissues of the wheat seed over this time course. Understanding these changes in gene expression profiles is essential to mining the potential these tissues hold for human nutrition and contributing to the systems biology of this important crop plant."
"23381806","articletitle","A non-additive interaction in a single locus causes a very short root phenotype in wheat."
"23381806","abstracttext","Non-additive allelic interactions underlie over dominant and under dominant inheritance, which explain positive and negative heterosis. These heteroses are often observed in the aboveground traits, but rarely reported in root. We identified a very short root (VSR) phenotype in the F1 hybrid between the common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) landrace Chinese Spring and synthetic wheat accession TA4152-71. When germinated in tap water, primary roots of the parental lines reached ~15 cm 10 days after germination, but those of the F1 hybrid were ~3 cm long. Selfing populations segregated at a 1 (long-root) to 1 (short-root) ratio, indicating that VSR is controlled by a non-additive interaction between two alleles in a single gene locus, designated as Vsr1. Genome mapping localized the Vsr1 locus in a 3.8-cM interval delimited by markers XWL954 and XWL2506 on chromosome arm 5DL. When planted in vermiculite with supplemental fertilizer, the F1 hybrid had normal root growth, virtually identical to the parental lines, but the advanced backcrossing populations segregated for VSR, indicating that the F1 VSR expression was suppressed by interactions between other genes in the parental background and the vermiculite conditions. Preliminary physiological analyses showed that the VSR suppression is independent of light status but related to potassium homeostasis. Phenotyping additional hybrids between common wheat and synthetics revealed a high VSR frequency and their segregation data suggested more Vsr loci involved. Because the VSR plants can be regularly maintained and readily phenotyped at the early developmental stage, it provides a model for studies of non-additive interactions in wheat."
"23437172","articletitle","Regulation of wheat seed dormancy by after-ripening is mediated by specific transcriptional switches that induce changes in seed hormone metabolism and signaling."
"23437172","abstracttext","Treatments that promote dormancy release are often correlated with changes in seed hormone content and/or sensitivity. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the role of after-ripening (seed dry storage) in triggering hormone related changes and dormancy decay in wheat (Triticum aestivum), temporal expression patterns of genes related to abscisic acid (ABA), gibberellin (GA), jasmonate and indole acetic acid (IAA) metabolism and signaling, and levels of the respective hormones were examined in dormant and after-ripened seeds in both dry and imbibed states. After-ripening mediated developmental switch from dormancy to germination appears to be associated with declines in seed sensitivity to ABA and IAA, which are mediated by transcriptional repressions of PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2C, SNF1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE2, ABA INSENSITIVE5 and LIPID PHOSPHATE PHOSPHTASE2, and AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR and RELATED TO UBIQUITIN1 genes. Transcriptomic analysis of wheat seed responsiveness to ABA suggests that ABA inhibits the germination of wheat seeds partly by repressing the transcription of genes related to chromatin assembly and cell wall modification, and activating that of GA catabolic genes. After-ripening induced seed dormancy decay in wheat is also associated with the modulation of seed IAA and jasmonate contents. Transcriptional control of members of the ALLENE OXIDE SYNTHASE, 3-KETOACYL COENZYME A THIOLASE, LIPOXYGENASE and 12-OXOPHYTODIENOATE REDUCTASE gene families appears to regulate seed jasmonate levels. Changes in the expression of GA biosynthesis genes, GA 20-OXIDASE and GA 3-OXIDASE, in response to after-ripening implicate this hormone in enhancing dormancy release and germination. These findings have important implications in the dissection of molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of seed dormancy in cereals."
"22791821","articletitle","Genetic and physiological analysis of Rht8 in bread wheat: an alternative source of semi-dwarfism with a reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids."
"22791821","abstracttext","Over the next decade, wheat grain production must increase to meet the demand of a fast growing human population. One strategy to meet this challenge is to raise wheat productivity by optimizing plant stature. The Reduced height 8 (Rht8) semi-dwarfing gene is one of the few, together with the Green Revolution genes, to reduce stature of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and improve lodging resistance, without compromising grain yield. Rht8 is widely used in dry environments such as Mediterranean countries where it increases plant adaptability. With recent climate change, its use could become increasingly important even in more northern latitudes. In the present study, the characterization of Rht8 was furthered. Morphological analyses show that the semi-dwarf phenotype of Rht8 lines is due to shorter internodal segments along the wheat culm, achieved through reduced cell elongation. Physiological experiments show that the reduced cell elongation is not due to defective gibberellin biosynthesis or signalling, but possibly to a reduced sensitivity to brassinosteroids. Using a fine-resolution mapping approach and screening 3104 F(2) individuals of a newly developed mapping population, the Rht8 genetic interval was reduced from 20.5 cM to 1.29 cM. Comparative genomics with model genomes confined the Rht8 syntenic intervals to 3.3 Mb of the short arm of rice chromosome 4, and to 2 Mb of Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 5. The very high resolution potential of the plant material generated is crucial for the eventual cloning of Rht8."
"19493973","articletitle","Evidence for variation in the optimal translation initiation complex: plant eIF4B, eIF4F, and eIF(iso)4F differentially promote translation of mRNAs."
"19493973","abstracttext","Eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4B is known to interact with multiple initiation factors, mRNA, rRNA, and poly(A) binding protein (PABP). To gain a better understanding of the function of eIF4B, the two isoforms from Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were expressed and analyzed using biophysical and biochemical methods. Plant eIF4B was found by ultracentrifugation and light scattering analysis to most likely be a monomer with an extended structure. An extended structure would facilitate the multiple interactions of eIF4B with mRNA as well as other initiation factors (eIF4A, eIF4G, PABP, and eIF3). Eight mRNAs, barley (Hordeum vulgare) alpha-amylase mRNA, rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA, Arabidopsis heat shock protein 21 (HSP21) mRNA, oat (Avena sativa) globulin, wheat (Triticum aestivum) germin, maize (Zea mays) alcohol dehydrogenase, satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA, and alfalfa mosaic virus (AMV) 4, were used in wheat germ in vitro translation assays to measure their dependence on eIF4B and eIF4F isoforms. The two Arabidopsis eIF4B isoforms, as well as native and recombinant wheat eIF4B, showed similar responses in the translation assay. AMV RNA 4 and Arabidopsis HSP21 showed only a slight dependence on the presence of eIF4B isoforms, whereas rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA and wheat germin mRNA showed modest dependence. Barley alpha-amylase, oat globulin, and satellite tobacco necrosis virus RNA displayed the strongest dependence on eIF4B. These results suggest that eIF4B has some effects on mRNA discrimination during initiation of translation. Barley alpha-amylase, oat globulin, and rabbit beta-hemoglobin mRNA showed the highest activity with eIF4F, whereas Arabidopsis HSP21 and AMV RNA 4 used both eIF4F and eIF(iso)4F equally well. These results suggest that differential or optimal translation of mRNAs may require initiation complexes composed of specific isoforms of initiation factor gene products. Thus, individual mRNAs or classes of mRNAs may respond to the relative abundance of a particular initiation factor(s), which in turn may affect the amount of protein translated. It is likely that optimal multifactor initiation complexes exist that allow for optimal translation of mRNAs under a variety of cellular conditions."

"19471904","abstracttext","Common bunt, caused by Tilletia caries (DC.) Tul. & C. Tul. and T. laevis J.G Kuhn, is an economically important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. The resistance in the winter wheat cultivar 'Blizzard' is effective against known races of common bunt in western Canada. The incorporation of resistance from Blizzard into field-ready cultivars may be accelerated through the use of molecular markers. Using the maize pollen method, a doubled haploid population of 147 lines was developed from the F(1) of the second backcross of Blizzard (resistant) by breeding line '8405-JC3C' (susceptible). Doubled haploid lines were inoculated at seeding with race T19 or T19 and L16 and disease reaction was examined under controlled conditions in 1999 and natural conditions in 2002, and 2003. Resistant:susceptible-doubled haploid lines segregated in a 1:1 ratio for bunt reaction, indicating single major gene segregation. Microsatellite primers polymorphic on the parents were screened on the population. Initial qualitative segregation analysis indicated that the wheat microsatellite markers Xgwm374, Xbarc128 and Xgwm264, located on wheat chromosome 1BS, were significantly linked to the resistance locus. Qualitative results were confirmed with quantitative trait locus analysis. The genetic distance, calculated with JoinMap, between the bunt resistance locus and overlapping markers Xgwm374, Xgwm264 and Xbarc128 was 3.9 cM. The three markers were validated on doubled haploid populations BW337/P9502&DAF1BB and Blizzard/P9514-AR17A3E evaluated for common bunt reaction in the growth chamber in 2007. These markers will be useful in selecting for the common bunt resistance from Blizzard and assist in identifying the resistance among potential new sources of resistance."

"19453509","abstracttext","For sustainable solutions to the problem of insect infestation, the study of molecular plant-insect interactions is integral to resistance breeding strategies. This also holds true in the case of wheat (Triticum aestivum), where the Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia, Kurdjumov, RWA) is responsible for significant crop losses in most major wheat producing countries around the world. Our study is focused on gaining a greater understanding of the resistance mechanisms activated by the RWA resistance gene Dn7 by comparing responses following infestation with three different aphid biotypes (RWA-SA, RWA-US1 and RWA-US2). This consisted of analyzing the resistant wheat line 94M370 (containing Dn7) and its susceptible counterpart (Gamtoos) on a transcriptional level with complementary DNA-amplified fragment length polymorphisms (cDNA-AFLPs) using 17 primer combinations, as well as quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) of 10 differentially expressed transcripts. The results of this expression profile analysis suggest that Dn7 activates similar responses against the two US aphid biotypes, which differ noticeably from the response following infestation with a South African aphid biotype. This is consistent with recent research showing limited molecular variations between the two US aphid biotypes (approximately 0.12%), compared with a distinctly different South African biotype. We therefore conclude that Dn7 recognizes and interacts in a highly specific manner with different aphid's putative eliciting agents, which in turn activates specific defense pathways unique to that interaction."

"20675454","abstracttext","There is a significant potential to improve the plant-beneficial effects of root-colonizing pseudomonads by breeding wheat genotypes with a greater capacity to sustain interactions with these bacteria. However, the interaction between pseudomonads and crop plants at the cultivar level, as well as the conditions which favor the accumulation of beneficial microorganisms in the wheat rhizosphere, is largely unknown. Therefore, we characterized the three Swiss winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars Arina, Zinal, and Cimetta for their ability to accumulate naturally occurring plant-beneficial pseudomonads in the rhizosphere. Cultivar performance was measured also by the ability to select for specific genotypes of 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) producers in two different soils. Cultivar-specific differences were found; however, these were strongly influenced by the soil type. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis of fragments of the DAPG biosynthetic gene phlD amplified from natural Pseudomonas rhizosphere populations revealed that phlD diversity substantially varied between the two soils and that there was a cultivar-specific accumulation of certain phlD genotypes in one soil but not in the other. Furthermore, the three cultivars were tested for their ability to benefit from Pseudomonas inoculants. Interestingly, Arina, which was best protected against Pythium ultimum infection by inoculation with Pseudomonas fluorescens biocontrol strain CHA0, was the cultivar which profited the least from the bacterial inoculant in terms of plant growth promotion in the absence of the pathogen. Knowledge gained of the interactions between wheat cultivars, beneficial pseudomonads, and soil types allows us to optimize cultivar-soil combinations for the promotion of growth through beneficial pseudomonads. Additionally, this information can be implemented by breeders into a new and unique breeding strategy for low-input and organic conditions."

"21621021","abstracttext","Drought is one of the major factors limiting the yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) particularly during grain filling. Under terminal drought condition, remobilization of pre-stored carbohydrates in wheat stem to grain has a major contribution in yield. To determine the molecular mechanism of stem reserve utilization under drought condition, we compared stem proteome patterns of two contrasting wheat landraces (N49 and N14) under a progressive post-anthesis drought stress, during which period N49 peduncle showed remarkably higher stem reserves remobilization efficiency compared to N14. Out of 830 protein spots reproducibly detected and analyzed on two-dimensional electrophoresis gels, 135 spots showed significant changes in at least one landrace. The highest number of differentially expressed proteins was observed in landrace N49 at 20days after anthesis when active remobilization of dry matter was observed, suggesting a possible involvement of these proteins in effective stem reserve remobilization of N49. The identification of 82 of differentially expressed proteins using mass spectrometry revealed a coordinated expression of proteins involved in leaf senescence, oxidative stress defense, signal transduction, metabolisms and photosynthesis which might enable N49 to efficiently remobilized its stem reserves compared to N14. The up-regulation of several senescence-associated proteins and breakdown of photosynthetic proteins in N49 might reflect the fact that N49 increased carbon remobilization from the stem to the grains by enhancing senescence. Furthermore, the up-regulation of several oxidative stress defense proteins in N49 might suggest a more effective protection against oxidative stress during senescence in order to protect stem cells from premature cell death. Our results suggest that wheat plant might response to soil drying by efficiently remobilize assimilates from stem to grain through coordinated gene expression."

"22080980","abstracttext","Wheat kernel texture, a major trait determining the end-use quality of wheat flour, is mainly influenced by puroindolines. These small basic proteins display in vitro lipid binding and antimicrobial properties, but their cellular functions during grain development remain unknown. To gain an insight into their biological function, a comparative proteome analysis of two near-isogenic lines (NILs) of bread wheat Triticum aestivum L. cv. Falcon differing in the presence or absence of the puroindoline-a gene (Pina) and kernel hardness, was performed. Proteomes of the two NILs were compared at four developmental stages of the grain for the metabolic albumin/globulin fraction and the Triton-extracted amphiphilic fraction. Proteome variations showed that, during grain development, folding proteins and stress-related proteins were more abundant in the hard line compared with the soft one. These results, taken together with ultrastructural observations showing that the formation of the protein matrix occurred earlier in the hard line, suggested that a stress response, possibly the unfolded protein response, is induced earlier in the hard NIL than in the soft one leading to earlier endosperm cell death. Quantification of the albumin/globulin fraction and amphiphilic proteins at each developmental stage strengthened this hypothesis as a plateau was revealed from the 500 °Cd stage in the hard NIL whereas synthesis continued in the soft one. These results open new avenues concerning the function of puroindolines which could be involved in the storage protein folding machinery, consequently affecting the development of wheat endosperm and the formation of the protein matrix."

"23294838","abstracttext","Currently, there are few studies concerning the function of heavy metal ATPase 2 (HMA2), particularly in monocotyledons, and the potential application of this protein in biofortification and phytoremediation. Thus, we isolated and characterized the TaHMA2 gene from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Our results indicate that TaHMA2 is localized to the plasma membrane and stably expressed, except in the nodes, which showed relatively high expression. Zinc/cadmium (Zn/Cd) resistance was observed in TaHMA2-transformed yeast. The over-expression of TaHMA2 increased the elongation and decreased the seed-setting rate in rice (Oryza sativa L.), but not Arabidopsis thaliana, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) or wheat. TaHMA2 over-expression also improved root-shoot Zn/Cd translocation, especially in rice. The seeds of transgenic rice and wheat, not tobacco, showed decreased Zn concentrations. The Zn concentration was decreased in all parts of the transgenic rice seeds, but was decreased only in the ventral endosperm of wheat, which showed an increased Zn concentration in the embryo and aleurone. The over-expression of TaHMA2 improved plant tolerance under moderate Zn stress and Zn deficiency, but Zn and Cd resistance decreased under high levels of Zn and Cd stress, respectively. The Cd concentration in transgenic rice seedlings was dramatically increased under Zn deficiency. Thus, over-expression of TaHMA2 showed a more obvious phenotype in monocotyledons than in dicotyledons. These findings provide important information for TaHMA2, and more efforts should be made in the future to characterize the reduced Zn concentration in TaHMA2 transgenic grains and the diversity of TaHMA2 substrate specificity."

"23151639","abstracttext","Although the influence of ozone (O(3)) on plants has been well studied in agroecosystems, little is known about the effect of elevated O(3) (eO(3)) on soil microbial functional communities. Here, we used a comprehensive functional gene array (GeoChip 3.0) to investigate the functional composition, and structure of rhizosphere microbial communities of Yannong 19 (O(3)-sensitive) and Yangmai 16 (O(3)-relatively sensitive) wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars under eO(3). Compared with ambient O(3) (aO(3)), eO(3) led to an increase in soil pH and total carbon (C) percentages in grain and straw of wheat plants, and reduced grain weight and soil dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Based on GeoChip hybridization signal intensities, although the overall functional structure of rhizosphere microbial communities did not significantly change by eO(3) or cultivars, the results showed that the abundance of specific functional genes involved in C fixation and degradation, nitrogen (N) fixation, and sulfite reduction did significantly (P<0.05) alter in response to eO(3) and/or wheat cultivars. Also, Yannong 19 appeared to harbor microbial functional communities in the rhizosphere more sensitive in response to eO(3) than Yangmai 16. Additionally, canonical correspondence analysis suggested that the functional structure of microbial community involved in C cycling was largely shaped by soil and plant properties including pH, DOC, microbial biomass C, C/N ratio and grain weight. This study provides new insight into our understanding of the influence of eO(3) and wheat cultivars on soil microbial communities."

The wheat-Thinopyrum intermedium translocation line YW642 carries BYDV resistance gene Bdv2. To explore resistant wheat resistome in response to BYDV infection, we used Affymetrix GeneChip® Wheat Genome Arrays to analyze transcriptomes of YW642 and its susceptible parent Zhong8601 at 12 and 72 h postinoculation with BYDV compared to mock-inoculated controls. Relative to mock-inoculated control, 335 defense-related transcripts were upregulated in BYDV-inoculated YW642, among which 70 were upregulated only in BYDV-inoculated YW642 but not in BYDV-inoculated Zhong8601 through clustering analysis. Additional analysis using BYDV-inoculated Zhong8601 as reference revealed that 59 defense-related transcripts were upregulated in BYDV-inoculated YW642. Comparison of these upregulated defense transcripts obtained via the two analysis ways indicated that 19 overlapped defense-related transcripts were highly expressed in BYDV-inoculated YW642 relative to BYDV-inoculated Zhong8601 and mock-inoculated YW642, which likely are significant factors in Bdv2-mediated defense response to BYDV. High expression of some resistance homologous genes, pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity-related genes, ABC transporter genes, pathogenesis-related protein genes, and genes in reactive oxygen species, phospholipid signaling, and jasmonic acid-signaling may contribute to Bdv2-mediated defense response to BYDV."

"23689741","abstracttext","Hessian fly (HF), Mayetiola destructor, is an important pest of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide. Because it has multiple biotypes that are virulent to different wheat HF resistance genes, pyramiding multiple resistance genes in a cultivar can improve resistance durability, and finding DNA markers tightly linked to these genes is essential to this process. This study identified quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Hessian fly resistance (HFR) in the wheat cultivar 'Clark' and tightly linked DNA markers for the QTLs. A linkage map was constructed with single nucleotide polymorphism and simple sequence repeat markers using a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross 'Ning7840' × 'Clark' by single-seed descent. Two QTLs associated with resistance to fly biotype GP were identified on chromosomes 6B and 1A, with the resistance alleles contributed from 'Clark'. The QTL on 6B flanked by loci Xsnp921 and Xsnp2745 explained about 37.2 % of the phenotypic variation, and the QTL on 1A was flanked by Xgwm33 and Xsnp5150 and accounted for 13.3 % of phenotypic variation for HFR. The QTL on 6B has not been reported before and represents a novel wheat gene with resistance to HF, thus, it is designated H34. A significant positive epistasis was detected between the two QTLs that accounted for about 9.5 % of the mean phenotypic variation and increased HFR by 0.16. Our results indicated that different QTLs may contribute different degrees of resistance in a cultivar and that epistasis may play an important role in HFR."

"24166270","abstracttext","In saline environments, bread wheat, Triticum aestivum L. (genomes AABBDD), accumulates less Na(+) and more K(+) in expanding and young leaves than durum wheat, T. turgidum L. (genomes AABB). Higher K(+)/Na(+) ratios in leaves of bread wheat correlate with its higher salt tolerance. Chromosome 4D from bread wheat was shown in previous work to play an important role in the control of this trait and was recombined with chromosome 4B in the absence of the Ph1 locus. A population of plants disomic for 4D/4B recombined chromosomes in the genetic background of T. turgidum was developed to investigate the genetic control of K(+)/Na(+) discrimination by chromosome 4D. Evidence was obtained that the trait is controlled by a single locus, designated Kna1, in the long arm of chromosome 4D. In the present work, K(+)/Na(+) discrimination was determined for additional families with 4D/4B chromosomes. The concentrations of Na(+) and K(+)/Na(+) ratios in the youngest leaf blades clustered in two nonoverlapping classes, and all recombinant families could be unequivocally assigned to Kna1 and kna1 classes. The Kna1 locus scored this way was mapped on a short region in the 4DL arm and was completely linked to Xwg199, Xabc305, Xbcd.402, Xpsr567, and Xpsr375; it was also mapped as a quantitative trait. The results of the QTL analysis, based on the K(+)/Na(+) ratios in the young leaves of greenhousegrown plants and flag leaves of field-grown plants, agreed with the position of Knal determined as a qualitative trait. Several aspects of gene introgression by manipulation of the Ph1 locus are discussed."
"24197191","articletitle","Mitochondrial gene expression during wheat leaf development."
"24197191","abstracttext","The expression of specific mitochondrial, chloroplast and nuclear genes has been investigated in leaves of 7-d-old light-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Maris Dove). In the wheat leaf there is a spatial separation of a temporal sequence of development from the basal meristem to the distal mature, photosynthetically competent cells. This sequence of cellular differentiation is paralleled by a functional differentiation in which the energy supply changes from oxidative phosphorylation in the non-green meristematic cells to a combined dependence on oxidative and photophosphorylation in the photosynthesizing cells. The changes in copy number per cell and expression of mitochondrial genes have been investigated in successive sections of the wheat leaf using quantitative DNA-DNA and DNA-RNA filter and protein-binding techniques. The abundance of specific mitochondrial genes (cox II.cob andatp A) per cell was found to decrease between five- and tenfold within the basal (1 cm) section of the leaf and then remain constant to the distal tip. The relative abundances of specific mitochondrial transcripts (cox I,cox II,cob andatp A) were found to decrease in successive sections from the basal meristem to the distal tip (from a relative value of 100% to 5-40%). In contrast, transcripts of chloroplast genes and nuclear genes encoding chloroplast polypeptides (psb A,rbc L andrbc S) were found to increase steadily in progressive leaf sections (from a relative value of 0-2% to 100%). The steady-state level of the α-subunit of the mitochondrial F1 ATPase was found to remain constant along the length of the leaf. Possible sites at which the regulation of organellar gene expression is coordinated during the development of photosynthetic competence within the wheat leaf are discussed."

"24965887","abstracttext_key message","We have demonstrated that genomic selection in diverse wheat landraces for resistance to leaf, stem and strip rust is possible, as genomic breeding values were moderately accurate. Markers with large effects in the Bayesian analysis confirmed many known genes, while also discovering many previously uncharacterised genome regions associated with rust scores. Genomic selection, where selection decisions are based on genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) derived from genome-wide DNA markers, could accelerate genetic progress in plant breeding. In this study, we assessed the accuracy of GEBVs for rust resistance in 206 hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum) landraces from the Watkins collection of phenotypically diverse wheat genotypes from 32 countries. The landraces were genotyped for 5,568 SNPs using an Illumina iSelect 9 K bead chip assay and phenotyped for field-based leaf rust (Lr), stem rust (Sr) and stripe rust (Yr) responses across multiple years. Genomic Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (GBLUP) and a Bayesian Regression method (BayesR) were used to predict GEBVs. Based on fivefold cross-validation, the accuracy of genomic prediction averaged across years was 0.35, 0.27 and 0.44 for Lr, Sr and Yr using GBLUP and 0.33, 0.38 and 0.30 for Lr, Sr and Yr using BayesR, respectively. Inclusion of PCR-predicted genotypes for known rust resistance genes increased accuracy more substantially when the marker was diagnostic (Lr34/Sr57/Yr18) for the presence-absence of the gene rather than just linked (Sr2). Investigation of the impact of genetic relatedness between validation and reference lines on accuracy of genomic prediction showed that accuracy will be higher when each validation line had at least one close relationship to the reference lines. Overall, the prediction accuracies achieved in this study are encouraging, and confirm the feasibility of genomic selection in wheat. In several instances, estimated marker effects were confirmed by published literature and results of mapping experiments using Watkins accessions."

"26361472","abstracttext","Alternative hosts increase the difficulty of disease management in crops because these alternate hosts provide additional sources of primary inoculum or refuges for diversity in the pathogen gene pool. Agropyron cristatum (crested wheatgrass), Bromus inermis (smooth bromegrass), Pascopyrum smithii (western wheatgrass), Stipa viridula (green needlegrass), and Thinopyrum intermedium (intermediate wheatgrass), commonly identified in range, prairie, verge, and soil reclamation habitats, serve as additional hosts for Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, the cause of tan spot in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). A. cristatum (five lines), B. inermis (seven lines), P. smithii (four lines), S. viridula (two lines), and T. intermedium (six lines) were tested for their reactions to 30 representative P. tritici-repentis isolates from races 1-5. Plants were grown until the two-three-leaf stage in a greenhouse, inoculated individually with the 30 isolates, held at high humidity for 24 h, and rated after 7 days. All lines developed lesion types 1-2 (resistant) based on a 1-5 rating scale. Also, leaves from an additional plant set were infiltrated with two host selective toxins, Ptr ToxA as a pure preparation and Ptr ToxB as a dilute crude culture filtrate. All lines were insensitive to the toxins. Results indicate that these grass hosts have a limited or nonsignificant role in tan spot epidemiology on wheat in the northern Great Plains. Additionally, the resistant reactions demonstrated by the grass species in this research indicate the presence of resistance genes that can be valuable to wheat breeding programs for improving wheat resistance to P. tritici-repentis."

"25468933","abstracttext","A waxy cuticle that serves as a protective barrier against non-stomatal water loss and environmental damage coats the aerial surfaces of land plants. It comprises a cutin polymer matrix and waxes. Cuticular waxes are complex mixtures of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) and their derivatives. Results show that primary alcohols are the major components of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaf blade cuticular waxes. Here, the characterization of TaFAR5 from wheat cv Xinong 2718, which is allelic to TAA1b, an anther-specific gene, is reported. Evidence is presented for a new function for TaFAR5 in the biosynthesis of primary alcohols of leaf blade cuticular wax in wheat. Expression of TaFAR5 cDNA in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) led to production of C22:0 primary alcohol. The transgenic expression of TaFAR5 in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) cv MicroTom leaves resulted in the accumulation of C26:0, C28:0, and C30:0 primary alcohols. TaFAR5 encodes an alcohol-forming fatty acyl-coenzyme A reductase (FAR). Expression analysis revealed that TaFAR5 was expressed at high levels in the leaf blades, anthers, pistils, and seeds. Fully functional green fluorescent protein-tagged TaFAR5 protein was localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the site of primary alcohol biosynthesis. SDS-PAGE analysis indicated that the TaFAR5 protein possessed a molecular mass of 58.4kDa, and it was also shown that TaFAR5 transcript levels were regulated in response to drought, cold, and abscisic acid (ABA). Overall, these data suggest that TaFAR5 plays an important role in the synthesis of primary alcohols in wheat leaf blade."

"25428996","abstracttext","Heat stress is a significant environmental factor adversely affecting crop yield. Crop adaptation to high-temperature environments requires transcriptional reprogramming of a suite of genes involved in heat stress protection. This study investigated the role of TaHsfA6f, a member of the A6 subclass of heat shock transcription factors, in the regulation of heat stress protection genes in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), a poorly understood phenomenon in this crop species. Expression analysis showed that TaHsfA6f was expressed constitutively in green organs but was markedly up-regulated during heat stress. Overexpression of TaHsfA6f in transgenic wheat using a drought-inducible promoter resulted in up-regulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and a number of other heat stress protection genes that included some previously unknown Hsf target genes such as Golgi anti-apoptotic protein (GAAP) and the large isoform of Rubisco activase. Transgenic wheat plants overexpressing TaHsfA6f showed improved thermotolerance. Transactivation assays showed that TaHsfA6f activated the expression of reporter genes driven by the promoters of several HSP genes (TaHSP16.8, TaHSP17, TaHSP17.3, and TaHSP90.1-A1) as well as TaGAAP and TaRof1 (a co-chaperone) under non-stress conditions. DNA binding analysis revealed the presence of high-affinity TaHsfA6f-binding heat shock element-like motifs in the promoters of these six genes. Promoter truncation and mutagenesis analyses identified TaHsfA6f-binding elements that were responsible for transactivation of TaHSP90.1-A1 and TaGAAP by TaHsfA6f. These data suggest that TaHsfA6f is a transcriptional activator that directly regulates TaHSP, TaGAAP, and TaRof1 genes in wheat and its gene regulatory network has a positive impact on thermotolerance."

"25793656","abstracttext","Wheat beer is a traditional light-colored top-fermenting beer brewed with at least 50% malted (e.g., German Weissbier) or unmalted (e.g., Belgian Witbier) wheat (Triticum aestivum) as an adjunct to barley (Hordeum vulgare) malt. For the first time, we explored the proteome of three Weissbier samples, using both 2D electrophoresis (2DE)-based and 2DE-free strategies. Overall, 58 different gene products arising from barley, wheat, and yeast (Saccharomyces spp.) were identified in the protein fraction of a representative Weissbier sample analyzed in detail. Analogous to all-barley-malt beers (BMB), barley and wheat Z-type serpins and nonspecific lipid transfer proteins dominated the proteome of Weissbier. Several α-amylase/trypsin inhibitors also survived the harsh brewing conditions. During brewing, hundreds of peptides are released into beer. By liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI MS/MS) analysis, we characterized 167 peptides belonging to 44 proteins, including gliadins, hordeins, and high- and low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits. Because of the interference from the overabundant yeast-derived peptides, we identified only a limited number of epitopes potentially triggering celiac disease. However, Weissbier samples contained 374, 372, and 382 ppm gliadin-equivalent peptides, as determined with the competitive G12 ELISA, which is roughly 10-fold higher than a lager BMB (41 ppm), thereby confirming that Weissbier is unsuited for celiacs. Western blot analysis demonstrated that Weissbier also contained large-sized prolamins immunoresponsive to antigliadin IgA antibodies from the pooled sera of celiac patients (n = 4)."

We obtained a novel wheat mutant, dms, characterized as dwarf, multi-pistil and sterility. Although the genetic changes are not clear, the heredity of traits suggests that a recessive gene locus controls the two traits of multi-pistil and sterility in self-pollinating populations of the medium plants (M), such that the dwarf genotype (D) and tall genotype (T) in the progeny of the mutant are ideal lines for studies regarding wheat spike development. The objective of this study was to explore the molecular basis for spike abnormalities of dwarf genotype."

We also identified 143 genes that were significantly different between young spikes of T and D, and 26 genes that were putatively involved in spike differentiation. The result showed that the expression levels of TaAP1-2, TaAP2, and other genes involved in the majority of biological processes such as transcription, translation, cell division, photosynthesis, carbohydrate transport and metabolism, and energy production and conversion were significantly lower in D than in T."

Our results showed that the major causal factors resulting in the spike abnormalities of dms were the lower expression homeotic genes, hormonal imbalance, repressed biological processes, and deficiency of construction materials and energy. We performed a series of studies on the homeotic genes, however the other three causal factors for spike abnormal phenotype of dms need further study."

Five Azospirillum strains were isolated from the rhizosphere of field-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and it was confirmed by BOX-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that the isolates were different and not re-isolates of the same strain. Sequence analysis of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene indicated that four isolates showed maximum similarity to Azospirillum brasilense and one isolate showed maximum similarity to Azospirillum zeae. This is the first report indicating the presence of an A. zeae like isolate in the wheat rhizosphere in Pakistan. The bacterial isolates were characterized for their plant growth-promoting traits, phosphate solubilization, and indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) production. None of the isolates showed phosphate solubilization activity in the commonly used Pikovskaya medium. However, all strains (except AzoK4) exhibited ability to solubilize tricalcium phosphate (TCP) in modified Pikovskaya medium in which sucrose was replaced by Na-malate, as well as in TCP-supplemented Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Organic acids, such as acetic, citric, lactic, malic, and succinic acids, were detected in culture supernatants of the tested Azospirillum strains. All strains exhibited ability to produce IAA in the growth medium, except Azospirillum sp. AzoK1. Among the strains tested, the maximum IAA production (30.49±1.04mgL(-1)) and phosphate solubilization (105.50±4.93mgL(-1)) were shown by a pure culture of Azospirillum sp. AzoK2. In pot experiments, single-strain inocula of Azospirillum sp. AzoK1 and AzoK2 improved wheat plant growth."

"28960410","abstracttext_results","The main quality parameters of CNU609 were significantly improved due to introgression of the 1U genome, including dough development time, stability time, farinograph quality number, gluten index, loaf size and inner structure.

The introgression of the 1U-encoded LMW-GS led to more and larger protein body formation in the CNU609 endosperm. Two new LMW-m type genes from the 1U genome, designated Glu-U3a and Glu-U3b, were cloned and characterized.

"28626005","abstracttext","Controlling the major auxin biosynthetic pathway to manipulate auxin content could be a target for genetic engineering of crops with desired traits, but little progress had been made because low or high auxin contents often cause developmental inhibition. Here, we performed a genome-wide analysis of bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) to identify the Tryptophan Aminotransferase of Arabidopsis1/Tryptophan Aminotransferase-Related (TAA1/TAR) genes that function in the tryptophan-dependent pathway of auxin biosynthesis. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 15 TaTAR genes, among which 12 and three genes were phylogenetically close to Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) AtTAR2 and AtTAR3, respectively. TaTAR2.1 had the most abundant transcripts in the TaTAR2 genes and was expressed mainly in roots and up-regulated by low nitrogen (N) availability. Knockdown of TaTAR2.1 caused vegetative and reproductive deficiencies and impaired lateral root (LR) growth under both high- and low-N conditions. Overexpressing TaTAR2.1-3A in wheat enhanced LR branching, plant height, spike number, grain yield, and aerial N accumulation under different N supply levels. In addition, overexpressing TaTAR2.1-3A in Arabidopsis elevated auxin accumulation in the primary root tip, LR tip, LR primordia, and cotyledon and hypocotyl and increased primary root length, visible LR number, and shoot fresh weight under high- and low-N conditions. Our results indicate that TaTAR2.1 is critical for wheat growth and also shows potential for genetic engineering to reach the aim of improving the grain yield of wheat."

"28542451","abstracttext","Stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Erikks. is an economically important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Hexaploid spring wheat landrace PI 480035 was highly resistant to stripe rust in the field in Washington during 2011 and 2012. The objective of this research was to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for stripe rust resistance in PI 480035. A spring wheat, ""Avocet Susceptible"" (AvS), was crossed with PI 480035 to develop a biparental population of 110 recombinant inbred lines (RIL). The population was evaluated in the field in 2013 and 2014 and seedling reactions were examined against three races (PSTv-14, PSTv-37, and PSTv-40) of the pathogen under controlled conditions. The population was genotyped with genotyping-by-sequencing and microsatellite markers across the whole wheat genome. A major QTL, QYr.wrsggl1-1BS was identified on chromosome 1B. The closest flanking markers were Xgwm273, Xgwm11, and Xbarc187 1.01 cM distal to QYr.wrsggl1-1BS, Xcfd59 0.59 cM proximal and XA365 3.19 cM proximal to QYr.wrsggl1-1BS. Another QTL, QYr.wrsggl1-3B, was identified on 3B, which was significant only for PSTv-40 and was not significant in the field, indicating it confers a race-specific resistance. Comparison with markers associated with previously reported Yr genes on 1B (Yr64, Yr65, and YrH52) indicated that QYr.wrsggl1-1BS is potentially a novel stripe rust resistance gene that can be incorporated into modern breeding materials, along with other all-stage and adult-plant resistance genes to develop cultivars that can provide durable resistance."

"27649990","abstracttext","Gibberellic acid (GA) is involved in the regulation of plant growth and development. We defined GA-stimulated transcript (GAST) gene family and characterized its four members (TaGAST1, 2, 3, and 4) in wheat spikes. Triticum aestivum whole spikes were collected at ten developmental stages and dehulled spikelets were obtained at various days after flowering. Expression of TaGAST1, 2, 3, and 4 was analyzed using RT-PCR at inflorescence development stages, in different tissues, and after phytohormones application. To identify proteins interacting with TaGAST1, yeast two-hybridization was performed and BiFC analysis was used for verification. TaGAST1 was expressed at the inflorescence stage and only expressed in seedlings under abscisic acid (ABA) treatment after phytohormone treatment. TaGAST2 and TaGAST3 showed moderate expression in the spike, vigorous transcript accumulation in the seedling, and up-regulation by exogenous GA in early germination stages. TaGAST4 was predominantly expressed in the seedling. Wheat cyclophilin A-1 (TaCypA1), identified as a TaGAST1-interacting protein, showed opposite expression pattern in the developing spike to TaGAST1. TaCypA1 transcript was slightly up-regulated by GA, slightly down-regulated by paclobutrazol, and was maintained after ABA treatment. The interaction of TaGAST1 with TaCypA1 is targeted to the plasma membrane. TaGAST1 was specifically expressed in the wheat spike and was stimulated by exogenous GA treatment. TaGAST2 and TaGAST3 expression in germinating seeds and seedlings was higher than that in the spike stage. TaGAST4 was not expressed in all developmental stages. TaGAST1 and TaCypA1 might be expressed antagonistically during wheat spike development."
"27995685","articletitle","TaADF4, an actin-depolymerizing factor from wheat, is required for resistance to the stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici."
"27995685","abstracttext","Actin filament assembly in plants is a dynamic process, requiring the activity of more than 75 actin-binding proteins. Central to the regulation of filament assembly and stability is the activity of a conserved family of actin-depolymerizing factors (ADFs), whose primarily function is to regulate the severing and depolymerization of actin filaments. In recent years, the activity of ADF proteins has been linked to a variety of cellular processes, including those associated with response to stress. Herein, a wheat ADF gene, TaADF4, was identified and characterized. TaADF4 encodes a 139-amino-acid protein containing five F-actin-binding sites and two G-actin-binding sites, and interacts with wheat (Triticum aestivum) Actin1 (TaACT1), in planta. Following treatment of wheat, separately, with jasmonic acid, abscisic acid or with the avirulent race, CYR23, of the stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, we observed a rapid induction in accumulation of TaADF4 mRNA. Interestingly, accumulation of TaADF4 mRNA was diminished in response to inoculation with a virulent race, CYR31. Silencing of TaADF4 resulted in enhanced susceptibility to CYR23, demonstrating a role for TaADF4 in defense signaling. Using a pharmacological-based approach, coupled with an analysis of host response to pathogen infection, we observed that treatment of plants with the actin-modifying agent latrunculin B enhanced resistance to CYR23, including increased production of reactive oxygen species and enhancement of localized hypersensitive cell death. Taken together, these data support the hypothesis that TaADF4 positively modulates plant immunity in wheat via the modulation of actin cytoskeletal organization."
"29504038","articletitle","Transcriptome analysis of wheat seedling and spike tissues in the hybrid Jingmai 8 uncovered genes involved in heterosis."
"29504038","abstracttext_main conclusion","Transcriptome analysis was carried out for wheat seedlings and spikes from hybrid Jingmai 8 and both inbred lines to unravel mechanisms underlying heterosis. Heterosis, known as one of the most successful strategies for increasing crop yield, has been widely exploited in plant breeding systems. Despite its great importance, the molecular mechanism underlying heterosis remains elusive. In the present study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on the seedling and spike tissues of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) hybrid Jingmai 8 (JM8) and its homozygous parents to unravel the underlying mechanisms of wheat heterosis. In total, 1686 and 2334 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the hybrid and the two inbred lines in seedling and spike tissues, respectively. Gene Ontology analysis revealed that DEGs from seedling tissues were significantly enriched in processes involved in photosynthesis and carbon fixation, and the majority of these DEGs expressed at a higher level in JM8 compared to both inbred lines. In addition, cell wall biogenesis and protein biosynthesis-related pathways were also significantly represented. These results confirmed that a combination of different pathways could contribute to heterosis. The DEGs between the hybrid and the two inbred progenitors from the spike tissues were significantly enriched in biological processes related to transcription, RNA biosynthesis and molecular function categories related to transcription factor activities. Furthermore, transcription factors such as NAC, ERF, and TIF-IIA were highly expressed in the hybrid JM8. These results may provide valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying wheat heterosis."

"28742872","abstracttext","WRKY transcription factors (TFs) play crucial roles in plant resistance responses to pathogens. Wheat stripe rust, caused by the fungal pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a destructive disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. In this study, the two WRKY genes TaWRKY49 and TaWRKY62 were originally identified in association with high-temperature seedling-plant resistance to Pst (HTSP) resistance in wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6 by RNA-seq. Interestingly, the expression levels of TaWRKY49 and TaWRKY62 were down- and up-regulated, respectively, during HTSP resistance in response to Pst. Silencing of TaWRKY49 enhanced whereas silencing TaWRKY62 reduced HTSP resistance. The enhanced resistance observed on leaves following the silencing of TaWRKY49 was coupled with increased expression of salicylic acid (SA)- and jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive genes TaPR1.1 and TaAOS, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated genes TaCAT and TaPOD; whereas the ethylene (ET)-responsive gene TaPIE1 was suppressed. The decreased resistance observed on leaves following TaWRKY62 silencing was associated with increased expression of TaPR1.1 and TaPOD, and suppression of TaAOS and TaPIE1. Furthermore, SA, ET, MeJA (methyl jasmonate), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and abscisic acid (ABA) treatments increased TaWRKY62 expression. On the other hand, MeJA did not affect the expression of TaWRKY49, and H2O2 reduced TaWRKY49 expression. In conclusion, TaWRKY49 negatively regulates while TaWRKY62 positively regulates wheat HTSP resistance to Pst by differential regulation of SA-, JA-, ET and ROS-mediated signaling."

"30794545","abstracttext","Grain yield is a trait of paramount importance in the breeding of all cereals. In wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), yield has steadily increased since the Green Revolution, though the current rate of increase is not forecasted to keep pace with demand due to growing world population and increasing affluence. While several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on yield and related component traits have been performed in wheat, the previous lack of a reference genome has made comparisons between studies difficult. In this study, a GWAS for yield and yield-related traits was carried out on a population of 322 soft red winter wheat lines across a total of four rain-fed environments in the state of Virginia using single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) marker data generated by a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) protocol. Two separate mixed linear models were used to identify significant marker-trait associations (MTAs). The first was a single-locus model utilizing a leave-one-chromosome-out approach to estimating kinship. The second was a sub-setting kinship estimation multi-locus method (FarmCPU). The single-locus model identified nine significant MTAs for various yield-related traits, while the FarmCPU model identified 74 significant MTAs. The availability of the wheat reference genome allowed for the description of MTAs in terms of both genetic and physical positions, and enabled more extensive post-GWAS characterization of significant MTAs. The results indicate a number of promising candidate genes contributing to grain yield, including an ortholog of the rice aberrant panicle organization (APO1) protein and a gibberellin oxidase protein (GA2ox-A1) affecting the trait grains per square meter, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis thaliana mother of flowering time and terminal flowering 1 (MFT) gene affecting the trait seeds per square meter, and a B2 heat stress response protein affecting the trait seeds per head."

The objectives of this study were to deduce the population structure and marker-trait association for biomass traits in wheat under drought-stressed and non-stressed conditions. A 100-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotype panel was phenotyped for days to heading (DTH), days to maturity (DTM), shoot biomass (SB), root biomass (RB), root to shoot ratio (RS) and grain yield (GY). The panel was sequenced using 15,600 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) markers and subjected to genetic analysis using the compressed mixed linear model (CMLM) at false discovery rate (FDR < 0.05). Population structure analysis revealed six sub-clusters with high membership ancestry coefficient of ≤0.65 to their assigned sub-clusters. A total of 75 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified with a linkage disequilibrium threshold of 0.38 at 5cM. Thirty-seven of the MTAs were detected under drought-stressed condition and 48% were on the B genome, where most quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for RB, SB and GY were previously identified. There were seven pleiotropic markers for RB and SB that may facilitate simultaneous selection. Thirty-seven putative candidate genes were mined by gene annotation on the IWGSC RefSeq 1.1. The significant MTAs observed in this study will be useful in devising strategies for marker-assisted breeding for simultaneous improvement of drought tolerance and to enhance C sequestration capacity of wheat."

Seed dormancy and germination are critical to plant fitness. DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1) is a quantitative trait locus for dormancy in Arabidopsis thaliana. Some interactions between DOG1 and the type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs) have been reported in Arabidopsis. However, the research on molecular functions and regulations of DOG1Ls and group A PP2Cs in wheat (Triticum aestivum. L), an important crop plant, is rare. In this study, the whole TaDOG1L family was identified. Expression analysis revealed that TaDOG1L2, TaDOG1L4 and TaDOG1L-N2 specially expressed in wheat grains, while others displayed distinct expression patterns. Yeast two-hybrid analysis of TaDOG1Ls and group A TaPP2Cs revealed interaction patterns differed from those in Arabidopsis, and TaDOG1L1 and TaDOG1L4 interacted with TaPP2C-a10. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that TaPP2C-a10 exhibited the highest transcript level in wheat grains. Further investigation showed that ectopic expression of TaPP2C-a10 in Arabidopsis promoted seed germination and decreased sensitivity to ABA during germination stage. Additionally, TaPP2C-a10 transgenic Arabidopsis exhibited decreased tolerance to drought stress. Finally, the phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaPP2C-a10 gene was conserved in angiosperm during evolutionary process.

"31177292","abstracttext_key message","Genome-wide association on winter survival was conducted using data from image-based phenotyping method. Nine QTL were observed and three of them with candidate gene identified. Winter survival is an essential trait of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grown in regions with high risk of winterkill. We characterized a diversity panel of 450 Canadian wheat varieties that included mostly winter-growth habit wheats to identify key genetic factors that contribute to higher winter survival under field conditions. To more accurately quantify winter survival differences among varieties, image-based phenotyping methods, captured by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and on ground level, were used to estimate the winter survival of each varieties. Winter survival index was developed to correct for emergence when evaluating winter survival. Winter survival measurement estimated by visual estimation, UAV imagery and ground imagery showed strong correlation with each other and had comparable broad-sense heritability. Genome-wide association studies resulted in the identification of seven quantitative trait loci (QTL) for winter survival including Vrn-A1. By using the recently released annotated sequence of the wheat genome and the available RNA-Seq data, two putative candidate genes underlying the QTL for winter survival were identified. However, our study showed that certain QTL was unique to specific winter survival measurement. Collectively, our study demonstrated the feasibility of using UAV-based imagery for the identification of loci associated with winter survival in wheat. The complexity of in-field condition make our result a valuable complement to indoor frost-tolerance studies in the identification of genetic factors not directly linked to freezing tolerance."

"31277523","abstracttext","The ubiquitin proteasome 26S system (UPS), involving monomeric and multimeric E3 ligases is one of the most important signaling pathways in many organisms, including plants. The SCF (SKP1/Cullin/F-box) multimeric complex is particularly involved in response to development and stress signaling. The SKP1 protein (S-phase kinase-associated protein 1) is the core subunit of this complex. In this work, we firstly identified 92 and 87 non-redundant Triticum aestivum SKP1-like ( TaSKP ) genes that were retrieved from the latest release of the wheat genome database (International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) RefSeq v1.0) and the genome annotation of the TGAC v1 respectively. We then investigated the structure, phylogeny, duplication events and expression patterns of the SKP1-like gene family in various tissues and environmental conditions using a wheat expression platform containing public data. TaSKP1-like genes were expressed differentially in response to stress conditions, displaying large genomic variations or short insertions/deletions which suggests functional specialization within TaSKP1-like genes. Finally, interactions between selected wheat FBX (F-box) proteins and putative ancestral TaSKP1-like proteins were tested using the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system to examine the molecular interactions. These observations suggested that six Ta-SKP1 genes are likely to be ancestral genes, having similar functions as ASK1 and ASK2 in Arabidopsis, OSK1 and OSK20 in rice and PpSKP1 and PpSKP2 in Physcomitrella patens ."
"31540949","articletitle","ABA-Induced Sugar Transporter TaSTP6 Promotes Wheat Susceptibility to Stripe Rust."
"31540949","abstracttext","Biotrophic pathogens, such as wheat rust fungi, survive on nutrients derived from host cells. Sugar appears to be the major carbon source transferred from host cells to various fungal pathogens; however, the molecular mechanism by which host sugar transporters are manipulated by fungal pathogens for nutrient uptake is poorly understood. TaSTP6, a sugar transporter protein in wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), was previously shown to exhibit enhanced expression in leaves upon infection by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), the causal agent of wheat stripe rust. In this study, we found that Pst infection caused increased accumulation of abscisic acid (ABA) and that application of exogenous ABA significantly enhanced TaSTP6 expression. Moreover, knockdown of TaSTP6 expression by barley stripe mosaic virus-induced gene silencing reduced wheat susceptibility to the Pst pathotype CYR31, suggesting that TaSTP6 expression upregulation contributes to Pst host sugar acquisition. Consistent with this, TaSTP6 overexpression in Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ) promoted plant susceptibility to powdery mildew and led to increased Glc accumulation in the leaves. Functional complementation assays in Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that TaSTP6 has broad substrate specificity, indicating that TaSTP6 is an active sugar transporter. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that TaSTP6 localizes to the plasma membrane. Yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation experiments revealed that TaSTP6 undergoes oligomerization. Taken together, our results suggest that Pst stimulates ABA biosynthesis in host cells and thereby upregulates TaSTP6 expression, which increases sugar supply and promotes fungal infection."

"33016597","abstracttext_core ideas","Variations in 16 seedling traits under normal and drought conditions were investigated. Extremely resistant and sensitive accessions were identified for future analyses. Under normal and drought conditions, 57 and 29 QTL were identified, respectively. A total of 77 candidate genes were identified, and four were validated by qRT-PCR. Drought is one of the most important abiotic stressors affecting wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) production. To improve wheat yield, a better understanding of the genetic control of traits governing drought resistance is paramount. Here, using 645 wheat landraces, we evaluated 16 seedling traits related to root and shoot growth and water content under normal and drought (induced by polyethylene glycol) conditions. Extremely resistant and sensitive accessions were identified for future drought-resistance breeding and further genetic analyses. A genome-wide association study was performed for the 16 traits using 52,118 diversity arrays technology sequencing (DArT-seq) markers. A total of 57 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were detected for seven traits under normal conditions, whereas 29 QTL were detected for eight traits under drought conditions. On the basis of these markers, we identified 56 candidate genes for six seedling traits under normal conditions, and 21 candidate genes for seven seedling traits under drought conditions. Four candidate genes were validated under normal and drought conditions using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) data. The co-localization of the flowering date and drought-related traits indicates that the regulatory networks of flowering may also respond to drought stress or are associated with the correlated responses of these traits. The phenotypic and genetic elucidation of drought-related traits will assist future gene discovery efforts and provide a basis for breeding drought-resistant wheat cultivars."

"32719416","abstracttext","Grain quality traits determine the classification of registered wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties. Although environmental factors and crop management practices exert a considerable influence on wheat quality traits, a significant proportion of the variance is attributed to the genetic factors. To identify the underlying genetic factors of wheat quality parameters viz., grain protein content (GPC), grain starch content (GSC), and grain hardness (GH), we evaluated 372 diverse European wheat varieties in replicated field trials in up to eight environments. We observed that all of the investigated traits hold a wide and significant genetic variation, and a significant negative correlation exists between GPC and GSC plus grain yield. Our association analyses based on 26,694 high-quality single nucleotide polymorphic markers revealed a strong quantitative genetic nature of GPC and GSC with associations on groups 2, 3, and 6 chromosomes. The identification of known Puroindoline-b gene for GH provided a positive analytic proof for our studies. We report that a locus QGpc.ipk-6A controls both GPC and GSC with opposite allelic effects. Based on wheat's reference and pan-genome sequences, the physical characterization of two loci viz., QGpc.ipk-2B and QGpc.ipk-6A facilitated the identification of the candidate genes for GPC. Furthermore, by exploiting additive and epistatic interactions of loci, we evaluated the prospects of predictive breeding for the investigated traits that suggested its efficient use in the breeding programs."

"10985049","abstracttext","Twenty-three Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), populations collected in the southeastern (Alabama and Mississippi), midwestern (Indiana), and northwestern (Idaho and Washington) United States from 1995 to 1999 were evaluated for biotype composition based on response to Hessian fly resistance genes H3, H5, H6, and H7H8 in wheat, Triticum aestivum L. Biotypes L and O, combined, made up at least 60% of all Alabama populations. Biotype L was predominant in the northern third of Alabama and biotype O in the southern two-thirds of the state. Based on biotype data, wheat cultivars with H7H8 resistance should be highly effective in central and southern Alabama. Fifty-four percent of the Mississippi population consisted of biotype L, and the remaining virulent biotypes (B, D, E, G, J, and O) ranged in frequency from 1 to 17%. The Mississippi population also contained 4% of the avirulent biotype GP. Only biotypes D and L were found in Indiana populations, but biotype L was predominant. Hessian fly populations from Idaho and Washington contained one or more of the virulent biotypes D-H, J, and L-O; however, only biotypes E, F, and G occurred at frequencies > 12%. The avirulent biotype GP made up 25-57% of Idaho and Washington populations, a much higher percentage than found in populations from the eastern United States. Although the highest level of virulence in Idaho and Washington populations was found to resistance genes H3 and H6, the frequency of biotype GP would indicate that the currently deployed gene H3 would provide a moderate to high level of resistance, depending on location. Nine of the populations, plus populations collected from the mid-Atlantic state area in 1989 and 1996, also were tested against the wheat cultivar 'INW9811' that carries H13 resistance to Hessian fly biotype L and two Purdue wheat lines with unidentified genes for resistance. The H13 resistance in INW9811 was highly effective against all populations tested from the eastern and northwestern U.S. wheat production areas, except Maryland and Virginia. Population studies also indicated that wheat line CI 17960-1-1-2-4-2-10 likely carries the H13 resistance gene, based on the similarity of its response and that of INW9811 to eight fly populations. Continued monitoring of biotype frequency in Hessian fly populations is required for optimal deployment and management of resistance genes in all wheat production areas."

However, its productivity is challenged by various biotic and abiotic stresses such as fungal diseases, insects, drought, salinity, and cold. Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression in different tissues and at various developmental stages in plants and animals, and they can be identified and classified into families according to their structural and specialized DNA-binding domains (DBDs). Transcription factors are important regulatory components of the genome, and are the main targets for engineering stress tolerance."
"25766308","abstracttext_results","In total, 2407 putative TFs were identified from wheat expressed sequence tags, and then classified into 63 families by using Hmm searches against hidden Markov model (HMM) profiles.

"11851918","abstracttext","Homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (pistillody) has been observed in a cytoplasmic substitution (alloplasmic) line of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cv. Norin 26, which has the cytoplasm of a wild relative species, Aegilops crassa L. On the other hand, an alloplasmic line of wheat cv. Chinese Spring (CS) with Ae. crassa cytoplasm has normal flowers. This is due to the presence in the CS nucleus of a fertility-restoring gene, Rfd1. Deletion mapping analysis revealed that Rfd1 is located on the middle part of the long arm of chromosome 7B. To investigate the function of the Rfd1 gene by a loss-of-function strategy, we produced alloplasmic lines of CS ditelosomic 7BS [(cr)-CSdt7BS] and CS monotelodisomic 7BS [(cr)-CSmd7BS] with the Ae. crassa cytoplasm, and characterized their phenotypes. The line (cr)-CSdt7BS without Rfd1 exhibited pistillody in all florets, and also female sterility. Scanning electron microscopy of the young spikes revealed that the pistillody was induced at an early stage of stamen development. The pistillate stamens often developed incomplete ovule-like structures with integuments instead of tapetum and pollen grains. It is possible that MADS box genes are associated with the induction of pistillody, because the expression of wheat APETALA3 homologue (WAP3) was reduced in the young spikes of (cr)-CSdt7BS. In addition, a histological study indicated that the female sterility in (cr)-CSdt7BS is due to the abnormality of the ovule, which fails to form an inner epidermis and integuments in the chalaza region. The line (cr)-CSmd7BS, hemizygous for Rfd1, showed partial pistillody (51%) and restored female fertility up to 72%. These results suggest that the induction of both pistillody and ovule deficiency caused by the Ae. crassa cytoplasm is inhibited by the Rfd1 gene in a dose-dependent manner."

"19740035","abstracttext","Stripe rust (yellow rust), caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, is one of the most devastating foliar diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Growing resistant cultivars is the best approach for control of the disease. Although the stripe rust resistance in spring wheat cv. Zak has been circumvented by a group of races of the pathogen predominant in the United States since 2000, the resistance genes in Zak were unknown. To identify and map the genes for resistance to stripe rust, Zak was crossed with susceptible wheat genotype 'Avocet Susceptible'. Seedlings of the parents and F1, F2, and F3 progeny were tested with P. striiformis f. sp. tritici races PST-43 and PST-45 under controlled greenhouse conditions. Genetic analysis determined that Zak has a single dominant gene, designated as YrZak, conferring race-specific all-stage resistance. Resistance gene analog polymorphism (RGAP), simple sequence repeat (SSR), and sequence-tagged site (STS) techniques were used to identify molecular markers linked to YrZak. A linkage group of three RGAP, three SSR, and three STS markers was constructed for YrZak using 205 F3 lines. Amplification of the complete set of Chinese Spring nulli-tetrasomic lines with RGAP marker Xwgp102 indicated that YrZak is present on chromosome 2B. The three SSR markers further mapped YrZak to the long arm of chromosome 2B. Amplification of chromosome 2B deletion lines with SSR marker Xgwm501 further confirmed that YrZak is on chromosome 2BL. To determine the genetic distance between YrZak and Yr5, which also is present on chromosome 2BL, 300 F2 plants from cross Zak/Yr5 were tested with PST-43. Six susceptible plants were identified from the F2 population, indicating that YrZak and Yr5 are approximately 42 centimorgans apart. The results of race reactions and chromosomal locations indicated that YrZak is different from previously identified genes for resistance to stripe rust. This gene should be useful in monitoring virulence changes in the pathogen population and in studying host-pathogen interactions."

"19585272","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight, also called scab, is a serious disease of small grain cereals and maize. Scab can not only cause yield loss, more seriously is that it can also deteriorate seed quality by contaminating the infected grains with trichothecenes toxins harmful to human and animal health. Deoxynivalenol (DON) is one of the most important toxin members. It was proposed that DON acted first as a virulence factor during fungal pathogenesis and then accumulated in grain to levels posing a threat to human and animal health. In the present research, by expression analysis of DON-induced samples using GeneChip Wheat Genome Array ( http://www.affymetrix.com/products/arrays/specific/wheat.affx ), a DON-resistance related gene TaUGT3 (GenBank accession FJ236328) was cloned and characterized from a scab resistant wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety Wangshuibai. The full-length cDNA of TaUGT3 was 1,755 bp and contained a putative open reading frame (ORF) with 496 amino acids encoding a UDP-glucosyltransferase (UGT). TaUGT3 showed high similarity in amino acid level with DOGT1 gene in Arabidopsis, which is able to detoxify DON. TaUGT3 was located on the group 3 chromosomes of wheat using nulli-tetrasomic lines and deletion lines of Chinese Spring. Co-transformed of TaUGT3 with GFP genes to onion epidermis cells using transient transformation technique by microprojectile bombardment indicated the subcellular location of the protein encoded by TaUGT3 was in the plasma membrane and nuclear. Transformation and overexpression of the TaUGT3 gene in Arabidopsis could enhance tolerance against DON."
"26324889","articletitle","Identification of the VERNALIZATION 4 gene reveals the origin of spring growth habit in ancient wheats from South Asia."
"26324889","abstracttext","Wheat varieties with a winter growth habit require long exposures to low temperatures (vernalization) to accelerate flowering. Natural variation in four vernalization genes regulating this requirement has favored wheat adaptation to different environments. The first three genes (VRN1-VRN3) have been cloned and characterized before. Here we show that the fourth gene, VRN-D4, originated by the insertion of a ∼290-kb region from chromosome arm 5AL into the proximal region of chromosome arm 5DS. The inserted 5AL region includes a copy of VRN-A1 that carries distinctive mutations in its coding and regulatory regions. Three lines of evidence confirmed that this gene is VRN-D4: it cosegregated with VRN-D4 in a high-density mapping population; it was expressed earlier than other VRN1 genes in the absence of vernalization; and induced mutations in this gene resulted in delayed flowering. VRN-D4 was found in most accessions of the ancient subspecies Triticum aestivum ssp. sphaerococcum from South Asia. This subspecies showed a significant reduction of genetic diversity and increased genetic differentiation in the centromeric region of chromosome 5D, suggesting that VRN-D4 likely contributed to local adaptation and was favored by positive selection. Three adjacent SNPs in a regulatory region of the VRN-D4 first intron disrupt the binding of GLYCINE-RICH RNA-BINDING PROTEIN 2 (TaGRP2), a known repressor of VRN1 expression. The same SNPs were identified in VRN-A1 alleles previously associated with reduced vernalization requirement. These alleles can be used to modulate vernalization requirements and to develop wheat varieties better adapted to different or changing environments."

"25447637","abstracttext_key message","TaWD40D that encodes a member of WD40 family proteins is a novel gene involved in the wheat response to abiotic stress. TaWD40D functions as a positive regulator of plant responses to salt stress and osmotic stress in plant. Abiotic stresses can severely affect plant growth and crop productivity. WD40 repeat-containing proteins play a key role in protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions by acting as scaffolding molecules and promoting protein activity. In this study, a stress-inducible gene, TaWD40D, was identified from Chinese spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). TaWD40D encodes a protein containing seven WD40 domains. Subcellular localization in Nicotiana benthamiana mesophyll cells and Arabidopsis root cells showed the presence of TaWD40D in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Heterologous overexpression of TaWD40D in Arabidopsis greatly increased plant tolerance to abscisic acid (ABA), salt stress, and osmotic stress during seed germination and seedling development. The expression patterns of two genes from the SOS pathway (SOS2 and SOS3) and three ABA genes (ABI2, RAB18 and DREB2A) functioning in ABA-dependent and ABA-independent pathways were altered in the transgenic lines overexpressing TaWD40D under the treatments. Notably, the basal level of the ABI2 expression was substantially increased in the TaWD40D overexpression lines. The down-regulation of TaWD40D in wheat by virus-induced gene silencing resulted in a decreased relative water content and less vigorous growth compared to non-silenced lines. Our results suggest that TaWD40D functions as a positive regulator of plant responses to salt stress and osmotic stress that could be utilized for the genetic improvement of stress tolerance in crop plants."

"27145738","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Wheat high-temperature seedling plant (HTSP) resistance to Pst is non-race-specific and durable. WRKY transcription factors have been proven to play important roles in plant defence responses to attacks by several pathogens. However, there is no direct evidence as to whether WRKY transcription factors play a role in HTSP resistance to Pst. We isolated a WRKY gene, named TaWRKY70, from wheat cultivar Xiaoyan 6. The expression level of TaWRKY70 was increased significantly when exposed to high temperatures (HTs) during the initial symptom expression stage of Pst infection. The expression of this gene increased in plants treated with ethylene (ET), salicylic acid (SA) and cold (4°C) stresses, but decreased in plants treated with methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and heat (40°C) stresses. Silencing of TaWRKY70 led to greater susceptibility to Pst (in terms of the increase in length of uredinial pustules and the decrease in the number of necrotic cells) compared with non-silenced plants when exposed to HT during the initial symptom expression stage of Pst infection, coinciding with expression changes of the ET- and SA-responsive genes TaPIE1 and TaPR1.1. In contrast, the expression level of the jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive gene TaAOS was not affected by TaWRKY70. These results indicate that TaWRKY70 is positively involved in HTSP resistance, during which SA and ET signalling are probably activated."

"26948878","abstracttext","Seed germination under the appropriate environmental conditions is important both for plant species survival and for successful agriculture. Seed dormancy, which controls germination time, is one of the adaptation mechanisms and domestication traits [1]. Seed dormancy is generally defined as the absence of germination of a viable seed under conditions that are favorable for germination [2]. The seed dormancy of cultivated plants has generally been reduced during domestication [3]. Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most widely grown crops in the world. Weak dormancy may be an advantage for the productivity due to uniform emergence and a disadvantage for the risks of pre-harvest sprouting (PHS), which decreases grain quality and yield [4]. A number of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) controlling natural variation of seed dormancy have been identified on various chromosomes [5]. A major QTL for seed dormancy has been consistently detected on chromosome 4A [6-13]. The QTL was designated as a major gene, Phs1, which could be precisely mapped within a 2.6 cM region [14]. Here, we identified a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) gene (designated TaMKK3-A) by a map-based approach as a candidate gene for the seed dormancy locus Phs1 on chromosome 4A in bread wheat. Complementation analysis showed that transformation of a dormant wheat cultivar with the TaMKK3-A allele from a nondormant cultivar clearly reduced seed dormancy. Cultivars differing in dormancy had a single nonsynonymous amino acid substitution in the kinase domain of the predicted MKK3 protein sequence, which may be associated with the length of seed dormancy."

"29259104","abstracttext","Cold acclimation and winter survival in cereal species is determined by complicated environmentally regulated gene expression. However, studies investigating these complex cold responses are mostly conducted in controlled environments that only consider the responses to single environmental variables. In this study, we have comprehensively profiled global transcriptional responses in crowns of field-grown spring and winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) genotypes and their near-isogenic lines with the VRN-A1 alleles swapped. This in-depth analysis revealed multiple signaling, interactive pathways that influence cold tolerance and phenological development to optimize plant growth and development in preparation for a wide range of over-winter stresses. Investigation of genetic differences at the VRN-A1 locus revealed that a vernalization requirement maintained a higher level of cold response pathways while VRN-A1 genetically promoted floral development. Our results also demonstrated the influence of genetic background on the expression of cold and flowering pathways. The link between delayed shoot apex development and the induction of cold tolerance was reflected by the gradual up-regulation of abscisic acid-dependent and C-REPEAT-BINDING FACTOR pathways. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of key genes involved in meristem development as the autumn progressed. The chromosome location of differentially expressed genes between the winter and spring wheat genetic backgrounds showed a striking pattern of biased gene expression on chromosomes 6A and 6D, indicating a transcriptional regulation at the genome level. This finding adds to the complexity of the genetic cascades and gene interactions that determine the evolutionary patterns of both phenological development and cold tolerance traits in wheat."

"28798752","abstracttext","CIMMYT wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) lines Francolin#1 and Quaiu#3 displayed effective and stable adult plant resistance (APR) to Chinese Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici isolates in the field. To elucidate their genetic basis of resistance, two recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations of their crosses with Avocet, the susceptible parent, were phenotyped in Zhengzhou and Shangqiu in the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 cropping seasons. These populations were also genotyped with SSR (simple sequence repeat markers) and DArT (diversity arrays technology) markers. Two common significant quantitative trait loci (QTL) on wheat chromosomes 1BL and 4BL were detected in both populations by joint and individual inclusive composite interval mapping, explaining 20.3-28.7% and 9.6-15.9% of the phenotypic variance in Avocet × Francolin#1 and 4.8-11.5% and 10.8-18.9% in Avocet × Quaiu#3, respectively. Additional QTL were mapped on chromosomes 1DL and 5BL in Avocet × Francolin#1 and on 2DL and 6BS in Avocet × Quaiu#3. Among these, QPm.heau-1DL is probably a novel APR gene contributing 6.1-8.5% of total phenotypic variance. The QTL on 1BL corresponds to the pleiotropic multi-pathogen resistance gene Yr29/Lr46 / Pm39 , whereas the QTL on 2DL maps to a similar region where stripe rust resistance gene Yr54 is located. The QTL identified can potentially be used for the improvement of powdery mildew and rust resistance in wheat breeding."

The virus-mediated overexpression (VOX) vectors based on Barley stripe mosaic virus and Wheat streak mosaic virus described previously for these species are incapable of expressing free recombinant proteins of more than 150 to 250 amino acids, are not suited for high-throughput screens, and have other limitations. In this study, we report the development of a VOX vector based on a monopartite single-stranded positive sense RNA virus, Foxtail mosaic virus (genus Potexvirus ). In this vector, PV101, the gene of interest was inserted downstream of the duplicated subgenomic promoter of the viral coat protein gene, and the corresponding protein was expressed in its free form. The vector allowed the expression of a 239-amino acid-long GFP in both virus-inoculated and upper uninoculated (systemic) leaves of wheat and maize and directed the systemic expression of a larger approximately 600-amino acid protein, GUSPlus, in maize. Moreover, we demonstrated that PV101 can be used for in planta expression and functional analysis of apoplastic pathogen effector proteins such as the host-specific toxin ToxA of Parastagonospora nodorum Therefore, this VOX vector opens possibilities for functional genomics studies in two important cereal crops."

"31064813","abstracttext","Senescence is a tightly regulated developmental program coordinated by transcription factors. Identifying these transcription factors in crops will provide opportunities to tailor the senescence process to different environmental conditions and regulate the balance between yield and grain nutrient content. Here, we use ten time points of gene expression data along with gene network modeling to identify transcription factors regulating senescence in polyploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum ). We observe two main phases of transcriptional changes during senescence: early down-regulation of housekeeping functions and metabolic processes followed by up-regulation of transport and hormone-related genes. These two phases are largely conserved with Arabidopsis ( Arabidopsis thaliana ), although the individual genes underlying these changes are often not orthologous. We have identified transcription factor families associated with these early and later waves of differential expression. Using gene regulatory network modeling, we identified candidate transcription factors that may control senescence. Using independent, publicly available datasets, we found that the most highly ranked candidate genes in the network were enriched for senescence-related functions compared with all genes in the network. We validated the function of one of these candidate transcription factors in senescence using wheat chemically induced mutants. This study lays the groundwork to understand the transcription factors that regulate senescence in polyploid wheat and exemplifies the integration of time-series data with publicly available expression atlases and networks to identify candidate regulatory genes."

"32620083","abstracttext_background","The genetics of resistance to loose smut of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) caused by the fungus Ustilago tritici (Pers.) Rostr. is not well understood. This study examines loose smut resistance in Sonop (TD-14), a South African spring wheat variety. A doubled haploid (DH) population of 163 lines derived from the cross Diamont/TD-14 was studied. The parents and progenies were inoculated with U. tritici races T2, T9, and T39 individually in growth facilities at Morden and Swift Current, Canada. Loose smut incidence (LSI) and partial loose smut resistance (PLSR) were assessed."
"32620083","abstracttext_results","A whole genome linkage map was developed consisting of 11,519 SNP loci found on 31 linkage groups spanning 2845 cM. A new major resistance gene Ut11 was located to the distal end of chromosome arm 7BS. Ut11 conferred resistance to U. tritici race T2, but not races T9 and T39. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified four QTL controlling LSI in the Diamont/TD-14 DH population on chromosomes 3B, 4B, 5B, and 7B (at Ut11) with TD-14 contributing the resistance alleles at three of these loci. The major QTL QUt.mrc-5B was effective against all three races and explained up to 81% of the phenotypic variation. The only QTL identified for PLSR coincided with the LSI QTL QUt.mrc-5B indicating that this locus affected both loose smut incidence and partial smutting of spikes."
"32620083","abstracttext_conclusions","A race-specific resistance gene Ut11 and a broadly effective resistance QTL QUt.mrc-5B were the main loci controlling loose smut resistance in the differential line TD-14 (cultivar Sonop). This study provides insight into the genetics of loose smut resistance in spring wheat Sonop and the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers linked to the resistance gene Ut11 and QTL QUt.mrc-5B will be useful for selecting loose smut resistance in breeding programs."
"32494869","articletitle","Introgression of perennial growth habit from Lophopyrum elongatum into wheat."
"32494869","abstracttext_key message","A locus for perennial growth was mapped on Lophopyrum elongatum chromosome arm 4ES and introgressed into the wheat genome. Evidence was obtained that in addition to chromosome 4E, other L. elongatum chromosomes control perennial growth. Monocarpy versus polycarpy is one of the fundamental developmental dichotomies in flowering plants. Advances in the understanding of the genetic basis of this dichotomy are important for basic biological reasons and practically for genetic manipulation of growth development in economically important plants. Nine wheat introgression lines (ILs) harboring germplasm of the Lophopyrum elongatum genome present in the octoploid amphiploid Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (subgenomes AABBDD) × L. elongatum (genomes EE) were selected from a population of ILs developed earlier. These ILs were employed here in genomic analyses of post-sexual cycle regrowth (PSCR), which is a component of polycarpy in caespitose L. elongatum. Analyses of disomic substitution (DS) lines confirmed that L. elongatum chromosome 4E confers PSCR on wheat. The gene was mapped into a short distal region of L. elongatum arm 4ES and was tentatively named Pscr1. ILs harboring recombined chromosomes with 4ES segments, including Pscr1, incorporated into the distal part of the 4DS chromosome arm were identified. Based on the location, Pscr1 is not orthologous with the rice rhizome-development gene Rhz2 located on rice chromosome Os3, which is homoeologous with chromosome 4E, but it may correspond to the Teosinte branched1 (TB1) gene, which is located in the introgressed region in the L. elongatum and Ae. tauschii genomes. A hexaploid IL harboring a large portion of the E-genome but devoid of chromosome 4E also expressed PSCR, which provided evidence that perennial growth is controlled by genes on other L. elongatum chromosomes in addition to 4E."
"30727527","articletitle","Characterization of Resistance to Stripe Rust in Contemporary Cultivars and Lines of Winter Wheat from the Eastern United States."
"30727527","abstracttext","Stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, has been an important disease of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) in the eastern United States since 2000, when a new strain of the pathogen emerged. The new strain overcame the widely used resistance gene, Yr9, and was more aggressive and better adapted to warmer temperatures than the old strain. Host resistance is the most effective approach to manage stripe rust. Winter wheat lines with resistance to the new strain in the field are common, but the genes conferring this resistance are mostly unknown. The objectives of this research were to characterize the all-stage resistance and adult-plant resistance (APR) to stripe rust in a representative group of contemporary winter wheat cultivars and breeding lines and to identify the resistance genes when possible. Of the 50 lines evaluated for all-stage resistance at the seedling stage, nearly all were susceptible to the new strain. Based on a linked molecular marker, seven lines had resistance gene Yr17 that confers resistance to both old and new strains; however, this resistance was difficult to identify in the seedling stage. Of the 19 lines evaluated for APR, all expressed APR compared with a very susceptible check. Nine had race-specific APR to the new strain and nine had APR to both old and new strains. The remaining line, 26R61, had all-stage resistance to the old strain (conferred by resistance gene Yr9) and a high level of APR to the new strain. APR was expressed as low infection type, low percent leaf area diseased, and long latent period at heading stage under both low and high temperature regimes and could be identified as early as jointing stage. Based on tests for linked molecular markers, the most widely used slow-rusting APR genes, Yr18 and Yr29, were not present in any of the lines. The results of this research indicate that effective all-stage resistance was conferred only by Yr17 and that APR was common and likely conferred by unknown race-specific genes rather than genes conferring slow rusting that are more likely to be durable."

"30586859","abstracttext","The EXO70 gene family is involved in different biological processes in plants, ranging from plant polar growth to plant immunity. To date, analysis of the EXO70 gene family has been limited in Triticeae species, e.g., hexaploidy Triticum aestivum and its ancestral/related species. By in silico analysis of multiple Triticeae sequence databases, a total of 200 EXO70 members were identified. By homologue cloning approaches, 15 full-length cDNA of EXO70s were cloned from diploid Haynaldia villosa . Phylogenetic relationship analysis of 215 EXO70 members classified them into three groups ( EXO70.1 , EXO70.2 , and EXO70.3 ) and nine subgroups ( EXO70A to EXO70I ). The distribution of most EXO70 genes among different species/sub-genomes were collinear, implying their orthologous relationship. The EXO70A subgroup has the most introns (at least five introns), while the remaining seven subgroups have only one intron on average. The expression profiling of EXO70 genes from wheat revealed that 40 wheat EXO70 genes were expressed in at least one tissue (leaf, stem, or root), of which 25 wheat EXO70 genes were in response to at least one biotic stress (stripe rust or powdery mildew) or abiotic stress (drought or heat). Subcellular localization analysis showed that ten EXO70-V proteins had distinct plasma membrane localization, EXO70I1-V showed a distinctive spotted pattern on the membrane. The 15 EXO70-V genes were differentially expressed in three tissue. Apart from EXO70D2-V , the remaining EXO70-V genes were in response to at least one stress (flg22, chitin, powdery mildew, drought, NaCl, heat, or cold) or phytohormones (salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, ethephon, or abscisic acid) and hydrogen peroxide treatments. This research provides a genome-wide glimpse of the Triticeae EXO70 gene family and those up- or downregulated genes require further validation of their biological roles in response to biotic/abiotic stresses."
"31853574","articletitle","Dmc1 is a candidate for temperature tolerance during wheat meiosis."
"31853574","abstracttext_key message","The meiotic recombination gene Dmc1 on wheat chromosome 5D has been identified as a candidate for the maintenance of normal chromosome synapsis and crossover at low and possibly high temperatures. We initially assessed the effects of low temperature on meiotic chromosome synapsis and crossover formation in the hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety 'Chinese Spring'. At low temperatures, asynapsis and chromosome univalence have been observed before in Chinese Spring lines lacking the long arm of chromosome 5D (5DL), which led to the proposal that 5DL carries a gene (Ltp1) that stabilises wheat chromosome pairing at low temperatures. In the current study, Chinese Spring wild type and 5DL interstitial deletion mutant plants were exposed to low temperature in a controlled environment room during a period from premeiotic interphase to early meiosis I. A 5DL deletion mutant was identified whose meiotic chromosomes exhibit extremely high levels of asynapsis and chromosome univalence at metaphase I after 7 days at 13 °C, suggesting that Ltp1 is deleted in this mutant. Immunolocalisation of the meiotic proteins ASY1 and ZYP1 on ltp1 mutants showed that low temperature results in a failure to complete synapsis at pachytene. KASP genotyping revealed that the ltp1 mutant has a 4-Mb deletion in 5DL. Of 41 genes within this deletion region, the strongest candidate for the stabilisation of chromosome pairing at low temperatures is the meiotic recombination gene Dmc1. The ltp1 mutants were subsequently treated at 30 °C for 24 h during meiosis and exhibited a reduced number of crossovers and increased univalence, though to a lesser extent than at 13 °C. We therefore renamed our ltp1 mutant 'ttmei1' (temperature-tolerant meiosis 1) to reflect this additional loss of high temperature tolerance."

"31963591","abstracttext","Chlorophyll biosynthesis plays a vital role in chloroplast development and photosynthesis in plants. In this study, we identified an orthologue of the rice gene TDR ( Oryza sativa L., Tapetum Degeneration Retardation) in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) called TaTDR-Like ( TaTDRL ) by sequence comparison. TaTDRL encodes a putative 557 amino acid protein with a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) conserved domain at the C-terminal (295-344 aa). The TaTDRL protein localised to the nucleus and displayed transcriptional activation activity in a yeast hybrid system. TaTDRL was expressed in the leaf tissue and expression was induced by dark treatment. Here, we revealed the potential function of TaTDRL gene in wheat by utilizing transgenic Arabidopsis plants TaTDRL overexpressing (TaTDRL-OE) and TaTDRL-EAR (EAR-motif, a repression domain of only 12 amino acids). Compared with wild-type plants (WT), both TaTDRL-OE and TaTDRL-EAR were characterized by a deficiency of chlorophyll. Moreover, the expression level of the chlorophyll-related gene AtPORC ( NADPH:protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase C ) in TaTDRL-OE and TaTDRL-EAR was lower than that of WT. We found that TaTDRL physically interacts with wheat Phytochrome Interacting Factor 1 (PIF1) and Arabadopsis PIF1, suggesting that TaTDRL regulates light signaling during dark or light treatment. In summary, TaTDRL may respond to dark or light treatment and negatively regulate chlorophyll biosynthesis by interacting with AtPIF1 in transgenic Arabidopsis ."
"32765563","articletitle","Fusarium Head Blight and Rust Diseases in Soft Red Winter Wheat in the Southeast United States: State of the Art, Challenges and Future Perspective for Breeding."
"32765563","abstracttext","Among the biotic constraints to wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) production, fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum , leaf rust (LR), caused by Puccinia triticina , and stripe rust (SR) caused by Puccinia striiformis are problematic fungal diseases worldwide. Each can significantly reduce grain yield while FHB causes additional food and feed safety concerns due to mycotoxin contamination of grain. Genetic resistance is the most effective and sustainable approach for managing wheat diseases. In the past 20 years, over 500 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring small to moderate effects for the different FHB resistance types have been reported in wheat. Similarly, 79 Lr -genes and more than 200 QTLs and 82 Yr -genes and 140 QTLs have been reported for seedling and adult plant LR and SR resistance, respectively. Most QTLs conferring rust resistance are race-specific generally conforming to a classical gene-for-gene interaction while resistance to FHB exhibits complex polygenic inheritance with several genetic loci contributing to one resistance type. Identification and deployment of additional genes/QTLs associated with FHB and rust resistance can expedite wheat breeding through marker-assisted and/or genomic selection to combine small-effect QTL in the gene pool. LR disease has been present in the southeast United States for decades while SR and FHB have become increasingly problematic in the past 20 years, with FHB arguably due to increased corn acreage in the region. Currently, QTLs on chromosome 1B from Jamestown, 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 2D, 4A, 5A , and 6A from W14, Ning7840, Ernie, Bess, Massey, NC-Neuse, and Truman, and 3B ( Fhb1) from Sumai 3 for FHB resistance, Lr9 , Lr10 , Lr18 , Lr24 , Lr37, LrA2K , and Lr2K38 genes for LR resistance, and Yr17 and YrR61 for SR resistance have been extensively deployed in southeast wheat breeding programs. This review aims to disclose the current status of FHB, LR, and SR diseases, summarize the genetics of resistance and breeding efforts for the deployment of FHB and rust resistance QTL on soft red winter wheat cultivars, and present breeding strategies to achieve sustainable management of these diseases in the southeast US."
"32849852","articletitle","Wheat Disease Resistance Genes and Their Diversification Through Integrated Domain Fusions."
"32849852","abstracttext","Plants are in a constant evolutionary arms race with their pathogens. At the molecular level, the plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat receptors (NLRs) family has coevolved with rapidly evolving pathogen effectors. While many NLRs utilize variable leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) to detect effectors, some have gained integrated domains (IDs) that may be involved in receptor activation or downstream signaling. The major objectives of this project were to identify NLR genes in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) and assess IDs associated with immune signaling (e.g., kinase and transcription factor domains). We identified 2,151 NLR-like genes in wheat, of which 1,298 formed 547 gene clusters. Among the non-toll/interleukin-1 receptor NLR (non-TNL)-like genes, 1,552 encode LRRs, 802 are coiled-coil (CC) domain-encoding (CC-NBS-LRR or CNL) genes, and three encode resistance to powdery mildew 8 (RPW8) domains (RPW8-NBS-LRR or RNL). The expansion of the NLR gene family in wheat is attributable to its origin by recent polyploidy events. Gene clusters were likely formed by tandem duplications, and wheat NLR phylogenetic relationships were similar to those in barley and Aegilops . We also identified wheat NLR-ID fusion proteins as candidates for NLR functional diversification, often as kinase and transcription factor domains. Comparative analyses of the IDs revealed evolutionary conservation of more than 80% amino acid sequence similarity. Homology assessment indicates that these domains originated as functional non-NLR-encoding genes that were incorporated into NLR-encoding genes through duplication events. We also found that many of the NLR-ID genes encode alternative transcripts that include or exclude IDs, a phenomenon that seems to be conserved among species. To verify this, we have analyzed the alternative transcripts that include or exclude an ID of an NLR-ID from another monocotyledon species, rice ( Oryza sativa ). This indicates that plants employ alternative splicing to regulate IDs, possibly using them as baits, decoys, and functional signaling components. Genomic and expression data support the hypothesis that wheat uses alternative splicing to include and exclude IDs from NLR proteins."

"9084219","abstracttext","Pathogenesis-related expression of the two antifungal hydrolases beta-1,3-glucanase (EC 3.2.1.39) and chitinase (EC 3.2.1.14) was studied in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as part of the defence response to stem rust (Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici, Pgt), mediated by the semi-dominantly acting resistance genes Sr5 and Sr24. Complete resistance (infection type 0), mediated by the Sr5 gene in cultivar Pre-Sr5, closely correlates with the hypersensitive response of penetrated cells at early stage of the interaction, when the first haustorium is formed. In contrast, cultivar Pre-Sr24 shows intermediate resistance (infection type 2-3) which is not directly linked to cell death. In both cases, the plant response included a rapid increase in beta-1,3-glucanase activity between 24 and 48 h after inoculation. One main extracellular 30-kDa isform of beta-1,3-glucanase was present in both lines, as shown by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. Two additional minor isoforms (32 and 23 kDa) were detected only in Pre-Sr24, and only at later time points. Increased enzme activity and the appearance of new isoforms in the resistance lines was preceded by accumulation of mRNAs encoding beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinases. However, there were no changes in chitinase activity or isoforms. A high constitutive level of chitinase activity was observed in all wheat genotypes. Serological studies indicated the presence of a class II chitinase of 26 kDa. Accumulation of beta-1,3-glucanase and chitinase transcripts was detected before the pathogen penetrated the leaves through stomata and approximately 16 h before the typical hypersensitive response was observed, indicating that signal(s) for defense gene activation were recognised by the host plant long before a tight contact between the pathogen and a host cell is established. A glycoprotein (Pgt elicitor) derived from hyphal walls, strongly induced beta-1,3-glucanase. We discuss the possible role of the elicitor in the early signalling mediating Sr5- and Sr24-specified resistance in wheat."

"9426280","abstracttext","This paper describes the effects of 5-azacytidine on the condensation state of rye (Secale cereale L.) chromatin introduced into the wheat genome (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Beaver). The wheat cultivar Beaver carries a translocation between the short arm of rye chromosome 1R (1RS) and the long arm of wheat chromosome 1B (1BL/1RS). 1RS can be detected using genomic in situ hybridisation and carries a ribosomal DNA (rDNA) locus that can be simultaneously detected using multiple labelling strategies. The rDNA locus divides 1RS into a distal region that is gene rich and a proximal region that is gene poor and highly methylated. 1RS also carries a large block of subtelomeric heterochromatin. The drug, which acts to inhibit DNA methylation in plants, has three pronounced effects on interphase nuclei. (1) It induces aberrant condensation of the rye subtelomeric heterochromatin and in many cases induces sister chromatid separation in the subtelomeric heterochromatin of G2 nuclei. (2) Nuclei trisomic for 1RS are observed at low frequency in treated material and are probably a consequence of aberrant sister chromatid separation or condensation. (3) The drug alters normal condensation of 1RS euchromatin. However, contrary to expectation the effect is not simply to induce decondensation. The proximal region of the arm actually condenses at low levels of drug administration while the distal region remains unaltered or increases its decondensation state. Increasing the concentration of 5-azacytidine induces a biphasic response and at the highest concentration used all regions of the arm show signs of decondensation. Thus the influence of the drug on chromatin condensation depends on the genomic structure."

"12582483","abstracttext","A set of 24 wheat microsatellite markers, representing at least one marker from each chromosome, was used for the assessment of genetic diversity in 998 accessions of hexaploid bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) which originated from 68 countries of five continents. A total of 470 alleles were detected with an average allele number of 18.1 per locus. The highest number of alleles per locus was detected in the B genome with 19.9, compared to 17.4 and 16.5 for genomes A and D, respectively. The lowest allele number per locus among the seven homoeologous groups was observed in group 4. Greater genetic variation exists in the non-centromeric regions than in the centromeric regions of chromosomes. Allele numbers increased with the repeat number of the microsatellites used and their relative distance from the centromere, and was not dependent on the motif of microsatellites. Gene diversity was correlated with the number of alleles. Gene diversity according to Nei for the 26 microsatellite loci varied from 0.43 to 0.94 with an average of 0.77, and was 0.78, 0.81 and 0.73 for three genomes A, B and D, respectively. Alleles for each locus were present in regular two or three base-pair steps, indicating that the genetic variation during the wheat evolution occurred step by step in a continuous manner. In most cases, allele frequencies showed a normal distribution. Comparative analysis of microsatellite diversity among the eight geographical regions revealed that the accessions from the Near East and the Middle East exhibited more genetic diversity than those from the other regions. Greater diversity was found in Southeast Europe than in North and Southwest Europe. The present study also indicates that microsatellite markers permit the fast and high throughput fingerprinting of large numbers of accessions from a germplasm collection in order to assess genetic diversity."

"12582615","abstracttext","Eighty two new loci, mapped with 51 DNA clones, were added to the earlier deletion maps of the homoeologous group-6 short arms of hexaploid wheat ( Triticum aestivum L. em Thell., 2n = 6 x = 42, AABBDD). There are now 41, 56 and 52 loci mapped on deletion maps of 6AS, 6BS and 6DS, respectively. The linear order of orthologous loci in all three arms appears to be identical. The majority of the loci are located in the distal one-half of the three arms. There seems to be an increased marker/gene density from the centromeric to the telomeric regions in each arm, and the marker density in comparable physical regions is similar on all three maps. Recombination is not uniformly distributed along the chromosome arms; 60% of recombination occurs in the distal one-third of each arm. Recombination increases from the proximal region to the distal end in a nonlinear pattern. The distribution of loci and recombination along each of the three chromosome arms is highly correlated. Comparison of the 6BS deletion map from this study and a 6HS physical map of barley ( Hordeum vulgare L., 2n = 2 x = 14, HH) reveals a remarkably similar distribution of recombinogenic and gene-rich regions between the two chromosome arms, suggesting that the distribution patterns of genes may be conserved in the homoeologous group-6 chromosome short arms of wheat and barley. A consensus map of wheat group-6 short arms containing 46 orthologous loci was constructed. Comparison of the consensus map with published linkage maps of Triticeae group-6 chromosome short arms indicates that the linear order of the loci on the maps has been largely conserved. Evidence from this study does not support the existence of a 2BS-6BS reciprocal terminal translocation."

"15729400","abstracttext","The isolation, physical, and genetic mapping of a group of wheat genes expressed in infected heads of Triticum aestivum 'Frontana' resistant to Fusarium head blight is reported. A cDNA library was built from heads of 'Frontana' through suppressive subtractive hybridization, to enrich for sequences induced by the pathogen Fusarium graminearum during infection. A group of 1794 clones was screened by dot blot hybridization for differential gene expression following infection. Twenty of these clones showed a strong difference in intensity of hybridization between infected and mock-inoculated wheat head samples, suggesting that they corresponded to genes induced during infection. The 20 clones were sequenced and used for mapping analysis. We determined a precise chromosomal location for 14 selected clones by using series of chromosome deletion stocks. It was shown that the 14 clones detected 90 fragments with the use of the restriction enzyme EcoRI; 52 bands were assigned to chromosome bins, whereas 38 fragments could not be assigned. The selected clones were also screened for polymorphisms on a 'Wuhan' x 'Maringa' wheat doubled haploid mapping population. One clone, Ta01_02b03, was related to a quantitative trait locus for type II resistance located on chromosome 2AL, as determined with simple sequence repeat markers on another mapping population, but did not map in the same location on our population. Another clone, Ta01_06f04, was identified by BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) search in public databases to code for a novel beta-1,3-glucanase, homologous to a major pathogenesis-related protein. This clone mapped to chromosomal regions on chromosome 3, including 3BL and 3DL, where B glucanase gene clusters are known to exist. Seven other clones, including 1 coding for an ethylene-response element binding protein and 3 for ribosomal proteins, and 4 clones corresponding to proteins with unknown function, were also mapped."

"18467454","abstracttext","We previously cloned and characterized a novel jacalin-like lectin gene from wheat (Triticum aestivum) plants that responds to infestation by Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) larvae, a major dipteran pest of this crop. The infested resistant plants accumulated higher levels of Hfr-1 (for Hessian fly-responsive gene 1) transcripts compared with uninfested or susceptible plants. Here, we characterize the soluble and active recombinant His(6)-HFR1 protein isolated from Escherichia coli. Functional characterization of the protein using hemagglutination assays revealed lectin activity. Glycan microarray-binding assays indicated strong affinity of His(6)-HFR1 to Manalpha1-6(Manalpha1-3)Man trisaccharide structures. Resistant wheat plants accumulated high levels of HFR1 at the larval feeding sites, as revealed by immunodetection, but the avirulent larvae were deterred from feeding and consumed only small amounts of the lectin. Behavioral studies revealed that avirulent Hessian fly larvae on resistant plants exhibited prolonged searching and writhing behaviors as they unsuccessfully attempted to establish feeding sites. During His(6)-HFR1 feeding bioassays, Drosophila melanogaster larvae experienced significant delays in growth and pupation, while percentage mortality increased with progressively higher concentrations of His(6)-HFR1 in the diet. Thus, HFR1 is an antinutrient to dipteran larvae and may play a significant role in deterring Hessian fly larvae from feeding on resistant wheat plants."

"15340686","abstracttext","Increased expression of the high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) Bx7 is associated with improved dough strength of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flour. Several cultivars and landraces of widely different genetic backgrounds from around the world have now been found to contain this so-called 'over-expressing' allelic form of the Bx7 subunit encoded by Glu-B1al. Using three methods of identification, SDS-PAGE, RP-HPLC and PCR marker analysis, as well as pedigree information, we have traced the distribution and source of this allele from a Uruguayan landrace, Americano 44D, in the mid-nineteenth century. Results are supported by knowledge of the movement of wheat lines with migrants. All cultivars possessing the Glu-B1al allele can be identified by the following attributes: (1) the elution of the By sub-unit peak before the Dx sub-unit peak by RP-HPLC, (2) high expression levels of Bx7 (>39% Mol% Bx), (3) a 43 bp insertion in the matrix-attachment region (MAR) upstream of the gene promoter relative to Bx7 and an 18 bp nucleotide duplication in the coding region of the gene. Evidence is presented indicating that these 18 and 43 bp sequence insertions are not causal for the high expression levels of Bx7 as they were also found to be present in a small number of hexaploid species, including Chinese Spring, and species expressing Glu-B1ak and Glu-B1a alleles. In addition, these sequence inserts were found in different isolates of the tetraploid wheat, T. turgidum, indicating that these insertion/deletion events occurred prior to hexaploidization."

"15004675","abstracttext","TAXI ( Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor) proteins are present in wheat flour and are known to inhibit glycosyl hydrolase family 11 endoxylanases, enzymes which are commonly applied in grain processing. Here, we describe the PCR-based molecular identification of genes encoding endoxylanase inhibitors HVXI and SCXI, the TAXI-like proteins from barley ( Hordeum vulgare) and rye ( Secale cereale) respectively. The HVXI coding sequence encodes a mature protein of 384 amino acids preceded by a 19 amino acid long signal sequence. SCXI-II/III has an open reading frame encoding a signal peptide of 21 amino acids and a mature protein of 375 amino acids. As for TAXI-I, no introns were detected in the untranslated regions and coding sequences identified. These newly identified sequences allowed us to perform a multiple sequence alignment with TAXI-I and similar proteins. Rice TAXI-type proteins clustered together with the cereal endoxylanase inhibitors. Dicotyledonous proteins with sequence similarity to TAXI-I, including the tomato xyloglucan-specific endoglucanase inhibiting protein, formed a different clade. The TAXI-type proteins may hence be part of a superfamily of proteins all involved in plant responses to biotic or abiotic stress and for which a function as glycosyl hydrolase inhibitors can be suggested. The chromosomal localization of the TAXI-I gene identified on wheat chromosome 3B, of the SCXI-II/III gene identified on rye chromosome 6R, and the presence of a cluster of TAXI-like genes on rice chromosome 1, allowed us to assign the location of TAXI-like genes to the wheat-rye translocation area 3BL/6RL characterized by RFLP markers XGlb33 and Xpsr454 and isozyme Est-5. In rice, RFLP marker C1310S corresponds to a TAXI-like protein encoding sequence."

In addition, leaf samples were collected from 24- and 14-day-old plants during the mission that were returned to Earth for analysis. Plants grown under identical light, temperature, relative humidity, photoperiod, CO(2), and planting density were used as ground controls. At the morphological level, there was little difference in the development of cells of wheat under microg conditions. Leaves developed in mug have thinner cross-sectional area than the 1g grown plants. Ultrastructurally, the chloroplasts of microg grown plants were more ovoid than those developed at 1g, and the thylakoid membranes had a trend to greater packing density. No differences were observed in the starch, soluble sugar, or lignin content of the leaves grown in microg or 1g conditions. Furthermore, no differences in gene expression were detected leaf samples collected at microg from 24-day-old leaves, suggesting that the spaceflight environment had minimal impact on wheat metabolism."
"19005085","articletitle","A second mechanism for aluminum resistance in wheat relies on the constitutive efflux of citrate from roots."
"19005085","abstracttext","The first confirmed mechanism for aluminum (Al) resistance in plants is encoded by the wheat (Triticum aestivum) gene, TaALMT1, on chromosome 4DL. TaALMT1 controls the Al-activated efflux of malate from roots, and this mechanism is widespread among Al-resistant genotypes of diverse genetic origins. This study describes a second mechanism for Al resistance in wheat that relies on citrate efflux. Citrate efflux occurred constitutively from the roots of Brazilian cultivars Carazinho, Maringa, Toropi, and Trintecinco. Examination of two populations segregating for this trait showed that citrate efflux was controlled by a single locus. Whole-genome linkage mapping using an F(2) population derived from a cross between Carazinho (citrate efflux) and the cultivar EGA-Burke (no citrate efflux) identified a major locus on chromosome 4BL, Xce(c), which accounts for more than 50% of the phenotypic variation in citrate efflux. Mendelizing the quantitative variation in citrate efflux into qualitative data, the Xce(c) locus was mapped within 6.3 cM of the microsatellite marker Xgwm495 locus. This linkage was validated in a second population of F(2:3) families derived from a cross between Carazinho and the cultivar Egret (no citrate efflux). We show that expression of an expressed sequence tag, belonging to the multidrug and toxin efflux (MATE) gene family, correlates with the citrate efflux phenotype. This study provides genetic and physiological evidence that citrate efflux is a second mechanism for Al resistance in wheat."

"17180378","abstracttext","A genetic study is presented for traits relating to nitrogen use in wheat. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were established for 21 traits relating to growth, yield and leaf nitrogen (N) assimilation during grain fill in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) using a mapping population from the cross Chinese Spring x SQ1. Glutamine synthetase (GS) isozymes and estimated locations of 126 genes were placed on the genetic map. QTLs for flag leaf GS activity, soluble protein, extract colour and fresh weight were found in similar regions implying shared control of leaf metabolism and leaf size. Flag leaf traits were negatively associated with days to anthesis both phenotypically and genetically, demonstrating the complex interactions of metabolism with development. One QTL cluster for GS activity co-localised with a GS2 gene mapped on chromosome 2A, and another with the mapped GSr gene on 4A. QTLs for GS activity were invariably co-localised with those for grain N, with increased activity associated with higher grain N, but with no or negative correlations with grain yield components. Peduncle N was positively correlated, and QTLs co-localised, with grain N and flag leaf N assimilatory traits, suggesting that stem N can be indicative of grain N status in wheat. A major QTL for ear number per plant was identified on chromosome 6B which was negatively co-localised with leaf fresh weight, peduncle N, grain N and grain yield. This locus is involved in processes defining the control of tiller number and consequently assimilate partitioning and deserves further examination."

"16941218","abstracttext","Post-transcriptional processing of primary transcripts can significantly affect both the quantity and the structure of mature mRNAs and the corresponding protein products. It is an important mechanism of gene regulation in animals, yeast and plants. Here we have investigated the interactive networks of pre-mRNA processing factors in the developing grain of wheat (Triticum aestivum), one of the world's major food staples. As a first step we isolated a homologue of the plant specific AtRSZ33 splicing factor, which has been shown to be involved in the early stages of embryo development in Arabidopsis. Real-time PCR showed that the wheat gene, designated TaRSZ38, is expressed mainly in young, developing organs (flowers, root, stem), and expression peaks in immature grain. In situ hybridization and immunodetection revealed preferential abundance of TaRSZ38 in mitotically active tissues of the major storage organ of the grain, the endosperm. The protein encoded by TaRSZ38 was subsequently used as a starting bait in a two-hybrid screen to identify additional factors in grain that are involved in pre-mRNA processing. Most of the identified proteins showed high homology to known splicing factors and splicing related proteins, supporting a role for TaRSZ38 in spliceosome formation and 5' site selection. Several clones were selected as baits in further yeast two-hybrid screens. In total, cDNAs for 16 proteins were isolated. Among these proteins, TaRSZ22, TaSRp30, TaU1-70K, and the large and small subunits of TaU2AF, are wheat homologues of known plant splicing factors. Several, additional proteins are novel for plants and show homology to known pre-mRNA splicing, splicing related and mRNA export factors from yeast and mammals."

"17482472","abstracttext","Sucrose (Suc) can influence the expression of a large number of genes and thereby regulates many metabolic and developmental processes. However, the Suc sensing and the components of the ensuing signaling transduction pathway leading to the regulation of gene expression are not fully understood. We have shown that protein kinases and phosphatases are involved in the Suc induced expression of fructosyltransferase (FT) genes and fructan accumulation by an hexokinase independent pathway in wheat (Triticum aestivum). In the present study, using an RT-PCR based strategy, we have cloned a calcium-dependent protein kinase (TaCDPK1) cDNA that is upregulated during Suc treatment of excised wheat leaves. The deduced amino-acid sequence of CDPK1 has high sequence similarity (>70%) to known CDPKs from both monocots and dicots. Based on sequence homology, TaCDPK1 sequence shows a variable domain preceding a catalytic domain, an autoinhibitory function domain, and a C-terminal calmodulin-domain containing 4 EF-hand calcium-binding motifs, along with a N-myristoylation motif in the N-terminal variable domain. The recombinant Escherichia coli expressed TaCDPK1 was able to phosphorylate histone III-S in a calcium dependent manner in in vitro assays. The TaCDPK1 gene expression, as determined by quantitative RT-PCR, is induced by Suc and this effect is repressed by the inhibitors of the putative components of the Suc signal transduction pathway (calcium, Ser/Thr protein kinases and protein phosphatases). We propose that TaCDPK1 is involved in the Suc induced signaling pathway in wheat leaves."
"17947258","articletitle","Plastidial glutathione reductase from Haynaldia villosa is an enhancer of powdery mildew resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum)."
"17947258","abstracttext","A full-length cDNA (Hv-GR) whose transcript accumulation increased in response to infection by Blumeria graminis DC.f.sp. tritici (Bgt) was isolated from Haynaldia villosa. Southern analysis revealed a single copy of Hv-GR present in H. villosa. This gene encodes a glutathione reductase (GR) with high similarity to chloroplastic GRs from other plant species. Chloroplastic localization of Hv-GR was confirmed by targeting of the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Hv-GR fusion protein to chloroplasts of epidermal guard cells. Following inoculation with Bgt, transcript accumulation of Hv-GR increased in a resistant line of wheat, but no significant change was observed in a susceptible line. In vivo function of Hv-GR in converting oxidized glutathione (GSSG) to the reduced form (GSH) was verified through heterologous expression of Hv-GR in a yeast GR-deficient mutant. As expected, overexpression of this gene resulted in increased resistance of the mutant to H(2)O(2), indicating a critical role for Hv-GR in protecting cells against oxidative stress. Moreover, overexpression of Hv-GR in a susceptible wheat variety, Triticum aestivum cv. Yangmai 158, enhanced resistance to powdery mildew and induced transcript accumulation of other pathogenesis-related genes, PR-1a and PR-5, through increasing the foliar GSH/GSSG ratio. Therefore, we concluded that a high ratio of GSH to GSSG is required for wheat defense against Bgt, and that chloroplastic GR enzymes might serve as a redox mediator for NPR1 activation."

"18024570","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum is a major necrotrophic fungal pathogen of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and a member of the Dothideomycetes, a large fungal taxon that includes many important plant pathogens affecting all major crop plant families. Here, we report the acquisition and initial analysis of a draft genome sequence for this fungus. The assembly comprises 37,164,227 bp of nuclear DNA contained in 107 scaffolds. The circular mitochondrial genome comprises 49,761 bp encoding 46 genes, including four that are intron encoded. The nuclear genome assembly contains 26 classes of repetitive DNA, comprising 4.5% of the genome. Some of the repeats show evidence of repeat-induced point mutations consistent with a frequent sexual cycle. ESTs and gene prediction models support a minimum of 10,762 nuclear genes. Extensive orthology was found between the polyketide synthase family in S. nodorum and Cochliobolus heterostrophus, suggesting an ancient origin and conserved functions for these genes. A striking feature of the gene catalog was the large number of genes predicted to encode secreted proteins; the majority has no meaningful similarity to any other known genes. It is likely that genes for host-specific toxins, in addition to ToxA, will be found among this group. ESTs obtained from axenic mycelium grown on oleate (chosen to mimic early infection) and late-stage lesions sporulating on wheat leaves were obtained. Statistical analysis shows that transcripts encoding proteins involved in protein synthesis and in the production of extracellular proteases, cellulases, and xylanases predominate in the infection library. This suggests that the fungus is dependant on the degradation of wheat macromolecular constituents to provide the carbon skeletons and energy for the synthesis of proteins and other components destined for the developing pycnidiospores."

"21046181","abstracttext","Polyphenol oxidase (PPO) plays a crucial role in browning reactions in fresh and processed fruits and vegetables, as well as products made from cereal grains. Common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has a large genome, representing an interesting system to advance our understanding of plant PPO gene expression, regulation and function. In the present study, we characterized the expression of Ppo-A1, a major PPO gene located on wheat chromosome 2A, using DNA sequencing, semi-quantitative RT-PCR, PPO activity assays and whole-grain staining methods during grain development. The results indicated that the expression of the Ppo-A1b allele was regulated by alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs, resulting from a 191-bp insertion in intron 1 and one C/G SNP in exon 2. Eight mRNA isoforms were identified in developing grains based on alignments between cDNA and genomic DNA sequences. Only the constitutively spliced isoform b encodes a putative full-length PPO protein based on its coding sequence whereas the other seven spliced isoforms, a, c, d, e, f, g and h, have premature termination codons resulting in potential nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. The differences in expression of Ppo-A1a and Ppo-A1b were confirmed by PPO activity assays and whole grain staining, providing direct evidence for the influence of alternative splicing in the coding region of Ppo-A1 on polyphenol oxidase activity in common wheat grains."

"23589517","abstracttext","Stagonospora nodorum is an important wheat (Triticum aestivum) pathogen in many parts of the world, causing major yield losses. It was the first species in the large fungal Dothideomycete class to be genome sequenced. The reference genome sequence (SN15) has been instrumental in the discovery of genes encoding necrotrophic effectors that induce disease symptoms in specific host genotypes. Here we present the genome sequence of two further S. nodorum strains (Sn4 and Sn79) that differ in their effector repertoire from the reference. Sn79 is avirulent on wheat and produces no apparent effectors when infiltrated onto many cultivars and mapping population parents. Sn4 is pathogenic on wheat and has virulences not found in SN15. The new strains, sequenced with short-read Illumina chemistry, are compared with SN15 by a combination of mapping and de novo assembly approaches. Each of the genomes contains a large number of strain-specific genes, many of which have no meaningful similarity to any known gene. Large contiguous sections of the reference genome are absent in the two newly sequenced strains. We refer to these differences as ""sectional gene absences."" The presence of genes in pathogenic strains and absence in Sn79 is added to computationally predicted properties of known proteins to produce a list of likely effector candidates. Transposon insertion was observed in the mitochondrial genomes of virulent strains where the avirulent strain retained the likely ancestral sequence. The study suggests that short-read enabled comparative genomics is an effective way to both identify new S. nodorum effector candidates and to illuminate evolutionary processes in this species."

In silico and structural analyses revealed a total of 55 miRNAs; 48 and 42 miRNAs were found to be present on 5DL and 5DS respectively, of which 35 were common to both chromosome arms, while 13 miRNAs were specific to 5DL and 7 miRNAs were specific to 5DS. In total, 14 of the predicted miRNAs were identified in wheat for the first time. Representation (the copy number of each miRNA) was also found to be higher in 5DL (1,949) compared to 5DS (1,191). Targets were predicted for each miRNA, while expression analysis gave evidence of expression for 6 out of 55 miRNAs. Occurrences of the same miRNAs were also found in Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa genome sequences to identify syntenic miRNA coding sequences. Based on this analysis, two other miRNAs: miR1133 and miR167 were detected in B. distachyon syntenic region of wheat 5DS. Five of the predicted miRNA coding regions (miR6220, miR5070, miR169, miR5085, miR2118) were experimentally verified to be located to the 5D chromosome and three of them : miR2118, miR169 and miR5085, were shown to be 5D specific. Furthermore miR2118 was shown to be expressed in Chinese Spring adult leaves. miRNA genes identified in this study will expand our understanding of gene regulation in bread wheat."

Such trigeneric hybrids could be used to transfer resistance genes for powdery mildew from rye to CM and subsequently to common wheat and to identify (1) the effects of the P genome ofAgropyron on the self-fertility of the hybrids and (2) the differences in genetic background between rye cultivars with marked differences in pollinating habit. The trigeneric hybrids varied widely in morphology and showed a high level of resistance to such diseases as barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), stripe rust, leaf rust, stem rust, and powdery mildew. Selfed and many backcross derivatives were obtained from the trigeneric hybrids. The results indicated that rye cvs 'Wugong 774' and 'AR132' arose from different gene pools and that the P genome ofAgropyron carries gene(s) responsible for chromosome segregation, leading to functional gamete formation and self-fertility of the hybrids. The F2 and BC1 plants could be obtained in two ways - fusion of the unreduced gametes and the assumed apomixis of unreduced female gametes in the trigeneric hybrid plant II-4 - which indicates that this trigeneric hybrid may be a special genetic stock. Chromosome pairing in the trigeneric hybrids and ways of producing wheat/rye and wheat/Agropyron translocations are discussed."

"24963004","abstracttext","Subcellular localisation of SNAREs (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) and their ability to form SNARE complexes are critical for determining the specificity of vesicle fusion. NPSN11, a Novel Plant SNARE (NPSN) gene, has been reported to be involved in the delivery of cell wall precursors to the newly formed cell plate during cytokinesis. However, functions of NPSN genes in plant-pathogen interactions are largely unknown. In this study, we cloned and characterized three NPSN genes (TaNPSN11, TaNPSN12, and TaNPSN13) and three plant defence-related SNARE homologues (TaSYP132, TaSNAP34, and TaMEMB12). TaSYP132 showed a highly specific interaction with TaNPSN11 in both yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays. We hypothesize that this interaction may indicate a partnership in vesicle trafficking. Expressions of the three TaNPSNs and TaSYP132 were differentially induced in wheat leaves when challenged by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). In virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) assays, resistance of wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivar Xingzi9104 to the Pst avirulent race CYR23 was reduced by knocking down TaNPSN11, TaNPSN13 and TaSYP132, but not TaNPSN12, implying diversified functions of these wheat SNARE homologues in prevention of Pst infection and hyphal elongation. Immuno-localization results showed that TaNPSN11 or its structural homologues were mainly distributed in vesicle structures near cell membrane toward Pst hypha. Taken together, our data suggests a role of TaNPSN11 in vesicle-mediated resistance to stripe rust."

"25489021","abstracttext","Increasing fertilizer consumption has led to low fertilizer use efficiency and environmental problems. Identifying nutrient-efficient genes will facilitate the breeding of crops with improved fertilizer use efficiency. This research performed a genome-wide sequence analysis of the A (NFYA), B (NFYB), and C (NFYC) subunits of Nuclear Factor Y (NF-Y) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and further investigated their responses to nitrogen and phosphorus availability in wheat seedlings. Sequence mining together with gene cloning identified 18 NFYAs, 34 NFYBs, and 28 NFYCs. The expression of most NFYAs positively responded to low nitrogen and phosphorus availability. In contrast, microRNA169 negatively responded to low nitrogen and phosphorus availability and degraded NFYAs. Overexpressing TaNFYA-B1, a low-nitrogen- and low-phosphorus-inducible NFYA transcript factor on chromosome 6B, significantly increased both nitrogen and phosphorus uptake and grain yield under differing nitrogen and phosphorus supply levels in a field experiment. The increased nitrogen and phosphorus uptake may have resulted from the fact that that overexpressing TaNFYA-B1 stimulated root development and up-regulated the expression of both nitrate and phosphate transporters in roots. Our results suggest that TaNFYA-B1 plays essential roles in root development and in nitrogen and phosphorus usage in wheat. Furthermore, our results provide new knowledge and valuable gene resources that should be useful in efforts to breed crops targeting high yield with less fertilizer input."

"26218548","abstracttext","Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, an obligate aerial biotrophic fungus, would be one of the most damaging wheat (Triticum aestivum) diseases without the extensive use of conventional fungicides. In our study, the expression levels of some basal defence-related genes were investigated during a compatible interaction in order to evaluate wheat reactions to infection, along with the different stages of the infectious process in planta. As fungal conidia initiated their germination and developed appressorial germ tube (AGT), early defence reactions involved the expression of a lipoxygenase (LOX)- and an oxalate oxidase (OXO)-encoding genes, followed by activations of corresponding LOX (EC 1.13.11.12) and OXO (EC 1.2.3.4) activities, respectively. When penetration of AGT took place, up-regulation of chitinases (CHI) and PR1-encoding genes expression occurred along with an increase of CHI (EC 3.2.1.14) activity. Meanwhile, expression of a phenylalanine ammonia-lyase-encoding gene also took place. Up-regulation of a phospholipase C- and lipid transfer proteins-encoding genes expression occurred during the latest stages of infection. Neither the phi glutathione S-transferase (GST)-encoding gene expression nor the GST (EC 2.5.1.13) activity was modified upon wheat infection by powdery mildew. Whether these defence reactions during such a compatible interaction are markers of immunity or susceptibility, and whether they have the ability to contribute to protection upon modulation of their timing and their intensity by resistance inducers are discussed."
"27788250","articletitle","Loss-of-Function Mutations in Three Homoeologous PHYTOCLOCK 1 Genes in Common Wheat Are Associated with the Extra-Early Flowering Phenotype."
"27788250","abstracttext","Triticum aestivum L. cv 'Chogokuwase' is an extra-early flowering common wheat cultivar that is insensitive to photoperiod conferred by the photoperiod insensitive alleles at the Photoperiod-B1 (Ppd-B1) and Ppd-D1loci, and does not require vernalization for flowering. This reduced vernalization requirement is likely due to the spring habitat allele Vrn-D1 at the VERNALIZATION-D1 locus. Genotypes of the Ppd-1 loci that determine photoperiod sensitivity do not fully explain the insensitivity to photoperiod seen in 'Chogokuwase'. We detected altered expression patterns of clock and clock-output genes including Ppd-1 in 'Chogokuwase' that were similar to those in an einkorn wheat mutant that lacks the clock-gene homologue, wheat PHYTOCLOCK 1 (WPCL1). Presumptive loss-of-function mutations in all WPCL1 homoeologous genes were found in 'Chogokuwase' and 'Geurumil', one of the parental cultivars. Segregation analysis of the two intervarietal F2 populations revealed that all the examined F2 plants that headed as early as 'Chogokuwase' had the loss-of-function wpcl1 alleles at all three homoeoloci. Some F2 plants carrying the wpcl1 alleles at three homoeoloci headed later than 'Chogokuwase', suggesting the presence of other loci influencing heading date. Flowering repressor Vrn-2 was up-regulated in 'Chogokuwase' and 'Geurumil' that had the triple recessive wpcl1 alleles. An elevated transcript abundance of Vrn-2 could explain the observation that 'Geurumil' and some F2 plants carrying the three recessive wpcl1 homeoealleles headed later than 'Chogokuwase'. In spite of the up-regulation of Vrn-2, 'Chogokuwase' may have headed earlier due to unidentified earliness genes. Our observations indicated that loss-of-function mutations in the clock gene wpcl1 are necessary but are not sufficient to explain the extra-early heading of 'Chogokuwase'."

"28066462","abstracttext","Thousand-grain weight (TGW) of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) contributes significantly to grain yield. In the present study, a candidate gene associated with TGW was identified through specific-locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) of DNA bulks of recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from the cross between Jing 411 and Hongmangchun 21. The gene was located on chromosome 7A, designated as TaTGW-7A with a complete genome sequence and an open reading frame (ORF). A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was present in the first exon between two alleles at TaTGW-7A locus, resulting in a Val to Ala substitution, corresponding to a change from higher to lower TGW. Cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) ( TGW7A ) and InDel ( TG9 ) markers were developed to discriminate the two alleles TaTGW-7Aa and TaTGW-7Ab for higher and lower TGW, respectively. A major QTL co-segregating with TaTGW-7A explained 21.7-27.1% of phenotypic variance for TGW in the RIL population across five environments. The association of TaTGW-7A with TGW was further validated in a natural population and Chinese mini-core collections. Quantitative real-time PCR revealed higher transcript levels of TaTGW-7Aa than those of TaTGW-7Ab during grain development. High frequencies of the superior allele TaTGW-7Aa for higher TGW in Chinese mini-core collections (65.0%) and 501 wheat varieties (86.0%) indicated a strong and positive selection of this allele in wheat breeding. The molecular markers TGW7A and TG9 can be used for improvement of TGW in breeding programs."

"29715688","abstracttext","Copper nanoparticles (nCu) are widely used in industry and in daily life, due to their unique physical, chemical, and biological properties. Few studies have focused on nCu phytotoxicity, especially with regard to toxicity mechanisms in crop plants. The present study examined the effect of 15.6 μM nCu exposure on the root morphology, physiology, and gene transcription levels of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a major crop cultivated worldwide. The results obtained were compared with the effects of exposing wheat to an equivalent molar concentration of ionic Cu (Cu 2+ released from CuSO 4 ) and to control plants. The relative growth rate of roots decreased to approximately 60% and the formation of lateral roots was stimulated under nCu exposure, possibly due to the enhancement of nitrogen uptake and accumulation of auxin in lateral roots. The expression of four of the genes involved in the positive regulation of cell proliferation and negative regulation of programmed cell death decreased to 50% in the Cu 2+ treatment compared to that of the control, while only one gene was down-regulated to about half of the control in nCu treatment. This explained the decreased root cell proliferation and higher extent of induced cell death in Cu 2+ - than in nCu-exposed plants. The increased methane dicarboxylic aldehyde accumulation (2.17-fold increase compared with the control) and decreased antioxidant enzyme activities (more than 50% decrease compared with the control) observed in the Cu 2+ treatment in relation to the nCu treatment indicated higher oxidative stress in Cu 2+ - than in nCu-exposed plants. Antioxidant (e.g., proline) synthesis was pronouncedly induced by nCu to scavenge excess reactive oxygen species, alleviating phytotoxicity to wheat exposed to this form of Cu. Overall, oxidative stress and root growth inhibition were the main causes of nCu toxicity."

"31061102","abstracttext","O -GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation are two posttranslational modifications that antagonistically regulate protein function. However, the regulation of and the cross talk between these two protein modifications are poorly understood in plants. Here we investigated the role of O -GlcNAcylation during vernalization, a process whereby prolonged cold exposure promotes flowering in winter wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), and analyzed the dynamic profile of O -GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated proteins in response to vernalization. Altering O -GlcNAc signaling by chemical inhibitors affected the vernalization response, modifying the expression of VRN genes and subsequently affecting flowering transition. Over a vernalization time-course, O -GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated peptides were enriched from winter wheat plumules by Lectin weak affinity chromatography and iTRAQ-TiO2, respectively. Subsequent mass spectrometry and gene ontology term enrichment analysis identified 168 O -GlcNAcylated proteins that are mainly involved in responses to abiotic stimulus and hormones, metabolic processing, and gene expression; and 124 differentially expressed phosphorylated proteins that participate in translation, transcription, and metabolic processing. Of note, 31 vernalization-associated proteins were identified that carried both phosphorylation and O -GlcNAcylation modifications, of which the majority (97%) exhibited the coexisting module and the remainder exhibited the potential competitive module. Among these, TaGRP2 was decorated with dynamic O -GlcNAcylation (S87) and phosphorylation (S152) modifications, and the mutation of S87 and S152 affected the binding of TaGRP2 to the RIP3 motif of TaVRN1 in vitro. Our data suggest that a dynamic network of O -GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation at key pathway nodes regulate the vernalization response and mediate flowering in wheat."

"32300355","abstracttext","Powdery mildew infection of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ), is a destructive disease that threatens yield and quality worldwide. The most effective and preferred means for the control of the disease is to identify broad-spectrum resistance genes for breeding, especially the genes derived from elite cultivars that exhibit desirable agronomic traits. Jimai 23 is a Chinese wheat cultivar with superior agronomic performance, high-quality characteristics, and effective resistance to powdery mildew at all growth stages. Genetic analysis indicated that powdery mildew resistance in Jimai 23 was mediated by a single dominant gene, tentatively designated PmJM23 . Using bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq), a series of markers was developed and used to map PmJM23. PmJM23 was then located at the Pm2 locus on the short arm of chromosome 5D (5DS). Resistance spectrum analysis demonstrated that PmJM23 provided a broad resistance spectrum different from that of the documented Pm2 alleles, indicating that PmJM23 is most likely a new allele of Pm2 . In view of these combined agronomic, quality, and resistance findings, PmJM23 is expected to be a valuable resistance gene in wheat breeding. To efficiently use PmJM23 in breeding, the closely linked markers of PmJM23 were evaluated and confirmed to be applicable for marker-assisted selection (MAS). Using these markers, a series of resistant breeding lines with high resistance and desirable agronomic performance was selected from the crosses involving PmJM23 , resulting in improved powdery mildew resistance of these lines."

Seedlings of the cultivars Cheyenne (Cnn) and Hope showed higher ABA responsiveness and higher levels of Cor (cold-responsive)-Lea (late embryogenesis abundant) gene expression than seedlings of Chinese Spring (CS). The chromosomes involved in the regulation of ABA responsiveness and Cor-Lea expression were identified using chromosome substitution lines, in which a chromosome pair of CS was substituted for the corresponding homologous pair of Cnn or Hope. In the CS-Cnn substitution lines, chromosomes 3A, 5A, 5D and 7A increased the ABA responsiveness of CS. Chromosomes 3A and 5A were also involved in the regulation of Cor-Lea gene expression and stomatal response during leaf dehydration. Substitution of CS chromosomes 3A or 5A with the respective homologous pair from Hope also enhanced ABA responsiveness and Cor-Lea expression. In addition, the factors present on chromosomes 4D and 7B of highly responsive cultivars increased Wrab17 expression but had little or no effect on ABA responsiveness. Cultivar differences in ABA responsiveness appear to be determined by genes present on these specific chromosomes in common wheat."

"30780477","abstracttext","A number of exotic wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes resistant to spot blotch caused by Cochliobolus sativus are being used to improve the resistance of commercial cultivars in the warm regions of South Asia. The objective of the present study was to determine the inheritance of field resistance to spot blotch in two resistant (R) wheat genotypes, 'Chirya.3' and 'Milan/Shanghai #7' (MS#7), which were crossed to a susceptible (S) commercial cultivar, 'BL1473.' The two resistant genotypes also were crossed to determine allelic relationships for resistance between them. Spot blotch severity was recorded on the parents and on F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 progenies. The F 1 plants from the two crosses between susceptible and resistant genotypes had low disease severity like the resistant parents, indicating that resistance in Chirya.3 and MS#7 is conditioned by dominant gene action. The F 2 plants segregated in 3R:1S ratios, and the F 2:3 families showed the ratio of 1R:1S:2S, segregating for R and S, suggesting that resistance in the two resistant parents is conditioned by a single, dominant gene. The F 1 plants from the cross between the two resistant genotypes were resistant, whereas their F 2 progenies segregated in 15R:1S, suggesting that the resistance genes in MS#7 and Chirya.3 are nonallelic. These simply inherited sources of resistance could be useful for improving spot blotch resistance in the warm regions of South Asia and also may offer useful diversity to breeding programs for developing spot-blotch-resistant wheat cultivars in other regions."

"30305371","abstracttext","Fungal pathogens are a major constraint to global crop production; hence, plant genes encoding pathogen resistance are important tools for combating disease. A few resistance genes identified to date provide partial, durable resistance to multiple pathogens and the wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) Lr67 hexose transporter variant (Lr67res) fits into this category. Two amino acids differ between the wild-type and resistant alleles - G144R and V387L. Exome sequence data from 267 barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) landraces and wild accessions was screened and neither of the Lr67res mutations was detected. The barley ortholog of Lr67, HvSTP13, was functionally characterized in yeast as a high affinity hexose transporter. The G144R mutation was introduced into HvSTP13 and abolished Glc uptake, whereas the V387L mutation reduced Glc uptake by ∼ 50%. Glc transport by HvSTP13 heterologously expressed in yeast was reduced when coexpressed with Lr67res Stable transgenic Lr67res barley lines exhibited seedling resistance to the barley-specific pathogens Puccinia hordei and Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei , which cause leaf rust and powdery mildew, respectively. Barley plants expressing Lr67res exhibited early senescence and higher pathogenesis-related ( PR ) gene expression. Unlike previous observations implicating flavonoids in the resistance of transgenic sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor ) expressing Lr34res , another wheat multipathogen resistance gene, barley flavonoids are unlikely to have a role in Lr67res-mediated resistance. Similar to observations made in yeast, Lr67res reduced Glc uptake in planta These results confirm that the pathway by which Lr67res confers resistance to fungal pathogens is conserved between wheat and barley."

The expression profile of the identified genes under abiotic and biotic stress was analyzed using RNA-seq data. Based on expression patterns analysis, we screened many candidate genes involved in plant response to abiotic and biotic stress. Among them, the functional characteristics of TaMYB344 were further studied. TaMYB344 was localized in the nucleus and functioned as a weak transcriptional activator. We demonstrated that TaMYB344-overexpressing transgenic tobacco plants had enhanced tolerance to drought, heat, and high salt stress."

Differential expression analysis indicated that many R2R3-MYBs were involved in abiotic and biotic stress response. We identified a potential candidate gene TaMYB344, overexpression of which in tobacco plants enhanced drought, heat, and salt stress tolerance. These results will provide abundant molecular data for breeding new varieties of wheat in the future."

"24242160","abstracttext","RNA interference (RNAi) describes the ability of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) to inhibit homologous gene expression at the RNA level. Its specificity is sequence-based and depends on the sequence of one strand of the dsRNA corresponding to part or all of a specific gene transcript. In this study we adopted plant-mediated RNAi technology that targets Sitobion avenae (S. avenae) to enable gene silencing in the aphid and to minimize handling of the insects during experiments. S. avenae was selected for this study because it causes serious economic losses to wheat throughout the world. The carboxylesterase (CbE E4) gene in S. avenae was homologously cloned, which increased synthesis of a protein known to be critical to the resistance (tolerance) this species has developed to a wide range of pesticides. A plant RNAi vector was constructed, and transgenic Triticum aestivum (dsCbE1-5 and dsCbE2-2 lines) expressing CbE E4 dsRNA were developed. S. avenae were fed on dsCbE1-5 and dsCbE2-2 lines stably producing the CbE E4 dsRNA. CbE E4 gene expression in S. avenae was reduced by up to 30-60%. The number of aphids raised on dsCbE1-5 and dsCbE2-2 was lower than the number raised on non-transgenic plants. A solution of CbE E4 enzyme from S. avenae fed on dsCbE1-5 and dsCbE2-2 plants hydrolyzed only up to 20-30% Phoxim solution within 40 min whereas a solution of the enzyme from CbE E4 fed on control plants hydrolyzed 60% of Phoxim solution within 40 min. CbE E4 gene silencing was achieved by our wheat-mediated RNAi approach. This plant-mediated RNAi approach for addressing degradation-based pesticide resistance mechanisms in aphids and may prove useful in pest management for diverse agro-ecosystems."
"30727237","articletitle","First Report of Fusarium pseudograminearum Causing Crown Rot of Wheat in Henan, China."
"30727237","abstracttext","Fusarium pseudograminearum (O'Donnell & Aoki), a residue-borne pathogen, is responsible for crown rot of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Since its first detection in Queensland, Australia in 1951, it has been reported in many other countries, but not China (2). In May 2011, a crown rot disease was observed in wheat cv. Aikang 58 in a wheat-maize rotation, irrigable and loam field in Henan Province, China. Diseased wheat plants showed honey brown discoloration in the stem bases and whitehead in some plants, which are symptoms of crown rot with about 70% incidence in a surveyed field (2). The pathogen was isolated from diseased stem base on potato dextrose agar (PDA) after being surface-disinfested with 5% NaClO solution for 2 min. Pure cultures were established on carnation leaf agar (CLA) through a single spore technique and identified by morphological and molecular methods according to protocols described previously (1,3,4). Macroconidia of F. pseudograminearum were formed in abundant sporodochia on CLA cultures grown under the BLB light. Macroconidia were usually five septate (about three to seven) and 27 to 91 × 2.7 to 5.5 μm. Colonies grown on PDA from a single conidium in the dark at 25°C had average radial growth rates of ~4.7 to 9.9 mm per day. Colony pigment on PDA grown under light varied from rose to burgundy, while mycelium ranged from rose to yellow white. Two isolates (WZ-8A and WZ-2B) were selected for molecular identification. The translation elongation factor 1-α gene and rDNA ITS gene were amplified by PCR using the specific primers described previously (4). PCR products were sequenced (GenBank Accession Nos. JN862232 to JN862235). Phylogenic analysis of the sequence indicated that the isolates were identified as F. pseudograminearum. The identification was further confirmed by the F. pseudograminearum species-specific PCR primers (Fp1-1: CGGGGTAGTTTCACATTTCCG and Fp1-2: GAGAATGTGATGACGACAATA) (1). The expected PCR products of 520 bp were produced only in F. pseudograminearum. Isolates WZ-2B and WZ-8A were deposited in the Agriculture Culture Collection of China as ACCC38067 and ACCC 38068, respectively. Pathogenicity tests were conducted by inoculating winter wheat cultivar Wenmai 19 with isolates WZ-8A and WZ-2B through soil inoculation. Inoculum was prepared by growing cultures on sterilized wheat bran and chopped wheat-straw (4:1, v/v) after incubation at 25°C for 2 weeks. This inoculum was added to sterilized soil at 1% by volume and no inoculum was added in control treatment. Five seeds were planted in a 15 cm wide pot in a 20 to 25°C greenhouse, with six replications. Seedling death and crown browning occurred in the inoculated wheat plants after 4 weeks with over 90% incidence, while no symptoms developed in the control plants. The fungus was reisolated from inoculated plants, fulfilling Koch's postulates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. pseudograminearum causing crown rot of wheat in China. Considering Henan is the largest wheat production province in China with over 5 million hectares planting area, and the soil and climate conditions are suitable for this disease, it will be a important pathogen of wheat in Henan in the future.

"27965686","articletitle","Ca 2+ /Cation Antiporters (CaCA): Identification, Characterization and Expression Profiling in Bread Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)."
"27965686","abstracttext","The Ca 2+ /cation antiporters (CaCA) superfamily proteins play vital function in Ca 2+ ion homeostasis, which is an important event during development and defense response. Molecular characterization of these proteins has been performed in certain plants, but they are still not characterized in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat). Herein, we identified 34 TaCaCA superfamily proteins, which were classified into TaCAX, TaCCX, TaNCL, and TaMHX protein families based on their structural organization and evolutionary relation with earlier reported proteins. Since the T. aestivum comprises an allohexaploid genome, TaCaCA genes were derived from each A, B, and D subgenome and homeologous chromosome (HC), except chromosome-group 1. Majority of genes were derived from more than one HCs in each family that were considered as homeologous genes (HGs) due to their high similarity with each other. These HGs showed comparable gene and protein structures in terms of exon/intron organization and domain architecture. Majority of TaCaCA proteins comprised two Na_Ca_ex domains. However, TaNCLs consisted of an additional EF-hand domain with calcium binding motifs. Each TaCaCA protein family consisted of about 10 transmembrane and two α-repeat regions with specifically conserved signature motifs except TaNCL, which had single α-repeat. Variable expression of most of the TaCaCA genes during various developmental stages suggested their specified role in development. However, constitutively high expression of a few genes like TaCAX1-A and TaNCL1-B indicated their role throughout the plant growth and development. The modulated expression of certain genes during biotic (fungal infections) and abiotic stresses (heat, drought, salt) suggested their role in stress response. Majority of TaCCX and TaNCL family genes were found highly affected during various abiotic stresses. However, the role of individual gene needs to be established. The present study unfolded the opportunity for detail functional characterization of TaCaCA proteins and their utilization in future crop improvement programs."

"27716051","abstracttext_background","Starch is a major part of cereal grain. It comprises two glucose polymer fractions, amylose (AM) and amylopectin (AP), that make up about 25 and 75 % of total starch, respectively. The ratio of the two affects processing quality and digestibility of starch-based food products. Digestibility determines nutritional quality, as high amylose starch is considered a resistant or healthy starch (RS type 2) and is highly preferred for preventive measures against obesity and related health conditions. The topic of nutrition security is currently receiving much attention and consumer demand for food products with improved nutritional qualities has increased. In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), variation in amylose content is narrow, hence its limited improvement. Therefore, it is necessary to produce wheat lines or populations showing wide variation in amylose/resistant starch content. In this study, a set of EMS-induced M4 mutant lines showing dynamic variation in amylose/resistant starch content were produced. Furthermore, two diverse mutant lines for amylose content were used to study quantitative expression patterns of 20 starch metabolic pathway genes and to identify candidate genes for amylose biosynthesis."
"27716051","abstracttext_results","A population comprising 101 EMS-induced mutation lines (M4 generation) was produced in a bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) variety. Two methods of amylose measurement in grain starch showed variation in amylose content ranging from ~3 to 76 % in the population. The method of in vitro digestion showed variation in resistant starch content from 1 to 41 %. One-way ANOVA analysis showed significant variation (p < 0.05) in amylose and resistant starch content within the population. A multiple comparison test (Dunnett's test) showed that significant variation in amylose and resistant starch content, with respect to the parent, was observed in about 89 and 38 % of the mutant lines, respectively. Expression pattern analysis of 20 starch metabolic pathway genes in two diverse mutant lines (low and high amylose mutants) showed higher expression of key genes of amylose biosynthesis (GBSSI and their isoforms) in the high amylose mutant line, in comparison to the parent. Higher expression of amylopectin biosynthesis (SBE) was observed in the low amylose mutant lines. An additional six candidate genes showed over-expression (BMY, SPA) and reduced-expression (SSIII, SBEI, SBEIII, ISA3) in the high amylose mutant line, indicating that other starch metabolic genes may also contribute to amylose biosynthesis."
"27716051","abstracttext_conclusion","In this study a set of 101 EMS-induced mutant lines (M4 generation) showing variation in amylose and resistant starch content in seed were produced. This population serves as useful germplasm or pre-breeding material for genome-wide study and improvement of starch-based processing and nutrition quality in wheat. It is also useful for the study of the genetic and molecular basis of amylose/resistant starch variation in wheat. Furthermore, gene expression analysis of 20 starch metabolic genes in the two diverse mutant lines (low and high amylose mutants) indicates that in addition to key genes, several other genes (such as phosphorylases, isoamylases, and pullulanases) may also be involved in contributing to amylose/amylopectin biosynthesis."

"17704940","abstracttext","Homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (called pistillody) has been reported in cytoplasmic substitution (alloplasmic) lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) having the cytoplasm of a wild relative species, Aegilops crassa. Our previous studies indicated that pistillody is caused by alterations of the class B MADS-box gene expression pattern associated with mitochondrial gene(s) in the Ae. crassa cytoplasm. To elucidate the nuclear gene involved in the cross-talk between pistillody-related mitochondrial gene(s) and nuclear homeotic genes, we performed cDNA subtraction analysis using cDNAs derived from young spikes of a pistillody line and a normal line. As a result, we identified a protein kinase gene, WPPK1 (wheat pistillody-related protein kinase 1), which is upregulated in the young spikes of the pistillody line. RT-PCR analysis indicated that WPPK1 is strongly expressed in pistils and pistil-like stamens in the pistillody line, suggesting that it is involved in the formation of pistil-like stamens as well as pistils. The full-length cDNA sequence for WPPK1 showed high similarity with a flowering plant PVPK-1 protein kinase, and phylogenetic analysis indicated that it is a member of AGC group protein kinases. Furthermore, a phosphorylation assay indicated that it has protein kinase activity. In situ hybridization analysis revealed that WPPK1 is expressed in developing pistils and pistil-like stamens as well as in their primordia. These indicate that in the alloplasmic line, WPPK1 plays a role in formation and development of pistil-like stamens."

"21980174","abstracttext","Selective inhibition of gene expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) is widely applied in gene function analyses; however, experiments with ODNs in plants are scarce. In this work, we extend the use of ODNs in different plant species, optimizing the uptake, stability, and efficiency of ODNs with a combination of molecular biological and biophysical techniques to transiently inhibit the gene expression of different chloroplast proteins. We targeted the nucleus-encoded phytoene desaturase (pds) gene, encoding a key enzyme in carotenoid biosynthesis, the chlorophyll a/b-binding (cab) protein genes, and the chloroplast-encoded psbA gene, encoding the D1 protein. For pds and psbA, the in vivo stability of ODNs was increased by phosphorothioate modifications. After infiltration of ODNs into juvenile tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) leaves, we detected a 25% to 35% reduction in mRNA level and an approximately 5% decrease in both carotenoid content and the variable fluorescence of photosystem II. In detached etiolated wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves, after 8 h of greening, the mRNA level, carotenoid content, and variable fluorescence were inhibited up to 75%, 25%, and 20%, respectively. Regarding cab, ODN treatments of etiolated wheat leaves resulted in an up to 59% decrease in the amount of chlorophyll b, a 41% decrease of the maximum chlorophyll fluorescence intensity, the cab mRNA level was reduced to 66%, and the protein level was suppressed up to 85% compared with the control. The psbA mRNA and protein levels in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves were inhibited by up to 85% and 72%, respectively. To exploit the potential of ODNs for photosynthetic genes, we propose molecular design combined with fast, noninvasive techniques to test their functional effects."
"24162347","articletitle","The regulatory role of vernalization in the expression of low-temperature-induced genes in wheat and rye."
"24162347","abstracttext","Low temperature is one of the primary stresses limiting the growth and productivity of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.). Winter cereals low-temperature-acclimate when exposed to temperatures colder than 10°C. However, they gradually lose their ability to tolerate below-freezing temperatures when they are maintained for long periods of time in the optimum range for low-temperature acclimation. The overwinter decline in low-temperature response has been attributed to an inability of cereals to maintain low-temperature-tolerance genes in an up-regulated state once vernalization saturation has been achieved. In the present study, the low-temperature-induced Wcs120 gene family was used to investigate the relationship between low-temperature gene expression and vernalization response at the molecular level in wheat and rye. The level and duration of gene expression determined the degree of low-temperature tolerance, and the vernalization genes were identified as the key factor responsible for the duration of expression of low-temperature-induced genes. Spring-habit cultivars that did not have a vernalization response were unable to maintain low-temperature-induced genes in an up-regulated condition when exposed to 4°C. Consequently, they were unable to achieve the same levels of low-temperature tolerance as winter-habit cultivars. A close association between the point of vernalization saturation and the start of a decline in the Wcs120 gene-family mRNA level and protein accumulation in plants maintained at 4°C indicated that vernalization genes have a regulatory influence over low-temperature gene expression in winter cereals."
"25832748","articletitle","Changes in genome-wide gene expression during allopolyploidization and genome stabilization in hexaploid wheat."
"25832748","abstracttext","Allopolyploidization is an important evolutionary event in plants, but its genome-wide effects are not fully understood. Common wheat, Triticum aestivum (AABBDD), evolved through amphidiploidization between T. turgidum (AABB) and Aegilops tauschii (DD). Here, global gene expression patterns in the seedlings of a synthetic triploid wheat line (ABD), its chromosome-doubled hexaploid (AABBDD) and stable synthetic hexaploid (AABBDD), and the parental lines T. turgidum (AABB) and Ae. tauschii (DD) were compared using an oligo-DNA microarray to identify metabolic pathways affected by the genome conflict that occurs during allopolyploidization and genome stabilization. Characteristic gene expression patterns of non-additively expressed genes were detected in the newly synthesized triploid and hexaploid, and in the stable synthetic hexaploid. Hierarchical clustering of all differentially expressed and non-additively expressed genes revealed that the gene expression patterns of the triploid (ABD) were similar to those of the maternal parent (AABB), and that expression patterns in successive generations arising from self-pollination became closer to that of the pollen parent (DD). The non-additive gene expression profiles markedly differed between the triploid (ABD) and chromosome-doubled hexaploid (AABBDD), as supported by Gene Ontology (GOSlim) analysis. Four hundred and nineteen non-additively expressed genes were commonly detected in all three generations. GOSlim analysis indicated that these non-additively expressed genes were predominantly involved in ""biological pathways"". Notably, four of 11 genes related to sugar metabolism displayed elevated expression throughout allopolyploidization. These may be useful candidates for promoting heterosis and adaptation in plants."
"8278547","articletitle","Differential induction of distinct glutathione-S-transferases of wheat by xenobiotics and by pathogen attack."
"8278547","abstracttext","We have previously characterized a pathogen-induced gene from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that was named GstA1 based on sequence similarities with glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs) of maize (R. Dudler, C. Hertig, G. Rebmann, J. Bull, F. Mauch [1991] Mol Plant Microbe Interact 4: 14-18). We have constructed a full-length GstA1 cDNA by combinatorial polymerase chain reaction and demonstrate by functional expression of the cDNA in Escherichia coli that the GstA1-encoded protein has GST activity. An antiserum raised against a GstA1 fusion protein specifically recognized a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 29 kD on immunoblots of extracts from bacteria expressing the GstA1 cDNA and extracts from wheat inoculated with Erysiphe graminis. The GstA1-encoded protein was named GST29. RNA and immunoblot analysis showed that GstA1 was only weakly expressed in control plants and was specifically induced by pathogen attack and by the GST substrate glutathione, but not by various xenobiotics. In contrast, a structurally and antigenically unrelated GST with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kD that was detected with an antiserum raised against GSTs of maize was expressed at a high basal level. This GST25 and an additional immunoreactive protein named GST26 were strongly induced by cadmium and by the herbicides atrazine, paraquat, and alachlor, but not by pathogen attack. Compared with the pathogen-induced GST29, GST25 and GST26 showed a high affinity toward glutathione-agarose and were much more active toward the model substrate 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. Thus, wheat contains at least two distinct GST classes that are differentially regulated by xenobiotics and by pathogen attack and whose members have different enzymic properties. GST25 and GST26 appear to have a function in xenobiotic metabolism, whereas GST29 is speculated to fulfill a more specific role in defense reactions against pathogens."
"10393240","articletitle","Isolation and characterization of the three Waxy genes encoding the granule-bound starch synthase in hexaploid wheat."
"10393240","abstracttext","Complete genomic DNA sequences of three homoeologous Waxy structural genes, located on the chromosomes 7A, 4A, and 7D in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Chinese Spring), were separately determined and analyzed. Those structural genes in lengths from start to stop codon were 2781bp in Wx-7A, 2794bp in Wx-4A, and 2862bp in Wx-7D, each of which consisted of 11 exons and ten introns. They were closely similar to one another in the nucleotide sequences, with 95.6-96.3% homology in mature protein regions, 88. 7-93.0% in transit-peptide regions, and 70.5-75.2% in the introns. These wheat Waxy genes were GC-rich when compared with standard values for plant genomes reported so far. This was reflected in the extremely high G/C occupation frequency at the third position of the codons in the coding regions. The sequence divergence in the exon regions was mostly due to the substitution of nucleotides, whereas that found in the introns was attributed to substitution, insertion and/or deletion of nucleotides. Only the Wx-4A gene contained a trinucleotide insertion (CAA) in the region encoding the transit peptide. Most of the substitutions observed in the exon regions were categorized as synonymous, and higher sequence similarities (96.5-97. 4%) were conserved at the protein level. The phylogenetic tree obtained in terms of the amino acid sequence variations showed a well-resolved phylogenetic relationship among wheat Waxy genes and those from other plants."
"11368350","articletitle","High temperature stress increases the expression of wheat leaf ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activase protein."
"11368350","abstracttext","The effect of high temperature stress on the expression of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activase was examined in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) leaves, which normally possess 46- and 42-kDa activase forms. Heat stress at 38 degrees C significantly reduced total activase mRNA levels compared to controls, and recovery of activase transcription was only marginal 24 h after alleviating heat stress. In contrast to transcript abundance, immunoblot analysis indicated that heat stress increased the accumulation of the 42-kDa activase and induced a putative 41-kDa form. Heat stress did not affect the amounts of the 46- and 42-kDa activase forms (present as 51- and 45-kDa preproteins) recovered after their immunoprecipitation from in vitro translation products. De novo protein synthesis in vivo in the presence of [35S]Met/Cys showed an increase in the amount of newly synthesized 42-kDa subunit after 4 h of heat stress, and synthesis of the putative 41-kDa activase was apparent. In contrast to activase, heat stress led to a rapid and large reduction in the de novo synthesis of the large and small subunits of Rubisco. Long-term (48-h) heat stress further increased the amounts of de novo synthesized 42- and 41-kDa activase forms. After 24 h of recovery from heat stress, de novo synthesis of the 42-kDa activase returned to control levels, while a small amount of 41-kDa protein was still expressed. Southern analysis suggested the presence of a single activase gene. These results indicate that heat stress alters activase expression, most likely posttranscriptionally, and suggest that the heat-induced expression of the 42- and 41-kDa subunits of wheat leaf Rubisco activase may be related to the maintenance and acclimation of photosynthetic CO2 fixation during high temperature stress in wheat."

"15820667","abstracttext","Jasmonates are distributed throughout higher plants, where they play an important role in the activation of signal transduction pathways in response to wounding and pathogen attack. Jasmonates are known to induce the transcriptional activation of plant defense genes, produce jasmonate-regulated proteins (JRP). One class of 32 kDa JRP (designated as JRP-32 in this paper) is present in the Gramineae family, although the function of these proteins is still unclear. A cDNA was cloned from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and designated as Ta-JA1. Sequence comparison indicated that Ta-JA1 encodes a JRP-32 protein. Ta-JA1 exists as a single-copy gene, but other genes with low sequence similarity to Ta-JA1 may be present in the wheat genome. The expression of Ta-JA1 was confined to stem tissues and barely detected in leaf and root tissues. Western blot analyses demonstrated that the recombinant Ta-JA1 protein cross-reacts with maize beta-glucosidase-aggregating factor (BGAF) antibody. Molecular modeling showed that Ta-JA1 and BGAF have a very similar three-dimensional structure. Protein structure analysis indicated that Ta-JA1 together with some related proteins (maize BGAF, wheat Ver2, WCI-1 and Hfr-1) contain two functional domains: a disease response domain and jacalin-related lectin (JRL) domain. A mannose-binding site was also well conserved in these proteins. The data support the hypothesis that JRP-32 and related proteins from Gramineae form a small protein family related to JRLs. This small protein family may have evolved from mannose-specific jacalin-related lectins (mJRLs) by developing a disease response domain in their N-terminus, which may have broadened the functional role of these proteins to include the plant defense response."

"15682265","abstracttext","A computer script was written in the Perl language to design equal-length long oligonucleotides from DNA sequences. The script allows the user to specify G + C content, melting temperature, self-complementarity, the maximum number of contiguous duplicate bases, whether to start with the first start codon and whether to report reverse complements. Microarrays were fabricated with 95 oligonucleotides (60 mers) representing 41 genes. The microarray was interrogated with cDNA from roots and shoots of two near-isogenic lines and a commercial cultivar of Triticum aestivum L. (hexaploid wheat) challenged with cold temperature, hot temperature, or the biological control bacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens. Self-complementarity of the oligonucleotides was negatively correlated with signal intensity in 23 of 54 arrays (39%; P <0.01). Tyramide signal amplification was essential for signal generation and detection. Genes involved in signal transduction pathways responded similarly following exposure to cold, heat and P. fluorescens, suggesting intersection of the pathways involved in response to these disparate stress factors. Microarray results were corroborated by quantitative real-time PCR in 75% of samples assayed. We conclude that long oligonucleotide microarrays for interrogation with cDNA from hexaploid wheat should be constructed from oligonucleotides having minimal self complementarity that also meet user-specified requirements of length, G + C content and melting temperature; multiple oligonucleotides should be used to represent each gene; and Tyramide signal amplification is useful in wheat oligonucleotide microarray studies."

"14608404","abstracttext","A BAC library of hexaploid wheat was constructed using the spring wheat cultivar Triticum aestivum L. 'Glenlea'. Fresh shoot tissue from 7- to 10-day-old seedlings was used to obtain HMW DNA. The library was constructed using the HindIII site of pIndigoBAC-5 and the BamHI site of pIndigoBAC-5 and pECBAC1. A total of 12 ligations were used to construct the entire library, which contains over 650 000 clones. Ninety-six percent of the clones had inserts. The insert size ranged from 5 to 189 kb with an average of 79 kb. The entire library was gridded onto 24 high-density filters using a 5 x 5 array. A subset of these membranes was hybridized with two intergenic chloroplast probes and the percentage of clones containing chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) was calculated to be 2.2%. The genome coverage was estimated to be 3.1 x haploid genome equivalents, giving a 95.3% probability of identifying a clone corresponding to any wheat DNA sequence. BAC pools were constructed and screened using markers targeting the Glu-B1 locus (1BL), the hardness loci (5AS, 5BS, 5DS), the leaf rust resistance locus Lr1 (5DL), and the major fusarium head blight QTL locus located on 3BS. These markers were either locus-specific amplicons or microsatellites. A total of 49 BAC clones were identified for 14 markers giving an average of 3.5 clones/marker, thereby corroborating the estimated 3.1x genome coverage. An example using the gene encoding the HMW glutenin Bx7 is illustrated."

"15154495","abstracttext","Interactions between biotype E greenbug, Schizaphis graminum (Rondani), and wheat, Triticum aestivum L., were investigated using resistant and susceptible near isogenic lines of the greenbug resistance gene Gb3. In an antixenosis test, the greenbugs preferred susceptible plants to resistant ones when free choice of hosts was allowed. Aphid feeding resulted in quick and severe damage to susceptible plants, which seemed to follow a general pattern spatially and was affected by the position where the greenbugs were initially placed. Symptom of damage in resistant plants resembled senescence. Within-plant distribution of aphids after infestation was clearly different between the two genotypes. Significantly more greenbugs fed on the first (oldest) leaf than on the stem in resistant plants, but this preference was reversed in the susceptible one. After reaching its peak, aphid population on the susceptible plants dropped quickly. All susceptible plants were dead in 10-14 d after infestation due to greenbug feeding. Aphid population dynamics on resistant plants exhibited a multipeak curve. After the first peak, the greenbug population declined slowly. More than 70% of resistant plants were killed 47 d after infestation. Performance of both biotype E and I greenbugs on several Gb3-related wheat germplasm lines were also examined. It seems that the preference-on-stem that was characteristic of biotype E greenbugs on the susceptible plants was aphid biotype- and host genotype-dependent. Results from this study suggested that antixenosis, antibiosis, and tolerance in the resistant plants of wheat might all contribute to resistance against greenbug feeding."

"16369760","abstracttext","Grain yield and associated agronomic traits are important factors in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) improvement. Knowledge regarding the number, genomic location, and effect of quantitative trait loci (QTL) would facilitate marker-assisted selection and the development of cultivars with desirable characteristics. Our objectives were to identify QTLs directly and indirectly affecting grain yield expression. A population of 132 F12 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was derived by single-seed descent from a cross between the Chinese facultative wheat Ning7840 and the US soft red winter wheat Clark. Phenotypic data were collected for 15 yield and other agronomic traits in the RILs and parental lines from three locations in Oklahoma from 2001 to 2003. Twenty-nine linkage groups, consisting of 363 AFLP and 47 SSR markers, were identified. Using composite interval mapping (CIM) analysis, 10, 16, 30, and 14 QTLs were detected for yield, yield components, plant adaptation (shattering and lodging resistance, heading date, and plant height), and spike morphology traits, respectively. The QTL effects ranged from 7 to 23%. Marker alleles from Clark were associated with a positive effect for the majority of QTLs for yield and yield components, but gene dispersion was the rule rather than the exception for this RIL population. Often, QTLs were detected in proximal positions for different traits. Consistent, co-localized QTLs were identified in linkage groups 1AL, 1B, 4B, 5A, 6A, and 7A, and less consistent but unique QTLs were identified on 2BL, 2BS, 2DL, and 6B. Results of this study provide a benchmark for future efforts on QTL identification for yield traits."
"19245861","articletitle","A quantitative portrait of three xylanase inhibiting protein families in different wheat cultivars using 2D-DIGE and multivariate statistical tools."
"19245861","abstracttext","Wheat grains contain three classes of xylanase inhibitors (XIs), i.e. TAXI (Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor), XIP (xylanase inhibiting protein) and TLXI (thaumatin-like xylanase inhibitor). These proteins are involved in plant defence and strongly affect cereal-based processes in which inhibitor-sensitive xylanases are used. This paper reports on the successful use of 2D-DIGE and tandem MS to discriminate XI (iso)forms and measures their qualitative and quantitative variation in six different wheat cultivars. In total, 18 TAXI-, 27 XIP- and 3 TLXI-type XI spots were identified. The multiple members of the large TAXI-gene family make a considerable contribution to the total TAXI population. For XIP-type XIs, XIP-I is expressed as the predominant form, albeit under variable degrees of PTMs. Only one TLXI genetic variant was identified, showing different degrees of glycosylation. Multiple comparison analysis revealed up to 5-fold intercultivar differences in protein level of XI (iso)forms. Evaluation of abundance patterns using multivariate statistical tools revealed highly distinctive as well as correlated levels of different XI forms among the six cultivars. As the constitutive (and induced) levels of the different XI (iso)forms, which are differentially regulated in response to various forms of stress in other wheat plant parts, considerably vary between the cultivars, it can be assumed that their degree of resistance against pathogenic attack differs. Similarities in abundance profiles between XI (iso)forms and pathogenesis-related chitinases are also in line with a role in plant defence."
"17269932","articletitle","TLXI, a novel type of xylanase inhibitor from wheat (Triticum aestivum) belonging to the thaumatin family."
"17269932","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum) contains a previously unknown type of xylanase (EC 3.2.1.8) inhibitor, which is described in the present paper for the first time. Based on its >60% similarity to TLPs (thaumatin-like proteins) and the fact that it contains the Prosite PS00316 thaumatin family signature, it is referred to as TLXI (thaumatin-like xylanase inhibitor). TLXI is a basic (pI> or =9.3 in isoelectric focusing) protein with a molecular mass of approx. 18-kDa (determined by SDS/PAGE) and it occurs in wheat with varying extents of glycosylation. The TLXI gene sequence encodes a 26-amino-acid signal sequence followed by a 151-amino-acid mature protein with a calculated molecular mass of 15.6-kDa and pI of 8.38. The mature TLXI protein was expressed successfully in Pichia pastoris, resulting in a 21-kDa (determined by SDS/PAGE) recombinant protein (rTLXI). Polyclonal antibodies raised against TLXI purified from wheat react with epitopes of rTLXI as well as with those of thaumatin, demonstrating high structural similarity between these three proteins. TLXI has a unique inhibition specificity. It is a non-competitive inhibitor of a number of glycoside hydrolase family 11 xylanases, but it is inactive towards glycoside hydrolase family 10 xylanases. Progress curves show that TLXI is a slow tight-binding inhibitor, with a K(i) of approx. 60-nM. Except for zeamatin, an alpha-amylase/trypsin inhibitor from maize (Zea mays), no other enzyme inhibitor is currently known among the TLPs. TLXI thus represents a novel type of inhibitor within this group of proteins."

"17207258","abstracttext","Understanding the development of the cereal caryopsis holds the future for metabolic engineering in the interests of enhancing global food production. We have developed a Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) data platform to investigate the developing wheat (Triticum aestivum) caryopsis. LongSAGE libraries have been constructed at five time-points post-anthesis to coincide with key processes in caryopsis development. More than 90,000 LongSAGE tags have been sequenced generating 29,261 unique tag sequences across all five libraries. Tag abundance, generated from cumulative tag counts, provides insight into the redundancy and diversity of each library. Annotation of the 500 most abundant tags spanning development highlights the array of functional groups being expressed. The relative frequency of these more abundant transcripts allows quantitative analysis of patterns of expression during grain development. We have identified activities of cellular proliferation/differentiation, the accumulation of storage proteins and starch biosynthesis. The abundance of calcium-dependent protein kinases indicate their importance in signalling across development. Acquisition of a broad array of defence coincides with storage accumulation and is dominated by inhibitors of amylase activity. Differential expression profiles of abundant tags from each library reveal the coordinated expression of genes responsible for the cellular events constituting caryopsis development. This SAGE platform has also provided a resource of novel sequence and expression information including the identification of potentially useful promoter activities. Further investigations into both the abundant and low expressing transcripts will provide greater insight into wheat caryopsis development and assist in wheat improvement programmes."

"18836186","abstracttext","Earliness per se genes are those that regulate flowering time independently of vernalization and photoperiod, and are important for the fine tuning of flowering time and for the wide adaptation of wheat to different environments. The earliness per se locus Eps-A(m)1 was recently mapped within a 0.8 cM interval on chromosome 1A(m)L of diploid wheat Triticum monococcum L., and it was shown that its effect was modulated by temperature. In this study, this precise mapping information was used to characterize the effect of the Eps-A(m)1 region on both duration of different developmental phases and spikelet number. Near isogenic lines (NILs) carrying the Eps-A(m)1-l allele from the cultivated accession DV92 had significantly longer vegetative and spike development phases (P<0.0001) than NILs carrying the Eps-A(m)1-e allele from the wild accession G3116. These differences were paralleled by a significant increase in the number of spikelets per spike, in both greenhouse and field experiments (P<0.0001). Significant interactions between temperature and Eps-A(m)1 alleles were detected for heading time (P<0.0001) but not for spikelet number (P=0.67). Experiments using NILs homozygous for chromosomes with recombination events within the 0.8 cM Eps-A(m)1 region showed that the differences in number of spikelets per spike were linked to the differences in heading time controlled by the Eps-A(m)1 locus. These results indicate that the differences in these two traits are either pleiotropic effects of a single gene or the effect of closely linked genes. A similar effect on spikelet number was detected in the distal region of chromosome 1AL in common wheat (T. aestivum L.)."

"18839129","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) produces glutenin storage proteins in the endosperm. The HMW glutenins confer distinct viscoelastic properties to bread dough. The genetics of HMW glutenin proteins have been extensively studied, and information has accumulated about individual subunits, chromosomal locations and DNA sequences, but little is known about the regulators of the HMW glutenins. This investigation addressed the question of glutenin regulators. Expression of the glutenins was analyzed using QRT-PCR in ditelosomic (dt) Chinese Spring (CS) lines. Primers were designed for each of 4 CS glutenin genes and a control, non-storage protein endosperm-specific gene Agp-L (ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase). Each line represents CS wheat, lacking one chromosome arm. The effect of a missing arm could feasibly cause an increase, decrease or no change in expression. For each HMW glutenin, results indicated there were, on average, 8 chromosome arms with an up-regulatory effect and only one instance of a down-regulatory effect. There were significant correlations between orthologous and paralogous HMW glutenins for effects of chromosome groups B and D. Some or all the glutenin alleles shared regulatory loci on chromosome arms 2BS, 7BS, 4DS, 5DS and 6DS, and Agp-L shared regulatory loci with glutenins on arms 7AS, 7BS, 2DS, 3DS, 4DS and 5DS. These results suggest a few chromosome arms contain putative regulatory genes affecting the expression of conserved cis elements of 4 HMW glutenin and Agp-L genes in CS. Regulation by common genes implies the regulators have diverged little from the common wheat ancestor, and furthermore, some regulation may be shared by endosperm-specific-genes. Significant common regulators have practical implications."

"20013057","abstracttext","Carotene desaturation, an essential step in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, is catalyzed by two carotene desaturases, phytoene desaturase (PDS) and ζ-carotene desaturase (ζ-carotene desaturase, ZDS). Full-length cDNAs designated TaPDS and TaZDS were cloned from wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring) respectively, using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) approach. The cDNA of TaPDS sequence was 2076 bp long, containing a 1731 bp open reading frame (ORF) which deduced protein having 576 amino acid residues with predicted molecular mass of 64.3 kDa and having a putative transit sequence for plastid targeting in the N-terminal region. While the cDNA sequence of TaZDS was 2150 bp long, contained an ORF sequence of 1707 bp, and encoded a putative protein of 568 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 62.5 kDa. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that TaPDS and TaZDS showed high homology with other PDSs and ZDSs in higher plant species, respectively. Moreover, sequences analysis also showed a high degree of conservation among plant PDSs and ZDSs. The deduced TaPDS and TaZDS protein both have the dinucleotide binding domain and conserved regions characteristic of other carotene desaturases. Analysis of the expression pattern of wheat TaPDS and TaZDS in different tissues revealed that the transcripts levels were higher in leaves and flowers petals, followed by in inflorescences, and were nearly absent in the roots and seeds. Southern analysis of genomic DNA indicated that the wheat TaPDS and TaZDS probably belong to a low-copy-number gene family."
"20004107","articletitle","Proteolytic activity and cysteine protease expression in wheat leaves under severe soil drought and recovery."
"20004107","abstracttext","The involvement of acidic proteases in soil drought response of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) at seedling stage in three cultivars differing in water stress tolerance was studied. Withholding irrigation for seven days resulted in severe drought stress corresponding to 60% leaf water deficit. Stressed plants were recovered by providing optimal water supply for 3 days. Reversible changes in leaf pigment and protein content were registered, being least expressed in the drought-resistant cultivar Katya. Protein loss was inversely related to the increase in total proteolytic activity at pH 5 and in aminopeptidase activity at pH 7. Quantitative differences among the cultivars were established only for azocaseinolytic activity (pH 5). The drought-resistant cultivar (Katya) showed relatively little increase in acid protease activity whereas the highest values of this activity were detected in cultivar Pobeda. In-gel staining for cysteine-activated proteases revealed four to five separate activity bands. The upper band, specifically inhibited by E-64, was raised at severe drought. Transcript abundance of two wheat cysteine proteases -Ta.61026 putative thiol protease, and WCP2 peptidase of papain type was analyzed by RT-PCR. Gene expression of the cysteine proteases under study was suppressed in the drought-tolerant cultivar, while in the less resistant ones it remained unchanged or augmented. The results suggest that lower proteolytic activity and decreased expression of certain cysteine protease genes under water deficit during early developmental stage could be regarded as an indicator for drought resistance of winter wheat cultivars."
"21938472","articletitle","A second 'overexpression' allele at the Glu-B1 high-molecular-weight glutenin locus of wheat: sequence characterisation and functional effects."
"21938472","abstracttext","Bread is one of the major constituents of the human diet and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is the most important cereal for bread making. The gluten proteins (glutenins and gliadins) are recognised as important components affecting the processing quality of wheat flour. In this research, we investigated a particular glutenin subunit allele in an Australian cultivar, H45. Based on protein and DNA assays, the Glu-B1 allele of H45 seems to be Glu-B1al, an allele that includes a functional duplication of a gene encoding an x-type high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit, and is thought to increase dough strength through overexpression of that subunit. Yet H45 does not have the dough properties that would be expected if it carries the Glu-B1al allele. After confirming that H45 overexpresses Bx subunits and that it has relatively low un-extractable polymeric protein (an indicator of weak dough), we cloned and sequenced two Bx genes from H45. The sequences of the two genes differ from each other, and they each differ by four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from the sequence that has been reported for the Glu-B1al x-type glutenin genes of the Canadian wheat cultivar Glenlea. One of the SNPs leads to an extra cysteine residue in one of the subunits. The presence of this additional cysteine may explain the dough properties of H45 through effects on cross-linkage within or between glutenin subunits. We propose that the Glu-B1 allele of H45 be designated Glu-B1br, and we present evidence that Glu-B1br is co-inherited with low un-extractable polymeric protein."

"22624876","abstracttext","The aims of the present study were to provide deletion maps for wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) chromosomes 5A and 5B and a detailed genetic map of chromosome 5A enriched with popular microsatellite markers, which could be compared with other existing maps and useful for mapping major genes and quantitative traits loci (QTL). Physical mapping of 165 gSSR and EST-SSR markers was conducted by amplifying each primer pair on Chinese Spring, aneuploid lines, and deletion lines for the homoeologous group 5 chromosomes. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping population that is recombinant for only chromosome 5A was obtained by crossing the wheat cultivar Chinese Spring and the disomic substitution line Chinese Spring-5A dicoccoides and was used to develop a genetic linkage map of chromosome 5A. A total of 67 markers were found polymorphic between the parental lines and were mapped in the RIL population. Sixty-three loci and the Q gene were clustered in three linkage groups ordered at a minimum LOD score of 5, while four loci remained unlinked. The whole genetic 5A chromosome map covered 420.2 cM, distributed among three linkage groups of 189.3, 35.4, and 195.5 cM. The EST sequences located on chromosomes 5A and 5B were used for comparative analysis against Brachypodium distachyon (L.) P. Beauv. and rice ( Oryza sativa L.) genomes to resolve orthologous relationships among the genomes of wheat and the two model species."

"20826947","abstracttext","Plant cysteine protease (CP) genes are induced by abiotic stresses such as drought, yet their functions remain largely unknown. We isolated the full-length cDNA encoding a Triticum aestivum CP gene, designated TaCP, from wheat by the rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) method. Sequence analysis revealed that TaCP contains an open reading frame encoding a protein of 362 amino acids, which is 96% identical to barley cysteine protease HvSF42. The TaCP transcript level in wheat seedlings was upregulated during polyethylene glycol (PEG) stress, with a peak appearing around 12 h after treatment. TaCP expression level increased rapidly with NaCl treatment at 48 h. TaCP responded strongly to low temperature (4 degree C) treatment from 1 h post-treatment and reached a peak of about 40-fold at 72 h. However, it showed only a very slight response to abscisic acid (ABA). More than one copy of TaCP was present in each of the three genomes of hexaploid wheat and its diploid donors. TaCP fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was located in the plasma membrane of onion epidermis cells. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaCP showed stronger drought tolerance and higher CP activity under water-stressed conditions than wild-type Arabidopsis plants. The results suggest that TaCP plays a role in tolerance to water deficit."
"22132219","articletitle","Competitive performance of transgenic wheat resistant to powdery mildew."
"22132219","abstracttext","Genetically modified (GM) plants offer an ideal model system to study the influence of single genes that confer constitutive resistance to pathogens on the ecological behaviour of plants. We used phytometers to study competitive interactions between GM lines of spring wheat Triticum aestivum carrying such genes and control lines. We hypothesized that competitive performance of GM lines would be reduced due to enhanced transgene expression under pathogen levels typically encountered in the field. The transgenes pm3b from wheat (resistance against powdery mildew Blumeria graminis) or chitinase and glucanase genes from barley (resistance against fungi in general) were introduced with the ubiquitin promoter from maize (pm3b and chitinase genes) or the actin promoter from rice (glucanase gene). Phytometers of 15 transgenic and non-transgenic wheat lines were transplanted as seedlings into plots sown with the same 15 lines as competitive environments and subject to two soil nutrient levels. Pm3b lines had reduced mildew incidence compared with control lines. Chitinase and chitinase/glucanase lines showed the same high resistance to mildew as their control in low-nutrient treatment and slightly lower mildew rates than the control in high-nutrient environment. Pm3b lines were weaker competitors than control lines. This resulted in reduced yield and seed number. The Pm3b line with the highest transgene expression had 53.2% lower yield than the control whereas the Pm3b line which segregated in resistance and had higher mildew rates showed only minor costs under competition. The line expressing both chitinase and glucanase genes also showed reduced yield and seed number under competition compared with its control. Our results suggest that single transgenes conferring constitutive resistance to pathogens can have ecological costs and can weaken plant competitiveness even in the presence of the pathogen. The magnitude of these costs appears related to the degree of expression of the transgenes."

"23065282","abstracttext","S-phase kinase-associated protein 1 (SKP1), a core component of the SKP1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, functions as an adaptor protein, connecting cullin and F-box proteins. SKP1 plays crucial roles in cell-cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, flower formation, signal transduction, and many other cellular processes. SKP1-like genes have been largely unstudied in wheat. Here, we isolated six wheat SKP1-like (TaSKP) genes from common wheat (Triticum aestivum) and analyzed the expression patterns of these six genes using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Based on gene expression patterns, we divided the genes into two groups. Our data demonstrated that green fluorescent protein-tagged TaSKP proteins were targeted to the plasma membrane or cytoplasm in plant cells. In a yeast two-hybrid system, all TaSKP proteins interacted with TaCFBD, TaSKP1, and TaSKP5, while TaSKP6 interacted with RA and RLK. A BiFC assay suggested that specific combinations of TaSKP and F-box proteins may influence localization patterns in plant cells. TaSKP1, TaSKP5, and TaSKP6 interacted with TaCullin, while TaSKP2, TaSKP3, and TaSKP4 were not found to interact with TaCullin in the yeast two-hybrid system. This evidence indicated that some TaSKP proteins may have the ability to form SCF complexes. Taken together, these data suggested that TaSKP1, TaSKP5, and TaSKP6 proteins may act as a bridge between various F-box proteins and cullin proteins and that TaSKP genes may be involved in various growth and flower development processes."

The alien addition line 2-1-6-3 was shown to have two P. huashanica chromosomes, with a meiotic configuration of 2n = 44 = 22 II. We tested 55 EST-SSR and 336 EST-STS primer pairs that mapped onto seven different wheat chromosomes using DNA from parents and the P. huashanica addition line. One EST-SSR and nine EST-STS primer pairs indicated that the additional chromosome of P. huashanica belonged to homoeologous group 7, the diagnostic fragments of five EST-STS markers (BE404955, BE591127, BE637663, BF482781 and CD452422) were cloned, sequenced and compared. The results showed that the amplified polymorphic bands of P. huashanica and disomic addition line 2-1-6-3 shared 100% sequence identity, which was designated as the 7Ns disomic addition line. Disomic addition line 2-1-6-3 was evaluated to test the leaf rust resistance of adult stages in the field. We found that one pair of the 7Ns genome chromosomes carried new leaf rust resistance gene(s). Moreover, wheat line 2-1-6-3 had a superior numbers of florets and grains per spike, which were associated with the introgression of the paired P. huashanica chromosomes. These high levels of disease resistance and stable, excellent agronomic traits suggest that this line could be utilized as a novel donor in wheat breeding programs."

"24162229","abstracttext","Starch granule proteins (SGPs) of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were analyzed by two electrophoretic techniques: sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). These analyses identified three kinds of SGPs which were tentatively designated SGP-1, SGP-2 and SGP-3. SDS-PAGE resolved the products of three homoeologous genes for SGP-1 into three protein fractions, SGP-A1, -B1 and -D1. While SDS-PAGE resolved SGP-3 into one fraction, 2D-PAGE separated it into three protein fractions encoded by homoeologous genes Sgp-A3, B3 and -D3. SGP-2 was detected as one protein by SDS-PAGE and was present as one protein on 2D-PAGE. Aneuploid (nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic) analyses in the cultivar Chinese Spring showed that the genes for two SGPs (SGP-1 and -3) were located on the short arms of group-7 chromosomes. The results obtained from deletion lines for chromosome arms 7AS, 7BS and 7DS suggested that the gene order along the arms is 'centromere-Sgp-1-Sgp-3-Wx'. An electrophoretic survey of wheat germ plasm identified a few cultivars lacking one of the proteins SGP-A1, -B1, -D1, SGP-A3 and -B3. The null alleles Sgp-A1b, Sgp-B1b and Sgp-D1b will be useful for the production of a variant wheat lacking SGP-1."

"25713338","abstracttext","Priming refers to a mechanism whereby plants are sensitized to respond faster and/or more strongly to future pathogen attack. Here, we demonstrate that preexposure to the green leaf volatile Z-3-hexenyl acetate (Z-3-HAC) primed wheat (Triticum aestivum) for enhanced defense against subsequent infection with the hemibiotrophic fungus Fusarium graminearum. Bioassays showed that, after priming with Z-3-HAC, wheat ears accumulated up to 40% fewer necrotic spikelets. Furthermore, leaves of seedlings showed significantly smaller necrotic lesions compared with nonprimed plants, coinciding with strongly reduced fungal growth in planta. Additionally, we found that F. graminearum produced more deoxynivalenol, a mycotoxin, in the primed treatment. Expression analysis of salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis genes and exogenous methyl salicylate and methyl jasmonate applications showed that plant defense against F. graminearum is sequentially regulated by SA and JA during the early and later stages of infection, respectively. Interestingly, analysis of the effect of Z-3-HAC pretreatment on SA- and JA-responsive gene expression in hormone-treated and pathogen-inoculated seedlings revealed that Z-3-HAC boosts JA-dependent defenses during the necrotrophic infection stage of F. graminearum but suppresses SA-regulated defense during its biotrophic phase. Together, these findings highlight the importance of temporally separated hormone changes in molding plant health and disease and support a scenario whereby the green leaf volatile Z-3-HAC protects wheat against Fusarium head blight by priming for enhanced JA-dependent defenses during the necrotrophic stages of infection."

"25361582","abstracttext","Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia, Kurdjumov) feeding on susceptible Triticum aestivum L. leads to leaf rolling, chlorosis and plant death - symptoms not present in resistant lines. Although the effects of several D. noxia (Dn) resistance genes are known, none have been isolated or characterized. Wheat varieties expressing different Dn genes exhibit distinct modes of D. noxia resistance, such as antibiosis (Dn1), tolerance (Dn2), and antixenosis (Dn5). However, the mechanism whereby feeding aphids are perceived, and how subsequent transcriptional responses are partitioned into resistance categories, remains unclear. Here we report on downstream events in near-isogenic wheat lines containing different Dn genes after D. noxia biotype SA1 feeding. Transcripts involved in stress, signal transduction, photosynthesis, metabolism and gene regulation were differentially regulated during D. noxia feeding. Expression analyses using RT-qPCR and RNA hybridization, as well as enzyme activity profiling, provide evidence that the timing and intensity of pathways induced are critical in the development of particular modes of resistance. Pathways involved include the generation of kinase signalling cascades that lead to a sustained oxidative burst, and a hypersensitive response that is active during antibiosis. Tolerance is a passive resistance mechanism that acts through repair or de novo synthesis of photosystem proteins. Results further suggest that ethylene-mediated pathways are possibly involved in generating volatile compounds and cell wall fortification during the antixenosic response."

"25658025","abstracttext","The transgenic pollen spread is the main pathway of transgenic plant gene flow. The maximum distance of pollen dispersal (horizontal), the spatial dynamics of pollen movement (vertical), and the patterns of pollen dispersal are important considerations in biosafety assessments of genetically modified crops. To evaluate wheat (Triticum aestivum) pollen dispersal, we measured the pollen suspension velocity and analyzed pollen dispersal patterns under natural conditions in the Huanghuai River wheat-growing region in 2009. The pollen suspension velocity was 0.3-0.4 m/s. The highest pollen densities were detected in the north, northwest, and south of the pollen source. Pollen was dispersed over distances greater than 245 m in the northwest and northeast directions. At the pollen source center, pollen density decreased with increasing vertical height. In the north of the pollen source, the pollen density from 65 m to 225 m showed a wave-mode decrease with increasing height. The horizontal transport of pollen over longer distances fitted polynomial equations. In the north, the pollen density was highest at 45 m from the pollen source, and decreased with increasing distance. In the northwest, the pollen density showed a double-peak trend. In the northeast, pollen density was highest from 45 m to 125 m from the source. Wind speeds greater than the pollen suspension velocity and the duration of continuous gusts were the main factors affecting pollen dispersal. This information will be useful for determining the spatial isolation distances for hybrid seed production and for the commercial production of transgenic wheat."

"26678261","abstracttext","Mutagenesis is a powerful tool used for studying gene function as well as for crop improvement. It is regaining popularity because of the development of effective and cost efficient methods for high-throughput mutation detection. Selection for semi-dwarf phenotype during green revolution has reduced genetic diversity including that for agronomically desirable traits. Most of the available mutant populations in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were developed in post-green revolution cultivars. Besides the identification and isolation of agronomically important alleles in the mutant population of pre-green revolution cultivar, this population can be a vital resource for expanding the genetic diversity for wheat breeding. Here we report an Ethylmethane Sulfonate (EMS) generated mutant population consisting of 4,180 unique mutant plants in a pre-green revolution spring wheat cultivar 'Indian'. Released in early 1900s, 'Indian' is devoid of any known height-reducing mutations. Unique mutations were captured by proceeding with single M2 seed from each of the 4,180 M1 plants. Mutants for various phenotypic traits were identified by detailed phenotyping for altered morphological and agronomic traits on M2 plants in the greenhouse and M3 plants in the field. Of the 86 identified mutants, 75 (87%) were phenotypically stable at the M4 generation. Among the observed phenotypes, variation in plant height was the most frequent followed by the leaf morphology. Several mutant phenotypes including looped peduncle, crooked plant morphology, 'gritty' coleoptiles, looped lower internodes, and burnt leaf tips are not reported in other plant species. Considering the extent and diversity of the observed mutant phenotypes, this population appears to be a useful resource for the forward and reverse genetic studies. This resource is available to the scientific community."

"26971301","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) grains induces hydrolyzing enzymes such as α-amylase, which considerably decreases wheat product quality. PHS occurs when cool and wet weather conditions before harvest break dormancy and induce grain germination. In this study, we used PHS-tolerant varieties, Gifu-komugi (Gifu) and OS38, to characterize the mechanisms of both dormancy breakage and dormancy maintenance at low temperatures. Physiologically mature Gifu grains exhibited dormancy after imbibition at 20°C, but germinated at 15°C. In contrast, OS38 grains remained dormant even at temperatures as low as 5°C. Embryo half-grains cut out from the dormant Gifu grains germinated by imbibition at 20°C, similar to conventional varieties worldwide. However, OS38 embryo half-grains were still dormant. Hormonome and pharmacological analyses suggested that ABA and gibberellin metabolism are important for temperature-dependent dormancy maintenance and breakage. Imbibition at 15°C decreased ABA levels but increased gibberellin levels in embryos of freshly harvested Gifu grains. Additionally, low temperatures induced expression of the ABA catabolism genes,TaABA8' OH1 and TaABA8' OH2, and the gibberellin biosynthesis gene,TaGA3ox2, in the embryos. However, in embryos of freshly harvested OS38 grains, ABA levels were increased while gibberellin levels were suppressed at 15°C. In these dormant embryos, low temperatures induced the TaNCED ABA biosynthesis genes, but suppressed TaABA8' OH2 and TaGA3ox2.These results show that the regulatory mechanism influencing the expression of ABA and gibberellin metabolism genes may be critical for dormancy maintenance and breakage at low temperatures. Our findings should help improve PHS-resistant wheat breeding programs."

"26941830","abstracttext_background","Leaf rust (LR), caused by Puccinia triticina and is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The most sustainable method for controlling rust diseases is deployment of cultivars incorporating adult plant resistance (APR). However, phenotyping breeding populations or germplasm collections for resistance in the field is dependent on weather conditions and limited to once a year. In this study, we explored the ability to phenotype APR to LR under accelerated growth conditions (AGC; i.e. constant light and controlled temperature) using a method that integrates assessment at both seedling and adult growth stages. A panel of 21 spring wheat genotypes, including disease standards carrying known APR genes (i.e. Lr34 and Lr46) were characterised under AGC and in the field."
"26941830","abstracttext_results","Disease response displayed by adult wheat plants grown under AGC (i.e. flag-2 leaf) was highly correlated with field-based measures (R(2) = 0.77). The integrated method is more efficient-requiring less time, space, and labour compared to traditional approaches that perform seedling and adult plant assays separately. Further, this method enables up to seven consecutive adult plant LR assays compared to one in the field."
"26941830","abstracttext_conclusion","The integrated seedling and adult plant phenotyping method reported in this study provides a great tool for identifying APR to LR. Assessing plants at early growth stages can enable selection for desirable gene combinations and crossing of the selected plants in the same plant generation. The method has the potential to be scaled-up for screening large numbers of fixed lines and segregating populations. This strategy would reduce the time required for moving APR genes into adapted germplasm or combining traits in top crosses in breeding programs. This method could accelerate selection for resistance factors effective across diverse climates by conducting successive cycles of screening performed at different temperature regimes."

"27440550","abstracttext","A well-known physiological adaptation process of plants encountering drying soil is to achieve water balance by reducing shoot growth and maintaining or promoting root elongation, but little is known about the molecular basis of this process. This study investigated the role of a drought-up-regulated Triticum aestivum NAC69-1 (TaNAC69-1) in the modulation of root growth in wheat. TaNAC69-1 was predominantly expressed in wheat roots at the early vegetative stage. Overexpression of TaNAC69-1 in wheat roots using OsRSP3 (essentially root-specific) and OsPIP2;3 (root-predominant) promoters resulted in enhanced primary seminal root length and a marked increase in maturity root biomass. Competitive growth analysis under water-limited conditions showed that OsRSP3 promoter-driven TaNAC69-1 transgenic lines produced 32% and 35% more above-ground biomass and grains than wild-type plants, respectively. TaNAC69-1 overexpression in the roots down-regulated the expression of TaSHY2 and TaIAA7, which are from the auxin/IAA (Aux/IAA) transcriptional repressor gene family and are the homologs of negative root growth regulators SHY2/IAA3 and IAA7 in Arabidopsis. The expression of TaSHY2 and TaIAA7 in roots was down-regulated by drought stress and up-regulated by cytokinin treatment, which inhibited root growth. DNA binding and transient expression analyses revealed that TaNAC69-1 bound to the promoters of TaSHY2 and TaIAA7, acted as a transcriptional repressor and repressed the expression of reporter genes driven by the TaSHY2 or TaIAA7 promoter. These data suggest that TaNAC69-1 is a transcriptional repressor of TaSHY2 and TaIAA7 homologous to Arabidopsis negative root growth regulators and is likely to be involved in promoting root elongation in drying soil."

"28491075","abstracttext","Stripe rust or yellow rust (YR), caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici ( Pst ), is one of the most important diseases of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Widespread deployment of resistant cultivars is the best means of achieving durable disease control. The red grain, spring wheat cultivar Napo 63 produced by CIMMYT in the 1960s shows a high level of adult-plant resistance to stripe rust in the field. To elucidate the genetic basis of resistance in this cultivar we evaluated 224 F 2:3 lines and 175 F 2:6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Napo 63 and the Pst -susceptible line Avocet S. The maximum disease severity (MDS) data of F 2:3 lines and the relative area under the disease progress curve (rAUDPC) data of RILs were collected during the 2014-2015 and 2015-2016 wheat growing seasons, respectively. Combined bulked segregant analysis and 90K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays placed 275 of 511 polymorphic SNPs on chromosome 2B. Sixty four KASP markers selected from the 275 SNPs and 76 SSR markers on 2B were used to identify a chromosome region associated with rust response. A major effect QTL, named Qyrnap.nwafu-2BS , was identified by inclusive composite interval mapping and was preliminarily mapped to a 5.46 cM interval flanked by KASP markers 90K-AN34 and 90K-AN36 in chromosome 2BS. Fourteen KASP markers more closely linked to the locus were developed following a 660K SNP array analysis. The QTL region was finally narrowed to a 0.9 cM interval flanked by KASP markers 660K-AN21 and 660K-AN57 in bin region 2BS-1-0.53. The resistance of Napo 63 was stable across all environments, and as a QTL, explained an average 66.1% of the phenotypic variance in MDS of F 2:3 lines and 55.7% of the phenotypic variance in rAUDPC of F 5:6 RILs. The short genetic interval and flanking KASP markers developed in the study will facilitate marker-assisted selection, gene pyramiding, and eventual positional cloning of Qyrnap.nwafu-2BS."

"27625667","abstracttext","Feasible and efficient tissue culture plays an important role in plant genetic engineering. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) immature embryos (IMEs) are preferred for tissue culture to mature embryos (MEs) because IMEs easily generate embryogenic callus, producing large number of plants. The molecular mechanisms of regulation and the biological pathways involved in embryogenic callus formation in wheat remain unclear. Here, microRNAs (miRNAs) potentially involved in embryogenic callus formation and somatic embryogenesis were identified through deep sequencing of small RNAs (sRNAs) and analyzed with bioinformatics tools. Six sRNA libraries derived from calli of IMEs and MEs after 3, 6, or 15 d of culture (DC) were constructed and sequenced. A total of 85 known miRNAs were identified, of which 30, 33, and 18 were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) between the IME and ME libraries at 3, 6, and 15 DC, respectively. Additionally, 171 novel and 41 candidate miRNAs were also identified, of the novel miRNA, 69, 67, and 37 were differentially expressed (P < 0.05) between the two types of libraries at 3, 6, and 15 DC, respectively. The expression patterns of eight known and eight novel miRNAs were validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Gene ontology annotation of differentially expressed miRNA targets provided information regarding the underlying molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components involved in embryogenic callus development. Functional miRNAs, such as miR156, miR164, miR1432, miR398, and miR397, differentially expressed in IMEs and MEs might be related to embryogenic callus formation and somatic embryogenesis. This study suggests that miRNA plays an important role in embryogenic callus formation and somatic embryogenesis in wheat, and our data provide a useful resource for further research."

"27621724","abstracttext","In this study 98 rhizospheric actinomycetes were isolated from different wheat and tomato fields, Punjab, Pakistan. The isolates were characterized morphologically, biochemically, and genetically and were subjected to a comprehensive in vitro screening for various plant growth promoting (PGP) traits. About 30% of the isolates screened were found to be the promising PGP rhizobacteria (PGPRs), which exhibited maximum genetic similarity (up to 98-99%) with different species of the genus Streptomyces by using16S rRNA gene sequencing. The most active indole acetic acid (IAA) producer Streptomyces nobilis WA-3, Streptomyces Kunmingenesis WC-3, and Streptomyces enissocaesilis TA-3 produce 79.5, 79.23, and 69.26 μg/ml IAA respectively at 500 μg/ml L-tryptophan. The highest concentration of soluble phosphate was produced by Streptomyces sp. WA-1 (72.13 mg/100 ml) and S. djakartensis TB-4 (70.36 mg/100 ml). All rhizobacterial isolates were positive for siderophore, ammonia, and hydrogen cyanide production. Strain S. mutabilis WD-3 showed highest concentration of ACC-deaminase (1.9 mmol /l). For in-vivo screening, seed germination, and plant growth experiment were conducted by inoculating wheat (Triticum aestivum) seeds with the six selected isolates. Significant increases in shoot length was observed with S. nobilis WA-3 (65%), increased root length was recorded in case of S. nobilis WA-3 (81%) as compared to water treated control plants. Maximum increases in plant fresh weight were recorded with S. nobilis WA-3 (84%), increased plant dry weight was recorded in case of S. nobilis WA-3 (85%) as compared to water treated control plants. In case of number of leaves, significant increase was recorded with S. nobilis WA-3 (27%) and significant increase in case of number of roots were recorded in case of strain S. nobilis WA-3 (30%) as compared to control plants. Over all the study revealed that these rhizospheric PGP Streptomyces are good candidates to be developed as bioferlizers for growth promotion and yield enhancement in wheat crop and can be exploited for the commercial production of different agro-active compounds."

"28066466","abstracttext","Cereal crop species including bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), barley ( Hordeum vulgare L.), rice ( Oryza sativa L.), and maize ( Zea mays L.) provide the bulk of human nutrition and agricultural products for industrial use. These four cereals are central to meet future demands of food supply for an increasing world population under a changing climate. A prerequisite for cereal crop production is the transition from vegetative to reproductive and grain-filling phases starting with flower initiation, a key developmental switch tightly regulated in all flowering plants. Although studies in the dicotyledonous model plant Arabidopsis thaliana build the foundations of our current understanding of plant phenology genes and regulation, the availability of genome assemblies with high-confidence sequences for rice, maize, and more recently bread wheat and barley, now allow the identification of phenology-associated gene orthologs in monocots. Together with recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies, QTL analysis, mutagenesis, complementation analysis, and RNA interference, many phenology genes have been functionally characterized in cereal crops and conserved as well as functionally divergent genes involved in flowering were found. Epigenetic and other molecular regulatory mechanisms that respond to environmental and endogenous triggers create an enormous plasticity in flowering behavior among cereal crops to ensure flowering is only induced under optimal conditions. In this review, we provide a summary of recent discoveries of flowering time regulators with an emphasis on four cereal crop species (bread wheat, barley, rice, and maize), in particular, crop-specific regulatory mechanisms and genes. In addition, pleiotropic effects on agronomically important traits such as grain yield, impact on adaptation to new growing environments and conditions, genetic sequence-based selection and targeted manipulation of phenology genes, as well as crop growth simulation models for predictive crop breeding, are discussed."

"29868985","abstracttext_key message","Hexaploid wheat is more responsive than tetraploid to the interactive effects of elevated [CO 2 ] and low P in terms of carboxylate efflux, enzyme activity and gene expression (TaPT1 and TaPAP). Availability of mineral nutrients to plants under changing climate has become a serious challenge to food security and economic development. An understanding of how elevated [CO 2 ] influences phosphorus (P) acquisition processes at the whole-plant level would be critical in selecting cultivars as well as to maintain optimum yield in limited-P conditions. Wheat (Triticum aestivum and T. durum) grown hydroponically with sufficient and low P concentration were exposed to elevated and ambient [CO 2 ]. Improved dry matter partitioning towards root resulted in increased root-to-shoot ratio, root length, volume, surface area, root hair length and density at elevated [CO 2 ] with low P. Interaction of low P and [CO 2 ] induced activity of enzymes (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase) in root tissue resulting in twofold increase in carboxylates and acid phosphatase exudation. Physiological absorption capacity of roots showed that plants alter their uptake kinetics by increasing affinity (low K m ) in response to elevated [CO 2 ] under low P supply. Increased relative expression of genes, purple acid phosphatase (TaPAP) and high-affinity Pi transporter (TaPT1) in roots induced by elevated [CO 2 ] and low P supported our physiological observations. Hexaploid wheat (PBW-396) being more responsive to elevated [CO 2 ] at low P supply as compared to tetraploid (PDW-233) necessitates the ploidy effect to be explored further which might be advantageous under changing climate."

"28848509","abstracttext","Bacterial leaf streak caused by Xanthomonas translucens pv. undulosa (Xtu) is an important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) worldwide. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) play determinative roles in many of the plant diseases caused by the different species and pathovars of Xanthomonas , but their role in this disease has not been characterized. ICMP11055 is a highly virulent Xtu strain from Iran. The aim of this study was to better understand genetic diversity of Xtu and to assess the role of TALEs in bacterial leaf streak of wheat by comparing the genome of this strain to the recently completely sequenced genome of a U.S. Xtu strain, and to several other draft X. translucens genomes, and by carrying out mutational analyses of the TALE (tal) genes the Iranian strain might harbor. The ICMP11055 genome, including its repeat-rich tal genes, was completely sequenced using single molecule, real-time technology (Pacific Biosciences). It consists of a single circular chromosome of 4,561,583 bp, containing 3,953 genes. Whole genome alignment with the genome of the United States Xtu strain XT4699 showed two major re-arrangements, nine genomic regions unique to ICMP11055, and one region unique to XT4699. ICMP110055 harbors 26 non-TALE type III effector genes and seven tal genes, compared to 25 and eight for XT4699. The tal genes occur singly or in pairs across five scattered loci. Four are identical to tal genes in XT4699. In addition to common repeat-variable diresidues (RVDs), the tal genes of ICMP11055, like those of XT4699, encode several RVDs rarely observed in Xanthomonas , including KG, NF, Y ∗ , YD, and YK. Insertion and deletion mutagenesis of ICMP11055 tal genes followed by genetic complementation analysis in wheat cv. Chinese Spring revealed that Tal2 and Tal4b of ICMP11055 each contribute individually to the extent of disease caused by this strain. A largely conserved ortholog of tal2 is present in XT4699, but for tal4b , only a gene with partial, fragmented RVD sequence similarity can be found. Our results lay the foundation for identification of important host genes activated by Xtu TALEs as targets for the development of disease resistant varieties."

"28913655","abstracttext_key message","Quantitative trait loci controlling stripe rust resistance were identified in adapted Canadian spring wheat cultivars providing opportunity for breeders to stack loci using marker-assisted breeding. Stripe rust or yellow rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis Westend. f. sp. tritici Erikss., is a devastating disease of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in many regions of the world. The objectives of this research were to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with stripe rust resistance in adapted Canadian spring wheat cultivars that are effective globally, and investigate opportunities for stacking resistance. Doubled haploid (DH) populations from the crosses Vesper/Lillian, Vesper/Stettler, Carberry/Vesper, Stettler/Red Fife and Carberry/AC Cadillac were phenotyped for stripe rust severity and infection response in field nurseries in Canada (Lethbridge and Swift Current), New Zealand (Lincoln), Mexico (Toluca) and Kenya (Njoro), and genotyped with SNP markers. Six QTL for stripe rust resistance in the population of Vesper/Lillian, five in Vesper/Stettler, seven in Stettler/Red Fife, four in Carberry/Vesper and nine in Carberry/AC Cadillac were identified. Lillian contributed stripe rust resistance QTL on chromosomes 4B, 5A, 6B and 7D, AC Cadillac on 2A, 2B, 3B and 5B, Carberry on 1A, 1B, 4A, 4B, 7A and 7D, Stettler on 1A, 2A, 3D, 4A, 5B and 6A, Red Fife on 2D, 3B and 4B, and Vesper on 1B, 2B and 7A. QTL on 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3B, 4A, 4B, 5B, 7A and 7D were observed in multiple parents. The populations are compelling sources of recombination of many stripe rust resistance QTL for stacking disease resistance. Gene pyramiding should be possible with little chance of linkage drag of detrimental genes as the source parents were mostly adapted cultivars widely grown in Canada."
"29717349","articletitle","The release of cytochrome c and the regulation of the programmed cell death progress in the endosperm of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under waterlogging."
"29717349","abstracttext","It has been shown in mammalian systems that the mitochondria can play a key role in the regulation of apoptosis by releasing intermembrane proteins (such as cytochrome c) into the cytosol. Cytochrome c released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm activates proteolytic enzyme cascades, leading to specific nuclear DNA degradation and cell death. This pathway is considered to be one of the important regulatory mechanisms of apoptosis. Previous studies have shown that endosperm cell development in wheat undergoes specialized programmed cell death (PCD) and that waterlogging stress accelerates the PCD process; however, little is known regarding the associated molecular mechanism. In this study, changes in mitochondrial structure, the release of cytochrome c, and gene expression were studied in the endosperm cells of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar ""huamai 8"" during PCD under different waterlogging durations. The results showed that waterlogging aggravated the degradation of mitochondrial structure, increased the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨm), resulting in the advancement of the endosperm PCD process. In situ localization and western blotting of cytochrome c indicated that with the development of the endosperm cell, cytochrome c was gradually released from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, and waterlogging stress led to an advancement and increase in the release of cytochrome c. In addition, waterlogging stress resulted in the increased expression of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) and adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), suggesting that the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) may be involved in endosperm PCD under waterlogging stress. The MPTP inhibitor cyclosporine A effectively suppressed cell death and cytochrome c release during wheat endosperm PCD. Our results indicate that the mitochondria play important roles in the PCD of endosperm cells and that the increase in mitochondrial damage and corresponding release of cytochrome c may be one of the major causes of endosperm PCD advancement under waterlogging."

Here, a panel of 108 spring type bread wheat cultivars was phenotyped for 15 yield and yield related traits for two years (2014/15 and 2015/16) under non-stressed conditions, under high temperature stress, under drought and under a combined high temperature and drought regime. The mean loss in grain yield caused by all stress regimes was 51.33%. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) of yield trait showed significant differences among genotypes environments and their interactions (G×E). All the studied traits had higher heritability values which ranged from 0.35-0.94 under [C], 0.58-0.95 under [D], 0.62-0.93 under [H] and 0.60-0.95 under [HD]. GWAS was performed by using 9,646 informative SNP markers and based on these polymorphic SNPs population structure analysis divided whole germplasm into five major sub-populations. Mixed model association analysis detected 503 marker-trait associations (MTAs) at P ≤0.001 while 329 MTAs crossed FDR ≤ 0.05 for all traits with phenotypic variances (R2) ranged from 24.83% to 12.51%.

Furthermore, candidate genes Psy and Sr25 (TG0040) were also significant in present study, these genes were previously mapped on 7A and 7D. The region on 7D was assiociated with 7DL.7Ag translocation from Lophopyrum carring rust resistance Yr16 and many other genes. Similarly region on chromosome 7A which was associated with Psy gene was linked with grain yellow pigment content QTLs. Favourable alleles controlling grain yield were of vital importance and incorporation of these alleles after validation through marker assisted selection and fine mapping could be helpful in wheat yield improvement stress and non-stress conditions."

Segregated endophytes were screened for their PGP traits, abiotic stresses (heavy metals, salinity, drought, and temperature), and antibiotic sensitivity. A total of 16 endophytic fungi were isolated using the culture-dependent approach from different tissue parts of wheat plants. Based upon their internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA gene sequencing, 15 out of 16 isolates were selected for further analysis. In the contemporary investigation, a number of the tested endophytes exhibited fairly good 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase (ACCD) (0.03±0.011 to 1.43±0.01 µ mol α -KB mg -1 protein hr -1 ), indole acetic acid (IAA) (1.125±0.04 to36.12±0.004 µ gml -1 ), and phosphate solubilizing index (PSI) (2.08±0.03to5.16±0.36) activities. More than 30% isolates gave positive result for siderophore and ammonia tests, whereas all exhibited catalase activity but only 2 (582PDA1 and 582PDA11) produced hydrogen cyanide. Trichoderma strains showed salt, heavy metals, and drought tolerance at high levels and also exhibited resistance to all the tested antibiotics. Strain 582PDA4 was found to be the most temperature (55°C) tolerant isolate. The findings of this study indicated that the microbial endophytes isolated from wheat plants possessing a crucial function to improve plant growth could be utilized as biofertilizers or bioagents to establish a sustainable crop production system."

"31143195","abstracttext","The omega-1,2 gliadins are a group of wheat gluten proteins that contain immunodominant epitopes for celiac disease (CD) and also have been associated with food allergies. To reduce the levels of these proteins in the flour, bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum cv. Butte 86) was genetically transformed with an RNA interference plasmid that targeted a 141 bp region at the 5' end of an omega-1,2 gliadin gene. Flour proteins from two transgenic lines were analyzed in detail by quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and tandem mass spectrometry. In one line, the omega-1,2 gliadins were missing with few other changes in the proteome. In the other line, striking changes in the proteome were observed and nearly all gliadins and low molecular weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) were absent. High molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) increased in this line and those that showed the largest increases had molecular weights slightly less than those in the non-transgenic, possibly due to post-translational processing. In addition, there were increases in non-gluten proteins such as triticins, purinins, globulins, serpins, and alpha-amylase/protease inhibitors. Reactivity of flour proteins with serum IgG and IgA antibodies from a cohort of CD patients was reduced significantly in both transgenic lines. Both mixing time and tolerance were improved in the line without omega-1,2 gliadins while mixing properties were diminished in the line missing most gluten proteins. The data suggest that biotechnology approaches may be used to create wheat lines with reduced immunogenic potential in the context of gluten sensitivity without compromising end-use quality."

"30769426","abstracttext","The occurrence of Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV; genus Tritimovirus) was monitored by testing 91 wheat and barley samples collected from various localities of Slovakia from March to June 2007. Samples were screened by a commercial double-antibody sandwich-ELISA kit (Loewe Biochemica, Sauerlach, Germany). Positive results were obtained from two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) samples from the same locality of western Slovakia. Molecular analysis of both samples was performed by reverse transcription-PCR with WSMV-specific primers (WS-8166F 5' GAGAGCAATACTGCGTGTACG 3' and WS-8909R 5' GCATAATGGCTCGAAGTGATG 3') designed according to available sequences. The expected 750-bp PCR fragment containing the N-terminal and core region of the coat protein gene (from 8166 to 8909 nt based on the Sidney81 isolate, GenBank Accession No AF057533) was obtained from both Slovak isolates. Direct sequencing (GenBank Accession Nos. EU723085 and EU723086) revealed that the two isolates have nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities of 98.3 and 100%, respectively. Except for the highly divergent Mexican isolate (Accession No. AF285170), pairwise comparisons of the Slovak isolates with sequences of other WSMV isolates (1) available in GenBank indicated respective nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities ranging from 87.6 to 98.7% and 95.2 to 100%. The Slovak isolates were most closely related to isolates from Czech Republic, Hungary, and Russia (GenBank Accession Nos. AF454454, AF454456, and AF454459). To our knowledge, this is the first report of the natural occurrence of WSMV in Slovakia. Reference: (1) D. C. Stenger et al. Virology 302:58. 2002."

"32211001","abstracttext","The small heat shock proteins (sHSP) are stress-induced proteins with molecular weights ranging from 12 to 42 kDa that act as molecular chaperones to prevent the irreversible aggregation of denaturing proteins. In this study, we cloned the heat responsive gene TaHSP23.9 from wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) based on TMT-labeled quantitative proteomic analysis in our previous work and examined its function in the response of transgenic Arabidopsis to heat and salt stress. Amino acid alignment and phylogenetic tree analysis showed that TaHSP23.9 contained a typically conserved structure of the alpha-crystallin domain and is closely related to OsHSP23.2 in rice. Transient expression assays demonstrated that TaHSP23.9 is located on the endoplasmic reticulum. Quantitative real-time PCR demonstrated that TaHSP23.9 was expressed much more in filling grains under normal conditions and was significantly upregulated by heat and salt stress. Transgenic Arabidopsis plants that constitutively over-expressed TaHSP23.9 had no visible differences or adverse phenotypes compared with the wild type under normal conditions but exhibited enhanced tolerance to heat and salt stress under stress conditions. In addition, we found that the expression level of TaHSP23.9 was significantly higher in the heat-tolerant wheat varieties than in the heat-sensitive varieties. Our results suggest that TaHSP23.9 may function as a protein chaperone to positively regulate plant responses to heat and salt stress and could be developed as a molecular marker for screening heat-tolerant wheat varieties."
"32153608","articletitle","Single Nucleotide Mutagenesis of the TaCHLI Gene Suppressed Chlorophyll and Fatty Acid Biosynthesis in Common Wheat Seedlings."
"32153608","abstracttext","Wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) is one of the most important crops in the world. Chlorophyll plays a vital role in plant development and crop improvement and further determines the crop productivity to a certain extent. The biosynthesis of chlorophyll remains a complex metabolic process, and fundamental biochemical discoveries have resulted from studies of plant mutants with altered leaf color. In this study, we identified a chlorophyll-deficiency mutant, referred to as chli , from the wheat cultivar Shaannong33 that exhibited an obvious pale-green leaf phenotype at the seedling stage, with significantly decreased accumulation of chlorophyll and its precursors, protoporphyrin IX and Mg-protoporphyrin IX. Interestingly, a higher protoporphyrin IX to Mg-protoporphyrin IX ratio was observed in chli . Lipid biosynthesis in chli leaves and seeds was also affected, with the mutant displaying significantly reduced total lipid content relative to Shaanong33. Genetic analysis indicated that the pale-green leaf phenotype was controlled by a single pair of recessive nuclear genes. Furthermore, sequence alignment revealed a single-nucleotide mutation (G664A) in the gene TraesCS7A01G480700.1, which encodes subunit I of the Mg-chelatase in plants. This single-nucleotide mutation resulted in an amino acid substitution (D221N) in the highly conserved domain of subunit I. As a result, mutant protein Tachli-7A lost the ability to interact with the normal protein TaCHLI-7A, as assessed by yeast two-hybrid assay. Meanwhile, Tachli-7A could not recover the chlorophyll deficiency phenotype of the Arabidopsis thaliana SALK_050029 mutant. Furthermore, we found that in Shaannong33, the protoporphyrin IX to Mg-protoporphyrin IX ratio was growth state-dependent and insensitive to environmental change. Overall, the mutation in Tachli-7A impaired the function of Mg-chelatase and blocked the conversion of protoporphyrin IX to Mg- protoporphyrin IX. Based on our results, the chli mutant represents a potentially useful resource for better understanding chlorophyll and lipid biosynthetic pathways in common wheat."

"32267842","abstracttext","Growing resistant wheat (Triticum aestivum L) varieties is an important strategy for the control of leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks. This study sought to identify the chromosomal location and effects of leaf rust resistance loci in five Canadian spring wheat cultivars. The parents and doubled haploid lines of crosses Carberry/AC Cadillac, Carberry/Vesper, Vesper/Lillian, Vesper/Stettler and Stettler/Red Fife were assessed for leaf rust severity and infection response in field nurseries in Canada near Swift Current, SK from 2013 to 2015, Morden, MB from 2015 to 2017 and Brandon, MB in 2016, and in New Zealand near Lincoln in 2014. The populations were genotyped with the 90K Infinium iSelect assay and quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis was performed. A high density consensus map generated based on 14 doubled haploid populations and integrating SNP and SSR markers was used to compare QTL identified in different populations. AC Cadillac contributed QTL on chromosomes 2A, 3B and 7B (2 loci), Carberry on 1A, 2B (2 loci), 2D, 4B (2 loci), 5A, 6A, 7A and 7D, Lillian on 4A and 7D, Stettler on 2D and 6B, Vesper on 1B, 1D, 2A, 6B and 7B (2 loci), and Red Fife on 7A and 7B. Lillian contributed to a novel locus QLr.spa-4A, and similarly Carberry at QLr.spa-5A. The discovery of novel leaf rust resistance QTL QLr.spa-4A and QLr.spa-5A, and several others in contemporary Canada Western Red Spring wheat varieties is a tremendous addition to our present knowledge of resistance gene deployment in breeding. Carberry demonstrated substantial stacking of genes which could be supplemented with the genes identified in other cultivars with the expectation of increasing efficacy of resistance to leaf rust and longevity with little risk of linkage drag."

"30574161","abstracttext","Multiparent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) populations were recently developed to allow the high-resolution mapping of quantitative traits. We present a genetic linkage map of an elite but highly diverse eight-founder MAGIC population in common wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). Our MAGIC population is composed of 394 F 6:8 recombinant inbred lines lacking significant signatures of population structure. The linkage map included 5435 SNP markers distributed over 2804 loci and spanning 5230 cM. The analysis of population parameters, including genetic structure, kinship, founder probabilities, and linkage disequilibrium and congruency to other maps indicated appropriate construction of both the population and the genetic map. It was shown that eight-founder MAGIC populations exhibit a greater number of loci and higher recombination rates, especially in the pericentromeric regions, compared to four-founder MAGIC, and biparental populations. In addition, our greatly simplified eight-parental MAGIC mating design with an additional eight-way intercross step was found to be equivalent to a MAGIC design with all 210 possible four-way crosses regarding the levels of missing founder assignments and the number of recombination events. Furthermore, the MAGIC population captured 71.7% of the allelic diversity available in the German wheat breeding gene pool. As a proof of principle, we demonstrated the application of the resource for quantitative trait loci mapping analyzing seedling resistance to powdery mildew. As wheat is a crop with many breeding objectives, this resource will allow scientists and breeders to carry out genetic studies for a wide range of breeder-relevant parameters in a single genetic background and reveal possible interactions between traits of economic importance."
"30405643","articletitle","The Photoperiod-Insensitive Allele Ppd-D1a Promotes Earlier Flowering in Rht12 Dwarf Plants of Bread Wheat."
"30405643","abstracttext","The gibberellin-responsive dwarfing gene Rht12 can significantly reduce plant height without changing seedling vigor and substantially increase ear fertility in bread wheat ( Triticum aestivum. L). However, Rht12 delays heading date and anthesis date, hindering the use of Rht12 in wheat improvement. To promote early flowering of the Rht12 dwarf plants, the photoperiod-insensitive allele Ppd-D1a was introduced through a cross between Jinmai47 ( Ppd-D1a ) and Karcagi ( Rht12 ). The results showed that Ppd-D1a can rescue the delaying effect of Rht12 on flowering time and promote earlier flowering by 9.0 days (163.2°Cd) in the Rht12 dwarf plants by shortening the late reproduction phase. Plant height was reduced by Rht12 (43.2%) and Ppd-D1a (10.9%), achieving dwarf plants with higher lodging resistance. Ear fertility, like the grain number per spike, was significantly increased by Rht12 (21.3%), while it was reduced by Ppd-D1a (6.5%). However, thousand kernel weight was significantly reduced by Rht12 (12.9%) but significantly increased by Ppd-D1a (16.9%). Finally, plant yield was increased by 16.4 and 8.2%, and harvest index was increased by 24.9 and 15.4% in the Rht12 dwarf lines and tall lines with Ppd-D1a , respectively. Clearly, there was an additive interaction between Rht12 and Ppd-D1 and the introduction of Ppd-D1a advanced the flowering time and improved the yield traits of Rht12 dwarf plants, suggesting that the combination of Rht12 and Ppd-D1a would be conducive to the successful use of Rht12 in wheat breeding programs."

"30555507","abstracttext","Races belonging to Ug99 lineage of stem rust fungus Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici ( Pgt ) continue to pose a threat to wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) production in various African countries. Growing resistant varieties is the most economical and environmentally friendly control measure. Recombinant inbred line (RIL) populations from the crosses of susceptible parent 'Cacuke' with the resistant parents 'Huhwa' and 'Yaye' were phenotyped for resistance at the seedling stage to Pgt race TTKSK (Ug99) and in adult plants in field trials at Njoro, Kenya for two seasons in 2016. Using the Affymetrix Axiom breeders SNP array, two stem rust resistance genes, temporarily designated as SrH and SrY , were identified and mapped on chromosome arm 2BL through selective genotyping and bulked segregant analysis (BSA), respectively. Kompetitive allele specific polymorphism (KASP) markers and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to saturate chromosome arm 2BL in both RIL populations. SrH mapped between markers cim109 and cim114 at a distance of 0.9 cM proximal, and cim117 at 2.9 cM distal. SrY was flanked by markers cim109 and cim116 at 0.8 cM proximal, and IWB45932 at 1.9 cM distal. Two Ug99-effective stem rust resistance genes derived from bread wheat, Sr9h and Sr28 , have been reported on chromosome arm 2BL. Infection types and map position in Huhwa and Yaye indicated that Sr28 was absent in both the parents. However, susceptible reactions produced by resistant lines from both populations against Sr9h -virulent race TTKSF+ confirmed the presence of a common resistance locus Sr9h in both lines. Test of allelism is required to establish genetic relationships between genes identified in present study and Sr9h . Marker cim117 linked to SrH was genotyped on set of wheat lines with Huhwa in the pedigree and is advised to be used for marker assisted selection for this gene, however, a combination of phenotypic and genotypic assays is desirable for both genes especially for selection of Sr9h in breeding programs."

"30590436","abstracttext","Genome duplication with hybridization, or allopolyploidization, occurs in animals, fungi and plants, and is especially common in crop plants. There is an increasing interest in the study of allopolyploids because of advances in polyploid genome assembly; however, the high level of sequence similarity in duplicated gene copies (homeologs) poses many challenges. Here we compared standard RNA-seq expression quantification approaches used currently for diploid species against subgenome-classification approaches which maps reads to each subgenome separately. We examined mapping error using our previous and new RNA-seq data in which a subgenome is experimentally added (synthetic allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica) or reduced (allohexaploid wheat Triticum aestivum versus extracted allotetraploid) as ground truth. The error rates in the two species were very similar. The standard approaches showed higher error rates (>10% using pseudo-alignment with Kallisto) while subgenome-classification approaches showed much lower error rates (<1% using EAGLE-RC, <2% using HomeoRoq). Although downstream analysis may partly mitigate mapping errors, the difference in methods was substantial in hexaploid wheat, where Kallisto appeared to have systematic differences relative to other methods. Only approximately half of the differentially expressed homeologs detected using Kallisto overlapped with those by any other method in wheat. In general, disagreement in low-expression genes was responsible for most of the discordance between methods, which is consistent with known biases in Kallisto. We also observed that there exist uncertainties in genome sequences and annotation which can affect each method differently. Overall, subgenome-classification approaches tend to perform better than standard approaches with EAGLE-RC having the highest precision."

"31500166","abstracttext","Tillering and spike differentiation are two key events for wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). A study on the transcriptomes and microRNA group profiles of wheat at the two key developmental stages will bring insight into the molecular regulation mechanisms. Guomai 301 is a representative excellent new high yield wheat cultivar in the Henan province in China. The transcriptomes and microRNA (miRNA) groups of tiller primordia (TPs), stem tips (STs), and young spikes (YSs) in Guomai 301 were compared to each other. A total of 1741 tillering specifically expressed and 281 early spikes differentiating specifically expressed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. Six major expression profile clusters of tissue-specific DEGs for the three tissues were classified by gene co-expression analysis using K -means cluster. The ribosome (ko03010), photosynthesis-antenna proteins (ko00196), and plant hormone signal transduction (ko04075) were the main metabolic pathways in TPs, STs, and YSs, respectively. Similarly, 67 TP specifically expressed and 19 YS specifically expressed differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, 65 of them were novel. The roles of 3 well known miRNAs, tae-miR156, tae-miR164, and tae-miR167a, in post-transcriptional regulation were similar to that of other researches. There were 651 significant negative miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs in TPs and YSs, involving 63 differentially expressed miRNAs (fold change > 4) and 416 differentially expressed mRNAs. Among them 12 key known miRNAs and 16 novel miRNAs were further analyzed, and miRNA-mRNA regulatory networks during tillering and early spike differentiating were established."

"31950359","abstracttext_main conclusion","Late-maturity α-amylase (LMA) expression in wheat grains can be induced by either a cool temperature shock close to physiological maturity or continuous cool maximum temperatures during grain development. Late-maturity α-amylase (LMA) is a genetic trait in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) involving the production of α-amylase during grain development, which can result in an unacceptably low Falling Number (FN) in mature grain and consequent grain downgrading. Comparison of the FN test, an α-amylase activity assay and a high pI α-amylase-specific ELISA on the same meal samples gave equivalent results; ELISA was used for further experiments because of its isoform specificity. A cool temperature shock during the middle stages of grain development is known to induce LMA and is used for phenotypic screening. It was determined that a cool temperature treatment of seven days was required to reliably induce LMA. Glasshouse studies performed in summer and winter demonstrated that temperature affected the timing of sensitivity to cool-shock by altering the rate and duration of grain development, but that the sensitive grain developmental stage was unchanged at 35-45% moisture content. Wheat varieties with Rht-B1b or Rht-D1b dwarfing genes responded to a cool-shock only from mid grain filling until physiological maturity, whilst genotypes with Rht8c or without a dwarfing gene expressed LMA in response to a cool-shock during a wider developmental range. A continuous cool maximum temperature regimen (23 °C/15 °C day/night) during grain development also resulted in LMA expression and showed a stronger association with field expression than the cool-shock treatment. These results clarify how genotype, temperature and grain developmental stage determine LMA expression, and allow for the improvement of LMA phenotypic screening methods."
"31907562","articletitle","SNP markers for early identification of high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) in bread wheat."
"31907562","abstracttext_key message","A set of eight SNP markers was developed to facilitate the early selection of HMW-GS alleles in breeding programmes. In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum), the high molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) are the most important determinants of technological quality. Known to be very diverse, HMW-GSs are encoded by the tightly linked genes Glu-1-1 and Glu-1-2. Alleles that improve the quality of dough have been identified. Up to now, sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of grain proteins is the most widely used for their identification. To facilitate the early selection of HMW-GS alleles in breeding programmes, we developed DNA-based molecular markers. For each accession of a core collection (n = 364 lines) representative of worldwide bread wheat diversity, HMW-GSs were characterized by both genotyping and SDS-PAGE. Based on electrophoresis, we observed at least 8, 22 and 9 different alleles at the Glu-A1, Glu-B1 and Glu-D1 loci, respectively, including new variants. We designed a set of 17 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that were representative of the most frequent SDS-PAGE alleles at each locus. At Glu-A1 and Glu-D1, two and three marker-based haplotypes, respectively, captured the diversity of the SDS-PAGE alleles rather well. Discrepancies were found mainly for the Glu-B1 locus. However, statistical tests revealed that two markers at each Glu-B1 gene and their corresponding haplotypes were more significantly associated with the rheological properties of the dough than were the relevant SDS-PAGE alleles. To conclude, this study demonstrates that the SNP markers developed provide additional information on HMW-GS diversity. Two markers at Glu-A1, four at Glu-B1 and two at Glu-D1 constitute a useful toolbox for breeding wheat to improve end-use value."

"33228295","abstracttext","Genetic diversity represents the fundamental key to breeding success, providing the basis for breeders to select varieties with constantly improving yield performance. On the other hand, strong selection during domestication and breeding have eliminated considerable genetic diversity in the breeding pools of major crops, causing erosion of genetic potential for adaptation to emerging challenges like climate change. High-throughput genomic technologies can address this dilemma by providing detailed knowledge to characterize and replenish genetic diversity in breeding programs. In hexaploid bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the staple food for 35% of the world's population, bottlenecks during allopolyploidisation followed by strong artificial selection have considerably narrowed diversity to the extent that yields in many regions appear to be unexpectedly stagnating. In this study, we used a 90,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) wheat genotyping array to assay high-frequency, polymorphic SNP markers in 460 accessions representing different phenological diversity groups from Asian, Australian, European, and North American bread wheat breeding materials. Detailed analysis of subgroup diversity at the chromosome and subgenome scale revealed highly distinct patterns of conserved linkage disequilibrium between different gene pools. The data enable identification of genome regions in most need of rejuvenation with novel diversity and provide a high-resolution molecular basis for genomic-assisted introgression of new variation into chromosome segments surrounding directionally selected metaloci conferring important adaptation and quality traits."
"2668282","articletitle","psbG is not a photosystem two gene but may be an ndh gene."
"2668282","abstracttext","A gene of the chloroplast genome has been designated the psbG gene on the basis that in maize the gene product is a 24-kDa polypeptide of photosystem two (PS2) (Steinmetz, A. A., Castroviejo, M., Sayre, R. T., and Bogorad, L. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 2485-2488). We have located and sequenced the equivalent gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum) and have raised specific antibodies to the gene product following its expression in Escherichia coli as a beta-galactosidase fusion protein. Using these antibodies, we have investigated the location of the gene product in various thylakoid membrane fractions of pea (Pisum sativum). The gene product of apparent molecular mass 27-28 kDa is severely depleted in PS2-enriched membrane preparations and its distribution between stromal and granal regions of the membrane is distinct to that of the psbC gene product which is known to be a core polypeptide of PS2. We therefore conclude that psbG does not code for a component of PS2 but instead suggest that it is present in a novel protein complex of the thylakoid membrane. On the basis of 1) the conserved overlap between psbG and ndhC, a chloroplast gene which shows significant homology to a mitochondrial gene that codes for a subunit of the NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase of mitochondria, and 2) sequence similarity between the psbG gene product and the ndh gene product of E. coli, which codes for a respiratory NADH dehydrogenase, we propose that this ill-defined complex functions as a NADH or NADPH-plastoquinone oxidoreductase."

"23475987","abstracttext","Quantitative phenotypic traits are influenced by genetic and environmental variables as well as the interaction between the two. Underlying genetic × environment interaction is the influence that the surrounding environment exerts on gene expression. Perturbation of gene expression by environmental factors manifests itself in alterations to gene co-expression networks and ultimately in phenotypic plasticity. Comparative gene co-expression networks have been used to uncover biological mechanisms that differentiate tissues or other biological factors. In this study, we have extended consensus and differential Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis to compare the influence of different growing environments on gene co-expression in the mature wheat (Triticum aestivum) embryo. This network approach was combined with mapping of individual gene expression QTL to examine the genetic control of environmentally static and variable gene expression. The approach is useful for gene expression experiments containing multiple environments and allowed for the identification of specific gene co-expression modules responsive to environmental factors. This procedure identified conserved coregulation of gene expression between environments related to basic developmental and cellular functions, including protein localization and catabolism, vesicle composition/trafficking, Golgi transport, and polysaccharide metabolism among others. Environmentally unique modules were found to contain genes with predicted functions in responding to abiotic and biotic environmental variables. These findings represent the first report using consensus and differential Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis to characterize the influence of environment on coordinated transcriptional regulation."

"16024691","abstracttext","Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is an important tool for the analysis of gene function in plants. In VIGS, viruses engineered to carry sequences derived from plant gene transcripts activate the host's sequence-specific RNA degradation system. This mechanism targets the RNAs of the viral genome for degradation, and as the virus contains transcribed plant sequence, homologous host mRNAs are also targeted for destruction. While routinely used in some dicots, no VIGS system was known for monocot plants until the recent report of silencing in barley (Hordeum vulgare) by barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV). Here, we report development of protocols for use of BSMV to efficiently silence genes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum). The VIGS system was first optimized in studies silencing phytoene desaturase expression. Next, we used it to assay genes functioning in leaf rust resistance mediated by Lr21, which encodes a nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat class resistance gene product. We demonstrated that infection with BSMV constructs carrying a 150-bp fragment of Lr21 caused conversion of incompatible interactions to compatible, whereas infection with a control construct or one that silences phytoene desaturase had no effect on resistance or susceptibility. Additionally, silencing the RAR1, SGT1, and HSP90 genes, known to be required in many but not all nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat resistance pathways in diverse plant species, resulted in conversion to compatibility, indicating that these genes are essential in Lr21-mediated resistance. These studies indicate that BSMV-VIGS is a powerful tool for dissecting the genetic pathways of disease resistance in hexaploid wheat."

Qfhs.ndsu-3BS) was fine mapped on the distal segment of chromosome 3BS of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a Mendelian factor. FHB resistant parents, Sumai 3 and Nyubai, were used as sources of this gene. Two mapping populations were developed to facilitate segregation of Qfhs.ndsu-3BS in either a fixed resistant (Sumai 3*5/Thatcher) (S/T) or fixed susceptible (HC374/3*98B69-L47) (HC/98) genetic background (HC374 = Wuhan1/Nyubai) for Type II resistance. Type II resistance (disease spread within the spike) was phenotyped in the greenhouse using single floret injections with a mixture of macro-conidia of three virulent strains of Fusarium graminearum. Due to the limited heterogeneity in the genetic background of the crosses and based on the spread of infection, fixed recombinants in the interval between molecular markers XGWM533 and XGWM493 on 3BS could be assigned to discrete ""resistant"" and ""susceptible"" classes. The phenotypic distribution was bimodal with progeny clearly resembling either the resistant or susceptible parent. Marker order for the two maps was identical with the exception of marker STS-3BS 142, which was not polymorphic in the HC/98 population. The major gene Fhb1 was successfully fine mapped on chromosome 3BS in the same location in the two populations within a 1.27-cM interval (S/T) and a 6.05-cM interval (HC/98). Fine mapping of Fhb1 in wheat provides tightly linked markers that can reduce linkage drag associated with marker-assisted selection of Fhb1 and assist in the isolation, sequencing and functional identification of the underlying resistance gene."

"16845527","abstracttext","Puroindolines form the molecular basis of wheat grain hardness. However, little is known about puroindoline gene regulation. We previously reported that the Triticum aestivum puroindoline-b gene (PinB) promoter directs beta-glucuronidase gene (uidA) seed-specific expression in transgenic rice. In this study, we isolated a puroindoline-a gene (PinA), analyzed PinA promoter activity by 5' deletions and compared PinA and PinB promoters in transgenic rice. Seeds of PinA-1214 and PinB-1063 transgenic plants strongly expressed uidA in endosperm, in the aleurone layer and in epidermis cells in a developmentally regulated manner. The GUS activity was also observed in PinA-1214 embryos. Whereas the PinB promoter is seed specific, the PinA promoter also directed, but to a lower level, uidA expression in roots of seedlings and in the vascular tissues of palea and pollen grains of dehiscent anthers during flower development. In addition, the PinA promoter was induced by wounding and by Magnaporthe grisea. By deletion analysis, we showed that the ""390-bp"" PinA promoter drives the same expression pattern as the ""1214-bp"" promoter. Moreover, the ""214-bp"" PinA promoter drives uidA expression solely in pollen grains of dehiscent anthers. The presence of putative cis-regulatory elements that may be related to PinA expression is discussed from an evolutionary point of view. By electrophoretic mobility shift assay, we showed that putative cis-elements (WUN-box, TCA motifs and as-1-like binding sites) whose presence in the PinA promoter may be related to wounding and/or the pathogen response form complexes with nuclear extracts isolated from wounded wheat leaves."
"18794174","articletitle","orf260cra, a novel mitochondrial gene, is associated with the homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (pistillody) in alloplasmic wheat."
"18794174","abstracttext","Homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (pistillody) can occur in cytoplasmic substitution (alloplasmic) lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) that have the cytoplasm of the related species, Aegilops crassa. Previously we showed that pistillody results from altered patterns of expression of class B MADS-box genes mediated by mitochondrial gene(s) in the Ae. crassa cytoplasm. The wheat cultivar Chinese Spring does not show pistillody when Ae. crassa cytoplasm is introduced. The absence of an effect is due to a single dominant gene (designated Rfd1) located on the long arm of chromosome 7B. To identify the mitochondrial gene involved in pistillody induction, we performed a subtraction analysis using cDNAs derived from young spikes of a pistillody line and a normal line. We found that mitochondrial cDNA clone R04 was abundant in the young spikes of the pistillody line but was down-regulated in the normal line that carried nuclear Rfd1. Sequencing of the full-length cDNA corresponding to clone R04 showed that two genes were present, cox I (cytochrome c oxidase subunit I) and orf260(cra). orf260(cra) shows high sequence similarity to orf256, the T. timopheevii mitochondrial gene responsible for cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS). orf260(cra) was also present in the cytoplasms of Ae. juvenalis and Ae. vavilovii, which induce pistillody, but not in the cytoplasms of other species not associated with pistillody. Furthermore, Western blot analysis revealed that the ORF260cra protein was more abundant in the pistillody line than in the normal line. We suggest therefore that orf260(cra) is associated with pistillody induction."

"18500653","abstracttext","Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with epistatic and QTL x environment (QE) interaction for heading date were studied using a doubled haploid (DH) population containing 168 progeny lines derived from a cross between two elite Chinese wheat cultivars Huapei 3 x Yumai 57 (Triticum aestivum L.). A genetic map was constructed based on 305 marker loci, consisting of 283 SSR loci and 22 EST-SSR markers, which covered a total length of 2141.7 cM with an average distance of 7.02 cM between adjacent markers in the genome. QTL analyses were performed using a mixed linear model approach. Two main-effect QTLs and two pairs of digenic epistatic effects were detected for heading date on chromosomes 1B, 2B, 5D, 6D, 7A, and 7D at three different environments in 2005 and 2006 cropping seasons. A highly significant QTL with an F-value 148.96, designated as Qhd5D, was observed within the Xbarc320-Xwmc215 interval on chromosome 5DL, accounting for 53.19% of the phenotypic variance and reducing days-to-heading by 2.77 days. The Qhd5D closely links with a PCR marker Xwmc215 with the genetic distance 2.1 cM, which can be used in molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding programs. Moreover, the Qhd5D was located on the similar position of well-characterised vernalization sensitivity gene Vrn-D1. We are also spending more efforts to develop near-isogenic lines to finely map the Qhd5D and clone the gene Vrn-D1 through map-based cloning. The Qhd1B with additive effect on heading date has not been reported in previous linkage mapping studies, which might be a photoperiod-sensitive gene homoeologous to the Ppd-H2 gene on chromosome 1B. No main-effect QTLs for heading date were involved in epistatic effects."
"20018590","articletitle","Increasing sucrose uptake capacity of wheat grains stimulates storage protein synthesis."
"20018590","abstracttext","Increasing grain sink strength by improving assimilate uptake capacity could be a promising approach toward getting higher yield. The barley (Hordeum vulgare) sucrose transporter HvSUT1 (SUT) was expressed under control of the endosperm-specific Hordein B1 promoter (HO). Compared with the wild type, transgenic HOSUT grains take up more sucrose (Suc) in vitro, showing that the transgene is functional. Grain Suc levels are not altered, indicating that Suc fluxes are influenced rather than steady-state levels. HOSUT grains have increased percentages of total nitrogen and prolamins, which is reflected in increased levels of phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, isoleucine, and leucine at late grain development. Transcript profiling indicates specific stimulation of prolamin gene expression at the onset of storage phase. Changes in gene expression and metabolite levels related to carbon metabolism and amino acid biosynthesis suggest deregulated carbon-nitrogen balance, which together indicate carbon sufficiency and relative depletion of nitrogen. Genes, deregulated together with prolamin genes, might represent candidates, which respond positively to assimilate supply and are related to sugar-starch metabolism, cytokinin and brassinosteroid functions, cell proliferation, and sugar/abscisic acid signaling. Genes showing inverse expression patterns represent potential negative regulators. It is concluded that HvSUT1 overexpression increases grain protein content but also deregulates the metabolic status of wheat (Triticum aestivum) grains, accompanied by up-regulated gene expression of positive and negative regulators related to sugar signaling and assimilate supply. In HOSUT grains, alternating stimulation of positive and negative regulators causes oscillatory patterns of gene expression and highlights the capacity and great flexibility to adjust wheat grain storage metabolism in response to metabolic alterations."
"20410664","articletitle","Molecular mapping of the suppressor gene Igc1 to the gametocidal gene Gc3-C1 in common wheat."
"20410664","abstracttext","Several species of the genus Aegilops, wild relatives of wheat (Triticum aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD) carry gametocidal (Gc) genes. Gc genes kill the gametes without themselves by causing chromosomal breakage during post-meiotic cell divisions, and therefore are strong segregation distorters. The Gc gene Gc3-C1 derived from chromosome 3C of Ae. triuncialis (2n = 4x = 28, CCUU) induces chromosomal breakage in wheat cultivar 'Chinese Spring' (CS) but not in cultivar 'Norin 26' (N26). This cultivar-specific inhibition of Gc function is caused by a suppressor gene Igc1 located on chromosome 3B of N26. Igc1 is presumed to be a modified Gc gene without breakage function because of its homoeology to Gc3-C1. Here we report the results of linkage and physical mapping of Igc1 to help elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying Gc action. Segregation analysis of the phenotypic data in BC(1)F(1) mapping population of the cross between (CSxN26)F(1) and CS + 3C"" showed a 1:1 segregation ratio indicating that Igc1 is a dominant gene. In the linkage analysis, three molecular marker loci Xgwm285, Xgwm376, and Xcfp1886 cosegregated with the Igc1 locus. Bin mapping assigned the loci Xgwm285 and Xcfp1886 to bin C-3BS1-0.33 and Xgwm376 to bin C-3BL2-0.22. Physical mapping using Gc-induced chromosomal deletion lines of chromosome 3B of N26 revealed that the Igc1 locus resides in 52.0% or 2.1% of bins C-3BS1-0.33 and C-3BL2-0.22, respectively. Pericentromeric localization of Igc1 in chromosome 3B of N26 may have a positive effect to keep the two-component system of the Gc action. Map-based cloning approach to isolate the Igc1 may be difficult because recombination is depleted in the pericentromeric region. As is shown in this study, the combination of genetic and physical mapping offers high efficiency to identify the regions where genes are located especially in regions with low levels of recombination."

"24838645","abstracttext_key message","Quantitative trait loci conferring adult plant resistance to Ug99 stem rust in Thatcher wheat display complementary gene action suggesting multiple quantitative trait loci are needed for effective resistance. Adult plant resistance (APR) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is desirable because this resistance can be Pgt race non-specific. Resistance derived from cultivar Thatcher can confer high levels of APR to the virulent Pgt race TTKSK (Ug99) when combined with stem rust resistance gene Sr57 (Lr34). To identify the loci conferring APR in Thatcher, we evaluated 160 RILs derived from Thatcher crossed to susceptible cultivar McNeal for field stem rust reaction in Kenya for two seasons and in St. Paul for one season. All RILs and parents were susceptible as seedlings to race TTKSK. However, adult plant stem rust severities in Kenya varied from 5 to 80 %. Composite interval mapping identified four quantitative trait loci (QTL). Three QTL were inherited from Thatcher and one, Sr57, was inherited from McNeal. The markers closest to the QTL peaks were used in an ANOVA to determine the additive and epistatic effects. A QTL on 3BS was detected in all three environments and explained 27-35 % of the variation. The peak of this QTL was at the same location as the Sr12 seedling resistance gene effective to race SCCSC. Epistatic interactions were significant between Sr12 and QTL on chromosome arms 1AL and 2BS. Though Sr12 cosegregated with the largest effect QTL, lines with Sr12 were not always resistant. The data suggest that Sr12 or a linked gene, though not effective to race TTKSK alone, confers APR when combined with other resistance loci."

Henn.) in the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar 'Waldron' (WDR) were determined by monosomic analyses. Wheat lines WDR-B1, -C2, -E4, and -F1,which have single genes for resistance to stem rust derived previously from WDR sel. 'Little Club', were crossed onto a complete set of 21 'Chinese Spring' monosomics. The F2 and backcross-F1 (BC1F1) seedlings from each of the 84 crosses were tested for reaction to culture 111-SS2 (CRL-LCBB) of stem rust, and a few selected segregants were analyzed cytologically for chromosome number. The F2 from 2 crosses of WDR-C2, -E4 and -F1 and the BC1F1 from 2 crosses of WDR-F1 were tested also with culture Or11c (CRL-QBCN). Significant deviations from disomic ratios towards monosomic ratios in the F2 and BC1F1 were used to determine which chromosomes carried the genes for resistance. Cytological analyses of certain BC1F1 and susceptible F2 plants were used to help identify the location of the genes for rust resistance. WDR-B1 has a gene, herein designated Sr41, for resistance on chromosome 4D. WDR-C2 has a gene on chromosome 7 A that may be the same as one previously designated SrWld2. WDR-E4 has a gene on chromosome 2A, possibly SrWld1, which is effective against most or all North American stem rust cultures. WDR-F1 has a gene on chromosome 6B that is the same as or similar to Sr11."

"29896167","abstracttext","The effects of fertilizer regime on bulk soil microbial communities have been well studied, but this is not the case for the rhizosphere microbiome. The aim of this work was to assess the impact of fertilization regime on wheat rhizosphere microbiome assembly and 16S rRNA gene-predicted functions with soil from the long term Broadbalk experiment at Rothamsted Research. Soil from four N fertilization regimes (organic N, zero N, medium inorganic N and high inorganic N) was sown with seeds of Triticum aestivum cv. Cadenza. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing was performed with the Illumina platform on bulk soil and rhizosphere samples of 4-week-old and flowering plants (10 weeks). Phylogenetic and 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional analyses were performed. Fertilization regime affected the structure and composition of wheat rhizosphere bacterial communities. Acidobacteria and Planctomycetes were significantly depleted in treatments receiving inorganic N, whereas the addition of high levels of inorganic N enriched members of the phylum Bacteroidetes, especially after 10 weeks. Bacterial richness and diversity decreased with inorganic nitrogen inputs and was highest after organic treatment (FYM). In general, high levels of inorganic nitrogen fertilizers negatively affect bacterial richness and diversity, leading to a less stable bacterial community structure over time, whereas, more stable bacterial communities are provided by organic amendments. 16S rRNA gene-predicted functional structure was more affected by growth stage than by fertilizer treatment, although, some functions related to energy metabolism and metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides were enriched in samples not receiving any inorganic N, whereas inorganic N addition enriched predicted functions related to metabolism of other amino acids and carbohydrates. Understanding the impact of different fertilizers on the structure and dynamics of the rhizosphere microbiome is an important step toward developing strategies for production of crops in a sustainable way."

"27899926","abstracttext","Extensive studies in Arabidopsis and rice have demonstrated that Subgroup-A members of the bZIP transcription factor family play important roles in plant responses to multiple abiotic stresses. Although common wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) is one of the most widely cultivated and consumed food crops in the world, there are limited investigations into Subgroup A of the bZIP family in wheat. In this study, we performed bioinformatic analyses of the 41 Subgroup-A members of the wheat bZIP family. Phylogenetic and conserved motif analyses showed that most of the Subgroup-A bZIP proteins involved in abiotic stress responses of wheat, Arabidopsis , and rice clustered in Clade A1 of the phylogenetic tree, and shared a majority of conserved motifs, suggesting the potential importance of Clade-A1 members in abiotic stress responses. Gene structure analysis showed that TabZIP genes with close phylogenetic relationships tended to possess similar exon-intron compositions, and the positions of introns in the hinge regions of the bZIP domains were highly conserved, whereas introns in the leucine zipper regions were at variable positions. Additionally, eleven groups of homologs and two groups of tandem paralogs were also identified in Subgroup A of the wheat bZIP family. Expression profiling analysis indicated that most Subgroup-A TabZIP genes were responsive to abscisic acid and various abiotic stress treatments. TabZIP27, TabZIP74, TabZIP138, and TabZIP174 proteins were localized in the nucleus of wheat protoplasts, whereas TabZIP9-GFP fusion protein was simultaneously present in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and cell membrane. Transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing TabZIP174 displayed increased seed germination rates and primary root lengths under drought treatments. Overexpression of TabZIP174 in transgenic Arabidopsis conferred enhanced drought tolerance, and transgenic plants exhibited lower water loss rates, higher survival rates, higher proline, soluble sugar, and leaf chlorophyll contents, as well as more stable osmotic potential under drought conditions. Additionally, overexpression of TabZIP174 increased the expression of stress-responsive genes ( RD29A, RD29B, RAB18, DREB2A, COR15A , and COR47 ). The improved drought resistance might be attributed to the increased osmotic adjustment capacity. Our results indicate that TabZIP174 may participate in regulating plant response to drought stress and holds great potential for genetic improvement of abiotic stress tolerance in crops."

"30022985","abstracttext","Parastagonospora nodorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.), one of the world's most important crops. P. nodorum mediates host cell death using proteinaceous necrotrophic effectors, presumably liberating nutrients that allow the infection process to continue. The identification of pathogen effectors has allowed host genetic resistance mechanisms to be separated into their constituent parts. In P. nodorum , three proteinaceous effectors have been cloned: SnToxA , SnTox1 , and SnTox3 . Here, we survey sensitivity to all three effectors in a panel of 480 European wheat varieties, and fine-map the wheat SnTox3 sensitivity locus Snn3-B1 using genome-wide association scans (GWAS) and an eight-founder wheat multi-parent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population. Using a Bonferroni corrected P ≤ 0.05 significance threshold, GWAS identified 10 significant markers defining a single locus, Snn3-B1 , located on the short arm of chromosome 5B explaining 32% of the phenotypic variation [peak single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), Excalibur_c47452_183 and GENE-3324_338, -log 10 P = 20.44]. Single marker analysis of SnTox3 sensitivity in the MAGIC population located Snn3-B1 via five significant SNPs, defining a 6.2-kb region that included the two peak SNPs identified in the association mapping panel. Accordingly, SNP Excalibur_c47452_183 was converted to the KASP genotyping system, and validated by screening a subset of 95 wheat varieties, providing a valuable resource for marker assisted breeding and for further genetic investigation. In addition, composite interval mapping in the MAGIC population identified six minor SnTox3 sensitivity quantitative trait loci, on chromosomes 2A ( QTox3.niab-2A.1, P- value = 9.17 -7 ), 2B ( QTox3.niab-2B.1 , P = 0.018), 3B ( QTox3.niab-3B.1 , P = 48.51 -4 ), 4D ( QTox3.niab-4D.1 , P = 0.028), 6A ( QTox3.niab-6A.1, P = 8.51 -4 ), and 7B ( QTox3.niab-7B.1 , P = 0.020), each accounting for between 3.1 and 6.0 % of the phenotypic variance. Collectively, the outcomes of this study provides breeders with knowledge and resources regarding the sensitivity of European wheat germplasm to P. nodorum effectors, as well as simple diagnostic markers for determining allelic state at Snn3-B1 ."

Chuanmai 42 during the 2008-2009 crop season in Pi County, Sichuan Province, China. More than 10 single pustules were isolated from the diseased leaf samples collected in the field and inoculated on 7-day-old susceptible wheat seedlings cv. Mingxian 169. After 18 to 24 h of incubation at 100% relative humidity in darkness, the plants were moved into the greenhouse, maintained at 15 to 18°C, and supplemented with 10,000 lx of fluorescent light for 10 h per day. The second leaves were clipped when chlorotic spots appeared on leaves (~7 days postinoculation), and plants were covered with glass cylinders to prevent cross contamination. Urediniospores of each isolate were collected 16 days after inoculation and temporarily kept in a dryer at low temperature (3 to 4°C). The virulence spectra of the isolates were tested on Chinese differentials and wheat lines with known Yr genes at the seedling stage (1). A new Yr24 (=Yr26) virulent pathotype, different from currently known pathotypes in China, was identified. To our knowledge, this is the first detection of Yr24 virulence in Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici populations on Chuanmai 42. In addition, the new pathotype was also virulent to Lantian 17, Guinong 22 (Chinese differential), and 92R137 derived wheat lines Nannong 04Y10 and Nannong 05Y628, known to carry Yr24 (2,3). The avirulence/virulence formula of the new pathotype is Yr1, 3, 4, H46, 5, 6, 15, 17, 18, 32, Sp, Sd/Yr2, 8, 9, 10, 12, 24 (=26), 31, and Su.

In this study, we analyzed the Hsf expression profiles in the advanced development stages of wheat, isolated the markedly heat-responsive gene TaHsfA2-10 (GenBank accession number MK922287), and characterized this gene and its role in thermotolerance regulation in seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana (L. Heynh.)."
"32746866","abstracttext_results","In the advanced development stages, wheat Hsf family transcription profiles exhibit different expression patterns and varying heat-responses in leaves and roots, and Hsfs are constitutively expressed to different degrees under the normal growth conditions. Overall, the majority of group A and B Hsfs are expressed in leaves while group C Hsfs are expressed at higher levels in roots. The expression of a few Hsf genes could not be detected. Heat shock (HS) caused upregulation about a quarter of genes in leaves and roots, while a number of genes were downregulated in response to HS. The highly heat-responsive gene TaHsfA2-10 was isolated through homeologous cloning. qRT-PCR revealed that TaHsfA2-10 is expressed in a wide range of tissues and organs of different development stages of wheat under the normal growth conditions. Compared to non-stress treatment, TaHsfA2-10 was highly upregulated in response to HS, H 2 O 2, and salicylic acid (SA), and was downregulated by abscisic acid (ABA) treatment in two-leaf-old seedlings. Transient transfection of tobacco epidermal cells revealed subcellular localization of TaHsfA2-10 in the nucleus under the normal growth conditions. Phenotypic observation indicated that TaHsfA2-10 could improve both basal thermotolerance and acquired thermotolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and rescue the thermotolerance defect of the T-DNA insertion mutant athsfa2 during HS. Compared to wild type (WT) seedlings, the TaHsfA2-10-overexpressing lines displayed both higher chlorophyll contents and higher survival rates. Yeast one-hybrid assay results revealed that TaHsfA2-10 had transactivation activity.

"30732072","abstracttext","Leaf rust resistance gene Lr21 is present in hard red spring wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars grown in Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Manitoba, and Saskatchewan. Isolates of Puccinia triticina, the causal organism of wheat leaf rust, with virulence to this gene have not been previously detected in annual virulence surveys in the United States. (2). In 2010, hard red spring wheat cvs. Faller, RB07 (1), and Glenn, all with Lr21, had 0 to 5% levels of leaf rust severity, which was higher than in previous years in research plots in North Dakota and Minnesota. Leaf rust collections from wheat cultivars and germplasm lines with Lr21 at three locations in Minnesota and North Dakota were increased on plants of the leaf rust susceptible wheat Thatcher and the Thatcher line with Lr21. Single uredinia from the collections were isolated and increased on seedlings of Thatcher. The single uredinial isolates were inoculated to 7- to 8-day-old seedling plants of the set of 19 differential lines that are currently used in the leaf rust virulence surveys (2). Thatcher lines with Lr3bg, Lr14b, Lr20, and Lr23 were also tested. The isolates were also inoculated to seedling plants of hard red spring wheat cultivars with Lr21: Glenn, Steele-ND, Faller, RB07, Amidon, AC Cora, and McKenzie (3). Previous standardized methods for growing seedling plants, increase of rust isolates, inoculation, incubation, and evaluation of infection types (IT) were used (2). All tests with the Thatcher differential lines and the cultivars with Lr21 were repeated at least twice. Virulence phenotypes were described based on virulence to the 19 differentials in the P. triticina virulence nomenclature system used in the United States. (2). Two virulence phenotypes, TFBJQ and TFBGQ, with virulence to Lr21 were found at the three locations. TFBJQ is virulent (IT 3 to 4) to genes Lr1, 2a, 2c, 3, 10, 14a, 14b, 20, 21, 24, 26, 28, and avirulent (IT 0 to 2 + ) to genes Lr3ka, Lr3bg, Lr9, Lr11, Lr17, Lr18, Lr30, LrB, and Lr39/41. TFBGQ was avirulent to Lr14a and Lr20, but identical to TFBJQ for virulence and avirulence to the other resistance genes. Isolates of both phenotypes were virulent on seedlings of Faller, Glenn, RB07 (1), Steele-ND, AC Cora, and Amidon. McKenzie had IT of 2 + due to the additional presence of Lr16 (3). Both TFBJQ and TFBGQ have intermediate IT of 2 + to Lr16; IT 2 + 3 to Lr23, and are completely virulent to Lr1, Lr2a, and Lr10 that are present in hard red spring wheat cultivars. Both phenotypes have high IT to Lr24 and Lr26 that are present in soft red winter wheat and hard red winter wheat cultivars. The Lr21 virulent phenotypes likely arose by mutation from the group of P. triticina genotypes in the simple sequence repeat group NA-5 (4) that have intermediate IT of ;2 - to ;2 + to the Thatcher line with Lr21. P. triticina isolates with virulence to Lr21 are a new threat to wheat production since in 2010 more than 50% of the hard red spring wheat acreage in Minnesota and North Dakota relied on Lr21 for effective resistance to leaf rust.

"19723322","abstracttext_background","Biogenic emissions of methyl halides (CH3Cl, CH3Br and CH3I) are the major source of these compounds in the atmosphere; however, there are few reports about the halide profiles and strengths of these emissions. Halide ion methyltransferase (HMT) and halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) enzymes concerning these emissions have been purified and characterized from several organisms including marine algae, fungi, and higher plants; however, the correlation between emission profiles of methyl halides and the enzymatic properties of HMT/HTMT, and their role in vivo remains unclear."
"19723322","abstracttext_results","Thirty-five higher plant species were screened, and high CH3I emissions and HMT/HTMT activities were found in higher plants belonging to the Poaceae family, including wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.), as well as the Brassicaceae family, including daikon radish (Raphanus sativus). The in vivo emission of CH3I clearly correlated with HMT/HTMT activity. The emission of CH3I from the sprouting leaves of R. sativus, T. aestivum and O. sativa grown hydroponically increased with increasing concentrations of supplied iodide. A gene encoding an S-adenosylmethionine halide/thiol methyltransferase (HTMT) was cloned from R. sativus and expressed in Escherichia coli as a soluble protein. The recombinant R. sativus HTMT (RsHTMT) was revealed to possess high specificity for iodide (I-), bisulfide ([SH]-), and thiocyanate ([SCN]-) ions."
"19723322","abstracttext_conclusion","The present findings suggest that HMT/HTMT activity is present in several families of higher plants including Poaceae and Brassicaceae, and is involved in the formation of methyl halides. Moreover, it was found that the emission of methyl iodide from plants was affected by the iodide concentration in the cultures. The recombinant RsHTMT demonstrated enzymatic properties similar to those of Brassica oleracea HTMT, especially in terms of its high specificity for iodide, bisulfide, and thiocyanate ions. A survey of biogenic emissions of methyl halides strongly suggests that the HTM/HTMT reaction is the key to understanding the biogenesis of methyl halides and methylated sulfur compounds in nature."

"24460856","abstracttext_results","The mitochondrial genome of the T. turgidum was 451,678 bp in length with high structural and nucleotide identity to the previously characterized T. aestivum genome. The assembled mitochondrial genome of the (lo) durum and the Ae. longissima were 431,959 bp and 399,005 bp in size, respectively. The high sequence coverage for all three genomes allowed analysis of heteroplasmy within each genome. The mitochondrial genome structure in the alloplasmic line was genetically distant from both maternal and paternal genomes. The alloplasmic durum and the Ae. longissima carry the same versions of atp6, nad6, rps19-p, cob and cox2 exon 2 which are different from the T. turgidum parent. Evidence of paternal leakage was also observed by analyzing nad9 and orf359 among all three lines. Nucleotide search identified a number of open reading frames, of which 27 were specific to the (lo) durum line."
"24460856","abstracttext_conclusions","Several heteroplasmic regions were observed within genes and intergenic regions of the mitochondrial genomes of all three lines. The number of rearrangements and nucleotide changes in the mitochondrial genome of the alloplasmic line that have occurred in less than half a century was significant considering the high sequence conservation between the T. turgidum and the T. aestivum that diverged from each other 10,000 years ago. We showed that the changes in genes were not limited to paternal leakage but were sufficiently significant to suggest that other mechanisms, such as recombination and mutation, were responsible. The newly formed ORFs, differences in gene sequences and copy numbers, heteroplasmy, and substoichiometric changes show the potential of the alloplasmic condition to accelerate evolution towards forming new mitochondrial genomes."

"29516314","abstracttext","Little is known about the composition, diversity, and geographical distribution of bacterial communities associated with medicinal plants in arid lands. To address this, a collection of 116 endophytic bacteria were isolated from wild populations of the herb Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch (licorice) in Xinyuan, Gongliu, and Tekesi of Xinjiang Province, China, and identified based on their 16S rRNA gene sequences. The endophytes were highly diverse, including 20 genera and 35 species. The number of distinct bacterial genera obtained from root tissues was higher (n = 14) compared to stem (n = 9) and leaf (n = 6) tissue. Geographically, the diversity of culturable endophytic genera was higher at the Tekesi (n = 14) and Xinyuan (n = 12) sites than the Gongliu site (n = 4), reflecting the extremely low organic carbon content, high salinity, and low nutrient status of Gongliu soils. The endophytic bacteria exhibited a number of plant growth-promoting activities ex situ, including diazotrophy, phosphate and potassium solubilization, siderophore production, auxin synthesis, and production of hydrolytic enzymes. Twelve endophytes were selected based on their ex situ plant growth-promoting activities for growth chamber assays to test for their ability to promote growth of G. uralensis F. and Triticum aestivum (wheat) plants. Several strains belonging to the genera Bacillus (n = 6) and Achromobacter (n = 1) stimulated total biomass production in both G. uralensis and T. aestivum under low-nutrient conditions. This work is the first report on the isolation and characterization of endophytes associated with G. uralensis F. in arid lands. The results demonstrate the broad diversity of endophytes associated with wild licorice and suggest that some Bacillus strains may be promising candidates for biofertilizers to promote enhanced survival and growth of licorice and other valuable crops in arid environments."

"16593932","abstracttext","Most species of the genus Lophopyrum Löve (Agropyron Geartn.) grow in saline environments and are more tolerant of saline stress than the species of the related genus Triticum L. A 56-chromosome amphiploid from the cross Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring x Lophopyrum elongatum exceeded Chinese Spring in salt tolerance, measured as plant dry-matter production and seed yield in solution cultures with 250 mM NaCl. Thus, the adaptation of Lophopyrum to saline environments is expressed in the wheat genetic background. None of the disomic additions or substitutions of L. elongatum chromosomes in Chinese Spring showed a similar level of saline stress tolerance, which indicates that the trait depends on the activity of genes on more than one chromosome. Comparisons of disomic additions, double monosomic additions from half-diallel crosses among disomic additions, and disomic substitutions of L. elongatum chromosomes in Chinese Spring with Chinese Spring indicated that the enhanced salt tolerance of the amphiploid is primarily controlled by genes with minor effects on three of the seven chromosomes, 3E, 4E, and 7E, interacting in a largely additive manner. The salt tolerance of L. elongatum additionally depends on several minor nonadditive gene interactions. It is concluded that the adaptation of L. elongatum to growth in saline environments evolved by accumulation of new alleles in a number of loci, each with a relatively small effect on salt tolerance. It is further inferred that most of these new alleles were codominant to the original alleles and were able to act independently in enhancing salt tolerance."

A high level of polymorphism was observed among the accessions studied (PIC = 0.77). The highest gene diversity was revealed among T. durum genotypes, while the lowest genetic variation was found in T. dicoccoides accessions. The analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed a significant genetic variance (75.56%) among these accessions, representing a high intra-specific genetic diversity within Triticum taxa in Iran. However, such a variance was not observed among their ploidy levels. Based on the genetic similarity analysis, the accessions collected from Iran were divided into two main groups: diploids and polyploids. The genetic similarity among the diploid and polyploid species was 0.85 and 0.89 respectively. There were no significant differences in A genome diversity from different geographic regions. Based on the genetic diversity analyses, we consider there is value in a greater sampling of each species in Iran to discover useful genes for breeding purposes."
"9600953","articletitle","Wheat grain hardness results from highly conserved mutations in the friabilin components puroindoline a and b."
"9600953","abstracttext","""Soft"" and ""hard"" are the two main market classes of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and are distinguished by expression of the Hardness gene. Friabilin, a marker protein for grain softness (Ha), consists of two proteins, puroindoline a and b (pinA and pinB, respectively). We previously demonstrated that a glycine to serine mutation in pinB is linked inseparably to grain hardness. Here, we report that the pinB serine mutation is present in 9 of 13 additional randomly selected hard wheats and in none of 10 soft wheats. The four exceptional hard wheats not containing the serine mutation in pinB express no pinA, the remaining component of the marker protein friabilin. The absence of pinA protein was linked inseparably to grain hardness among 44 near-isogenic lines created between the soft variety Heron and the hard variety Falcon. Both pinA and pinB apparently are required for the expression of grain softness. The absence of pinA protein and transcript and a glycine-to-serine mutation in pinB are two highly conserved mutations associated with grain hardness, and these friabilin genes are the suggested tightly linked components of the Hardness gene. A previously described grain hardness related gene termed ""GSP-1"" (grain softness protein) is not controlled by chromosome 5D and is apparently not involved in grain hardness. The association of grain hardness with mutations in both pinA or pinB indicates that these two proteins alone may function together to effect grain softness. Elucidation of the molecular basis for grain hardness opens the way to understanding and eventually manipulating this wheat endosperm property."
"12177491","articletitle","Barley Cbf3 gene identification, expression pattern, and map location."
"12177491","abstracttext","Although cold and drought adaptation in cereals and other plants involve the induction of a large number of genes, inheritance studies in Triticeae (wheat [Triticum aestivum], barley [Hordeum vulgare], and rye [Secale cereale]) have revealed only a few major loci for frost or drought tolerance that are consistent across multiple genetic backgrounds and environments. One might imagine that these loci could encode highly conserved regulatory factors that have global effects on gene expression; therefore, genes encoding central regulators identified in other plants might be orthologs of these Triticeae stress tolerance genes. The CBF/DREB1 regulators, identified originally in Arabidopsis as key components of cold and drought regulation, merit this consideration. We constructed barley cDNA libraries, screened these libraries and a barley bacterial artificial chromosome library using rice (Oryza sativa) and barley Cbf probes, found orthologs of Arabidopsis CBF/DREB1 genes, and examined the expression and genetic map location of the barley Cbf3 gene, HvCbf3. HvCbf3 was induced by a chilling treatment. HvCbf3 is located on barley chromosome 5H between markers WG364b and saflp58 on the barley cv Dicktoo x barley cv Morex genetic linkage map. This position is some 40 to 50 cM proximal to the winter hardiness quantitative trait locus that includes the Vrn-1H gene, but may coincide with the wheat 5A Rcg1 locus, which governs the threshold temperature at which cor genes are induced. From this, it remains possible that HvCbf3 is the basis of a minor quantitative trait locus in some genetic backgrounds, though that possibility remains to be thoroughly explored."

"18390847","abstracttext","Alterations of mitochondrial-encoded subunits of the F(o)F(1)-ATP synthase are frequently associated with cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) in plants; however, little is known about the relationship of the nuclear encoded subunits of this enzyme with CMS. In the present study, the full cDNA of the gene TaF(A)d that encodes the putative F(A)d subunit of the F(o)F(1)-ATP synthase was isolated from the wheat (Triticum aestivum) fertility restorer '2114' for timopheevii cytoplasm-based CMS. The deduced 238 amino acid polypeptide is highly similar to its counterparts in dicots and other monocots but has low homology to its mammalian equivalents. TaF(A)d is a single copy gene in wheat and maps to the short arm of the group 6 chromosomes. Transient expression of the TaF(A)d-GFP fusion in onion epidermal cells demonstrated TaF(A)d's mitochondrial location. TaF(A)d was expressed abundantly in stem, leaf, anther, and ovary tissues of 2114. Nevertheless, its expression was repressed in anthers of CMS plants with timopheevii cytoplasm. Genic male sterility did not affect its expression in anthers. The expression of the nuclear gene encoding the 20 kDa subunit of F(o) was down-regulated in a manner similar to TaF(A)d in the T-CMS anthers while that of genes encoding the 6 kDa subunit of F(o) and the gamma subunit of F(1) was unaffected. These observations implied that TaF(A)d is under mitochondrial retrograde regulation in the anthers of CMS plants with timopheevii cytoplasm."

"19005655","abstracttext","A cotton (G. hirsutum L.) dehydration responsive element binding protein gene, GhDREB, which encodes a 153 amino acid protein containing a conserved AP2/EREBP domain, was isolated from the cDNA library of cotton cv. Simian 3 by a yeast one-hybrid system. RNA blot analysis showed that the GhDREB gene was induced in cotton seedlings by drought, high salt and cold stresses. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that the GhDREB protein bound specifically to the DRE core element (A/GCCGAC) in vitro. Two expression vectors containing the GhDREB gene with either of the Ubiqutin or rd29A promoters were constructed and transferred into wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by bombardment. Fifty-eight Ubi::GhDREB and 17 rd29A::GhDREB T(0) plants of Yangmai (36 plants) and Lumai (39 plants) were identified by PCR analysis, respectively. Southern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that two or three copies of the GhDREB were integrated into the Yangmai 10 genome and were expressed at the transcriptional level, and three or four copies were integrated into the Lumai 23 genome. Functional analysis indicated that the transgenic plants had improved tolerance to drought, high salt, and freezing stresses through accumulating higher levels of soluble sugar and chlorophyll in leaves after stress treatments. No phenotype differences were observed between transgenic plants and their non-transgenic controls. These results indicated that GhDREB might be useful in improving wheat stress tolerance through genetic engineering."

"21573955","abstracttext","The wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers.:Pers. f.sp. tritici Eriks. and Henn.) resistance gene SrWld1 conditions resistance to all North American stem rust races and is an important gene in hard red spring (HRS) wheat cultivars. A sexually recombined race having virulence to SrWld1 was isolated in the 1980s. Our objective was to determine the genetics of resistance to the race. The recombinant race was tested with the set of stem rust differentials and with a set of 36 HRS and 6 durum cultivars. Chromosomal location studies in cultivars Len, Coteau, and Stoa were completed using aneuploid analysis, molecular markers, and allelism tests. Stem rust differential tests coded the race as TPPKC, indicating it differed from TPMKC by having added virulence on Sr30 as well as SrWld1. Genes effective against TPPKC were Sr6, Sr9a, Sr9b, Sr13, Sr24, Sr31, and Sr38. Genetic studies of resistance to TPPKC indicated that Len, Coteau, and Stoa likely carried Sr9b, that Coteau and Stoa carried Sr6, and Stoa carried Sr24. Tests of HRS and durum cultivars indicated that five HRS and one durum cultivar were susceptible to TPPKC. Susceptible HRS cultivars were postulated to have SrWld1 as their major stem rust resistance gene. Divide, the susceptible durum cultivar, was postulated to lack Sr13. We concluded that although TPPKC does not constitute a threat similar to TTKSK and its variants, some cultivars would be lost from production if TPPKC became established in the field."

"22216349","abstracttext","Understanding gene flow in genetically modified (GM) crops is critical to answering questions regarding risk-assessment and the coexistence of GM and non-GM crops. In two field experiments, we tested whether rates of cross-pollination differed between GM and non-GM lines of the predominantly self-pollinating wheat Triticum aestivum. In the first experiment, outcrossing was studied within the field by planting ""phytometers"" of one line into stands of another line. In the second experiment, outcrossing was studied over distances of 0.5-2.5 m from a central patch of pollen donors to adjacent patches of pollen recipients. Cross-pollination and outcrossing was detected when offspring of a pollen recipient without a particular transgene contained this transgene in heterozygous condition. The GM lines had been produced from the varieties Bobwhite or Frisal and contained Pm3b or chitinase/glucanase transgenes, respectively, in homozygous condition. These transgenes increase plant resistance against pathogenic fungi. Although the overall outcrossing rate in the first experiment was only 3.4%, Bobwhite GM lines containing the Pm3b transgene were six times more likely than non-GM control lines to produce outcrossed offspring. There was additional variation in outcrossing rate among the four GM-lines, presumably due to the different transgene insertion events. Among the pollen donors, the Frisal GM line expressing a chitinase transgene caused more outcrossing than the GM line expressing both a chitinase and a glucanase transgene. In the second experiment, outcrossing after cross-pollination declined from 0.7-0.03% over the test distances of 0.5-2.5 m. Our results suggest that pollen-mediated gene flow between GM and non-GM wheat might only be a concern if it occurs within fields, e.g. due to seed contamination. Methodologically our study demonstrates that outcrossing rates between transgenic and other lines within crops can be assessed using a phytometer approach and that gene-flow distances can be efficiently estimated with population-level PCR analyses."

"26120730","abstracttext","Race Ug99 (TTKSK) of Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, detected in Uganda in 1998, has been recognized as a serious threat to food security because it possesses combined virulence to a large number of resistance genes found in current widely grown wheat (Triticum aestivum) varieties and germplasm, leading to its potential for rapid spread and evolution. Since its initial detection, variants of the Ug99 lineage of stem rust have been discovered in Eastern and Southern African countries, Yemen, Iran, and Egypt. To date, eight races belonging to the Ug99 lineage are known. Increased pathogen monitoring activities have led to the identification of other races in Africa and Asia with additional virulence to commercially important resistance genes. This has led to localized but severe stem rust epidemics becoming common once again in East Africa due to the breakdown of race-specific resistance gene SrTmp, which was deployed recently in the 'Digalu' and 'Robin' varieties in Ethiopia and Kenya, respectively. Enhanced research in the last decade under the umbrella of the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative has identified various race-specific resistance genes that can be utilized, preferably in combinations, to develop resistant varieties. Research and development of improved wheat germplasm with complex adult plant resistance (APR) based on multiple slow-rusting genes has also progressed. Once only the Sr2 gene was known to confer slow rusting APR; now, four more genes-Sr55, Sr56, Sr57, and Sr58-have been characterized and additional quantitative trait loci identified. Cloning of some rust resistance genes opens new perspectives on rust control in the future through the development of multiple resistance gene cassettes. However, at present, disease-surveillance-based chemical control, large-scale deployment of new varieties with multiple race-specific genes or adequate levels of APR, and reducing the cultivation of susceptible varieties in rust hot-spot areas remains the best stem rust management strategy."

"26040116","abstracttext","Salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses limiting grain yield in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Wheat early salt-stress response gene (WESR3) is one of the major salt stress genes, which is affected in the first phase of salt stress. In this study, sequence and structural analysis of protein coded by WESR3 gene was carried out using various bioinformatics tools. Sequence analysis of WESR3 protein revealed the presence of highly conserved regions of Mlo gene family. Three-dimensional modeling was carried out to elucidate its structure and its active site. The sequence analysis revealed that WESR3 protein might be involved in fungal pathogen attack pathway. Thus, in addition to its involvement in abiotic stresses, it also seemed to play an important part in biotic stress pathways. Out of the three modeled protein structures obtained from I-TASSER, HHPred and QUARK, the I-TASSER protein model was the best model based on high confidence score and lesser number of bad contacts. The Ramchandran plot analysis also showed that all amino acid residues of I-TASSER model lie in the allowed region and thus indicating towards the overall good quality of the predicted model. Seventeen active sites were predicted in the protein bearing resemblance to the Mlo family conserved regions. In conclusion, a detailed analysis of WESR3 protein suggested an important role of WESR3 in biotic and abiotic stress. These results aid to the experimental data and help to build up a complete view of WESR3 proteins and their role in plant stress response."

Genetic analysis of the thousand grain weight (TGW) by genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed with a panel of 358 European winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) varieties and 14 spring wheat varieties using phenotypic data of field tests in eight environments. Wide phenotypic variations were indicated for the TGW with BLUEs (best linear unbiased estimations) values ranging from 35.9 to 58.2 g with a mean value of 45.4 g and a heritability of H(2) = 0.89. A total of 12 candidate genes for plant height, photoperiodism and grain weight were genotyped on all varieties. Only three candidates, the photoperiodism gene Ppd-D1, dwarfing gene Rht-B1and the TaGW-6A gene were significant explaining up to 14.4, 2.3, and 3.4% of phenotypic variation, respectively. For a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of TGW-QTL genotyping data from 732 microsatellite markers and a set of 7769 mapped SNP-markers genotyped with the 90k iSELECT array were analyzed. In total, 342 significant (-log10 (P-value) ≥ 3.0) marker trait associations (MTAs) were detected for SSR-markers and 1195 MTAs (-log10(P-value) ≥ 3.0) for SNP-markers in all single environments plus the BLUEs. After Bonferroni correction, 28 MTAs remained significant for SSR-markers (-log10 (P-value) ≥ 4.82) and 58 MTAs for SNP-markers (-log10 (P-value) ≥ 5.89). Apart from chromosomes 4B and 6B for SSR-markers and chromosomes 4D and 5D for SNP-markers, MTAs were detected on all chromosomes. The highest number of significant SNP-markers was found on chromosomes 3B and 1B, while for the SSRs most markers were significant on chromosomes 6D and 3D. Overall, TGW was determined by many markers with small effects. Only three SNP-markers had R(2) values above 6%."

The results of analysis of variance revealed highly significant differences among genotypes for all the investigated traits. The results of joint regression analysis showed that the data for all the investigated traits fitted a simple additive dominance model. Graphical representation of variance and covariance suggested that most of the investigated traits were controlled by overdominance gene action. However, the peduncle length and plant height were controlled by additive gene action. Variety 6309 carried the highest number of dominant genes for the number of spikelets per spike, number of tillers per plant, plant height, number of fertile tillers per plant, and grain yield per plant. Chakwal-50 carried the highest number of recessive genes for grain yield per plant, number of tillers per plant, number of grains per spike, number of fertile tillers per plant, and plant height. Chakwal-50 and 6309 were the best general combiners for number of spikelets per spike, number of grains per spike, grain yield per plant, 1000-grain weight, number of fertile tillers per plant, and number of tillers per plant.

"27713749","abstracttext","The leucine rich repeat receptor like kinases (LRRK) constitute the largest subfamily of receptor like kinases (RLK), which play critical roles in plant development and stress responses. Herein, we identified 531 TaLRRK genes in Triticum aestivum (bread wheat), which were distributed throughout the A, B, and D sub-genomes and chromosomes. These were clustered into 233 homologous groups, which were mostly located on either homeologous chromosomes from various sub-genomes or in proximity on the same chromosome. A total of 255 paralogous genes were predicted which depicted the role of duplication events in expansion of this gene family. Majority of TaLRRKs consisted of trans-membrane region and localized on plasma-membrane. The TaLRRKs were further categorized into eight phylogenetic groups with numerous subgroups on the basis of sequence homology. The gene and protein structure in terms of exon/intron ratio, domains, and motifs organization were found to be variably conserved across the different phylogenetic groups/subgroups, which indicated a potential divergence and neofunctionalization during evolution. High-throughput transcriptome data and quantitative real time PCR analyses in various developmental stages, and biotic and abiotic (heat, drought, and salt) stresses provided insight into modus operandi of TaLRRKs during these conditions. Distinct expression of majority of stress responsive TaLRRKs homologous genes suggested their specified role in a particular condition. These results provided a comprehensive analysis of various characteristic features including functional divergence, which may provide the way for future functional characterization of this important gene family in bread wheat."

"32696139","abstracttext_main conclusion","Two homoeologous wheat genes, TaSIRFP-3A and TaSIRFP-3B, encode the RING-HC-type E3 ligases that play an inhibitory role in sucrose metabolism in response to cold stress. In higher plants, the attachment of ubiquitin (Ub) and the subsequent recognition and degradation by the 26S proteasome affects a variety of cellular functions that are essential for survival. Here, we characterized the two homoeologous wheat genes encoding the really interesting new gene (RING) HC-type E3 ligases: TaSIRFP-3A and TaSIRFP-3B (Triticum aestivum SINA domain including RING finger protein 1 and 2), which regulate target proteins via the Ub/26S proteasome system. The TaSIRFP-3A gene was highly expressed under cold stress. In contrast, its homoeologous gene, TaSIRFP-3B, showed only a slight increase in expression levels in shoots. Despite these differences, both the proteins exhibited E3 ligase activity with the cytosol- and nucleus-targeted localization, demonstrating their conserved molecular function. Heterogeneous overexpression of TaSIRFP-3A or TaSIRFP-3B in Arabidopsis showed delayed plant growth causing a reduction in sucrose synthase enzymatic activity and photosynthetic sucrose synthesis, by regulating sucrose synthase proteins. TaSIRFP-3A- or TaSIRFP-3B-overexpressing plants showed higher hypersensitivity under cold stress than WT plants with an accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results suggest that the negative regulation of TaSIRFP-3A and TaSIRFP-3B in response to cold stress is involved in sucrose metabolism."

"29990369","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, non-coding and regulatory RNAs produce by cell endogenously. They are 18-26 nucleotides in length and play important roles at the post-transcriptional stage of gene regulation. Evolutionarily, miRNAs are conserved and their conservation plays an important role in the prediction of new miRNAs in different plants. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is an important diet and consumed as second major crop in the world. This significant cereal crop was focused here through comparative genomics-based approach to identify new conserved miRNAs and their targeted genes. This resulted into a total of 212 new conserved precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs) belonging to 185 miRNA families. These newly profiled wheat's miRNAs are also annotated for stem-loop secondary structures, length distribution, organ of expression, sense/antisense orientation and characterization from their expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Moreover, fifteen miRNAs along with housekeeping gene were randomly selected and subjected to RT-PCR expressional validation. A total of 32927 targets are also predicted and annotated for these newly profiled wheat miRNAs. These targets are found to involve in 50 gene ontology (GO) enrichment terms and significant processes. Some of the significant targets are RNA-dependent DNA replication (GO:0006278), RNA binding (GO:0003723), nucleic acid binding (GO:0003676), DNA-directed RNA polymerase activity (GO:0003899), magnesium ion transmembrane transporter activity (GO:0015095), antiporter activity (GO:0015297), solute:hydrogen antiporter activity (GO:0015299), protein kinase activity (GO:0004672), ATP binding (GO:0005524), regulation of Rab GTPase activity (GO:0032313) Rab GTPase activator activity (GO:0005097), regulation of signal transduction (GO:0009966) and phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitor activity (GO:0004864).

"30459796","articletitle","Phosphorus Efficiency Mechanisms of Two Wheat Cultivars as Affected by a Range of Phosphorus Levels in the Field."
"30459796","abstracttext","Phosphorus (P) efficiency includes both P acquisition efficiency (PAE) and internal P utilization efficiency (PUE). Despite substantial research, genotypic variation in PAE and PUE remains incompletely understood in the field. A 2-year field study was conducted to compare PAE and PUE and related morphological, physiological, and molecular root traits of two winter wheat cultivars ( Triticum aestivum L. cv. SJZ8 and KN92) in response to six P application rates in a P-deficient calcareous soil. Both cultivars showed similar growth and yield potential at each P supply level, reaching optimal growth at the same P application rate of about 100 kg P ha -1 . However, the two cultivars differed in how they achieved yield and P efficiency. As P supply increased for both cultivars, root dry weight (RDW), root length density, and expression of the phosphate transporter gene TaPHT1.2 in roots initially increased and then stabilized, but arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal colonization, rhizosphere acid phosphatase activity, expressions of the P-starvation marker gene TaIPS1.1 and the purple acid phosphatase gene TaPAP16 in roots initially decreased and then stabilized. To enhance P acquisition when the P supply was deficient, KN92 modified the morphology of its roots, while SJZ8 increased the physiological activities in its roots. With an adequate P supply, high expression of TaPHT1.2 in roots might account for efficient P uptake for both cultivars, especially for KN92. Although P uptake per RDW was similar for both cultivars at anthesis, PAE was higher for KN92 than SJZ8 in terms of total P uptake in aboveground parts, whereas shoot and grain PUE were higher in SJZ8 than in KN92, mainly during the reproductive growth stage. These results indicate that P efficiency is under genotypic control at all P supply levels tested in both wheat cultivars, and that the two cultivars depend on different root strategies for P acquisition and utilization in response to changes in the P supply."

"18701600","abstracttext_background and aims","When root-zone O(2) deficiency occurs together with salinity, regulation of shoot ion concentrations is compromised even more than under salinity alone. Tolerance was evaluated amongst 34 accessions of Hordeum marinum, a wild species in the Triticeae, to combined salinity and root-zone O(2) deficiency. Interest in H. marinum arises from the potential to use it as a donor for abiotic stress tolerance into wheat."
"18701600","abstracttext_methods","Two batches of 17 H. marinum accessions, from (1) the Nordic Gene Bank and (2) the wheat belt of Western Australia, were exposed to 0.2 or 200 mol m(-3) NaCl in aerated or stagnant nutrient solution for 28-29 d. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) was included as a sensitive check species. Growth, root porosity, root radial O(2) loss (ROL) and leaf ion (Na(+), K(+), Cl(-)) concentrations were determined."
"18701600","abstracttext_key results","Owing to space constraints, this report is focused mainly on the accessions from the Nordic Gene Bank. The 17 accessions varied in tolerance; relative growth rate was reduced by 2-38 % in stagnant solution, by 8-42 % in saline solution (aerated) and by 39-71 % in stagnant plus saline treatment. When in stagnant solution, porosity of adventitious roots was 24-33 %; salinity decreased the root porosity in some accessions, but had no effect in others. Roots grown in stagnant solution formed a barrier to ROL, but variation existed amongst accessions in apparent barrier 'strength'. Leaf Na(+) concentration was 142-692 micromol g(-1) d. wt for plants in saline solution (aerated), and only increased to 247-748 micromol g(-1) d. wt in the stagnant plus saline treatment. Leaf Cl(-) also showed only small effects of stagnant plus saline treatment, compared with saline alone. In comparison with H. marinum, wheat was more adversely affected by each stress alone, and particularly when combined; growth reductions were greater, adventitious root porosity was 21 %, it lacked a barrier to ROL, leaf K(+) declined to lower levels, and leaf Na(+) and Cl(-) concentrations were 3.1-9-fold and 2.8-6-fold higher, respectively, in wheat."
"18701600","abstracttext_conclusions","Stagnant treatment plus salinity reduced growth more than salinity alone, or stagnant alone, but some accessions of H. marinum were still relatively tolerant of these combined stresses, maintaining Na(+) and Cl(-) 'exclusion' even in an O(2)-deficient, saline rooting medium."

"27503086","abstracttext_background","Many genes involved in responses to photoperiod and vernalization have been characterized or predicted in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). However, little is known about the transcription regulation of these genes, especially in the large, complex genomes of wheat and barley."
"27503086","abstracttext_results","We identified 68, 60, 195 and 61 genes that are known or postulated to control pathways of photoperiod (PH), vernalization (VE) and pathway integration (PI) in Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, wheat and barley for predicting transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) in the promoters of these genes using the FIMO motif search tool of the MEME Suite. The initial predicted TFBSs were filtered to confirm the final numbers of predicted TFBSs to be 1066, 1379, 1528, and 789 in Arabidopsis, Brachypodium, wheat and barley, respectively. These TFBSs were mapped onto the PH, VE and PI pathways to infer about the regulation of gene expression in Arabidopsis and cereal species. The GC contents in promoters, untranslated regions (UTRs), coding sequences and introns were higher in the three cereal species than those in Arabidopsis. The predicted TFBSs were most abundant for two transcription factor (TF) families: MADS-box and CSD (cold shock domain). The analysis of publicly available gene expression data showed that genes with similar numbers of MADS-box and CSD TFBSs exhibited similar expression patterns across several different tissues and developmental stages. The intra-specific Tajima D-statistics of TFBS motif diversity showed different binding specificity among different TF families. The inter-specific Tajima D-statistics suggested faster TFBS divergence in TFBSs than in coding sequences and introns. Mapping TFBSs onto the PH, VE and PI pathways showed the predominance of MADS-box and CSD TFBSs in most genes of the four species, and the difference in the pathway regulations between Arabidopsis and the three cereal species."
"27503086","abstracttext_conclusion","Our approach to associating the key flowering genes with their potential TFs through prediction of putative TFBSs provides a framework to explore regulatory mechanisms of photoperiod and vernalization responses in flowering plants. The predicted TFBSs in the promoters of the flowering genes provide a basis for molecular characterization of transcription regulation in the large, complex genomes of important crop species, wheat and barley."

"30703965","abstracttext","In the spring of 2014, a survey of viral diseases on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was carried out in Hebei Province, China. The samples with virus-like symptoms of dwarfing and flag leaf yellowing were collected in Zhaoxian, Quyang, Anxin, and Luannan. To reproduce the viral symptoms and confirm whether the unknown virus was transmitted by insect vectors, the nymphs of aviruliferous planthopper (Laodelphax striatellus Fallen, Homoptera: Delphacidae) were transferred onto diseased wheat from the field for a 3-day acquisition access period and a 10-day incubation on fresh wheat seedlings, and then were exposed to 2- to 3-leaf stage wheat seedlings of wheat variety Shixin828 for a 3-day inoculation access period. The infected wheat plants developed mosaic symptoms on the young leaves at 7 days post inoculation (dpi), and followed with severe symptoms including stunting, chlorotic spots, and striation along the veins of leaves at around 14 dpi. The infection symptoms were same as in the field but distinct from wheat infected with Rice black streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) or Northern cereal mosaic virus (NCMV). For further confirmation, total RNA was extracted from the symptomatic wheat leaves, and NCMV specific primers, NCMV-PF/NCMV-PR (5'-ATGGATAAGAAAGCAAGTGGA-3'/5'-TTAAAAGTCGGCATACGGGTC-3') and RBSDV specific primers, S10-F/S10-R (5'-TTACCCAACATCACGCAACT-3'/5'-GAGCAGGAACTTCACGACAAC-3') were used for amplification of sequences of phosphoprotein and coat protein genes, respectively. Neither RBSDV nor NCMV were present in the symptomatic tissue according to the RT-PCR assay (4). Tissues derived from symptomatic wheat leaves were fixed and embedded in Spurr's resin and used for ultra-thin sectioning and transmission electron microscopy observations, revealing large amounts of Rhabdovirus-like particles in the cytoplasm. The identified particles were about 315 to 353 × 46 to 57 nm, similar in size to Barley yellow striate mosaic virus (BYSMV), a member of the genus Cytorhabdovirus reported from Italy (2). The specific primer pair (5'-ACTAAGGGGGTACTCCGACC-3' and 5'-CTGATCTGCTTTGAGGGGCA-3') was designed based on the reported polymerase (L) gene sequence of BYSMV isolate Zanjan-1 (GenBank Accession No. FJ665628) (1), and used for the BYSMV detection by RT-PCR. A single bright band of the expected size (~500 bp) was obtained from total RNA extracted from the plants exhibiting symptoms in the greenhouse. No such band was amplified from asymptomatic plants, while 15 out of 23 field samples also produced the same 500-bp products in RT-PCR. PCR products from three virus-positive field samples were sequenced directly and the sequences were submitted to GenBank (KM052176, KM052177, and KM052178). BLAST search showed that the sequences shared 96 to 97% nucleotide identity with the polymerase L gene sequence of BYSMV isolate Zanjan-1, whereas only 73 to 75% identity with NCMV (AB030277 and GU985153) (1,3,5). To our knowledge, this is the first report of BYSMV occurrence on wheat in China. References: (1) R. Almasi et al. J. Phytopathol. 158:351, 2010. (2) A. Appiano et al. Cytol. 6:105, 1974. (3) H. C.

"3209062","articletitle","Biochemical data bearing on the relationship between the genome of Triticum urartu and the A and B genomes of the polyploid wheats."
"3209062","abstracttext","To determine whether the Triticum urartu genome is more closely related to the A or B genome of the polyploid wheats, the amino acid sequence of its purothionin was compared to the amino acid sequences of the purothionins in Triticum monococcum, Triticum turgidum, and Triticum aestivum. The residue sequence of the purothionin from T. urartu differs by five and six amino acid substitutions respectively from the alpha 1 and alpha 2 forms coded for by genes in the B and D genomes, and is identical to the beta form specified by a gene in the A genome. Therefore, the T. urartu purothionin is either coded by a gene in the A genome or a chromosome set highly homologous to it. The results demonstrate that at least a portion of the T. urartu and T. monococcum genomes is homologous and probably identical. A variety of other studies have also shown that T. urartu is very closely related to T. monococcum and, in all likelihood, also possesses the A genome. Therefore, it could be argued that either T. urartu and T. monococcum are the same species or that T. urartu rather than T. monococcum is the source of the A genome in T. turgidum and T. aestivum. Except for Johnson's results, our data and that of others suggest a revised origin of polyploid wheats. Specifically, the list of six putative B genome donor species is reduced to five, all members of the Sitopsis section of the genus Aegilops."

"10938825","abstracttext","Three types of callus tissues established from anther culture of eleven doubled haploid (DH) lines of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were evaluated for their ability in enhancing friable embryogenic (Type II) culture differentiation and genetic transformation. Differences between types of callus inocula were highly significant (P < 0.001), suggesting that the quality of the initial callus explant is of profound importance in encouraging the proliferation of Type II cultures. Other factors found to be crucial included weekly subculture of friable embryogenic callus tissues on a maintenance medium containing 30 microM dicamba and a predominance of amino-acid nitrogen supplement. Transfer and integration of the beta-glucuronidase gene was also affected by the type of inoculum when suitable embryogenic cell cultures were transformed using silicon carbide whiskers and high velocity microprojectiles. Expression of the hygromycin phosphotransferase selectable marker gene sequence was confirmed in all the stably transformed cell lines maintained on selection media containing lethal levels of hygromycin. Comparatively, there were differences in the frequency of regenerable, transgenic clonal segments between whisker-treated and microprojectile bombarded tissues mainly as a result of the fact that cultures vortexed with whiskers were more capable of post-treatment cell proliferation and embryo differentiation than those bombarded with cDNA-coated microprojectiles. Conditions for obtaining these results are outlined and discussed in relation to the suitability of the two transformation strategies for producing transgenic cell aggregates of wheat."
"11706173","articletitle","Components of the Arabidopsis C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factor cold-response pathway are conserved in Brassica napus and other plant species."
"11706173","abstracttext","Many plants increase in freezing tolerance in response to low, nonfreezing temperatures, a phenomenon known as cold acclimation. Cold acclimation in Arabidopsis involves rapid cold-induced expression of the C-repeat/dehydration-responsive element binding factor (CBF) transcriptional activators followed by expression of CBF-targeted genes that increase freezing tolerance. Here, we present evidence for a CBF cold-response pathway in Brassica napus. We show that B. napus encodes CBF-like genes and that transcripts for these genes accumulate rapidly in response to low temperature followed closely by expression of the cold-regulated Bn115 gene, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis CBF-targeted COR15a gene. Moreover, we show that constitutive overexpression of the Arabidopsis CBF genes in transgenic B. napus plants induces expression of orthologs of Arabidopsis CBF-targeted genes and increases the freezing tolerance of both nonacclimated and cold-acclimated plants. Transcripts encoding CBF-like proteins were also found to accumulate rapidly in response to low temperature in wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Norstar) and rye (Secale cereale L. cv Puma), which cold acclimate, as well as in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum var. Bonny Best, Castle Mart, Micro-Tom, and D Huang), a freezing-sensitive plant that does not cold acclimate. An alignment of the CBF proteins from Arabidopsis, B. napus, wheat, rye, and tomato revealed the presence of conserved amino acid sequences, PKK/RPAGRxKFxETRHP and DSAWR, that bracket the AP2/EREBP DNA binding domains of the proteins and distinguish them from other members of the AP2/EREBP protein family. We conclude that components of the CBF cold-response pathway are highly conserved in flowering plants and not limited to those that cold acclimate."

"15712009","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight (FHB), caused by Fusarium graminearum Schwabe [telomorph:Gibberella zeae Schw. (Petch)], is an increasingly important disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Host-plant resistance is considered to be the most economical means of control, but a lack of unique sources of resistance has hindered efforts to breed resistant varieties. The soft red winter wheat, Ernie, has moderately high FHB resistance and is widely used in U.S. breeding programs; however, the genetics of resistance have not been studied. The objectives of this study were to estimate the genetic effects, gene numbers, and heritability for traits related to FHB resistance in Ernie through generation means analyses and variance analyses of 243 F3-derived F8 and F9 recombinant inbred lines (RILs). Replicated experiments were grown in the greenhouse, inoculated with F. graminearum, and evaluated for disease spread and the FHB index (FHBI). The latter was calculated as the percentage of diseased spikelets in inoculated spikes and is often referred to as type-II resistance. Gene action for both disease spread and FHBI was primarily additive with partial dominance for low disease. Broad-sense heritabilities for spread and FHBI were 78.2% and 78.3%, respectively, while the narrow-sense heritabilities were 51.3% and 55.4%, respectively. Line-mean heritabilities from analyses of variance of RILs were 0.70 and 0.87 for spread and FHBI, respectively. A minimum of four genes conditioned both disease spread and FHBI. These results suggest that breeders should be able to enhance FHB resistance by combining the resistance in Ernie with other complementary additive sources of resistance."
"12692333","articletitle","Tolerance of mannitol-accumulating transgenic wheat to water stress and salinity."
"12692333","abstracttext","Previous work with model transgenic plants has demonstrated that cellular accumulation of mannitol can alleviate abiotic stress. Here, we show that ectopic expression of the mtlD gene for the biosynthesis of mannitol in wheat improves tolerance to water stress and salinity. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv Bobwhite) was transformed with the mtlD gene of Escherichia coli. Tolerance to water stress and salinity was evaluated using calli and T(2) plants transformed with (+mtlD) or without (-mtlD) mtlD. Calli were exposed to -1.0 MPa of polyethylene glycol 8,000 or 100 mM NaCl. T(2) plants were stressed by withholding water or by adding 150 mM NaCl to the nutrient medium. Fresh weight of -mtlD calli was reduced by 40% in the presence of polyethylene glycol and 37% under NaCl stress. Growth of +mtlD calli was not affected by stress. In -mtlD plants, fresh weight, dry weight, plant height, and flag leaf length were reduced by 70%, 56%, 40%, and 45% compared with 40%, 8%, 18%, and 29%, respectively, in +mtlD plants. Salt stress reduced shoot fresh weight, dry weight, plant height, and flag leaf length by 77%, 73%, 25%, and 36% in -mtlD plants, respectively, compared with 50%, 30%, 12%, and 20% in +mtlD plants. However, the amount of mannitol accumulated in the callus and mature fifth leaf (1.7-3.7 micromol g(-1) fresh weight in the callus and 0.6-2.0 micromol g(-1) fresh weight in the leaf) was too small to protect against stress through osmotic adjustment. We conclude that the improved growth performance of mannitol-accumulating calli and mature leaves was due to other stress-protective functions of mannitol, although this study cannot rule out possible osmotic effects in growing regions of the plant."

"12783168","abstracttext","Resistance to the disease septoria tritici blotch of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella graminicola (Fuckel.) J. Schrot in Cohn (anamorph Septoria tritici Roberge in Desmaz.) was investigated in a doubled-haploid (DH) population of a cross between the susceptible winter wheat cultivar Savannah and the resistant cultivar Senat. A molecular linkage map of the population was constructed including 76 SSR loci and 244 AFLP loci. Parents and DH progeny were tested for resistance to single isolates of M. graminicola in a growth chamber at the seedling stage, and to an isolate mixture at the adult plant stage, in field trials. A gene located at or near the Stb6 locus mapping to chromosome 3A provided seedling resistance to IPO323. Two complementary genes, mapping to chromosome 3A, one of which was the IPO323 resistance gene, were needed for resistance to the Danish isolate Risø97-86. In addition, a number of minor loci influenced the expression of resistance in the growth chamber. In the field, four QTLs for resistance to septoria tritici blotch were detected. Two QTLs, located on chromosomes 3A and 6B explained 18.2 and 67.9% of the phenotypic variance in the mean over two trials. Both these QTLs were also detected at the seedling stage with isolate Risø97-86, whereas isolate IPO323 only detected the QTL on 3A. Additionally, two QTLs identified in adult plants on chromosomes 2B and 7B were not detected at the seedling stage. Four QTLs were detected for plant height located on chromosomes 2B, 3A, 3B and on a linkage group not assigned to a chromosome. The major QTLs on 3A and on the unassigned linkage group were consistent over two trials, and the QTL on 3A seemed to be linked to a QTL for septoria tritici blotch resistance."

"18470035","abstracttext","Twelve lines of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were developed that had susceptible infection types to leaf rust (Puccinia recondita Rob. ex Desm. f.sp. tritici) race UN 15 in the seedling stage but were resistant in the adult plant stage in the field. The lines were developed from four crosses, each involving four parents (eight in total) that had originally been selected for adult plant or field resistance to stem rust (Puccinia graminis Pers. f.sp. tritici Eriks, and Henn.). The objectives of the present study were to determine the mechanism of resistance to leaf rust and its inheritance in the 12 lines. The 12 lines were grown in an artificially inoculated field nursery in Saskatoon, coefficients of infection (CI) were determined at four dates, and the areas under the disease progress curve (AUDPC) were calculated. Four representative lines were grown in a growth chamber to measure the latent period and pustule size at the two-leaf and flag-leaf stages. Eight lines were crossed and backcrossed to a susceptible check and the parents, F1, F2, F3, and BC1F2 generations were grown in a field nursery. The 12 lines showed wide ranges in CI and AUDPC but all were significantly more resistant than the susceptible check. The four lines studied in the growth chamber had longer latent periods and smaller pustules than the susceptible check at both stages. The differences tended to be greater at the flag-leaf stage. The inheritance studied showed that resistance was recessive or partially recessive and was controlled by two or more genes in each line of the eight lines. In three of the eight lines, Lr34 may be one of the genes and in the other five both Lr13 and Lr34 could be present. However, additional genes are clearly involved. A single gene by itself had only a small effect, but in two and three gene combinations the effects appeared to be greater. This type of resistance appears to occur frequently and may be durable because its complex inheritance may make it more difficult for the rust fungus to overcome. It should be used in breeding wheat for areas where leaf rust is a major problem."

"18508811","abstracttext","A number of COR genes (COld-Regulated genes) have been implicated in the acquisition of low temperature (LT) tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). This study compared the relative expression patterns of selected COR genes in leaf and crown tissues of wheat near-isogenic lines to increase understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying LT acclimation. Reciprocal near-isogenic lines were generated such that the dominant Vrn-A1 and recessive vrn-A1 loci were interchanged in a spring cv. Manitou and a winter cv. Norstar. Phenological development, acquisition of LT tolerance, and WCS120 polypeptide accumulation in these genotypes proceeded at rates similar to those previously reported for 6 degrees C acclimation from 0 to 98 d. However, a differential accumulation of WCS120 polypeptide and expression of the COR genes Wcs120, Wcor410, and Wcor14 was observed in the leaf and crown tissues. COR gene transcript levels peaked at 2 d of the acclimation period in both tissues and differences among genotypes were most evident at this time. COR gene expression was highest for the LT-tolerant and lowest for the tender genotypes. However, expression rates were divergent enough in genotypes with intermediate hardiness that comparisons among tissues and/or times during acclimation often resulted in variable interpretations of the relative expression of the COR genes in the determination of LT tolerance. These observations emphasize the need to pay close attention to experimental conditions, sampling times, and genotype and tissue selection in experiments designed to identify the critical genetic components that interact to determine LT acclimation."

"16306141","abstracttext","To discern expression patterns of individual storage-protein genes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum cv Chinese Spring), we analyzed comprehensive expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of common wheat using a bioinformatics technique. The gene families for alpha/beta-gliadins and low molecular-weight glutenin subunit were selected from the EST database. The alignment of these genes enabled us to trace the single nucleotide polymorphism sites among both genes. The combinations of single nucleotide polymorphisms allowed us to assign haplotypes into their homoeologous chromosomes by allele-specific PCR. Phylogenetic analysis of these genes showed that both storage-protein gene families rapidly diverged after differentiation of the three genomes (A, B, and D). Expression patterns of these genes were estimated based on the frequencies of ESTs. The storage-protein genes were expressed only during seed development stages. The alpha/beta-gliadin genes exhibited two distinct expression patterns during the course of seed maturation: early expression and late expression. Although the early expression genes among the alpha/beta-gliadin and low molecular-weight glutenin subunit genes showed similar expression patterns, and both genes from the D genome were preferentially expressed rather than those from the A or B genome, substantial expression of two early expression genes from the A genome was observed. The phylogenetic relationships of the genes and their expression patterns were not correlated. These lines of evidence suggest that expression of the two storage-protein genes is independently regulated, and that the alpha/beta-gliadin genes possess novel regulation systems in addition to the prolamin box."

"16172895","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) starch synthase II, which is also known as starch granule protein 1 (SGP-1), plays a major role in endosperm starch synthesis. The three SGP-1 proteins, SGP-A1, B1 and D1, are produced by three homoeologous SSII genes, wSSII-A, B, and D. Lines carrying null alleles for each SGP-1 protein have previously been identified. In this report, the mutations occurring in each wSSII gene were characterized, and PCR-based DNA markers capable of detecting the mutations were developed. In the null wSSII-A allele, a 289 bp deletion accompanied by 8 bp of filler DNA was present near the initiation codon. A 175 bp insertion occurred in exon 8 of the null wSSII-B allele. The insertion represented a recently discovered miniature inverted-repeat transposable element (MITE) named Hikkoshi that was first found in a wheat waxy gene. A 63 bp deletion was found at the region surrounding the junction of the fifth exon and intron of the null wSSII-D allele. Based on this information, we designed primer sets to enable us to conduct allele-specific amplifications for each locus. The applicability of these primer sets for breeding programs was demonstrated by reconstructing a line lacking all three SGP-1 proteins using marker-assisted selection. These markers will also be useful in breeding programs aimed at obtaining partial mutants missing one or two SGP-1 proteins."

A full-length cDNA (1,357 bp) of a homeobox-like gene, TaHLRG (GenBank accession no.

The genomic DNA sequence (2,396 bp) of TaHLRG contains three exons and two introns. TaHLRG appeared to be a novel homeobox-like gene, encoding a protein with a predicted 66-amino-acid homeobox domain. It was involved in race-specific responses to stripe rust in real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses with Yr9NIL, Yr10NIL, and Avocet S. It was also associated with adult-plant resistance to stripe rust and powdery mildew based on the field trials of doubled haploid lines derived from the cross Bainong 64/Jingshuang 16 and two F(2:3) populations from the crosses Lumai 21/Jingshuang 16 and Strampelli/Huixianhong.

"17028155","abstracttext","The release of organic anions from roots can protect plants from aluminum (Al) toxicity and help them overcome phosphorus (P) deficiency. Our previous findings showed that Al treatment induced malate and citrate efflux from rape (Brassica napus) roots, and that P deficiency did not induce the efflux. Since this response is similar to the malate efflux from wheat (Triticum aestivum) that is controlled by the TaALMT1 gene, we investigated whether homologs of TaALMT1 are present in rape and whether they are involved in the release of organic anions. We isolated two TaALMT1 homologs from rape designated BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 (B. napus Al-activated malate transporter). The expression of these genes was induced in roots, but not shoots, by Al treatment but P deficiency had no effect. Several other cations (lanthanum, ytterbium, and erbium) also increased BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 expression in the roots. The function of the BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 proteins was investigated by heterologous expression in cultured tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) cells and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Both transfection systems showed an enhanced capacity for malate efflux but not citrate efflux, when exposed to Al. Smaller malate fluxes were also activated by ytterbium and erbium treatment. Transgenic tobacco cells grew significantly better than control cells following an 18 h treatment with Al, indicating that the expression of BnALMT1 and BnALMT2 increased the resistance of these plant cells to Al stress. This report demonstrates that homologs of the TaALMT1 gene from wheat perform similar functions in other species."

"18096080","abstracttext_conclusion","Results presented here indicate, for the first time, a distinct functional role for MSH7 in vivo and show that expression of this gene is necessary for wild-type levels of fertility. These observations suggest that MSH7 has an important function during meiosis and as such remains a candidate for Ph2."

"17977148","abstracttext","Fusarium head blight, caused primarily by Fusarium graminearum, is a major disease problem on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Trichothecene mycotoxins produced by the fungus during infection increase the aggressiveness of the fungus and promote infection in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Loss-of-function mutations in the TRI5 gene in F. graminearum result in the inability to synthesize trichothecenes and in reduced virulence on wheat. We examined the impact of pathogen-derived trichothecenes on virulence and the transcriptional differences in barley spikes infected with a trichothecene-producing wild-type strain and a loss-of-function tri5 trichothecene nonproducing mutant. Disease severity, fungal biomass, and floret necrosis and bleaching were reduced in spikes inoculated with the tri5 mutant strain compared with the wild-type strain, indicating that the inability to synthesize trichothecenes results in reduced virulence in barley. We detected 63 transcripts that were induced during trichothecene accumulation, including genes encoding putative trichothecene detoxification and transport proteins, ubiquitination-related proteins, programmed cell death-related proteins, transcription factors, and cytochrome P450s. We also detected 414 gene transcripts that were designated as basal defense response genes largely independent of trichothecene accumulation. Our results show that barley exhibits a specific response to trichothecene accumulation that can be separated from the basal defense response. We propose that barley responds to trichothecene accumulation by inducing at least two general responses. One response is the induction of genes encoding trichothecene detoxification and transport activities that may reduce the impact of trichothecenes. The other response is to induce genes encoding proteins associated with ubiquitination and cell death which may promote successful establishment of the disease."

"18347772","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is a major disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) that can be controlled by resistance breeding. The CIMMYT bread wheat line Saar is known for its good level of partial and race non-specific resistance, and the aim of this study was to map QTLs for resistance to powdery mildew in a population of 113 recombinant inbred lines from a cross between Saar and the susceptible line Avocet. The population was tested over 2 years in field trials at two locations in southeastern Norway and once in Beijing, China. SSR markers were screened for association with powdery mildew resistance in a bulked segregant analysis, and linkage maps were created based on selected SSR markers and supplemented with DArT genotyping. The most important QTLs for powdery mildew resistance derived from Saar were located on chromosomes 7DS and 1BL and corresponded to the adult plant rust resistance loci Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29. A major QTL was also located on 4BL with resistance contributed by Avocet. Additional QTLs were detected at 3AS and 5AL in the Norwegian testing environments and at 5BS in Beijing. The population was also tested for leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina) and stripe rust (caused by P. striiformis f. sp. tritici) resistance and leaf tip necrosis in Mexico. QTLs for these traits were detected on 7DS and 1BL at the same positions as the QTLs for powdery mildew resistance, and confirmed the presence of Lr34/Yr18 and Lr46/Yr29 in Saar. The powdery mildew resistance gene at the Lr34/Yr18 locus has recently been named Pm38. The powdery mildew resistance gene at the Lr46/Yr29 locus is designated as Pm39."

"20359519","abstracttext","Non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (np-Ga3PDHase) plays a key metabolic role in higher plants. Purification to homogeneity of enzymes found in relatively low abundance in plants represents a major technical challenge that can be solved by molecular gene cloning and heterologous expression. To apply this strategy to np-Ga3PDHase we performed the cloning of the gapN gene from Arabidopsis thaliana and Triticum aestivum, followed by the heterologous expression in Escherichia coli by two different strategies. Soluble expression of the Arabidopsis enzyme in the pET32c+ vector required a chaperone co-expression system (pGro7). The system using E. coli BL21-CodonPlus cells and the pRSETB vector was successful for expression of a soluble His(6)-taged recombinant wheat enzyme producing 2.5 mg of electrophoretically pure protein per liter of cell culture after a single chromatographic purification step. Both systems were effective for the expression of functional plant np-Ga3PDHases, however the expression of the Arabidopsis enzyme in pRSETB was affordable but not as optimal as for the wheat protein. This would be associated with a different codon usage preference between this specific plant and E. coli. Considering the relevant role played by np-Ga3PDHase in plant metabolism, it is experimentally valuable the development of a procedure to obtain adequate amounts of highly purified enzyme, which envisages the viability to perform studies of structure-to-function relationships to better understand the enzyme kinetics and regulation, as well as carbon and energy metabolism in higher plants."

"21597961","abstracttext","MYB transcription factors play diverse roles in plant growth, developmental processes and stress responses. A full-length cDNA sequence of a MYB gene, namely TaPIMP1, was isolated from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The TaPIMP1 transcript level was significantly up-regulated by inoculation with a fungal pathogen Bipolaris sorokiniana and by drought treatment. TaPIMP1 encodes the MYB protein TaPIMP1 consisting of 323 amino acids. TaPIMP1 contains two MYB DNA binding domains (R2, R3), two putative nuclear localization sites and two putative transcription activation domains. TaPIMP1 is a new member of the R2R3-MYB transcription factor subfamily. Transient expression in onion epidermal cells of GFP fused with TaPIMP1 proved that subcellular localization of TaPIMP1 occurred in the nucleus. The TaPIMP1 gene was transferred into tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) cultivar W38 by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. After screening through PCR and RT-PCR analyses, transgenic tobacco lines expressing TaPIMP1 were identified and evaluated for pathogen resistance, and drought and salt tolerance. Compared to untransformed tobacco host plants, TaPIMP1 expressing plants displayed significantly enhanced resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum and exhibited improved tolerances to drought and salt stresses. In these transgenic lines, the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were significantly increased relative to wild-type tobacco plants. The results suggested that the wheat R2R3-MYB transcription factor plays an important role in modulating responses to biotic and abiotic stresses."
"22791303","articletitle","Inhibition of tiller bud outgrowth in the tin mutant of wheat is associated with precocious internode development."
"22791303","abstracttext","Tillering (branching) is a major yield component and, therefore, a target for improving the yield of crops. However, tillering is regulated by complex interactions of endogenous and environmental signals, and the knowledge required to achieve optimal tiller number through genetic and agronomic means is still lacking. Regulatory mechanisms may be revealed through physiological and molecular characterization of naturally occurring and induced tillering mutants in the major crops. Here we characterize a reduced tillering (tin, for tiller inhibition) mutant of wheat (Triticum aestivum). The reduced tillering in tin is due to early cessation of tiller bud outgrowth during the transition of the shoot apex from the vegetative to the reproductive stage. There was no observed difference in the development of the main stem shoot apex between tin and the wild type. However, tin initiated internode development earlier and, unlike the wild type, the basal internodes in tin were solid rather than hollow. We hypothesize that tin represents a novel type of reduced tillering mutant associated with precocious internode elongation that diverts sucrose (Suc) away from developing tillers. Consistent with this hypothesis, we have observed upregulation of a gene induced by Suc starvation, downregulation of a Suc-inducible gene, and a reduced Suc content in dormant tin buds. The increased expression of the wheat Dormancy-associated (DRM1-like) and Teosinte Branched1 (TB1-like) genes and the reduced expression of cell cycle genes also indicate bud dormancy in tin. These results highlight the significance of Suc in shoot branching and the possibility of optimizing tillering by manipulating the timing of internode elongation."

"19304997","abstracttext_background","In arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) play key roles in regulating seasonal flowering-responses to synchronize flowering with optimal conditions. FT is a promoter of flowering activated by long days and by warm conditions. FLC represses FT to delay flowering until plants experience winter."
"19304997","abstracttext_scope","The identification of genes controlling flowering in cereals allows comparison of the molecular pathways controlling seasonal flowering-responses in cereals with those of arabidopsis. The role of FT has been conserved between arabidopsis and cereals; FT-like genes trigger flowering in response to short days in rice or long days in temperate cereals, such as wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). Many varieties of wheat and barley require vernalization to flower but FLC-like genes have not been identified in cereals. Instead, VERNALIZATION2 (VRN2) inhibits long-day induction of FT-like1 (FT1) prior to winter. VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) is activated by low-temperatures during winter to repress VRN2 and to allow the long-day response to occur in spring. In rice (Oryza sativa) a VRN2-like gene Ghd7, which influences grain number, plant height and heading date, represses the FT-like gene Heading date 3a (Hd3a) in long days, suggesting a broader role for VRN2-like genes in regulating day-length responses in cereals. Other genes, including Early heading date (Ehd1), Oryza sativa MADS51 (OsMADS51) and INDETERMINATE1 (OsID1) up-regulate Hd3a in short days. These genes might account for the different day-length response of rice compared with the temperate cereals. No genes homologous to VRN2, Ehd1, Ehd2 or OsMADS51 occur in arabidopsis."
"19304997","abstracttext_conclusions","It seems that different genes regulate FT orthologues to elicit seasonal flowering-responses in arabidopsis and the cereals. This highlights the need for more detailed study into the molecular basis of seasonal flowering-responses in cereal crops or in closely related model plants such as Brachypodium distachyon."

"21040302","abstracttext","In an attempt to shed light on the role of root systems in differential responses of wheat genotypes to long-term water limitation, transcriptional differences between two wheat genotypes (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Plainsman V and landrace Kobomugi) were identified during adaptation to moderate water stress at the tillering stage. Differences in organ sizes, water-use efficiency and seed production were detected in plants grown in soil, and root functions were characterised by expression profiling. The molecular genetic background of the behaviour of the two genotypes during this stress was revealed using a cDNA macroarray for transcript profiling of the roots. During a 4-week period of moderate water deficit, a set of up-regulated genes displaying transiently increased expression was identified in young plantlets, mostly in the second week in the roots of Kobomugi, while transcript levels remained constantly high in roots of Plainsman V. These genes encode proteins with various functions, such as transport, protein metabolism, osmoprotectant biosynthesis, cell wall biogenesis and detoxification, and also regulatory proteins. Oxidoreductases, peroxidases and cell wall-related genes were induced significantly only in Plainsman V, while induction of stress- and defence-related genes was more pronounced in Kobomugi. Real-time qPCR analysis of selected members of the glutathione S-transferase gene family revealed differences in regulation of family members in the two genotypes and confirmed the macroarray results. The TaGSTZ gene was stress-activated only in the roots of Kobomugi."

"21161258","abstracttext","In bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), initial studies using deletion lines indicated that crossover (CO) events occur mainly in the telomeric regions of the chromosomes with a possible correlation with the presence of genes. However, little is known about the distribution of COs at the sequence level. To investigate this, we studied in detail the pattern of COs along a contig of 3.110 Mb using two F2 segregating populations (Chinese Spring × Renan (F2-CsRe) and Chinese Spring × Courtot (F2-CsCt)) each containing ~2,000 individuals. The availability of the sequence of the contig from Cs enabled the development of 318 markers among which 23 co-dominant polymorphic markers (11 SSRs and 12 SNPs) were selected for CO distribution analyses. The distribution of CO events was not homogeneous throughout the contig, ranging from 0.05 to 2.77 cM/Mb, but was conserved between the two populations despite very different contig recombination rate averages (0.82 cM/Mb in F2-CsRe vs 0.35 cM/Mb in F2-CsCt). The CO frequency was correlated with the percentage of coding sequence in Cs and with the polymorphism rate between Cs and Re or Ct in both populations, indicating an impact of these two factors on CO distribution. At a finer scale, COs were found in a region covering 2.38 kb, spanning a gene coding for a glycosyl transferase (Hga3), suggesting the presence of a CO hotspot. A non-crossover event covering at least 453 bp was also identified in the same interval. From these results, we can conclude that gene content could be one of the factors driving recombination in bread wheat."

Here, we report the initial characterization and mapping of 23 PR-1-like (TaPr-1) genes in hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), which possesses one of the largest (>16,000 megabases) genomes among monocot crop plants. Sequence analysis revealed that the 23 TaPr-1 genes all contain intron-free open reading frames that encode a signal peptide at the N-terminus and a conserved PR-1-like domain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that TaPr-1 genes form three major monophyletic groups along with their counterparts in other monocots; each group consists of genes encoding basic, basic with a C-terminal extension, and acidic PR-1 proteins, respectively, suggesting diversity and conservation of PR-1 gene functions in monocot plants. Mapping analysis assisted by untranslated region-specified discrimination (USD) markers and various cytogenetic stocks located the 23 TaPr-1 genes to seven different chromosomes, with the majority mapping to chromosomes of homoeologous groups 5 and 7. Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis revealed that 12 TaPr-1 genes were induced or up-regulated upon pathogen challenge. Together, this study provides insights to the origin, evolution, homoeologous relationships, and expression patterns of the TaPr-1 genes. The data presented provide critical information for further genome-wide characterization of the wheat PR-1 gene family and the USD markers developed will facilitate genetic and functional analysis of PR-1 genes associated with plant defense and/or other important traits."

Xylanases are digestive enzymes responsible for the degradation of xylan based polymers, hydrolyzing them into smaller molecules that are easier to assimilate by insects. We report the cloning, expression and enzymatic characterization of a xylanase gene that was identified in the digestive tract of the coffee berry borer."

The xylanase activity and XIP-I inhibitory activity was quantified by the 3,5-dinitrosalicylic (DNS).

"23192388","abstracttext","Intracellular signaling pathways between the mitochondria and the nucleus are important in both normal and abnormal development in plants. The homeotic transformation of stamens into pistil-like structures (a phenomenon termed pistillody) in cytoplasmic substitution (alloplasmic) lines of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) has been suggested to be induced by mitochondrial retrograde signaling, one of the forms of intracellular communication. We showed previously that the mitochondrial gene orf260 could alter the expression of nuclear class B MADS-box genes to induce pistillody. To elucidate the interactions between orf260 and nuclear homeotic genes, we performed a microarray analysis to compare gene expression patterns in the young spikes of a pistillody line and a normal line. We identified five genes that showed higher expression levels in the pistillody line. Quantitative expression analysis using real-time PCR indicated that among these five genes, Wheat Calmodulin-Binding Protein 1 (WCBP1) was significantly upregulated in young spikes of the pistillody line. The amino acid sequence of WCBP1 was predicted from the full-length cDNA sequence and found to encode a novel plant calmodulin-binding protein. RT-PCR analysis indicated that WCBP1 was preferentially expressed in young spikes at an early stage and decreased during spike maturation, indicating that it was associated with spikelet/floret development. Furthermore, in situ hybridization analysis suggested that WCBP1 was highly expressed in the pistil-like stamens at early to late developmental stages. These results indicate that WCBP1 plays a role in formation and development of pistil-like stamens induced by mitochondrial retrograde signaling."

"23702247","abstracttext","Changes in water potential (ψw), stomatal conductance, abscisic acid (ABA) accumulation, expression of the major genes involved in ABA biosynthesis, activities of abscisic aldehyde oxidase (AO, EC 1.2.3.1) and antioxidant enzymes were studied in two wheat cultivars with contrasting acclimation strategies subjected to medium strength osmotic stress (-0.976MPa) induced by polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000). Because the biosynthetic pathway of ABA involves multiple gene products, the aim of this study was to unravel how these genes are regulated in isohydric and anisohydric wheat genotypes. In the root tissues of the isohydric cultivar, Triticum aestivum cv. Kobomugi, osmotic stress increased the transcript levels of 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase (NCED) gene, controlling the rate limiting step of ABA biosynthesis. Moreover, this cultivar exhibited a higher basal activity and a higher induction of aldehyde oxidase isoenzymes (AAO2-AAO3), responsible for converting ABAldehyde to ABA. It was found that the fast activation of the ABA biosynthesis in the roots generated an enhanced ABA pool in the shoot, which brought about a faster closure of the stomata upon increasing osmotic stress and, as a result, the plants could maintain ψw in the tissues close to the control level. In contrast, the anisohydric genotype, cv. GK Öthalom, exhibited a moderate induction of ABA biosynthesis in the roots, leading to the maintenance but no increase in the concentration of ABA on the basis of tissue water content in the leaves. Due to the slower response of their stomata to water deficit, the tissues of cv. GK Öthalom have to acclimate to much more negative water potentials during increasing osmotic stress. A decreased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) was found in the leaves and roots of both cultivars exposed to osmotic stress, but in the roots elevated activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POX), glutathione reductase (GR) and glutathione transferase (GST) were detected in the isohydric cultivar, suggesting that this genotype was more successful in the elimination of reactive oxygen species caused by the stress conditions."
"24445300","articletitle","Manipulation of monoubiquitin improves chilling tolerance in transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)."
"24445300","abstracttext","Ubiquitin (Ub) is a multifunctional protein that mainly functions to tag proteins for selective degradation by the 26S proteasome. We cloned an Ub gene TaUb2 from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) previously. To study the function of TaUB2 in chilling stress, sense and antisense Ub transgenic tobacco plants (Nicotiana tabacum L.), as well as wild type (WT) and vector control β-glucuronidase (T-GUS) plants, were used. Under stress, leaf wilting in sense plants was significantly less than in controls, but more severe in antisense plants. Meanwhile, the net photosynthetic rate (Pn) and the maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) in sense plants were greater than controls, but lower in antisense plants during chilling stress and recovery. Less wilting in sense plants resulted from improved water status, which may be related to the accumulation of proline and solute sugar. Furthermore, as indicated by electrolyte leakage, membrane damage under stress was less in sense plants and more severe in antisense plants than controls. Consistent with electrolyte leakage, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content was less in sense plants, but more in antisense plants compared to controls. Meanwhile, the less accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the greater antioxidant enzyme activity in sense plants implied the improved antioxidant competence by the overexpression of monoubiquitin gene Ta-Ub2 from wheat. We suggest that overexpressing Ub is a useful strategy to promote chilling tolerance. The improvement of ROS scavenging may be an important mechanism underlying the role of Ub in promoting plants tolerant to chilling stress."
"24308988","articletitle","Multiple heat priming enhances thermo-tolerance to a later high temperature stress via improving subcellular antioxidant activities in wheat seedlings."
"24308988","abstracttext","Seedlings of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were firstly twice heat-primed at 32/24 °C, and subsequently subjected to a more severe high temperature stress at 35/27 °C. The later high temperature stress significantly decreased plant biomass and leaf total soluble sugars concentration. However, plants experienced priming (PH) up-regulated the Rubisco activase B encoding gene RcaB, which was in accordance with the higher photosynthesis rate in relation to the non-primed plants (NH) under the later high temperature stress. In relation to NH, the major chlorophyll a/b-binding protein gene Cab was down-regulated in PH plants, implying a reduction of the light absorption to protect the photosystem II from excitation energy under high temperature stress. At the same time, under the later high temperature stress PH plants showed significantly higher actual photochemical efficiency, indicating an improvement of light use efficiency due to the priming pre-treatment. Under the later high temperature stress, PH could be maintained a better redox homeostasis than NH, as exemplified by the higher activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in chloroplasts and glutathione reductase (GR), and of peroxidase (POD) in mitochondria, which contributed to the lower superoxide radical production rate and malondialdehyde concentration in both chloroplasts and mitochondria. The improved antioxidant capacity in chloroplasts and mitochondria was related to the up-regulated expressions of Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD and GR in PH. Collectively, heat priming effectively improved thermo-tolerance of wheat seedlings subjected to a later high temperature stress, which could be largely ascribed to the enhanced anti-oxidation at the subcellular level."

"24705986","abstracttext","Phospholipase D (PLD) is crucial for plant responses to stress and signal transduction, however, the regulatory mechanism of PLD in abiotic stress is not completely understood; especially, in crops. In this study, we isolated a gene, TaPLDα, from common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Analysis of the amino acid sequence of TaPLDα revealed a highly conserved C2 domain and two characteristic HKD motifs, which is similar to other known PLD family genes. Further characterization revealed that TaPLDα expressed differentially in various organs, such as roots, stems, leaves and spikelets of wheat. After treatment with abscisic acid (ABA), methyl jasmonate, dehydration, polyethylene glycol and NaCl, the expression of TaPLDα was up-regulated in shoots. Subsequently, we generated TaPLDα-overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis lines under the control of the dexamethasone-inducible 35S promoter. The overexpression of TaPLDα in Arabidopsis resulted in significantly enhanced tolerance to drought, as shown by reduced chlorosis and leaf water loss, higher relative water content and lower relative electrolyte leakage than the wild type. Moreover, the TaPLDα-overexpressing plants exhibited longer roots in response to mannitol treatment. In addition, the seeds of TaPLDα-overexpressing plants showed hypersensitivity to ABA and osmotic stress. Under dehydration, the expression of several stress-related genes, RD29A, RD29B, KIN1 and RAB18, was up-regulated to a higher level in TaPLDα-overexpressing plants than in wild type. Taken together, our results indicated that TaPLDα can enhance tolerance to drought and osmotic stress in Arabidopsis and represents a potential candidate gene to enhance stress tolerance in crops."

"26313966","abstracttext","Gall-inducing insects are known for altering source-sink relationships within plants. Changes in photosynthesis may contribute to this phenomenon. We investigated photosynthetic responses in wheat [Triticum aestivum L. (Poaceae: Triticeae)] seedlings attacked by the Hessian fly [Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae], which uses a salivary effector-based strategy to induce a gall nutritive tissue in susceptible plants. Resistant plants have surveillance systems mediated by products of Resistance (R) genes. Detection of a specific salivary effector triggers downstream responses that result in a resistance that kills neonate larvae. A 2 × 2 factorial design was used to study maximum leaf photosynthetic assimilation and stomatal conductance rates. The plant treatments were-resistant or susceptible wheat lines expressing or not expressing the H13 resistance gene. The insect treatments were-no attack (control) or attack by larvae killed by H13 gene-mediated resistance. Photosynthesis was measured for the second and third leaves of the seedling, the latter being the only leaf directly attacked by larvae. We predicted effector-based attack would trigger increases in photosynthetic rates in susceptible but not resistant plants. For susceptible plants, attack was associated with increases (relative to controls) in photosynthesis for the third but not the second leaf. For resistant plants, attack was associated with increases in photosynthesis for both the second and third leaves. Mechanisms underlying the increases appeared to differ. Resistant plants exhibited responses suggesting altered source-sink relationships. Susceptible plants exhibited responses suggesting a mechanism other than altered source-sink relationships, possibly changes in water relations that contributed to increased stomatal conductance."

Irradiation can induce translocations and deletions to assist physically locating genes and markers on chromosomes. In this study, a 12-Gy dosage of (60)Co-γ was applied to pollen and eggs of a wheat (Triticum aestivum) landrace Chinese Spring (CS)-Thinopyrum bessarabicum chromosome 4J disomic addition line (DA4J), and the gametes from irradiated plants were fertilized with normal CS eggs or pollen to produce M1 seeds. Based on genomic in situ hybridization analysis of 261 M1 plants, we identified 74 lines carrying structural aberrations involving chromosome 4J with the higher aberration rate in treated pollen (31.2 %) than in the treated eggs (21.3 %). We further identified 43 (53.8 %) lines with structural aberrations on chromosome 4J by analyzing another 80 M1 plants with 74 4J-specific markers, indicating that combining molecular and cytological methods was more efficient for detecting chromosome aberrations. Marker analysis thus was performed prior to cytogenetic identification on M2-M4 seeds to detect chromosome structural aberrations. Sixty-eight M3 lines with structural aberrations on chromosome 4J and six previously obtained chromosome 4J alien lines were then analyzed using 101 chromosome 4J-specific markers. After combining marker results with chromosome aberrations in each line, chromosome 4J was physically divided into 24 segmental blocks with 7 in the short arm and 17 in the long arm. The blue-grained gene BaThb was further mapped into the region corresponding to block 4JL-11. The chromosome aberrations and the physical map developed in this research provide useful stocks and tools for introgression of genes on chromosome 4J into wheat."

"26848576","abstracttext","Wheat heading date is an important agronomic trait determining maturation time and yield. A set of common wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Chinese Spring; CS)-wild emmer (T. turgidum L. subsp. dicoccoides (TDIC)) chromosome arm substitution lines (CASLs) was used to identify and allocate QTLs conferring late or early spike emergence by examining heading date. Genetic loci accelerating heading were found on TDIC chromosome arms 3AL and 7BS, while loci delaying heading were located on 4AL and 2BS. To map QTLs conferring late heading on 2BS, F2 populations derived from two cross combinations of CASL2BS × CS and CASL3AL × CASL2BS were developed and each planted at two times, constituting four F2 mapping populations. Heading date varied continuously among individuals of these four populations, suggesting quantitative characteristics. A genetic map of 2BS, consisting of 23 SSR and one single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) marker(s), was constructed using these F2 populations. This map spanned a genetic length of 53.2 cM with average marker density of 2.3 cM. The photoperiod-sensitivity gene Ppd-B1 was mapped to chromosome arm 2BS as a SSCP molecular marker, and was validated as tightly linked to a major QTL governing late heading of CASL2BS in all mapping populations. A significant dominance by additive effect of Ppd-B1 with the LUX gene located on 3AL was also detected. CS had more copies of Ppd-B1 than CASL2BS, implying that increased copy number could elevate the expression of Ppd-1 in CS, also increasing expression of LUX and FT genes and causing CS to have an earlier heading date than CASL2BS in long days."

"26505350","abstracttext","Although a number of studies have shown that chemical hybridizing agents (CHAs) affect anther growth and regulate cell-cycle progression, little is known about the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is an essential factor in DNA replication, and in many other processes in eukaryotic cells. In this study, the open reading frame of TaPCNA, the PCNA in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), was cloned by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Sequence analysis revealed that this gene was 792-bp long and encoded a protein with 234 amino acids. Alignment of the TaPCNA-predicted sequence revealed a high degree of identity with PCNAs from other plant species. A subcellular localization assay indicated that TaPCNA was localized in the nucleus. The TaPCNA was cloned into the prokaryotic expression plasmid pET32a, and the recombinant plasmid was transformed into BL21 (DE3). TaPCNA expression was induced by 0.5 mM isopropyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside and verified using sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot assays, which indicated that the fusion protein was successfully expressed. The gene involved in the G1-to-S transition, Histone H4, was downregulated by 1376- CIMS, which is a chemically induced male sterility line. However, a semi-quantitative RT-PCR revealed that TaPCNA expression was upregulated in 1376-CIMS. Our results suggest that CHAs (SQ-1) induce DNA damage in wheat anthers. DNA damage results in either the delay or arrest of cell-cycle progression, which affects anther development. This study will help to elucidate the mechanisms of SQ-1-induced male sterility."

To investigate tolerant mechanisms involved in the salt and drought responses, expression of related marker genes analyses were conducted, and related physiological indices were also measured. Expressions of genes were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)."
"26536863","abstracttext_results","A novel NAC transcription factor gene, designated TaNAC29, was isolated from bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Sequence alignment suggested that TaNAC29 might be located on chromosome 2BS. TaNAC29 was localized to the nucleus in wheat protoplasts, and proved to have transcriptional activation activities in yeast. TaNAC29 was expressed at a higher level in the leaves, and expression levels were much higher in senescent leaves, indicating that TaNAC29 might be involved in the senescence process. TaNAC29 transcripts were increased following treatments with salt, PEG6000, H2O2, and abscisic acid (ABA). To examine TaNAC29 function, transgenic Arabidopsis plants overexpressing TaNAC29 were generated. Germination and root length assays of transgenic plants demonstrated that TaNAC29 overexpression plants had enhanced tolerances to high salinity and dehydration, and exhibited an ABA-hypersensitive response. When grown in the greenhouse, TaNAC29-overexpression plants showed the same tolerance response to salt and drought stresses at both the vegetative and reproductive period, and had delayed bolting and flowering in the reproductive period. Moreover, TaNAC29 overexpression plants accumulated lesser malondialdehyde (MDA), H2O2, while had higher superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities under high salinity and/or dehydration stress."

"27229732","articletitle","Overexpression of wheat gene TaMOR improves root system architecture and grain yield in Oryza sativa."
"27229732","abstracttext","Improved root architecture is an effective strategy to increase crop yield. We demonstrate that overexpression of transcription factor gene MORE ROOT (TaMOR) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) results in more roots and higher grain yield in rice (Oryza sativa). TaMOR, encoding a plant-specific transcription factor belonging to the ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2/LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES (AS2/LOB) protein family, is highly conserved in wheat and its wild relatives. In this study, tissue expression patterns indicated that TaMOR mainly localizes to root initiation sites. The consistent gene expression pattern suggests that TaMOR is involved in root initiation. Exogenous auxin treatment induced TaMOR expression without de novo protein biosynthesis. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that TaMOR interacts with TaMOR-related protein TaMRRP, which contains a four-tandem-pentatricopeptide repeat motif. Overexpression of TaMOR led to more lateral roots in Arabidopsis thaliana, and TaMOR-overexpressing rice plants had more crown roots, a longer main panicle, a higher number of primary branches on the main panicle, a higher grain number per plant, and higher yield per plant than the plants of wild type. In general, TaMOR-D-overexpressing lines had larger root systems in Arabidopsis and rice, and produce a higher grain yield per plant. TaMOR therefore offers an opportunity to improve root architecture and increase yield in crop plants."
"29379512","articletitle","Genomic, Biochemical, and Modeling Analyses of Asparagine Synthetases from Wheat."
"29379512","abstracttext","Asparagine synthetase activity in cereals has become an important issue with the discovery that free asparagine concentration determines the potential for formation of acrylamide, a probably carcinogenic processing contaminant, in baked cereal products. Asparagine synthetase catalyses the ATP-dependent transfer of the amino group of glutamine to a molecule of aspartate to generate glutamate and asparagine. Here, asparagine synthetase-encoding polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were amplified from wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) cv. Spark cDNA. The encoded proteins were assigned the names TaASN1, TaASN2, and TaASN3 on the basis of comparisons with other wheat and cereal asparagine synthetases. Although very similar to each other they differed slightly in size, with molecular masses of 65.49, 65.06, and 66.24 kDa, respectively. Chromosomal positions and scaffold references were established for TaASN1, TaASN2 , and TaASN3 , and a fourth, more recently identified gene, TaASN4 . TaASN1, TaASN2 , and TaASN4 were all found to be single copy genes, located on chromosomes 5, 3, and 4, respectively, of each genome (A, B, and D), although variety Chinese Spring lacked a TaASN2 gene in the B genome. Two copies of TaASN3 were found on chromosome 1 of each genome, and these were given the names TaASN3.1 and TaASN3.2 . The TaASN1, TaASN2, and TaASN3 PCR products were heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli ( TaASN4 was not investigated in this part of the study). Western blot analysis identified two monoclonal antibodies that recognized the three proteins, but did not distinguish between them, despite being raised to epitopes SKKPRMIEVAAP and GGSNKPGVMNTV in the variable C-terminal regions of the proteins. The heterologously expressed TaASN1 and TaASN2 proteins were found to be active asparagine synthetases, producing asparagine and glutamate from glutamine and aspartate. The asparagine synthetase reaction was modeled using SNOOPY ® software and information from the BRENDA database to generate differential equations to describe the reaction stages, based on mass action kinetics. Experimental data from the reactions catalyzed by TaASN1 and TaASN2 were entered into the model using Copasi, enabling values to be determined for kinetic parameters. Both the reaction data and the modeling showed that the enzymes continued to produce glutamate even when the synthesis of asparagine had ceased due to a lack of aspartate."

"29020037","abstracttext","Pathogenic fungi must extend filamentous hyphae across solid surfaces to cause diseases of plants. However, the full inventory of genes which support this is incomplete and many may be currently concealed due to their essentiality for the hyphal growth form. During a random T-DNA mutagenesis screen performed on the pleomorphic wheat (Triticum aestivum) pathogen Zymoseptoria tritici, we acquired a mutant unable to extend hyphae specifically when on solid surfaces. In contrast ""yeast-like"" growth, and all other growth forms, were unaffected. The inability to extend surface hyphae resulted in a complete loss of virulence on plants. The affected gene encoded a predicted type 2 glycosyltransferase (ZtGT2). Analysis of >800 genomes from taxonomically diverse fungi highlighted a generally widespread, but discontinuous, distribution of ZtGT2 orthologues, and a complete absence of any similar proteins in non-filamentous ascomycete yeasts. Deletion mutants of the ZtGT2 orthologue in the taxonomically un-related fungus Fusarium graminearum were also severely impaired in hyphal growth and non-pathogenic on wheat ears. ZtGT2 expression increased during filamentous growth and electron microscopy on deletion mutants (ΔZtGT2) suggested the protein functions to maintain the outermost surface of the fungal cell wall. Despite this, adhesion to leaf surfaces was unaffected in ΔZtGT2 mutants and global RNAseq-based gene expression profiling highlighted that surface-sensing and protein secretion was also largely unaffected. However, ΔZtGT2 mutants constitutively overexpressed several transmembrane and secreted proteins, including an important LysM-domain chitin-binding virulence effector, Zt3LysM. ZtGT2 likely functions in the synthesis of a currently unknown, potentially minor but widespread, extracellular or outer cell wall polysaccharide which plays a key role in facilitating many interactions between plants and fungi by enabling hyphal growth on solid matrices."

"29720988","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNA) families act as critical regulators for plant growth, development, and responses to abiotic stresses. In this study, we characterized TaemiR408, a miRNA family member of wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), for the role in mediating plant responses to Pi starvation and salt stress. TaemiR408 targets six genes that encode proteins involving biochemical metabolism, microtubule organization, and signaling transduction. 5'- and 3'-RACE analyses confirmed the mRNA cleavage of target genes mediated by this wheat miRNA. TaemiR408 showed induced expression patterns upon Pi starvation and salt stress and whose upregulated expression was gradually repressed by the normal recovery treatments. The target genes of TaemiR408 exhibited reverse expression patterns to this miRNA, whose transcripts were downregulated under Pi starvation and salt stress and the reduced expression was recovered by the followed normal condition. These results suggest the regulation of the target genes under TaemiR408 through a cleavage mechanism. Tobacco lines with TaemiR408 overexpression exhibited enhanced stress tolerance, showing improved phenotype, biomass, and photosynthesis behavior compared with wild type under both Pi starvation and salt treatments, which closely associate increased P accumulation upon Pi deprivation and elevated osmolytes under salt stress, respectively. Phosphate transporter (PT) gene NtPT2 displays upregulated transcripts in the Pi-deprived TaemiR408 overexpressors; knockdown of this PT gene reduces Pi acquisition under low-Pi stress, confirming its role in improving plant Pi taken up. Likewise, NtPYL2 and NtSAPK3 , genes encoding abscisic acid (ABA) receptor and SnRK2 protein, respectively, exhibited upregulated transcripts in salt-challenged TaemiR408 overexpressors; knockdown of them caused deteriorated growth and lowered osmolytes amounts of plants upon salt treatment. Thus, TaemiR408 is crucial for plant adaptations to Pi starvation and salt stress through regulating Pi acquisition under low-Pi stress and remodel ABA signaling pathway and osmoprotects biosynthesis under salt stress."

Nullisomic-tetrasomic (nulli-tetra or NT) lines are aneuploid wheat plants lacking two and adding two of six homoeologous chromosomes. These plants can grow normally, but with significantly morphological variations because the adding two chromosomes or the remaining four chromosomes compensate for those absent. Despite these interesting phenomena, detailed molecular mechanisms underlying dosage deletion and compensation in these useful genetic materials have not been determined."
"30630423","abstracttext_results","By sequencing the transcriptomes of leaves in two-week-old seedlings, we showed that the profiles of differentially expressed genes between NT stocks for homoeologous group 7 and the parent hexaploid Chinese Spring (CS) occurred throughout the whole genome with a subgenome and chromosome preference. The deletion effect of nulli-chromosomes was compensated partly by the tetra-chromosomes via the dose level of expressed genes, according to the types of homoeologous genes. The functions of differentially regulated genes primarily focused on carbon metabolic process, photosynthesis process, hormone metabolism, and responding to stimulus, and etc., which might be related to the defective phenotypes that included reductions in plant height, flag leaf length, spikelet number, and kernels per spike."

"32627139","abstracttext","Grain development of Triticum aestivum is being studied extensively using individual OMICS tools. However, integrated transcriptome and proteome studies are limited mainly due to complexity of genome. Current study focused to unravel the transcriptome-proteome coordination of key mechanisms underlying carbohydrate metabolism during whole wheat grain development. Wheat grains were manually dissected to obtain grain tissues for proteomics and transcriptomics analyses. Differentially expressed proteins and transcripts at the 11 stages of grain development were compared. Computational workflow for integration of two datasets related to carbohydrate metabolism was designed. For CM proteins, output peptide sequences of proteomic analyses (via LC-MS/MS) were used as source to search corresponding transcripts. The transcript that turned out with higher number of peptides was selected as bona fide ribonucleotide sequence for respective protein synthesis. More than 90% of hits resulted in successful identification of respective transcripts. Comparative analysis of protein and transcript expression profiles resulted in overall 32% concordance between these two series of data. However, during grain development correlation of two datasets gradually increased up to ~ tenfold from 152 to 655 °Cd and then dropped down. Proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism were divided in five categories in accordance with their functions. Enzymes involved in starch and sucrose biosynthesis showed the highest correlations between proteome-transcriptome profiles. High percentage of identification and validation of protein-transcript hits highlighted the power of omics data integration approach over existing gene functional annotation tools. We found that correlation of two datasets is highly influenced by stage of grain development. Further, gene regulatory networks would be helpful in unraveling the mechanisms underlying the complex and significant traits such as grain weight and yield."

"32688741","abstracttext","The winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) producing region of the US Pacific Northwest (PNW) is often subject to water deficits at sowing and during grain filling. Improved genetic adaptation of wheat cultivars to drought stress is one objective of breeding efforts in the region. Consequently, there is interest in identifying molecular markers associated with drought tolerance. Dehydrins, a family of proteins that accumulate in response to dehydrative stress, may provide a suitable marker for use in breeding programs. Seven cultivars (Connie, Gene, TAM105, Rod, Hiller, Rhode and Stephens) were evaluated in two experiments in which dehydrin accumulation and their association to stress tolerance during grain filling were characterized during progressive drought stress. A24-kDa dehydrin was present in leaves at each sampling date in all seven cultivars. Quantitative differences in accumulation of this protein were observed between cultivars on the third sampling date (4 d of stress). This differential accumulation was associated with stress tolerance characterized by a lower yield reduction and a lowered rate of decrease in leaf water potential in Connie, TAM105 and Gene. In contrast to leaves, an increased number of dehydrins were observed in grains under stress and non-stress treatments. Despite the number of dehydrins detected, there was no apparent association between drought stress and dehydrin expression in grains. Although the specific role of these proteins remains unknown, their association with stress tolerance suggests that dehydrins have utility in improving adaptation to drought and as markers for drought tolerance."

"15815925","abstracttext","Host-plant resistance is the most economically viable and environmentally responsible method of control for Puccinia triticina, the causal agent of leaf rust in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The identification and utilization of new resistance sources is critical to the continued development of improved cultivars as shifts in pathogen races cause the effectiveness of widely deployed genes to be short lived. The objectives of this research were to identify and tag new leaf rust resistance genes. Forty landraces from Afghanistan and Iran were obtained from the National Plant Germplasm System and evaluated under field conditions at two locations in Texas. PI 289824, a landrace from Iran, was highly resistant under field infection. Further evaluation revealed that PI 289824 is highly resistant to a broad spectrum of leaf rust races, including the currently prevalent races of leaf rust in the Great Plains area of the USA. Eight F1 plants, 176 F2 individuals and 139 F2:3 families of a cross between PI 289824 and T112 (susceptible) were evaluated for resistance to leaf rust at the seedling stage. Genetic analysis indicated resistance in PI 289824 is controlled by a single dominant gene. The AFLP analyses resulted in the identification of a marker (P39 M48-367) linked to resistance. The diagnostic AFLP band was sequenced and that sequence information was used to develop an STS marker (TXW200) linked to the gene at a distance of 2.3 cM. The addition of microsatellite markers allowed the gene to be mapped to the short arm of Chromosome 5B. The only resistance gene to be assigned to Chr 5BS is Lr52. The Lr52 gene was reported to be 16.5 cM distal to Xgwm443 while the gene in PI 289824 mapped 16.7 cM proximal to Xgwm443. Allelism tests are needed to determine the relationship between the gene in PI 289824 and Lr52. If the reported map positions are correct, the gene in PI 289824 is unique."

"8200513","abstracttext","Crosses between Triticum timopheevi, as maternal donor, and T. aestivum can lead to cytoplasmic male sterile (cms) plants. The T. timopheevi derived mitochondrial DNA from parental, cms, and fertility-restored lines differs from that of T. aestivum derived mtDNA in the coxI gene region. Our previous results for cms lines showed that there is an open reading frame, orf256, upstream from coxI in T. timopheevi derived mtDNA that is not present in T. aestivum DNA. The 5' flanking region and the first 33 nucleotides of the coding region of orf256 are identical to the corresponding region of T. aestivum coxI, whereas the rest of orf256, including the 3' flank, is not related to coxI. Also, the organization of orf256 and coxI on a HindIII fragment from T. timopheevi derived mtDNA are identical in T. timopheevi, cms, and fertility-restored lines. We now report that the DNA sequence of orf256 is identical in T. timopheevi, cms, and fertility-restored lines. Major transcripts in cms and fertility-restored lines encode both orf256 and coxI with 5' termini like coxI mRNA of T. aestivum, whereas parental mitochondria from T. timopheevi have major transcripts with 5' termini within the orf256 coding region. Mitochondria from cms and fertility-restored lines have the potential to produce a protein that would not be present in parental T. timopheevi or in T. aestivum."

"22857656","abstracttext_background","Fusarium head blight (FHB) caused by Fusarium species like F. graminearum is a devastating disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol produced by the fungus affect plant and animal health, and cause significant reductions of grain yield and quality. Resistant varieties are the only effective way to control this disease, but the molecular events leading to FHB resistance are still poorly understood. Transcriptional profiling was conducted for the winter wheat cultivars Dream (moderately resistant) and Lynx (susceptible). The gene expressions at 32 and 72 h after inoculation with Fusarium were used to trace possible defence mechanisms and associated genes. A comparative qPCR was carried out for selected genes to analyse the respective expression patterns in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3 (Chinese spring wheat)."
"22857656","abstracttext_results","Among 2,169 differentially expressed genes, two putative main defence mechanisms were found in the FHB-resistant Dream cultivar. Both are defined base on their specific mode of resistance. A non-specific mechanism was based on several defence genes probably induced by jasmonate and ethylene signalling, including lipid-transfer protein, thionin, defensin and GDSL-like lipase genes. Additionally, defence-related genes encoding jasmonate-regulated proteins were up-regulated in response to FHB. Another mechanism based on the targeted suppression of essential Fusarium virulence factors comprising proteases and mycotoxins was found to be an essential, induced defence of general relevance in wheat. Moreover, similar inductions upon fungal infection were frequently observed among FHB-responsive genes of both mechanisms in the cultivars Dream and Sumai 3."
"22857656","abstracttext_conclusions","Especially ABC transporter, UDP-glucosyltransferase, protease and protease inhibitor genes associated with the defence mechanism against fungal virulence factors are apparently active in different resistant genetic backgrounds, according to reports on other wheat cultivars and barley. This was further supported in our qPCR experiments on seven genes originating from this mechanism which revealed similar activities in the resistant cultivars Dream and Sumai 3. Finally, the combination of early-stage and steady-state induction was associated with resistance, while transcript induction generally occurred later and temporarily in the susceptible cultivars. The respective mechanisms are attractive for advanced studies aiming at new resistance and toxin management strategies."

However, processing quality is very complex and controlled by many genes, which have not been completely explored. To identify the candidate genes whose expressions changed due to variation in processing quality and interaction (quality x development), genome-wide transcriptome studies were performed in two sets of diverse Indian wheat varieties differing for chapatti quality.

Many processing quality related key genes such as glutenin and gliadins, puroindolines, grain softness protein, alpha and beta amylases, proteases, were identified, and many other candidate genes related to cellular and molecular functions were also identified. The ANOVA analysis revealed that the expression of 56 of 110 probe sets was involved in interaction (quality x development). Majority of the probe sets showed differential expression at early stage of seed development i.e. temporal expression. Meta-analysis revealed that the majority of the genes expressed in one or a few growth stages indicating spatial distribution of their expressions.

Thus, they are appropriate tools to study the origin and evolution of polyploidy plant taxa. The plastid 3-phosphoglycerate kinase gene (Pgk-1) sequences from 44 accessions of Triticum and Aegilops, representing diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheats, were used to estimate the origin of Triticum petropavlovskyi. Our phylogenetic analysis was carried out on exon+intron, exon and intron sequences, using maximum likelihood, Bayesian inference and haplotype networking. We found the D genome sequences of Pgk-1 genes from T. petropavlovskyi are similar to the D genome orthologs in T. aestivum, while their relationship with Ae. tauschii is more distant. The A genome sequences of T. petropavlovskyi group with those of T. polonicum, but its Pgk-1 B genome sequences to some extent diverge from those of other species of Triticum. Our data do not support for the origin of T. petropavlovskyi either as an independent allopolyploidization event between Ae. tauschii and T. polonicum, or as a monomendelian mutation in T. aestivum. We suggest that T. petropavlovskyi originated via spontaneous introgression from T. polonicum into T. aestivum. The dating of divergence among T. polonicum, T. petropavlovskyi, T. carthlicum, T. turgidum, and T. compactum indicates an age of 0.78 million years [corrected]."

Both HvPUB15 and HvARM1 proteins interact in yeast and plant cells with the susceptibility-related, plastid-localized barley homologs of THF1 (for Thylakoid formation 1) and of ClpS1 (for Clp-protease adaptor S1) of Arabidopsis thaliana. A genome-wide scan for partial gene duplicates reveals further events in barley resulting in stress-regulated, potentially neo-functionalized, genes."
"30111359","abstracttext_conclusion","The results suggest neo-functionalization of the partial gene copy HvARM1 increases resistance against powdery mildew infection. It further links plastid function with susceptibility to biotrophic pathogen attack. These findings shed new light on a novel mechanism to employ partial duplication of protein-protein interaction domains to facilitate the expansion of immune signaling networks."
"30754222","articletitle","First Report of Virulence for the Wheat Leaf Rust (Puccinia triticina) Resistance Gene Lr32 in South Africa."
"30754222","abstracttext","The wheat leaf rust resistance gene Lr32 was transferred from Aegilops tauschii Coss. to bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (1). Despite virulence for Lr32 in some isolates from Bulgaria, Israel, and Turkey, the gene has been reported to be effective in Australia, Mexico, the United States, and South Africa (1,2). A leaf rust isolate that differed in its avirulence/virulence profile from previously recorded races of Puccinia triticina Eriks. in South Africa was collected from triticale (× Triticosecale) in the Western Cape in 2005. According to the South African leaf rust differential set (3), this isolate (UVPt19) was avirulent for Lr3a, 3bg, 3ka, 10, 11, 16, 20, 26, and 30 and virulent for Lr1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 14a, 15, 17, 24, and Thatcher (Tc, control). Except for Lr20 in cv. Thew, all differentials are Tc near-isogenic lines. In comparison with known South African races (3), it differed from race 3SA132 at the Lr10 locus. Using standard rust pathology protocols (3), an expanded set of Lr gene lines (non Tc lines indicated) showed that UVPt19 is avirulent on wheat seedlings containing Lr9, 19, 21, 25, 27+31 (Gatcher), 29, 36 (ER84018), 37, 41 (KS91WGRC10), 44, 45, 47 (KS90H450), 50 (KS96WGRC36), 51 (R05), and 52, and virulent for Lr12, 22a, 23, 28, 32, 33, and 35. In the seedling stage, UVPt19 was virulent for the temperature sensitive genes Lr13, 18, and 34 at 25°C, but produced lower infection types (ITs) on Lr18 and 34 at 14 to 18°C. Seedlings of Pavon 76 (Lr46) were resistant (IT ;1=) to UVPt19. The susceptible response of lines carrying Lr32 was confirmed by high ITs (3++4) on RL5713/2*Mq, RL6086 (TcLr32), and RL5713/2*Mq//6*Palmiet. A control isolate (UVPt9) produced ITs ;1+, ;1+, and ;;1= on these lines, respectively. UVPt19 was virulent on line RL6092 (TcLr20) but avirulent on Thew. When tested on adult plants of lines RL6011 (TcLr12), CT263 (TcLr13), RL6044 (TcLr22a), RL6058 (TcLr34), RL6082 (TcLr35), RL6081 (TcLr37), and Tc (control), UVPt19 was only virulent (IT 3+) on CT263 and Tc. Flag leaves of RL6011 (IT ;1), RL6044 (IT 1), RL6058 (IT Z3-), RL6082 (IT 0;), and RL6081 (IT ;1) were resistant. UVPt19 was virulent on seedlings of 11 of 13 triticale cultivars and lines tested as opposed to UVPt9, which was virulent to only one entry. From a collection of 105 South African bread wheat cultivars and elite breeding lines, UVPt19 was virulent on 13 and five were mixed in their response to this isolate. All IT experiments were repeated. Although virulence has emerged for Lr32 in South Africa, the gene has not been used in local cultivars. Previously, McIntosh et al. (1) also reported that Lr32 has not been exploited in wheat production. On the basis of current evidence, UVPt19 appears to be potentially more damaging to triticale than bread wheat. Furthermore, the race seems rare because it was not collected in a recent wheat leaf rust survey in South Africa (3). References: (1) R. A. McIntosh et al.

"25870924","abstracttext","A single gene for resistance, designated Rmg7 (Resistance to Magnaporthe grisea 7), was identified in a tetraploid wheat accession, St24 (Triticum dicoccum, KU120), against Br48, a Triticum isolate of Pyricularia oryzae. Two other wheat accessions, St17 (T. dicoccum, KU112) and St25 (T. dicoccum, KU122), were also resistant against Br48 and showed a similar disease reaction pattern to St24. Crosses between these resistant accessions yielded no susceptible F2 seedlings, suggesting that St24, St17, and St25 carry the same resistance gene. Furthermore, a single avirulence gene corresponding to Rmg7 was detected in a segregation analysis of random F1 progenies between Br48 and MZ5-1-6, an Eleusine isolate virulent to St24 at a higher temperature. This avirulence gene was recognized not only by St24, but also by St17 and St25, thus supporting the preceding results indicating that all three accessions carry Rmg7. This resistance gene may have potential in future wheat breeding programs."

"12928780","abstracttext","A thermo-sensitive genic male-sterile (TGMS) wheat line ( Triticum aestivum L.) BNY-S was obtained from the spontaneous mutant of BNY-F. Its fertility was decided by the temperature during the differentiation stage of the spikelets. BNY-S was completely sterile when the temperature was lower than 10 degrees C during the differentiation stage of the spikelets, but fertile when the temperature was higher than 10 degrees C. Genetic analysis indicated that the sterility of BNY-S was controlled by a single recessive gene, which was named as wtms1. An F(2) population, consisting of 3,000 individuals from the cross between BNY-S and Lankao 52-24, was used for genetic analysis and statistical analysis of the TGMS and, out of them, 158 sterile and 93 fertile extremes were present for molecular tagging and mapping of the wtms1 gene. SSR (simple sequence repeat) and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) techniques combined with BSA (bulked segregant analysis) were used to screen markers linked to the target gene. As a result, wtms1 was preliminarily mapped on chromosome 2B according to SSR analysis. In AFLP analysis, 14 polymorphic AFLP loci were identified with a linkage relation to the wtms1 gene. Then linkage analysis using the F(2) population showed that three of them, E: AAG/M: CTA(163), E: AGG/M: CTC(220) and E: ACA/M: CTA(160), were linked to the wtms1 gene relatively close to a genetic distance of 6.9 cM, 6.9 cM and 13.9 cM, respectively. Finally, the wtms1 gene was mapped between the SSR marker Xgwm 374 and the AFLP marker E: AAG/M: CTA(163) with the distance of 4.8 cM and 6.9 cM, respectively. A partial linkage map was constructed according the SSR and AFLP data."

"16983534","abstracttext","Plant non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are encoded by a multigene family and support physiological functions, which remain unclear. We adapted an efficient ligation-mediated polymerase chain reaction (LM-PCR) procedure that enabled isolation of 22 novel Triticum aestivum nsLtp (TaLtp) genes encoding types 1 and 2 nsLTPs. A phylogenetic tree clustered the wheat nsLTPs into ten subfamilies comprising 1-7 members. We also studied the activity of four type 1 and two type 2 TaLtp gene promoters in transgenic rice using the 1-Glucuronidase reporter gene. The activities of the six promoters displayed both overlapping and distinct features in rice. In vegetative organs, these promoters were active in leaves and root vascular tissues while no beta-Glucuronidase (GUS) activity was detected in stems. In flowers, the GUS activity driven by the TaLtp7.2a, TaLtp9.1a, TaLtp9.2d, and TaLtp9.3e gene promoters was associated with vascular tissues in glumes and in the extremities of anther filaments whereas only the TaLtp9.4a gene promoter was active in anther epidermal cells. In developing grains, GUS activity and GUS immunolocalization data evidenced complex patterns of activity of the TaLtp7.1a, TaLtp9.2d, and TaLtp9.4a gene promoters in embryo scutellum and in the grain epicarp cell layer. In contrast, GUS activity driven by TaLtp7.2a, TaLtp9.1a, and TaLtp9.3e promoters was restricted to the vascular bundle of the embryo scutellum. This diversity of TaLtp gene promoter activity supports the hypothesis that the encoded TaLTPs possess distinct functions in planta."

"10902713","abstracttext","The genetic basis of heading time in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was investigated through the study of flowering under normal autumn sown field conditions as well as photoperiod responses under a controlled environment. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for these traits were mapped in a doubled-haploid (DH) population derived from a cross between the wheat cultivars 'Courtot' and 'Chinese Spring'. A molecular marker linkage map of this cross that was previously constructed based on 187 DH lines and 380 markers was used for QTL mapping. The genome was well covered (85%) except for chromosomes 1D and 4D, and a set of anchor loci regularly spaced over the genome (one marker each 15.5 cM) was chosen for marker regression analysis. The presence of a QTL was declared at a significance threshold of alpha = 0.005. The population was grown under field conditions in Clermont-Ferrand, France during two years (1994-1995), in Norwich, U.K. over one year (1998), and also under controlled environments in Norwich. For each trait, between 2 and 4 QTLs were identified with individual effects ranging between 6.3% and 44.4% of the total phenotypic variation. Two QTLs were detected that simultaneously affected heading time and photoperiod response. For heading time, these two QTLs were detected in more than one year. One QTL located on chromosome arm 2BS near the locus Xfbb121-2B, co-segregated with the gene Ppd-B1 known to be involved in photoperiod response. This chromosome region explained a large part of the variation (23.4-44.4% depending on the years or the traits). Another region located on chromosome arm 7BS between the loci Xfbb324-7B and Xfbb53-7B also had a strong effect (7.3-15.3%). This region may correspond to a QTL for earliness per se."

"15660971","abstracttext","The F(1) and F(2) progenies of a ten-parent diallel cross (excluding reciprocals) of hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L. em. Thell) were analyzed for combining ability for quantitative and quality traits. The results indicated significant differences among the parents for general combining ability (gca) and crosses for specific combining ability (sca) for all the characters studied. The gca and sca components of variance were significant for all the traits. However, the gca component of variance was predominant indicating the predominance of additive gene effects for the traits studied. Among the parents Durgapura 65, HD 2285, Lok-1, Raj 1972 and HD 2329 were the best general combiners for grain yield and average to high combiners for tillers per plant, grain yield per spike, grains per spike and 1000-grain weight. The best specific crosses for grain yield were Sonalika x WH 157, HD 2428 x Durgapura 65, Durgapura 65 x Sonalika, HD 2428 x Lok-1 and CPAN 3004 x Raj 1972. The parent Raj 1972, Lok-1 and HD 2285 were the best general combiners for grain yield and protein content, however, Raj 3077 was the best general combiner for protein content. The most suitable specific crosses for protein content were HD 2329 x HD 2285, HD 2428 x Raj 1972 and CPAN 3004 x WH 157. Most of the specific crosses for grain yield as well as protein content involved high x average, average x average and average x poor general combiners. To ensure further increase in grain yield along with high protein, combinations of desirable yield components is advocated. Inclusion of F(1) hybrids showing high sca and having parents with good gca, into multiple crosses and/or bi-parental mating, or diallel selective mating could prove a worthwhile approach for further improvement of grain yield in bread wheat."
"12428019","articletitle","Role of the arginyl-glycyl-aspartic motif in the action of Ptr ToxA produced by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis."
"12428019","abstracttext","A fundamental problem of plant science is to understand the biochemical basis of plant/pathogen interactions. The foliar disease tan spot of wheat (Triticum aestivum), caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, involves Ptr ToxA, a proteinaceous host-selective toxin that causes host cell death. The fungal gene ToxA encodes a 17.2-kD pre-pro-protein that is processed to produce the mature 13.2-kD toxin. Amino acids 140 to 142 of the pre-pro-protein form an arginyl-glycyl-aspartic (RGD) sequence, a motif involved in the binding of some animal proteins and pathogens to transmembrane receptor proteins called integrins. Integrin-like proteins have been identified in plants recently, but their role in plant biology is unclear. Our model for Ptr ToxA action predicts that toxin interacts with a putative host receptor through the RGD motif. Mutant clones of a ToxA cDNA, created by polymerase chain reaction such that the RGD in the pro-toxin was changed to arginyl-alanyl-aspartic or to arginyl-glycyl-glutamic, were expressed in Escherichia coli. Extracts containing mutated forms of toxin failed to cause host cell death, but extracts from E. coli expressing both a wild-type pro-protein cDNA and a control mutation away from RGD were active in cell death development. In competition experiments, 2 mM RGD tripeptide reduced the level of electrolyte leakage from wheat leaves by 63% when co-infiltrated with purified Ptr ToxA (15 microg mL(-1)) obtained from the fungus, but the control peptide arginyl-glycyl-glutamyl-serine provided no protection. These experiments indicate that the RGD motif of Ptr ToxA is involved with toxin action, possibly by interacting with a putative integrin-like receptor in the host."
"12232165","articletitle","In Vitro Analysis of Light-Induced Transcription in the Wheat psbD/C Gene Cluster Using Plastid Extracts from Dark-Grown and Short-Term-Illuminated Seedlings."
"12232165","abstracttext","We describe a plastid in vitro transcription system that reflects characteristic features of the light-regulated transcription observed in vivo. Multiple transcripts of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) psbD/C gene cluster comprise six distinct 5[prime] ends including four transcription initiation sites designated as D/C-1 through D/C-4. Transcripts from one particular site, D/C-3, were found to be conspicuously enhanced in abundance after 4 h of illumination in vivo. The plastid extract prepared from 5-d-old dark-grown wheat seedlings was capable of transcribing from the D/C-2 and D/C-4 sites in vitro but had almost no transcription activity from the light-responsive D/C-3 site (the D/C-1 site was not examined). The plastid extract from 4-h-illuminated seedlings initiated transcription from the light-responsive site (D/C-3). Transcription from the D/C-2 and D/C-4 sites was not enhanced by using the extract from 4-h-illuminated seedlings, indicative of specific activation of the light-responsive promoter on the D/C-3 site by the extract from 4-h-illuminated seedlings. The plastid extract from 4-h-illuminated seedlings was divided into two fractions on a heparin-Sepharose column, into which the light-induced component(s) responsible for activation of the D/C-3 promoter and RNA polymerase were separated. The fraction containing the component(s) activating the D/C-3 promoter induced the transcription activity from the D/C-3 site in the plastid extract from dark-grown seedlings. It is concluded that the plastid extract from 4-h-illuminated seedlings contains some light-regulatory component(s) that activate specifically the light-responsive promoter."

"11999849","abstracttext","Aegilops tauschii (Coss.) Schmal. (2n = 2x = 14, DD) (syn. A. squarrosa L.; Triticum tauschii) is well known as the D-genome donor of bread wheat (T. aestivum, 2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD). Because of conserved synteny, a high-density map of the A. tauschii genome will be useful for breeding and genetics within the tribe Triticeae which besides bread wheat also includes barley and rye. We have placed 249 new loci onto a high-density integrated cytological and genetic map of A. tauschii for a total of 732 loci making it one of the most extensive maps produced to date for the Triticeae species. Of the mapped loci, 160 are defense-related genes. The retrotransposon marker system recently developed for cultivated barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was successfully applied to A. tauschii with the placement of 80 retrotransposon loci onto the map. A total of 50 microsatellite and ISSR loci were also added. Most of the retrotransposon loci, resistance (R), and defense-response (DR) genes are organized into clusters: retrotransposon clusters in the pericentromeric regions, R and DR gene clusters in distal/telomeric regions. Markers are non-randomly distributed with low density in the pericentromeric regions and marker clusters in the distal regions. A significant correlation between the physical density of markers (number of markers mapped to the chromosome segment/physical length of the same segment in microm) and recombination rate (genetic length of a chromosome segment/physical length of the same segment in microm) was demonstrated. Discrete regions of negative or positive interference (an excess or deficiency of crossovers in adjacent intervals relative to the expected rates on the assumption of no interference) was observed in most of the chromosomes. Surprisingly, pericentromeric regions showed negative interference. Islands with negative, positive and/or no interference were present in interstitial and distal regions. Most of the positive interference was restricted to the long arms. The model of chromosome structure and function in cereals with large genomes that emerges from these studies is discussed."

"12685035","abstracttext","We studied the kinetics of induction of the wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) gene Wdhn 13, which encodes a predominantly cold-responsive protein belonging to the LEA D-11 dehydrin family. The deduced polypeptide WDHN 13 (MW = 12.8 kDa) represented the smallest dehydrin member in cereals with three lysine-rich K-segments. Purified WDHN 13 was boiling-stable due to its high hydrophilicity. Western blot analysis using the polyclonal anti-WDHN 13-antibody revealed a number of cross-reacting proteins in mature embryos and endosperms and in seedling leaves under normal temperature (25 degrees C), while a single major protein and a transcript were induced in response to low temperature (4 degrees C) in the leaves. An increase in the amount of mRNA was temporary with a peak occurring at day 3 to 5 of the low temperature treatment, while the protein accumulation proceeded with a significant time lag and continued until the end of the experiment (day 10). Steady-state levels of the transcript and protein were much higher in the leaves than in the roots of low temperature-treated seedlings and were apparently modulated by light/dark conditions. The light/dark modulation of the transcript and protein levels suggested stabilization of the mRNA under the low temperature condition. Genomic Southern blot analysis showed that Wdhn 13 is located on the homoeologous group 7 chromosomes, unlike all other wheat Dhn genes that are located on the group 6 chromosomes."

"12586883","abstracttext","Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient for plants. The ability of plants to maintain significant yields under low Zn is termed Zn efficiency (ZE) and its genetic and mechanistic basis is still not well understood. Previously, we showed that root Zn uptake did not play a role in ZE. In the current study, Zn-efficient and -inefficient wheat (Triticum aestivum) genotypes were grown for 13 d in chelate buffer nutrient solutions at low (0.1 pM), sufficient (150 pM), and high (1 microM) Zn(2+) activities and analyzed for root-to-shoot translocation of Zn, subcellular leaf Zn distribution, and activity and expression of the Zn-requiring enzymes in leaves. No correlation between ZE and Zn translocation to the shoot was found. Furthermore, total and water-soluble concentrations of leaf Zn were not associated with ZE, and no differences in subcellular Zn compartmentation were found between Zn-efficient and -inefficient genotypes. However, the expression and activity of the Zn-requiring enzymes copper (Cu)/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and carbonic anhydrase did correlate with differences in ZE. Northern analysis suggested that Cu/ZnSOD gene expression was up-regulated in the Zn-efficient genotype, Kirgiz, but not in inefficient BDME. Under Zn deficiency stress, the very Zn-efficient genotype Kirgiz and moderately Zn-efficient Dagdas exhibited an increased activity of Cu/ZnSOD and carbonic anhydrase when compared with Zn-inefficient BDME. These results suggest that Zn-efficient genotypes may be able to maintain the functioning of Zn-requiring enzymes under low Zn conditions; thus, biochemical Zn utilization may be an important component of ZE in wheat."

"15154461","abstracttext","Damage caused by Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say), was quantified in spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L., trials near Pendleton and Moro, OR, during 2001 and 2002. Five field experiments were established to examine genetic resistance to Fusarium crown rot, Fusarium pseudograminearum (O'Donnell & Aoki), and economic damage by lesion nematode, Pratylenchus neglectus (Rensch, 1924) (Filipjev Schuurmanns & Stekhoven, 1941) and Pratylenchus thornei (Sher & Allen, 1941). Hessian fly became the dominant factor affecting grain yield in four experiments. Genotypes carrying the H3-resistance gene had grain yields 66 and 68% higher than susceptible genotypes in cultivar trials during 2001 and 2002, respectively. Yield reductions were detected when Hessian fly infestation rates exceeded 50% plants during 2001 and 15% plants (8% tillers) during 2002. In two trials during 2001, in-furrow application of aldicarb (Temik) at planting improved yields of four Hessian fly-susceptible cultivars by 72 and 144% (up to 1,959 kg/ha) and yields of one Hessian fly-resistant cultivar by 2 and 3%. Resistant cultivars and aldicarb improved grain quality as much as two market grades during 2001. The value of increased grain production with Hessian fly-resistant cultivars in four field experiments ranged from dollar 112 to dollar 252/ha, excluding price incentives for improved market quality. Yield reduction due to combined damage from Hessian fly and either Fusarium crown rot or lesion nematode was additive. This report seems to be the first quantitative yield loss estimate for Hessian fly in spring wheat in the semiarid environment of the inland Pacific Northwest."

"18943223","abstracttext","We examined interactions between wheat (Triticum aestivum) and Mycosphaerella graminicola, causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch, to determine whether specific interactions occur between host and pathogen genotypes that could be involved in eroding resistance. The moderate resistance of the wheat cultivar Madsen has eroded significantly in the Willamette Valley of Oregon since its release in 1990. Foote is a replacement cultivar expressing moderate resistance and was released in 2000. Isolates of M. graminicola were collected from Foote and Madsen in 2004 and 2005 and tested on each cultivar in growth chamber and greenhouse experiments. There was a significant (P <or= 0.002) cultivar by isolate source interaction in all experiments when the isolates were tested individually and also when they were tested as bulks of isolates collected from the same cultivar. Though the resistance of Foote is still very effective in the field, isolates sampled from that cultivar at the end of the season in both 2004 and 2005 were of high virulence on Foote, while those collected from Madsen usually were of low virulence on Foote. Foote demonstrated qualitative reactions more typical of a major resistance gene that provides incomplete resistance. Madsen showed a more continuous variation in reaction to M. graminicola isolates. The mean of the isolates collected from Madsen caused significantly (P <or= 0.05) more disease on Madsen than on Foote for the individual isolates collected in 2005, but not for those collected in 2004. Bulk populations collected from Madsen did not cause significantly more disease on Madsen than did isolates collected from Foote in either 2004 or 2005."

"16906405","abstracttext","Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins involved in plant defence. A number of PGIPs have been characterized from dicot species, whereas only a few data are available from monocots. Database searches and genome-specific cloning strategies allowed the identification of four rice (Oryza sativa L.) and two wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) Pgip genes. The rice Pgip genes (Ospgip1, Ospgip2, Ospgip3 and Ospgip4) are distributed over a 30 kbp region of the short arm of chromosome 5, whereas the wheat Pgip genes, Tapgip1 and Tapgip2, are localized on the short arm of chromosome 7B and 7D, respectively. Deduced amino acid sequences show the typical LRR modular organization and a conserved distribution of the eight cysteines at the N- and C-terminal regions. Sequence comparison suggests that monocot and dicot PGIPs form two separate clusters sharing about 40% identity and shows that this value is close to the extent of variability observed within each cluster. Gene-specific RT-PCR and biochemical analyses demonstrate that both Ospgips and Tapgips are expressed in the whole plant or in a tissue-specific manner, and that OsPGIP1, lacking an entire LRR repeat, is an active inhibitor of fungal polygalacturonases. This last finding can contribute to define the molecular features of PG-PGIP interactions and highlights that the genetic events that can generate variability at the Pgip locus are not only limited to substitutions or small insertions/deletions, as so far reported, but can also involve variation in the number of LRRs."

"20559816","abstracttext","Genetic diversity and linkage disequilibrium (LD) were investigated in 376 Asian and European accessions of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). After a first and rapid screening about diversity and genetic structure at the whole genome scale using 70 simple sequence repeats (SSRs), we focused on a sequenced contig (ctg954) of 3.1 Mb located on the short arm of chromosome 3B of cv. Chinese Spring, using 32 SSRs and 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms. This contig is part of a multiple fungal resistance region. Mean polymorphism information content value on the 32 SSRs was slightly higher in the Asian genepool (0.396) than that for the European (0.329) pool. Compared with results at the whole genome scale, data from this 3.1-Mb region indicated similar trends in genetic diversity indices between both genepools. Population structure and molecular variance analyses demonstrated significant genetic differentiation and geographical subdivision in both groups of accessions. Concerning LD at the contig level, the European population had a significantly higher mean r(2) value (0.23) than the Asian population (0.18), indicating a stronger LD in the European material. With a mean of 1 marker every 74 kb, the resolution reached here allowed to perform a detailed comparative analysis of the LD and genetic diversity along the complete 3.1-Mb region in both genepools. A sliding-window approach revealed some interesting regions of the contig where LD is increasing when genetic diversity is decreasing. This study provides an in-depth understanding of molecular population genetics in European and Asian wheat gene pools, and prospects for association mapping of important sources of fungal disease resistance."

TaCHP transcript abundance was higher in Shanrong No.3 than in Jinan 177, but was reduced by the imposition of salinity or drought stress, as well as by the exogenous supply of ABA. When JN17, a salinity hypersensitive wheat cultivar, was engineered to overexpress TaCHP, its performance in the face of salinity stress was improved, and the ectopic expression of TaCHP in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) also improved the ability of salt tolerance. The expression level of a number of stress reporter genes (AtCBF3, AtDREB2A, AtABI2, and AtABI1) was raised in the transgenic lines in the presence of salinity stress, while that of AtMYB15, AtABA2, and AtAAO3 was reduced in its absence. The presence in the upstream region of the TaCHP open reading frame of the cis-elements ABRE, MYBRS, and MYCRS suggests that it is a component of the ABA-dependent and -independent signaling pathways involved in the plant response to abiotic stress. We suggest that TaCHP enhances stress tolerance via the promotion of CBF3 and DREB2A expression."

"19828671","abstracttext","Storage protein activator (SPA) is a key regulator of the transcription of wheat (Triticum aestivum) grain storage protein genes and belongs to the Opaque2 transcription factor subfamily. We analyzed the sequence polymorphism of the three homoeologous Spa genes in hexaploid wheat. The level of polymorphism in these genes was high particularly in the promoter. The deduced protein sequences of each homoeolog and haplotype show greater than 93% identity. Two major haplotypes were studied for each Spa gene. The three Spa homoeologs have similar patterns of expression during grain development, with a peak in expression around 300 degree days after anthesis. On average, Spa-B is 10 and seven times more strongly expressed than Spa-A and Spa-D, respectively. The haplotypes are associated with significant quantitative differences in Spa expression, especially for Spa-A and Spa-D. Significant differences were found in the quantity of total grain nitrogen allocated to the gliadin protein fractions for the Spa-A haplotypes, whereas the synthesis of glutenins is not modified. Genetic association analysis between Spa and dough viscoelasticity revealed that Spa polymorphisms are associated with dough tenacity, extensibility, and strength. Except for Spa-A, these associations can be explained by differences in grain hardness. No association was found between Spa markers and the average single grain dry mass or grain protein concentration. These results demonstrate that in planta Spa is involved in the regulation of grain storage protein synthesis. The associations between Spa and dough viscoelasticity and grain hardness strongly suggest that Spa has complex pleiotropic functions during grain development."

"19644666","abstracttext","Over time, many single, all-stage resistance genes to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are circumvented by race changes in the pathogen. In contrast, high-temperature, adult-plant resistance (HTAP), which only is expressed during the adult-plant stage and when air temperatures are warm, provides durable protection against stripe rust. Our objective was to identify major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for HTAP resistance to stripe rust in the spring wheat cultivar 'Louise'. The mapping population consisted of 188 recombinant inbred lines (RIL) from a Louise (resistant) by 'Penawawa' (susceptible) cross. F(5:6) lines were evaluated for stripe rust reaction under natural infection in replicated field trials at five locations in the US Pacific Northwest in 2007 and 2008. Infection type (IT) and disease severity were recorded for each RIL 2-4 times per location. In all environments, Penawawa, the susceptible parent, was rated with an IT ranging from 6 to 8 at all growth stages evaluated. In contrast, Louise, the resistant parent, was rated with an IT of 2 or 3 across growth stages. Distribution of IT values was bimodal, indicating a single major gene was affecting the trait. The parents and RIL population were evaluated with 295 polymorphic simple sequence repeat and one single nucleotide polymorphism markers. One major QTL, designated QYrlo.wpg-2BS, associated with HTAP resistance in Louise, was detected on chromosome 2BS (LOD scores ranging from 5.5 to 62.3 across locations and years) within a 16.9 cM region flanked by Xwmc474 and Xgwm148. SSR markers associated with QYrlo.wpg-2BS are currently being used in marker-based forward breeding strategies to transfer the target region into adapted germplasm to improve the durability of resistance in resulting cultivars."

(em Thell), genotypes containing the Dnx, Dn7, Dn6, and Dn4 genes for resistance to the Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), along with Dn0, a susceptible control, were assessed to determine the categories of D. noxia biotype 2 (RWA2) resistance in each genotype and RWA2 feeding behaviors on Dnx and Dn0 plants by using the electronic penetration graph technique. At 14 d postinfestation, Dn0 plants exhibited intense chlorosis and leaf rolling, and all test genotypes expressed some degree of chlorosis and leaf rolling, except Dn7, which was not damaged. Both Dn7 and Dnx expressed antibiosis effects, significantly reducing the numbers of aphids on plants and the intrinsic rate of aphid increase. Dn6 plants seemed to contain tolerance, exhibiting tolerance index measurements for leaf and root dry weight and plant height that were significantly lower than those of the susceptible Dn0 plants. Principal component analyses indicated that antibiosis and leaf rolling data explained 80% of the variance among genotypes. Electronic penetration graph analysis demonstrated contrasting results between RWA1 and RWA2 phloem sieve element phase feeding events, but results indicated that Dnx resistance factors are present in the sieve element cells or phloem sap. Plants containing Dnx exhibit antibiosis resistance to D. noxia RWA2 similar to that in plants containing the Secale cereale L. (rye)-based Dn7 gene without the negative baking quality traits associated with Dn7."
"21999670","articletitle","Domain loss has independently occurred multiple times in plant terpene synthase evolution."
"21999670","abstracttext","The extensive family of plant terpene synthases (TPSs) generally has a bi-domain structure, yet phylogenetic analyses consistently indicate that these synthases have evolved from larger diterpene synthases. In particular, that duplication of the diterpene synthase genes required for gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis provided an early predecessor, whose loss of a approximately 220 amino acid 'internal sequence element' (now recognized as the γ domain) gave rise to the precursor of the modern mono- and sesqui-TPSs found in all higher plants. Intriguingly, TPSs are conserved by taxonomic relationships rather than function. This relationship demonstrates that such functional radiation has occurred both repeatedly and relatively recently, yet phylogenetic analyses assume that the 'internal/γ' domain loss represents a single evolutionary event. Here we provide evidence that such a loss was not a singular event, but rather has occurred multiple times. Specifically, we provide an example of a bi-domain diterpene synthase from Salvia miltiorrhiza, along with a sesquiterpene synthase from Triticum aestivum (wheat) that is not only closely related to diterpene synthases, but retains the ent-kaurene synthase activity relevant to the ancestral gibberellin metabolic function. Indeed, while the wheat sesquiterpene synthase clearly no longer contains the 'internal/γ' domain, it is closely related to rice diterpene synthase genes that retain the ancestral tri-domain structure. Thus, these findings provide examples of key evolutionary intermediates that underlie the bi-domain structure observed in the expansive plant TPS gene family, as well as indicating that 'internal/γ' domain loss has occurred independently multiple times, highlighting the complex evolutionary history of this important enzymatic family."

Four independent offspring pairs, each consisting of a GM line and its corresponding non-GM control line, were grown under different soil nutrient conditions and with and without fungicide treatment in the glasshouse. Furthermore, we performed a field experiment with a similar design to validate our glasshouse results. The transgene increased the resistance to powdery mildew in all environments. However, GM plants reacted sensitive to fungicide spraying in the glasshouse. Without fungicide treatment, in the glasshouse GM lines had increased vegetative biomass and seed number and a twofold yield compared with control lines. In the field these results were reversed. Fertilization generally increased GM/control differences in the glasshouse but not in the field. Two of four GM lines showed up to 56% yield reduction and a 40-fold increase of infection with ergot disease Claviceps purpurea compared with their control lines in the field experiment; one GM line was very similar to its control."

"21725861","abstracttext","The canonical Gα subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex from wheat (Triticum aestivum), GA3, and the calcium-binding protein, Clo3, were revealed to interact both in vivo and in vitro and Clo3 was shown to enhance the GTPase activity of GA3. Clo3 is a member of the caleosin gene family in wheat with a single EF-hand domain and is induced during cold acclimation. Bimolecular Fluorescent Complementation (BiFC) was used to localize the interaction between Clo3 and GA3 to the plasma membrane (PM). Even though heterotrimeric G-protein signaling and Ca²⁺ signaling have both been shown to play a role in the response to environmental stresses in plants, little is known about the interaction between calcium-binding proteins and Gα. The GAP activity of Clo3 towards GA3 suggests it may play a role in the inactivation of GA3 as part of the stress response in plants. GA3 was also shown to interact with the phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, PI-PLC1, not only in the PM but also in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Surprisingly, Clo3 was also shown to interact with PI-PLC1 in the PM and ER. In vitro analysis of the protein-protein interaction showed that the interaction of Clo3 with GA3 and PI-PLC1 is enhanced by high Ca²⁺ levels. Three-way affinity characterizations with GA3, Clo3 and PI-PLC1 showed the interaction with Clo3 to be competitive, which suggests that Clo3 may play a role in the Ca²⁺-triggered feedback regulation of both GA3 and PI-PLC1. This hypothesis was further supported by the demonstration that Clo3 has GAP activity with GA3."

"21763408","abstracttext","Abiotic stress seriously affects crop growth and productivity. To better understand the mechanisms plant uses to cope with drought, cold and salt stress, it is necessary to isolate and characterize important regulators response to these stresses. In this study, we cloned a MYB gene from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and designated it as TaMYB3R1 based on its conserved three repeats in MYB domain. The sequence of TaMYB3R1 protein shares high identity to other plant MYB3R proteins. Subcellular localization experiment in onion epidermal cells proved that TaMYB3R1 localized in the nucleus. Trans-activation essays in yeast cells confirmed that TaMYB3R1 was a transcriptional activator, and only C-terminal region was able to activate the expression of β-galactosidase. DNA-binding test showed the MSA cis element-binding activity of TaMYB3R1. After exogenous application of phytohormone ABA, the expression of TaMYB3R1 was induced, and its transcripts accumulated up to 24h; this is also the case for MeJA treatment, but after it peaked at 4h, it decreased to low levels. However, either SA or ET had no obvious effect on the expression of TaMYB3R1. Furthermore, the TaMYB3R1 was initially expressed at low levels and was gradually induced following treatment with salt, and continued to increase up to 72 h. This was similar for the cold treatment. In contrast, the peak appeared at 6h of the PEG treatment, and then gradually decreased to low levels. Our results suggest that TaMYB3R1 is potentially involved in wheat response to drought, salt and cold stress."

"23259709","abstracttext","Hydroponic plant growth studies indicate that silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) are phytotoxic. In this work, the phytotoxicity of commercial Ag NPs (10 nm) was evaluated in a sand growth matrix. Both NPs and soluble Ag were recovered from water extracts of the sand after growth of plants challenged with the commercial product; the surface charge of the Ag NPs in this extract was slightly reduced compared to the stock NPs. The Ag NPs reduced the length of shoots and roots of wheat in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, 2.5 mg/kg of the NPs increased branching in the roots of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), thereby affecting plant biomass. Micron-sized (bulk) Ag particles (2.5 mg/kg) as well as Ag ions (63 μg Ag/kg) equivalent to the amount of soluble Ag in planted sand with Ag NPs (2.5 mg/kg) did not affect plant growth compared to control. In contrast, higher levels of Ag ions (2.5 mg/kg) reduced plant growth to a similar extent as the Ag NPs. Accumulation of Ag was detected in the shoots, indicating an uptake and transport of the metal from the Ag NPs in the sand. Transmision electron microscopy indicated that Ag NPs were present in shoots of plants with roots exposed to the Ag NPs or high levels of Ag ions. Both of these treatments caused oxidative stress in roots, as indicated by accumulation of oxidized glutathione, and induced expression of a gene encoding a metallothionein involved in detoxification by metal ion sequestration. Our findings demonstrate the potential effects of environmental contamination by Ag NPs on the metabolism and growth of food crops in a solid matrix."

"23979894","abstracttext","Thioredoxin h (Trxh) is a ubiquitous protein that reduces disulfides in target proteins, and is itself reduced by NADPH-thioredoxin reductase. In the current study, the complementary DNA sequence and the genomic sequence of the three-pistil (TP) line of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were obtained from spikes through reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and touchdown-PCR. Sequence alignment of amino acids of TPTrxh then allowed for predictions of its physicochemical properties, secondary structures, tertiary structures, and functional domains. Furthermore, the TPTrxh gene was overexpressed in Escherichia coli and its activity was demonstrated using a dithiothreitol-dependent insulin assay. The expression patterns of TPTrxh were analyzed through real-time RT-PCR in different tissues and across different developmental stages of young spikes. The complementary DNA of TPTrxh was found to be 411 bp in length, encoding 118 amino acids. Its genomic sequence was determined to be 2632 bp, possessing 3 exons and 2 introns. Functional domain analysis indicated that TPTrxh contained a WCGPC motif located at the end of the second β-fold and on the initial side of the second α-helix. The TPTrxh protein reduces intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bridges in target proteins. Young spikes contain higher levels of TPTrxh transcripts than do stems and leaves. The transcript levels in the young spikes (2-5 mm in length) of the Chinese Spring TP line increased 2.84-fold relative to those of young spikes (2-5 mm in length) of the Chinese Spring line. These data provide a basis for future research into the function of Trxh, and offer further insight into the molecular mechanism of the TP mutation in wheat."
"24318680","articletitle","Effects of polyploidy on photosynthesis."
"24318680","abstracttext","In polyploid plants the photosynthetic rate per cell is correlated with the amount of DNA per cell. The photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area is the product of the rate per cell times the number of photosynthetic cells per unit area. Therefore, the photosynthetic rate per unit leaf area will increase if there is a less than proportional increase in cell volume at higher ploidal levels, or if cell packing is altered to allow more cells per unit leaf area. In autopolyploids (Medicago sativa, C3 species, and Pennisetum americanum, C4 species) there is a doubling of photosynthesis per cell and of cell volume in the tetraploid compared to the diploid. However, there is a proportional decrease in number of cells per unit leaf area with this increase in ploidy such that the rate of photosynthesis per leaf area does not change. There is more diversity in the relationship between ploidal level (gene dosage) and photosynthetic rates per unit leaf area in allopolyploids. This is likely to reflect the effects of natural selection on leaf anatomy, and novel genetic interactions from contributed genomes which can occur with allopolyploidy. In allopolyploid wheat (C3 species) a higher cell volume per unit DNA at the higher ploidal level is negatively correlated with photosynthesis rate per unit leaf area. Although photosynthesis per cell increases with ploidy, photosynthesis per leaf area decreases, being lowest in the allohexaploid, cultivated bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Alternatively, doubling of photosynthetic rate per cell with doubling of DNA, with apparent natural selection for decreased cell volume per unit DNA, results in higher rates of photosynthesis per leaf area in octaploid compared to tetraploid Panicum virgatum (C4) which may be a case of allopolyploidy. Similar responses probably occur in Festuca arundinacea. Therefore, in some systems anatomical factors affecting photosynthesis are also affected by ploidal level. It is important to evaluate that component as well as determining the effect on biochemical processes. Current information on polyploidy and photosynthesis in several species is discussed with respect to anatomy, biochemistry and bases for expressing photosynthetic rates."

Genes are designated as Sr55, Pm46 and Ltn3 , respectively. Wheat (Triticum aestivum) accession RL6077, known to carry the pleiotropic slow rusting leaf and yellow rust resistance genes Lr67/Yr46 in Thatcher background, displayed significantly lower stem rust (P. graminis tritici; Pgt) and powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis tritici; Bgt) severities in Kenya and in Norway, respectively, compared to its recurrent parent Thatcher. We investigated the resistance of RL6077 to stem rust and powdery mildew using Avocet × RL6077 F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from two photoperiod-insensitive F3 families segregating for Lr67/Yr46. Greenhouse seedling tests were conducted with Mexican Pgt race RTR. Field evaluations were conducted under artificially initiated stem rust epidemics with Pgt races RTR and TTKST (Ug99 + Sr24) at Ciudad Obregon (Mexico) and Njoro (Kenya) during 2010-2011; and under natural powdery mildew epiphytotic in Norway at Ås and Hamar during 2011 and 2012. In Mexico, a mean reduction of 41 % on stem rust severity was obtained for RILs carrying Lr67/Yr46, compared to RILs that lacked the gene, whereas in Kenya the difference was smaller (16 %) but significant. In Norway, leaf tip necrosis was associated with Lr67/Yr46 and RILs carrying Lr67/Yr46 showed a 20 % reduction in mean powdery mildew severity at both sites across the 2 years of evaluation. Our study demonstrates that Lr67/Yr46 confers partial resistance to stem rust and powdery mildew and is associated with leaf tip necrosis. The corresponding pleiotropic, or tightly linked, genes, designated as Sr55, Pm46, and Ltn3, can be utilized to provide broad-spectrum durable disease resistance in wheat."

"24193881","abstracttext","Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy (2n=14, V genome) is a wild, allogamous, diploid grass species that is a potential genetic resource for wheat improvement. The diversity of high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin subunits of the seed storage proteins of this species was examined in populations sampled in their natural habitats in Italy and Yugoslavia where the species is widely distributed. The results of selfed progeny tests confirmed that the allelic variation of HMW-glutenin subunits in D. villosum is controlled by a single locus (Glu-V1). Fourteen alleles at Glu-V1 were found among 982 individuals representing 12 populations from Italy and two from Yugoslavia, with a mean of seven alleles per population. Among the 14 Glu-V1 alleles, one produced no HMW-glutenin subunits, ten coded for a single subunit, and three for two subunits. The mobilities of all the subunits in SDS-PAGE gels were greater than that of reference subunit 7 of Triticum aestivum cv Chinese Spring. Eight of the alleles were relatively abundant (mean frequency over all populations ranged from 0.08 to 0.17) and distributed widely among the 14 populations (8 to 14); five of the alleles were rare (0.003 to 0.021) and found in only 1 to 5 populations. The frequencies of two alleles could not be individually estimated because of the similar electrophoretic mobility of their subunits. The multiple-allelic diversity at Glu-V1 was high (He ranged from 0.700 to 0.857) but similar from population to population. Overall, about 7% of the total allelic variation was distributed among populations (Gst=0.072), and more than 90% within populations. Whether the allelic variation at Glu-V1 is subject to natural selection is unknown, but the discovery of the homozygous null Glu-V1 alleles in the present study may be useful in pursuing this question. The multiple-allelic diversity in Glu-V1 presents the plant breeder with an opportunity to evaluate and select the most useful alleles for transfer to wheat. The importance of an evaluation genetic diversity in a wild species before interspecific gene transfers are attempted is well illustrated in this study."

"27019468","abstracttext","Plants must respond to environmental cues and schedule their development in order to react to periods of abiotic stress and commit fully to growth and reproduction under favorable conditions. This study was initiated to identify SNP markers for characters expressed from the seedling stage to plant maturity in spring and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) genotypes adapted to western Canada. Three doubled haploid populations with the winter cultivar 'Norstar' as a common parent were developed and genotyped with a 90K Illumina iSelect SNP assay and a 2,998.9 cM consensus map with 17,541 markers constructed. High heritability's reflected large differences among the parents and relatively low genotype by environment interactions for all characters considered. Significant QTL were detected for the 15 traits examined. However, different QTL for days to heading in controlled environments and the field provided a strong reminder that growth and development are being orchestrated by environmental cues and caution should be exercised when extrapolating conclusions from different experiments. A QTL on chromosome 6A for minimum final leaf number, which determines the rate of phenological development in the seedling stage, was closely linked to QTL for low-temperature tolerance, grain quality, and agronomic characters expressed up to the time of maturity. This suggests phenological development plays a critical role in programming subsequent outcomes for many traits. Transgressive segregation was observed for the lines in each population and QTL with additive effects were identified suggesting that genes for desirable traits could be stacked using Marker Assisted Selection. QTL were identified for characters that could be transferred between the largely isolated western Canadian spring and winter wheat gene pools demonstrating the opportunities offered by Marker Assisted Selection to act as bridges in the identification and transfer of useful genes among related genetic islands while minimizing the drag created by less desirable genes."

"26948880","abstracttext","Seed dormancy has fundamental importance in plant survival and crop production; however, the mechanisms regulating dormancy remain unclear [1-3]. Seed dormancy levels generally decrease during domestication to ensure that crops successfully germinate in the field. However, reduction of seed dormancy can cause devastating losses in cereals like wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) due to pre-harvest sprouting, the germination of mature seed (grain) on the mother plant when rain occurs before harvest. Understanding the mechanisms of dormancy can facilitate breeding of crop varieties with the appropriate levels of seed dormancy [4-8]. Barley is a model crop [9, 10] and has two major seed dormancy quantitative trait loci (QTLs), SD1 and SD2, on chromosome 5H [11-19]. We detected a QTL designated Qsd2-AK at SD2 as the single major determinant explaining the difference in seed dormancy between the dormant cultivar ""Azumamugi"" (Az) and the non-dormant cultivar ""Kanto Nakate Gold"" (KNG). Using map-based cloning, we identified the causal gene for Qsd2-AK as Mitogen-activated Protein Kinase Kinase 3 (MKK3). The dormant Az allele of MKK3 is recessive; the N260T substitution in this allele decreases MKK3 kinase activity and appears to be causal for Qsd2-AK. The N260T substitution occurred in the immediate ancestor allele of the dormant allele, and the established dormant allele became prevalent in barley cultivars grown in East Asia, where the rainy season and harvest season often overlap. Our findings show fine-tuning of seed dormancy during domestication and provide key information for improving pre-harvest sprouting tolerance in barley and wheat."
"27288224","articletitle","The Metabolite Pathway between Bundle Sheath and Mesophyll: Quantification of Plasmodesmata in Leaves of C3 and C4 Monocots."
"27288224","abstracttext","C4 photosynthesis is characterized by a CO2-concentrating mechanism between mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS) cells of leaves. This generates high metabolic fluxes between these cells, through interconnecting plasmodesmata (PD). Quantification of these symplastic fluxes for modeling studies requires accurate quantification of PD, which has proven difficult using transmission electron microscopy. Our new quantitative technique combines scanning electron microscopy and 3D immunolocalization in intact leaf tissues to compare PD density on cell interfaces in leaves of C3 (rice [Oryza sativa] and wheat [Triticum aestivum]) and C4 (maize [Zea mays] and Setaria viridis) monocot species. Scanning electron microscopy quantification of PD density revealed that C4 species had approximately twice the number of PD per pitfield area compared with their C3 counterparts. 3D immunolocalization of callose at pitfields using confocal microscopy showed that pitfield area per M-BS interface area was 5 times greater in C4 species. Thus, the two C4 species had up to nine times more PD per M-BS interface area (S. viridis, 9.3 PD µm(-2); maize, 7.5 PD µm(-2); rice 1.0 PD µm(-2); wheat, 2.6 PD µm(-2)). Using these anatomical data and measured photosynthetic rates in these C4 species, we have now calculated symplastic C4 acid flux per PD across the M-BS interface. These quantitative data are essential for modeling studies and gene discovery strategies needed to introduce aspects of C4 photosynthesis to C3 crops."

"28472326","abstracttext","Molecular and cytological mechanisms concerning the effects of nitrogen on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) storage protein biosynthesis and protein body development remain largely elusive. We used transcriptome sequencing, proteomics techniques, and light microscopy to investigate these issues. In total, 2585 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 57 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were found 7 days after anthesis (DAA), and 2456 DEGs and 64 DEPs were detected 18 DAA after nitrogen treatment. Gene ontology terms related to protein biosynthesis processes enriched these numbers by 678 and 582 DEGs at 7 and 18 DAA, respectively. Further, 25 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways were involved in protein biosynthesis at both 7 and 18 DAA. DEPs related to storage protein biosynthesis contained gliadin and glutenin subunits, most of which were up-regulated after nitrogen treatment. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that some gliadin and glutenin subunit encoding genes were differentially expressed at 18 DAA. Structural observation revealed that wheat endosperm accumulated more and larger protein bodies after nitrogen treatment. Collectively, our findings suggest that nitrogen treatment enhances storage protein content, endosperm protein body quantity, and partial processing quality by altering the expression levels of certain genes involved in protein biosynthesis pathways and storage protein expression at the proteomics level."

"27842961","abstracttext","Biochar has been frequently suggested as an amendment to improve soil quality and mitigate climate change. To investigate the optimal management of nitrogen (N) fertilization, we examined the combined effect of biochar and N fertilizer on plant N uptake and N 2 O emissions in a cereal rotation system in a randomized two-factorial field experiment on a sandy loam soil in Brandenburg, Germany. The biochar treatment received 10Mgha -1 wood-derived biochar in September 2012. Four levels of N fertilizer, corresponding to 0, 50%, 100%, 130% of the recommended fertilizer level, were applied in winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)) and winter rye (Secale cereal L.) in 2013 and 2014 followed by the catch crop oil radish (Raphanus sativus L. var. oleiformis). Biomass and N uptake of winter wheat and winter rye were significantly affected by the level of N fertilizer but not by biochar. For N uptake of oil radish an interaction effect was observed for biochar and N fertilizer. Without applied fertilizer, 39% higher N uptake was found in the presence of biochar, accompanied by higher soil NH 4 + content and elevated cumulative CO 2 emissions. At 130% of the recommended fertilizer level, 16% lower N uptake and lower cumulative N 2 O emissions were found in the biochar-mediated treatment. No significant change in abundance of microbial groups and nosZ gene were observed. Our results highlight that biochar can have a greenhouse gas mitigation effect at high levels of N supply and may stimulate nutrient uptake when no N is supplied."

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that the quantity of SGBPs was reduced significantly by water-deficit treatment. Phosphoproteome characterization of SGBPs under water-deficit treatment demonstrated a reduced level of phosphorylation of main starch synthesis enzymes, particularly for granule-bound starch synthase (GBSS I), starch synthase II-a (SS II-a), and starch synthase III (SS III). Specifically, the Ser34 site of the GBSSI protein, the Tyr358 site of SS II-a, and the Ser837 site of SS III-a exhibited significant less phosphorylation under water-deficit treatment than well-watered treatment. Furthermore, the expression levels of several key genes related with starch biosynthesis detected by qRT-PCR were decreased significantly at 15 days post-anthesis under water-deficit treatment. Immunolocalization showed a clear movement of GBSS I from the periphery to the interior of starch granules during grain development, under both water-deficit and well-watered conditions."

"32117103","articletitle","Chronic Sublethal Aluminum Exposure and Avena fatua Caryopsis Colonization Influence Gene Expression of Fusarium avenaceum F.a.1."
"32117103","abstracttext","Fusarium avenaceum F.a.1 is a novel strain of a fungal plant pathogen capable of preferentially decaying wild oat ( Avena fatua ) caryopses compared with those of wheat ( Triticum aestivum ). Understanding the molecular mechanisms governing weed seed-pathogen interactions is crucial to developing novel weed seed suppression technologies. Additionally, wild oat often competes with wheat in regions undergoing soil acidification, which leads to increases in soluble concentrations of many metals, including aluminum (Al). There is a dearth of information regarding the gene expression responses of Fusarium species to Al toxicity, or how metal toxicity might influence caryopsis colonization. To address this, a transcriptomic approach was used to investigate molecular responses of F.a.1 during wild oat caryopsis colonization in the presence and absence of chronic, sublethal concentrations of Al (400 μM). Caryopsis colonization was associated with induction of genes related to virulence, development, iron metabolism, oxidoreduction, stress, and detoxification, along with repression of genes associated with development, transport, cell-wall turnover, and virulence. Caryopsis colonization during Al exposure resulted in the induction of genes associated with virulence, detoxification, stress, iron metabolism, oxidoreduction, and cell wall turnover, along with repression of genes associated with cell wall metabolism, virulence, development, detoxification, stress, and transcriptional regulation. Aluminum exposure in the absence of caryopses was associated with induction of genes involved in siderophore biosynthesis, secretion, uptake, and utilization, along with several other iron metabolism-related and organic acid metabolism-related genes. The siderophore-related responses associated with Al toxicity occurred concurrently with differential regulation of genes indicating disruption of iron homeostasis. These findings suggest Al toxicity is attenuated by siderophore metabolism in F.a.1. In summary, both caryopsis colonization and Al toxicity uniquely influence transcriptomic responses of F.a.1."

"30077133","abstracttext","Role of plant nsLTP in biotic stress is well reported; however, their role during abiotic stress is far from clear. This study comprises genome-wide identification of LTPs and characterizes the regulation and function of two Triticum aestivum lipid transfer proteins, TaLTP40 and TaLTP75, under stresses that influence membrane fluidity. A total of 105 LTP gene family members have been identified. The selected LTPs for functional validation were highly expressed during salt, cold and drought stress. Further, selected LTPs showed differential expression thermotolerant and thermosusceptible wheat cultivars. Higher expression of many TaLTPs was observed under different abiotic stresses in thermotolerant wheat cultivars as compared to thermosusceptible cultivars. TaLTPs regulation was correlated with light energy distribution studies under similar stress conditions. Cellular localization revealed localization of different TaLTPs to the tonoplast membrane along with the organelles involved in the secretory pathway. Induction of TaLTPs was observed upon treatment with dimethylsulphoxide. TaLTP40 and TaLTP75 overexpressing transgenic Arabidopsis showed a constitutively enhanced salt tolerance. Both the TaLTP40 and TaLTP75 overexpressing lines performed better in terms of chlorophyll a fluorescence, total chlorophyll content, membrane injury index, total biomass, percentage germination, percentage survival and relative growth rate. Hence, our analyses indicate that TaLTPs expression might be driven by change in membrane fluidity and could be involved in transferring membrane lipids to the biological membranes thus imparting tolerance to various abiotic stresses."

"30795252","abstracttext","Host plant resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum) has been the principal means of managing leaf rust caused by Puccinia triticina. The need for durable resistance has changed the focus from the use of seedling resistance to adult-plant resistance. The objectives of this study were to determine the genetic basis for adult-plant resistance and to determine the most effective method to identify adult-plant resistance genes Lr12, 13, and 34 among 116 contemporary soft red winter wheat cultivars and breeding lines. Adult-plant resistance was detected by inoculating flag leaves with a race that was virulent on seedlings. Approximately 90% of the lines expressed resistance under controlled conditions. It was postulated that the adult-plant resistance in 67 lines was due in part to either Lr12, 13, or 34; the adult-plant resistance detected in 17 lines was attributed to Lr12 based on a distinctive low infection type very similar to that on the isoline TcLr12; the adult-plant resistance in 27 lines was attributed to Lr34, as all of these lines expressed a ""leaf tip necrosis"" in the field (a phenotype controlled by a gene known to be tightly linked with Lr34); and the adult-plant resistance in 23 lines was attributed to Lr13 based on a high infection type at 18.1°C and low infection type at 25.5°C with one or more pathogen isolates that were virulent on Lr13 at 18.1°C and avirulent on Lr13 at 25.5°C. The adult-plant resistance detected in the remaining 40% of the lines was due to one or more unidentified genes for adult-plant resistance. In a 4-year field study at several locations, nearly 29% of the lines were resistant at all locations, no line was susceptible at all locations, and only 30% of the lines were susceptible at one or more locations. Given that many of the lines in this study were resistant to all known races of P. triticina before being released as cultivars, the high frequency of adult-plant resistance in this study demonstrates that adult-plant resistance can be incorporated even in the presence of highly effective seedling resistance."

"30364249","abstracttext","High-density genetic linkage maps are essential for precise mapping quantitative trait loci (QTL) in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). In this study, a high-density genetic linkage map consisted of 6312 SNP and SSR markers was developed to identify QTL controlling kernel size and weight, based on a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from the cross of Shixin828 and Kenong2007. Seventy-eight putative QTL for kernel length (KL), kernel width (KW), kernel diameter ratio (KDR), and thousand kernel weight (TKW) were detected over eight environments by inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM). Of these, six stable QTL were identified in more than four environments, including two for KL ( qKL-2D and qKL-6B.2 ), one for KW ( qKW-2D.1 ), one for KDR ( qKDR-2D.1 ) and two for TKW ( qTKW-5A and qTKW-5B.2 ). Unconditional and multivariable conditional QTL mapping for TKW with respect to TKW component (TKWC) revealed that kernel dimensions played an important role in regulating the kernel weight. Seven QTL-rich genetic regions including seventeen QTL were found on chromosomes 1A (2), 2D, 3A, 4B and 5B (2) exhibiting pleiotropic effects. In particular, clusters on chromosomes 2D and 5B possessing significant QTL for kernel-related traits were highlighted. Markers tightly linked to these QTL or clusters will eventually facilitate further studies for fine mapping, candidate gene discovery and marker-assisted selection (MAS) in wheat breeding."

"30367612","abstracttext_background","Heat stress is a severe environmental stress that affects plant growth and reduces yield. Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) is a cytoprotective protein that is involved in the response to biotic and abiotic stresses. The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) BI-1 mutants atbi1-1 and atbi1-2 are hypersensitive to heat stress, and AtBI-1 overexpression rescues thermotolerance deficiency in atbi1 plants. Nevertheless, the mechanism of BI-1 in plant thermotolerance is still unclear."
"30367612","abstracttext_results","We identified a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) BI-1 gene, TaBI-1.1, which was highly upregulated in an RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of heat-treated wheat. The upregulation of TaBI-1.1 under heat stress was further demonstrated by real time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) and β-glucuronidase (GUS) staining. Compared with the wild type Col-0, the atbi1-2 mutant is hypersensitive to heat stress, and constitutive expression of TaBI-1.1 in atbi1-2 (35S::TaBI-1.1/ atbi1-2) rescued the deficiency of atbi1-2 under heat stress. Furthermore, we identified TaFKBP62 as a TaBI-1.1-interacting protein that co-localized with TaBI-1.1 on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and enhanced heat stress tolerance.

"31410494","articletitle","Mapping quantitative trait loci associated with common bunt resistance in a spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) variety Lillian."
"31410494","abstracttext_key message","Based on their consistency over environments, two QTL identified in Lillian on chromosomes 5A and 7A could be useful targets for marker assisted breeding of common bunt resistance. Common bunt of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) caused by Tilletia tritici and T. laevis is an economically important disease because of losses in grain yield and reduced grain quality. Resistance can be quantitative, under the control of multiple small effect genes. The Canada Western Red Spring wheat variety Lillian is moderately resistant to common bunt races found on the Canadian prairies. This study was conducted to identify and map quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance against common bunt in Lillian. A doubled haploid population comprising 280 lines was developed from F 1 plants of the cross of Lillian by Vesper. The lines were inoculated at seeding with the two races L16 (T. laevis) and T19 (T. tritici), grown in field near Swift Current, SK, in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and assessed for disease incidence. The lines were genotyped with the 90 K iSelect SNP genotyping assay, and a high-density genetic map was constructed. Quantitative trait locus analysis was performed with MapQTL.6 ® software. Two relatively stable common bunt resistance QTL, detected in two of the 3 years, were identified on chromosomes 5A and 7A from Lillian. In addition, three less stable QTL, appearing in one out of 3 years, were identified: one was contributed by Lillian on chromosome 3D and two were contributed by Vesper on chromosomes 1D and 2A. Epistatic interaction was identified for the bunt incidence between 3D and 7A resulting in greater bunt resistance. Future bunt resistance breeding will benefit from combining these QTL through gene pyramiding."
"32692663","articletitle","A phenylpropanoid diglyceride associates with the leaf rust resistance Lr34res gene in wheat."
"32692663","abstracttext","The gene Lr34res is one of the most long-lasting sources of quantitative fungal resistance in wheat. It is shown to be effective against leaf, stem, and stripe rusts, as well as powdery mildew and spot blotch. Recent biochemical characterizations of the encoded ABC transporter have outlined a number of allocrites, including phospholipids and abscisic acid, consistent with the established general promiscuity of ABC transporters, but ultimately leaving its mechanism of rust resistance unclear. Working with flag leaves of Triticum aestivum L. variety 'Thatcher' (Tc) and a near-isogenic line of 'Thatcher' into which the Lr34res allele was introgressed (Tc+Lr34res; RL6058), a comparative semi-targeted metabolomics analysis of flavonoid-rich extracts revealed virtually identical profiles with the exception of one metabolite accumulating in Tc+Lr34res, which was not present at comparable levels in Tc. Structural characterization of the purified metabolite revealed a phenylpropanoid diglyceride structure, 1-O-p-coumaroyl-3-O-feruloylglycerol (CFG). Additional profiling of CFG across a collection of near-isogenic lines and representative Lr34 haplotypes highlighted a broad association between the presence of Lr34res and elevated accumulations of CFG. Depletion of CFG upon infection, juxtaposed to its relatively lower anti-fungal activity, suggests CFG may serve as a storage form of the more potent anti-microbial hydroxycinnamic acids that are accessed during defense responses. Altogether these findings suggest a role for the encoded LR34res ABC transporter in modifying the accumulation of CFG, leading to increased accumulation of anti-fungal metabolites, essentially priming the wheat plant for defense."

"32992277","abstracttext","Crop plants require an optimum range of temperature for normal growth and development however high temperature can adversely affect the plants, induce oxidative stress and disintegrate biomolecules especially DNA and proteins. In wheat, high temperature stress (35-40 °C) during ripening stage hampers the yield tremendously. In this study, we assessed high temperature (HT) induced oxidative stress, subsequent DNA damage and role of priming in stress tolerance by analyzing DNA repair enzyme Triticum aestivum AP endonuclease (TaApe1L). Sixteen days old seedlings of wheat varieties PBW 550 and PBW 343 were primed with mild drought and exposed to HT (38 °C) for 2, 4, and 6 h. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) was used as oxidative stress marker and quantified on regular time intervals. DNA damage was analyzed by DNA laddering and TaApe1L gene expression was analyzed using RT PCR and western blotting. Phylogenetic analysis of Ape1 revealed presence of some key amino acids that are evolutionary conserved. A significant increase in H 2 O 2 content was observed after 6 h of exposure especially in PBW 343. Similarly, the DNA damage was also increased with HT exposure especially in PBW 343. The TaApe1L mRNA expression increased after priming in both the varieties after 4 h. But APE1 protein expression was higher in PBW 343, which can be correlated with DNA damage and repair. Lastly, it can be concluded that there is varietal difference in the HT sensitivity but 6 h exposure was detrimental to both the varieties. Also, drought priming improved HT tolerance by over expressing APE1."

"33166353","abstracttext","Drought and heat stress constrain wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields globally. To identify putative mechanisms and candidate genes associated with combined drought and heat stress tolerance, we developed bread wheat near-isogenic lines (NILs) targeting a quantitative trait locus (QTL) on chromosome 6B which was previously associated with combined drought and heat stress tolerance in a diverse panel of wheats. Genotyping-by-sequencing was used to identify additional regions that segregated in allelic pairs between the recurrent and the introduced exotic parent, genome-wide. NILs were phenotyped in a gravimetric platform with precision irrigation and exposed to either drought or to combined drought and heat stress from three days after anthesis. An increase in grain weight in NILs carrying the exotic allele at 6B locus was associated with thicker, greener leaves, higher photosynthetic capacity and increased water use index after re-watering. RNA sequencing of developing grains at early and later stages of treatment revealed 75 genes that were differentially expressed between NILs across both treatments and timepoints. Differentially expressed genes coincided with the targeted QTL on chromosome 6B and regions of genetic segregation on chromosomes 1B and 7A. Pathway enrichment analysis showed the involvement of these genes in cell and gene regulation, metabolism of amino acids and transport of carbohydrates. The majority of these genes have not been characterized previously under drought or heat stress and they might serve as candidate genes for improved abiotic stress tolerance."

"28633642","abstracttext_background","The resistance to leaf rust (Lr) caused by Puccinia triticina in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) has been well studied over the past decades with over 70 Lr genes being mapped on different chromosomes and numerous QTLs (quantitative trait loci) being detected or mapped using DNA markers. Such resistance is often divided into race-specific and race-nonspecific resistance. The race-nonspecific resistance can be further divided into resistance to most or all races of the same pathogen and resistance to multiple pathogens. At the molecular level, these three types of resistance may cover across the whole spectrum of pathogen specificities that are controlled by genes encoding different protein families in wheat. The objective of this study is to predict and analyze genes in three such families: NBS-LRR (nucleotide-binding sites and leucine-rich repeats or NLR), START (Steroidogenic Acute Regulatory protein [STaR] related lipid-transfer) and ABC (ATP-Binding Cassette) transporter. The focus of the analysis is on the patterns of relationships between these protein-coding genes within the gene families and QTLs detected for leaf rust resistance."
"28633642","abstracttext_results","We predicted 526 ABC, 1117 NLR and 144 START genes in the hexaploid wheat genome through a domain analysis of wheat proteome. Of the 1809 SNPs from leaf rust resistance QTLs in seedling and adult stages of wheat, 126 SNPs were found within coding regions of these genes or their neighborhood (5 Kb upstream from transcription start site [TSS] or downstream from transcription termination site [TTS] of the genes). Forty-three of these SNPs for adult resistance and 18 SNPs for seedling resistance reside within coding or neighboring regions of the ABC genes whereas 14 SNPs for adult resistance and 29 SNPs for seedling resistance reside within coding or neighboring regions of the NLR gene. Moreover, we found 17 nonsynonymous SNPs for adult resistance and five SNPs for seedling resistance in the ABC genes, and five nonsynonymous SNPs for adult resistance and six SNPs for seedling resistance in the NLR genes. Most of these coding SNPs were predicted to alter encoded amino acids and such information may serve as a starting point towards more thorough molecular and functional characterization of the designated Lr genes. Using the primer sequences of 99 known non-SNP markers from leaf rust resistance QTLs, we found candidate genes closely linked to these markers, including Lr34 with distances to its two gene-specific markers being 1212 bases (to cssfr1) and 2189 bases (to cssfr2)."
"28633642","abstracttext_conclusion","This study represents a comprehensive analysis of ABC, NLR and START genes in the hexaploid wheat genome and their physical relationships with QTLs for leaf rust resistance at seedling and adult stages. Our analysis suggests that the ABC (and START) genes are more likely to be co-located with QTLs for race-nonspecific, adult resistance whereas the NLR genes are more likely to be co-located with QTLs for race-specific resistance that would be often expressed at the seedling stage. Though our analysis was hampered by inaccurate or unknown physical positions of numerous QTLs due to the incomplete assembly of the complex hexaploid wheat genome that is currently available, the observed associations between (i) QTLs for race-specific resistance and NLR genes and (ii) QTLs for nonspecific resistance and ABC genes will help discover SNP variants for leaf rust resistance at seedling and adult stages. The genes containing nonsynonymous SNPs are promising candidates that can be investigated in future studies as potential new sources of leaf rust resistance in wheat breeding."

"30320534","abstracttext","Wheat blast, caused by the Magnaporthe oryzae Triticum pathotype, is an economically important fungal disease of wheat. Wheat blast symptoms are similar to Fusarium head scab and can cause confusion in the field. Currently, no in-field diagnostic exists for M. oryzae Triticum. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) primers were designed to target the PoT2 and MoT3 loci, previously shown to be specific for M. oryzae and M. oryzae Triticum, respectively. Specificity was determined using 158 M. oryzae strains collected from infected wheat and other grasses and representing geographic and temporal variation. Negative controls included 50 Fusarium spp. isolates. Sensitivity was assessed using 10-fold serial dilutions of M. oryzae Triticum gDNA. PoT2- and MoT3-based assays showed high specificity for M. oryzae and M. oryzae Triticum, respectively, and sensitivity to approximately 5 pg of DNA per reaction. PoT2 and MoT3 assays were tested on M. oryzae Triticum-infected wheat seed and spikes and identified M. oryzae and M. oryzae Triticum, respectively, using a field DNA extraction kit and the portable Genie II system. The mitochondrial NADH-dehydrogenase (nad5) gene, an internal control for plant DNA, was multiplexed with PoT2 and MoT3 and showed results comparable with individual assays. These results show applicability for M. oryzae Triticum field surveillance, as well as identifying nonwheat species that may serve as a reservoir or source of inoculum for nearby wheat fields."

"24430021","abstracttext","This report deals with a method of analysis which uses existing hexaploid wheat monosomics to establish gene-chromosome associations in a tetraploid variety. Monosomics of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring belonging to the 14 lines of A and B genomes were crossed as female parents with Triticum durum cv. Capeiti, a spring type at present widely grown in Italy. For each line, two F 1 populations were obtained, normal pentaploids (2 n = 35) and monopentaploid (2 n = 34), in which, in turn, the monosomic A or B chromosome present was supplied by the tetraploid wheat. The morphological and physiological differences observed in the monopentaploid lines are attributed to differential expression of the genetic information concerning the character investigated, carried by the chromosome present in hemizygous condition. Then, only recessive or partially dominant alleles of the variety to be tested can be identified and attributed to a specific chromosome in the F 1 generation.Eight parameters were analyzed: culm and spike length, length and width of 1st (flag) and 2nd uppermost leaves, days from germination to heading and awn development.As far as culm length is concerned, although heterotic effect is present, seven chromosomes seem to be responsible for the modification of this character (1A, 2A, 2B, 3B, 4B, 5B, and 6 A); chromosomes 2A and 2B in particular, carry major factor (s) for plant height. A similar picture is presented by spike length which seems to be controlled by factors located in several chromosomes belonging to homoeologous groups 1, 2, 3 and 5, as well as the chromosome 4B.Leaf length, also, shows a complex pattern of inheritance. Monosomic conditions for chromosomes 1A and 1B increased, while monosomy for 5A and 5B significantly decreased, leaf length. A highly significant correlation was found between the mean lengths of the 1st and 2 nd leaves (= 0.74). Some monosomic lines (4A, 4B, 5A; 5B; 6A; 7A and 7B) had leaves significantly narrower than in the control and only monosomic 2A had broader leaves. The period from germination to heading seems to be influenced by at least 6 chromosomes. Three monosomic lines are significantly earlier (mono 1A, 7A and 5B) and three (mono 5A, 2B and 7B) are significantly later than the hybrid control.Finally, 8 monosomic lines were found to interfere significantly with awn development. Three lines (mono 2A, 2B and 7A) show a decrease and 5 (mono 1B; 3A, 3B; 4B and 6B) show an increase in awn development. On the basis of evidence in the literature and our own results, it appears that this analysis fits previous results perfectly and actually adds to the picture two further awn-promoting factors, A9 and A10, located on the 7A and 1B chromosomes respectively."

The T. aestivum mt genome carries two atp6 gene copies, whereas only a single copy of the atp6 gene is present in T. timopheevi mtDNA. Sequence data suggest that identical sequences upstream of the atp6 gene and the orf25 gene are involved in homologous recombination in both cytoplasms. The differences in the upstream sequences of the atp6 or the orf25 genes affect transcript sizes in both cytoplasms. Transcription initiation may occur at conserved promoter elements located at variable distances upstream of the aminoacid coding sequences. The correlation between the gene rearrangements and the CMS phenomenon in T. timopheevi is discussed."
"20084169","articletitle","Heterologous expression of wheat VERNALIZATION 2 (TaVRN2) gene in Arabidopsis delays flowering and enhances freezing tolerance."
"20084169","abstracttext","The vernalization gene 2 (VRN2), is a major flowering repressor in temperate cereals that is regulated by low temperature and photoperiod. Here we show that the gene from Triticum aestivum (TaVRN2) is also regulated by salt, heat shock, dehydration, wounding and abscissic acid. Promoter analysis indicates that TaVRN2 regulatory region possesses all the specific responsive elements to these stresses. This suggests pleiotropic effects of TaVRN2 in wheat development and adaptability to the environment. To test if TaVRN2 can act as a flowering repressor in species different from the temperate cereals, the gene was ectopically expressed in the model plant Arabidopsis. Transgenic plants showed no alteration in morphology, but their flowering time was significantly delayed compared to controls plants, indicating that TaVRN2, although having no ortholog in Brassicaceae, can act as a flowering repressor in these species. To identify the possible mechanism by which TaVRN2 gene delays flowering in Arabidopsis, the expression level of several genes involved in flowering time regulation was determined. The analysis indicates that the late flowering of the 35S::TaVRN2 plants was associated with a complex pattern of expression of the major flowering control genes, FCA, FLC, FT, FVE and SOC1. This suggests that heterologous expression of TaVRN2 in Arabidopsis can delay flowering by modulating several floral inductive pathways. Furthermore, transgenic plants showed higher freezing tolerance, likely due to the accumulation of CBF2, CBF3 and the COR genes. Overall, our data suggests that TaVRN2 gene could modulate a common regulator of the two interacting pathways that regulate flowering time and the induction of cold tolerance. The results also demonstrate that TaVRN2 could be used to manipulate flowering time and improve cold tolerance in other species."

"32689450","articletitle","Environmental effects on stunting and the expression of a tiller inhibition (tin) gene in wheat."
"32689450","abstracttext","A recessive gene (tin) that inhibits tillering in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and that may be important in the redirection of assimilate from unproductive to productive tillers, has been reported. However, this gene has also been associated with a fatal condition known as 'stunting'. The severity of this phenomenon has been shown to increase when plants are grown under long photoperiods and at low temperatures. The objectives of this study were to observe how the expression of the tin gene varied in different genetic backgrounds, in addition to obtaining a better understanding of environmental factors that may affect both tillering and stunting in lines with the tin gene. Plants were grown outdoors in Canberra, Australia, at various times throughout the year, as well as under controlled conditions where photoperiod, temperature and light intensity were varied. The inhibition of tillers resulting from the presence of the tin gene was most extreme in summer, autumn and spring (up to 90% reduction in tillering). However, when sown in late autumn and winter, tillering was reduced by between 30-50% for the tin lines compared with their near-isogenic parents. Reduced tillering in the tin lines was due to an earlier cessation of tillering rather than a reduced rate. Stunting was frequently observed in some lines more than others when plants were grown under long days and when temperatures were low. The daily minimum temperature, rather than the average daily temperature, was associated with stunting. The duration of the dark period also influenced stunting, with a longer dark period reducing the incidence of stunting from almost 100% to 0%. In all experiments where irradiance was increased, stunting also increased. In addition, elevated CO2 also increased growth characteristics associated with stunting. It is concluded that stunting is associated with a high assimilate supply to the main stem shoot apex before the time of floral initiation. This is caused by an inhibition of tillering and a high photothermal quotient. Leaf length was found to be a good indicator of stunting severity, with stunted plants producing shorter leaves than those plants which failed to stunt. Measurements of leaf length indicated that stunting is induced when the second leaf is expanding."

"11779639","abstracttext","The rRNA gene promoter regions of three diploid wheats Triticum boeoticum Boiss, Triticum urartu Tum. ex Gandil, and Triticum monococcum L. have been sequenced and analyzed. It has been found that the rRNA promoter initiation regions of diploid wheats contain the sequences, which differ from the evolutionary conserved TATAGTAGG (+1 is underlined) motif of monocots. The transient expression assay in wheat protoplasts confirmed that cloned sequences are active promoters. Deletion analysis showed that the promoter sequence localized between -113 and +15 (relative to +1) is enough to direct RNA polymerase I-dependent transcription."
"10791808","articletitle","Development of a PCR marker for rapid identification of the Bt-10 gene for common bunt resistance in wheat."
"10791808","abstracttext","In western Canada, the Bt-10 resistance gene in wheat (Triticum aestivum) is effective against all the known races of common bunt caused by Tilletia tritici and T laevis. The genotypes of 199 F2 plants, originated from a cross between BW553 containing Bt-10 and the susceptible spring wheat cultivar 'Neepawa,' were established in greenhouse and field inoculation studies. A ratio of 1:2:1 resistant : heterozygous : susceptible was observed for bunt reaction, indicating that Bt-10 was expressed in a partially dominant fashion. A polymorphic DNA fragment, amplified using RAPD, and previously shown to be linked to Bt-10 was sequenced and SCAR (sequence characterized amplified region) primers devised. However, SCAR primers failed to amplify the polymorphic fragment. Restriction of PCR products with DraI revealed a polymorphic fragment of 490 bp resulting from a single base pair difference between lines possessing Bt-10 and those lacking the gene. As per the base pair difference, FSD and RSA primers were designed to generate a 275-bp polymorphic DNA fragment. Both 275- and 490-bp polymorphic fragments were present in all of the 22 cultivars known to carry Bt-10, and absent in all 16 cultivars lacking Bt-10. A 3:1 ratio was observed for presence: absence of the 275-bp marker in the F2 population. Using Southern analysis, the 490-bp fragment was effective in differentiating homozygous resistant plants from those heterozygous for Bt-10, based on its presence and the hybridization signal strength. A 1:2:1 resistant : heterozygous : susceptible ratio was also observed for the molecular marker and corresponded to 88% of the phenotypes deduced from the original F2 population. The molecular marker was estimated to be between 1.1 cM and 6.5 cM away from the Bt-10 resistance gene, based on the segregation analysis. Segregation analyses of Bt-10 and the 275-bp marker, evaluated in three different Canada Prairie Spring (CPS) wheat populations, demonstrated a segregation ratio of 3:1 for the molecular marker in two of the populations. These results demonstrated that the PCR marker system using the FSD and RSA primer pair permitted a rapid and reliable identification of individual lines carrying the Bt-10 gene for resistance to common bunt."
"16941095","articletitle","Characterization of three low-molecular-weight Glu-D3 subunit genes in common wheat."
"16941095","abstracttext","Low-molecular-weight glutenins (LMW-GS) in common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) are of great importance for processing quality of pan bread and noodles. The objectives of this study are to identify LMW-GS coding genes at GluD3 locus on chromosome 1D and to establish relationships between these genes and GluD3 alleles (a, b, c, d, and e) defined by protein electrophoretic mobility. Specific primer sets were designed to amplify each of the three LMW-GS chromosome 1D gene regions including upstream, coding and downstream regions of eight wheat cultivars containing GluD3 a, b, c, d and e alleles. Three LMW-GS genes, designated as GluD3-1, GluD3-2 and GluD3-3, were amplified from the eight wheat cultivars. The allelic variants of these three genes were analysed at the DNA and protein level. GluD3-1 showed two allelic variants or haplotypes, one common to cultivars containing protein alleles a, d and e (designated GluD3-11) and the other was present in cultivars with alleles b and c (designated GluD3-12). Comparing with GluD3-12, a 3-bp deletion was found in the coding region of the N-terminal repetitive domain of GluD3-11, leading to a glutamine deletion at the 116th position. GluD3-2 had three variants at the DNA level in the eight cultivars, which were designated as GluD3-21, GluD3-22 and GluD3-23. In comparison to GluD3-21, a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was detected for GluD3-22 in the signal peptide region, resulting in an amino acid change from alanine to threonine at the 11th position; and 11 mutations were found at GluD3-23, with five in upstream region, four in coding region and two in downstream region, respectively. GluD3-3 had two haplotypes, designated as GluD3-31 and GluD3-32, both belonging to LMW-s glutenin subunits though their first amino acids in N-terminal region are different. Compared with the GenBank GluD3 genes, nucleotide sequences of GluD3-21 and GluD3-23 were the same as X13306 and AB062875, respectively. GluD3-22 and GluD3-11 had only one-base difference from U86027 and AB062865. GluD3-12 was not found in the GenBank database, indicating a newly identified GluD3 gene variation. GluD3-3 was a new gene different from any other known GluD3 genes. Analyses of the relationship between Glu-D3 alleles defined by protein electrophoretic mobility and different GluD3 gene variations at the DNA or protein level provided molecular basis for DNA based identification of glutenin alleles."
"30812939","articletitle","First Report of Tan Spot of Wheat Caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis in the Pacific Northwest."
"30812939","abstracttext","In late May 2001, lesions resembling tan spot were observed on lower leaves of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in early boot stage in Nez Perce County, ID. Abundant sporulation was observed from tan lesions with chlorotic haloes after 2 days incubation in a moist chamber at room temperature. Conidia were multicelled, straw colored, approximately 100 × 15 µm, rounded at the apex, and borne singly on dark brown conidiophores. The fungus fit the morphological description of Drechslera tritici-repentis (Died.) Shoemaker, the anamorphic state of Pyrenophora tritici-repentis (Died.) Drechs. (2). Three single-conidial isolates were sampled from infected plants in a 5 × 1 m area of the affected field and induced to sporulate. Two of the isolates were used to spray-inoculate 3-week-old susceptible wheat (cv. Madsen) in the greenhouse (one plant per isolate, 1 × 10 5 conidia/ml), and tan spot lesions were apparent 3 to 5 days after inoculation with both isolates. DNA was extracted from all three isolates, and the entire nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) was amplified with ITS1 and ITS4 primers (4). Similarly, 610 bp of the 5' end of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase gene (gpd) was amplified with gpd-1 and gpd-2 primers (1). ITS and gpd amplicons were direct-sequenced on both strands, and alignment revealed that all three isolates were identical for both regions. A BLAST search of the NCBI database with the ITS sequence revealed P. tritici-repentis accessions AY004808 and AF071348 and D. tritici-repentis accession AF163060 as the closest matches with 100, 99.8, and 98.8% sequence similarity, respectively. A similar search with the gpd sequence revealed P. tritici-repentis accessions AY004838 and AF081370 and P. bromi accession AY004839 as the closest matches with 100, 100, and 99.0% sequence similarity, respectively. These results, coupled with the morphological identification and inoculation results, confirm the identity of the fungus as P. tritici-repentis. Although reported on other grass hosts in the region (3), to our knowledge, this is the first report of tan spot of wheat in the Pacific Northwest. This disease has been of little concern to wheat producers in the Pacific Northwest due to low rainfall and relative humidity during the growing season. References: (1) M. L. Berbee et al.

"16094424","abstracttext","Two dominant powdery mildew resistance genes introduced from Triticum carthlicum accession PS5 to common wheat were identified and tagged using microsatellite markers. The gene designated PmPS5A was placed on wheat chromosome 2AL and linked to the microsatellite marker Xgwm356 at a genetic distance of 10.2 cM. Based on the information of its origin, chromosome location, and reactions to 5 powdery mildew isolates, this gene could be a member of the complex Pm4 locus. The 2nd gene designated PmPS5B was located on wheat chromosome 2BL with 3 microsatellite markers mapping proximally to the gene: Xwmc317 at 1.1 cM; Xgwm111 at 2.2 cM; and Xgwm382 at 4.0 cM; and 1 marker, Xgwm526, mapping distally to the gene at a distance of 18.1 cM. Since this gene showed no linkage to the other 2 known powdery mildew resistance genes on wheat chromosome 2B, Pm6 and Pm26, we believe it is a novel powdery mildew resistance gene and propose to designate this gene as Pm33."

"12970484","abstracttext","Oxalate oxidase (OXO) converts oxalic acid (OA) and O(2) to CO(2) and hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), and acts as a source of H(2)O(2) in certain plant-pathogen interactions. To determine if the H(2)O(2) produced by OXO can function as a messenger for activation of defense genes and if OXO can confer resistance against an OA-producing pathogen, we analyzed transgenic sunflower (Helianthus annuus cv SMF3) plants constitutively expressing a wheat (Triticum aestivum) OXO gene. The transgenic leaf tissues could degrade exogenous OA and generate H(2)O(2). Hypersensitive response-like lesion mimicry was observed in the transgenic leaves expressing a high level of OXO, and lesion development was closely associated with elevated levels of H(2)O(2), salicylic acid, and defense gene expression. Activation of defense genes was also observed in the transgenic leaves that had a low level of OXO expression and had no visible lesions, indicating that defense gene activation may not be dependent on hypersensitive response-like cell death. To further understand the pathways that were associated with defense activation, we used GeneCalling, an RNA-profiling technology, to analyze the alteration of gene expression in the transgenic plants. Among the differentially expressed genes, full-length cDNAs encoding homologs of a PR5, a sunflower carbohydrate oxidase, and a defensin were isolated. RNA-blot analysis confirmed that expression of these three genes was significantly induced in the OXO transgenic sunflower leaves. Furthermore, treatment of untransformed sunflower leaves with jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, or H(2)O(2) increased the steady-state levels of these mRNAs. Notably, the transgenic sunflower plants exhibited enhanced resistance against the OA-generating fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum."
"16603668","articletitle","Promoter shuffling at a nuclear gene for mitochondrial RPL27. Involvement of interchromosome and subsequent intrachromosome recombinations."
"16603668","abstracttext","The Reclinomonas americana mitochondrial genome contains a mitochondrial ribosomal protein L27 (rpl27) gene, whereas the rpl27 gene is absent from all plant mitochondrial genomes examined to date. This suggests that plant mitochondrial rpl27 genes have been transferred previously from the mitochondrial genome to the nuclear genome. A nuclear cDNA encoding mitochondrial RPL27 was identified in rice (Oryza sativa). Three similar sequences were identified: rpl27-1 and rpl27-2 on chromosome 8 and rpl27-3 on chromosome 4. Harr plot analysis suggests that they were generated by inter- and intrachromosomal duplications. Interestingly, the transcribed rpl27 gene (rpl27-1) acquired a promoter sequence that was derived from the rice spt16 (Osspt16) gene, the homolog of a global transcription factor in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) located downstream from the rpl27-3 sequence on chromosome 4, after inter- and intrachromosomal recombination. Reverse transcription-PCR and promoter assay revealed that the rpl27 mRNAs were mainly transcribed from rpl27-1. A repeat of seven nucleotides (AATAGTT) was identified at the junction of rpl27-1 and rpl27-2 on chromosome 8, and the same repeat was also identified at the 5' end of rpl27-2 and the 3' end of rpl27-1. This repeat (AATAGTT) contains the hot-spot sequence AGTT, which is preferentially recognized by topoisomerase I in wheat (Triticum aestivum) germ, suggesting the involvement of topoisomerase I in this recombination. We here report the example of promoter shuffling and show that this promoter shuffling resulted from a recent segmental duplication through inter- and intrachromosomal recombination events."
"17389586","articletitle","Dicot and monocot plants differ in retinoblastoma-related protein subfamilies."
"17389586","abstracttext","The present study supports the view that the retinoblastoma functions are shared by two distinct retinoblastoma-related (RBR) protein subfamilies in the monocot cereal species, whereas dicot plants have only a single RBR protein. Genes encoding RBR proteins were identified and characterized in alfalfa (Medicago sativa), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum). The alfalfa MsRBR gene encodes a new member of the dicot RBR proteins (subfamily A). A comparison was made of two rice genes, OsRBR1 (subfamily B) and OsRBR2 (subfamily C), which exhibit differences in exon-intron organization and share only 52% amino acid sequence identity. The plant RBR proteins can be categorized into three distinct subfamilies, in which the similarity between members is greater than the similarity to other RBR proteins from the same species. Comparison of the transcript levels in various tissues revealed that the expression of the OsRBR1 gene was high in embryos or cultured cells and gradually decreased from the basal region to the tip of the leaves. The OsRBR2 gene displayed more transcripts in differentiated tissues, such as leaves and roots. In contrast, the mRNA level of the MsRBR gene did not differ significantly in either mature leaves or cultured cells. The results of yeast two-hybrid pairwise interaction assays demonstrated differences between the rice RBR variants in the interactions with the phosphatase 2A B'' regulatory subunit and an unknown protein. The in silico and functional data presented in this work highlight considerable differences between dicot and monocot species in the retinoblastoma regulatory pathways and permit an improved classification of RBR proteins in higher plants."
"19692534","articletitle","Gene content and virtual gene order of barley chromosome 1H."
"19692534","abstracttext","Chromosome 1H (approximately 622 Mb) of barley (Hordeum vulgare) was isolated by flow sorting and shotgun sequenced by GSFLX pyrosequencing to 1.3-fold coverage. Fluorescence in situ hybridization and stringent sequence comparison against genetically mapped barley genes revealed 95% purity of the sorted chromosome 1H fraction. Sequence comparison against the reference genomes of rice (Oryza sativa) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and against wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley expressed sequence tag datasets led to the estimation of 4,600 to 5,800 genes on chromosome 1H, and 38,000 to 48,000 genes in the whole barley genome. Conserved gene content between chromosome 1H and known syntenic regions of rice chromosomes 5 and 10, and of sorghum chromosomes 1 and 9 was detected on a per gene resolution. Informed by the syntenic relationships between the two reference genomes, genic barley sequence reads were integrated and ordered to deduce a virtual gene map of barley chromosome 1H. We demonstrate that synteny-based analysis of low-pass shotgun sequenced flow-sorted Triticeae chromosomes can deliver linearly ordered high-resolution gene inventories of individual chromosomes, which complement extensive Triticeae expressed sequence tag datasets. Thus, integration of genomic, transcriptomic, and synteny-derived information represents a major step toward developing reference sequences of chromosomes and complete genomes of the most important plant tribe for mankind."
"23382550","articletitle","'Overgrowth' mutants in barley and wheat: new alleles and phenotypes of the 'Green Revolution' DELLA gene."
"23382550","abstracttext","A suppressor screen using dwarf mutants of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) led to the isolation of 'overgrowth' derivatives, which retained the original dwarfing gene but grew at a faster rate because of a new mutation. The new mutations were in the Slender1 (Sln1) gene (11/13 cases), which encodes the DELLA protein central to gibberellin (GA) signalling, showed 100% genetic linkage to Sln1 (1/13), or were in the Spindly1 (Spy1) gene (1/13), which encodes another protein involved in GA signalling. The overgrowth mutants were characterized by increased GA signalling, although the extent still depended on the background GA biosynthesis capacity, GA receptor function, and DELLA activity. A comparison between two GA responses, α-amylase production and leaf growth rate, revealed degrees of specificity for both the overgrowth allele and the GA response under consideration. Many overgrowth mutants were also isolated in a dwarf line of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and 19 new alleles were identified in the Rht-B1 gene, one of the 'Green Revolution' semi-dwarfing genes and the orthologue of Sln1. The sites of amino acid substitutions in the DELLA proteins of both species provide insight into DELLA function, and included examples where identical but independent substitutions were observed. In both species, the starting lines were too dwarfed to be directly useful in breeding programmes, but new overgrowth derivatives with semidwarf heights have now been characterized. The variation they exhibit in GA-influenced traits identifies novel alleles with perfect markers that are of potential use in breeding."

"31962068","abstracttext","MYB transcription factors comprise one of the largest families in plant kingdom, which play a variety of functions in plant developmental processes and defence responses, the R2R3-MYB members are the predominant form found in higher plants. In the present study, a total of 111 StR2R3-MYB transcription factors were identified and further phylogenetically classified into 31 subfamilies, as supported by highly conserved gene structures and motifs. Collinearity analysis showed that the segmental duplication events played a crucial role in the expansion of StR2R3-MYB gene family. Synteny analysis indicated that 37 and 13 StR2R3-MYB genes were orthologous to Arabidopsis and wheat (Triticum aestivum), respectively, and these gene pairs have evolved under strong purifying selection. RNA-seq data from different tissues and abiotic stresses revealed tissue-preferential and abiotic stress-responsive StR2R3-MYB genes. We further analyzed StR2R3-MYB genes might be involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis and drought stress by using RNA-seq data of pigmented tetraploid potato cultivars and drought-sensitive and -tolerant tetraploid potato cultivars under drought stress, respectively. Moreover, EAR motifs were found in 21 StR2R3-MYB proteins and 446 pairs of proteins were predicted to interact with 21 EAR motif-containing StR2R3-MYB proteins by constructing the interaction network with medium confidence (0.4). Additionally, Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the 21 EAR motif-containing StR2R3-MYB proteins was performed to further investigate their functions. This work will facilitate future biologically functional studies of potato StR2R3-MYB transcription factors and enrich the knowledge of MYB superfamily genes in plant species."
"31209125","articletitle","Wheat TaSPL8 Modulates Leaf Angle Through Auxin and Brassinosteroid Signaling."
"31209125","abstracttext","In grass crops, leaf angle is determined by development of the lamina joint, the tissue connecting the leaf blade and sheath, and is closely related to crop architecture and yield. In this study, we identified a mutant generated by fast neutron radiation that exhibited an erect leaf phenotype caused by defects in lamina joint development. Map-based cloning revealed that the gene TaSPL8 , encoding a SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING-LIKE (SPL) protein, is deleted in this mutant. TaSPL8 knock-out mutants exhibit erect leaves due to loss of the lamina joint, compact architecture, and increased spike number especially in high planting density, suggesting similarity with its LIGULESS1 homologs in maize ( Zea mays ) and rice ( Oryza sativa ). Hence, LG1 could be a robust target for plant architecture improvement in grass species. Common wheat ( Triticum aestivum , 2 n = 6× = 42; BBAADD) is an allohexaploid containing A, B, and D subgenomes and the homeologous gene of TaSPL8 from the D subgenome contributes to the length of the lamina joint to a greater extent than that from the A and B subgenomes. Comparison of the transcriptome between the Taspl8 mutant and the wild type revealed that TaSPL8 is involved in the activation of genes related to auxin and brassinosteroid pathways and cell elongation. TaSPL8 binds to the promoters of the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR gene and of the brassinosteroid biogenesis gene CYP90D2 and activates their expression. These results indicate that TaSPL8 might regulate lamina joint development through auxin signaling and the brassinosteroid biosynthesis pathway."

The dense-spike accessions were discovered in diploid wheat (T. sinskajae) and Ae. squarrosa. Inheritance of the dense spike was studied. The trait was found to be controlled by a recessive gene in T. sinskajae and by an incomplete dominant gene in Ae. squarrosa. The dosage effect of dominant gene C was detected in interspecific pentaploid F1 hybrid plants T. compactum x T. palmovae (2n =35, A(u)A(b)BDD genome). The spike of pentaploid hybrid was not so dense as compared to hexaploid wheat T. compactum. This is the first report showing similarity of the expression of dominant gene C on D genome of the hexaploid wheat to that of dense spike gene in Ae. squarrosa. The existence of dense-spike accessions of Ae. squarrosa allows us to hypothesize that the origin of T. compactum is independent from that of common wheat."

"17507783","abstracttext","The einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum) mutant, maintained vegetative phase (mvp), was induced by nitrogen ion-beam treatment and was identified by its inability to transit from the vegetative to reproductive phase. In our previous study, we showed that WAP1 (wheat APETALA1) is a key gene in the regulatory pathway that controls phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth in common wheat. WAP1 is an ortholog of the VRN1 gene that is responsible for vernalization insensitivity in einkorn wheat. The mvp mutation resulted from deletion of the VRN1 coding and promoter regions, demonstrating that WAP1/VRN1 is an indispensable gene for phase transition in wheat. Expression analysis of flowering-related genes in mvp plants indicated that wheat GIGANTIA (GI), CONSTANS (CO) and SUPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) genes either act upstream of or in a different pathway to WAP1/VRN1."
"30754589","articletitle","Appearance of Powdery Mildew of Wheat Caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici on Pm17-Bearing Cultivars in North Carolina."
"30754589","abstracttext","Pm17 is a gene for resistance to powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis (DC.) E.O. Speer f. sp. tritici. The gene was first confirmed in the wheat-rye translocation cultivar Amigo (1). In Amigo, the translocation is T1AL-1RS and the 1RS arm has the gene Pm17. In the mid-Atlantic United States, at least two widely deployed soft red winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, McCormick (2) and Tribute (3), possess Pm17 inherited from Amigo. Before 2009, low frequencies of mostly intermediate virulence to Pm17 were detected among isolates from research plots of highly susceptible cultivars (4), but Pm17-bearing cultivars remained immune to mildew in the field. In April 2009, moderately severe powdery mildew was observed for the first time throughout plots of McCormick, Tribute, and other cultivars in both Kinston and Raleigh, NC. At Kinston, Pm17 virulence was observed at two research sites, separated by approximately 10 km, throughout plots of Amigo, McCormick, Tribute, and the hard red winter wheat cultivar TAM 303, which also contains Pm17. In the same month, virulence to Pm17 was observed in Raleigh throughout rows and plots of Amigo and TAM 303. In Kinston and Raleigh, ratings of powdery mildew severity on the Pm17-containing cultivars were 4 or 5 on a scale of 0 to 9, with 0 being the absence of mildew pustules and 9 the most severe mildew infection. Mildew was observed on leaves of all ages. Mildewed leaves were collected from field plots of all four Pm17-bearing cultivars, and an assay to confirm Pm17 virulence was conducted in the laboratory. Mixed-isolate cultures were derived from the leaves and a detached-leaf assay was performed using Amigo, which is the standard Pm17 differential (4). All tested cultures were fully to moderately virulent on Pm17 and all were fully virulent on the susceptible control Chancellor. In the field, chasmothecia (sexual fruiting bodies) were observed on Pm17-bearing cultivars. Together with the quantitatively varying Pm17 virulence detected in the laboratory assay, this suggests that multiple strains of Pm17-virulent B. graminis f. sp. tritici may be present in the field, although that has not yet been demonstrated. Pm17 has protected wheat from powdery mildew over a substantial area in the mid-Atlantic United States. The loss of Pm17 is the most important virulence shift in the U.S. wheat powdery mildew population since Pm4a became ineffective around 2002. Isolates virulent to Pm17 can be expected to appear and multiply in wheat-producing states of the mid-Atlantic United States, including Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Thus, the urgency of developing and releasing wheat cultivars with other sources of effective mildew resistance is heightened. References: (1) B. Friebe et al. Euphytica 91:59, 1996. (2) C. A.

Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries can be useful for such work. Here we report on an efficient approach for rapid isolation and sequencing of the low molecular weight glutenin subunit gene family from the 'Glenlea' wheat BAC library via primer-template mismatch PCR using universal primers, primer walking using hemi-nested touchdown (TD) PCR, and followed by direct sequencing of PCR products."
"17480230","abstracttext_results","For the primer-template mismatch PCR, the universal primers were designed based on conserved gene coding regions of consensus sequences. The effects of the universal primer-template mismatches on the efficiency of standard PCR amplification were investigated after assembly of sequences from different primers amplifying the same BAC clones. Single or multiple mismatches were observed at 5' terminal, internal and the penultimate position, respectively. These mismatches included the transition mispairs G:T, T:G, A:C and the transversion mispairs A:A, A:G, G:G, G:A. Two or more primer-template mismatches reduced PCR product yield approximately from 2-fold to 10-fold compared to PCR product yield without the primer-template mismatch. For the hemi-nested TD PCR, primers were designed based on the known sequences obtained and/or published. The hemi-nested TD PCR increased both specificity and yield by high and low annealing temperatures in two consecutive amplifications. Comparison of two methods for purifying PCR products prior to sequencing showed that purification using MultiScreen384-PCR filter plates had an advantage over ethanol purification because greater numbers of sequencing reactions could be performed from comparable volumes of PCR reactions."
"17480230","abstracttext_conclusion","This approach was fast, easy and cost-effective for isolation and sequencing of genes from complex gene families. It may be suitable for (i) isolation of other complex gene families and/or gene homologues from BAC libraries, (ii) for characterization of multi-copy repetitive elements pending availability of BAC libraries, and (iii) for filling in gaps in shotgun BAC sequencing."

"30791320","abstracttext","Lr19, a resistance gene originally transferred from Agropyron elongatum to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), has remained effective worldwide against leaf rust (Puccinia triticina Eriks.) except in Mexico (1). This report records a new pathotype of P. triticina virulent on Lr19 from India. From 2003 to 2004, 622 wheat leaf rust samples from 14 states were subjected to pathotype analysis. Samples were established on susceptible wheat cv. Agra Local, and pathotypes were identified on three sets of differentials following binomial nomenclature (3). Virulence on Lr19 (Agatha T4 line) was observed in approximately 2% of samples. These samples were picked from Lr19 (NIL), cvs. Ajit, Lal Bahadur, Local Red, Lok1, and Nirbhay from Karnataka and Gujarat states. All Lr19 virulent isolates were identical. The reference culture is being maintained on susceptible wheat cv. Agra Local and has also been put under long-term storage in a national repository at Flowerdale. From 2004 to 2005, this pathotype was detected in 6.3% of samples from central and peninsular India. There is no wheat variety with Lr19 under cultivation in India, however, it is being used in wheat breeding programs targeted at building resistance against leaf and stem rusts. NIL's Lr19/Sr25 (LC25) and Lr19/Sr25 (82.2711) were also susceptible to this isolate, whereas Lr19/Sr25 (spring accession) was resistant. The new isolate, designated as 253R31 (77-8), appears to be close to the pathotype 109R31 (4) with additional virulence for Lr19. The avirulence/virulence formula of pathotype 253R31 is Lr9, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27+31, 28, 29, 32, 36, 39, 41, 42, 43, 45/Lr1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14a, 14b, 14ab, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22a, 22b, 30, 33, 34, 35, 37, 38, 40, 44, 48, and 49. To our knowledge, this is the first report of virulence on Lr19 from two states of India. On international rust differentials, it is designated as TGTTQ (2), and is different from CBJ/QQ (1), the other isolate reported virulent on Lr19 from Mexico. The Mexican isolate is avirulent on Lr1, 2a, 2b, 2c, 3ka, 16, 21, and 30 to which the Indian isolate is virulent. However, both isolates are avirulent on Lr9, 24, 26, 36, and Lr42. Among the wheat cultivars identified during the last 6 years, HD2824, HD2833, HD2864, HI1500, HS375, HUW 510, HW 2044, HW 5001, Lok 45, MACS 6145, MP4010, NW 2036, PBW 443, PBW 498, PBW 502, PBW 524, Raj 4037, UP 2565, VL 804, VL 829, and VL 832 and lines of wheat possessing Lr9, Lr23, Lr24, and Lr26 showed resistance to this pathotype. PBW 343, which occupies more than 5 million ha in India, is also resistant to this pathotype along with PBW 373. An integrated strategy using a combination of diverse resistance genes, deployment of cultivars by using pathotype distribution data, slow rusting, and adult plant resistance is in place to curtail selection of new pathotypes and prevent rust epiphytotics.

"22407351","abstracttext","The ability of wheat to maintain a low sodium concentration ([Na(+)]) in leaves correlates with improved growth under saline conditions. This trait, termed Na(+) exclusion, contributes to the greater salt tolerance of bread wheat relative to durum wheat. To improve the salt tolerance of durum wheat, we explored natural diversity in shoot Na(+) exclusion within ancestral wheat germplasm. Previously, we showed that crossing of Nax2, a gene locus in the wheat relative Triticum monococcum into a commercial durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum var. Tamaroi) reduced its leaf [Na(+)] (ref. 5). Here we show that a gene in the Nax2 locus, TmHKT1;5-A, encodes a Na(+)-selective transporter located on the plasma membrane of root cells surrounding xylem vessels, which is therefore ideally localized to withdraw Na(+) from the xylem and reduce transport of Na(+) to leaves. Field trials on saline soils demonstrate that the presence of TmHKT1;5-A significantly reduces leaf [Na(+)] and increases durum wheat grain yield by 25% compared to near-isogenic lines without the Nax2 locus."

"15558228","abstracttext","Genetic control of herbage quality variation was assessed through the use of the molecular marker-based reference genetic map of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and genomic DNA-derived simple sequence repeat-based (SSR) framework marker set was enhanced, with RFLP loci corresponding to genes for key enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis and fructan metabolism. Quality traits such as crude protein (CP) content, estimated in vivo dry matter digestibility (IVVDMD), neutral detergent fibre content (NDF), estimated metabolisable energy (EstME) and water soluble carbohydrate (WSC) content were measured by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) analysis of herbage harvests. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis was performed using single-marker regression, simple interval mapping and composite interval mapping approaches, detecting a total of 42 QTLs from six different sampling experiments varying by developmental stage (anthesis or vegetative growth), location or year. Coincident QTLs were detected on linkage groups (LGs) 3, 5 and 7. The region on LG3 was associated with variation for all measured traits across various experimental datasets. The region on LG7 was associated with variation for all traits except CP, and is located in the vicinity of the lignin biosynthesis gene loci xlpomt1 (caffeic acid-O-methyltransferase), xlpccr1 (cinnamoyl CoA-reductase) and xlpssrcad 2.1 (cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase). Comparative genomics analysis of these gene classes with wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) provides evidence for conservation of gene order over evolutionary time and the basis for cross-specific genetic information transfer. The identification of co-location between QTLs and functionally associated genetic markers is critical for the implementation of marker-assisted selection programs and for linkage disequilibrium studies, which will enable future improvement strategies for perennial ryegrass."

"12011348","abstracttext","Expression of the fis1 gene from flax (Linum usitatissimum) is induced by a compatible rust (Melampsora lini) infection. Infection of transgenic plants containing a beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene under the control of the fis1 promoter showed that induction is highly localized to those leaf mesophyll cells within and immediately surrounding rust infection sites. The level of induction reflects the extent of fungal growth. In a strong resistance reaction, such as the hypersensitive fleck mediated by the L6 resistance gene, there is very little fungal growth and a microscopic level of GUS expression. Partially resistant flax leaves show levels of GUS expression that were intermediate to the level observed in the fully susceptible infection. Sequence and deletion analysis using both transient Agrobacterium tumefaciens expression and stable transformation assays have shown that the rust-inducible fis1 promoter is contained within a 580-bp fragment. Homologs of fis1 were identified in expressed sequence tag databases of a range of plant species including dicots, monocots, and a gymnosperm. Homologous genes isolated from maize (Zea mays; mis1), barley (Hordeum vulgare; bis1), wheat (Triticum aestivum; wis1), and Arabidopsis encode proteins that are highly similar (76%-82%) to the FIS1 protein. The Arabidopsis homologue has been reported to encode a delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase that is involved in the catabolism of proline to glutamate. RNA-blot analysis showed that mis1 in maize and the bis1 homolog in barley are both up-regulated by a compatible infection with the corresponding species-specific rust. The rust-induced genes homologous to fis1 are present in many plants. The promoters of these genes have potential roles for the engineering of synthetic rust resistance genes by targeting transgene expression to the sites of rust infection."
"12692345","articletitle","The evolution of CONSTANS-like gene families in barley, rice, and Arabidopsis."
"12692345","abstracttext","The CO (CONSTANS) gene of Arabidopsis has an important role in the regulation of flowering by photoperiod. CO is part of a gene family with 17 members that are subdivided into three classes, termed Group I to III here. All members of the family have a CCT (CO, CO-like, TOC1) domain near the carboxy terminus. Group I genes, which include CO, have two zinc finger B-boxes near the amino terminus. Group II genes have one B-box, and Group III genes have one B-box and a second diverged zinc finger. Analysis of rice (Oryza sativa) genomic sequence identified 16 genes (OsA-OsP) that were also divided into these three groups, showing that their evolution predates monocot/dicot divergence. Eight Group I genes (HvCO1-HvCO8) were isolated from barley (Hordeum vulgare), of which two (HvCO1 and HvCO2) were highly CO like. HvCO3 and its rice counterpart (OsB) had one B-box that was distantly related to Group II genes and was probably derived by internal deletion of a two B-box Group I gene. Sequence homology and comparative mapping showed that HvCO1 was the counterpart of OsA (Hd1), a major determinant of photoperiod sensitivity in rice. Major genes determining photoperiod response have been mapped in barley and wheat (Triticum aestivum), but none corresponded to CO-like genes. Thus, selection for variation in photoperiod response has affected different genes in rice and temperate cereals. The peptides of HvCO1, HvCO2 (barley), and Hd1 (rice) show significant structural differences from CO, particularly amino acid changes that are predicted to abolish B-box2 function, suggesting an evolutionary trend toward a one-B-box structure in the most CO-like cereal genes."

"15020760","abstracttext","In recent years, access to complete genomic sequences, coupled with rapidly accumulating data related to RNA and protein expression patterns, has made it possible to determine comprehensively how genes contribute to complex phenotypes. However, for major crop plants, publicly available, standard platforms for parallel expression analysis have been limited. We report the conception and design of the new publicly available, 22K Barley1 GeneChip probe array, a model for plants without a fully sequenced genome. Array content was derived from worldwide contribution of 350,000 high-quality ESTs from 84 cDNA libraries, in addition to 1,145 barley (Hordeum vulgare) gene sequences from the National Center for Biotechnology Information nonredundant database. Conserved sequences expressed in seedlings of wheat (Triticum aestivum), oat (Avena strigosa), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and maize (Zea mays) were identified that will be valuable in the design of arrays across grasses. To enhance the usability of the data, BarleyBase, a MIAME-compliant, MySQL relational database, serves as a public repository for raw and normalized expression data from the Barley1 GeneChip probe array. Interconnecting links with PlantGDB and Gramene allow BarleyBase users to perform gene predictions using the 21,439 non-redundant Barley1 exemplar sequences or cross-species comparison at the genome level, respectively. We expect that this first generation array will accelerate hypothesis generation and gene discovery in disease defense pathways, responses to abiotic stresses, development, and evolutionary diversity in monocot plants."

"19011003","abstracttext","Plant disease resistance governed by quantitative trait loci (QTL) is predicted to be effective against a broad spectrum of pathogens and long lasting. Use of these QTL to improve crop species, however, is hindered because the genes contributing to the trait are not known. Five disease resistance QTL that colocalized with defense response genes were accumulated by marker-aided selection to develop blast-resistant varieties. One advanced backcross line carrying the major-effect QTL on chromosome (chr) 8, which included a cluster of 12 germin-like protein (OsGLP) gene members, exhibited resistance to rice (Oryza sativa) blast disease over 14 cropping seasons. To determine if OsGLP members contribute to resistance and if the resistance was broad spectrum, a highly conserved portion of the OsGLP coding region was used as an RNA interference trigger to silence a few to all expressed chr 8 OsGLP family members. Challenge with two different fungal pathogens (causal agents of rice blast and sheath blight diseases) revealed that as more chr 8 OsGLP genes were suppressed, disease susceptibility of the plants increased. Of the 12 chr 8 OsGLPs, one clustered subfamily (OsGER4) contributed most to resistance. The similarities of sequence, gene organization, and roles in disease resistance of GLP family members in rice and other cereals, including barley (Hordeum vulgare) and wheat (Triticum aestivum), suggest that resistance contributed by the chr 8 OsGLP is a broad-spectrum, basal mechanism conserved among the Gramineae. Natural selection may have preserved a whole gene family to provide a stepwise, flexible defense response to pathogen invasion."
"17569029","articletitle","Using genotype x nitrogen interaction variables to evaluate the QTL involved in wheat tolerance to nitrogen constraints."
"17569029","abstracttext","Lower market prices and environmental concerns now orientate wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding programs towards low input agricultural practices, and more particularly low nitrogen (N) input management. Such programs require knowledge of the genetic determination of plant reaction to N deficiency. Our aim was to characterize the genetic basis of N use efficiency and genotype x N interactions. The detection of QTL for grain yield, grain protein yield and their components was performed on a mapping population of 222 doubled haploid lines (DH), obtained from the cross between an N stress tolerant variety and an N stress sensitive variety. Experiments on the population were carried out in seven different environments, and in each case under high (N(+)) and low (N(-)) N supplies. In total, 233 QTL were detected for traits measured in each combination of environment and N supply, for ""global"" interaction variables (N(+)-N(-) and N(-)/N(+)), for sensitivity to N stress and for performance under N-limited conditions which were assessed using factorial regression parameters. The 233 QTL were detected on the whole genome and clustered into 82 genome regions. The dwarfing gene (Rht-B1), the photoperiod sensitivity gene (Ppd-D1) and the awns inhibitor gene (B1) coincided with regions that contained the highest numbers of QTL. Non-interactive QTL were detected on linkage groups 3D, 4B, 5A1 and 7B2. Interactive QTL were revealed by interaction or factorial regression variables (2D2, 3D, 5A1, 5D, 6A, 6B, 7B2) or by both variables (1B, 2A1, 2A2, 2D1, 4B, 5A2, 5B). The usefulness of QTL meta-analysis and factorial regression to study QTL x N interactions and the impact of Rht-B1, Ppd-D1 and B1, are discussed."

"24162198","abstracttext","Three new major, race-specific, resistance genes to powdery mildew (Erysiphe graminis f. sp. hordei) were identified in three barley lines, 'RS42-6*O', 'RS137-28*E', and 'HSY-78*A', derived from crosses with wild barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. spontaneum). The resistance gene origining from wild barley in line 'RS42-6*O', showed a recessive mode of inheritance, whereas the other wild barley genes were (semi)-dominant. RFLP mapping of these three genes was performed in segregating F2 populations. The recessive gene in line 'RS42-6*O', was localized on barley chromosome 1S (7HS), while the (semi)-dominant genes in lines 'RS137-28*E', and 'HSY-78*A', were localized on chromosomes 1L (7HL) and 7L (5HL), respectively. Closely linked RFLP clones mapped at distances between 2.6cM and 5.3 cM. Hitherto, specific loci for powdery mildew resistance in barley had not been located on these chromosomes. Furthermore, tests for linkage to the unlocalized resistance gene Mlp revealed free segregation. Therefore, these genes represent new loci and new designations are suggested: mlt ('RS42-6*O'), Mlf ('RS137-28*E'), and Mlj ('HSY-78*A'). Comparisons with mapped QTLs for mildew resistance were made and are discussed in the context of homoeology among the genomes of barley (H-vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and rye (Secale cereale). Duplications of RFLP bands detected in the neighbourhood of Mlf and mlt might indicate an evolutionary interrelationship to the Mla locus for mildew resistance."

Dewey, or Th. junceum (L.) A. Löve, were assayed for resistance to BYDV serotype PAV by slot-blot hybridization with viral cDNA of a partial coat protein gene. Three immune lines were found among seven partial amphiploids involving Th. ponticum. Seven highly resistant lines were found in ten partial amphiploids involving Th. intermedium. None of eight partial amphiploids or 13 addition lines of Chinese Spring - Th. junceum were resistant to BYDV. Genomic in situ hybridization demonstrated that all of the resistant partial amphiploids, except TAF46, carried an alien genome most closely related to St, whether it was derived from Th. ponticum or Th. intermedium. The two partial amphiploids carrying an intact E genome of Th. ponticum are very susceptible to BYDV-PAV. In TAF46, which contains three pairs of St- and four pairs of E-genome chromo somes, the gene for BYDV resistance has been located to a modified 7 St chromosome in the addition line L1. This indicates that BYDV resistance in perennial polyploid parents, i.e., Th. ponticum and Th. intermedium, of these partial amphiploids is probably controlled by a gene(s) located on the St-genome chromosome(s)."

"28522548","abstracttext","We report a comprehensive toolkit that enables targeted, specific modification of monocot and dicot genomes using a variety of genome engineering approaches. Our reagents, based on transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 system, are systematized for fast, modular cloning and accommodate diverse regulatory sequences to drive reagent expression. Vectors are optimized to create either single or multiple gene knockouts and large chromosomal deletions. Moreover, integration of geminivirus-based vectors enables precise gene editing through homologous recombination. Regulation of transcription is also possible. A Web-based tool streamlines vector selection and construction. One advantage of our platform is the use of the Csy-type (CRISPR system yersinia) ribonuclease 4 (Csy4) and tRNA processing enzymes to simultaneously express multiple guide RNAs (gRNAs). For example, we demonstrate targeted deletions in up to six genes by expressing 12 gRNAs from a single transcript. Csy4 and tRNA expression systems are almost twice as effective in inducing mutations as gRNAs expressed from individual RNA polymerase III promoters. Mutagenesis can be further enhanced 2.5-fold by incorporating the Trex2 exonuclease. Finally, we demonstrate that Cas9 nickases induce gene targeting at frequencies comparable to native Cas9 when they are delivered on geminivirus replicons. The reagents have been successfully validated in tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum ), tobacco ( Nicotiana tabacum ), Medicago truncatula , wheat ( Triticum aestivum ), and barley ( Hordeum vulgare )."

Plant species included in this review are Arabidopsis thaliana, cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana and N. tabacum), soybean (Glycine max), rice (Oryza sativa), blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), wheat (Triticum aestivum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), sugar cane (Saccharum sp.), carrot (Daucus carota), coffee (Coffea arabica), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), kiwi (Actinidia deliciosa) and grape (Vitis vinifera). The list includes model and cultivated crop plants from both monocot and dicot classes. We have categorized plant-wise the reference genes that have been used for expression analyses in any or all of the four different conditions such as biotic stress, abiotic stress, developmental stages and various organs and tissues, reported till date.

"29740462","articletitle","Wheat F-Box Protein Gene TaFBA1 Is Involved in Plant Tolerance to Heat Stress."
"29740462","abstracttext","Adverse environmental conditions, including high temperature, often affect the growth and production of crops worldwide. F-box protein, a core component of the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) E3 ligase complex, plays an important role in abiotic stress responses. A previously cloned gene from wheat, TaFBA1 , encodes a homologous F-box protein. A Yeast two-Hybrid (Y2H) assay showed that TaFBA1 interacted with other SCF proteins. We found that the expression of TaFBA1 could be induced by heat stress (45°C). Overexpression of TaFBA1 enhanced heat stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco, because growth inhibition was reduced and photosynthesis increased as compared with those in the wild type (WT) plants. Furthermore, the accumulation of H 2 O 2 , O 2 - , and carbonyl protein decreased and cell damage was alleviated in transgenic plants under heat stress, which resulted in less oxidative damage. However, the transgenic plants contained more enzymatic antioxidants after heat stress, which might be related to the regulation of some antioxidant gene expressions. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that the overexpression of TaFBA1 upregulated the expression of genes involved in reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, proline biosynthesis, and abiotic stress responses. We identified the interaction of TaFBA1 with Triticum aestivum stress responsive protein 1 (TaASRP1) by Y2H assay and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assay. The results suggested that TaFBA1 may improve enzymatic antioxidant levels and regulate gene expression by interacting with other proteins, such as TaASRP1, which leads to the enhanced heat stress tolerance seen in the transgenic plants."

"31571294","articletitle","Uncovering the evolutionary origin of blue anthocyanins in cereal grains."
"31571294","abstracttext","Functional divergence after gene duplication plays a central role in plant evolution. Among cereals, only Hordeum vulgare (barley), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Secale cereale (rye) accumulate delphinidin-derived (blue) anthocyanins in the aleurone layer of grains, whereas Oryza sativa (rice), Zea mays (maize) and Sorghum bicolor (sorghum) do not. The underlying genetic basis for this natural occurrence remains elusive. Here, we mapped the barley Blx1 locus involved in blue aleurone to an approximately 1.13 Mb genetic interval on chromosome 4HL, thus identifying a trigenic cluster named MbHF35 (containing HvMYB4H, HvMYC4H and HvF35H). Sequence and expression data supported the role of these genes in conferring blue-coloured (blue aleurone) grains. Synteny analyses across monocot species showed that MbHF35 has only evolved within distinct Triticeae lineages, as a result of dispersed gene duplication. Phylogeny analyses revealed a shared evolution pattern for MbHF35 in Triticeae, suggesting that these genes have co-evolved together. We also identified a Pooideae-specific flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) lineage, termed here Mo_F35H2, which has a higher amino acid similarity with eudicot F3'5'Hs, demonstrating a scenario of convergent evolution. Indeed, selection tests identified 13 amino acid residues in Mo_F35H2 that underwent positive selection, possibly driven by protein thermostablility selection. Furthermore, through the interrogation of barley germplasm there is evidence that HvMYB4H and HvMYC4H have undergone human selection. Collectively, our study favours blue aleurone as a recently evolved trait resulting from environmental adaptation. Our findings provide an evolutionary explanation for the absence of blue anthocyanins in other cereals and highlight the importance of gene functional divergence for plant diversity and environmental adaptation."

In this study, a novel actinobacteria with broad-spectrum antifungal activity, designated strain NEAU-H2 T , was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain NEAU-H2 T belonged to the genus Streptomyces , with high sequence similarities to Streptomyces rhizosphaerihabitans NBRC 109807 T (98.8%), Streptomyces populi A249 T (98.6%), and Streptomyces siamensis NBRC 108799 T (98.6%). Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA, atpD , gyrB , recA , rpoB , and trpB gene sequences showed that the strain formed a stable clade with S. populi A249 T . Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics of the strain coincided with members of the genus Streptomyces . A combination of DNA-DNA hybridization results and phenotypic properties indicated that the strain could be distinguished from the abovementioned strains. Thus, strain NEAU-H2 T belongs to a novel species in the genus Streptomyces , for which the name Streptomyces triticiradicis sp. nov. is proposed. In addition, the metabolites isolated from cultures of strain NEAU-H2 T were characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. One new compound and three known congeners were isolated. Further, genome analysis revealed that the strain harbored diverse biosynthetic potential, and one cluster showing 63% similarity to natamycin biosynthetic gene cluster may contribute to the antifungal activity. The type strain is NEAU-H2 T (= CCTCC AA 2018031 T = DSM 109825 T )."

"26555672","abstracttext","Blast, caused by Pyricularia oryzae, is one of the major diseases of wheat in South America. We identified a new gene for resistance to Triticum isolates of P. oryzae in common wheat 'S-615', and designated it ""resistance to Magnaporthe grisea 8"" (Rmg8). Rmg8 was assigned to chromosome 2B through molecular mapping with simple-sequence repeat markers. To identify an avirulence gene corresponding to Rmg8, Triticum isolate Br48 (avirulent on S-615) was crossed with 200R29 (virulent on S-615), an F1 progeny derived from a cross between an Eleusine isolate (MZ5-1-6) and Br48. Segregation analysis of their progeny revealed that avirulence of Br48 on S-615 was conditioned by a single gene, which was designated AVR-Rmg8. AVR-Rmg8 was closely linked to AVR-Rmg7, which corresponded to Rmg7 located on chromosome 2A of tetraploid wheat."

"30673391","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is a serious disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) throughout the world. Host resistance is the most effective and preferred means for managing this disease. Line 10V-2, a wheat breeding line with superior agronomic performance, shows broad-spectrum seedling resistance to powdery mildew. Genetic analysis demonstrated that its resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene, tentatively designated Pm10V-2. This gene was localized near the documented Pm2 locus on chromosome 5DS using the simple sequence repeat (SSR) marker Cfd81. To saturate the marker map of Pm10V-2, more markers were developed using bulked segregant RNA-Seq. Two single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers (Swgi047 and Swgi064), three expressed sequence tag markers (Swgi007, Swgi029, and Swgi038), and one SSR marker (Swgi066) were polymorphic between the resistant and susceptible bulks and showed tightly linked to the Pm10V-2 gene. Pm10V-2 was flanked by the new developed markers Swgi064 and Swgi066 at genetic distances of 0.4 and 1.2 centimorgans (cM), respectively, and cosegregated with Swgi007 and Swgi038. The homologous sequence of Pm2a was cloned from 10V-2 based on a recent study. Although the sequence cloned from 10V-2 was completely identical to that of the reported Pm2a-related gene, they did not cosegregate but were separated at a genetic distance of 1.6 cM, indicating that Pm10V-2 was different from the reported of Pm2a-related gene. When inoculated with multiple B. graminis f. sp. tritici isolates, Pm10V-2 had a significantly different resistance spectrum from Pm2a and other powdery mildew (Pm) resistance genes at or near the Pm2 locus. Therefore, Pm10V-2 may be a new Pm2 allele or Pm2-linked gene. To use Pm10V-2 in marker-assisted selection (MAS) breeding, seven markers applicable for MAS were confirmed, including three newly developed markers (Swgi029, Swgi038, and Swgi064) in the present work. Using these markers, a great number of resistant lines with desirable agronomic performance were selected from crosses involving 10V-2, including the breeding line KM5016, which has been entered in the Regional trials in Hebei Province, China."

Four DNA constructs harboring the CAT gene and the 35S or mannipine synthase promoter were tested for levels of CAT activity 40-45 hr after electroporation of protoplasts. One construct, containing a maize intron sequence between 35S and CAT sequences, conferred 30 to 185 fold greater CAT activity over the other three constructs. Data from these experiments suggest that a maize intron or sequences with similar effects may be required in DNA constructs for efficient heterologous gene expression in cultured cells of breadwheat."

"7534497","abstracttext","An alloplasmic hybrid (nucleus-cytoplasm hybrid) of common wheat (Triticum aestivum) with a cytoplasm of wheatgrass (Agropyron trichophorum) shows highly depressed vigor and complete male sterility. The presence of one short-arm telocentric homeologous group 1 chromosome (telosome) of the cytoplasm donor, however, restores normal vigor and male fertility of the hybrid. To study role(s) of the telosome on vigor/fertility restoration, mitochondrial genome organization and gene expression were compared among seedlings of the alloplasmic line showing depressed vigor, the corresponding restored line having a pair of the telosomes, and a euplasmic nuclear donor as control. No differences were detected in the mitochondrial genome structure between the depressed line and the restored line. Northern blot analysis using ten mitochondrial genes as probes showed no differences in transcript size and number between the depressed and restored lines, although clear differences were found in size of the major transcripts of two genes (cob and orf25) between the alloplasmic lines and the euplasmic control. Steady-state transcript levels were higher in the depressed line than in the other lines for all the mitochondrial genes analyzed including rrn18&5 when the same amount of mitochondrial RNA was loaded. The amount of rrn18&5 transcript in the total cellular RNA, however, did not differ among the lines. Run-on transcription analysis demonstrated markedly elevated transcriptional activities of all the mitochondrial genes analyzed in the depressed line based on unit amount of mitochondrial DNA, RNA and protein. The presence of Agropyron telosomes apparently normalized the level of mitochondrial transcription. These observations suggest either direct or indirect association of the observed mitochondrial gene overexpression with the depressed vigor and male sterility of the alloplasmic hybrid."

"11244113","abstracttext","The small genome of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench.) provides an important template for study of closely related large-genome crops such as maize (Zea mays) and sugarcane (Saccharum spp.), and is a logical complement to distantly related rice (Oryza sativa) as a ""grass genome model."" Using a high-density RFLP map as a framework, a robust physical map of sorghum is being assembled by integrating hybridization and fingerprint data with comparative data from related taxa such as rice and using new methods to resolve genomic duplications into locus-specific groups. By taking advantage of allelic variation revealed by heterologous probes, the positions of corresponding loci on the wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice, maize, sugarcane, and Arabidopsis genomes are being interpolated on the sorghum physical map. Bacterial artificial chromosomes for the small genome of rice are shown to close several gaps in the sorghum contigs; the emerging rice physical map and assembled sequence will further accelerate progress. An important motivation for developing genomic tools is to relate molecular level variation to phenotypic diversity. ""Diversity maps,"" which depict the levels and patterns of variation in different gene pools, shed light on relationships of allelic diversity with chromosome organization, and suggest possible locations of genomic regions that are under selection due to major gene effects (some of which may be revealed by quantitative trait locus mapping). Both physical maps and diversity maps suggest interesting features that may be integrally related to the chromosomal context of DNA-progress in cytology promises to provide a means to elucidate such relationships. We seek to provide a detailed picture of the structure, function, and evolution of the genome of sorghum and its relatives, together with molecular tools such as locus-specific sequence-tagged site DNA markers and bacterial artificial chromosome contigs that will have enduring value for many aspects of genome analysis."

"11457951","abstracttext","O-Acetylserine(thiol) lyase (OASTL), a key enzyme of plant sulfur metabolism, catalyzes the formation of Cys from sulfide and O-acetylserine. The biosynthesis of Cys is regarded as the exclusive function of sulfur reduction in plants, and a key limiting step in the production of glutathione (GSH), a thiol implicated in various cellular functions, including sulfur transport, gene expression, scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses. To examine whether an increased capacity for cysteine (Cys) biosynthesis alters cellular responses to such stresses, we studied the differential changes in thiol levels and ROS scavenging of transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) plants expressing the wheat (Triticum aestivum) OASTL gene, cys1, to SO(2) and to the ROS generator, methyl viologen. Intracellular Cys and GSH contents were generally higher in cys1 transgenics than in controls under normal growth conditions, but became especially elevated in transgenic plants after SO(2) exposure. An examination of differences in the ROS scavenging system of the transgenic plants also demonstrated the specific accumulation of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase transcripts, known to be induced by Cys or GSH, and elevated cellular superoxide dismutase activities. The transgenic plants accordingly showed dramatic reductions in the extent of both foliar and photooxidative damage in response to acute SO(2), as well as reduced levels of chlorosis and membrane damage following methyl viologen treatment. Overall, our results imply that OASTL plays a pivotal role in the synthesis of Cys and GSH that are required for regulation of plant responses to oxidative stress."

"10972894","abstracttext","Three large-insert genomic DNA libraries of common wheat, Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring, were constructed in a newly developed transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) vector, pYLTAC17, which accepts and maintains large genomic DNA fragments stably in both Escherichia coli and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The vector contains the cis sequence required for Agrobacterium-mediated gene transfer into grasses. The average insert sizes of the three genomic libraries were approximately 46, 65 and 120 kbp, covering three haploid genome equivalents. Genomic libraries were stored as frozen cultures in a 96-well format, each well containing approximately 300-600 colonies (12 plates for small library, four for medium-size library and four for large library). In each of the libraries, approximately 80% of the colonies harbored genomic DNA inserts of >50 kbp. TAC clones containing gene(s) of interest were identified by the pooled PCR technique. Once the target TAC clones were isolated, they could be immediately transferred into grass genomes with the Agrobacterium system. Five clones containing the thionin type I genes (single copy per genome), corresponding to each of the three genomes (A, B and D), were successfully selected by the pooled PCR method, in addition to an STS marker (aWG464; single copy per genome) and CAB (a multigene family). TAC libraries constructed as described here can be used to isolate genomic clones containing target genes, and to carry out genome walking for positional cloning."

"15627242","abstracttext","Imidazolinone herbicides, which include imazapyr, imazapic, imazethapyr, imazamox, imazamethabenz and imazaquin, control weeds by inhibiting the enzyme acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), also called acetolactate synthase (ALS). AHAS is a critical enzyme for the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids in plants. Several variant AHAS genes conferring imidazolinone tolerance were discovered in plants through mutagenesis and selection, and were used to create imidazolinone-tolerant maize (Zea mays L), wheat (Triticum aestivum L), rice (Oryza sativa L), oilseed rape (Brassica napus L) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L). These crops were developed using conventional breeding methods and commercialized as Clearfield* crops from 1992 to the present. Imidazolinone herbicides control a broad spectrum of grass and broadleaf weeds in imidazolinone-tolerant crops, including weeds that are closely related to the crop itself and some key parasitic weeds. Imidazolinone-tolerant crops may also prevent rotational crop injury and injury caused by interaction between AHAS-inhibiting herbicides and insecticides. A single target-site mutation in the AHAS gene may confer tolerance to AHAS-inhibiting herbicides, so that it is technically possible to develop the imidazolinone-tolerance trait in many crops. Activities are currently directed toward the continued improvement of imidazolinone tolerance and development of new Clearfield* crops. Management of herbicide-resistant weeds and gene flow from crops to weeds are issues that must be considered with the development of any herbicide-resistant crop. Thus extensive stewardship programs have been developed to address these issues for Clearfield* crops."

"12857801","abstracttext","The involvement of calcium and calcium-activated calmodulin (Ca(2+)-CaM) in heat shock (HS) signal transduction in wheat (Triticum aestivum) was investigated. Using Fluo-3/acetoxymethyl esters and laser scanning confocal microscopy, it was found that the increase of intracellular free calcium ion concentration started within 1 min after a 37 degrees C HS. The levels of CaM mRNA and protein increased during HS at 37 degrees C in the presence of Ca(2+). The expression of hsp26 and hsp70 genes was up-regulated by the addition of CaCl(2) and down-regulated by the calcium ion chelator EGTA, the calcium ion channel blockers LaCl(3) and verapamil, or the CaM antagonists N-(6-aminohexyl)-5-chloro-1-naphthalenesulfonamide and chlorpromazine. Treatment with Ca(2+) also increased, and with EGTA, verapamil, chlorpromazine, or trifluoperazine decreased, synthesis of HS proteins. The temporal expression of the CaM1-2 gene and the hsp26 and hsp70 genes demonstrated that up-regulation of the CaM1-2 gene occurred at 10 min after HS at 37 degrees C, whereas that of hsp26 and hsp70 appeared at 20 min after HS. A 5-min HS induced expression of hsp26 after a period of recovery at 22 degrees C after HS at 37 degrees C. Taken together, these results indicate that Ca(2+)-CaM is directly involved in the HS signal transduction pathway. A working hypothesis about the relationship between upstream and downstream of HS signal transduction is presented."

"16022335","abstracttext","Interactions between biotype E greenbugs, Schizaphis graminum (Rodani), and two near isogenic lines of the greenbug resistance gene Gb3 of wheat, Triticum aestivum L., were examined for 62 d after infestation. By comparing aphid performance and host responses on control and greenbug-preconditioned plants, we demonstrated that systemic resistance to greenbug herbivory was inducible in the resistant genotype with varying intensities and effectiveness in different parts of the plants. Preconditioning of susceptible plants resulted in modification of within-plant aphid distribution and reduction of cumulative greenbug densities, but it showed no effect on reducing greenbug feeding damage to host plant. Preconditioning of resistant plants altered greenbug population dynamics by reducing the size and buffering the fluctuation of the aphid population. Preconditioning in the first (oldest) leaf of the resistant plant had no phenotypically detectable effect in the stem and induced susceptibility locally in the first leaf within the first 2 d after infestation. The preconditioning-induced resistance reduced greenbug density, delayed aphid density peaks and extended the life of younger leaves in resistant plants. Expression of induced resistance was spatially and temporally dynamic within the plant, which occurred more rapidly, was longer in duration, and stronger in intensity in younger leaves. Host resistance gene-mediated induced resistance was effective in lowering greenbug performance and reducing damage from greenbug herbivory in host plants. Results from this study supported the optimal defense theory regarding within-plant defense allocation."

"15888683","abstracttext","To better understand the molecular basis of the defense response against the rice blast fungus (Magnaporthe grisea), a large-scale expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing approach was used to identify genes involved in the early infection stages in rice (Oryza sativa). Six cDNA libraries were constructed using infected leaf tissues harvested from 6 conditions: resistant, partially resistant, and susceptible reactions at both 6 and 24 h after inoculation. Two additional libraries were constructed using uninoculated leaves and leaves from the lesion mimic mutant spl11. A total of 68,920 ESTs were generated from 8 libraries. Clustering and assembly analyses resulted in 13,570 unique sequences from 10,934 contigs and 2,636 singletons. Gene function classification showed that 42% of the ESTs were predicted to have putative gene function. Comparison of the pathogen-challenged libraries with the uninoculated control library revealed an increase in the percentage of genes in the functional categories of defense and signal transduction mechanisms and cell cycle control, cell division, and chromosome partitioning. In addition, hierarchical clustering analysis grouped the eight libraries based on their disease reactions. A total of 7,748 new and unique ESTs were identified from our collection compared with the KOME full-length cDNA collection. Interestingly, we found that rice ESTs are more closely related to sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) ESTs than to barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays) ESTs. The large cataloged collection of rice ESTs in this study provides a solid foundation for further characterization of the rice defense response and is a useful public genomic resource for rice functional genomics studies."

"18516686","abstracttext","To investigate the crosstalk of abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellin (GA) signaling in wheat (Triticum aestivum), we have focused on the transcription factor TaABF1. TaABF1 (a member of the ABA response element binding factor family) physically interacts with PKABA1, a signaling component in the ABA-suppression of GA-induced gene expression in cereal grains. Constitutive expression of TaABF1 in aleurone cells of imbibing grains completely eliminated GA-induced expression from the Amy32b promoter. In addition to its effect on Amy32b, TaABF1 strongly stimulated expression from the ABA-inducible HVA1 and HVA22 promoters. Overexpression of TaABF1 fully substituted for exogenous ABA in the induction of these two promoters. The introduction of a construct directing RNA inhibition (RNAi) of TaABF1 did not prevent either ABA-mediated or PKABA1-mediated suppression of Amy32b expression. Similarly, the RNAi construct did not prevent ABA-induction of HVA1. These results suggest that another protein may act redundantly with TaABF1 during cereal imbibition. Although TaABF1 mRNA was downregulated during imbibition of afterripened grains, transcript levels were not significantly altered by exogenous GA or ABA, suggesting that upregulation of TaABF1 at the mRNA level is not required for its role in ABA signaling. We propose a model in which TaABF1 is involved in two separate branches of ABA signaling. In this model, TaABF1 acts downstream of PKABA1 in ABA-suppression of GA-induced gene expression, and participates (independently of PKABA1) in the stimulation of ABA-induced genes."

"15060581","abstracttext","Cultivated rye (Secale cereale L., 2n = 2x = 14, RR) is an important source of genes for insect and disease resistance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L., 2n = 6x = 42). Rye chromosome arm 1RS of S. cereale 'Kavkaz' originally found as a 1BL.1RS translocation, carries genes for disease resistance (e.g., Lr26, Sr31, Yr9, and Pm8), while 1RS of the S. cereale 'Amigo' translocation (1RSA) carries a single resistance gene for greenbug (Schizaphis graminum Rondani) biotypes B and C and also carries additional disease-resistance genes. The purpose of this research was to identify individual plants that were recombinant in the homologous region of.1AL.1RSV and 1AL.1RSA using both molecular and phenotypic markers. Secale cereale 'Nekota' (1AL.1RSA) and S. cereale 'Pavon 76' (1AL.1RSV) were mated and the F1 was backcrossed to 'Nekota' (1AL.1AS) to generate eighty BC1F2:3 families (i.e., ('Nekota' 1AL.1RSA x 'Pavon 76' 1AL.1RSV) x 'Nekota' 1AL.1AS). These families were genotyped using the secalin-gliadin grain storage protein banding pattern generated with polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to discriminate 1AL.1AS/1AL.1RS heterozygotes from the 1AL.1RSA+V and 1AL.1AS homozygotes. Segregation of the secalin locus and PCR markers based on the R173 family of rye specific repeated DNA sequences demonstrated the presence of recombinant 1AL.1RSA+V families. Powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis) and greenbug resistance genes on the recombinant 1RSA+V arm were mapped in relation to the Sec-1 locus, 2 additional protein bands, 3 SSRs, and 13 RFLP markers. The resultant linkage map of 1RS spanned 82.4 cM with marker order and spacing showing reasonable agreement with previous maps of 1RS. Fifteen markers lie within a region of 29.7 cM next to the centromere, yet corresponded to just 36% of the overall map length. The map position of the RFLP marker probe mwg68 was 10.9 cM distal to the Sec-1 locus and 7.8 cM proximal to the powdery mildew resistance locus. The greenbug resistance gene was located 2.7 cM proximal to the Sec-1 locus."
"16306142","articletitle","Identification, expression, and evolutionary analyses of plant lipocalins."
"16306142","abstracttext","Lipocalins are a group of proteins that have been characterized in bacteria, invertebrate, and vertebrate animals. However, very little is known about plant lipocalins. We have previously reported the cloning of the first true plant lipocalins. Here we report the identification and characterization of plant lipocalins and lipocalin-like proteins using an integrated approach of data mining, expression studies, cellular localization, and phylogenetic analyses. Plant lipocalins can be classified into two groups, temperature-induced lipocalins (TILs) and chloroplastic lipocalins (CHLs). In addition, violaxanthin de-epoxidases (VDEs) and zeaxanthin epoxidases (ZEPs) can be classified as lipocalin-like proteins. CHLs, VDEs, and ZEPs possess transit peptides that target them to the chloroplast. On the other hand, TILs do not show any targeting peptide, but localization studies revealed that the proteins are found at the plasma membrane. Expression analyses by quantitative real-time PCR showed that expression of the wheat (Triticum aestivum) lipocalins and lipocalin-like proteins is associated with abiotic stress response and is correlated with the plant's capacity to develop freezing tolerance. In support of this correlation, data mining revealed that lipocalins are present in the desiccation-tolerant red algae Porphyra yezoensis and the cryotolerant marine yeast Debaryomyces hansenii, suggesting a possible association with stress-tolerant organisms. Considering the plant lipocalin properties, tissue specificity, response to temperature stress, and their association with chloroplasts and plasma membranes of green leaves, we hypothesize a protective function of the photosynthetic system against temperature stress. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that TIL lipocalin members in higher plants were probably inherited from a bacterial gene present in a primitive unicellular eukaryote. On the other hand, CHLs, VDEs, and ZEPs may have evolved from a cyanobacterial ancestral gene after the formation of the cyanobacterial endosymbiont from which the chloroplast originated."

"18942998","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Wheat (Triticum aestivum) cvs. Libellula (LB), San Pastore (SP), and Xian Nong 4 (XN4) possess durable resistance to stripe rust, caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, and cv. Ming Xian 169 (MX169) is highly susceptible to the rust. Inheritance of stripe rust resistance was studied by crossing the four cultivars and evaluating the resistance of parental, F(1), F(2), backcross, and F(3) plants in the fields. Transgressive segregation for resistance was observed in the resistant by resistant crosses of LB x XN4 and XN4 x SP, but not in cross LB x SP. These results indicate that (i) the resistance genes in XN4 are different from those in LB and SP, and (ii) LB and SP share common resistance genes. The number of genes segregating for the resistance was estimated by quantitative methods from the data of F(2), backcross, and F(3) populations. LB and XN4 appear to have two to three resistance genes, and SP appears to have two to four resistance genes when crossed with MX169. The resistance gene number in resistant by resistant cross LB x XN4 was four to five, approximately equal to the sum of the genes in LB and XN4. Similarly, the resistance gene number in cross XN4 x SP was approximately equal to the sum of the genes in XN4 and SP. Broad-sense heritability was high in all crosses except LB x SP. Compared with the three MX169-involved crosses, narrow-sense heritability was higher in LB x MX169 and SP x MX169 crosses than in the XN4 x MX169 cross. The LB x XN4 and XN4 x SP crosses showed moderate narrow-sense heritability."

"17220363","abstracttext","The completion of the rice (Oryza sativa) genome draft has brought unprecedented opportunities for genomic studies of the world's most important food crop. Previous rice gene annotations have relied mainly on ab initio methods, which usually yield a high rate of false-positive predictions and give only limited information regarding alternative splicing in rice genes. Comparative approaches based on expressed sequence tags (ESTs) can compensate for the drawbacks of ab initio methods because they can simultaneously identify experimental data-supported genes and alternatively spliced transcripts. Furthermore, cross-species EST information can be used to not only offset the insufficiency of same-species ESTs but also derive evolutionary implications. In this study, we used ESTs from seven plant species, rice, wheat (Triticum aestivum), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), soybean (Glycine max), and Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), to annotate the rice genome. We developed a plant genome annotation pipeline, Plant Gene and Alternatively Spliced Variant Annotator (PGAA). Using this approach, we identified 852 genes (931 isoforms) not annotated in other widely used databases (i.e. the Institute for Genomic Research, National Center for Biotechnology Information, and Rice Annotation Project) and found 87% of them supported by both rice and nonrice EST evidence. PGAA also identified more than 44,000 alternatively spliced events, of which approximately 20% are not observed in the other three annotations. These novel annotations represent rich opportunities for rice genome research, because the functions of most of our annotated genes are currently unknown. Also, in the PGAA annotation, the isoforms with non-rice-EST-supported exons are significantly enriched in transporter activity but significantly underrepresented in transcription regulator activity. We have also identified potential lineage-specific and conserved isoforms, which are important markers in evolutionary studies. The data and the Web-based interface, RiceViewer, are available for public access at http://RiceViewer.genomics.sinica.edu.tw/."

"18504349","abstracttext","A significant fraction of the nuclear DNA of all eukaryotes is occupied by simple sequence repeats (SSRs) or microsatellites. This type of sequence has sparked great interest as a means of studying genetic variation, linkage mapping, gene tagging and evolution. Although SSRs at different positions in a gene help determine the regulation of expression and the function of the protein produced, little attention has been paid to the chromosomal organisation and distribution of these sequences, even in model species. This review discusses the main achievements in the characterisation of long-range SSR organisation in the chromosomes of Triticum aestivum L., Secale cereale L., and Hordeum vulgare L. (all members of Triticeae). We have detected SSRs using an improved FISH technique based on the random primer labelling of synthetic oligonucleotides (15-24 bases) in multi-colour experiments. Detailed information on the presence and distribution of AC, AG and all the possible classes of trinucleotide repeats has been acquired. These data have revealed the motif-dependent and non-random chromosome distributions of SSRs in the different genomes, and allowed the correlation of particular SSRs with chromosome areas characterised by specific features (e.g., heterochromatin, euchromatin and centromeres) in all three species. The present review provides a detailed comparative study of the distribution of these SSRs in each of the seven chromosomes of the genomes A, B and D of wheat, H of barley and R of rye.

"20219830","articletitle","Influence of sulfur deficiency on the expression of specific sulfate transporters and the distribution of sulfur, selenium, and molybdenum in wheat."
"20219830","abstracttext","Interactions between sulfur (S) nutritional status and sulfate transporter expression in field-grown wheat (Triticum aestivum) were investigated using Broadbalk +S and -S treatments (S fertilizer withheld) at Rothamsted, United Kingdom. In 2008, S, sulfate, selenium (Se), and molybdenum (Mo) concentrations and sulfate transporter gene expression were analyzed throughout development. Total S concentrations were lower in all tissues of -S plants, principally as a result of decreased sulfate pools. S, Se, and Mo concentrations increased in vegetative tissues until anthesis, and thereafter, with the exception of Mo, decreased until maturity. At maturity, most of the S and Se were localized in the grain, indicating efficient remobilization from vegetative tissues, whereas less Mo was remobilized. At maturity, Se and Mo were enhanced 7- and 3.7-fold, respectively, in -S compared with +S grain, while grain total S was not significantly reduced. Enhanced expression of sulfate transporters, for example Sultr1;1 and Sultr4;1, in -S plants explains the much increased accumulation of Se and Mo (7- and 3.7-fold compared with +S in grain, respectively). Sultr5;2 (mot1), thought to be involved in Mo accumulation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), did not fully explain patterns of Mo distribution; it was expressed in all tissues, decreasing in leaf and increasing in roots under -S conditions, and was expressed in florets at anthesis but not in grain at any other time. In conclusion, S fertilizer application has a marked impact on Mo and Se distribution and accumulation, which is at least partially a result of altered gene expression of the sulfate transporter family."
"22013218","articletitle","Molecular characterization of Rht-1 dwarfing genes in hexaploid wheat."
"22013218","abstracttext","The introduction of the Reduced height (Rht)-B1b and Rht-D1b semidwarfing genes led to impressive increases in wheat (Triticum aestivum) yields during the Green Revolution. The reduction in stem elongation in varieties containing these alleles is caused by a limited response to the phytohormone gibberellin (GA), resulting in improved resistance to stem lodging and yield benefits through an increase in grain number. Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 encode DELLA proteins, which act to repress GA-responsive growth, and their mutant alleles Rht-B1b and Rht-D1b are thought to confer dwarfism by producing more active forms of these growth repressors. While no semidwarfing alleles of Rht-A1 have been identified, we show that this gene is expressed at comparable levels to the other homeologs and represents a potential target for producing novel dwarfing alleles. In this study, we have characterized additional dwarfing mutations in Rht-B1 and Rht-D1. We show that the severe dwarfism conferred by Rht-B1c is caused by an intragenic insertion, which results in an in-frame 90-bp insertion in the transcript and a predicted 30-amino acid insertion within the highly conserved amino-terminal DELLA domain. In contrast, the extreme dwarfism of Rht-D1c is due to overexpression of the semidwarfing Rht-D1b allele, caused by an increase in gene copy number. We show also that the semidwarfing alleles Rht-B1d and Rht-B1e introduce premature stop codons within the amino-terminal coding region. Yeast two-hybrid assays indicate that these newly characterized mutations in Rht-B1 and Rht-D1 confer ""GA-insensitive"" dwarfism by producing DELLA proteins that do not bind the GA receptor GA INSENSITIVE DWARF1, potentially compromising their targeted degradation."

"19346441","abstracttext","Enhancement of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway in food crops benefits human health and adds commercial value of natural food colorants. However, predictable metabolic engineering or breeding is limited by the incomplete understanding of endogenous pathway regulation, including rate-controlling steps and timing of expression in carotenogenic tissues. The grass family (Poaceae) contains major crop staples, including maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), rice (Oryza sativa), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and millet (Pennisetum glaucum). Maize carotenogenesis was investigated using a novel approach to discover genes encoding limiting biosynthetic steps in the nutritionally targeted seed endosperm. A combination of bioinformatics and cloning were first used to identify and map gene families encoding enzymes in maize and other grasses. These enzymes represented upstream pathways for isopentenyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthesis and the downstream carotenoid biosynthetic pathway, including conversion to abscisic acid. A maize germplasm collection was used for statistical testing of the correlation between carotenoid content and candidate gene transcript levels. Multiple pathway bottlenecks for isoprenoid biosynthesis and carotenoid biosynthesis were discovered in specific temporal windows of endosperm development. Transcript levels of paralogs encoding isoprenoid isopentenyl diphosphate and geranylgeranyl diphosphate-producing enzymes, DXS3, DXR, HDR, and GGPPS1, were found to positively correlate with endosperm carotenoid content. For carotenoid pathway enzymes, transcript levels for CrtISO inversely correlated with seed carotenoid content, as compared with positive correlation of PSY1 transcripts. Since zeaxanthin epoxidase (ZEP) depletes the carotenoid pool in subsequent conversion to abscisic acid, ZEP transcripts were examined. Carotenoid accumulation was found to be inversely associated with ZEP1 and ZEP2 transcript levels. Extension of the maize results using phylogenetic analysis identified orthologs in other grass species that may serve as potential metabolic engineering targets."
"20688416","articletitle","The complex interactions between host immunity and non-biotrophic fungal pathogens of wheat leaves."
"20688416","abstracttext","Significant progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms used by plants to recognize pathogens and activate ""immune"" responses. A ""first line"" of defense can be triggered through recognition of conserved Pathogen or Microbe Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs), resulting in activation of basal (or non-host) plant defenses, referred to as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI). Disease resistance responses can also subsequently be triggered via gene-for-gene type interactions between pathogen avirulence effector genes and plant disease resistance genes (Avr-R), giving rise to effector triggered immunity (ETI). The majority of the conceptual advances in understanding these systems have been made using model systems, such as Arabidopsis, tobacco, or tomato in combination with biotrophic pathogens that colonize living plant tissues. In contrast, how these disease resistance mechanisms interact with non-biotrophic (hemibiotrophic or necrotrophic) fungal pathogens that thrive on dying host tissue during successful infection, is less clear. Several lines of recent evidence have begun to suggest that these organisms may actually exploit components of plant immunity in order to infect, successfully colonize and reproduce within host tissues. One underlying mechanism for this strategy has been proposed, which has been referred to as effector triggered susceptibility (ETS). This review aims to highlight the complexity of interactions between plant recognition and defense activation towards non-biotrophic pathogens, with particular emphasis on three important fungal diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves."

"21110112","abstracttext","Calcium is a ubiquitous and essential secondary messenger in eukaryotic signal transduction pathways. Calcium binding protein, as a component of pathways, plays various roles in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as in developmental processes in plants. In this study, a calcium binding protein gene, designated as TaCab1 (Triticum aestivum calcium binding EF-hand protein 1), was isolated and characterized from wheat leaves (cv. Suwon 11) infected by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici by in silico cloning and reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). TaCab1 did not have an intron and was predicted to encode a 216 amino acid protein which possesses an N-terminal region with a signal peptide, a transmembrane domain, an EF-hand motif and a caleosin domain. The results of transient assays with constructs of TaCab1 with green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene indicated that TaCab1 encodes a transmembrane protein. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses revealed that TaCab1 was highly expressed in leaves than roots and stems. Although up-regulated expression profiles of TaCab1 were quite similar in both incompatible and compatible interactions, its transcript accumulation in the compatible interaction was much higher than in the incompatible interaction. The transcription of TaCab1 was also up-regulated at different degrees after treated by phytohormones [abscisic acid, benzyl adenine, ethylene, methyl jasmonate and salicylic acid (SA)] and stress stimuli [wounding, low temperature, polyethylene glycol and high salinity]. These results suggest that TaCab1 is involved in the plant-pathogen recognition, symptom development, and the basal tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses through the SA signaling pathway."
"23355632","articletitle","MORE SPIKELETS1 is required for spikelet fate in the inflorescence of Brachypodium."
"23355632","abstracttext","Grasses produce florets on a structure called a spikelet, and variation in the number and arrangement of both branches and spikelets contributes to the great diversity of grass inflorescence architecture. In Brachypodium (Brachypodium distachyon), the inflorescence is an unbranched spike with a terminal spikelet and a limited number of lateral spikelets. Spikelets are indeterminate and give rise to a variable number of florets. Here, we provide a detailed description of the stages of inflorescence development in Brachypodium. To gain insight into the genetic regulation of Brachypodium inflorescence development, we generated fast neutron mutant populations and screened for phenotypic mutants. Among the mutants identified, the more spikelets1 (mos1) mutant had an increased number of axillary meristems produced from inflorescence meristem compared with the wild type. These axillary meristems developed as branches with production of higher order spikelets. Using a candidate gene approach, mos1 was found to have a genomic rearrangement disrupting the expression of an ethylene response factor class of APETALA2 transcription factor related to the spikelet meristem identity genes branched silkless1 (bd1) in maize (Zea mays) and FRIZZY PANICLE (FZP) in rice (Oryza sativa). We propose MOS1 likely corresponds to the Brachypodium bd1 and FZP ortholog and that the function of this gene in determining spikelet meristem fate is conserved with distantly related grass species. However, MOS1 also appears to be involved in the timing of initiation of the terminal spikelet. As such, MOS1 may regulate the transition to terminal spikelet development in other closely related and agriculturally important species, particularly wheat (Triticum aestivum)."

"24247703","abstracttext","Fertile r0 plants of the winter wheat line ND7532 (Triticum aestivum L.) were regenerated from callus tissue after 60-190 days in culture. Seeds produced from these self-pollinated plants were planted in the field. Of the 5586 R1 plants, 32 differed for one or more agronomic traits from plants not passed through tissue culture process. Gliadin electrophoregrams were prepared from bulk samples of R2 seed from these 32 plants. Four of the 32 produced gliadin patterns different from controls, so 12 seeds of each of these four lines were examined individually. Three of the four mutant lines were fixed for the presence of a mutant protein of 50 relative mobility units (RMU) and the corresponding loss of a parental protein of 26 RMU. The remaining line segregated for the presence/absence of band 50 and the corresponding loss/retention of band 26. The mutant protein of 50 RMU was never seen in control plants. This indicated that either band 50 was coded for by a mutant gene allelic to the gene that coded for band 26 or that bands 26 and 50 were coded for by two different structural alleles under the control of a common regulatory locus. Each of the 12 seeds from the four mutant lines contained a prominent protein band at 30 (RMU), which was only observed as a faint band in one control seed. The types of variation in gliadin patterns observed in somaclones of ND7532 were similar to those reported for the line 'Yaqui 50E', except that, gliadin changes occurred less frequently in ND7532."

"26239411","abstracttext_key message","A compensating, recombined Lr59 translocation with greatly reduced alien chromatin was identified. Microsatellite locus Xdupw217 occurs within the remaining segment and can be used as a co-dominant marker for Lr59. In earlier studies, leaf rust (caused by Puccinia triticina Eriks.) resistance gene Lr59 was transferred from Aegilops peregrina (Hackel) Maire et Weiler to chromosome arm 1AL of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The resistance gene was then genetically mapped on the translocated chromosome segment following homoeologous pairing induction. Eight recombinants that retained the least alien chromatin apparently resulted from crossover within a terminal region of the translocation that was structurally different from 1AL. These recombinants could not be differentiated by size, and it was not clear whether they were compensating in nature. The present study determined that the distal part of the original translocation has group 6 chromosome homoeology and a 6BS telomere (with the constitution of the full translocation chromosome being 1AS·1L(P)·6S(P) ·6BS). During the allosyndetic pairing induction experiment to map and shorten the full size translocation, a low frequency of quadrivalents involving 1A, the 1A translocation, and two 6B chromosomes was likely formed. Crossover within such quadrivalents apparently produced comparatively small compensating alien chromatin inserts within the 6BS satellite region on chromosome 6B of seven of the eight recombinants. It appears that the Gli-B2 storage protein locus on 6BS has not been affected by the recombination events, and the translocations are therefore not expected to affect baking quality. Simple sequence repeat marker results showed that Lr59-151 is the shortest recombinant, and it will therefore be used in breeding. Marker DUPW217 detects a homoeo-allele within the remaining alien chromatin that can be used for marker-assisted selection of Lr59."

"27156137","abstracttext","The expression profile chip of the wheat salt-tolerant mutant RH8706-49 was investigated under salt stress in our laboratory. Results revealed a novel gene induced by salt stress with unknown functions. The gene was named as TaZNF (Triticum aestivum predicted Dof zinc finger protein) because it contains the zf-Dof superfamily and was deposited in GenBank (accession no. KF307327). Further analysis showed that TaZNF significantly improved the salt-tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis. Various physiological indices of the transgenic plant were improved compared with those of the control after salt stress. Non-invasive micro-test (NMT) detection showed that the root tip of transgenic Arabidopsis significantly expressed Na(+) excretion. TaZNF is mainly localized in the nucleus and exhibited transcriptional activity. Hence, this protein was considered a transcription factor. The TaZNF upstream promoter was then cloned and was found to contain three salts, one jasmonic acid methyl ester (MeJA), and several ABA-responsive elements. The GUS staining and quantitative results of different tissues in the full-length promoter in the transgenic plants showed that the promoter was not tissue specific. The promoter activity in the root, leaf, and flower was enhanced after induction by salt stress. Moreover, GUS staining and quantitative measurement of GUS activity showed that the promoter sequence contained the positive regulatory element of salt and MeJA after their respective elements were mutated in the full-length promoter. RNA-Seq result showed that 2727 genes were differentially expressed; most of these genes were involved in the metabolic pathway and biosynthesis of secondary metabolite pathway."

"32300513","abstracttext","In this study, the Sr22 gene was isolated and prepared for transformation in disease-susceptible commercial high-yielding wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) cultivar Lasani-2008. The Sr22 fragment was initially inserted in plasmid pUC57 for sequence confirmation before performing further experiments. After confirmation, Sr22 was subcloned in pGreen0029 which helped in further cloning and ligation. pUC57- Sr22 was restricted with Nru 1 and Bam H1, while pGreen0029 was restricted with Eco RV and Bam H1 and ligated. From pGreen0029, Sr22 was eluted and ligated in pJIT163 to insert the 2 × 35S promoter and CaMV terminator using Xho 1 and Bam H1 and Sal 1. At this stage, the expression cassette was completed. The 2 × 35Sp- Sr22 -CaMVt was then ligated in pGreen0029 and transferred to Agrobacterium along with pSOUP. pSOUP helped pGreen0029 to insert 2X35Sp- Sr22 -CaMVt in the callus of Lasani-2008, along with kanamycin-resistant gene. Transgenic callus was used for regeneration of the whole plant by tissue culture. Transgenic plants were further tested by PCR, qPCR and SDS-PAGE. The transgenic Lasani-2008 showed substantial resistance against stem rust in both seedling and adult plant stages. The results also showed that transgenic Lasani-2008 has increased average yield of grains (i.e., 4893 ± 148 kg/ha) as compared to non-transgenic Lasani-2008 (i.e., with average yield of gains 4762 ± 103 kg/ha). Sr22 containing lines and the transgenic developed in this study can be used in breeding systems. Transgenic seeds developed will be shared with breeding institutes and breeders should use this information to develop new varieties."
"32480629","articletitle","Ozone triggers different defence mechanisms against powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis DC. Speer f. sp. tritici) in susceptible and resistant wheat genotypes."
"32480629","abstracttext","Ozone has been proposed as a convenient elicitor against pathogens since it is known to generate different reactive oxygen species (ROS) and induce nonspecific defence by altering gene expression. The mode of action and its interaction with other defence pathways are yet to be elucidated. Besides its negative effects on plants, ozone can be used for triggering defence against environmental stresses, including pathogens, when used at appropriate concentrations. Powdery mildew, caused by the obligate biotrophic fungus Blumera graminis f.sp. tritici (Bgt), is an important plant disease that reduces crop yield and quality. We hypothesised that ozone treatment may elicit defence against Bgt by inducing ROS signalling or other routes such as the salicylic acid (SA) or jasmonic acid (JA) pathways. We conducted experiments with Bgt-susceptible (cv. Pamukova) and resistant (cv. Tahirova) wheat (Triticum aestivum L,) cultivars and treated them with different ozone concentrations before Bgt inoculation. Stress response and defence-related features such as antioxidative enzyme activity; lipid peroxidation; H2O2 and Ca+2 levels; PR1, LOX, PAL and RBOH gene expression; and disease severity were assayed. Clear discrepancies between the responses of susceptible and resistant cultivars were found, suggesting that different defence routes were activated. Here, we showed that ozone treatment was effective for diminishing Bgt invasion in the susceptible cultivar in the short term, which was probably related to defence induced via the SA pathway. Moreover, the resistant cultivar Tahirova exhibited a different mode of action against the pathogen that was triggered by ozone treatment, plausibly related to the JA pathway."

Based on their morphological characteristics, biochemical features and molecular phylogenetic studies, these strains were concluded to belong to a new member of the genus Glycomyces. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain NEAU-A15 T shares 99.91% and 99.80% 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity with NEAU-A13 and NEAU-C4, respectively, and these three strains showed high sequence similarities to Glycomyces algeriensis DSM 44727 T (99.24, 99.45, 99.38%), Glycomyces lechevalierae DSM 44724 T (98.97, 99.17, 99.11%) and Glycomyces rutgersensis DSM 43812 T (98.83, 99.04, 98.97%). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that these three strains clustered together and formed a cluster with Glycomyces tritici NEAU-C2 T (97.30, 97.73, 99.48%), G. algeriensis DSM 44727 T , G. lechevalierae DSM 44724 T and G. rutgersensis DSM 43812 T . These three strains were observed to contain MK-10(H 2 ), MK-10(H 6 ) and MK-11 as menaquinones. The whole cell sugar profiles were found to contain galactose, ribose and xylose. The polar lipids were found to consist of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphoglycolipid, phosphatidylinositol mannoside and an unidentified glycolipid. The major fatty acids were identified as anteiso-C 15:0 , iso-C 16:0 , anteiso-C 17:0 and iso-C 15:0 . The DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain NEAU-A15 T and NEAU-A13/NEAU-C4 were 86.2 ± 2.3% and 83.4 ± 3.5%, respectively. The values between these three strains and their close phylogenetic relatives were 48-52%, supporting the conclusion that they belong to a distinct genomic species. An array of phenotypic characteristics also differentiated these isolates from their closely related species. On the basis of the genetic and phenotypic properties, strains NEAU-A15 T , NEAU-A13 and NEAU-C4 can be classified as representatives of a novel species of the genus Glycomyces, for which the name Glycomyces luteolus sp. nov., is proposed.

"30405674","abstracttext","As a major staple food, maize ( Zea mays ) is critical to food security. Shifting environmental pressures increasingly hamper crop defense capacities, causing expanded harvest loss. Specialized labdane-type diterpenoids are key components of maize chemical defense and ecological adaptation. Labdane diterpenoid biosynthesis most commonly requires the pairwise activity of class II and class I diterpene synthases (diTPSs) that convert the central precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate into distinct diterpenoid scaffolds. Two maize class II diTPSs, ANTHER EAR 1 and 2 (ZmAN1/2), have been previously identified as catalytically redundant ent -copalyl diphosphate (CPP) synthases. ZmAN1 is essential for gibberellin phytohormone biosynthesis, whereas ZmAN2 is stress-inducible and governs the formation of defensive kauralexin and dolabralexin diterpenoids. Here, we report the biochemical characterization of the two remaining class II diTPSs present in the maize genome, COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 3 (ZmCPS3) and COPALYL DIPHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 4 (ZmCPS4). Functional analysis via microbial co-expression assays identified ZmCPS3 as a (+)-CPP synthase, with functionally conserved orthologs occurring in wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) and numerous dicot species. ZmCPS4 formed the unusual prenyl diphosphate, 8,13-CPP (labda-8,13-dien-15-yl diphosphate), as verified by mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. As a minor product, ZmCPS4 also produced labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate (LPP). Root gene expression profiles did not indicate an inducible role of ZmCPS3 in maize stress responses. By contrast, ZmCPS4 showed a pattern of inducible gene expression in roots exposed to oxidative stress, supporting a possible role in abiotic stress responses. Identification of the catalytic activities of ZmCPS3 and ZmCPS4 clarifies the first committed reactions controlling the diversity of defensive diterpenoids in maize, and suggests the existence of additional yet undiscovered diterpenoid pathways."

"30813900","abstracttext_background","Leaves of Poaceae have a unique morphological feature: they consist of a proximal sheath and a distal blade separated by a ligular region. The sheath provides structural support and protects young developing leaves, whereas the main function of the blade is photosynthesis. The auricles allow the blade to tilt back for optimal photosynthesis and determine the angle of a leaf, whereas the ligule protects the stem from the entry of water, microorganisms, and pests. Liguleless variants have an upright leaf blade that wraps around the culm. Research on liguleless mutants of maize and other cereals has led to identification of genes that are involved in leaf patterning and differentiation."

The Lg t gene was mapped to chromosome 5DS. Taking into account coordinates of the SNP markers, flanking Lg t , on the pseudomolecule 5D, a chromosomal region that contains this gene was determined, and a list of candidate genes was identified.

Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics were consistent with those of members of the genus Agromyces . The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, glycolipid and three unidentified lipids.

"17426769","abstracttext","The aneuploid stocks of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum (Desf.) Husnot) and common wheat (T. aestivum L.) have been developed mainly in 'Langdon' (LDN) and 'Chinese Spring' (CS) cultivars, respectively. The LDN-CS D-genome chromosome disomic substitution (LDN-DS) lines, where a pair of CS D-genome chromosomes substitute for a corresponding homoeologous A- or B-genome chromosome pair of LDN, have been widely used to determine the chromosomal locations of genes in tetraploid wheat. The LDN-DS lines were originally developed by crossing CS nulli-tetrasomics with LDN, followed by 6 backcrosses with LDN. They have subsequently been improved with 5 additional backcrosses with LDN. The objectives of this study were to characterize a set of the 14 most recent LDN-DS lines and to develop chromosome-specific markers, using the newly developed TRAP (target region amplification polymorphism)-marker technique. A total of 307 polymorphic DNA fragments were amplified from LDN and CS, and 302 of them were assigned to individual chromosomes. Most of the markers (95.5%) were present on a single chromosome as chromosome-specific markers, but 4.5% of the markers mapped to 2 or more chromosomes. The number of markers per chromosome varied, from a low of 10 (chromosomes 1A and 6D) to a high of 24 (chromosome 3A). There was an average of 16.6, 16.6, and 15.9 markers per chromosome assigned to the A-, B-, and D-genome chromosomes, respectively, suggesting that TRAP markers were detected at a nearly equal frequency on the 3 genomes. A comparison of the source of the expressed sequence tags (ESTs), used to derive the fixed primers, with the chromosomal location of markers revealed that 15.5% of the TRAP markers were located on the same chromosomes as the ESTs used to generate the fixed primers. A fixed primer designed from an EST mapped on a chromosome or a homoeologous group amplified at least 1 fragment specific to that chromosome or group, suggesting that the fixed primers might generate markers from target regions. TRAP-marker analysis verified the retention of at least 13 pairs of A- or B-genome chromosomes from LDN and 1 pair of D-genome chromosomes from CS in each of the LDN-DS lines. The chromosome-specific markers developed in this study provide an identity for each of the chromosomes, and they will facilitate molecular and genetic characterization of the individual chromosomes, including genetic mapping and gene identification."

"29105256","abstracttext","Diseases caused by Fusarium pathogens inflict major yield and quality losses on many economically important plant species worldwide, including cereals. Fusarium crown rot (FCR), caused by Fusarium pseudograminearum, is a cereal disease that occurs in many arid and semi-arid cropping regions of the world. In recent years, this disease has become more prevalent, in part as a result of the adoption of moisture-preserving cultural practices, such as minimum tillage and stubble retention. In this pathogen profile, we present a brief overview of recent research efforts that have not only advanced our understanding of the interactions between F. pseudograminearum and cereal hosts, but have also provided new disease management options. For instance, significant progress has been made in the genetic characterization of pathogen populations, the development of new tools for disease prediction, and the identification and pyramiding of loci that confer quantitative resistance to FCR in wheat and barley. In addition, transcriptome analyses have revealed new insights into the processes involved in host defence. Significant progress has also been made in understanding the mechanistic details of the F. pseudograminearum infection process. The sequencing and comparative analyses of the F. pseudograminearum genome have revealed novel virulence factors, possibly acquired through horizontal gene transfer. In addition, a conserved pathogen gene cluster involved in the degradation of wheat defence compounds has been identified, and a role for the trichothecene toxin deoxynivalenol (DON) in pathogen virulence has been reported. Overall, a better understanding of cereal host-F. pseudograminearum interactions will lead to the development of new control options for this increasingly important disease problem. Taxonomy: Fusarium pseudograminearum O'Donnell & Aoki; Kingdom Fungi; Phylum Ascomycota; Subphylum Pezizomycotina; Class Sordariomycetes; Subclass Hypocreomycetidae; Order Hypocreales; Family Nectriaceae; Genus Fusarium. Disease symptoms: Fusarium crown rot caused by F. pseudograminearum is also known as crown rot, foot rot and root rot. Infected seedlings can die before or after emergence. If infected seedlings survive, typical disease symptoms are browning of the coleoptile, subcrown internode, lower leaf sheaths and adjacent stems and nodal tissues; this browning can become evident within a few weeks after planting or throughout plant development. Infected plants may develop white heads with no or shrivelled grains. Disease symptoms are exacerbated under water limitation. Identification and detection: Fusarium pseudograminearum macroconidia usually contain three to five septa (22-60.5 × 2.5-5.5 μm). On potato dextrose agar (PDA), aerial mycelia appear floccose and reddish white, with red or reddish-brown reverse pigmentation. Diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests based on the amplification of the gene encoding translation elongation factor-1a (TEF-1a) have been developed for molecular identification. Host range: All major winter cereals can be colonized by F. pseudograminearum. However, the main impact of this pathogen is on bread (Triticum aestivum L.) and durum (Triticum turgidum L. spp. durum (Dest.)) wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Oats (Avena sativa L.) can be infected, but show little or no disease symptoms. In addition, the pathogen has been isolated from various other grass genera, such as Phalaris, Agropyron and Bromus, which may occur as common weeds.

"23811222","articletitle","Identification of wheat gene Sr35 that confers resistance to Ug99 stem rust race group."
"23811222","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is a devastating disease that can cause severe yield losses. A previously uncharacterized Pgt race, designated Ug99, has overcome most of the widely used resistance genes and is threatening major wheat production areas. Here, we demonstrate that the Sr35 gene from Triticum monococcum is a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat gene that confers near immunity to Ug99 and related races. This gene is absent in the A-genome diploid donor and in polyploid wheat but is effective when transferred from T. monococcum to polyploid wheat. The cloning of Sr35 opens the door to the use of biotechnological approaches to control this devastating disease and to analyses of the molecular interactions that define the wheat-rust pathosystem."

"24414761","abstracttext","Analysis of a 10-parent diallel of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) grown at two diverse locations revealed that for enzyme lipoxidase activity, wheat and predicted macaroni pigment contents, heterosis was environmentally dependent. Both additive and dominance genetic effects were significant for each of these quality traits studied, but in one location, the additive genetic effect was consistently more pronounced than the dominance genetic effect, while the reverse was the case in the other location. There was no evidence of epistatic gene effect for any of the three characters in either location."

"28158253","abstracttext","Recently, we investigated the effect of the wheat 90K single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) array and three gene-specific (Ppd-D1, Vrn-A1 and Rht-B1) markers on quantitative trait loci (QTL) detection in a recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population derived from a cross between two spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars, 'Attila' and 'CDC Go', and evaluated for eight agronomic traits at three environments under organic management. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the effect of conventional management on QTL detection in the same mapping population using the same set of markers as the organic management and compare the results with organic management. Here, we evaluated 167 RILs for number of tillers (tillering), flowering time, maturity, plant height, test weight (grain volume weight), 1000 kernel weight, grain yield, and grain protein content at seven conventionally managed environments from 2008 to 2014. Using inclusive composite interval mapping (ICIM) on phenotypic data averaged across seven environments and a subset of 1203 informative markers (1200 SNPs and 3 gene specific markers), we identified a total of 14 QTLs associated with flowering time (1), maturity (2), plant height (1), grain yield (1), test weight (2), kernel weight (4), tillering (1) and grain protein content (2). Each QTL individually explained from 6.1 to 18.4% of the phenotypic variance. Overall, the QTLs associated with each trait explained from 9.7 to 35.4% of the phenotypic and from 22.1 to 90.8% of the genetic variance. Three chromosomal regions on chromosomes 2D (61-66 cM), 4B (80-82 cM) and 5A (296-297 cM) harbored clusters of QTLs associated with two to three traits. The coincidental region on chromosome 5A harbored QTL clusters for both flowering and maturity time, and mapped about 2 cM proximal to the Vrn-A1 gene, which was in high linkage disequilibrium (0.70 ≤ r2 ≤ 0.75) with SNP markers that mapped within the QTL confidence interval. Six of the 14 QTLs (one for flowering time and plant height each, and two for maturity and kernel weight each) were common between the conventional and organic management systems, which suggests issues in directly utilizing gene discovery results based on conventional management to make in detail selection (decision) for organic management."

"17248708","abstracttext","The glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) zymogram phenotypes of a series of 15 translocation lines, a chromosome addition line and a chromosome substitution line were determined. In each of the translocation lines a segment of the long arm of Triticum aestivum chromosome 3D has been replaced by a portion of an Agropyron elongatum homoeologue. Evidence was obtained that the products of the T. aestivum GOT-3 triplicate structural gene set randomly dimerize with the product of the homoeologous A. elongatum gene. Each translocation chromosome was found to carry either Got-D3 or Got-Ag3. By correlating the zymogram phenotype expressed by each translocation line with the observed frequency of meiotic pairing of each 3D/3Ag translocation chromosome with telocentric-3DL, it was shown that Got-D3 is located in the proximal portion of 3DL, slightly more than 4.3 crossover units from the centromere. The results of this genetic study confirm and extend earlier conclusions derived from cytogenetic studies as to the physical nature of the various 3D/3Ag chromosomes."

"9501141","abstracttext","Dichloroacetamide safeners protect maize (Zea mays L.) against injury from chloroacetanilide and thiocarbamate herbicides. Etiolated maize seedlings have a high-affinity cytosolic-binding site for the safener [3H](R,S)-3-dichloroacetyl-2,2,5-trimethyl-1, 3-oxazol-idine ([3H]Saf), and this safener-binding activity (SafBA) is competitively inhibited by the herbicides. The safener-binding protein (SafBP), purified to homogeneity, has a relative molecular weight of 39,000, as shown by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and an isoelectric point of 5.5. Antiserum raised against purified SafBP specifically recognizes a 39-kD protein in etiolated maize and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.), which have SafBA, but not in etiolated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), or Arabidopsis, which lack SafBA. SafBP is most abundant in the coleoptile and scarcest in the leaves, consistent with the distribution of SafBA. SBP1, a cDNA encoding SafBP, was cloned using polymerase chain reaction primers based on purified proteolytic peptides. Extracts of Escherichia coli cells expressing SBP1 have strong [3H]Saf binding, which, like binding to the native maize protein, is competitively inhibited by the safener dichlormid and the herbicides S-ethyl dipropylthiocarbamate, alachlor, and metolachlor. SBP1 is predicted to encode a phenolic O-methyltransferase, but SafBP does not O-methylate catechol or caffeic acid. The acquisition of its encoding gene opens experimental approaches for the evaluation of the role of SafBP in response to the relevant safeners and herbicides."
"13679977","articletitle","Identification and mapping of genetic loci affecting the free-threshing habit and spike compactness in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.)."
"13679977","abstracttext","Recombinant inbred lines of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) mapping population were used to localize genetic loci that affect traits related to the free-threshing habit (percent threshability, glume tenacity, and spike fragility) and to spike morphology (spike length, spikelet number, and spike compactness) of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). The ITMI population was planted in three environments during 1999 and 2000, and phenotypic and genotypic data were used for composite interval mapping. Two quantitative trait loci (QTL) that consistently affected threshability-associated traits were localized on chromosomes 2D and 5A. Coincident QTL on the short arm of 2D explained 44% of the variation in threshability, 17% of the variation in glume tenacity, and 42% of the variation in rachis fragility. QTL on chromosomes 2D probably represent the effect of Tg, a gene for tenacious glumes. Coincident QTL on the long arm of 5A explained 21% and 10% of the variation in glume tenacity and rachis fragility, respectively. QTL on 5A are believed to represent the effect of Q. Overall, free-threshing-related characteristics were predominantly affected by Tg and to a lesser extent by Q. Other QTL that were significantly associated with threshability-related traits in at least one environment were localized on chromosomes 2A, 2B, 6A, 6D, and 7B. Four QTL on chromosomes 1B, 4A, 6A, and 7A consistently affected spike characteristics. Coincident QTL on the short arm of chromosome 1B explained 18% and 7% of the variation in spike length and spike compactness, respectively. QTL on the long arm of 4A explained 11%, 14%, and 12% of the variation in spike length, spike compactness, and spikelet number, respectively. A QTL on the short arm of 6A explained 27% of the phenotypic variance for spike compactness, while a QTL on the long arm of 7A explained 18% of the variation in spikelet number. QTL on chromosomes 1B and 6A appear to affect spike dimensions by modulating rachis internode length, while QTL on chromosomes 4A and 7A do so by affecting the formation of spikelets. Other QTL that were significantly associated with spike morphology-related traits, in at least one environment, were localized on chromosomes 2B, 3A, 3D, 4D, and 5A."
"15533880","articletitle","Selective transcriptional down-regulation of anther invertases precedes the failure of pollen development in water-stressed wheat."
"15533880","abstracttext","Water deficit during male meiosis in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) causes pollen sterility. With a view to identifying the internal trigger for this failure, it was found that water stress specifically impairs the activities of vacuolar and cell-wall invertases in anthers prior to the arrest of pollen development. The enzymes are affected only when water deficit occurs around meiosis. Three invertase cDNAs, two encoding the cell-wall (Ivr1, Ivr3) and one the vacuolar (Ivr5) isoform, were isolated from an anther cDNA library. RNA gel-blot analysis using floral organs of well-watered plants revealed that these genes were expressed preferentially, though not exclusively, in anthers. Semi-quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that transitory water deficit during meiosis selectively down-regulated the transcription of two of the three genes, one encoding the vacuolar (Ivr5) and the other a cell-wall (Ivr1) isoform, without affecting the Ivr3 message. Their expression did not recover upon resumption of watering. Another homologue of Ivr1 was also down-regulated, but only during the post-stress period. The stress effects on invertase transcripts were consistent with those on the developmental profiles of the corresponding enzyme activities. In situ hybridization revealed that the stress-sensitive invertase genes, unlike an insensitive one, were expressed within the microspores. No evidence for an invertase inhibitor under stress was found. Together the results show that the decline in invertase activity is probably regulated primarily at the transcriptional level in a gene- and cell-specific manner."

"12481044","abstracttext","Gramene (http://www.gramene.org) is a comparative genome mapping database for grasses and a community resource for rice (Oryza sativa). It combines a semi-automatically generated database of cereal genomic and expressed sequence tag sequences, genetic maps, map relations, and publications, with a curated database of rice mutants (genes and alleles), molecular markers, and proteins. Gramene curators read and extract detailed information from published sources, summarize that information in a structured format, and establish links to related objects both inside and outside the database, providing seamless connections between independent sources of information. Genetic, physical, and sequence-based maps of rice serve as the fundamental organizing units and provide a common denominator for moving across species and genera within the grass family. Comparative maps of rice, maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), barley (Hordeum vulgare), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and oat (Avena sativa) are anchored by a set of curated correspondences. In addition to sequence-based mappings found in comparative maps and rice genome displays, Gramene makes extensive use of controlled vocabularies to describe specific biological attributes in ways that permit users to query those domains and make comparisons across taxonomic groups. Proteins are annotated for functional significance using gene ontology terms that have been adopted by numerous model species databases. Genetic variants including phenotypes are annotated using plant ontology terms common to all plants and trait ontology terms that are specific to rice. In this paper, we present a brief overview of the search tools available to the plant research community in Gramene."
"12750793","articletitle","Mapping QTLs for seed dormancy and the Vp1 homologue on chromosome 3A in wheat."
"12750793","abstracttext","A major component of the observed genetic variation for pre-harvest sprouting in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) appears to be the level of seed dormancy. Group 3 chromosomes have received attention as carrying the R genes for seed-coat color and the taVp1 genes that are orthologous to the maize Vp1 gene which encode a dormancy-related transcription factor. The objectives of the present study were to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for seed dormancy on chromosome 3A and to investigate an association between taVp1 or R-A1 and the QTLs detected. A mapping population in the form of recombinant inbred lines developed from the cross between the highly dormant Zenkoujikomugi (Zen) and Chinese Spring (CS) was utilized. Nineteen marker loci, including taVp1, were mapped on chromosome 3A. The taVp1 locus was located in the middle of the long arm, about 85 cM from the centromere. The population was evaluated in duplicate by growing them under controlled environment conditions. Two QTLs for seed dormancy, designated as QPhs.ocs-3A.1 and QPhs.ocs-3A.2, were identified on the short and long arms, respectively. QPhs.ocs-1 explained 23-38% of the phenotypic variation and the Zen allele had a striking effect on maintaining dormancy. QPhs.ocs-2, with a minor effect, was detectable only at the dormancy-breaking stage. Although QPhs.ocs-2 was loosely linked to taVp1 by around 50 cM, they are clearly distinct genes. Zen and CS carry the white R-A1a allele, and no QTL effect was detected in the vicinity region of R-A1. Hence it was concluded that the high dormancy associated with chromosome 3A of Zen is ascribable to QPhs.ocs-1 on the short arm but is not due to the direct contribution of either the taVp1 or R-A1 locus."

"15933881","abstracttext","To study the effect of gamma-ray treatment on donor and derived somatic hybrids, we carried out gamma-ray donor treatment experiments with a wide range of gamma-ray dosages and asymmetric somatic hybridization between protoplasts of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. Jinan 177) and protoplasts of Haynaldia villosa Schur. treated with different dosages of gamma-rays (40, 60 and 80 Gy, respectively). We first screened the putative hybrids by isozyme analysis, followed by characterization of nuclear and organellar genome composition of the hybrids. Genomic in situ hybridization on mitotic metaphases demonstrated that the donor chromosome elimination in the hybrids increased with increased gamma-ray dosage. Intergenomic chromosome recombination/translocations were observed in the hybrids from different dosages of gamma-rays. PCR amplification of 5S rDNA spacer sequences showed that only some of the regenerated hybrid clones inherited donor 5S rDNA sequences, suggesting that the donor DNA was also eliminated randomly. Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis using mitochondrion (mt) and chloroplast (cp) gene-specific probes showed that the hybrid calli contained mt genomes of both parents and the cp genome of only one of the parents. Recombinations between parental mt as well as cp genes were found in the hybrid clones. Furthermore, development of the hybrid clones was dependent on the gamma-ray dosage used for the donor treatment. Regenerated plants were only obtained from fusion combinations of low (40 Gy) and intermediate (60 Gy) dose irradiation. The possible role and significance of gamma-rays on the introgression of small segments of donor chromosomes to the receptor is discussed."
"15925408","articletitle","Effects of herbicide chlorimuron-ethyl on physiological mechanisms in wheat (Triticum aestivum)."
"15925408","abstracttext","Changes in the activity of antioxidant enzymes including peroxidases (POD) and superoxide dismutases (SOD) and in the contents of chlorophyll (CHL), malondialdehyde (MDA), and soluble proteins (SP) in wheat (Triticum aestivum) under the stress of chlorimuron-ethyl in soil were examined. Chlorimuron-ethyl induced oxidative stress that was indicated by elevated MDA content in leaves and roots after a 1-day exposure. The 300-microg/kg chlorimuron-ethyl treatment caused significant damage to CHL accumulation. The higher POD activity in roots than in leaves may be the result of the tissue-specific gene expression in the roots. Our data could suggest that the plant has the capacity to counteract the oxidative stress caused by 5-150 microg/kg chlorimuron-ethyl exposure at the first stage, but the capacity would be lost with exposure time. It is indicated that the increase of POD activity in the leaves may have been caused by H(2)O(2) produced from sources other than SOD. The damage to the antioxidative defensive systems in plants is affected by the concentration of chlorimuron-ethyl and exposure time, and the defensive effect of antioxidative enzymes is completely lost with prolonged exposure. When treated with 300 microg/kg of chlorimuron-ethyl, a significant decrease of SP content and SOD activity in the leaves and roots indicated that the decrease of SP content and the activity of SOD can be considered biomarkers of the serious stress of chlorimuron-ethyl in soil. The increase of SP content in leaves after 3-4 days of exposure to 5-150 microg/kg chlorimuron-ethyl suggests that the enhanced POD activity was due to true induction of de novo synthesis rather than reactivation of preexisting apoprotein. It can also be concluded that dose-response relationships exist only between the SP content in roots and leaves and the concentration of chlorimuron-ethyl."
"15168023","articletitle","Cold hardiness of wheat near-isogenic lines differing in vernalization alleles."
"15168023","abstracttext","Four major genes in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), with the dominant alleles designated Vrn-A1, Vrn-B1, Vrn-D1, and Vrn4, are known to have large effects on the vernalization response, but the effects on cold hardiness are ambiguous. Near-isogenic experimental lines (NILs) in a Triple Dirk (TD) genetic background with different vernalization alleles were evaluated for cold hardiness. Although TD is homozygous dominant for Vrn-A1 (formerly Vrn1) and Vrn-B1 (formerly Vrn2), four of the lines are each homozygous dominant for a different vernalization gene, and one line is homozygous recessive for all four vernalization genes. Following establishment, the plants were initially acclimated for 6 weeks in a growth chamber and then stressed in a low temperature freezer from which they were removed over a range of temperatures as the chamber temperature was lowered 1.3 degrees C h(-1). Temperatures resulting in no regrowth from 50% of the plants (LT(50)) were determined by estimating the inflection point of the sigmoidal response curve by nonlinear regression. The LT(50) values were -6.7 degrees C for cv. TD, -6.6 degrees C for the Vrn-A1 and Vrn4 lines, -8.1 degrees C for the Vrn-D1 (formerly Vrn3) line, -9.4 degrees C for the Vrn-B1 line, and -11.7 degrees C for the homozygous recessive winter line. The LT(50) of the true winter line was significantly lower than those of all the other lines. Significant differences were also observed between some, but not all, of the lines possessing dominant vernalization alleles. The presence of dominant vernalization alleles at one of the four loci studied significantly reduced cold hardiness following acclimation."
"15032859","articletitle","Influence of ozone on ribonuclease activity in wheat (Triticum aestivum) leaves."
"15032859","abstracttext","Ribonucleases (RNases) degrade RNA and exert a major influence on gene expression during development and in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. RNase activity typically increases in response to pathogen attack, wounding and phosphate (P(i)) deficiency. Activity also increases during senescence and other programmed cell death processes. The air pollutant ozone (O(3)) often induces injury and accelerated senescence in many plants, but the biochemical mechanisms involved in these responses remain unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether RNase activity and isozyme expression was stimulated in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) flag leaves following treatment with O(3). Plants were treated in open-top chambers with charcoal-filtered air (27 nmol O(3) mol(-1)) (control) or non-filtered air plus O(3) (90 nmol O(3) mol(-1)) (O(3)) from seedling to reproductive stage. After exposure for 56 days, RNase activity was 2.1 times higher in flag leaf tissues from an O(3)-sensitive cultivar in the O(3) treatment compared with the control, which generally coincided with foliar injury and lower soluble protein concentration, but not soluble leaf [P(i)]. Soluble [P(i)] in leaf tissue extracts from the O(3) and control treatments was not significantly different. RNase activity gels indicated the presence of three major RNases and two nucleases, and their expression was enhanced by the O(3) treatment. Isozymes stimulated in the O(3) treatment were also stimulated in naturally senescent flag leaf tissues from plants in the control. However, soluble [P(i)] in extracts from naturally senescent flag leaves was 50% lower than that found in green flag leaves in the control treatment. Thus, senescence-like pathological responses induced by O(3) were accompanied by increased RNase and nuclease activities that also were observed in naturally senescent leaves. However, [P(i)] in the leaf tissue samples suggested that O(3)-induced injury and accelerated senescence was atypical of normal senescence processes in that P(i) export was not observed in O(3)-treated plants."
"16133217","articletitle","Cereal phosphate transporters associated with the mycorrhizal pathway of phosphate uptake into roots."
"16133217","abstracttext","A very large number of plant species are capable of forming symbiotic associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi. The roots of these plants are potentially capable of absorbing P from the soil solution both directly through root epidermis and root hairs, and via the AM fungal pathway that delivers P to the root cortex. A large number of phosphate (P) transporters have been identified in plants; tissue expression patterns and kinetic information supports the roles of some of these in the direct root uptake pathways. Recent work has identified additional P transporters in several unrelated species that are strongly induced, sometimes specifically, in AM roots. The primary aim of the work described in this paper was to determine how mycorrhizal colonisation by different species of AM fungi influenced the expression of members of the Pht1 gene families in the cereals Hordeum vulgare (barley), Triticum aestivum (wheat) and Zea mays (maize). RT-PCR and in-situ hybridisation, showed that the transporters HORvu;Pht1;8 (AY187023), TRIae;Pht1;myc (AJ830009) and ZEAma;Pht1;6 (AJ830010), had increased expression in roots colonised by the AM fungi Glomus intraradices,Glomus sp. WFVAM23 and Scutellospora calospora. These findings add to the increasing body of evidence indicating that plants that form AM associations with members of the Glomeromycota have evolved phosphate transporters that are either specifically or preferentially involved in scavenging phosphate from the apoplast between intracellular AM structures and root cortical cells. Operation of mycorrhiza-inducible P transporters in the AM P uptake pathway appears, at least partially, to replace uptake via different P transporters located in root epidermis and root hairs."

"16402188","abstracttext","Plant breeding data comprise unbalanced phenotypic data for inbreds with complex pedigrees. As traditional methods to map quantitative trait loci (QTL) cannot exploit plant breeding data, an alternative approach is QTL mapping via a mixed-model procedure. Our objective was to validate mixed-model QTL mapping for self-pollinated crops by detecting QTL for kernel hardness and dough strength from data in a bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding program. We studied 80 parental and 373 experimental inbreds genotyped for 65 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and three candidate loci. The methodology involved three steps: variance component estimation, single-marker analyses, and a final multiple-marker analysis with marker effects treated as fixed effects. Two QTLs for kernel hardness were detected on chromosomes 1A (close to candidate locus GluA3) and 5D (close to candidate locus Ha). Four QTLs were detected for dough strength on chromosomes 1A, 1B, 1D, and 5B. Candidate gene GluA1, which was associated with dough strength, was the only candidate locus found significant. Results were consistent with previously reported markers and QTLs associated with kernel hardness and dough strength. Unlike previous studies that have assumed QTL effects as random, the assumption of fixed marker effects identified the favorable marker alleles to select for. We conclude that the detection of previously mapped QTL validates the usefulness of mixed-model QTL mapping in the context of a plant-breeding program."

"16531489","abstracttext","Phytochelatins (PCs) are peptides that function in heavy-metal chelation and detoxification in plants and fungi. A recent study showed that PCs have the ability to undergo long-distance transport in a root-to-shoot direction in transgenic Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). To determine whether long-distance transport of PCs can occur in the opposite direction, from shoots to roots, the wheat (Triticum aestivum) PC synthase (TaPCS1) gene was expressed under the control of a shoot-specific promoter (CAB2) in an Arabidopsis PC-deficient mutant, cad1-3 (CAB2TaPCS1/cad1-3). Analyses demonstrated that TaPCS1 is expressed only in shoots and that CAB2TaPCS1/cad1-3 lines complement the cadmium (Cd) and arsenic metal sensitivity of cad1-3 shoots. CAB2TaPCS1/cad1-3 plants exhibited higher Cd accumulation in roots and lower Cd accumulation in shoots compared to wild type. Fluorescence HPLC coupled to mass spectrometry analyses directly detected PC2 in the roots of CAB2:TaPCS1/cad1-3 but not in cad1-3 controls, suggesting that PC2 is transported over long distances in the shoot-to-root direction. In addition, wild-type shoot tissues were grafted onto PC synthase cad1-3 atpcs2-1 double loss-of-function mutant root tissues. An Arabidopsis grafting technique for mature plants was modified to obtain an 84% success rate, significantly greater than a previous rate of approximately 11%. Fluorescence HPLC-mass spectrometry showed the presence of PC2, PC3, and PC4 in the root tissue of grafts between wild-type shoots and cad1-3 atpcs2-1 double-mutant roots, demonstrating that PCs are transported over long distances from shoots to roots in Arabidopsis."

The objective of this study was to understand the distribution, redundancy, and segregation distortion of DArT markers in comparison with AFLP and SSR markers. The map contains a total of 624 markers with 189 DArTs, 165 AFLPs and 270 SSRs, and spans 2595.5 cM. All 3 marker types showed significant (p < 0.01) segregation distortion, but it was higher for AFLPs (24.2%) and SSRs (22.6%) than for DArTs (13.8%). The overall segregation distortion was 20.4%. DArTs showed the highest frequency of clustering (27.0%) at < 0.5 cM intervals between consecutive markers, which is 3 and 15 times higher than SSRs (8.9%) and AFLPs (1.8%), respectively. This high proportion of clustering of DArT markers may be indicative of gene-rich regions and (or) the result of inclusion of redundant clones in the genomic representations, which was supported by the presence of very high correlation coefficients (r > 0.98) and multicollinearity among the clustered markers. The present study is the first to compare the utility of DArT with AFLP and SSR markers, and the present map has been successfully used to identify novel QTLs for resistance to Fusarium head blight and powdery mildew and for anther extrusion, leaf segment incubation, and latency."

In higher plants, GB is synthesized by a two-step oxidation of choline via an intermediate form of betaine aldehyde, and catalyzed by choline monooxygenase and betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH). In this study, numerous truncated and/or recombinant transcripts of two BADH homologs resulting from an unusual posttranscriptional processing were detected in rice (Oryza sativa) and other cereal crops, including maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and barley (Hordeum vulgare). The observed events took place at the 5' exonic region, and led to the insertion of exogenous gene sequences and a variety of deletions that resulted in the removal of translation initiation codon, loss of functional domain, and frame-shifts with premature termination by introducing stop codon. By contrast, the BADH transcripts from dicotyledonous species, such as spinach (Spinacia oleracea), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), had correctly processed mRNA. This suggests the differentiation of posttranscriptional processing in BADH genes potentially contributes to the variation of GB-synthesizing capacities among various plant species. In addition, comprehensive sequence analyses demonstrated that extensive sequence similarities (named as short, direct repeats) are of paired presence surrounding the junctions of both the deletion and/or insertion sites in the unusual BADH transcripts. The site selection for the deletion/insertion was altered in response to the stress conditions. This indicates that the sequence elements of short, direct repeats are probably required for the recognition of the deletion/insertion sites."
"17039377","articletitle","Transcriptional analysis between two wheat near-isogenic lines contrasting in aluminum tolerance under aluminum stress."
"17039377","abstracttext","To understand the mechanisms of aluminum (Al) tolerance in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) libraries were constructed from Al-stressed roots of two near-isogenic lines (NILs). A total of 1,065 putative genes from the SSH libraries was printed in a cDNA array. Relative expression levels of those genes were compared between two NILs at seven time points of Al stress from 15 min to 7 days. Fifty-seven genes were differentially expressed for at least one time point of Al treatment. Among them, 28 genes including genes for aluminum-activated malate transporter-1, ent-kaurenoic acid oxidase-1, beta-glucosidase, lectin, histidine kinase, and phospoenolpyruvate carboxylase showed more abundant transcripts in Chisholm-T and therefore may facilitate Al tolerance. In addition, a set of genes related to senescence and starvation of nitrogen, iron, and sulfur, such as copper chaperone homolog, nitrogen regulatory gene-2, yellow stripe-1, and methylthioribose kinase, was highly expressed in Chisholm-S under Al stress. The results suggest that Al tolerance may be co-regulated by multiple genes with diverse functions, and those genes abundantly expressed in Chisholm-T may play important roles in enhancing Al tolerance. The down-regulated genes in Chisholm-S may repress root growth and restrict uptake of essential nutrient elements, and lead to root senescence."

"17478637","abstracttext","The effector protein NIP1 from the barley (Hordeum vulgare) pathogen Rhynchosporium secalis specifically induces the synthesis of defense-related proteins in cultivars of barley expressing the complementary resistance gene, Rrs1. In addition, it stimulates the activity of the barley plasma membrane H(+)-ATPase in a genotype-unspecific manner and it induces necrotic lesions in leaf tissues of barley and other cereal plant species. NIP1 variants type I and II, which display quantitative differences in their activities as elicitor and H(+)-ATPase stimulator, and the inactive mutant variants type III* and type IV*, were produced in Escherichia coli. Binding studies using (125)I-NIP1 type I revealed a single class of binding sites with identical binding characteristics in microsomes from near-isogenic resistant (Rrs1) and susceptible (rrs1) barley. Binding was specific, reversible, and saturable, and saturation ligand-binding experiments yielded a K(d) of 5.6 nm. A binding site was also found in rye (Secale cereale) and the nonhost species wheat (Triticum aestivum), oat (Avena sativa), and maize (Zea mays), but not in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). For NIP1 types I and II, equilibrium competition-binding experiments revealed a correlation between the difference in their affinities to the binding site and the differences in their elicitor activity and H(+)-ATPase stimulation, indicating a single target molecule to mediate both activities. In contrast, the inactive proteins type III* and type IV* are both characterized by high affinities similar to type I, suggesting that binding of NIP1 to this target is not sufficient for its activities."

"17909743","abstracttext","During the domestication of bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), evolutionary modifications that took place in seed dispersal mechanisms enhanced its suitability for agricultural production. One of these modifications involved the evolution of the free-threshing or hulless characteristic. In this study, we studied quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting components of the free-threshing habit (threshability and glume tenacity) on chromosome 2D in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population developed by the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) as well as the tenacious glumes 1 (Tg1) gene in F(2) progeny (CS/CS2D F(2)) of a cross between Chinese Spring and the 2D2 substitution line [Chinese Spring (Ae. tauschii 2D)]. In the ITMI population, two QTL affected threshability (QFt.orst-2D.1 and QFt.orst-2D.2) and their location coincided with QTL affecting glume tenacity (QGt.orst-2D.1 and QGt.orst-2D.2). In the CS/CS2D F(2) population, the location of QTL that affected glume tenacity (QGt.orst-2D.1), the size of a glume base scar after detachment (QGba.orst-2D), and Tg1 (12-cM interval between Xwmc112 and Xbarc168) also coincided. Map comparisons suggest that QFt-orst-2D.1, QGt.orst-2D.1, and QGba.orst-2D correspond to Tg1 whereas QFt.orst-2D.2 and QGt.orst-2D.2 appear to represent separate loci. The observation of coincident QTL for threshability and glume tenacity suggests that threshability is a function of glume adherence. In addition, the observation of the coincident locations of Tg1 and QTL for the force required to detach a glume and the size of a glume base scar after detachment suggests that Tg1's effect on both glume tenacity and threshability resides on its ability to alter the level of physical attachment of glumes to the rachilla of a spikelet."

"17646964","abstracttext","This study was conducted to identify microsatellite markers (SSR) linked to the adult-plant leaf rust resistance gene Lr22a and examine their cross-applicability for marker-assisted selection in different genetic backgrounds. Lr22a was previously introgressed from Aegilops tauschii Coss. to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and located to chromosome 2DS. Comparing SSR alleles from the donor of Lr22a to two backcross lines and their recurrent parents showed that between two and five SSR markers were co-introgressed with Lr22a and the size range of the Ae. tauschii introgression was 9-20 cM. An F(2) population from the cross of 98B34-T4B x 98B26-N1C01 confirmed linkage between the introgressed markers and Lr22a on chromosome 2DS. The closest marker, GWM296, was 2.9 cM from Lr22a. One hundred and eighteen cultivars and breeding lines of different geographical origins were tested with GWM296. In total 14 alleles were amplified, however, only those lines predicted or known to carry Lr22a had the unique Ae. tauschii allele at GWM296 with fragments of 121 and 131 bp. Thus, GWM296 is useful for selecting Lr22a in diverse genetic backgrounds. Genotypes carrying Lr22a showed strong resistance to leaf rust in the field from 2002 to 2006. Lr22a is an ideal candidate to be included in a stack of leaf rust resistance genes because of its strong adult-plant resistance, low frequency of commercial deployment, and the availability of a unique marker."

"21815980","abstracttext","Cold acclimation is necessary for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to achieve its genetically determined maximum freezing tolerance, and cold also fulfils the vernalisation requirement. Chromosome 5A is a major regulator of these traits. The aim of the present study was to discover whether changes in the half-cell redox potential of the glutathione/glutathione disulphide (GSH/GSSG) and ascorbate/dehydroascorbate (AA/DHA) couples induced by cold acclimation are related to freezing tolerance and vernalisation requirement in a specific genetic system including chromosome 5A substitution lines. The amounts of H₂O₂ and AA, and the AA/DHA ratio showed a rapid and transient increase in the crown of all genotypes during the first week of acclimation, followed by a gradual increase during the subsequent 2 weeks. The amount of GSH and its ratio compared to GSSG quickly decreased during the first day, while later these parameters showed a continuous slow increase. The H₂O₂, AA and GSH concentrations, AA/DHA and GSH/GSSG ratios and the half-cell reduction potential of the GSH/GSSG couple were correlated with the level of freezing tolerance after 22 days at 2 °C; hence these parameters may have an important role in the acclimation process. In contrast to H₂O₂ and the non-enzymatic antioxidants, the lipid peroxide concentration and activity of the four antioxidant enzymes exhibited a transient increase during the first week, with no significant difference between genotypes. None of the parameters studied showed any relationship with the vegetative/generative transition state monitored as apex morphology and vernalisation gene expression."
"21606317","articletitle","Phosphate utilization efficiency correlates with expression of low-affinity phosphate transporters and noncoding RNA, IPS1, in barley."
"21606317","abstracttext","Genetic variation in phosphorus (P) efficiency exists among wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare) genotypes, but the underlying mechanisms for the variation remain elusive. High- and low-affinity phosphate (Pi) PHT1 transporters play an indispensable role in P acquisition and remobilization. However, little is known about genetic variation in PHT1 gene expression and association with P acquisition efficiency (PAE) and P utilization efficiency (PUE). Here, we present quantitative analyses of transcript levels of high- and low-affinity PHT1 Pi transporters in four barley genotypes differing in PAE. The results showed that there was no clear pattern in the expression of four paralogs of the high-affinity Pi transporter HvPHT1;1 among the four barley genotypes, but the expression of a low-affinity Pi transporter, HvPHT1;6, and its close homolog HvHPT1;3 was correlated with the genotypes differing in PUE. Interestingly, the expression of HvPHT1;6 and HvPHT1;3 was correlated with the expression of HvIPS1 (for P starvation inducible; noncoding RNA) but not with HvIPS2, suggesting that HvIPS1 plays a distinct role in the regulation of the low-affinity Pi transporters. In addition, high PUE was found to be associated with high root-shoot ratios in low-P conditions, indicating that high carbohydrate partitioning into roots occurs simultaneously with high PUE. However, high PUE accompanying high carbon partitioning into roots could result in low PAE. Therefore, the optimization of PUE through the modification of low-affinity Pi transporter expression may assist further improvement of PAE for low-input agriculture systems."

"22926030","abstracttext_key message","Overexpressing TaUb2 promoted stem growth and resulted in early flowering in transgenic tobacco plants. Ubiquitin are involved in the production, metabolism and proper function of gibberellin. The ubiquitin-26S proteasome system (UPS), in which ubiquitin (Ub) functions as a marker, is a post-translational regulatory system that plays a prominent role in various biological processes. To investigate the impact of different Ub levels on plant growth and development, transgenic tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants were engineered to express an Ub gene (TaUb2) from wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing TaUb2 demonstrated an accelerated growth rate at early stage and an early flowering phenotype in development. The preceding expression of MADS-box genes also corresponded to the accelerated developmental phenotypes of the transgenic tobacco plants compared to that of wild-type (WT). Total gibberellin (GA) and active GA contents in transgenic tobacco plants were higher than those in WT at the corresponding developmental stages, and some GA metabolism genes were upregulated. Treatment with GA(3) conferred a similarly accelerated grown rate in WT plants to that of transgenic tobacco plants, while growth was inhibited when transgenic tobacco plants were treated with a GA biosynthesis inhibitor. Thus, the results suggest that Ub are involved in the production, metabolism and proper function of GA, which is important in the regulation of plant growth and development."
"19357429","articletitle","The influence of vernalization and daylength on expression of flowering-time genes in the shoot apex and leaves of barley (Hordeum vulgare)."
"19357429","abstracttext","Responses to prolonged low-temperature treatment of imbibed seeds (vernalization) were examined in barley (Hordeum vulgare). These occurred in two phases: the perception of prolonged cold, which occurred gradually at low temperatures, and the acceleration of reproductive development, which occurred after vernalization. Expression of the VERNALIZATION1 gene (HvVRN1) increased gradually in germinating seedlings during vernalization, both at the shoot apex and in the developing leaves. This occurred in darkness, independently of VERNALIZATION2 (HvVRN2), consistent with the hypothesis that expression of HvVRN1 is induced by prolonged cold independently of daylength flowering-response pathways. After vernalization, expression of HvVRN1 was maintained in the shoot apex and leaves. This was associated with accelerated inflorescence initiation and with down-regulation of HvVRN2 in the leaves. The largest determinant of HvVRN1 expression levels in vernalized plants was the length of seed vernalization treatment. Daylength did not influence HvVRN1 expression levels in shoot apices and typically did not affect expression in leaves. In the leaves of plants that had experienced a saturating seed vernalization treatment, expression of HvVRN1 was higher in long days, however. HvFT1 was expressed in the leaves of these plants in long days, which might account for the elevated HvVRN1 expression. Long-day up-regulation of HvVRN1 was not required for inflorescence initiation, but might accelerate subsequent stages of inflorescence development. Similar responses to seed vernalization were also observed in wheat (Triticum aestivum). These data support the hypothesis that VRN1 is induced by cold during winter to promote spring flowering in vernalization-responsive cereals."

"19363090","abstracttext","Plants contain several genes encoding thioredoxins (Trxs), small proteins involved in the regulation of the activity of many enzymes through dithiol-disulfide exchange. In addition to chloroplastic and cytoplasmic Trx systems, plant mitochondria contain a reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent Trx reductase and a specific Trx o, and to date, there have been no reports of a gene encoding a plant nuclear Trx. We report here the presence in pea (Pisum sativum) mitochondria and nuclei of a Trx isoform (PsTrxo1) that seems to belong to the Trx o group, although it differs from this Trx type by its absence of introns in the genomic sequence. Western-blot analysis with isolated mitochondria and nuclei, immunogold labeling, and green fluorescent protein fusion constructs all indicated that PsTrxo1 is present in both cell compartments. Moreover, the identification by tandem mass spectrometry of the native mitochondrial Trx after gel filtration using the fast-protein liquid chromatography system of highly purified mitochondria and the in vitro uptake assay into isolated mitochondria also corroborated a mitochondrial location for this protein. The recombinant PsTrxo1 protein has been shown to be reduced more effectively by the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial Trx reductase Trr2 than by the wheat (Triticum aestivum) cytoplasmic reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent Trx reductase. PsTrxo1 was able to activate alternative oxidase, and it was shown to interact with a number of mitochondrial proteins, including peroxiredoxin and enzymes mainly involved in the photorespiratory process."

"19421778","abstracttext","In plants, the C-repeat binding factors (Cbfs) are believed to regulate low-temperature (LT) tolerance. However, most functional studies of Cbfs have focused on characterizing expression after an LT shock and have not quantified differences associated with variable temperature induction or the rate of response to LT treatment. In the Triticeae, rye (Secale cereale L.) is one of the most LT-tolerant species, and is an excellent model to study and compare Cbf LT induction and expression profiles. Here, we report the isolation of rye Cbf genes (ScCbfs) and compare their expression levels in spring- and winter-habit rye cultivars and their orthologs in two winter-habit wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) cultivars. Eleven ScCbfs were isolated spanning all four major phylogenetic groups. Nine of the ScCbfs mapped to 5RL and one to chromosome 2R. Cbf expression levels were variable, with stronger expression in winter- versus spring-habit rye cultivars but no clear relationship with cultivar differences in LT, down-stream cold-regulated gene expression and Cbf expression were detected. Some Cbfs were expressed only at warmer acclimation temperatures in all three species and their expression was repressed at the end of an 8-h dark period at warmer temperatures, which may reflect a temperature-dependent, light-regulated diurnal response. Our work indicates that Cbf expression is regulated by complex genotype by time by induction-temperature interactions, emphasizing that sample timing, induction-temperature and light-related factors must receive greater consideration in future studies involving functional characterization of LT-induced genes in cereals."
"21063735","articletitle","Early and late plastid development in response to chill stress and heat stress in wheat seedlings."
"21063735","abstracttext","Five-day-old etiolated wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings were transferred to 7°C (chill stress), 25°C (control), and 42°C (heat stress) and were kept in the dark or light for different time periods. Plastids were isolated from the control and stressed seedlings, and their low-temperature (77 K) fluorescence emission spectra were monitored. Most of the Protochlorophyllide (Pchlide) present in heat-stressed etiolated seedlings were in nonphototransformable form. The phototransformable Pchlide (F657) rapidly decreased when 5-day-old etiolated seedlings were transferred to 42°C in the dark for 24 h. A flash illumination of 0.2 s given to etiolated heat-stressed seedlings resulted in substantial arrest of Shibata shift, while in chill-stress conditions, it was only partially affected. In high temperature, due to disaggregation of polymeric Pchlide-Pchlide oxidoreductase (POR)-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) molecules, the conversion of nonphototransformable Pchlide to its phototransformable form is substantially delayed resulting in impaired Shibata shift and belated development of the core antenna CP47 Photosystem II (PSII). Chill stress, however, did not disaggregate the polymeric Pchlide-POR-NADPH molecule-suppressed Pchlide and Chl synthesis and impaired of the assembly of PSII core antenna CP47 that emits F695 and PSI that emits F735. The decreased gene/protein expression and reduced posttranslational import of plastidic proteins, importantly POR in temperature-stressed plants, may be responsible for the delay in conversion of nonphototransformable to phototransformable form of Pchlide and plastid biogenesis."
"22279145","articletitle","Identification of high-temperature-responsive genes in cereals."
"22279145","abstracttext","High temperature influences plant development and can reduce crop yields. We examined how ambient temperature influences reproductive development in the temperate cereals wheat (Triticum aestivum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). High temperature resulted in rapid progression through reproductive development in long days, but inhibited early stages of reproductive development in short days. Activation of the long-day flowering response pathway through day-length-insensitive alleles of the PHOTOPERIOD1 gene, which result in high FLOWERING LOCUS T-like1 transcript levels, did not allow rapid early reproductive development at high temperature in short days. Furthermore, high temperature did not increase transcript levels of FLOWERING LOCUS T-like genes. These data suggest that genes or pathways other than the long-day response pathway mediate developmental responses to high temperature in cereals. Transcriptome analyses suggested a possible role for vernalization-responsive genes in the developmental response to high temperature. The MADS-box floral repressor HvODDSOC2 is expressed at elevated levels at high temperature in short days, and might contribute to the inhibition of early reproductive development under these conditions. FLOWERING PROMOTING FACTOR1-like, RNase-S-like genes, and VER2-like genes were also identified as candidates for high-temperature-responsive developmental regulators. Overall, these data suggest that rising temperatures might elicit different developmental responses in cereal crops at different latitudes or times of year, due to the interaction between temperature and day length. Additionally, we suggest that different developmental regulators might mediate the response to high temperature in cereals compared to Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana)."

"22329159","abstracttext","Bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) germplasm consisting of 45 genotypes were clustered phenotypically using ten morphological traits and Area Under Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) as measure of stripe rust resistance. The clustering was ratified by using twenty three molecular markers (SSR, EST and STS) linked to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici) resistant QTLs. The aim was to asses the extent of genetic variability among the genotypes in order to select the parents for crossing between the resistant and susceptible genotypes with respect to stripe rust. The Euclidian dissimilarity values resulted from phenotypic data regarding morphological traits and AUDPC were used to construct a dendrogram for clustering the accessions. Using un-weighted pair group method with arithmetic means, another dendrogram resulted from the similarity coefficient values was used to distinguish the genotypes with respect to stripe rust. Clustering based on phenotypic data produced two major groups and five clusters (with Euclidian dissimilarity ranging from 244 to 16.16) whereas genotypic data yielded two major groups and four clusters (with percent similarity coefficient values ranging from 0.1 to 46.0) to separate the gene pool into highly resistant, resistant, moderately resistant, moderately susceptible and susceptible genotypes. With few exceptions, the outcome of both type of clustering was almost similar and resistant as well as susceptible genotypes came in the same clusters of molecular genotyping as yielded by phenotypic clustering. As a result seven genotypes (Bakhtawar-92, Frontana, Saleem 2000, Tatara, Inqilab-91, Fakhre Sarhad and Karwan) of diverse genetic background were selected for pyramiding stripe rust resistant genes as well as some other agronomic traits after hybridization."

Previous studies have identified 21, 27, and 34 FLAs in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa), and wheat (Triticum aestivum), respectively. In this study, we identified 33 FLAs in the annotated genome of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis line Chiifu-401-42). Sequence analysis indicated that FAS domains each contain two highly conserved regions, named H1 and H2, and that 17 FLAs from B. rapa (BrFLAs) possess both of these regions. Prediction of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification sites suggested that 15 BrFLAs were GPI-anchored to the plasma membrane. Additionally, 25 BrFLAs may have been duplicated during the processes that shaped the triplicated genome of the mesopolyploid B. rapa. Expression analyses indicated that BrFLA1, BrFLA11, BrFLA13, BrFLA28 and BrFLA32 were specifically expressed in inflorescence. Meanwhile, BrFLA9 (homologous to AtFLA12) is specifically expressed in stem, and BrFLA6/22 (homologous to AtFLA11) is also highly expressed in stem, suggesting BrFLA6/9/22 may have the same functions as AtFLA11/12 in A. thaliana. Taken together, the identification and bioinformatic analysis of FLAs in B. rapa will open the way for studying their biological functions in plant growth and development as well as evolutionary history of this gene family from A. thaliana to B. rapa."

"23204428","abstracttext","The TaMATE1B gene (for multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) from wheat (Triticum aestivum) was isolated and shown to encode a citrate transporter that is located on the plasma membrane. TaMATE1B expression in roots was induced by iron deficiency but not by phosphorus deficiency or aluminum treatment. The coding region of TaMATE1B was identical in a genotype showing citrate efflux from root apices (cv Carazinho) to one that lacked citrate efflux (cv Egret). However, sequence upstream of the coding region differed between these two genotypes in two ways. The first difference was a single-nucleotide polymorphism located approximately 2 kb upstream from the start codon in cv Egret. The second difference was an 11.1-kb transposon-like element located 25 bp upstream of the start codon in cv Carazinho that was absent from cv Egret. The influence of these polymorphisms on TaMATE1B expression was investigated using fusions to green fluorescent protein expressed in transgenic lines of rice (Oryza sativa). Fluorescence measurements in roots of rice indicated that 1.5- and 2.3-kb regions upstream of TaMATE1B in cv Carazinho (which incorporated 3' regions of the transposon-like element) generated 20-fold greater expression in the apical 1 mm of root compared with the native promoter in cv Egret. By contrast, fluorescence in more mature tissues was similar in both cultivars. The presence of the single-nucleotide polymorphism alone consistently generated 2-fold greater fluorescence than the cv Egret promoter. We conclude that the transposon-like element in cv Carazinho extends TaMATE1B expression to the root apex, where it confers citrate efflux and enhanced aluminum tolerance."
"23737074","articletitle","The effect of day-neutral mutations in barley and wheat on the interaction between photoperiod and vernalization."
"23737074","abstracttext","Vernalization-2 (Vrn-2) is the major flowering repressor in temperate cereals. It is only expressed under long days in wild-type plants. We used two day-neutral (photoperiod insensitive) mutations that allow rapid flowering in short or long days to investigate the day length control of Vrn-2. The barley (Hordeum vulgare) early maturity8 (eam8) mutation affects the barley ELF3 gene. eam8 mutants disrupt the circadian clock resulting in elevated expression of Ppd-H1 and the floral activator HvFT1 under short or long days. When eam8 was crossed into a genetic background with a vernalization requirement Vrn-2 was expressed under all photoperiods and the early flowering phenotype was partially repressed in unvernalized (UV) plants, likely due to competition between the constitutively active photoperiod pathway and the repressing effect of Vrn-2. We also investigated the wheat (Triticum aestivum) Ppd-D1a mutation. This differs from eam8 in causing elevated levels of Ppd-1 and TaFT1 expression without affecting the circadian clock. We used genotypes that differed in ""short-day vernalization"". Short days were effective in promoting flowering in individuals wild type at Ppd-D1, but not in individuals that carry the Ppd-D1a mutation. The latter showed Vrn-2 expression in short days. In summary, eam8 and Ppd-D1a mimic long days in terms of photoperiod response, causing Vrn-2 to become aberrantly expressed (in short days). As Ppd-D1a does not affect the circadian clock, this also shows that clock regulation of Vrn-2 operates indirectly through one or more downstream genes, one of which may be Ppd-1."

"23934883","abstracttext","In genome-based prediction there is considerable uncertainty about the statistical model and method required to maximize prediction accuracy. For traits influenced by a small number of quantitative trait loci (QTL), predictions are expected to benefit from methods performing variable selection [e.g., BayesB or the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO)] compared to methods distributing effects across the genome [ridge regression best linear unbiased prediction (RR-BLUP)]. We investigate the assumptions underlying successful variable selection by combining computer simulations with large-scale experimental data sets from rice (Oryza sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and Arabidopsis thaliana (L.). We demonstrate that variable selection can be successful when the number of phenotyped individuals is much larger than the number of causal mutations contributing to the trait. We show that the sample size required for efficient variable selection increases dramatically with decreasing trait heritabilities and increasing extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD). We contrast and discuss contradictory results from simulation and experimental studies with respect to superiority of variable selection methods over RR-BLUP. Our results demonstrate that due to long-range LD, medium heritabilities, and small sample sizes, superiority of variable selection methods cannot be expected in plant breeding populations even for traits like FRIGIDA gene expression in Arabidopsis and flowering time in rice, assumed to be influenced by a few major QTL. We extend our conclusions to the analysis of whole-genome sequence data and infer upper bounds for the number of causal mutations which can be identified by LASSO. Our results have major impact on the choice of statistical method needed to make credible inferences about genetic architecture and prediction accuracy of complex traits."

"24521485","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina, is the most common and widespread disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum) worldwide. Deployment of host-plant resistance is one of the strategies to reduce losses due to leaf rust disease. The objective of this study was to map genes for adult-plant resistance to leaf rust in a recombinant inbred line (RIL) population originating from MN98550-5/MN99394-1. The mapping population of 139 RILs and five checks were evaluated in 2005, 2009, and 2010 in five environments. Natural infection occurred in the 2005 trials and trials in 2009 and 2010 were inoculated with leaf rust. Four quantitative trait loci (QTL) on chromosomes 2BS, 2DS, 7AL, and 7DS were detected. The QTL on 2BS explained up to 33.6% of the phenotypic variation in leaf rust response, whereas the QTL on 2DS, 7AL, and 7DS explained up to 15.7, 8.1, and 34.2%, respectively. Seedling infection type tests conducted with P. triticina races BBBD and SBDG confirmed that the QTL on 2BS and 2DS were Lr16 and Lr2a, respectively, and these genes were expressed in the seedling and field plot tests. The Lr2a gene mapped at the same location as Sr6. The QTL on 7DS was Lr34. The QTL on 7AL is a new QTL for leaf rust resistance. The joint effects of all four QTL explained 74% of the total phenotypic variation in leaf rust severity. Analysis of different combinations of QTL showed that the RILs containing all four or three of the QTL had the lowest average leaf rust severity in all five environments. Deployment of these QTL in combination or with other effective genes will lead to successful control of leaf rust."

"24309759","abstracttext","The three major isoenzymes of the NADP-dependent aromatic alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH-B), distinguished in polyploid wheats by means of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, are shown to be coded by homoeoalleles of the locus Adh-2 on short arms of chromosomes of the fifth homoeologous group. Essentially codominant expression of the Adh-2 homoeolleles of composite genomes was observed in young seedlings of hexaploid wheats (T. aestivum s.l.) and tetraploid wheats of the emmer group (T. turgidum s.l.), whereas only the isoenzyme characteristic of the A genome is present in the seedlings of the timopheevii-group tetraploids (T. timopheevii s.str. and T. araraticum).The slowest-moving B(3) isoenzyme of polyploid wheats, coded by the homoeoallele of the B genome, is characteristic of the diploid species Aegilops speltoides S.l., including both its awned and awnless forms, but was not encountered in Ae. bicornis, Ae. sharonensis and Ae. longissima. The last two diploids, as well as Ae. tauschii, Ae. caudata, Triticum monococcum s.str., T. boeoticum s.l. (incl. T. thaoudar) and T. urartu all shared a common isoenzyme coinciding electrophoretically with the band B(2) controlled by the A and D genome homoeoalleles in polyploid wheats. Ae. bicomis is characterized by the slowest isoenzyme, B(4), not found in wheats and in the other diploid Aegilops species studied.Two electrophoretic variants of ADH-B, B(1) and B(2), considered to be alloenzymes of the A genome homoeoallele, were observed in T. dicoccoides, T. dicoccon, T. turgidum. s.str. and T. spelta, whereas B(2) was characteristic of T. timopheevii s.l. and only B(1) was found in the remaining taxa of polyploid wheats. The isoenzyme B(1), not encountered among diploid species, is considered to be a mutational derivative which arose on the tetraploid level from its more ancestral form B(2) characteristic of diploid wheats.The implication of the ADH-B isoenzyme data to the problems of wheat phylogeny and gene evolution is discussed."

"24253843","abstracttext","Growth parameters were determined for tall (rht3) and dwarf (Rht3) seedlings of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Plant statures and leaf length were reduced by 50% in dwarfs but root and shoot dry weights were less affected. Leaves of dwarf seedlings had shorter epidermal cells and the numbers of cells per rank in talls and dwarfs matched the observed relationships in overall length. Talls grew at twice the rate of dwarfs (2.3 compared with 1.2 mm h(-1)). [(3)H]Gibberellin A1 ([(3)H]GA1) was fed to seedlings via the third leaf and metabolism was followed over 12 h. Immature leaves of tall seedlings transferred radioactivity rapidly to compounds co-chromatographing with [(3)H]gibberellin A8 ([(3)H]GA8) and a conjugate of [(3)H]GA8, whereas leaves of dwarf seedlings metabolised [(3)H]GA1 more slowly. Roots of both genotypes produced [(3)H]GA8-like material at similar rates. Isotopic dilution studies indicated a reduced 2β-hydroxylation capacity in dwarfs, but parallel estimates of the endogenous GA pool size, obtained by radioimmunoassay, indicated a 12-15 times higher level of GA in the dwarf immature leaves. Dwarfing by the Rht3 gene does not appear to operate through enhanced, or abnormal metabolism of active gibberellins and the act of GA metabolism does not bear an obligate relationship to the growth response."
"25100008","articletitle","Mitochondrial energy-dissipating systems (alternative oxidase, uncoupling proteins, and external NADH dehydrogenase) are involved in development of frost-resistance of winter wheat seedlings."
"25100008","abstracttext","Gene expression, protein synthesis, and activities of alternative oxidase (AOX), uncoupling proteins (UCP), adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT), and non-coupled NAD(P)H dehydrogenases (NDex, NDPex, and NDin) were studied in shoots of etiolated winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seedlings after exposure to hardening low positive (2°C for 7 days) and freezing (-2°C for 2 days) temperatures. The cold hardening efficiently increased frost-resistance of the seedlings and decreased the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during further cold shock. Functioning of mitochondrial energy-dissipating systems can represent a mechanism responsible for the decrease in ROS under these conditions. These systems are different in their response to the action of the hardening low positive and freezing temperatures. The functioning of the first system causes induction of AOX and UCP synthesis associated with an increase in electron transfer via AOX in the mitochondrial respiratory chain and also with an increase in the sensitivity of mitochondrial non-phosphorylating respiration to linoleic and palmitic acids. The increase in electron transfer via AOX upon exposure of seedlings to hardening freezing temperature is associated with retention of a high activity of NDex. It seems that NDex but not the NDPex and NDin can play an important role in maintaining the functional state of mitochondria in heterotrophic tissues of plants under the influence of freezing temperatures. The involvement of the mitochondrial energy-dissipating systems and their possible physiological role in the adaptation of winter crops to cold and frost are discussed."

"26109252","abstracttext","The large subunit of ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), the rate limiting enzyme in starch biosynthesis in Triticum aestivum L., is encoded by the ADP glucose pyrophosphorylase large subunit (AGP-L) gene. This was the first report on the development of three genome-specific primer sets for isolating the complete genomic sequence of all three homoeologous AGP-L genes on group 1 chromosomes. All three AGP-L genes consisted of 15 introns and 15 exons. The lengths of the structural genes from start to stop codon were 3334 bp for AGP-L-A1, 3351 bp for AGP-L-B1, and 3340 bp for AGP-L-D1. The coding region was 1569 bases long in all three genomes. All three AGP-L genes encoded 522 amino acid residues including the transit peptide sequences with 62 amino acid residues and the mature protein with 460 amino acid residues. The mature protein of three AGP-L genes was highly conserved. Three AGP-L genes were sequenced in 47 diverse spring and winter wheat genotypes. One and two haplotypes were found for AGP-L-D1 and AGP-L-A1, respectively. In total, 67 SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) and 13 indels (insertions or deletions) forming five haplotypes were identified for AGP-L-B1. All 13 indels and 58 of the 67 SNPs among the 47 genotypes were located in the non-coding regions, while the remaining nine SNPs were synonymous substitutions in the coding region. Significant LD was found among the 45 SNPs and ten indels located from intron 2 to intron 3. Association analysis indicated that four SNPs were strongly associated with seed number per spike and thousand kernel weight."

"26057533","abstracttext","Aquaporins (AQPs) are major intrinsic proteins (MIPs) that mediate bidirectional flux of water and other substrates across cell membranes, and play critical roles in plant-water relations, dehydration stress responses and crop productivity. However, limited data are available as yet on the contributions of these proteins to the physiology of the major crop barley (Hordeum vulgare). The present work reports the identification and expression analysis of the barley MIP family. A comprehensive search of publicly available leaf mRNA-seq data, draft barley genome data, GenBank transcripts and sixteen new annotations together revealed that the barley MIP family is comprised of at least forty AQPs. Alternative splicing events were likely in two plasma membrane intrinsic protein (PIP) AQPs. Analyses of the AQP signature sequences and specificity determining positions indicated a potential of several putative AQP isoforms to transport non-aqua substrates including physiological important substrates, and respond to abiotic stresses. Analysis of our publicly available leaf mRNA-seq data identified notable differential expression of HvPIP1;2 and HvTIP4;1 under salt stress. Analyses of other gene expression resources also confirmed isoform-specific responses in different tissues and/or in response to salinity, as well as some potentially inter-cultivar differences. The work reports systematic and comprehensive analysis of most, if not all, barley AQP genes, their sequences, expression patterns in different tissues, potential transport and stress response functions, and a strong framework for selection and/or development of stress tolerant barley varieties. In addition, the barley data would be highly valuable for genetic studies of the evolutionarily closely related wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."

"26020768","abstracttext","Brassinosteroids (BRs) are plant hormones, fundamental for the growth and development of plants. A trans-membrane protein receptor kinase, Brassinosteroid-Insensitive 1 (BRI1), is known to interact with BRs and be directly involved in plant development. This study investigates the structural organization of BRI1 orthologs in several taxa, with a specific interest in Triticum aestivum. True orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana BRI1 (AtBRI1) from seven-plant species showed sequence identity ranging from 54% to 95% at the protein level. All gene sequences lacked introns, leading to speculation that post-transcriptional processing in TaBRI1 is similar to AtBRI1. Based on in silico analysis, a single copy of BRI1 was present in each of the three wheat genomes on the long arm of chromosome 3. Domain structure of BRI1 orthologs among different taxa showed multiple leucine rich repeats (LRRs), an island domain (ID), a juxtamembrane/transmembrane domain (JTMD), a catalytic kinase domain (KD), C and N-Terminal domains. The KD showed the highest level of conservation while the LRRs and JTMD were most variable. Phosphorylation of residues in the juxtamembrane domain, known to be involved in the activation of the KD, is conserved in TaBRI1. While TaBRI1 has well-defined differences in the ID and LRR domains, many residues involved in ligand binding are conserved. The activation loop present in the KD showed 100% conservation in all taxa. Despite residue differences, hydrophobicity was conserved in the BR binding pocket across taxa, suggesting that function may not differ as drastically as residue identity may suggest. Predicted 3D structure of AtBRI1 and TaBRI1 showed a conserved super helical assembly, a feature essential in protein-protein interactions. An unrooted phylogram showed TaBRI1 in the monocot clade to be distinct from that of dicots. New insight in the structure and functions of BRI1 may help in targeting BR pathway for crop improvement."

"25881124","abstracttext_background","Identifying pathogen virulence genes required to cause disease is crucial to understand the mechanisms underlying the pathogenic process. Plasmid insertion mutagenesis of fungal protoplasts is frequently used for this purpose in filamentous ascomycetes. Post transformation, the mutant population is screened for loss of virulence to a specific plant or animal host. Identifying the insertion event has previously met with varying degrees of success, from a cleanly disrupted gene with minimal deletion of nucleotides at the insertion point to multiple-copy insertion events and large deletions of chromosomal regions. Currently, extensive mutant collections exist in laboratories globally where it was hitherto impossible to identify all the affected genes."

We developed the FindInsertSeq workflow to localise the DNA tag insertions to the nucleotide level. The workflow was tested using four mutants showing evidence of single and multi-copy insertions in DNA blot analysis. FindInsertSeq was able to identify both single and multi-copy concatenation insertion sites. By comparing sequencing coverage, unexpected molecular recombination events such as large tagged and untagged chromosomal deletions, and DNA amplification were observed in three of the analysed mutants. A random data sampling approach revealed the minimum genome coverage required to survey the F. graminearum genome for alterations."

"26455400","abstracttext","Oat (Avena sativa L.) seed extracts exhibited a high degree of catalytic activity including amylase activities. Proteins in the oat seed extracts were optimized for their amylolytic activities. Oat extract with amylolytic activity was separated by SDS-PAGE and a major protein band with an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa was subjected to tryptic digestion. The generated amino acid sequences were analyzed by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS/MS) and database searches. These sequences were used to identify a partial cDNA from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of A. sativa L. Based upon EST sequences, a predicted full-length gene was identified, with an open reading frame of 1464 bp encoding a protein of 488 amino acid residues (AsBAMY), with a theoretical molecular mass of 55 kDa identified as a β-amylase belonging to the plant β-amylase family. Primary structure of oat β-amylase (AsBAMY) protein indicated high similarity with other β-amylase from other cereals such as wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and rye (Secale cereale) with two conserved Glu residues (E184 and E378) assigned as the “putative” catalytic residues which would act as an acid and base pair in the catalytic process. In addition, a 3D-model of AsBAMY was built from known X-ray structures and sequence alignments. A similar core (β/α)8-barrel architecture was found in AsBAMY like the other cereal β-amylases with a specific location of the active site in a pocket-like cavity structure made at one end of this core (β/α)8-barrel domain suggesting an accessibility of the non-reducing end of the substrate and thus confirming the results of AsBAMY exo-acting hydrolase."

"27107183","abstracttext","Basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors (TFs) comprise a large TF family and act as crucial regulators in various biological processes in plants. Here, we report the functional characterization of TabHLH1, a bHLH TF member in wheat (Triticum aestivum). TabHLH1 shares conserved bHLH domain and targets to nucleus with transactivation activity. Upon Pi and N deprivation, the expression of TabHLH1 was up-regulated in roots and leaves, showing a pattern to be gradually increased within 23-h treatment regimes. The lines with overexpression of TabHLH1 exhibited drastically improved tolerance to Pi and N deprivation, showing larger plant phenotype, more biomass, higher concentration and more accumulation of P and N than wild type (WT) upon the Pi- and N-starvation stresses. NtPT1 and NtNRT2.2, the genes encoding phosphate transporter (PT) and nitrate transporter (NRT) in tobacco, respectively, showed up-regulated expression in TabHLH1-overexpressing plants; knockdown expression of them led to deteriorated growth feature, lowered biomass, and decreased nutrient accumulation of plants under Pi- and N-deficient conditions. Compared with WT, the TabHLH1-overexpressing plants also showed lowered reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and improved antioxidant enzyme (AE) activities, such as those of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and peroxidase (POD). NtSOD1, NtCAT1, and NtPOD1;6 that encode SOD, CAT, and POD, respectively, were up-regulated in TabHLH1-overexpressing plants. Further knockdown of these AE gene expression caused reduced antioxidant enzymatic activities, indicative of their crucial roles in mediating cellular ROS homeostasis in Pi- and N-starvation conditions. Together, TabHLH1 plays an important role in mediating adaptation to the Pi- and N-starvation stresses through transcriptional regulation of a set of genes encoding PT, NRT and AEs that mediate the taken up of Pi and N and the cellular homeostasis of ROS initiated by the nutrient stresses."

"29016965","abstracttext","High salinity is one of the most severe environmental stresses and limits the growth and yield of diverse crop plants. We isolated a gene named TaPUB1 from wheat (Triticum aestivum L. cv HF9703) that encodes a novel protein containing a U-box domain, the precursor RNA processing 19p (Prp19) superfamily and WD-40 repeats. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that TaPUB1 transcript accumulation was up-regulated by high salinity, drought and phytohormones, suggesting that it plays a role in the abiotic-related defense response. We overexpressed TaPUB1 in Nicotiana benthamiana to evaluate the function of TaPUB1 in the regulation of the salt stress response. Transgenic N. benthamiana plants (OE) with constitutively overexpressed TaPUB1 under the control of the Cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV 35S) promoter exhibited a higher germination rate, less growth inhibition, less Chl loss and higher photosynthetic capacity than wild-type (WT) plants under salt stress conditions. These results demonstrated the increased tolerance of OE plants to salt stress compared with the WT. The OE plants had lower osmotic potential (OP), reduced Na+ toxicity and less reactive oxygen species accumulation compared with the WT, which may be related to their higher level of osmolytes, lower Na+/K+ ratio and higher antioxidant enzyme activities under salt stress conditions. Consistent with these results, the up-regulated expression of osmic- and antioxidant-related genes in OE plants indicated a role for TaPUB1 in plant salt tolerance."
"28034954","articletitle","A Flowering Locus C Homolog Is a Vernalization-Regulated Repressor in Brachypodium and Is Cold Regulated in Wheat."
"28034954","abstracttext","Winter cereals require prolonged cold to transition from vegetative to reproductive development. This process, referred to as vernalization, has been extensively studied in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In Arabidopsis, a key flowering repressor called FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) quantitatively controls the vernalization requirement. By contrast, in cereals, the vernalization response is mainly regulated by the VERNALIZATION genes, VRN1 and VRN2 Here, we characterize ODDSOC2, a recently identified FLC ortholog in monocots, knowing that it belongs to the FLC lineage. By studying its expression in a diverse set of Brachypodium accessions, we find that it is a good predictor of the vernalization requirement. Analyses of transgenics demonstrated that BdODDSOC2 functions as a vernalization-regulated flowering repressor. In most Brachypodium accessions BdODDSOC2 is down-regulated by cold, and in one of the winter accessions in which this down-regulation was evident, BdODDSOC2 responded to cold before BdVRN1. When stably down-regulated, the mechanism is associated with spreading H3K27me3 modifications at the BdODDSOC2 chromatin. Finally, homoeolog-specific gene expression analyses identify TaAGL33 and its splice variant TaAGL22 as the FLC orthologs in wheat (Triticum aestivum) behaving most similar to Brachypodium ODDSOC2 Overall, our study suggests that ODDSOC2 is not only phylogenetically related to FLC in eudicots but also functions as a flowering repressor in the vernalization pathway of Brachypodium and likely other temperate grasses. These insights could prove useful in breeding efforts to refine the vernalization requirement of temperate cereals and adapt varieties to changing climates."

"28751901","abstracttext","Drought, salinity, and cold are the major factors limiting wheat quality and productivity; it is thus highly desirable to characterize the abiotic-stress-inducible promoters suitable for the genetic improvement of plant resistance. The sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase 2 ( SnRK2 ) family genes show distinct regulatory properties in response to abiotic stresses. The present study characterized the approximately 3000-bp upstream sequence (the 313 bp upstream of the ATG was the transcription start site) of the Triticum aestivum TaSnRK2.8 promoter under abscisic acid (ABA) and abiotic stresses. Four different-length 5' deletion fragments of TaSnRK2.8 promoter were fused with the GUS reporter gene and transformed into Arabidopsis . Tissue expression analysis showed that the TaSnRK2.8 promoter region from position -1481 to -821 contained the stalk-specific elements, and the region from position -2631 to -1481 contained the leaf- and root-specific elements. In the ABA-treated seedlings, the deletion analysis showed that the TaSnRK2.8 promoter region from position -821 to -2631 contained ABA response elements. The abiotic stress responses of the TaSnRK2.8 promoter derivatives demonstrated that they harbored abiotic-stress response elements: the region from position -821 to -408 harbored the osmotic-stress response elements, whereas the region from position -2631 to -1481 contained the positive regulatory motifs and the region from position -1481 to -821 contained the leaf- and stalk-specific enhancers. Further deletion analysis of the promoter region from position -821 to -408 indicated that a 125-bp region from position -693 to -568 was required to induce an osmotic-stress response. These results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of TaSnRK2.8 in response to abiotic stresses, and the TaSnRK2.8 promoter seems to be a candidate for regulating the expression of abiotic stress response genes in transgenic plants."

"28808769","abstracttext_key message","Freezing tolerance in taft plants relied more upon an ABA-independent- than an ABA-dependent antifreeze signaling pathway. Two wheat (Triticum aestivum) near isogenic lines (NIL) named tafs (freezing sensitivity) and taft (freezing tolerance) were isolated in the laboratory and their various cytological and physiological characteristics under freezing conditions were studied. Proplastid, cell membrane, and mitochondrial ultrastructure were less damaged by freezing treatment in taft than tafs plants. Chlorophyll, ATP, and thylakoid membrane protein contents were significantly higher, but malondialdehyde content was significantly lower in taft than tafs plants under freezing condition. Antioxidant capacity, as indicated by reactive oxygen species accumulation and antioxidant enzyme activity, and the relative gene expression were significantly greater in taft than tafs plants. Soluble sugars and abscisic acid (ABA) contents were significantly higher in taft plants than in tafs plants under both normal and freezing conditions. The upregulated expression levels of certain freezing tolerance-related genes were greater in taft than tafs plants under freezing treatment. The addition of sodium tungstate, an ABA synthesis inhibitor, led to only partial freezing tolerance inhibition in taft plants and the down-regulated expression of some ABA-dependent genes. Thus, both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signaling pathways are involved in the freezing tolerance of taft plants. At the same time, freezing tolerance in taft plants relied more upon an ABA-independent- than an ABA-dependent antifreeze signaling pathway."

Natural products produced by microorganisms have played an important role in the history of drug discovery, particularly in the anticancer and anti-infective areas. The plant rhizosphere ecosystem is a rich resource for the discovery of actinomycetes with potential applications in pharmaceutical science, especially Streptomyces . We screened Streptomyces -like strains from the rhizosphere soil of wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.) in Hebei province, China, and thirty-nine strains were obtained. Among them, the extracts of 14 isolates inhibited the growth of colon tumor cell line HCT-116. Strain NEAU-wh-3-1 exhibited better inhibitory activity, and its active ingredients were further studied. Then, 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain NEAU-wh3-1 with high sequence similarities to Embleya scabrispora DSM 41855 T (99.65%), Embleya hyalina MB891-A1 T (99.45%), and Streptomyces lasii 5H-CA11 T (98.62%). Moreover, multilocus sequence analysis based on the five other house-keeping genes ( atp D, gyr B, rpo B, rec A, and trp B) and polyphasic taxonomic approach comprising chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic, morphological, and physiological characterization indicated that the isolate should be assigned to the genus Embleya and was different from its closely related strains, therefore, it is proposed that strain NEAU-wh3-1 may be classified as representatives of a novel species of the genus Embleya . Furthermore, active substances in the fermentation broth of strain NEAU-wh-3-1 were isolated by bioassay-guided analysis and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS) analyses. Consequently, one new Zincophorin analogue together with seven known compounds was detected.

"32351520","abstracttext","Septoria tritici blotch (STB) is caused by the ascomycete Zymoseptoria tritici and one of the predominating diseases in wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) in Europe. The control of STB is highly reliant on frequent fungicide applications. The primary objective of this study was to assess sensitivity levels of Z. tritici to different fungicide groups. The fungicides included in this study were epoxiconazole, prothioconazole-desthio, tebuconazole, and fluxapyroxad. A panel of 63 isolates from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and 10 isolates from Finland were tested. Fungicide sensitivity testing was carried out as a bioassay analyzing single pycnidium isolates on different fungicide concentrations. The average EC 50 value in Baltic countries and Finland to epoxiconazole was high ranging from 1.04 to 2.19 ppm. For prothioconazole-desthio and tebuconazole, EC 50 varied from 0.01 to 0.24 ppm, and 1.25 to 18.23 ppm, respectively. The average EC 50 value for fluxapyroxad varied from 0.07 to 0.33 ppm. To explain the range of sensitivity, the samples were analyzed for CYP51 and Sdh mutations, as well as cytb G143A, CYP51 overexpression, and multidrug resistance (MDR). Frequencies of ZtCYP51 mutations D134G, V136A/C, A379G, I381V, and S524T in the Finnish-Baltic region were lower than in other European countries, but have increased compared to previous years. The frequency of cytb G143A conferring strobilurin resistance also augmented to 50-70% in the Z. tritici populations from Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania. No Sdh mutations were found in this study, and neither strains of MDR phenotypes. However, we found a strain harboring a previously unknown transposon insertion in the promoter of the MFS1 gene, involved in drug efflux and multi-drug resistance. This new insert, however, does not confer an MDR phenotype to the strain."

"30047240","abstracttext","Many obligately parasitic pathogens absorb nutrients from host plants via specialized infection structures, called haustoria and infection hyphae, to further colonization and growth in the host plant. In the wheat (Triticum aestivum) stripe rust fungus, Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MAPKK) PsFUZ7 is involved in the regulation of haustorium formation and invasive growth. Here, we functionally characterized PsKPP4 of Pst, which is homologous to the yeast MAPKKK STE11. Similar to the silencing of PsFUZ7, the knockdown of PsKPP4 was detected in the vegetative hyphae and haustoria, resulting in the reduced pathogenicity of Pst. Pst urediniospores treated with the STE11 MAPKKK activation inhibitor produced deformed germ tubes. In addition, overexpression of PsKPP4 in fission yeast resulted in the production of fusiform cells and increased tolerance of yeast cells to oxidative stress. The transformation of PsKPP4 into the mst11 mutant of Magnaporthe oryzae partially restored mst11 function. The PsKPP4 protein contains a sterile alpha motif (SAM), Ras association (RA) and kinase domains, similar to its homologues in other fungi. Yeast two-hybrid assays revealed that the SAM domain is essential for the interaction between PsKPP4 and PsUBC2, a homologue of Ustilago maydis UBC2, known to interact with KPP4, which is associated with the regulation of the Fus3 cascade. Host-induced gene silencing of PsUBC2 reduced the pathogenicity of Pst slightly, indicating that PsUBC2 also plays a minor role in the regulation of the infection pathway of Pst. These observations indicate that PsKPP4, interacting with PsUBC2, may play an important role in the regulation of infection-related morphogenesis in Pst."

"30605073","abstracttext","A novel actinomycete, designated strain NEAU-D10 T , was isolated from rhizosphere soil of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) collected from Northeast Agricultural University in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, north-east China. A polyphasic approach was employed to determine the status of strain NEAU-D10 T . Morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics were consistent with those of members of the genus Streptomyces. The menaquinones detected were MK-9 (H6), MK-9 (H8) and MK-9 (H4). The phospholipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, hydroxy-phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and three unidentified lipids. The major fatty acids were identified as iso-C16 : 0, C16 : 0, anteiso-C15 : 0 and iso-C14 : 0. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that strain NEAU-D10 T belongs to the genus Streptomyces with high sequence similarity to Streptomyces sioyaensis DSM 40032 T (99.0 %) and Streptomyces auratus DSM 41897 T (98.8 %). Moreover, multilocus sequence analysis based on five other housekeeping genes (atpD, gyrB, rpoB, recAand trpB) and the low level of DNA-DNA relatedness and phenotypic differences allowed the novel isolate to be differentiated from its most closely related strains, S. sioyaensis DSM 40032 T and S. auratus DSM 41897 T . It is concluded that the organism can be classified as representing a novel species of the genus Streptomyces, for which the name Streptomycesinhibens sp. nov. is proposed.

"30802259","abstracttext","Several model plants are known to respond to bacterial quorum sensing molecules with altered root growth and gene expression patterns and induced resistance to plant pathogens. These compounds may represent novel elicitors that could be applied as seed primers to enhance cereal crop resistance to pathogens and abiotic stress and to improve yields. We investigated whether the acyl-homoserine lactone N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL) impacted winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seed germination, plant development and productivity, using two Ukrainian varieties, Volodarka and Yatran 60, in both in vitro experiments and field trials. In vitro germination experiments indicated that C6-HSL seed priming had a small but significant positive impact on germination levels (1.2x increase, p < 0.0001), coleoptile and radicle development (1.4x increase, p < 0.0001). Field trials over two growing seasons (2015-16 and 2016-17) also demonstrated significant improvements in biomass at the tillering stage (1.4x increase, p < 0.0001), and crop structure and productivity at maturity including grain yield (1.4-1.5x increase, p < 0.0007) and quality (1.3x increase in good grain, p < 0.0001). In some cases variety effects were observed (p ≤ 0.05) suggesting that the effect of C6-HSL seed priming might depend on plant genetics, and some benefits of priming were also evident in F1 plants grown from seeds collected the previous season (p ≤ 0.05). These field-scale findings suggest that bacterial acyl-homoserine lactones such as C6-HSL could be used to improve cereal crop growth and yield and reduce reliance on fungicides and fertilisers to combat pathogens and stress."

"30326657","abstracttext","Aquaporins (AQPs) are transmembrane proteins essential for controlling the flow of water and other molecules required for development and stress tolerance in plants, including important crop species such as wheat ( Triticum aestivum ). In this study, we utilized a genomic approach for analyzing the information about AQPs available in public databases to characterize their structure and function. Furthermore, we validated the expression of a suite of AQP genes, at the transcriptional level, including accessions with contrasting responses to drought, different organs and water stress levels. We found 65 new AQP genes, from which 60% are copies expanded by polyploidization. Sequence analysis of the AQP genes showed that the purifying selection pressure acted on duplicate genes, which was related to a high conservation of the functions. This situation contrasted with the expression patterns observed for different organs, developmental stages or genotypes under water deficit conditions, which indicated functional divergence at transcription. Expression analyses on contrasting genotypes showed high gene transcription from Tonoplast Intrinsic Protein 1 (TIP1) and 2 (TIP2), and Plasma Membrane Intrinsic Protein 1 (PIP1) and 2 (PIP2) subfamilies in roots and from TIP1 and PIP1 subfamilies in leaves. Interestingly, during severe drought stress, 4 TIP genes analyzed in leaves of the tolerant accession reached up to 15-fold the level observed at the susceptible genotype, suggesting a positive relationship with drought tolerance. The obtained results extend our understanding of the structure and function of AQPs, particularly under water stress conditions."

"30681925","abstracttext","Leaf rust (LR) caused by Puccinia triticina, is among the most important diseases of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops globally. Deployment of cultivars incorporating genetic resistance, such as adult plant resistance (APR) or all-stage resistance, is considered the most sustainable control method. APR is preferred for durability because it places lower selection pressure on the pathogen and is often polygenic. In the search for new sources of APR, here we explored a diversity panel sourced from the N. I. Vavilov Institute of Plant Genetic Resources. Based on DNA marker screening, 83 of the 300 lines were deemed to carry known APR genes; namely, Lr34, Lr46, and Lr67. Interestingly, lines carrying Lr67 were mostly landraces from India and Pakistan, reconfirming the likely origin of the gene. Rapid phenotypic screening using a method that integrates assessment at both seedling and adult growth stages under accelerated growth conditions (i.e., constant light and controlled temperature) identified 50 lines carrying APR. Levels of APR corresponded well with phenotypes obtained in a field nursery inoculated using the same pathotype (R 2 = 0.82). The second year of field testing, using a mixture of pathotypes with additional virulence for race-specific APR genes (Lr13 and Lr37), identified a subset of 13 lines that consistently displayed high levels of APR across years and pathotypes. These lines provide useful sources of resistance for future research. A strategy combining rapid generation advance coupled with phenotyping under controlled conditions could accelerate introgression of these potentially novel alleles into adapted genetic backgrounds."

"31372943","abstracttext","Abiotic stresses such as salinity, drought and excessive heat are associated with significant loss of crop productivity globally, and require effective strategies for their reduction or tolerance. Biofilm-forming rhizobacteria, which harbor multifarious plant growth promoting traits and tolerance to abiotic stress, are believed to benefit plant health and production even under environmental stresses. The primary objective of this study was to investigate indigenous biofilm-forming rhizobacteria (Pseudomonas spp., Bacillus sp., Pantoea sp., Brevibacterium sp. and Acinetobacter sp.) for their functional diversity relevant to plant growth promoting activities, biofilm development and tolerance to abiotic stress conditions. The most promising isolates among FAP1, FAP2, FAP3, FAP4, FAP5, FAP10, FAB1, FAB3 and FAA1 were selected. Rhizobacteria exhibited high tolerance to salinity (1.5 M NaCl) and drought stress (up to 55% PEG-6000) conditions in vitro. The isolates demonstrated varying levels of PGP activities (IAA production and phosphate solubilization), biofilm development, and production of alginate and exopolysaccharides in the presence of salinity, drought stress and elevated temperature. Further efficacy of the isolates was demonstrated by inoculating to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) plants in greenhouse conditions under both normal and drought stress for up to 30 days inoculation. The plant growth potential of the isolates was in the order of FAP3 > FAB3 > FAB1 > FAP10 > FAP5 > FAP4 > FAA1 > FAP2 > FAP1. The present study resulted in successful selection of promising PGPR as identified by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. Field study is needed to evaluate their relative performance in both 'normal' and stressed environments in order to be exploited for plant stress management."

"33170771","abstracttext","Zymoseptoria tritici is the causal agent of Septoria tritici blotch (STB), a disease of wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) that results in significant yield loss worldwide. Z. tritici 's life cycle, reproductive system, effective population size, and gene flow put it at high likelihood of developing fungicide resistance. Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor (SDHI) fungicides (FRAC code 7) were not widely used to control STB in the Willamette Valley until 2016. Field isolates of Z. tritici collected in the Willamette Valley at dates spanning the introduction of SDHI (2015 to 2017) were screened for sensitivity to four SDHI active ingredients: benzovindiflupyr, penthiopyrad, fluxapyroxad, and fluindapyr. Fungicide sensitivity changes were determined by the fungicide concentration at which fungal growth is decreased by 50% (EC 50 ) values. The benzovindiflupyr EC 50 values increased significantly, indicating a reduction in sensitivity, following the adoption of SDHI fungicides in Oregon ( P < 0.0001). Additionally, significant reduction in cross-sensitivity among SDHI active ingredients was also observed with a moderate and significant relationship between penthiopyrad and benzovindiflupyr ( P = 0.0002) and a weak relationship between penthiopyrad and fluxapyroxad ( P = 0.0482). No change in cross-sensitivity was observed with fluindapyr, which has not yet been labeled in the region. The results document a decrease in SDHI sensitivity in Z. tritici isolates following the introduction of the active ingredients to the Willamette Valley. The reduction in cross-sensitivity observed between SDHI active ingredients highlights the notion that careful consideration is required to manage fungicide resistance and suggests that within-group rotation is insufficient for resistance management."
"30708482","articletitle","First Report of Resistance to QoI Fungicides in North American Populations of Zymoseptoria tritici, Causal Agent of Septoria Tritici Blotch of Wheat."
"30708482","abstracttext","The G143A mutation in cytb (cytochrome b gene) is associated with high levels of resistance to quinone outside inhibitor (QoI or strobilurin) fungicides that disrupt electron transport during cellular respiration (1). The G143A mutation in Zymoseptoria tritici (synonyms: Mycosphaerella graminicola and Septoria tritici), the causal agent of septoria tritici blotch of wheat (Triticum aestivum), was first reported in Europe in 2001 (1). Although Z. tritici has a global distribution (3), G143A mutants of Z. tritici have not been reported outside of Europe. We used PCR-RFLP (4) to estimate the frequencies of G143A mutants in Z. tritici populations at two locations in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon: the Hyslop Crop Science Field Research Laboratory (Hyslop Farm, HF), Benton County (44°37'52.85″ N, 123°11'55.19″ W) and research plots planted in a commercial wheat field in Washington County (45°33'58.53″ N, 123°00'11.78″ W) (North Valley Farm, NVF). Isolates originated from flag leaf collections from two cultivars ('Bobtail' and 'Tubbs 06') made in April and June of 2012 from plants in a replicated fungicide-treatment experiment, with isolates collected from both sprayed and unsprayed plots. Sixteen of the 169 isolates (9.5%) from HF possessed the G143A mutation (7 of 132 isolates from plots not receiving a QoI fungicide and 9 of 37 isolates collected from plots receiving two applications of the QoI azoxystrobin). One hundred forty six of the 175 isolates (83.4%) from NVF were G143A mutants (101 of 129 isolates from plots receiving no QoI fungicide and 45 of 46 isolates from plots receiving two applications of azoxystrobin). Results of phenotypic assays of a subset of 10 isolates from each location (5 mutants, 5 wild types from each location; 20 isolates altogether) supported a high level of resistance to azoxystrobin only in the G143A mutants. All 10 G143A mutants developed colonies after 8 days of growth on YMA plates amended with SHAM (2) and 1 ppm or 10 ppm azoxystrobin, with nine and eight G143A mutant isolates developing colonies on plates amended with 1 ppm and 10 ppm azoxystrobin, respectively. None of the wild-type isolates developed colonies on plates amended with SHAM and 1 ppm azoxystrobin, nor on plates amended with SHAM and 10 ppm azoxystrobin. All 20 isolates developed colonies on YMA plates lacking azoxystrobin, and treatments produced identical results across three replicates. These results are consistent with findings of higher levels of azoxystrobin resistance in G143A mutants compared to wild types in European populations (1). Isolates from HF and NVF differ in their previous exposure to QoI fungicides. The majority of the wheat area at HF is planted to breeding plots that are not sprayed with fungicide. Plots at NVF were planted in a commercial wheat field in a county where most wheat fields were treated with two to three applications of strobilurins each year over the past 4 years. Future monitoring for G143A mutants of Z. tritici throughout its range in North America will be necessary to assess whether strobilurin resistance will spread via wind-dispersal of ascospores or emerge de novo in treated fields. In Europe, stobilurins were first applied to wheat in 1996. G143A mutants of Z. tritici emerged de novo several times (4) and were widespread by 2007. References: (1) B. A. Fraaje et al.

"30699773","articletitle","First Report of Fusarium pseudograminearum from Wheat Heads with Fusarium Head Blight in North China Plain."
"30699773","abstracttext","Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), the most widely grown winter cereal crop in China, was grown on 24.3 million hectares in 2012. There was an outbreak of Fusarium head blight in 2012, and it was prevalent in 2013 in North China Plain, the largest area producing winter wheat in China. In 2013, a total of 213 Fusarium graminearum-like isolates were collected from diseased wheat heads in 33 fields in 17 counties in Henan province. The pathogen was isolated from the base of Fusarium-damaged spikelets on potato dextrose agar (PDA) after being surface-sterilized (70% EtOH for 30 s and 3% NaClO for 1.5 min) and rinsed three times in sterilized distilled water. After 3 days, the mycelia were transferred to fresh PDA and purified by the single-spore isolation method. Species were identified based on morphological characteristics (2), and sequence analysis of the translation elongation factor-1α (TEF) and trichothecene 3-O-acetyltransferase (Tri 101) gene (3). The results indicated that F. graminearum species complex (97.2%) is the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight in this region. However, four strains (2%) from the two fields in Jiao Zuo and Xin Xiang counties were found to be identical to F. pseudograminearum. The four (13JZ3-1, 13JZ3-2, 13XX1-2, and 13XX1-6) isolates of F. pseudograminearum were transferred onto carnation leaf agar (CLA) and incubated at 20°C under black light blue illumination. On CLA, macroconidia were abundant, relatively slender, curved to almost straight, commonly six- to seven-septate, and averaged 49.7 × 5.0 μm. Microconidia were not observed. Chlamydospores were observed after 4 weeks. The fungus was initially identified as F. graminearum on the basis of morphology of the asexual stage (2). However, the TEF sequences (Accession nos. KJ863322 to KJ863325) showed 99 to 100% similarity with several F. pseudograminearum sequences (e.g., AF212468, AF212469, and AF212470); the Tri 101 sequences (KJ863326 to KJ863329) showed 99 to 100% similarity with accession nos. AF212615 and AF212616 of F. pseudograminearum. The identification was further confirmed by the F. pseudograminearum species-specific PCR primers (Fp1-1: CGGGGTAGTTTCACATTTCCG and Fp1-2: GAGAATGTGATGACGACAATA) (1). To complete Koch's postulates, the pathogenicity of the fungus was tested by spraying five healthy inflorescences (average of 19 spikelets per spike) of wheat cultivar Zhoumai 18 with a 5-ml suspension (5 × 10 4 conidia per milliliter). Another five healthy inflorescences were sprayed with sterile distilled water. Plants were placed in a growth chamber with a 12-h photoperiod at 22°C, covered with polyethylene bags that were removed after 2 days. Seven days later, while control inflorescences were asymptomatic, inoculated inflorescences showed a mean of 10 bleached spikelets per spike. By using the methodology described above, the fungus was re-isolated from infected spikelets of inoculated wheat heads but not from the controls. To our knowledge, this is the first report of F. pseudograminearum from diseased wheat heads in China. Further investigation is needed to gain a better understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of this new pathogen. References: (1) T. Aoki and K. O'Donnell. Mycologia 91:597, 1999. (2) J. F.

"30841334","abstracttext","In much of the world, resistance to stem rust in wheat, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, is based at least in part on the gene Sr31. During February 1999, high levels of stem rust infection were observed on entries in wheat (Triticum aestivum) grown in a nursery at Kalengyere Research Station in Uganda. Because several of the rusted entries were known to carry the 1BL-1RS chromosome translocation containing the Sr31, Lr26, and Yr9 genes for rust resistance, virulence to Sr31 was suspected. Urediniospores, collected in bulk from rusted stems of seven entries containing Sr31, were suspended in light mineral oil and sprayed on primary leaves of 7-day-old seedlings of South African wheat cv. Gamtoos (=Veery #3, pedigree: Kvz/Buho'S'//Kal/BB). Plants were kept overnight at 19 to 21°C in a dew chamber before placement in a greenhouse at 18 to 25°C. After ≈14 days, urediniospores were collected from large, susceptible-type stem rust pustules and subsequently increased on Gamtoos, which served as a selective host for the new rust culture, designated Pgt-Ug99. Pathogenicity of Pgt-Ug99 was studied in seedling tests of available wheats containing Sr31, as well as other stem rust differential lines. All seedling tests were conducted at least three times in independent inoculations. Isolate Pgt-Ug99 was not virulent to Avocet'S'/Yr9 (Australian line containing Sr26) or Oom Charl (South African cultivar) but was virulent to the other Sr31 testers: Alondra 'S', Bobwhite, Chokka, Clement, Federation/Kavkaz, Gamtoos, Grebe, Kavkaz, Letaba, Line E/Kavkaz, RL6078, and Veery 'S'. Virulence to Sr31 (infection types [ITs] 3 - 3 to 3 ++ 4) was clearly contrasted by the low reactions (ITs 0; to 1) produced by UVPgt53, a South African pathotype avirulent to Sr31. According to the reactions of the differential lines, Pgt-Ug99 is avirulent to Sr21, -22, -24, -25, -26, -27, -29, -32, -33, -34, -35, -36, -39, -40, -42, and -43, Agi, and Em and virulent to Sr5, -6, -7b, -8a, -8b, -9b, -9e, -9g, -11, -15, -17, -30, -31, and -38. Virulence to the T. ventricosum-derived gene Sr38, which is linked to Lr37 and Yr17 and occurs in cultivars from Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, was not known previously (1). Both Pgt-Ug99 and UVPgt53 produced a continuum of ITs (; to 2+3) on Petkus rye (obtained from the USDA-ARS National Small Grains Collection, Aberdeen, ID), the original Sr31 donor source. Pgt-Ug99 did not appear more virulent than UVPgt53 on Petkus. All triticales tested, as well as oat cv. Overberg, were highly resistant to Pgt-Ug99. According to McIntosh et al. (1), Huerta-Espino mentioned a Sr31-virulent culture from Turkey, but this could not be confirmed. Should the Sr31-virulent pathotype migrate out of Uganda, it poses a major threat to wheat production in countries where the leading cultivars have resistance based on this gene. Reference: (1) R. A.

"28087646","abstracttext","The wheat curl mite, Aceria tosichella Keifer, (WCM) is a global pest of bread wheat that reduces yields significantly. In addition, WCM carries Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV, family Potyviridae, genus Tritimovirus), the most significant wheat virus in North America; High Plains wheat mosaic virus (HPWMoV, genus Emaravirus, formerly High plains virus); and Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV, family Potyviridae, genus Poacevirus). Viruses carried by WCM have reduced wheat yields throughout the U.S. Great Plains for >50 yr, with average yield losses of 2-3% and occasional yield losses of 7-10%. Acaricides are ineffective against WCM, and delayed planting of winter wheat is not feasible. Five wheat breeding lines containing Cmc4, a WCM resistance gene from Aegilops tauschii, and Wsm2, a WSMV resistance gene from wheat germplasm CO960293-2 were selected from the breeding process and assessed for phenotypic reaction to WCM feeding, population increase, and the degree of WSMV, HPWMoV, and TriMV infection. Experiments determined that all five lines are resistant to WCM biotype 1 feeding and population increase, and that two breeding lines contain resistance to WSMV, HPWMoV, and TriMV infection as well. These WCM-, WSMV-, HPWMoV-, and TriMV-resistant genotypes can be used improve management of wheat yield losses from WCM-virus complexes."
"33193713","articletitle","Transcriptomic Study for Identification of Major Nitrogen Stress Responsive Genes in Australian Bread Wheat Cultivars."
"33193713","abstracttext","High nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in bread wheat is pivotal to sustain high productivity. Knowledge about the physiological and transcriptomic changes that regulate NUE, in particular how plants cope with nitrogen (N) stress during flowering and the grain filling period, is crucial in achieving high NUE. Nitrogen response is differentially manifested in different tissues and shows significant genetic variability. A comparative transcriptome study was carried out using RNA-seq analysis to investigate the effect of nitrogen levels on gene expression at 0 days post anthesis (0 DPA) and 10 DPA in second leaf and grain tissues of three Australian wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) varieties that were known to have varying NUEs. A total of 12,344 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified under nitrogen stress where down-regulated DEGs were predominantly associated with carbohydrate metabolic process, photosynthesis, light-harvesting, and defense response, whereas the up-regulated DEGs were associated with nucleotide metabolism, proteolysis, and transmembrane transport under nitrogen stress. Protein-protein interaction and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways analysis further revealed that highly interacted down-regulated DEGs were involved in light-harvesting and photosynthesis, and up-regulated DEGs were mostly involved in steroid biosynthesis under N stress. The common down-regulated genes across the cultivars included photosystem II 10 kDa polypeptide family proteins, plant protein 1589 of uncharacterized protein function, etc., whereas common up-regulated genes included glutamate carboxypeptidase 2, placenta-specific8 (PLAC8) family protein, and a sulfate transporter. On the other hand, high NUE cultivar Mace responded to nitrogen stress by down-regulation of a stress-related gene annotated as beta-1,3-endoglucanase and pathogenesis-related protein (PR-4, PR-1) and up-regulation of MYB/SANT domain-containing RADIALIS (RAD)-like transcription factors. The medium NUE cultivar Spitfire and low NUE cultivar Volcani demonstrated strong down-regulation of Photosystem II 10 kDa polypeptide family protein and predominant up-regulation of 11S globulin seed storage protein 2 and protein transport protein Sec61 subunit gamma. In grain tissue, most of the DEGs were related to nitrogen metabolism and proteolysis. The DEGs with high abundance in high NUE cultivar can be good candidates to develop nitrogen stress-tolerant variety with improved NUE."

"32852846","abstracttext","Wheat blast caused by the Triticum pathotype of Pyricularia oryzae poses a serious threat to wheat production in South America and Asia and is now becoming a pandemic disease. Here, we show that Rmg8, a promising wheat gene for resistance breeding, is suppressed by PWT4, an effector gene of P. oryzae, and in turn that the suppression is counteracted by Rwt4, a wheat gene recognizing PWT4. When PWT4 was introduced into a wheat blast isolate carrying AVR-Rmg8 (an avirulence gene corresponding to Rmg8), PWT4 suppressed wheat resistance conferred by Rmg8. PWT4 did not alter the expression of AVR-Rmg8, but higher expression of PWT4 led to more efficient suppression. This suppression was observed in rwt4 carriers, but not in Rwt4 carriers, indicating that it is counteracted by Rwt4. PWT4 was assumed to have been horizontally transferred from a weed-associated cryptic species, P. pennisetigena, to an Avena isolate of P. oryzae in Brazil. This implies a potential risk of the acquisition of PWT4 by the wheat blast fungus and the 'breakdown' of Rmg8. We suggest that Rmg8 should be introduced together with Rwt4 into a wheat cultivar when it is used for resistance breeding."

"24177942","abstracttext","The leaf rust resistance gene, Lr18, of common wheat cultivars has been derived from Triticum timopheevi and is located on chromosome arm 5BL. Chromosome banding (N-banding) analyses revealed that in the wheat cultivars carrying Lr18 that were examined, which had been bred in 6 different countries, chromosome arm 5BL possessed a specific terminal band not carried by their susceptible parental cultivars. It was suggested that this terminal N-band was introduced from T. timopheevi together with Lr18. N-banding analysis of a T. timopheevi strain showed that one of two timopheevi chromosomes had provided Japanese wheat lines containing Lr18 with the terminal band."
"30708409","articletitle","First Report of Stolbur Phytoplasma Associated with Maize Redness Disease of Maize in Bosnia and Herzegovina."
"30708409","abstracttext","Maize redness (MR), caused by stolbur phytoplasma (16SrXII-A, 'Candidatus phytoplasma solani') and vectored by the cixiid planthopper Reptalus panzeri (Löw), is a severe and emerging disease of maize in southeastern Europe (2). Symptoms of MR include midrib, leaf, and stalk reddening, followed by desiccation of the entire plant, abnormal ear development, and incomplete kernel set. MR may cause significant economic losses (2). During 2010, 2011, and 2012, the presence of MR-like symptoms on maize accompanied by significant yield losses were frequently observed in maize fields in the Semberija region of northeastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. From mid-June to early July, potential vectors were collected using mouth-aspirators from maize plants in fields at three locations in the Semberija region where MR-like symptoms were previously observed. At the end of July, symptomatic maize plants were collected from six fields in the same region for phytoplasma identification. In addition, we sampled asymptomatic johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense L.), bindweed (Convolvulus arvensis L.), and volunteer wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in areas adjacent to maize fields with MR-like symptoms, as potential phytoplasma reservoirs (2,3). A total of 49 plants (38 maize, 6 johnsongrass, 3 bindweed, and 2 wheat) and 43 R. panzeri were tested for the presence of stolbur phytoplasma. Leaves of four maize seedlings, grown in insect-proof greenhouse conditions, were used as controls. Total DNA was extracted from roots of each plant and R. panzeri using the CTAB methods (2). Initial phytoplasma detection was conducted on 16S rRNA gene using nested PCR assay with phytoplasma universal primers P1/P7 and F2n/R2 (4). Subsequently, all phytoplasma positive samples were retested employing stolbur-specific Stol11 protocol with the f2r/f3r2 primer set (1). Molecular characterization of identified phytoplasmas was performed by PCR-RFLP analysis of the tuf gene (3) and by sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA nested PCR products (GenBank Accession No. KC852868). All samples that tested positive on 16S rRNA gene using phytoplasma generic primers gave positive reaction in assays with stolbur-specific primers. Stolbur phytoplasma was identified in 36 of 49 plant samples (34 of 38 symptomatic maize plants and in 2 of 6 johnsongrass) and in 2 of 43 R. panzeri individuals. None of the control plants, bindweed, or wheat samples were positive for the presence of any phytoplasma. Tuf gene RFLP analyses enabled affiliation of all isolates to the stolbur type tuf-b. Comparison of the 16S rRNA sequence using BLAST analyses further confirmed identification of the phytoplasmas as being 'Candidatus phytoplasma solani.' The obtained sequence showed 100% identity with 'Candidatus phytoplasma solani' from corn in Serbia (JQ730750). These data clearly demonstrated association of stolbur phytoplasma with MR symptoms on maize in Semberija, which represents the first report of the MR disease and stolbur phytoplasma in maize, R. panzeri, and johnsongrass in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the Semberija region, maize-wheat crop rotation is a traditional practice, which is a key factor for MR occurrence and persistence (2). References: (1) D. Clair et al. Vitis 42:151, 2003. (2) J.

"29767554","articletitle","A New Resistance Gene in Combination with Rmg8 Confers Strong Resistance Against Triticum Isolates of Pyricularia oryzae in a Common Wheat Landrace."
"29767554","abstracttext","The wheat blast fungus (Triticum pathotype of Pyricularia oryzae) first arose in Brazil in 1985 and has recently spread to Asia. Resistance genes against this new pathogen are very rare in common wheat populations. We screened 520 local landraces of common wheat collected worldwide with Br48, a Triticum isolate collected in Brazil, and found a highly resistant, unique accession, GR119. When F 2 seedlings derived from a cross between GR119 and Chinese Spring (CS, susceptible control) were inoculated with Br48, resistant and susceptible seedlings segregated in a 15:1 ratio, suggesting that GR119 carries two resistance genes. When the F 2 seedlings were inoculated with Br48ΔA8 carrying a disrupted allele of AVR-Rmg8 (an avirulence gene corresponding to a previously reported resistance gene, Rmg8), however, the segregation fitted a 3:1 ratio. These results suggest that one of the two genes in GR119 was Rmg8. The other, new gene was tentatively designated as RmgGR119. GR119 was highly resistant to all Triticum isolates tested. Spikes of GR119 were highly resistant to Br48, moderately resistant to Br48ΔA8 and a hybrid culture carrying avr-Rmg8 (nonfunctional allele), and highly resistant to its transformant carrying AVR-Rmg8. The strong resistance of GR119 was attributed to the combined effects of Rmg8 and RmgGR119."

As a diploid, it is attractive genetic model for the study of gene structure and function of wheat-specific traits.

However, TILLING offers a powerful functional genetics approach for wheat gene analysis."

The T. monococcum diploid wheat TILLING population had a mutation frequency of 1/90 kb for the same gene. Lignin biosynthesis pathway genes- COMT1, HCT2, and 4CL1 had mutation frequencies of 1/86 kb, 1/92 kb and 1/100 kb, respectively.

"23134614","abstracttext_conclusion","The mutation frequency of a diploid wheat TILLING population was found to be higher than that reported for other diploid grasses. The rate, however, is lower than tetraploid and hexaploid wheat TILLING populations because of the higher tolerance of polyploids to mutations. Unlike polyploid wheat, most mutants in diploid wheat have a phenotype amenable to forward and reverse genetic analysis and establish diploid wheat as an attractive model to study gene function in wheat. We estimate that a TILLING population of 5, 520 will be needed to get a non-sense mutation for every wheat gene of interest with 95% probability."

"11550891","abstracttext","The granule-bound starch (GBSS I, waxy protein) in Triticum timopheevii (AtAtGG) and T. zhukovskyi (AtAtAzAzGG) and a diagnostic section of the genes encoding GBSS-I from the Wx-TtA and Wx-G loci of T. timopheevii and the Wx-TtA, Wx-G, and Wx-TzA loci of T. zhukovskyi were investigated in this study. The waxy proteins in these two polyploid wheats could not be separated into distinct bands, in contrast to those in the T. turgidum (AABB)-T. aestivum (AABBDD) lineage. Alignment of sequences of the section covering exon4-intron4-exon5 of the various waxy genes led to the identification of gene-specific sequences in intron 4. The sequences specific to the Wx-TtA and Wx-G genes of T. timopheevii were different from those of the Wx-A1 gene and Wx-B1 genes of T. turgidum and T. aestivum. A surprising observation was that the Wx-TzA of T. zhukovskyi did not match with the Wx-TmA of T. monococcum, a putative donor of the Az genome, but matched unexpectedly and perfectly with the Wx-B1 gene on chromosome 4A, which is proposed to have translocated from the chromosome 7B of T. aestivum. The possible genetic mechanism explaining these observations is discussed."
"32823887","articletitle","Current Progress in Understanding and Recovering the Wheat Genes Lost in Evolution and Domestication."
"32823887","abstracttext","The modern cultivated wheat has passed a long evolution involving origin of wild emmer (WEM), development of cultivated emmer, formation of spelt wheat and finally establishment of modern bread wheat and durum wheat. During this evolutionary process, rapid alterations and sporadic changes in wheat genome took place, due to hybridization, polyploidization, domestication, and mutation. This has resulted in some modifications and a high level of gene loss. As a result, the modern cultivated wheat does not contain all genes of their progenitors. These lost genes are novel for modern wheat improvement. Exploring wild progenitor for genetic variation of important traits is directly beneficial for wheat breeding. WEM wheat ( Triticum dicoccoides ) is a great genetic resource with huge diversity for traits. Few genes and quantitative trait loci (QTL) for agronomic, quantitative, biotic and abiotic stress-related traits have already been mapped from WEM. This resource can be utilized for modern wheat improvement by integrating identified genes or QTLs through breeding."

"30818659","abstracttext","During the 2000 to 2001 season, 27 stem rust samples were collected from wheat (Triticum aestivum), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and triticale (× Triticosecale) cultivars and lines in the Western Cape, South Africa. Following inoculation and multiplication on McNair 701 seedlings, 40 single pustule isolates of P. graminis f. sp. tritici were established. Twenty-six isolates obtained from wheat, barley, or triticale that produced a similar reaction pattern on a set of differentiating host lines, were designated as pathotype Pgt-2SA55. Pgt-2SA55 is avirulent to Sr5, -6, -7b, -8b, -9b, -9e, -9g, -23, -24, -27, -30, -38, and -Gt, and virulent to Sr11, and -Agi. The remaining 14 isolates, all from wheat and designated as pathotype Pgt-2SA88, were avirulent to Sr24, -27, and -Agi, and virulent to Sr5, -6, -7b, -8b, -9b, -9e, -9g, -11, -23, -30, -38, and -Gt. On an expanded differential set, representative isolates of each pathotype were all avirulent to Sr13, -15, -21, -22, -25, -26, -29, -31, -32, -33, -35, -39, -43, and -Em, and virulent to Sr7a, -8a, -9a, -9d, -9f, -10, -12, -14, -16, -19, -20, -34, and Lc. Pgt-2SA55 was avirulent on cv. Renown (Sr2, -7b, -9d, and -17), whereas Pgt-2SA88 was virulent on this cultivar and Line R Sel carrying only Sr17. Both pathotypes differ from those identified previously in South Africa (1) and to our knowledge, Pgt-2SA88 is the first local isolate to have virulence towards Sr8b and the T. ventricosum-derived gene Sr38. Virulence to Sr38 has been reported in a P. graminis f. sp. tritici isolate collected in Uganda (2). Pathotype Pgt-2SA88 is virulent to seedlings of the previously resistant South African cvs. SST 57 (heterogeneous), Tugela, Tugela DN, and PAN 3377. Furthermore, 20% of the elite breeding lines in the spring and winter wheat breeding program of the Small Grain Institute expressed susceptible seedling reactions to Pgt-2SA88. Triticale cvs. Rex and Kiewiet were heterogeneous in their seedling reaction towards Pgt-2SA55. Seedling and field reactions recorded for the barley cvs. Sterling and SSG 532 and the experimental varieties Puma and Jaguar, showed an increase in stem rust susceptibility to Pgt-2SA55 when compared with existing South African pathotypes. The higher incidence of stem rust in commercial fields and experimental plots of wheat and barley in the Western Cape may be attributed to a recent increase in the cultivation of stem rust-susceptible cultivars in the region. The detection of two new pathotypes of P. graminis f. sp. tritici is of concern to the local small grain industry and requires continued resistance breeding. References: (1) W. H. P. Boshoff et al.

Detailed proteomic analyses of the effects of fertilizer and high temperature on individual gliadin and glutenin protein levels are needed to determine how these environmental factors influence flour quality."
"23432757","abstracttext_results","Wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L. cv. Butte 86) were grown in greenhouses under moderate and high temperature regimens with and without post-anthesis fertilizer. Quantitative two-dimensional gel electrophoresis was used to construct accumulation profiles in developing endosperm for the entire complement of gluten proteins identified previously by tandem mass spectrometry. Amounts of individual gliadins and glutenins were also determined in flour produced under each of the regimens. Under all environmental regimens, most HMW-GS, LMW-GS, γ- and ω-gliadins accumulated rapidly during early stages of grain development and leveled off during middle stages of development. A subset of LMW-GS showed a second distinct profile, accumulating throughout development, while α-gliadins showed a variety of accumulation profiles. In flour, fourteen distinct gluten proteins responded similarly to fertilizer, high temperature, and high temperature plus fertilizer. The majority of HMW-GS and ω-gliadins and some α-gliadins increased while two LMW-GS and a minor γ-gliadin decreased. Fertilizer did not influence gluten protein accumulation under high temperature conditions. Additionally, the effects of fertilizer and high temperature were not additive; very few changes were observed when plants that received fertilizer were subjected to high temperature."
"23432757","abstracttext_conclusions","Although post-anthesis temperature and fertilizer have very different effects on grain development and yield, the two treatments elicit surprisingly similar effects on the accumulation of gluten proteins. The similarity of the responses to the different treatments is likely due to source-sink activities of nitrogen reserves in the wheat plant. Because each protein that showed a response in this study is linked to a gene sequence, the work sets the stage for transgenic studies that will better elucidate the roles of specific proteins in flour quality and in the response to the environment."

"18464820","abstracttext","Alien cytoplasms cause a wide range of phenotypic alterations in the nucleus-cytoplasm (NC) hybrids in the Triticeae. Nuclear genomes of timopheevii wheat (Triticum timopheevii and Triticum araraticum) are fully compatible with the cytoplasm of Aegilops squarrosa, while those of a majority of emmer or durum wheat cultivars and more than half the wild emmer wheats are incompatible, and a maternal 1D chromosome is required to restore seed viability and male fertility in the NC hybrids. A euploid NC hybrid of Triticum durum cv. Langdon with Ae. squarrosa cytoplasm produced by introgressing the NC compatibility (Ncc) gene from T. timopheevii was used to identify random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers linked to it. After a survey of 200 random decamer primers, four markers were selected, all of which were completely linked in 64 individuals of a SB8 mapping population. One marker was derived from a single locus, while three others were from interspersed repetitive sequences. Also, the hybrid chromosomes and those of the parental T. durum had identical C-banding patterns. RAPD-PCR analysis of 65 accessions from wild and cultivated tetraploid wheat species showed the exclusive presence of the markers in timopheevii wheat. In conclusion, the chromosomal region flanking Ncc of T. timopheevii is highly conserved in the genome of this group of tetraploid wheats."

An ENC-plot for 15 SPDS genes from various plant species suggested that mutational bias was the major factor in shaping codon usage in these genes. Codon usage frequency analysis indicated that there was little difference between the CsSPDS gene and dicot genomes, such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum, but significant differences in codon usage were observed between the CsSPDS gene and monocot genomes, such as Triticum aestivum and Zea mays. Therefore, A. thaliana and N. tabacum expression systems may be more suitable for the expression of the CsSPDS gene."

Hybrids carrying either the Ph allele or the ph allele, which differ markedly in metaphase I pairing, are both capable of greater than 90% pachytene pairing, although pairing in the Ph hybrids appeared slower or less synchronised. In both genotypes branched synaptonemal complexes were formed by intra-and interchromosomal pairing. The Ph gene control on homoeologous pairing does not act on the ability to pair into synaptonemal complexes. It may act on the rate of pairing or the time of crossing over."

"12582846","abstracttext","The high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin genes, located on the group 1L chromosome arms, are a major determinant for baking quality in wheat ( Triticum aestivum L.). In addition, the HMW glutenin genes provide a valuable model system for studying the evolution and regulation of orthologous and paralogous genes in polyploid species. The goal of this study was to identify loci that modify the expression of the HMW glutenins, and to map them to specific chromosome arms. Comparisons were made between endosperms with zero versus three (or three versus six) doses for each of the 42 chromosome arms of wheat. SDS-PAGE and scanning densitometry were used to quantify the protein expression levels of the four HMW glutenin genes in cv. Chinese Spring, for each of the dosage comparisons. Fifteen chromosome arms were found to have significant effects on Glu-B1-1, excluding the structural gene dosage effect: eight positive effects on 1AL, 2AS, 2BL, 2DS, 5DS, 6AL, 6DL, and 7AL and seven negative effects on 1BS, 1DS, 1DL, 4DL, 6BS, 6DS, and 7AS. Nineteen chromosome arms had significant effects on Glu-B1-2, excluding the structural gene dosage effect: eight positive effects on 1AL, 2AS, 2BS, 3AL, 4BL, 6DS, 7BL and 7DS and 11 negative effects on 1AS, 1BS, 1DS, 1DL, 2AL, 2BL, 3DS, 4BS, 4DL, 5BL, and 6BS. Twenty chromosome arms had significant effects on Glu-D1-1, excluding the structural gene dosage effect: 11 positive effects on 1AL, 1BL, 2BS, 2DS, 5BS, 5DS, 6AL, 6DS, 6DL, 7AL, and 7BL and nine negative effects on 1AS, 1BS, 1DS, 2BL, 4DL, 5BL, 5DL, 6BL, and 7DS. Twenty-five chromosome arms had significant effects on Glu-D1-2, excluding the structural gene dosage effect: 17 positive effects on 1BL, 2AS, 2BS, 2DS, 2DL, 3AS, 3AL, 3BS, 5AS, 5BS, 5DL, 6AL, 6DL, 7AL, 7BS, 7BL, and 7DL and eight negative effects on 1DS, 4DL, 5AL, 5BL, 6BS, 6BL, 6DS and 7DS. Of the 164 gene-chromosome arm tests performed, about 52% (85/164) showed no significant effects, and 48% (79/164) showed significant effects, excluding the structural gene dosage effects. Of the significant effects, 56% (44/79) were positive effects, and 44% (35/79) were negative effects. Comparisons of dosage effects on orthologous loci (both x-type or both y-type HMW glutenins) showed that orthologous HMW glutenin genes are largely influenced by the same regulatory systems. Less correlation was found for comparisons between paralogous genes, although considerable conservation was observed at this level as well. These observations suggest that after polyploidization, many of the duplicated orthologous regulatory loci were inactivated by mutation, thus consolidating control over the HMW glutenin genes. Possible candidates for orthologous regulatory genes were identified in maize and barley. This study represents the first comprehensive search of the wheat genome for regulators of the HMW glutenins."

"30708548","abstracttext","Leaf rust, caused by Puccinia triticina (Pt), has become a globally important disease for durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) since the detection of race group BBG/BN, which renders ineffective a widely deployed seedling resistance gene present in several popular cultivars including Mexican cultivars Altar C84 and Atil C2000. The resistance gene continues to play a key role in protecting durum wheat against bread wheat-predominant races since virulence among this race group has not been found. We developed F 3 and F 5 mapping populations from a cross between Atil C2000 and the susceptible line Atred #1. Resistance was characterized by greenhouse seedling tests using three Pt races. Segregation tests indicated the presence of a single gene, which was mapped to the distal end of 7BS by bulk segregant analysis. The closest marker, wmc606, was located 5.5 cM proximal to the gene. No known leaf rust resistance genes are reported in this region; this gene was therefore designated as Lr72. The presence of Lr72 was further investigated in greenhouse tests in a collection of durum wheat using 13 Pt races. It was concluded that at least one additional gene protects durum wheat from bread wheat-predominant Pt races."

"29298834","abstracttext","Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon that causes genes to be differentially expressed depending on their parent of origin. To evaluate the evolutionary conservation of genomic imprinting and the effects of ploidy on this process, we investigated parent-of-origin-specific gene expression patterns in the endosperm of diploid ( Aegilops spp), tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat ( Triticum spp) at various stages of development via high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. We identified 91, 135, and 146 maternally or paternally expressed genes (MEGs or PEGs, respectively) in diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat, respectively, 52.7% of which exhibited dynamic expression patterns at different developmental stages. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis suggested that MEGs and PEGs were involved in metabolic processes and DNA-dependent transcription, respectively. Nearly half of the imprinted genes exhibited conserved expression patterns during wheat hexaploidization. In addition, 40% of the homoeolog pairs originating from whole-genome duplication were consistently maternally or paternally biased in the different subgenomes of hexaploid wheat. Furthermore, imprinted expression was found for 41.2% and 50.0% of homolog pairs that evolved by tandem duplication after genome duplication in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, respectively. These results suggest that genomic imprinting was evolutionarily conserved between closely related Triticum and Aegilops species and in the face of polyploid hybridization between species in these genera."

A total of 13 cliques of size 10 were identified, which represent putative functionally equivalent genes and proteins in the 10 plant species. Eighty-five new and more specific GO terms were associated with wheat genes in the 13 cliques of size 10, which represent a 65% increase compared with the previously 130 known GO terms. Similar expression patterns for 4 genes from Arabidopsis, barley, maize and rice in cliques of size 10 provide experimental evidence to support our model. Overall, based on clique size equal or larger than 3, our model enriched the existing gene-GO term associations for 7,838 (8%) wheat genes, of which 2,139 had no previous annotation."

"27173250","abstracttext","Powdery mildew (Pm) is one of the most harmful diseases in wheat. Three Pm-resistance genes, Pm3, Pm21, and Pm8, have been cloned but most Pm3/Pm8 alleles have lost their resistance to Pm in hexaploid wheat. In this study, a new Pm3 homolog gene (TmPm3) was isolated from Triticum monococcum L. using a homology-based cloning strategy, being the first report of a functional Pm3 homolog gene from a diploid wheat species. The transient expression of TmPm3 in leaf epidermal cells showed that over-expressed TmPm3 could significantly inhibit the penetration of Blumeria graminis f. sp tritici conidia spores and the formation of haustoria. Sequence analysis of Pm3 alleles shed new light on the evolution of Pm3 genes, providing a better understanding of the molecular basis of disease resistance. This study also suggested that homology-based cloning of resistance genes is a feasible method for the isolation of functional resistance genes from wheat germplasm."

"25325387","abstracttext","Wheat-specific ribosomal protein L21 (RPL21) is an endogenous reference gene suitable for genetically modified (GM) wheat identification. This taxon-specific RPL21 sequence displayed high homogeneity in different wheat varieties. Southern blots revealed 1 or 3 copies, and sequence analyses showed one amplicon in common wheat. Combined analyses with sequences from common wheat (AABBDD) and three diploid ancestral species, Triticum urartu (AA), Aegilops speltoides (BB), and Aegilops tauschii (DD), demonstrated the presence of this amplicon in the AA genome. Using conventional qualitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the limit of detection was 2 copies of wheat haploid genome per reaction. In the quantitative real-time PCR assay, limits of detection and quantification were about 2 and 8 haploid genome copies, respectively, the latter of which is 2.5-4-fold lower than other reported wheat endogenous reference genes. Construct-specific PCR assays were developed using RPL21 as an endogenous reference gene, and as little as 0.5% of GM wheat contents containing Arabidopsis NPR1 were properly quantified."

"18944243","abstracttext","ABSTRACT To elucidate genetic mechanisms of the species-specific parasitism of Magnaporthe grisea, a Triticum isolate (pathogenic on wheat) was crossed with an Avena isolate (pathogenic on oat), and resulting F(1) progeny were subjected to segregation analyses on wheat cvs. Norin 4 and Chinese Spring. We found two fungal loci, Pwt3 and Pwt4, which are involved in the specific parasitism on wheat. Pwt3 operated on both cultivars while Pwt4 operated only on 'Norin 4'. Using the cultivar specificity of Pwt4, its corresponding resistance gene was successfully identified in 'Norin 4' and designated as Rmg1 (Rwt4). The presence of the corresponding resistance gene indicated that Pwt4 is an avirulence locus. Pwt3 was assumed to be an avirulence locus because of its temperature sensitivity. We suggest that gene-for-gene interactions underlie the species-specific parasitism of M. grisea."

However, to date, no systemic characterization of the trihelix genes has yet been conducted in wheat and its close relatives."
"30975075","abstracttext_results","We identified a total of 94 trihelix genes in wheat, as well as 22 trihelix genes in Triticum urartu, 29 in Aegilops tauschii, and 31 in Brachypodium distachyon. We analyzed the chromosomal locations and orthology relations of the identified trihelix genes, and no trihelix gene was found to be located on chromosome 7A, 7B, or 7D of wheat, thereby reflecting the uneven distributions of wheat trihelix genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the 186 identified trihelix proteins in wheat, rice, B. distachyon, and Arabidopsis were clustered into five major clades. The trihelix genes belonging to the same clades usually shared similar motif compositions and exon/intron structural patterns. Five pairs of tandem duplication genes and three pairs of segmental duplication genes were identified in the wheat trihelix gene family, thereby validating the supposition that more intrachromosomal gene duplication events occur in the genome of wheat than in that of other grass species. The tissue-specific expression and differential expression profiling of the identified genes under cold and drought stresses were analyzed by using RNA-seq data. qRT-PCR was also used to confirm the expression profiles of ten selected wheat trihelix genes under multiple abiotic stresses, and we found that these genes mainly responded to salt and cold stresses."

"19736781","abstracttext","The Russian wheat aphid, Diruaphis noxia (Kudjumov) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), is globally one of the most devastating pests of wheat, Tritium aestivum L., and barley, Hordeum vulgare L. Host plant resistance is the foundation of cereal insect pest management programs, and several D. noxia resistance (Dn) genes from wheat have been introduced in commercial cultivars of wheat to manage Russian wheat aphid (RWA). Emergence of D. noxia biotype 2 (RWA2) in Colorado has made all known Dn genes, except the Dn7 gene from rye, Secale cereale L., vulnerable and has warranted exploration for sources of resistance to RWA1 and RWA2. Here, we report antibiosis resistance to RWA1 and RWA2 identified in the wheat breeding line KS94H871. Additional experiments indicated that tolerance and antixenosis are not operating in KS94H871. Segregation studies involving F2-derived F3 families indicated that KS94H871 resistance to RWA1 is controlled by one dominant gene and one recessive gene, whereas resistance to RWA2 is controlled by only one dominant gene. This new genetic resource may serve as a good source of resistance in future breeding programs with proper understanding of the genetics of resistance."

"18210171","abstracttext","Brachypodium, a wild temperate grass with a small genome, was recently proposed as a new model organism for the large-genome grasses. In this study, we evaluated gene content and microcolinearity between diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum), Brachypodium sylvaticum, and rice at a local genomic region harboring the major wheat domestication gene Q. Gene density was much lower in T. monococcum (one per 41 kb) because of gene duplication and an abundance of transposable elements within intergenic regions as compared to B. sylvaticum (one per 14 kb) and rice (one per 10 kb). For the Q gene region, microcolinearity was more conserved between wheat and rice than between wheat and Brachypodium because B. sylvaticum contained two genes apparently not present within the orthologous regions of T. monococcum and rice. However, phylogenetic analysis of Q and leukotriene A-4 hydrolase-like gene orthologs, which were colinear among the three species, showed that Brachypodium is more closely related to wheat than rice, which agrees with previous studies. We conclude that Brachypodium will be a useful tool for gene discovery, comparative genomics, and the study of evolutionary relationships among the grasses but will not preclude the need to conduct large-scale genomics experiments in the Triticeae."

"17891549","abstracttext","Changes in plant architecture have been central to the domestication of wild species. Tillering or the degree of branching determines shoot architecture and is a key component of grain yield and/or biomass. Previously, a tiller inhibition mutant with monoculm phenotype was isolated and the mutant gene (tin3) was mapped in the distal region of chromosome arm 3AmL of Triticum monococcum. As a first step towards isolating a candidate gene for tin3, the gene was mapped in relation to physically mapped expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and sequence tag site (STS) markers developed based on synteny with rice. In addition, we investigated the relationship of the wheat region containing tin3 with the corresponding region in rice by comparative genomic analysis. Wheat ESTs that had been previously mapped to deletion bins provided a useful framework to identify closely related rice sequences and to establish the most likely syntenous region in rice for the wheat tin3 region. The tin3 gene was mapped to a 324-kb region spanned by two overlapping bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) of rice chromosome arm 1L. Wheat-rice synteny was exceptionally high at the tin3 region despite being located in the high-recombination, gene-rich region of wheat. Identification of tightly linked flanking EST and STS markers to the tin3 gene and its localization to highly syntenic rice BACs will assist in the future development of a high-resolution map and map-based cloning of the tin3 gene."

"29533135","abstracttext","Plants respond in a similar manner to aphid feeding as to pathogen attack. Diuraphis noxia is a specialist aphid, feeding only on selected grasses that include wheat, barley, and oats. The wheat-Diuraphis noxia interaction is characterized by responses very similar to those seen in wheat-pathogen interactions with none of the underlying resistance pathways and genes characterized yet. From wheat harboring the Dn1 resistance gene, we have identified a nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) gene containing two integrated domains (IDs). These are three C-terminus ankyrin repeat domains and an N-terminus WRKY domain. The NLR core of the gene can be traced through speciation events within the grass family, with a recent WRKY domain integration that is Triticum-specific. Virus-induced gene silencing of the gene in a resistant wheat line resulted in the abolishment of the resistance response and induced a highly susceptible phenotype. Silenced plants supported a higher number of aphids, similar to the susceptible near-isogenic line (NIL), and the intrinsic rate of increase of the aphids matched that of aphids feeding on the susceptible NIL. The presence of the gene is necessary for Dn1 resistance and we have named the gene Associated with Dn resistance 1 (Adnr1) to reflect this function."

"29696298","abstracttext_key message","Allotetraploidization drives Glu-1Ay silencing in polyploid wheat. The high-molecular-weight glutenin subunit gene, Glu-1Ay, is always silenced in common wheat via elusive mechanisms. To investigate its silencing and heredity during wheat polyploidization and domestication, the Glu-1Ay gene was characterized in 1246 accessions containing diploid and polyploid wheat worldwide. Eight expressed Glu-1Ay alleles (in 71.81% accessions) and five silenced alleles with a premature termination codon (PTC) were identified in Triticum urartu; 4 expressed alleles (in 41.21% accessions), 13 alleles with PTCs and 1 allele with a WIS 2-1A retrotransposon were present in wild tetraploid wheat; and only silenced alleles with PTC or WIS 2-1A were in cultivated tetra- and hexaploid wheat. Both the PTC number and position in T. urartu Glu-1Ay alleles (one in the N-terminal region) differed from its progeny wild tetraploid wheat (1-5 PTCs mainly in the repetitive domain). The WIS 2-1A insertion occurred ~ 0.13 million years ago in wild tetraploid wheat, much later than the allotetraploidization event. The Glu-1Ay alleles with PTCs or WIS 2-1A that arose in wild tetraploid wheat were fully succeeded to cultivated tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. In addition, the Glu-1Ay gene in wild einkorn inherited to cultivated einkorn. Our data demonstrated that the silencing of Glu-1Ay in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat was attributed to the new PTCs and WIS 2-1A insertion in wild tetraploid wheat, and most silenced alleles were delivered to the cultivated tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, providing a clear evolutionary history of the Glu-1Ay gene in the wheat polyploidization and domestication processes."

"15383071","abstracttext","Cultivated emmer (Triticum dicoccum, 2n = 4x = 28, AABB) is closely related to bread wheat and possesses extensive allelic variations in high molecular weight glutenin subunit (HMW-GS) composition. These alleles may be an important genetic resource for wheat quality improvement. To isolate and clone HMW-GS genes from cultivated emmer, two pairs of allele-specific (AS) PCR primers were designed to amplify the coding sequence of y-type HMW-GS genes and their upstream sequences, respectively. The results showed that single bands of strong amplification were obtained through AS-PCR of genomic DNA from emmer. After cloning and sequencing the complete sequence of coding and 5'-flanking regions of a y-type subunit gene at Glu-A1 locus was obtained. Nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences analysis showed that this gene possessed a similar structure as the previously reported Ay gene from common wheat, and is hence designated as Ay1d. The distinct feature of the Ay1d gene is that its coding region contains four stop codons and its upstream region has a 85-bp deletion in the same position of the Ay gene, which are probably responsible for the silencing of y-type subunit genes at Glu-A1 locus. Phylogenetic analysis of HMW glutenin subunit genes from different Triticum species and genomes were also carried out."

Interestingly, DEP1 homologs are present in the other cereals including species of wheat and barley (Hordeum vulgare), even though they do not produce panicles but spikes. In barley, HvDEP1 alleles do not differ between strains of various ear types and geographic origins, while in at least three OsDEP1 variants have been described."
"29297308","abstracttext_results","In this work, we have studied the DEP1 gene from eight accessions which belong to four wheat species, T. monococcum, T. durum, T. compactum, and T. spelta, with either compact, compactoid or normal spike phenotypes. The nucleotide sequences of the 5th exon of DEP1 were determined for all eight accessions. Obtained sequences were species specific. Despite the interspecies diversity, all wheat sequences encoded polypeptides of the same size, similarly to the 5th exons of the DEP1 homologs in T. aestivum, T. urartu, and H. vulgare. For further study, the full-length sequences of the DEP1 gene for all four species were studied. The full-length DEP1 genomic copies were isolated from the genomic sequences of T. aestivum, T. urartu, and Aegilops tauschii. The genome of tetraploid wheat T. durum contains two variants of the DEP1 originating from A and B genomes. In the hexaploid wheats T. aestivum, T. compactum, and T. spelta, three variants of this gene originating from A, B, and D genomes were detected. DEP1 genes of the diploid wheats T. monococcum and T. urartu differ. It seems that a precursor of the DEP1 gene in T. monococcum originates from the wild progenitor T. boeoticum."
"29297308","abstracttext_conclusion","No DEP1-related differences of nucleotide sequences between the compact (or compactoid) and normal spike phenotypes in the tested wheat species were detected.

Tetraploid wheat species such as emmer wheat and Timopheevi wheat are the oldest cereal crops cultivated in various world areas long before the Christian era. Nowadays, these hulled wheat species are gaining new interest as donors for gene pools responsible for the improved grain yield and quality, tolerance for abiotic and biotic stress, resistance to pests and disease. The establishing of efficient gene transfer techniques for emmer and Timopheevi wheat may help in creation of modern polyploid wheat varieties."

'Runo') using a biolistic delivery of a plasmid encoding the gene of green fluorescent protein (GFP) and an herbicide resistance gene (BAR). Both the origin of target tissues (mature or immature embryos) and the type of morphogenic calli (white or translucent) influenced the efficiency of stable transgenic plant production in emmer wheat. The bombardment of nodular white compact calluses is a major factor allowed to achieve the highest transformation efficiency of emmer wheat (on average, 12.9%) confirmed by fluorescence, PCR, and Southern blot. In the absence of donor plants for isolation of immature embryos, mature embryo-derived calluses could be used as alternative tissues for recovering transgenic emmer plants with a frequency of 2.1%. The biolistic procedure based on the bombardment of immature embryo-derived calluses was also successful for the generation of transgenic Triticum timopheevii wheat plants (transformation efficiency of 0.5%). Most of the primary events transmitted the transgene expression to the sexual progeny."

Both TaACA and TaECA group proteins consisted of eight to ten transmembrane regions, and their respective domains and motifs. Prediction of sub-cellular localization was found variable for most of the proteins; moreover, it was consistent with the evolutionarily related proteins from rice and Arabidopsis in certain cases. The occurrence of assorted sets of cis-regulatory elements indicated their diverse functions. The differential expression of various TaACA and TaECA genes during developmental stages suggested their roles in growth and development. The modulated expression during heat, drought, salt and biotic stresses along with the occurrence of various stress specific cis-regulatory elements suggested their association with stress response. Interaction of these genes with numerous development and stress related genes indicated their decisive role in various biological processes and signaling."

Although many primer pairs were used, two pairs of orf256 specific primers (5:-94/C: 482, 5:253/C: 482), amplified DNA fragments of 576 bp and 230 bp respectively in all species were tested. A common 500 bp of nine species of Triticum and Aegilops were aligned and showed consistent results with that obtained from other similar chloroplast or nuclear genes. Base alignment showed that there were various numbers of base substitutions in all species compared to S. cereal (Sc) (the outgroup species). Phylogenetic relationship revealed similar locations and proximity on phylogenetic trees established using plastid and nuclear genes.

Further homoeologous loci exist in Triticum durum, Triticum tauschii, and most probably in Secale cereale and Hordeum vulgare. By analyzing a syntheticxcultivated wheat cross (ITMI mapping population) under different environmental conditions it was shown that the expression of the genes determining anthocyanin pigmentation of the coleoptiles varies. One additional locus was detected on chromosome 4BL. Beside the mapping data, results of a screening for red coleoptile color genes in 468 mainly European wheat varieties are presented."

In hybrids of T. aestivum (normal, ditelosomic 3DL or ditelosomic 3DL-monosomic 5D) x T. longissimum (= Ae. sharonensis), this compensation was not observed.In normal F1 hybrids of T. durum x T. longissimum partial chromosome association occurred at 10°C and this stabilizer effect may be explained by the presence of a Ltp-like gene on chromosome 5A. When a line of T. durum carrying a homozygous translocated 5B-5D chromosome was used in the crosses an even higher chromosome association was observed.These results suggest either the existence of a promoter gene for chromosome association in the 5D translocated segment or the loss of a weak suppressor gene in the removed segment of 5B.

Results show that proteins in T. aestivum are significantly more disordered than those of H. vulgare. Moreover, the data revealed that DNA/RNA binding domains, co-factors, heme, metal ions binding domains, ATP/GTP binding proteins, ligands, linker domains and repeats, other domains typical to transcription factors such as zinc finger, F-box domain, homeodomain-like, l-domain like and chaperones, are predominantly present and co-occur in disordered proteins in T.aestivum and H.vulgare.

Identifying genetic modifications underlying wheat's domestication requires knowledge about the genome of its allo-tetraploid progenitor, wild emmer ( T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides ). We report a 10.1-gigabase assembly of the 14 chromosomes of wild tetraploid wheat, as well as analyses of gene content, genome architecture, and genetic diversity. With this fully assembled polyploid wheat genome, we identified the causal mutations in Brittle Rachis 1 ( TtBtr1 ) genes controlling shattering, a key domestication trait. A study of genomic diversity among wild and domesticated accessions revealed genomic regions bearing the signature of selection under domestication. This reference assembly will serve as a resource for accelerating the genome-assisted improvement of modern wheat varieties."

"30733728","abstracttext","The genus Aegilops contains a diverse collection of wild species exhibiting variation in geographical distribution, ecological adaptation, ploidy and genome organization. Aegilops is the most closely related genus to Triticum which includes cultivated wheat, a globally important crop that has a limited gene pool for modern breeding. Aegilops species are a potential future resource for wheat breeding for traits, such as adaptation to different ecological conditions and pest and disease resistance. This study describes the development and application of the first high-throughput genotyping platform specifically designed for screening wheat relative species. The platform was used to screen multiple accessions representing all species in the genus Aegilops . Firstly, the data was demonstrated to be useful for screening diversity and examining relationships within and between Aegilops species. Secondly, markers able to characterize and track introgressions from Aegilops species in hexaploid wheat were identified and validated using two different approaches."

"24203049","abstracttext","We demonstrate that the scores and frequencies of chlortoluron (CT) and metoxuron (MX) resistance and susceptible phenotypes of wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, are correlated with ecological factors and allozyme markers. Some isozyme markers located on chromosome 6B (e.g. Adh,Est-4 and Got), which also harbours the CT and MX resistance gene, provide good genetic markers for herbicide resistance breeding. Significant correlations between herbicide and photosynthetic characters suggest that the evolution of herbicide resistance polymorphisms may be related to the process of photosynthesis in nature and predated domestication of cultivated wheat."
"32399658","articletitle","Genome-Wide Identification and Analysis of the Growth-Regulating Factor (GRF) Gene Family and GRF-Interacting Factor Family in Triticum aestivum L."
"32399658","abstracttext","Growth-regulating factors (GRFs) are unique transcription factors in plants. GRFs can interact with SNH (SYT N-terminal homology) domains in GRF-interacting factor (GIF) proteins via the N-terminal QLQ (Gln, Leu, Gln) domain to form functional complexes and participate in the regulation of downstream gene expression. In this study, we systematically identified the GRF gene family and GIF gene family in wheat and its relatives comprising Triticum urartu, Triticum dicoccoides, and Aegilops tauschii. Thirty GRF gene members are present in wheat, which are distributed on 12 chromosomes and they have 2-5 protein-coding regions. They all contain QLQ and WRC (Trp, Arg, Cys) conserved domains. Wheat possesses only eight members of the GIF gene family, which are distributed on six chromosomes. All wheat GIF (TaGIF) proteins have highly conserved SNH and QG (Gln, Gly) domains. The wheat GRF (TaGRF) gene family has 13 pairs of segmental duplication genes and no tandem duplication genes; the TaGIF gene family has two pairs of segmental duplication genes and no tandem duplication genes. It is speculated that segmental duplication events may be the main reason for the amplification of TaGRF gene family and TaGIF gene family. Based on published transcriptome data and qRT-PCR results of 8 TaGRF genes and 4 TaGIF genes, all of the genes responded strongly to osmotic stress, and the expression levels of TaGRF21 and TaGIF5 were also significantly upregulated under drought and cold stress conditions. The results obtained in this study may facilitate further investigations of the functions of TaGRF genes and TaGIF genes in order to identify candidate genes for use in stress-resistant wheat breeding programs."
"18943793","articletitle","Genetic and Physical Mapping of a Gene Conditioning Sensitivity in Wheat to a Partially Purified Host-Selective Toxin Produced by Stagonospora nodorum."
"18943793","abstracttext","ABSTRACT A toxin, designated SnTox1, was partially purified from culture filtrates of isolate Sn2000 of Stagonospora nodorum, the causal agent of wheat leaf and glume blotch. The toxin showed selective action on several different wheat genotypes, indicating that it is a host-selective toxin (HST). The toxic activity was reduced when incubated at 50 degrees C and activity was eliminated when treated with proteinase K, suggesting that the HST is a protein. The synthetic hexaploid wheat W-7984 and hard red spring wheat Opata 85, the parents of the International Triticeae Mapping Initiative (ITMI) mapping population, were found to be sensitive and insensitive, respectively, to SnTox1. The ITMI mapping population was evaluated for toxin reaction and used to map the gene conditioning sensitivity. This gene, designated Snn1, mapped to the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 1B. The wheat cv. Chinese Spring (CS) and all CS nullisomic-tetrasomic lines were sensitive to the toxin, with the exception of N1BT1D. Insensitivity also was observed when the 1B chromosome of CS was substituted with the 1B chromosome of an insensitive accession of Triticum dicoccoides. In addition, a series of 1BS chromosome deletion lines were used to physically localize the sensitivity gene. Physical mapping indicated that Snn1 lies within a major gene-rich region on 1BS. This is the first report identifying a putative proteinaceous HST from S. nodorum and the chromosomal location of a host gene conferring sensitivity."
"29614079","articletitle","Identification and characterization of wheat stem rust resistance gene Sr21 effective against the Ug99 race group at high temperature."
"29614079","abstracttext","Wheat stem rust, caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici (Pgt), is a devastating foliar disease. The Ug99 race group has combined virulence to most stem rust (Sr) resistance genes deployed in wheat and is a threat to global wheat production. Here we identified a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein (NLR) completely linked to the Ug99 resistance gene Sr21 from Triticum monococcum. Loss-of-function mutations and transgenic complementation confirmed that this gene is Sr21. Sr21 transcripts were significantly higher at high temperatures, and this was associated with significant upregulation of pathogenesis related (PR) genes and increased levels of resistance at those temperatures. Introgression of Sr21 into hexaploid wheat resulted in lower levels of resistance than in diploid wheat, but transgenic hexaploid wheat lines with high levels of Sr21 expression showed high levels of resistance. Sr21 can be a valuable component of transgenic cassettes or gene pyramids combining multiple resistance genes against Ug99."
"33239791","articletitle","Multiple wheat genomes reveal global variation in modern breeding."
"33239791","abstracttext","Advances in genomics have expedited the improvement of several agriculturally important crops but similar efforts in wheat (Triticum spp.) have been more challenging. This is largely owing to the size and complexity of the wheat genome 1 , and the lack of genome-assembly data for multiple wheat lines 2,3 . Here we generated ten chromosome pseudomolecule and five scaffold assemblies of hexaploid wheat to explore the genomic diversity among wheat lines from global breeding programs. Comparative analysis revealed extensive structural rearrangements, introgressions from wild relatives and differences in gene content resulting from complex breeding histories aimed at improving adaptation to diverse environments, grain yield and quality, and resistance to stresses 4,5 . We provide examples outlining the utility of these genomes, including a detailed multi-genome-derived nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat protein repertoire involved in disease resistance and the characterization of Sm1 6 , a gene associated with insect resistance. These genome assemblies will provide a basis for functional gene discovery and breeding to deliver the next generation of modern wheat cultivars."
"12416613","articletitle","Chromosome landing near avirulence gene vH13 in the Hessian fly."
"12416613","abstracttext","AFLP markers in linkage disequilibrium with vH13, an avirulence gene in the Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) that conditions avirulence to resistance gene H13 in wheat (Triticum spp.), were discovered by bulked segregant analysis. Five AFLPs were converted into codominant site-specific markers that genetically mapped within 13 cM of this gene. Flanking markers used as probes positioned vH13 near the telomere of the short arm of Hessian fly chromosome X2. These results suggest that the X-linked avirulence genes vH6, vH9, and vH13 are present on Hessian fly chromosome X2 rather than on chromosome X1 as reported previously. Genetic complementation demonstrated that recessive alleles of vH13 were responsible for the H13-virulence observed in populations derived from four different states in the U.S.A.: Georgia, Maryland, Virginia, and Washington. Results support the hypothesis that a gene-for-gene interaction exists between wheat and Hessian fly."
"15338132","articletitle","A cytogenetic method for stacking gene pairs in common wheat."
"15338132","abstracttext","The potential for non-reciprocal Robertsonian translocations of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to assist in the stacking of genes was assessed from a study of their cytological and genetic behaviour. To obtain translocations, a double monosomic (3B+5A; 2n=40=19ii+2i) was crossed reciprocally with a contrasting disomic. Individuals inheriting a broken monosome were identified from the loss of one arm-specific DNA marker coupled with retention of a marker for the opposite arm. No double breaks (potential translocations) were found in 180 cross progeny recovered from pollen of the double monosomic but two instances (loss of 5AL plus 3BS; loss of 5AL plus 3BL) were found in 251 progeny recovered from ovules. Meiotic pairing and multi-color genome-specific fluorescence in situ hybridization (mcGISH) showed that each plant with a double break contained one translocated chromosome between the A and B genomes that had rejoined at the centromere and that formed a trivalent (19ii+ liii) in about 83% of PMC. Most trivalents (approximately 92%) aligned at metaphase in a 'V' configuration(alternate disjunction) while the rest aligned in linear 'I'(adjacent disjunction) or ambiguous 'L' configurations. Genetic analysis of a testcross of these 'fusion monosomics' showed that this preferential co-orientation of the trivalent influenced the assortment of the chromosome arms involved. Loci that were located in the hemizygous ends of the 'V' trivalent showed strong quasi-linkage in that most ovules from the female testcross carried relevant DNA markers either from both standard chromosomes or from neither. This shows that, in most cases, the two standard chromosomes assorted to the same pole while the fused monosome segregated to the opposite pole. For heterozygous loci (present both on the fusion monosome and the standard chromosomes) assortment was either independent or showed partial linkage to the hemizygous arm depending on the reported recombination distance from centromere. Marker assortment was further distorted in male testcrosses and in doubled haploids (made from the fusion monosomics by the maize method) by the strong selective advantage of pollen or haploids that inherited the standard chromosomes rather than the deficiencies. This genetic data shows that under the combined influence of alternate disjunction and natural selection, progeny of fusion monosomics will revert to the standard disomic arrangement, fixing the gene content of both hemizygous arms in the process. Thus, any pair of genes could be targeted for joint fixation by isolating the fusion monosome that will link them temporarily in a segregating population."
"30727185","articletitle","First Report of Cylindrocladiella parva and C. peruviana Associated with Black-foot Disease of Grapevine in Spain."
"30727185","abstracttext","From 2007 to 2009, Cylindrocladiella-like isolates were recovered from grapevine (Vitis vinifera L.) roots with symptoms of black-foot disease in Spain, where the causal agents of this disease have been previously reported as Campylocarpon and Cylindrocarpon species (1,2). Three representative isolates were selected to confirm their identity: CPa1 and CPa2 from Asturias (northern Spain), and CPe523 from Cuenca (central Spain). Isolates were incubated on malt extract agar (MEA) and Spezieller Nährstoffarmer Agar (SNA) with carnation leaves (4) at 25°C for 10 days in darkness. On MEA, colonies developed light brown, cottony mycelium. On SNA, all three isolates produced chlamydospores in chains, and conidia were zero-to one-septate, but CPa1 and CPa2 produced longer conidia (10.4 to 18.9 [15.3] × 1.7 to 3.1 [2.4] μm) than CPe523 (6.4 to 12.3 [9.7] × 1.6 to 3.3 [2.4] μm). A fragment of the beta-tubulin gene from all isolates was sequenced with primers T1 and Bt2b (1) and deposited in GenBank (Accession Nos. JQ693133, JQ693134, and JQ693135). CPa1 and CPa2 showed high similarity (99%) to Cylindrocladiella parva (AY793486) and CPe523 showed high similarity (99%) to C. peruviana (AY793500), which is in agreement with the corresponding morphological features of these species (4). Pathogenicity tests were conducted with inoculum produced on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seed soaked for 12 h in 300 ml of distilled water and autoclaved three times. Inoculum was prepared by inoculating two fungal disks (8 mm in diameter) of a 2-week-old culture of each isolate grown on potato dextrose agar to wheat seed and incubation at 25°C for 4 weeks. One-month-old grapevine seedlings were planted individually in 220-cc pots filled with a potting medium of sterilized peat moss and 10 g of inoculum, and grown in the greenhouse at 25°C in a completely randomized design. Controls were inoculated with sterile, noninoculated wheat seed. There were six replicate plants per isolate, with an equal number of controls, and the experiment was repeated once. Symptoms developed in all plants by 20 days post-inoculation and consisted of reduced vigor, necrotic root lesions, and occasionally mortality, all of which resembled the symptoms from grapevines in the field from which the isolates were originally recovered. Mean shoot dry weights of inoculated plants (0.25, 0.16, and 0.28 g for CPa1, Cpa2, and CPa523, respectively) were significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the controls (0.74 g). Mean root dry weights of inoculated plants (0.28, 0.16, and 0.29 g for CPa1, Cpa2, and CPa523, respectively) were also significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the controls (0.68 g). Isolates recovered from the roots of inoculated plants were identical morphologically and molecularly to C. parva and C. peruviana, thereby satisfying Koch's postulates. No symptoms were observed on the control plants. These Cylindrocladiella spp. have been reported from nurseries or vineyards in South Africa and New Zealand (3). To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. parva and C. peruviana associated with black-foot disease of grapevine in Spain, and in Europe. References: (1) S. Alaniz et al.

"30731966","articletitle","First Report of a New Wheat Leaf Rust (Puccinia triticina) Race with Virulence for Lr12, 13, and 37 in South Africa."
"30731966","abstracttext","A new race of Puccinia triticina was collected from common wheat (Triticum aestivum) in the Eastern and Western Cape provinces during the annual rust survey in 2009. Six single-pustule isolates from a field collection, which were shown to be a new race in preliminary analyses, were inoculated onto seedlings of 16 Thatcher (Tc) near-isogenic differential lines (1) and other tester lines with known Lr genes. Standard procedures for inoculation, incubation, and rust evaluation were followed (4) and all infection studies were repeated. The low infection type of Lr18 was confirmed at 18°C. All six isolates were avirulent (infection types [ITs] 0; to 2) to Lr1, 2a, 2c, 9, 11, 16, 18, and 24 and virulent (ITs 3 to 4) to Lr3, 3ka, 10, 14a, 17, 26, 30, B, and Tc (control). The new race, named 3SA145 according to the ARC-Small Grain Institute notation, corresponds to race CCPS in the North American system (1). On the basis of seedling ITs of the extended Lr gene set, 3SA145 was avirulent (ITs 0; to 22+) to Lr2b, 19, 21, 23, 25, 28, 29, 32, 36 (E84081), 38, 45, 47 (KS90H450), 50 (KS96WGRC36), 51 (R05), and 52 and virulent to Lr3bg, 15, 20 (Thew), 27+31 (Gatcher), and 33. Lines containing the adult plant resistance (APR) genes Lr12 (RL6011, IT 3++), Lr13 (CT263, IT 3), Lr22b (Tc, IT 4), and Lr37 (RL6081, IT 3) were susceptible in the adult stage to 3SA145, whereas lines with the APR genes Lr22a (RL6044, IT ;1), Lr34 (RL6058, IT Z1), and Lr35 (RL6082, IT ;1) were resistant in controlled infection studies in a greenhouse. A control, the common race (3SA133), was virulent only on Tc adult plants. In seedlings, 3SA133 was avirulent to Lr15, 17, 26, and 27+31, but unlike 3SA145, it was virulent to Lr1, 2c, 11, 18, 24, and 28. Races 3SA133 and 3SA145 did not differ in their virulence to the remaining seedling genes. Virulence to Lr37 has been reported in several countries, including Australia, Canada, Uruguay, and the United States (1,2). Prior to the detection of 3SA145, adult plants of RL6081 were resistant to all wheat leaf rust races in South Africa. In 2009, however, RL6081 showed severity levels of up to 30S at certain Western Cape trap plot sites. Of 124 South African bread wheat cultivars and advanced breeding lines tested at the seedling stage, 3SA145 was virulent to 48, whereas 3SA133 was virulent to 36 entries. A further six entries were heterogeneous in their reaction to 3SA145. In adult plant infection studies of 48 South African spring wheats in a greenhouse, 19 were susceptible (flag leaf IT ≥3) and 22 were resistant to 3SA145. Seven entries showed a Z3 flag leaf IT indicating adult plant resistance. According to a simple sequence repeat (SSR) study using 17 primer-pair combinations described by Szabo and Kolmer (3), 3SA145 showed 30% homology with the dominant South African races. Although virulence to Lr12 and Lr13 has been known in different leaf rust races in South Africa, to our knowledge, this is the first report of combined virulence to Lr12, 13, and 37. The SSR data and unique avirulence/virulence profile suggest that 3SA145 may be an exotic introduction to South Africa. References: (1) J. A. Kolmer et al. Plant Dis. 89:1201, 2005. (2) B.

"30708857","articletitle","First Report of Puccinia triticina (Leaf Rust) Race FBPT on Wheat in South Africa."
"30708857","abstracttext","Eleven isolates of Puccinia triticina Erikss. collected from bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in the Western Cape during the 2010 annual rust survey were pathotyped to a race not previously recorded in South Africa. Replicated race analysis on seedlings of 16 Thatcher (Tc) near-isogenic differential lines at two rust laboratories confirmed avirulence (infection types [ITs] 0; to 2+) for lines with Lr1, Lr2a, Lr9, Lr11, Lr16, Lr24, and Lr26 and virulence (ITs 3 to 4) for lines with Lr2c, Lr3, Lr3ka, Lr10, Lr14a, Lr17, Lr18, Lr30, and LrB. Thatcher lines with LrB, Lr10, Lr14a, and Lr18 were added as the fourth set to the 12 original differential lines (1,2). This profile codes to race FBPT according to the North American system, and, based on these differentials, resembles a P. triticina isolate from Gwebi, Zimbabwe, in 2012 (Z. A. Pretorius, unpublished data). When additional single gene lines were tested with FBPT (race 3SA147 according to the ARC-Small Grain Institute rust notation procedure), lines with Lr2b, Lr15, Lr19, Lr20, Lr21, Lr25, Lr27+31, Lr28, Lr29, Lr32, Lr36, Lr38, Lr45, Lr47, Lr50, Lr51, and Lr52 were effective, whereas lines with Lr3bg, Lr23, Lr28, and Lr33 were ineffective. In adult plant tests in a greenhouse, Thatcher lines containing Lr12 (IT ;1c), Lr13 (IT ;1c), Lr22a (IT 1), Lr35 (IT ;1+), and Lr37 (IT ;1) were resistant, whereas Thatcher (Lr22b) was susceptible. Of 146 South African cultivars and lines infected as seedlings with 3SA147 (FBPT), 83% were resistant (IT ≤ 2) and 5% showed within-line variation. Entries showing compatible ITs with 3SA147 (FBPT) were also susceptible to either or both of 3SA133 (PDRS) and 3SA146 (MCDS). In addition, the new race was genotyped using 16 simple sequence repeat (SSR) primer-combinations (3). Three single pustule isolates of 3SA147 (FBPT) were identical and showed 82% and 76% similarity with the recently described races 3SA146 (MCDS) and 3SA145 (CCPS), respectively (4). Minimum spanning network analysis confirmed this close genetic relationship among the three races. However, since their virulence phenotypes differ, it is proposed that 3SA147 (FBPT) is not a stepwise mutation from either 3SA145 (CCPS) or 3SA146 (MCDS), but rather a foreign introduction into South Africa. As most current breeding lines and wheat cultivars are resistant, it is unlikely that race FBPT will threaten wheat production in South Africa, but its detection underlines the fact that new P. triticina variants have been occurring at regular intervals in the region.

"16432738","articletitle","A microcolinearity study at the earliness per se gene Eps-A(m)1 region reveals an ancient duplication that preceded the wheat-rice divergence."
"16432738","abstracttext","Wheat flowering is controlled by numerous genes, which respond to environmental signals such as photoperiod and vernalization. Earliness per se (Eps) genes control flowering time independently of these environmental cues and are responsible for the fine tuning of flowering time. We recently mapped the Eps-A(m)1 gene on the end of Triticum monococcum chromosome arm 1A(m)L. As a part of our efforts to clone Eps-A(m)1 we developed PCR markers flanking this gene within a 2.7 cM interval. We screened more than one thousand gametes with these markers and identified 27 lines with recombination between them. Recombinant lines were used to generate a high-density map and to investigate the microcolinearity between wheat and rice in this region. We mapped ten genes from a 149 kb region located at the distal part of rice chromosome 5 (cdo393 - Ndk3) on a 3.7 cM region on wheat chromosome one. This region is part of an ancient duplication between rice chromosomes 5 and 1. Genes present in both rice chromosomes were less similar to each other than to the closest wheat orthologues, suggesting that this duplication preceded the divergence between wheat and rice. This hypothesis was supported by the presence of 18 loci duplicated both in rice chromosomes 5 and 1 and in the colinear wheat chromosomes from homologous groups 1 and 3. Independent gene deletions in wheat and rice lineages explain the alternations of colinearity between rice chromosome 5 and wheat chromosomes 1 and 3. Colinearity between the end of rice chromosome 5 and wheat chromosome 1 was also interrupted by a small inversion, and several non-colinear genes. These results suggest that the distal region of the long arm of wheat chromosome 1 was involved in numerous changes that differentiated wheat and rice genomes. This comparative study provided sufficient markers to saturate the Eps-A(m)1 gene region and to precisely map this gene within a 0.9 cM interval flanked by the VatpC and Smp loci."
"17565482","articletitle","An integrated molecular linkage map of diploid wheat based on a Triticum boeoticum x T. monococcum RIL population."
"17565482","abstracttext","Diploid A genome species of wheat harbour immense variability for biotic stresses and productivity traits, and these could be transferred efficiently to hexaploid wheat through marker assisted selection, provided the target genes are tagged at diploid level first. Here we report an integrated molecular linkage map of A genome diploid wheat based on 93 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Triticum boeoticum x Triticum monococcum inter sub-specific cross. The parental lines were analysed with 306 simple sequence repeat (SSR) and 194 RFLP markers, including 66 bin mapped ESTs. Out of 306 SSRs tested for polymorphism, 74 (24.2%) did not show amplification (null) in both the parents. Overall, 171 (73.7%) of the 232 remaining SSR and 98 (50.5%) of the 194 RFLP markers were polymorphic. Both A and D genome specific SSR markers showed similar transferability to A genome of diploid wheat species. The 176 polymorphic markers, that were assayed on a set of 93 RILs, yielded 188 polymorphic loci and 177 of these as well as two additional morphological traits mapped on seven linkage groups with a total map length of 1,262 cM, which is longer than most of the available A genome linkage maps in diploid and hexaploid wheat. About 58 loci showed distorted segregation with majority of these mapping on chromosome 2A(m). With a few exceptions, the position and order of the markers was similar to the ones in other maps of the wheat A genome. Chromosome 1A(m) of T. monococcum and T. boeoticum showed a small paracentric inversion relative to the A genome of hexaploid wheat. The described linkage map could be useful for gene tagging, marker assisted gene introgression from diploid into hexaploid wheat as well as for map based cloning of genes from diploid A genome species and orthologous genes from hexaploid wheat."
"12724543","articletitle","Rapid genome divergence at orthologous low molecular weight glutenin loci of the A and Am genomes of wheat."
"12724543","abstracttext","To study genome evolution in wheat, we have sequenced and compared two large physical contigs of 285 and 142 kb covering orthologous low molecular weight (LMW) glutenin loci on chromosome 1AS of a diploid wheat species (Triticum monococcum subsp monococcum) and a tetraploid wheat species (Triticum turgidum subsp durum). Sequence conservation between the two species was restricted to small regions containing the orthologous LMW glutenin genes, whereas >90% of the compared sequences were not conserved. Dramatic sequence rearrangements occurred in the regions rich in repetitive elements. Dating of long terminal repeat retrotransposon insertions revealed different insertion events occurring during the last 5.5 million years in both species. These insertions are partially responsible for the lack of homology between the intergenic regions. In addition, the gene space was conserved only partially, because different predicted genes were identified on both contigs. Duplications and deletions of large fragments that might be attributable to illegitimate recombination also have contributed to the differentiation of this region in both species. The striking differences in the intergenic landscape between the A and A(m) genomes that diverged 1 to 3 million years ago provide evidence for a dynamic and rapid genome evolution in wheat species."
"15448900","articletitle","Durum wheat as a candidate for the unknown female progenitor of bread wheat: an empirical study with a highly fertile F1 hybrid with Aegilops tauschii Coss."
"15448900","abstracttext","Hexaploid bread wheat was derived from a hybrid cross between a cultivated form of tetraploid Triticum wheat (female progenitor) and a wild diploid species, Aegilops tauschii Coss. (male progenitor). This cross produced a fertile triploid F1 hybrid that set hexaploid seeds. The identity of the female progenitor is unknown, but various cultivated tetraploid Triticum wheats exist today. Genetic and archaeological evidence suggests that durum wheat ( T. turgidum ssp. durum) may be the female progenitor. In previous studies, however, F1 hybrids of durum wheat crossed with Ae. tauschii consistently had low levels of fertility. To establish an empirical basis for the theory of durum wheat being the female progenitor of bread wheat, we crossed a durum wheat cultivar that carries a gene for meiotic restitution with a line of Ae. tauschii. F1 hybrids were produced without using embryo rescue techniques. These triploid F1 hybrids were highly fertile and spontaneously set hexaploid F2 seeds at the average selfed seedset rate of 51.5%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of the production of highly fertile F1 hybrids between durum wheat and Ae. tauschii. The F1 and F2 hybrids are both similar morphologically to bread wheat and have vigorous growth habits. Cytological analyses of F1 male gametogenesis showed that meiotic restitution is responsible for the high fertility of the triploid F1 hybrids.

"23449073","abstracttext","In order to establish a specific identification method for genetically modified (GM) wheat, exogenous insert DNA and flanking sequence between exogenous fragment and recombinant chromosome of GM wheat B73-6-1 were successfully acquired by means of conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and thermal asymmetric interlaced (TAIL)-PCR strategies. Newly acquired exogenous fragment covered the full-length sequence of transformed genes such as transformed plasmid and corresponding functional genes including marker uidA, herbicide-resistant bar, ubiquitin promoter, and high-molecular-weight gluten subunit. The flanking sequence between insert DNA revealed high similarity with Triticum turgidum A gene (GenBank: AY494981.1). A specific PCR detection method for GM wheat B73-6-1 was established on the basis of primers designed according to the flanking sequence. This specific PCR method was validated by GM wheat, GM corn, GM soybean, GM rice, and non-GM wheat. The specifically amplified target band was observed only in GM wheat B73-6-1. This method is of high specificity, high reproducibility, rapid identification, and excellent accuracy for the identification of GM wheat B73-6-1."

"29281751","abstracttext","Powdery mildew is one of the most devastating diseases of wheat. To date, few powdery mildew resistance genes have been cloned from wheat due to the size and complexity of the wheat genome. Triticum urartu is the progenitor of the A genome of wheat and is an important source for powdery mildew resistance genes. Using molecular markers designed from scaffolds of the sequenced T. urartu accession and standard map-based cloning, a powdery mildew resistance locus was mapped to a 356-kb region, which contains two nucleotide-binding and leucine-rich repeat domain (NB-LRR) protein-encoding genes. Virus-induced gene silencing, single-cell transient expression, and stable transformation assays demonstrated that one of these two genes, designated Pm60, confers resistance to powdery mildew. Overexpression of full-length Pm60 and two allelic variants in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves induced hypersensitive cell death response, but expression of the coiled-coil domain alone was insufficient to induce hypersensitive response. Yeast two-hybrid, bimolecular fluorescence complementation and luciferase complementation imaging assays showed that Pm60 protein interacts with its neighboring NB-containing protein, suggesting that they might be functionally related. The identification and cloning of this novel wheat powdery mildew resistance gene will facilitate breeding for disease resistance in wheat."

"32602899","abstracttext","The Triticum/Aegilops complex includes hybrid species resulting from HHS (homoploid hybrid speciation) and AS (allopolyploid speciation). Sequential allotetra- and allohexaploidy events presumably result in two challenges for the hybrids, which involve (i) cytonuclear stoichiometric disruptions caused by combining two diverged nuclear genomes with the maternal inheritance of the cytoplasmic organellar donor; and (ii) incompatibility of chimeric protein complexes with diverged subunits from nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes. Here, we describe co-evolution of nuclear rbcS genes encoding the small subunits of Rubisco (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase) and nuclear genes encoding plastid translocons, which mediate recognition and translocation of nuclear-encoded proteins into plastids, in allopolyploid wheat species. We demonstrate that intergenomic paternal-to-maternal gene conversion specifically occurred in the genic region of the homoeologous rbcS3 gene from the D genome progenitor of wheat (abbreviated as rbcS3D) such that it encodes a maternal-like or B-subgenome-like SSU3D transit peptide in allohexaploid wheat but not in allotetraploid wheat. Divergent and limited interaction between SSU3D and the D-subgenomic TOC90D translocon subunit is implicated to underpin SSU3D targeting into the chloroplast of hexaploid wheat. This implicates early selection favoring individuals harboring optimal maternal-like organellar SSU3D targeting in hexaploid wheat. These data represent a novel dimension of cytonuclear evolution mediated by organellar targeting and transportation of nuclear proteins."

"32583535","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, a fungal disease caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt), has a serious impact on wheat production. Loss of resistance in cultivars prompts a continuing search for new sources of resistance. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, WEW), the progenitor of both modern tetraploid and hexaploid wheats, harbors many powdery mildew resistance genes. We report here the positional cloning and functional characterization of Pm41, a powdery mildew resistance gene derived from WEW, which encodes a coiled-coil, nucleotide-binding site and leucine-rich repeat protein (CNL). Mutagenesis and stable genetic transformation confirmed the function of Pm41 against Bgt infection in wheat. We demonstrated that Pm41 was present at a very low frequency (1.81%) only in southern WEW populations. It was absent in other WEW populations, domesticated emmer, durum, and common wheat, suggesting that the ancestral Pm41 was restricted to its place of origin and was not incorporated into domesticated wheat. Our findings emphasize the importance of conservation and exploitation of the primary WEW gene pool, as a valuable resource for discovery of resistance genes for improvement of modern wheat cultivars."

"10707359","abstracttext","A resistance (R) gene-rich 2S chromosomal segment from Triticum ventricosum contains a cereal cyst nematode (CCN; Heterodera avenae) R gene locus CreX and a closely linked group of genes (Sr38, Yr17, and Lr37) that confer resistance to stem rust (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici), stripe rust (P. striiformis f. sp. tritici), and leaf rust (P. recondita f. sp. tritici) when introgressed into wheat. The 2S chromosomal segment from T. ventricosum is further delineated in translocations onto chromosome 2A of bread wheat, where the rust genes are retained but not the CreX gene. Using these critical genetic stocks, we have isolated family members of R gene analogs that are associated with either the 2S segment from T. ventricosum carrying the CreX locus or the rust genes. Derivatives of the Cre3 candidate R gene sequence and a rice (Oryza sativa) R gene analog that mapped to the 2S homologous chromosome groups in wheat were used to isolate related gene sequences from T. ventricosum that contain a nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat domain. The potential of these gene sequences as entry points for isolating candidate genes or gene family members of the CreX or rust genes and their further applications to plant breeding are discussed."

"11448734","abstracttext","A waxy mutant of diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum L.) was isolated by screening M(3) seeds derived from 1% ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenized materials with KI-I(2) staining of endosperm starch. This mutant was controlled by a single waxy gene that completely lacked amylose, the 59-kDa waxy protein and the granule-bound starch synthase I (GBSS I) activity in the endosperm. Moreover, the T. monococcum exhibited the gene dosage effects in terms of amylose content, the amount of waxy protein and the GBSS activity. The chain length distribution of amylopectin of the waxy mutant endosperm starch slightly differed from that of the wild type; the long chains of DP>==19 were more enriched in the waxy amylopectin than those in the wild type. The mutant can be an important material for studies on starch metabolism and breeding in Triticum species."

One isolate, with the highest nitrogen-fixation ability from each of the eleven rhizospheres, was selected for further characterisation. Diazotrophic strains were assessed for plant-growth-promoting traits such as indoleacetic acid production and phosphate solubilisation. The phylogenies of 16S rRNA gene of the selected isolates were compared with those based on dnaK and nifH genes. The constructed trees indicated that the isolates were members of the species Azospirillum brasilense, Azospirillum zeae, and Pseudomonas stutzeri. Furthermore, the ipdC gene was detected in all A. brasilence and one A. zeae isolates. The work presented here provides the first molecular genetic evidence for the presence of culturable nitrogen-fixing P. stutzeri and A. zeae associated with field-grown A. sativa and H. vulgare in Greece."
"12378236","articletitle","Genetic mapping of polyphenol oxidase in tetraploid wheat."
"12378236","abstracttext","Pasta colour is one of the main factors influencing pasta quality. It is the product of a desirable yellow component, an undesirable brown component and, under some drying conditions, a red component. The brown colour depends on enzymatic and chemical factors. Polyphenol oxidase (PPO; E.C. 1.14.18.1) is one of the enzymatic factors. It is mainly localised in the peripheral part of the wheat kernel, and is involved in the oxidation of endogenous wheat phenolic compounds resulting in the production of highly coloured products. Therefore, a knowledge of the genetic control of PPO activity could enable the developing of better strategies in breeding programs to reduce pasta darkening. The aim of this study was to map the gene(s) affecting PPO activity using a set of recombinant inbred (RI) lines, derived from a cross between Triticum turgidum L. var. durum cultivar Messapia and the accession MG4343 of Triticum turgidum L. var. dicoccoides. After performing linkage analysis, the gene for high PPO activity was mapped on the long arm of the chromosome 2A and its characteristic was found highly associated to the RFLP marker Xutv1427-2A, with a value of LOD equal to 29.84. The identification of molecular markers linked to loci controlling the PPO activity may potentially accelerate wheat breeding since the selection of plants can be carried out by genotype rather than phenotype."
"23558642","articletitle","A wheat homologue of PHYTOCLOCK 1 is a candidate gene conferring the early heading phenotype to einkorn wheat."
"23558642","abstracttext","An X-ray mutant showing an early flowering phenotype has been identified in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.), for which a major QTL for heading time was previously mapped in the telomeric region on the long arm of chromosome 3A. Recent advances in Triticeae genomics revealed that the gene order in this region is highly conserved between wheat and barley. Thus, we adopted a hypothetical gene order in barley, the so-called GenomeZipper, to develop DNA markers for fine mapping the target gene in wheat. We identified three genes tightly linked to the early heading phenotype. PCR analysis revealed that early-flowering is associated with the deletion of two genes in the mutant. Of the two deleted genes, one is an ortholog of the LUX ARRHYTHMO (LUX)/PHYTOCLOCK 1 (PCL1) gene found in Arabidopsis, which regulates the circadian clock and flowering time. We found distorted expression patterns of two clock genes (TOC1 and LHY) in the einkorn pcl1 deletion mutant as was reported for the Arabidopsis lux mutant. Transcript accumulation levels of photoperiod-response related genes, a photoperiod sensitivity gene (Ppd-1) and two wheat CONSTANS-like genes (WCO1 and TaHd1), were significantly higher in the einkorn wheat mutant. In addition, transcripts of the wheat florigen gene (WFT) accumulated temporally under short-day conditions in the einkorn wheat mutant. These results suggest that deletion of WPCL1 leads to abnormally higher expression of Ppd-1, resulting in the accumulation of WFT transcripts that triggers flowering even under short-day conditions. Our observations from gene mapping, gene deletions, and expression levels of flowering related genes strongly suggest that WPCL1 is the most likely candidate gene for controlling the early flowering phenotype in the einkorn wheat mutant."

"18504540","abstracttext","Triticum monococcum accession TA2026 showed resistance to wheat powdery mildew. To identify the resistance gene and transfer it to common wheat, genetic analysis and molecular mapping were conducted using an F2 population and derived F3 families from the cross of TA2026xM389. The results indicated that TA2026 possessed a recessive powdery mildew resistance gene. This gene was mapped to the terminal portion of chromosome 5AmL and flanked by SSR marker loci Xcfd39 and Xgwm126. Eight RFLP markers previously mapped to the terminal chromosome 5AmL were converted into STS markers. Three loci, detected by MAG1491, MAG1493 and MAG1494, the STS markers derived from RFLP probes CDO1312, PSR164 and PSR1201, respectively, were linked to this resistance gene with Xmag1493 only 0.9 cM apart from it. In addition, the STS marker MAG2170 developed from the tentative consensus wheat cDNA encoding the Mlo-like protein identified a locus co-segregating with Xmag1493. This is the first recessive powdery mildew resistance gene identified on chromosome 5Am, and is temporarily designated pm2026. We have successfully transferred it to a tetraploid background, and this resistance stock will now be used as the bridge parent for its transfer to common wheat."

"33068119","abstracttext","Pre-harvest sprouting (PHS) causes significant losses in wheat yield and quality worldwide. Previously, we cloned a PHS resistance gene, TaPHS1, and identified two causal mutations for reduced seed dormancy (SD) and increased PHS susceptibility. Here we identified a novel allelic variation of C to T transition in 3'-UTR of TaPHS1, which associated with reduced SD and PHS resistance. The T allele occurred in wild wheat progenitors and was likely the earliest functional mutation in TaPHS1 for PHS susceptibility. Allele frequency analysis revealed low frequency of the T allele in wild diploid and tetraploid wheat progenitors, but very high frequency in modern wheat cultivars and breeding lines, indicating that artificial selection quickly enriched the T allele during modern breeding. The T allele was significantly associated with short SD in both T. aestivum and T. durum, the two most cultivated species of wheat. This variation together with previously reported functional sequence variations co-regulated TaPHS1 expression levels and PHS resistance in different germplasms. Haplotype analysis of the four functional variations identified the best PHS resistance haplotype of TaPHS1. The resistance haplotype can be used in marker-assisted selection to transfer TaPHS1 to new wheat cultivars."

"16179990","abstracttext","Proline accumulation and catabolism play significant roles in adaptation to a variety of plant stresses including osmotic stress, drought, temperature, freezing, UV irradiation, heavy metals and pathogen infection. In this study, the gene Delta1 -pyrroline-5-carboxylate dehydrogenase (P5CDH), which catalyzes the second step in the conversion of proline to glutamate, is characterized in a number of cereal species. P5CDH genes from hexaploid wheat, Triticum turgidum (durum wheat), Aegilops tauschii, Triticum monococcum, barley, maize and rice were shown to be conserved in terms of gene structure and sequence, present as a single copy per haploid, non-polyploid genome and located in evolutionarily conserved linkage groups. A wheat cDNA sequence was shown by yeast complementation to encode a functional P5CDH activity. A divergently-transcribed rab7 gene was identified immediately 5' of P5CDH in all grasses examined, except rice. The rab7/P5CDH intergenic region in these species, which presumably encompasses 5' regulatory elements of both genes, showed a distinct pattern of sequence evolution with sequences in juxtaposition to each ORF conserved between barley, wheat, A. tauschii and T. monococcum. More distal 5' sequence in this intergenic region showed a higher rate of divergence, with no homology observed between these regions in the wheat and barley genomes. Maize and rice showed no similarity in regions 5' of P5CDH when compared with wheat, barley, and each other, apart from a 22 bp region of conserved non-coding sequence (CNS) that is similar to a proline response element identified in the promoter of the Arabidopsis proline dehydrogenase gene. A palindromic motif similar to this cereal CNS was also identified 5' of the Arabidopsis AtP5CDH gene showing conservation of this sequence in monocot and dicot lineages."

"31078592","abstracttext","Cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (CRK) constitute one of the largest subfamily of receptor-like kinases, which play crucial roles in plant development and stress response. In total, 43, 37, 36, 38 and 170 CRK genes including duplicated genes were identified in the genome of Brachypodium distachyon, Hordeum vulgare, Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor and Triticum aestivum, respectively. These CRK proteins were tightly clustered into four phylogenetic groups and exhibited close syntenic relationship among orthologous genes. Majority of CRK proteins contain a transmembrane domain for plasma membrane localization. The organization of exon/intron, domains and motifs were variably conserved. Tissue-specific expression suggested the involvement of certain CRK genes in plant development. Modulated expression revealed their specific stress-responsive functions. Co-expression and interaction analysis indicated their role in signaling. Ks value and divergence time analysis suggested duplication of TaCRK genes before the hybridization of T. aestivum sub-genomes. Expression comparison of duplicated TaCRK genes revealed functional retention, neofunctionalization or pseudo-functionalization. Recombinant expression of a stress-responsive gene TaCRK68-A in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae displayed enhanced tolerance against heat, drought, cold and salinity stresses. The study suggested vital functions of CRKs during development and stresses, and provides the basis for functional characterization of each gene in future studies."

"30726948","abstracttext","In the rhizosphere, complex and dynamic interactions occur between plants and microbial networks that are primarily mediated by root exudation. Plants exude various metabolites that may influence the rhizosphere microbiota. However, few studies have sought to understand the role of root exudation in shaping the functional capacities of the microbiota. In this study, we aimed to determine the impact of plants on the diversity of active microbiota and their ability to denitrify via root exudates. For that purpose, we grew four plant species, Triticum aestivum, Brassica napus, Medicago truncatula and Arabidopsis thaliana separately in the same soil. We extracted RNA from the root-adhering soil and the root tissues, and we analysed the bacterial diversity by using 16S rRNA metabarcoding. We measured denitrification activity and denitrification gene expression (nirK and nirS) from each root-adhering soil sample and the root tissues using gas chromatography and quantitative PCR, respectively. We demonstrated that plant species shape denitrification activity and modulate the diversity of the active microbiota through root exudation. We observed a positive effect of T. aestivum and A. thaliana on denitrification activity and nirK gene expression on the root systems. Together, our results underscore the potential power of host plants in controlling microbial activities."

"32978439","abstracttext","Potassium (K) is essential for plant growth and stress responses. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in adaptation to nutrient deprivation through modulating gene expression. Here, we identified the miRNAs responsive to K deficiency in Triticum aestivum based on high-throughput small RNA sequencing analyses. Eighty-nine miRNAs, including 68 previously reported ones and 21 novel ones, displayed differential expression under K deficiency. In Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia and Genome analyses, the putative target genes of the differentially expressed miRNAs were categorized into functional groups associated with ADP-binding activity, secondary metabolic pathways, and biosynthesis and metabolism. Functional characterization of tae-miR408, an miRNA significantly down-regulated under K deficiency, revealed its important role in mediating low-K tolerance. Compared with wild type, transgenic tobacco lines overexpressing tae-miR408 showed significantly improved K uptake, biomass, photosynthesis, and reactive oxygen species scavenging under K deficiency. These results show that distinct miRNAs function in the plant response to K deficiency through regulating target genes involved in energy metabolism and various secondary metabolic pathways. Our findings shed light on the plant response to K deficiency mediated by miRNAs in T. aestivum. Distinct miRNAs, such as tae-miR408, are valuable targets for generating crop varieties with improved K-use efficiency."

"8980492","abstracttext","To isolate genes specifically expressed at the initiation of plant embryo development we have applied a sensitive subtractive hybridization technique for three isogenic wheat lines of the so-called 'Salmon system' with either zygotic or autonomous embryo development. Here we present a gene sequence showing a high homology to grass pollen allergens of type II/III thought to be expressed in pollen tissue only. Surprisingly, the pollen allergen-like sequence, designated Tri a III, is also expressed in gynoecia of the sexual, male fertile wheat line '(aestivum)-Salmon', whereas the two parthenogenetic and male sterile wheat lines '(caudata)-Salmon' and '(kotschyi)-Salmon' completely lack any Tri a III transcript. Our data suggest a positive correlation between the expression of this clone and the manifestation of male fertility. Northern and in situ hybridization analysis revealed that, in addition to its presence in pollen, Tri a III is expressed in the parenchymatous tissue of '(aestivum)-Salmon' ovaries exclusively at the day of anthesis. This precise temporal and spatial expression pattern suggests a more general function of the pollen allergen-like sequence Tri a III not limited to the exhibition of allergens in pollen grains."

Ten gene family members were identified in diploid barley, Hordeum vulgare, and in rye, Secale cereale, seven in Brachypodium distachyon, and six in rice, Oryza sativa. The analysis of gene expression was assayed in triticale and rye by RNA-Seq analysis of 454 sequence sets and members of the gene family were found to have diverse patterns of gene expression in the different tissues that were sampled in rye and in triticale, the hybrid hexaploid species derived from wheat and rye. Expression of the gene family in wheat and barley was also previously determined by microarray analysis, and changes in expression during development and in response to environmental stresses are presented."
"24673767","abstracttext_conclusions","The caleosin gene family had a greater degree of expansion in the Triticeae than in the other monocot species, Brachypodium and rice. The prior implication of one member of the gene family in the stress response and heterotrimeric G protein signaling, points to the potential importance of the caleosin gene family. The complexity of the family and differential expression in various tissues and under conditions of abiotic stress suggests the possibility that caleosin family members may play diverse roles in signaling and development that warrants further investigation."

"24875418","abstracttext","Male sterile cytoplasm plays an important role in hybrid wheat, and three-line system including male sterile (A line), its maintainer (B line) and restoring (R line) has played a major role in wheat hybrid production. It is well known that DNA methylation plays an important role in gene expression regulation during biological development in wheat. However, no reports are available on DNA methylation affected by different male sterile cytoplasms in hybrid wheat. We employed a methylation-sensitive amplified polymorphism technique to characterize nuclear DNA methylation in three male sterile cytoplasms. A and B lines share the same nucleus, but have different cytoplasms which is male sterile for the A and fertile for the B. The results revealed a relationship of DNA methylation at these sites specifically with male sterile cytoplasms, as well as male sterility, since the only difference between the A lines and B line was the cytoplasm. The DNA methylation was markedly affected by male sterile cytoplasms. K-type cytoplasm affected the methylation to a much greater degree than T-type and S-type cytoplasms, as indicated by the ratio of methylated sites, ratio of fully methylated sites, and polymorphism between A lines and B line for these cytoplasms. The genetic distance between the cytoplasm and nucleus for the K-type is much greater than for the T- and S-types because the former is between Aegilops genus and Triticum genus and the latter is within Triticum genus between Triticum spelta and Triticum timopheevii species. Thus, this difference in genetic distance may be responsible for the variation in methylation that we observed."

"24368329","abstracttext","The WUSCHEL (WUS)-related homeobox (WOX) gene family plays an important role in coordinating gene transcription in the early phases of embryogenesis. In this study, we isolated and characterized WOX5 from common wheat and its relatives Triticum monococcum, Triticum urartu, Aegilops speltoides, Aegilops searsii, Aegilops sharonensis, Aegilops longissima, Aegilops bicornis, Aegilops tauschii, and Triticum turgidum. The size of the characterized WOX5 alleles ranged from 1029 to 1038 bp and encompassed the complete open reading frame (ORF) as well as 5' upstream and 3' downstream sequences. Domain prediction analysis showed that the putative primary structures of wheat WOX5 protein include the highly conserved homeodomain besides the WUS-box domain and the EAR-like domain, which is/are present in some members of the WOX protein family. The full-length ORF was subcloned into a prokaryotic expression vector pET30a, and an approximate 26-kDa protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells with IPTG induction. The WOX5 genes from wheat-related species exhibit a similar structure to and high sequence similarity with WOX5 genes from common wheat. The degree of divergence and phylogenetic tree analysis among WOX5 alleles suggested the existence of three homoeologous copies in the A, B, or D genome of common wheat. Quantitative PCR results showed that TaWOX5 was primarily expressed in the root and calli induced by auxin and cytokinin, indicating that TaWOX5 may play a role related to root formation or development and is associated with hormone regulation in somatic embryogenesis."
"31821649","articletitle","Genome-wide sequence information reveals recurrent hybridization among diploid wheat wild relatives."
"31821649","abstracttext","Many conflicting hypotheses regarding the relationships among crops and wild species closely related to wheat (the genera Aegilops, Amblyopyrum, and Triticum) have been postulated. The contribution of hybridization to the evolution of these taxa is intensely discussed. To determine possible causes for this, and provide a phylogeny of the diploid taxa based on genome-wide sequence information, independent data were obtained from genotyping-by-sequencing and a target-enrichment experiment that returned 244 low-copy nuclear loci. The data were analyzed using Bayesian, likelihood and coalescent-based methods. D statistics were used to test if incomplete lineage sorting alone or together with hybridization is the source for incongruent gene trees. Here we present the phylogeny of all diploid species of the wheat wild relatives. We hypothesize that most of the wheat-group species were shaped by a primordial homoploid hybrid speciation event involving the ancestral Triticum and Am. muticum lineages to form all other species except Ae. speltoides. This hybridization event was followed by multiple introgressions affecting all taxa except Triticum. Mostly progenitors of the extant species were involved in these processes, while recent interspecific gene flow seems insignificant. The composite nature of many genomes of wheat-group taxa results in complicated patterns of diploid contributions when these lineages are involved in polyploid formation, which is, for example, the case for tetraploid and hexaploid wheats. Our analysis provides phylogenetic relationships and a testable hypothesis for the genome compositions in the basic evolutionary units within the wheat group of Triticeae."

A quantitative trait locus, derived from a Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides accession (DIC), with an average increase in GPC of 14 g kg(-1) was mapped on chromosome 6BS. Using the wheat-rice colinearity, a high-density map of the wheat region was developed and the quantitative trait locus was mapped as a simple Mendelian locus designated Gpc-B1. A physical map of approx. 250 kb of the Gpc-B1 region was developed using a tetraploid wheat bacterial artificial chromosome library. The constructed physical map included the two Gpc-B1 flanking markers and one potential candidate gene from the colinear rice region completely linked to Gpc-B1. The relationship between physical and genetic distances and the feasibility of isolating genes by positional cloning in wheat are discussed. A high-throughput codominant marker, Xuhw89, was developed. A 4-bp deletion present in the DIC allele was absent in a collection of 117 cultivated tetraploid and hexaploid wheat germplasm, suggesting that this marker will be useful to incorporate the high GPC allele from the DIC accession studied here into commercial wheat varieties."

"25205592","abstracttext","Mapping-by-sequencing analyses have largely required a complete reference sequence and employed whole genome re-sequencing. In species such as wheat, no finished genome reference sequence is available. Additionally, because of its large genome size (17 Gb), re-sequencing at sufficient depth of coverage is not practical. Here, we extend the utility of mapping by sequencing, developing a bespoke pipeline and algorithm to map an early-flowering locus in einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum L.) that is closely related to the bread wheat genome A progenitor. We have developed a genomic enrichment approach using the gene-rich regions of hexaploid bread wheat to design a 110-Mbp NimbleGen SeqCap EZ in solution capture probe set, representing the majority of genes in wheat. Here, we use the capture probe set to enrich and sequence an F2 mapping population of the mutant. The mutant locus was identified in T. monococcum, which lacks a complete genome reference sequence, by mapping the enriched data set onto pseudo-chromosomes derived from the capture probe target sequence, with a long-range order of genes based on synteny of wheat with Brachypodium distachyon. Using this approach we are able to map the region and identify a set of deleted genes within the interval."

Here, we reported that the lateral root number on the primary root (LRNPR) of synthetic and natural allohexaploid wheats (BBAADD) is significantly higher than that of their allotetraploid (BBAA) and diploid (AA and SS) progenitors, but is much lower than that of their diploid (DD) progenitors. The expression of the wheat gene TaLBD16, an ortholog of the Arabidopsis LATERAL ORGAN BOUNDARIES-DOMAIN16/ASYMMETRIC LEAVES2-LIKE18 (LBD16), which is involved in lateral root development in Arabidopsis, was positively correlated with the LRNPR in diploid and allopolyploid wheats. In natural and synthetic allohexaploid wheats, the transcript of the TaLBD16 from the D genome (TaLBD16-D) was relatively more abundant compared with TaLBD16-A and TaLBD16-B. Consistent with the observed variation in LRNPR, the divergence in the expression of TaLBD16 homoeologous genes occurred before the formation of polyploidy wheat. Collectively, our observations indicate that the D genome played a crucial role in the increased lateral root number of allohexaploid wheats compared with their allotetraploid progenitors, and that TaLBD16-D was one of the key genes involved in the formation of lateral root number during wheat evolution."

"30754562","abstracttext","Barley yellow dwarf disease, a ubiquitous virus disease of cereal crops worldwide, is caused by a group of related, single-stranded RNA viruses assigned to Luteovirus (Barley yellow dwarf virus [BYDV] spp. PAV, PAS, MAV, and GAV) or Polerovirus (Cereal yellow dwarf virus-RPV) genera or unassigned to a genera (BYDV-SGV, BYDV-RMV, and BYDV-GPV) in the family Luteoviridae (1). Incidence of BYDV in cereal crops (e.g., barley, wheat, and oats) was high, and in recent years, reached epidemic levels in many regions of the Czech Republic. BYDV-PAV and BYDV-PAS have been identified in Czech cereal crops (2,4). Surveys of the incidence of BYDV were carried out using ELISA (SEDIAG SAS, Longvic, France) and one-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) (2) during 2007 and 2008. Samples (125) were collected from different fields around the Czech Republic and 96 were BYDV positive. Three of the field isolates, CZ-6815, CZ-1561, and CZ-10844, from oat (Avena sativa; cv. Auron), winter wheat (Triticum aestivum; cv. Apache), and winter barley (Hordeum vulgare; cv. Merlot), respectively, were identified as BYDV-MAV by sequencing of the RT-PCR product (641-bp fragment) used to identify BYDV, which spanned 2839-3479 of the BYDV genome (GenBank Accession Nos. EF043235 and NC_002160) (2). The partial coat protein gene sequence of 483 nt was compared with the available sequences of 12 BYDV-PAV isolates (PAV-JP, PAV-NY, PAV-ILL, PAV-AUS, PAV-WG2, PAV-whG4y3, PAV-on21-4, Tahoe1, CA-PAV, HB3, FH3, and MA9501); nine BYDV-PAS isolates (PAS-129, PAS-64, WS6603, WG13, PAS-Tcb4-1, PASwaw5-9, FL2, PAS-Vd29, and PAS-MA9516); and six BYDV-MAV isolates (MAV-CA, MAV-PS1X1, MAV-Alameds268, LMB2a, SI-o4, and MAV-CN) by MEGA4 (3). Nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities for the three isolates ranged from 92.9 to 99.4% and 88.0 to 95.8%, respectively, for available BYDV-MAV isolates; 76.8 to 78.2% and 62.7 to 67.6%, respectively, for available BYDV-PAS isolates; and 77.6 to 79.3% and 65.5 to 70.4%, respectively, for available PAV isolates. The sequence data indicates that these isolates (CZ-6815, CZ-1561, and CZ10844; GenBank Accession Nos. FJ645747, FJ645758, and FJ645746, respectively) are BYDV-MAV.

"22900990","abstracttext","The wheat-alien small segment translocation (SAST) lines carrying the beneficial genes from wild species are useful genetic stocks for wheat improvement. In this study, to introduce the grain hardness-related genes of Haynaldia villosa (L.) Schur. into common wheat (Triticum aesitivum L.), the mature female gametes of whole-arm wheat--H. villosa translocation line T5VS·5DL was irradiated by 60CO-γ ray to develop SAST lines involving 5VS. Among the BC2F2 population, six homozygous SAST lines with different fragment sizes of 5VS were identified by GISH, and the exact fragment sizes were further defined using four 5VS-specific markers and four Ha gene-based markers. The results showed that five lines (NAU5VS-1 to NAU5VS-5) carried the softness gene Dina/Dinb of H. villosa, and that NAU5VS-5 had the smallest alien translocation segment, identified to be a 5VS-6AS·6AL terminal translocation. The translocation chromosome 5VS-6AS·6AL was proved to be stably inherited to the successive generations. In the BC3F2 generation, the individuals having the homozygous 5VS-6AS·6AL translocation chromosomes all showed soft grain texture, with an approximately 50% reduction in the SKCS hardness index compared with that of their backcrossing parent. Both the 5VS-6AS·6AL translocation line and the molecular markers developed in this study will be valuable in wheat breeding for soft grain quality improvement."

"32170056","abstracttext","Perception of pathogenic effectors in plants often relies on nucleotide-binding domain (NBS) and leucine-rich-repeat-containing (NLR) proteins. Some NLRs contain additional domains that function as integrated decoys for pathogen effector targets and activation of immune signalling. Wheat stripe rust is one of the most devastating diseases of crop plants. Here, we report the cloning of YrU1, a stripe rust resistance gene from the diploid wheat Triticum urartu, the progenitor of the A genome of hexaploid wheat. YrU1 encodes a coiled-coil-NBS-leucine-rich repeat protein with N-terminal ankyrin-repeat and C-terminal WRKY domains, representing a unique NLR structure in plants. Database searches identify similar architecture only in wheat relatives. Transient expression of YrU1 in Nicotiana benthamiana does not induce cell death in the absence of pathogens. The ankyrin-repeat and coiled-coil domains of YrU1 self-associate, suggesting that homodimerisation is critical for YrU1 function. The identification and cloning of this disease resistance gene sheds light on NLR protein function and may facilitate breeding to control the devastating wheat stripe rust disease."

"30347757","abstracttext","The branched spike phenotype is an important supernumerary spikelet trait of Triticum turgidum L. associated with the production of significantly more grains per spike, thereby offering a higher potential yield. However, the genetic basis of branch meristem (BM) development remains to be fully elucidated in wheat. TAW1, an ALOG (Arabidopsis LSH1 and Oryza G1) family gene, has been shown to function as a unique regulator in promoting BM development in rice. In this study, we found that the development pattern of the BMs of the branched spike in wheat was similar to the indeterminate BMs of rice. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis classified the ALOG genes into 12 groups. This family of genes was found to have evolved independently in eudicots and monocots and was evolutionarily conserved between wheat and rice as well as during wheat polyploidization. Furthermore, experiments revealed that TtALOG2-1A, a TAW1-homologous gene, plays a significant role in regulating the transition of indeterminate BM fate. Finally, large-scale RNA-sequencing studies and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) experiments revealed that members of the TtALOGs may act upstream of the TtMADS22, TtMADS47, and TtMADS55 genes to promote indeterminate BM activities. Our findings further knowledge on BM development in wheat."

"24243208","abstracttext","The method described involves an initial incubation of wheat immature embryos in a liquid culture of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. The Agrobacterium strain is engineered to contain a binary vector with a gene of interest and a selectable marker gene placed between the T-DNA borders; the T-DNA is the region transferred to the plant cells, thus harnessing the bacterium's natural ability to deliver specific DNA into host cells. Following the initial inoculation with the Agrobacterium, the embryos are co-cultivated for several days after which the Agrobacterium is selectively destroyed using an antibiotic. Tissue culture of the embryos on plant media with a correct balance of hormones allows embryogenic callus formation followed by regeneration of plantlets, and in the later stages of tissue culture a selectable marker (herbicide) is included to minimize the incidence of non-transformed plants. This protocol has been used successfully to generate transformed plants of a wide range of wheat varieties, both spring and winter bread wheats (T. aestivum L.) and durum wheats (T. turgidum L.)."

"12604784","abstracttext","Wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, is the progenitor of modern tetraploid and hexaploid cultivated wheats. Our objective was to map domestication-related quantitative trait loci (QTL) in T. dicoccoides. The studied traits include brittle rachis, heading date, plant height, grain size, yield, and yield components. Our mapping population was derived from a cross between T. dicoccoides and Triticum durum. Approximately 70 domestication QTL effects were detected, nonrandomly distributed among and along chromosomes. Seven domestication syndrome factors were proposed, each affecting 5-11 traits. We showed: (i) clustering and strong effects of some QTLs; (ii) remarkable genomic association of strong domestication-related QTLs with gene-rich regions; and (iii) unexpected predominance of QTL effects in the A genome. The A genome of wheat may have played a more important role than the B genome during domestication evolution. The cryptic beneficial alleles at specific QTLs derived from T. dicoccoides may contribute to wheat and cereal improvement."
"30824973","articletitle","Molecular characterization of a novel TaGL3-5A allele and its association with grain length in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)."
"30824973","abstracttext_key message","We isolated a novel allele associated with grain length and grain weight in wheat, TaGL3-5A-G. The TaGL3-5A-G allele frequency is low in wheat, so it has potential for breeding. Selection of large-grain wheat showing big grain sink potential and strong sink activity is becoming an important objective in breeding programs. Here, we cloned a wheat TaGL3-5A gene that was orthologous to rice GL3 and was phylogenetically clustered with both monocot PPKL1 and its expression pattern was similar to grain size change at early and middle stages of seed development. The isolated TaGL3-5A genomic sequence was 10,227 bp long and included 21 exons and 20 introns. Alignment of the TaGL3-5A sequences in Beinong 6 and Yanda 1817 showed a G/A substitution in the 11th exon (position 5946) that would lead to an amino acid change (Met/Ile). Subsequently, a KASP marker was designed based on this SNP. Genotyping of RILs showed that TaGL3-5A was located on the wheat 5AL chromosome and was colocated with a significant grain length QTL in three independent environments and mean value. Association analysis revealed that the TaGL3-5A-G allele was significantly correlated with longer grains and higher thousand-kernel weight. Haplotype association analysis indicated that TaGL3-5A-G could enhance grain traits in combination with TaGS5-3A and TaGW2-6B. The frequency of TaGL3-5A-G was higher in modern cultivars than in landraces but was still low in major Chinese wheat production areas. Additionally, the frequency of the TaGL3-5A-G allele in hexaploid wheat was slightly lower than in Triticum dicoccoides and much lower than in Triticum turgidum. Hence, T. dicoccoides and T. turgidum represent valuable resources for transferring the TaGL3-5A-G allele into common wheat, which should lead to longer grain length."

"26132381","abstracttext","Gliadins are the major components of storage proteins in wheat grains, and they play an essential role in the dough extensibility and nutritional quality of flour. Because of the large number of the gliadin family members, the high level of sequence identity, and the lack of abundant genomic data for Triticum species, identifying the full complement of gliadin family genes in hexaploid wheat remains challenging. Triticum urartu is a wild diploid wheat species and considered the A-genome donor of polyploid wheat species. The accession PI428198 (G1812) was chosen to determine the complete composition of the gliadin gene families in the wheat A-genome using the available draft genome. Using a PCR-based cloning strategy for genomic DNA and mRNA as well as a bioinformatics analysis of genomic sequence data, 28 gliadin genes were characterized. Of these genes, 23 were α-gliadin genes, three were γ-gliadin genes and two were ω-gliadin genes. An RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) survey of the dynamic expression patterns of gliadin genes revealed that their synthesis in immature grains began prior to 10 days post-anthesis (DPA), peaked at 15 DPA and gradually decreased at 20 DPA. The accumulation of proteins encoded by 16 of the expressed gliadin genes was further verified and quantified using proteomic methods. The phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that the homologs of these α-gliadin genes were present in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, which was consistent with T. urartu being the A-genome progenitor species. This study presents a systematic investigation of the gliadin gene families in T. urartu that spans the genome, transcriptome and proteome, and it provides new information to better understand the molecular structure, expression profiles and evolution of the gliadin genes in T. urartu and common wheat."

"32630293","abstracttext","Stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Eriks. is a dangerous disease of common wheat worldwide. Development and cultivation of the varieties with genetic resistance is one of the most effective and environmentally important ways for protection of wheat against fungal pathogens. Field phytopathological screening and genome-wide association study (GWAS) were used for assessment of the genetic diversity of a collection of spring wheat genotypes on stem rust resistance loci. The collection consisting of Russian varieties of spring wheat and introgression lines with alien genetic materials was evaluated over three seasons (2016, 2017 and 2018) for resistance to the native population of stem rust specific to the West Siberian region of Russia. The results indicate that most varieties displayed from moderate to high levels of susceptibility to P. graminis ; 16% of genotypes had resistance or immune response. In total, 13,006 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers obtained from the Infinium 15K array were used to perform genome-wide association analysis. GWAS detected 35 significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) with SNPs located on chromosomes 1A, 2A, 2B, 3B, 5A, 5B, 6A, 7A and 7B. The most significant associations were found on chromosomes 7A and 6A where known resistance genes Sr25 and Sr6Ai = 2 originated from Thinopyrum ssp. are located. Common wheat lines containing introgressed fragments from Triticum timopheevii and Triticum kiharae were found to carry Sr36 gene on 2B chromosome. It has been suggested that the quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapped to the chromosome 5BL may be new loci inherited from the T. timopheevii . It can be inferred that a number of Russian wheat varieties may contain the Sr17 gene, which does not currently provide effective protection against pathogen. This is the first report describing the results of analysis of the genetic factors conferring resistance of Russian spring wheat varieties to stem rust."

The NDH-1 gene loci located in 4Ap, 4Bp, and 4Dp were designated Ndh-A1, Ndh-B1, and Ndh-D1, respectively. Aadh-A2 was previously reported to be located in 6Aq; in this study, Aadh-B2 and Aadh-D2 were localized in 6Bq and 6Dq, respectively. Alcohol dehydrogenase-1 is expressed on AADH-2 zymograms; the presence of a contaminating aliphatic alcohol in one or more reagents is suggested as the probable cause of this phenomenon."

In this study, the DHN gene wzy1-2 was isolated from Triticum aestivum and its K-/S-segment-truncated derivatives were generated. In order to explore the biological function of these two conserved fragments, subcellular localization and dimerization detection assays were performed for the K-/S-segment-truncated derivatives. Results of GFP fusion and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays indicated that WZY1-2 localized to nucleus as a homologous dimer. The S-segment partially regulated the nuclear localization of WZY1-2 but did not affect its dimerization, while the K-segment influenced neither the dimer formation nor the subcellular localization."

"23774066","abstracttext","The stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase (SAD) gene widely exists in all kinds of plants. In this paper, the Camellia sinensis SAD gene (CsSAD) sequence was firstly analyzed by Codon W, CHIPS, and CUSP programs online, and then compared with genomes of the tea plant, other species and SAD genes from 11 plant species. The results show that the CsSAD gene and the selected 73 of C. sinensis genes have similar codon usage bias. The CsSAD gene has a bias toward the synonymous codons with A and T at the third codon position, the same as the 73 of C. sinensis genes. Compared with monocotyledons such as Triticum aestivum and Zea mays, the differences in codon usage frequency between the CsSAD gene and dicotyledons such as Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tobacum are less. Therefore, A. thaliana and N. tobacum expression systems may be more suitable for the expression of the CsSAD gene. The analysis result of SAD genes from 12 plant species also shows that most of the SAD genes are biased toward the synonymous codons with G and C at the third codon position. We believe that the codon usage bias analysis presented in this study will be essential for providing a theoretical basis for discussing the structure and function of the CsSAD gene."

Here, we report on an innovative method for creating such a library for durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) and its application for gene discovery. The use of suitable quantities of 5-azacytidine during the germination phase induced the demethylation of total DNA, and the resulting seedlings potentially express all of the genes present in the genome. A new wheat microarray consisting of 4925 unigenes was developed from the totipotent cDNA library and used to screen for genes that may contribute to differences in the disease resistance of two near-isogenic lines, the durum wheat cultivar Latino and the line 5BIL-42, which are respectively susceptible and resistant to powdery mildew. Fluorescently labeled cDNA was prepared from the RNA of seedlings of the two near-isogenic wheat lines after infection with a single powdery mildew isolate under controlled conditions in the greenhouse. Hybridization to the microarray identified six genes that were differently expressed in the two lines. Four of the sequences could be assigned putative functions based on their similarity to known genes in public databases. Physical mapping of the six genes localized them to two regions of the genome: the centromeric region of chromosome 5B, where the Pm36 resistance gene was previously localized, and chromosome 6B."

Multipathotype seedling tests of biparental populations demonstrated that T. monococcum accession PI 306540 collected in Romania contains a recessive resistance gene effective to all P. graminis f. sp. tritici races screened, including race TTKSK. We will refer to this gene as SrTm4, which is the fourth stem rust resistance gene characterized from T. monococcum. Using two mapping populations derived from crosses of PI 272557×PI 306540 and G3116×PI 306540, we mapped SrTm4 on chromosome arm 2AmL within a 2.1 cM interval flanked by sequence-tagged markers BQ461276 and DR732348, which corresponds to a 240-kb region in Brachypodium chromosome 5. The eight microsatellite and nine sequence-tagged markers linked to SrTm4 will facilitate the introgression and accelerate the deployment of SrTm4-mediated Ug99 resistance in wheat breeding programs."

The 7S (l) L arm seldom paired, likely because this arm lost a relatively long segment and received a very short segment in the interchange with 4S (l) L. Available data suggest that translocation 4S (l) L/7S (l) L arose in the evolution of T. longissimum, which implies that this species was not the donor of the B genome of wheat."

"18248674","abstracttext_results","We constructed six different cDNA libraries derived from developing peanut seeds at three reproduction stages (R5, R6 and R7) from a resistant and a susceptible cultivated peanut genotypes, 'Tifrunner' (susceptible to Aspergillus infection with higher aflatoxin contamination and resistant to TSWV) and 'GT-C20' (resistant to Aspergillus with reduced aflatoxin contamination and susceptible to TSWV). The developing peanut seed tissues were challenged by A. parasiticus and drought stress in the field. A total of 24,192 randomly selected cDNA clones from six libraries were sequenced. After removing vector sequences and quality trimming, 21,777 high-quality EST sequences were generated. Sequence clustering and assembling resulted in 8,689 unique EST sequences with 1,741 tentative consensus EST sequences (TCs) and 6,948 singleton ESTs. Functional classification was performed according to MIPS functional catalogue criteria. The unique EST sequences were divided into twenty-two categories. A similarity search against the non-redundant protein database available from NCBI indicated that 84.78% of total ESTs showed significant similarity to known proteins, of which 165 genes had been previously reported in peanuts. There were differences in overall expression patterns in different libraries and genotypes. A number of sequences were expressed throughout all of the libraries, representing constitutive expressed sequences. In order to identify resistance-related genes with significantly differential expression, a statistical analysis to estimate the relative abundance (R) was used to compare the relative abundance of each gene transcripts in each cDNA library. Thirty six and forty seven unique EST sequences with threshold of R > 4 from libraries of 'GT-C20' and 'Tifrunner', respectively, were selected for examination of temporal gene expression patterns according to EST frequencies. Nine and eight resistance-related genes with significant up-regulation were obtained in 'GT-C20' and 'Tifrunner' libraries, respectively. Among them, three genes were common in both genotypes. Furthermore, a comparison of our EST sequences with other plant sequences in the TIGR Gene Indices libraries showed that the percentage of peanut EST matched to Arabidopsis thaliana, maize (Zea mays), Medicago truncatula, rapeseed (Brassica napus), rice (Oryza sativa), soybean (Glycine max) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) ESTs ranged from 33.84% to 79.46% with the sequence identity >/= 80%. These results revealed that peanut ESTs are more closely related to legume species than to cereal crops, and more homologous to dicot than to monocot plant species."
"18248674","abstracttext_conclusion","The developed ESTs can be used to discover novel sequences or genes, to identify resistance-related genes and to detect the differences among alleles or markers between these resistant and susceptible peanut genotypes. Additionally, this large collection of cultivated peanut EST sequences will make it possible to construct microarrays for gene expression studies and for further characterization of host resistance mechanisms. It will be a valuable genomic resource for the peanut community. The 21,777 ESTs have been deposited to the NCBI GenBank database with accession numbers ES702769 to ES724546."

"24178122","abstracttext","Analysis of the bread wheat variety Schomburgk, and related lines in its pedigree, identified RFLP markers associated with the segment of chromosome 7A carrying the Sr22 gene derived from the diploid species T. boeoticum. The distribution of the RFLP markers indicated that at least 50% of 7AS and 80% of 7AL in Schomburgk is of T. boeoticum origin. Evaluation of five sets of nearisogenic lines, backcross lines in 20 different genetic backgrounds and an F2 population segregating for Sr22 demonstrated a very low level of recombination between the 7A chromosomes of T. boeoticum and T. aestivum. Several recombinants carrying Sr22 but with a much reduced segment of T. boeoticum were identified and these may prove useful in the breeding of further varieties with Sr22."

"22159825","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide. Wild emmer wheat, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, the tetraploid ancestor (AABB) of domesticated bread and durum wheat, harbors many important alleles for resistance to various diseases, including powdery mildew. In the current study, two tetraploid wheat mapping populations, derived from a cross between durum wheat (cv. Langdon) and wild emmer wheat (accession G-305-3M), were used to identify and map a novel powdery mildew resistance gene. Wild emmer accession G-305-3M was resistant to all 47 Bgt isolates tested, from Israel and Switzerland. Segregation ratios of F(2) progenies and F(6) recombinant inbred line (RIL) mapping populations, in their reactions to inoculation with Bgt, revealed a Mendelian pattern (3:1 and 1:1, respectively), indicating the role of a single dominant gene derived from T. dicoccoides accession G-305-3M. This gene, temporarily designated PmG3M, was mapped on chromosome 6BL and physically assigned to chromosome deletion bin 6BL-0.70-1.00. The F(2) mapping population was used to construct a genetic map of the PmG3M gene region consisted of six simple sequence repeats (SSR), 11 resistance gene analog (RGA), and two target region amplification polymorphism (TRAP) markers. A second map, constructed based on the F(6) RIL population, using a set of skeleton SSR markers, confirmed the order of loci and distances obtained for the F(2) population. The discovery and mapping of this novel powdery mildew resistance gene emphasize the importance of the wild emmer wheat gene pool as a source for crop improvement."

"26439791","abstracttext","The genetic tractability of the Hessian fly (HF, Mayetiola destructor) provides an opportunity to investigate the mechanisms insects use to induce plant gall formation. Here we demonstrate that capacity using the newly sequenced HF genome by identifying the gene (vH24) that elicits effector-triggered immunity in wheat (Triticum spp.) seedlings carrying HF resistance gene H24. vH24 was mapped within a 230-kb genomic fragment near the telomere of HF chromosome X1. That fragment contains only 21 putative genes. The best candidate vH24 gene in this region encodes a protein containing a secretion signal and a type-2 serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP2C) domain. This gene has an H24-virulence associated insertion in its promoter that appears to silence transcription of the gene in H24-virulent larvae. Candidate vH24 is a member of a small family of genes that encode secretion signals and PP2C domains. It belongs to the fraction of genes in the HF genome previously predicted to encode effector proteins. Because PP2C proteins are not normally secreted, our results suggest that these are PP2C effectors that HF larvae inject into wheat cells to redirect, or interfere, with wheat signal transduction pathways."

"30795512","abstracttext","Wheat powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici ( Bgt ) is considered a major wheat leaf disease in the main wheat producing regions of the world. Although many resistant wheat cultivars to this disease have been developed, little is known about their resistance mechanisms. Pm40 is a broad, effective resistance gene against powdery mildew in wheat line L699 . The aim of this study was to investigate the resistance proteins after Bgt inoculation in wheat lines L699 , Neimai836 , and Chuannong26 . Neimai836 with Pm21 was used as the resistant control, and Chuannong26 without any effective Pm genes was the susceptible control. Proteins were extracted from wheat leaves sampled 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after Bgt inoculation, separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and stained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. The results showed that different proteins were upregulated and downregulated in three wheat cultivars at different time points. For the wheat cultivar L699 , a total of 62 proteins were upregulated and 71 proteins were downregulated after Bgt inoculation. Among these, 46 upregulated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry analysis using the NCBI nr database of Triticum . The identified proteins were predicted to be associated with the defense response, photosynthesis, signal transduction, carbohydrate metabolism, energy pathway, protein turnover, and cell structure functions. It is inferred that the proteins are not only involved in defense response, but also other physiological and cellular processes to confer wheat resistance against Bgt . Therefore, the resistance products potentially mediate the immune response and coordinate other physiological and cellular processes during the resistance response to Bgt . The lipoxygenase, glucan exohydrolase, glucose adenylyltransferasesmall, phosphoribulokinase, and phosphoglucomutase are first reported to be involved in the interactions of wheat- Bgt at early stage. The further study of these proteins will deepen our understanding of their detailed functions and potentially develop more efficient disease control strategies."

"17219206","abstracttext","Synthetic wheat lines (2n = 6x = 42, AABBDD), which are amphiploids developed from the hybrid between tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L., 2n = 4x = 28, AABB) and Aegilops tauschii Coss. (2n = 2x = 14, DD), are important sources of resistance against tan spot of wheat caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. In the present study, inheritance, allelism and genetic linkage analysis in synthetic wheat lines have been carried out. Segregation analysis of the phenotypic and molecular data in F(2:3) populations of CS/XX41, CS/XX45, and CS/XX110 has revealed a 1:2:1 segregation ratio indicating that resistance of tan spot in these synthetic lines is controlled by a single gene. Allelism tests detected no segregation for susceptibility among F(1) and F(2) plants derived from intercrosses of the resistance lines XX41, XX45 and XX110 indicating that the genes are either allelic or tightly linked. Linkage analysis using SSR markers showed that all the three genes: tsn3a in XX41, Tsn3b in XX45 and tsn3c in XX110 are clustered in the region around Xgwm2a, located on the short arm of chromosome 3D. The linked markers and genetic relationship of these genes will greatly facilitate their use in wheat breeding and deployment of cultivars resistant to tan spot."

"20373964","abstracttext","The pathogenicity to wheat (Pwt1) locus conditions host species specificity of Magnaporthe oryzae on wheat. GFSI1-7-2 (Setaria isolate) carries the avirulence allele (PWT1) at this locus while Br48 (Triticum isolate) carries the virulence allele (pwt1). An F(1) culture derived from a cross between GFSI1-7-2 and Br48 was backcrossed with Br48 to produce a tester population in which PWT1 alone segregated. When hexaploid wheat lines were inoculated with the BC(1)F(1) testers, they were all resistant to all PWT1 carriers and susceptible to all pwt1 carriers, suggesting that they recognize PWT1. When barley cultivars were inoculated with the testers, they showed the same pattern of reactions as the hexaploid lines, suggesting that the barley cultivars also recognize PWT1. These results suggest that PWT1 is a fundamental gene that universally conditions the avirulence of Setaria isolates on two staple crops, hexaploid wheat and barley. Interestingly, tetraploid wheat lines did not recognize PWT1. Molecular mapping using the F(1) and BC(1)F(1) populations revealed that the Pwt1 locus is located on chromosome 2 and tightly linked to the ribosomal DNA locus and a telomere."

"25147022","abstracttext","Despite being a major international crop, our understanding of the wheat genome is relatively poor due to its large size and complexity. To gain a greater understanding of wheat genome diversity, we have identified single nucleotide polymorphisms between 16 Australian bread wheat varieties. Whole-genome shotgun Illumina paired read sequence data were mapped to the draft assemblies of chromosomes 7A, 7B and 7D to identify more than 4 million intervarietal SNPs. SNP density varied between the three genomes, with much greater density observed on the A and B genomes than the D genome. This variation may be a result of substantial gene flow from the tetraploid Triticum turgidum, which possesses A and B genomes, during early co-cultivation of tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. In addition, we examined SNP density variation along the chromosome syntenic builds and identified genes in low-density regions which may have been selected during domestication and breeding. This study highlights the impact of evolution and breeding on the bread wheat genome and provides a substantial resource for trait association and crop improvement. All SNP data are publically available on a generic genome browser GBrowse at www.wheatgenome.info."

"25486537","abstracttext","Aegilops uniaristata has many agronomically useful traits that can be used for wheat breeding. So far, a Triticum turgidum - Ae. uniaristata amphiploid and one set of Chinese Spring (CS) - Ae. uniaristata addition lines have been produced. To guide Ae. uniaristata chromatin transformation from these lines into cultivated wheat through chromosome engineering, reliable cytogenetic and molecular markers specific for Ae. uniaristata chromosomes need to be developed. Standard C-banding shows that C-bands mainly exist in the centromeric regions of Ae. uniaristata but rarely at the distal ends. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) using (GAA)8 as a probe showed that the hybridization signal of chromosomes 1N-7N are different, thus (GAA)8 can be used to identify all Ae. uniaristata chromosomes in wheat background simultaneously. Moreover, a total of 42 molecular markers specific for Ae. uniaristata chromosomes were developed by screening expressed sequence tag - sequence tagged site (EST-STS), expressed sequence tag - simple sequence repeat (EST-SSR), and PCR-based landmark unique gene (PLUG) primers. The markers were subsequently localized using the CS - Ae. uniaristata addition lines and different wheat cultivars as controls. The cytogenetic and molecular markers developed herein will be helpful for screening and identifying wheat - Ae. uniaristata progeny."

"25557089","abstracttext","Wheat evolution is complex as a result of successive rounds of allopolyploidization and continuous selection during domestication. Diploid and tetraploid wheat species (Triticum spp.) were used as model systems in which to study the role of centromere-specific histone H3 variant (CENH3) in wheat evolution. We characterized two types of CENH3 genes, named αCENH3 and βCENH3, each of which has three slightly different copies derived from the AA, BB and DD genomes. Specific antibodies were raised against the two CENH3 proteins and were co-localized to centromeres with subtle differences. In most tetraploid wheat species, CENH3 genes are more highly expressed from the AA genome. In wild tetraploids, βCENH3 has a much lower expression level than αCENH3, while in cultivated tetraploids βCENH3 transcripts are enhanced to near αCENH3 levels. Comparison of the CENH3 proteins in wild and cultivated tetraploids revealed that the histone folding domain (HFD) of only βCENH3 is under positive selection, especially in the region responsible for targeting of CENH3 to the centromere. Taken together, positive selection of βCENH3 and its increased expression in tetraploid cultivars are indicative of adaptive evolution. Furthermore, the differences in localization between αCENH3 and βCENH3 observed using fiber fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunodetection and in developmental phenotypes resulting from virus-reduced gene silencing imply their functional diversification during wheat evolution."

"29961103","abstracttext_key message","We identified a novel allele of the Vrn-A3 gene that is associated with an early flowering trait in wheat. This trait is caused by a cis-element GATA box in Vrn-A3. To identify novel flowering genes in wheat, we investigated days from germination to heading (DGH) in tetraploid wheat accessions. We found that the tetraploid variety Triticum turgidum L. ssp. dicoccum (TN26) harbors unknown genes that surpass the earliness effect of the early flowering allele Ppd-A1a harbored by TN28 (T. turgidum L. ssp. turgidum conv. pyramidale). Using recombinant inbred lines resulting from a cross between TN26 and TN28, we performed a quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis for DGH. We identified a QTL for earliness in TN26 on chromosome 7AS, the chromosome on which Vrn-A3 is located. By sequence analysis for the Vrn-A3 locus in both TN26 and TN28, we identified a 7-bp insertion that included a cis-element GATA box sequence at the promoter region of the Vrn-A3 locus of TN26. Based on an expression analysis using sister lines for Vrn-A3, we suggest that the early flowering trait of TN26 was caused by the GATA box in Vrn-A3. In addition, we identified tetraploid wheat as a useful genetic resource for wheat breeding."

"33063291","abstracttext","The grain protein content (GPC) in modern wheat is inherently low. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, 2n = 4x = 28, AABB) gene pool harbors wide genotypic variations in GPC. However, the characterization of candidate genes associated with high GPC is a challenge due to the complex characteristic of this trait. In the current study, we performed RNA-seq analysis on developing grains of wild emmer genotype D1, common wheat CN16, and their hexaploid wide hybrid BAd107-4 with contrasting GPC. We have found a total of 39,795 expressed genes on chromosomes A and B, of which 24,152 were shared between D1, CN16, and BAd107-4. From 1744 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), 1203 were downregulated and 541 were upregulated in the high GPC (D1+BAd107-4) compared with low GPC (CN16) groups. The majority of DEGs were associated with protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum, starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, and protein export pathways. Expression levels of nine randomly selected genes were verified by qRT-PCR, which was consistent with the transcriptome data. The present database will help us to understand the potential regulation networks underlying wheat grain protein accumulation and provide the foundation for simultaneous improvement of grain protein content and yield in wheat breeding programs."

The isozymes are dimers with the same molecular weight (116,000 +/- 2,000), but significantly different isoelectric pH values.

"24227030","abstracttext","Hybrid necrosis in wheat is a barrier to gene transfer in wheat breeding practice. It is based on two complementary genes, Ne1 and Ne2. Recovery mutants (Re1, Re2 and Re3) which can grow to maturity were recovered from immature embryo cultures of necrotic hybrids between T. aestivum and T. durum. Cytological observation demonstrated that Re1 had 34 chromosomes instead of 35. This indicated that one of the chromosomes carrying the Ne genes was lost. Genetic study suggested that for Re1, the lost chromosome was chromosome 5B of the durum parental line. Re mutants are male sterile but can be maintained through a young ear culture method. Re mutants could be successfully pollinated by either parental line and the BC1 progeny is partially fertile. Re mutants were repeatedly induced in about 1% of the regenerated plants from immature embryo culture. This technique provides a practical way to bypass hybrid necrosis."

We found considerable differences in the content and distribution of repetitive sequences between the A and B subgenomes. The gene contents of individual chromosomes varied widely, not necessarily correlating with chromosome size. We catalogued candidate agronomically important loci, along with new alleles and flanking sequences that can be used to design exome sequencing. Syntenic relationships and virtual gene orders revealed several small-scale evolutionary rearrangements, in addition to providing evidence for the 4AL-5AL-7BS translocation in wild emmer wheat. Chromosome-based sequence assemblies contained five novel miRNA families, among 59 families putatively encoded in the entire genome which provide insight into the domestication of wheat and an overview of the genome content and organization."

"8725245","abstracttext","The distribution of genes and recombination in the wheat genome was studied by comparing physical maps with the genetic linkage maps. The physical maps were generated by mapping 80 DNA and two phenotypic markers on an array of 65 deletion lines for homoeologous group 5 chromosomes. The genetic maps were constructed for chromosome 5B in wheat and 5D in Triticum tauschii. No marker mapped in the proximal 20% chromosome region surrounding the centromere. More than 60% of the long arm markers were present in three major clusters that physically encompassed < 18% of the arm. Because 48% of the markers were cDNA clones and the distributions of the cDNA and genomic clones were similar, the marker distribution may represent the distribution of genes. The gene clusters were identified and allocated to very small chromosome regions because of a higher number of deletions in their surrounding regions. The recombination was suppressed in the centromeric regions and mainly occurred in the gene-rich regions. The bp/cM estimates varied from 118 kb for gene-rich regions to 22 Mb for gene-poor regions. The wheat genes present in these clusters are, therefore, amenable to molecular manipulations parallel to the plants with smaller genomes like rice."

"25703105","abstracttext","Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are members of the family of pathogenesis-related proteins (PR-14) that are believed to be involved in plant defense responses. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of a novel gene TdLTP4 encoding an LTP protein from durum wheat [Triticum turgidum L. subsp. Durum Desf.]. Molecular Phylogeny analyses of wheat TdLTP4 gene showed a high identity to other plant LTPs. Predicted three-dimensional structural model revealed the presence of six helices and nine loop turns. Expression analysis in two local durum wheat varieties with marked differences in salt and drought tolerance, revealed a higher transcript accumulation of TdLTP4 under different stress conditions in the tolerant variety, compared to the sensitive one. The overexpression of TdLTP4 in Arabidopsis resulted in a promoted plant growth under various stress conditions including NaCl, ABA, JA and H2O2 treatments. Moreover, the LTP-overexpressing lines exhibit less sensitivity to jasmonate than wild-type plants. Furthermore, detached leaves from transgenic Arabidopsis expressing TdLTP4 gene showed enhanced fungal resistance against Alternaria solani and Botrytis cinerea. Together, these data provide the evidence for the involvement of TdLTP4 gene in the tolerance to both abiotic and biotic stresses in crop plants."

"23364940","abstracttext","In a non-model staple crop like wheat (Triticum aestivumI L.), functional validation of potential drought stress responsive genes identified in Arabidopsis could provide gene targets for breeding. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of genes of interest can overcome the inherent problems of polyploidy and limited transformation potential that hamper functional validation studies in wheat. In this study, three potential candidate genes shown to be involved in abiotic stress response pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana were selected for VIGS experiments in wheat. These include Era1 (enhanced response to abscisic acid), Cyp707a (ABA 8'-hydroxylase), and Sal1 (inositol polyphosphate 1-phosphatase). Gene homologues for these three genes were identified in wheat and cloned in the viral vector barley stripe mosaic virus (BSMV) in the antisense direction, followed by rub inoculation of BSMV viral RNA transcripts onto wheat plants. Quantitative real-time PCR showed that VIGS-treated wheat plants had significant reductions in target gene transcripts. When VIGS-treated plants generated for Era1 and Sal1 were subjected to limiting water conditions, they showed increased relative water content, improved water use efficiency, reduced gas exchange, and better vigour compared to water-stressed control plants inoculated with RNA from the empty viral vector (BSMV0). In comparison, the Cyp707a-silenced plants showed no improvement over BSMV0-inoculated plants under limited water condition. These results indicate that Era1 and Sal1 play important roles in conferring drought tolerance in wheat. Other traits affected by Era1 silencing were also studied. Delayed seed germination in Era1-silenced plants suggests this gene may be a useful target for developing resistance to pre-harvest sprouting."

"31863156","abstracttext_key message","A single dominant gene found in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat controls broad-spectrum race-nonspecific resistance to the foliar disease tan spot caused by Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. Tan spot is an important foliar disease of durum and common wheat caused by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Pyrenophora tritici-repentis. Genetic studies in common wheat have shown that pathogen-produced necrotrophic effectors interact with host genes in an inverse gene-for-gene manner to cause disease, but quantitative trait loci (QTLs) with broad race-nonspecific resistance also exist. Less work has been done to understand the genetics of tan spot interactions in durum wheat. Here, we evaluated a set of Langdon durum-wild emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) disomic chromosome substitution lines for reaction to four P. tritici-repentis isolates representing races 1, 2, 3, and 5 to identify wild emmer chromosomes potentially containing tan spot resistance genes. Chromosome 3B from the wild emmer accession IsraelA rendered the tan spot-susceptible durum cultivar Langdon resistant to all four fungal isolates. Genetic analysis indicated that a single dominant gene, designated Tsr7, governed resistance. Detailed mapping experiments showed that the Tsr7 locus is likely the same as the race-nonspecific QTL previously identified in the hexaploid wheat cultivars BR34 and Penawawa. Four user-friendly SNP-based semi-thermal asymmetric reverse PCR (STARP) markers cosegregated with Tsr7 and should be useful for marker-assisted selection of resistance. In addition to 3B, other wild emmer chromosomes contributed moderate levels of tan spot resistance, and, as has been shown previously for tetraploid wheat, the Tsn1-Ptr ToxA interaction was not associated with susceptibility. This is the first report of a major dominant gene governing resistance to tan spot in tetraploid wheat."

The sequence that was termed Mariam, does not show any structural similarity to known TEs. It does not possess terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) that would allow us to assign this element to one of the TIR DNA super-families, and it does not possess characteristic features of SINE, such as a Pol-III promotor or a poly-A tail. In-silico analysis of five publicly available genome drafts of Triticum and Aegilops species revealed that Mariam element appears in a very low copy number (1-3 insertions) in diploid wheat species and ~ 12 insertions in tetraploid and hexaploidy wheat species. In addition, Mariam element was found to be unique to wheat, as it was not found in other plant genomes. The dynamic nature of Mariam in the wheat genome was assessed by site-specific PCR analysis and revealed that it retained activity in wild emmer populations in a population-specific manner."

"12590343","abstracttext","A bacterial-artificial-chromosome (BAC) clone from the genome of Triticum tauschii, the D-genome ancestor of hexaploid bread wheat, was sequenced and the presence of the two paralogous x- and y-type high-molecular-weight (HMW) glutenin genes of the Glu-D1 locus was confirmed. These two genes occur in the same orientation, are 51,893 bp apart, and the separating DNA includes a 31,000-bp cluster of retrotransposons. A second retrotransposon cluster of 32,000 bp follows the x-type HMW-glutenin gene region. Each HMW-glutenin gene is found within a region of mainly unique DNA sequence which includes multiple additional genes including an active endosperm globulin gene not previously reported in the Triticeae family, a leucine-rich-repeat (LRR) type gene truncated at the 5' end of the BAC, a kinase gene of unknown activity, remnants of a paralogous second globulin gene, and genes similar to two hypothetical rice genes. The newly identified globulin genes are assigned to a locus designated Glo-2. Comparison to available orthologous regions of the wheat A and B genomes show rapid sequence divergences flanking the HMW-glutenin genes, and the absence of two hypothetical and unknown genes found 5' to the B-genome x-type ortholog. The region surrounding the Glu-D1 locus is similar to other reported Triticeae BAC sequences; i.e. small gene islands separated by retrotransposon clusters."

"25223217","abstracttext","Extensive gene flow between wheat (Triticum sp.) and several wild relatives of the genus Aegilops has recently been detected despite notoriously high levels of selfing in these species. Here, we assess and model the spread of wheat alleles into natural populations of the barbed goatgrass (Aegilops triuncialis), a wild wheat relative prevailing in the Mediterranean flora. Our sampling, based on an extensive survey of 31 Ae. triuncialis populations collected along a 60 km × 20 km area in southern Spain (Grazalema Mountain chain, Andalousia, totalling 458 specimens), is completed with 33 wheat cultivars representative of the European domesticated pool. All specimens were genotyped with amplified fragment length polymorphism with the aim of estimating wheat admixture levels in Ae. triuncialis populations. This survey first confirmed extensive hybridization and backcrossing of wheat into the wild species. We then used explicit modelling of populations and approximate Bayesian computation to estimate the selfing rate of Ae. triuncialis along with the magnitude, the tempo and the geographical distance over which wheat alleles introgress into Ae. triuncialis populations. These simulations confirmed that extensive introgression of wheat alleles (2.7 × 10(-4) wheat immigrants for each Ae. triuncialis resident, at each generation) into Ae. triuncialis occurs despite a high selfing rate (Fis ≈ 1 and selfing rate = 97%). These results are discussed in the light of risks associated with the release of genetically modified wheat cultivars in Mediterranean agrosystems."

"31451719","abstracttext","Synthetic hexaploid (SH) wheat (AABBD'D') is developed by artificially generating a fertile hybrid between tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum, AABB) and diploid wild goat grass (Aegilops tauschii, D'D'). Over three decades, the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) has developed and utilized SH wheat to bridge gene transfer from Ae. tauschii and durum wheat to hexaploid bread wheat. This is a unique example of success utilizing wild relatives in mainstream breeding at large scale worldwide. Our study aimed to determine the genetic contribution of SH wheat to CIMMYT's global spring bread wheat breeding program. We estimated the theoretical and empirical contribution of D' to synthetic derivative lines using the ancestral pedigree and marker information using over 1,600 advanced lines and their parents. The average marker-estimated D' contribution was 17.5% with difference in genome segments suggesting application of differential selection pressure. The pedigree-based contribution was correlated with marker-based estimates without providing chromosome segment specific variation. Results from international yield trials showed that 20% of the lines were synthetic derived with an average D' contribution of 15.6%. Our results underline the importance of SH wheat in maintaining and enhancing genetic diversity and genetic gain over years and is important for development of a more targeted introgression strategy. The study provides retrospective view into development and utilization of SH in the CIMMYT Global Wheat Program."

"26810982","abstracttext_results","We report the cloning and functional analysis of two wheat LRR-RLKs from T. aestivum c.v. Prins- T. timopheevii introgression line IGV1-465, named TaRLK1 and TaRLK2, which play positive roles in regulating powdery mildew resistance in wheat. The two LRR-RLKs contain an ORF of 3,045 nucleotides, encoding a peptide of 1014 amino acids, with seven amino acids difference. Their predicted proteins possess a signal peptide, several LRRs, a trans-membrane domain, and a Ser/Thr protein kinase domain. In response to Bgt infection, the TaRLK1/2 expression is up-regulated in a developmental-stage-dependent manner. Single-cell transient over-expression and gene-silencing assays indicate that both genes positively regulate the resistance to mixed Bgt inoculums. Transgenic lines over-expressing TaRLK1 or TaRLK2 in a moderate powdery mildew susceptible wheat variety Yangmai 158 led to significantly enhanced powdery mildew resistance. Exogenous applied salicylic acid (SA) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) induced the expression of both genes, and H2O2 had a higher accumulation at the Bgt penetration sites in RLK over-expression transgenic plants, suggesting a possible involvement of SA and altered ROS homeostasis in the defense response to Bgt infection. The two LRR-RLKs are located in the long arm of wheat chromosome 2B, in which the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm6 is located, but in different regions."

"28674228","abstracttext","A Triticum timopheevii-derived bread wheat line, Selection G12, was screened with 40 pathotypes of leaf rust pathogen, Puccinia triticina at seedling stage and with two most commonly prevalent pathotypes 77-5 and 104-2 at adult plant stage. Selection G12 showed resistance at both seedling and adult plant stages. Genetic analysis in F 1 , F 2 and F 2.3 families at the seedling stage revealed that leaf rust resistance in Selection G12 is conditioned by a single incompletely dominant gene. The leaf rust resistance gene was mapped to chromosome 3BL with SSR markers Xgwm114 and Xgwm547 flanking the gene at a distance of 28.3 cM and 6 cM, respectively. Based on the nature of resistance and chromosomal location, it is inferred that Selection G12 carries a new gene for leaf rust resistance, tentatively named as LrSelG12."

"28389147","abstracttext","With world population growing quickly, agriculture needs to produce more with fewer inputs while being environmentally friendly. In a context of changing environments, crop models are useful tools to simulate crop yields. Wheat (Triticum spp.) crop models have been evolving since the 1960s to translate processes related to crop growth and development into mathematical equations. These have been used over decades for agronomic purposes, and have more recently incorporated advances in the modeling of environmental footprints, biotic constraints, trait and gene effects, climate change impact, and the upscaling of global change impacts. This review outlines the potential and limitations of modern wheat crop models in assisting agronomists, breeders, and policymakers to address the current and future challenges facing agriculture."

"25993896","abstracttext_key message","Rapid evolution of powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW170 orthologous genomic regions in wheat subgenomes. Wheat is one of the most important staple grain crops in the world and also an excellent model for plant ploidy evolution research with different ploidy levels from diploid to hexaploid. Powdery mildew disease caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici can result in significant loss in both grain yield and quality in wheat. In this study, the wheat powdery mildew resistance gene MlIW170 locus located at the Triticum dicoccoides chromosome 2B short arm was further characterized by constructing and sequencing a BAC-based physical map contig covering a 0.3 cM genetic distance region (880 kb) and developing additional markers to delineate the resistance gene within a 0.16 cM genetic interval (372 kb). Comparative analyses of the T. dicoccoides 2BS region with the orthologous Aegilops tauschii 2DS region showed great gene colinearity, including the structure organization of both types of RGA1/2-like and RPS2-like resistance genes. Comparative analyses with the orthologous regions from Brachypodium and rice genomes revealed considerable dynamic evolutionary changes that have re-shaped this MlIW170 region in the wheat genome, resulting in a high number of non-syntenic genes including resistance-related genes. This result might reflect the rapid evolution in R-gene regions. Phylogenetic analysis on these resistance-related gene sequences indicated the duplication of these genes in the MlIW170 region, occurred before the separation of the wheat B and D genomes."
"21296583","articletitle","The drought response displayed by a DRE-binding protein from Triticum dicoccoides."
"21296583","abstracttext","Drought is one of the major causes of dramatic yield loss in crop plants. Knowledge of how to alleviate this loss is still limited due to the complexity of both the stress condition and plant responses. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) is a potential source of important drought-resistance genes for its cultivated relatives. The gene for an emmer DRE-binding protein, TdicDRF1, was cloned and shown to be drought-responsive with orthologs in other plants. This is the first report of the cloning of TdicDRF1, and its expression was further characterized by RT-PCR in both drought-sensitive and drought-resistant accessions of Triticum dicoccoides. Analysis of the AP2/ERF DNA-binding domain of TdicDRF1 as a GST-fusion protein and its binding to DRE by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicate functional differences between wheat DREBs and those characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana. DREB expression increased in drought-stressed roots, correlating with the RT-PCR results, but not in leaf, showing that tissue-specific regulation occurs at the protein level. Hence, the DREB-DRE interaction undergoes subtle multi-level regulation."

"10778737","abstracttext","Although cold acclimation in cereals involves the expression of many cold-regulated genes, genetic studies have shown that only very few chromosomal regions carry loci that play an important role in frost tolerance. To investigate the genetic relationship between frost tolerance and the expression of cold-regulated genes, the expression and regulation of the wheat homolog of the barley cold-regulated gene cor14b was studied at various temperatures in frost-sensitive and frost-tolerant wheat genotypes. At 18/15 degrees C (day/night temperatures) frost-tolerant plants accumulated cor14b mRNAs and expressed COR14b proteins, whereas the sensitive plants did not. This result indicates that the threshold temperature for induction of the wheat cor14b homolog is higher in frost-resistant plants, and allowed us to use this polymorphism in a mapping approach. Studies made with chromosome substitution lines showed that the polymorphism for the threshold induction temperature of the wheat cor14b homolog is controlled by a locus(i) located on chromosome 5A of wheat, while the cor14b gene was mapped in Triticum monococcum on the long arm of chromosome 2Am. The analysis of single chromosome recombinant lines derived from a cross between Chinese Spring/Triticum spelta 5A and Chinese Spring/Cheyenne 5A identified two loci with additive effects that are involved in the genetic control of cor14b mRNA accumulation. The first locus was tightly linked to the marker psr911, while the second one was located between the marker Xpsr2021 and Frost resistance 1 (Fr1)."

"21953208","abstracttext","The English grain aphid, Sitobion avenae (Fabricius), is one of the most important insect pests causing substantial yield losses in wheat production in China and other grain-growing areas in the world. The efficient utilization of wheat genes for resistance to English grain aphid (EGA) provides an efficient, economic and environmentally sound approach to reduce the yield losses. In the present study, the wheat line C273 (Triticum durum AABB, 2n = 4x = 28), is resistant to EGA in greenhouse and field tests. To identify the resistance gene, designated RA-1 temporarily, C273 was crossed with susceptible genotype Poland 305 (T. polonicum, AABB, 2n = 4x = 28). The F(1), F(2) and F(2:3) lines were tested with EGA in the field and greenhouse. The results indicated that RA-1 is a single dominant gene, closely linked to the microsatellite markers (SSR) Xwmc179, Xwmc553 and Xwmc201 on chromosome 6AL at genetic distances of 3.47, 4.73 and 7.57 cM, respectively. The three SSR markers will be valuable in marker-assisted selection for resistance to EGA as well as for cloning this gene in the future."

Its electrophoretic mobility and molecular weight were similar to those of 1By16 and was designated as 1By16*. The complete coding sequence of the 1By16* gene isolated by allelic-specific polymerase chain reaction (AS-PCR) consists of 2,157 bp, encoding 729 amino acid residues. The real presence and authenticity of the 1By16* gene in KU1952 were further confirmed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), heterologous expression and Western blotting. The molecular structure as well as phylogenetic analysis revealed that 1By16* had 21 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variations and possessed greater similarity with superior quality subunits 1By15 and 1By16 of common wheat. Secondary structure prediction displayed higher α-helix and β-strand contents in the 1By16* subunit, which could form a superior gluten structure and, consequently, might have positive effects on dough quality. Our results suggest that 1By16* is expected to be a new potential gene for wheat quality improvement."

"19513805","abstracttext","The TaPR60 gene from bread wheat encodes a small cysteine-rich protein with a hydrophobic signal peptide, predicted to direct the TaPR60 protein to a secretory pathway. It was demonstrated by heterologous expression of recombinant TaPR60 protein that the signal peptide is recognized and cleaved in yeast cells. The full-length gene including promoter sequence of a TaPR60 orthologue was cloned from a BAC library of Triticum durum. A transcriptional promoter-GUS fusion was stably transformed into wheat, barley and rice. The strongest GUS expression in wheat and barley was found in the endosperm transfer cells, while in rice the promoter was active inside the starchy endosperm during the early stages of grain filling. The TaPR60 gene was also used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Five proteins were identified in the screen, and for some of these prey proteins, the interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. The signal peptide binding proteins, TaUbiL1 and TaUbiL2, are homologues of animal proteins, which belong to proteolytic complexes, and therefore may be responsible for TaPR60 processing or degradation of the signal peptide. Other proteins that interact with TaPR60 may have a function in TaPR60 secretion or regulation of this process. Examination of a three dimensional model of TaPR60 suggested that this protein could be involved in binding of lipidic molecules."

"28461720","abstracttext","Drought is considered one of the major constraints of plant growth and productivity worldwide. Plants respond to drought through different mechanisms including physiological, biochemical, and gene expression modulation. Studying these mechanisms will provide better understanding of drought response mechanisms and will help breeders in developing new cultivars. In this study, growth, biochemical, and molecular responses of four wheat ( Triticum durum Desf.) landraces to drought stress (300 mM mannitol) were investigated at the seedling stage. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to assess gene expression level for a drought stress responsive gene ( DHN15.1 ). Germination percentage, shoot length, root length, and root number for all T. durum landraces were decreased significantly under drought stress. However, drought stress caused an increase in proline content, lipid peroxidation level, and DHN15.1 transcript level. According to the studied traits, the Karak landrace showed long shoots (48% relative to its control), the longest roots (45% relative to its control) and the highest proline content (483% relative to its control). The results indicate that from the landraces studied, Karak may be selected as the most tolerant wheat landrace and may help in wheat breeding programs for adaptation to drought-prone environments."

"11973318","abstracttext","We analyzed the events that affect gene structure and expression in the early stages of allopolyploidy in wheat. The transcriptome response was studied by analyzing 3072 transcripts in the first generation of a synthetic allotetraploid (genome S(l)S(l)A(m)A(m)), which resembles tetraploid wheat (genome BBAA), and in its two diploid progenitors Aegilops sharonensis (S(l)S(l)) and Triticum monococcum ssp. aegilopoides (A(m)A(m)). The expression of 60 out of 3072 transcripts was reproducibly altered in the allotetraploid: 48 transcripts disappeared and 12 were activated. Transcript disappearance was caused by gene silencing or by gene loss. Gene silencing affected one or both homeologous loci and was associated in part with cytosine methylation. Gene loss or methylation had occurred already in the F(1) intergeneric hybrid or in the allotetraploid, depending on the locus. The silenced/lost genes included rRNA genes and genes involved in metabolism, disease resistance, and cell cycle regulation. The activated genes with a known function were all retroelements. These findings show that wide hybridization and chromosome doubling affect gene expression via genetic and epigenetic alterations immediately upon allopolyploid formation. These events contribute to the genetic diploidization of newly formed allopolyploids."
"21652489","articletitle","The {beta}-amylase genes of grasses and a phylogenetic analysis of the Triticeae (Poaceae)."
"21652489","abstracttext","There are two forms of β-amylase in the Triticeae crop plants wheat, barley, and rye: an endosperm-specific form encoded by two or three closely linked genes, and a tissue-ubiquitous form encoded by a single gene. Both rice and corn have one ubiquitously expressed form encoded by a single gene. This study focuses on two phylogenetic analyses of β-amylase gene sequences. First, a phylogenetic analysis of coding sequences from wheat, barley, rye, rice, and corn was expected to clarify the relationship between the endosperm-specific and tissue-ubiquitous forms of the protein. Instead, it illustrates possible effects of distant outgroups, based on conflicting patterns of character state variation consistent with different root positions. Next, a broad sample of the monogenomic Triticeae was included in a phylogenetic analysis based on sequences from a portion of the tissue-ubiquitous β-amylase gene. The results were compared to existing Triticeae gene trees, among which extensive conflict had been noted in the past. One additional gene tree has not completely clarified the complexity of the group, but has shed additional light on reticulate phylogenetic patterns within the tribe, including relationships involving Eremopyrum, Thinopyrum, and the Triticum/Aegilops group."

"30754365","abstracttext","Maize (Zea mays) has become an important crop in Poland with a constant increase in crop acreage since the 1990s. In 2007, maize plants with characteristic leaf mosaic were observed in two locations in the Wielkopolska Region near Poznań and Krotoszyn. Ninety-two samples from plants showing leaf mosaic, some leaf discoloration, stunting, or no symptoms were collected and tested for Maize dwarf mosaic virus (MDMV) and Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) by double-antibody sandwich (DAS)-ELISA (Bioreba, Basel, Switzerland). SCMV was detected only in three samples with distinct leave mosaic symptoms. Electron microscopy of leaf extracts revealed numerous potyvirus-like particles. Immuno-specific electron microscopy (ISEM) with the SCMV antiserum gave positive results for all three samples. Each virus isolate was propagated by mechanical inoculation on five varieties of dent maize and three varieties of sweet maize, cockspur grass (Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) Beauv.), crab grass (Digitaria sanguinalis (L.) Scop.), and green bristle-grass (Setaria viridis (L.) P.B.). Leaf mosaic appeared 4 to 5 days postinoculation. ELISA detected all three isolates in the symptomless hosts of oat (Avena sativa L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and triticale (Triticale). The three isolates induced local leaf necrosis on sorghum (Sorghum vulgare L.), in which the virus occurred in low concentrations as determined by ELISA so infections of sorghum plants were confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR) with primers PS/PSC (1). Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), true millet (Panicum miliaceum L.), and wind grass (Agrostis spica-venti (L.) P.B.) were not susceptible (2). Using the total RNA extracted with the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) from leaves of inoculated maize plants, a one step RT-PCR (Qiagen) amplified a ~800-bp cDNA fragment of the coat protein gene with SCMV-specific primers PS/PSC (1). Six cDNA clones were sequenced for each isolate. Nucleotide sequences of the 823-bp cDNA clones of isolates SCMV-P1 and P2 (GenBank Accession Nos. EU761241 and EU761242, respectively) were 99% identical and each was 92% identical to the sequence of SCMV-P3 (FJ376609). The clones of SCMV-P1 and SCMV-P2 shared 99, 98, 90, and 87% nucleotide sequence identity with two German SCMV isolates (X981697 and X98168), a Spanish isolate (AM110759), the UT6 isolate from Thailand (AY630923), and the Nancheng isolate (EU346720) from China, respectively. The SCMV-P3 sequence was 98, 94, 92, 89, and 92% identical to the Mx isolate from Mexico (AY195610), a Bulgarian SCMV isolate (AJ006201), the German Seehausen (X98166) and Borsdorf (X98167) isolates, the SC-UD1 (DQ647661), the KL - Co86032 (DQ866744) isolates from Thailand and India, and the Chinese Nanchang (EU346720) and Pengze2 (EU346718) isolates, respectively. In 2008, SCMV was again detected by ELISA in mixed infections with MDMV in samples from the Wielkopolska Region, but only sporadically, and the virus is considered not to be important economically in maize production in Poland.

"10791814","abstracttext","Three genes encoding granule-bound starch synthase (wx-TmA, wx-TsB, and wx-TtD) have been isolated from Triticum monococcum (AA), and Triticum speltoides (BB), by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach, and from Triticum tauschii (DD), by screening a genomic DNA library. Multiple sequence alignment indicated that the wx-TmA, wx-TsB, and wx-TtD genes had the same extron and (or) intron structure as the previously reported waxy gene from barley. The lengths of the three wx-TmA, wx-TsB, and wx-TtD genes were 2834 bp, 2826 bp, and 2893 bp, respectively, each covering 31 bp in the untranslated leader and the entire coding region consisting of 11 exons and 10 introns. The three genes had identical lengths of exons, except exonl, and shared over 95% identity with each other within the exon regions. The majority of introns were significantly variable in length and sequence, differing mainly in length (1-57 bp) as a result of insertion and (or) deletion events. The deduced amino acid sequence from these three genes indicated that the mature WX-TMA, -TSB, and -TTD proteins contained the same number of amino acids, but differed in predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point (pI) due to amino acid substitutions (13-18). The predicted physical characteristics of the WX proteins matched the respective proteins in wheat very closely, but the match was not perfect. Furthermore the exon5 sequences of the wx-TmA, wx-TsB, and wx-TtD genes were different from a cDNA encoding a waxy gene of common wheat previously reported. The striking difference was that an insertion of 11 amino acids occurred in the cDNA sequence that could not be observed in the exons of the A, B, and D genes. It was noted, however, that the 3' end of intron4 of these genes could account for the additional 11 amino acids. The sequence information from the available waxy genes identified the intron4-exon5-intron5 region as being diagnostic for sequence variation in waxy. The sequence variation in the waxy genes provides the basis for primer design to distinguish the respective genes in common wheat, and its progenitors, using PCR."

"29143603","abstracttext_background","The key gene in genetic system controlling the duration of the vegetative period in cereals is the VRN1 gene, whose product under the influence of low temperature (vernalization) promotes the transition of the apical meristem cells into a competent state for the development of generative tissues of spike. As early genetic studies shown, the dominant alleles of this gene underlie the spring forms of plants that do not require vernalization for this transition. In wheat allopolyploids various combinations of alleles of the VRN1 homoeologous loci (VRN1 homoeoalleles) provide diversity in such important traits as the time to heading, height of plants and yield. Due to genetical mapping of VRN1 loci it became possible to isolate the dominant VRN1 alleles and to study their molecular structure compared with the recessive alleles defining the winter type of plants. Of special interest is the process of divergence of VRN1 loci in the course of evolution from diploid ancestors to wheat allopolyploids of different levels of ploidy."
"29143603","abstracttext_results","Molecular analysis of VRN1 loci allowed to establish that various dominant alleles of these loci appeared as a result of mutations in two main regulatory regions: the promoter and the first intron. In the diploid ancestors of wheat, especially, in those of A- genome (T. boeoticum, T. urartu), the dominant VRN1 alleles are rare in accordance with a limited distribution of spring forms in these species. In the first allotetraploid wheat species including T. dicoccoides, T. araraticum (T. timopheevii), the spring forms were associated with a new dominant alleles, mainly, within the VRN-A1 locus. The process of accumulation of new dominant alleles at all VRN1 loci was significantly accelerated in cultivated wheat species, especially in common, hexaploid wheat T. aestivum, as a result of artificial selection of spring forms adapted to different climatic conditions and containing various combinations of VRN1 homoeoalleles."

The chromosome pairing between H. chilense and wheat chromosomes is very low (if existing) even in the absence of the action of the Ph1 gene. Nevertheless, translocation between H. chilense and wheat chromosomes has been observed frequently in genomic combinations where univalents of both species are present and therefore a method is available for using H. chilense in wheat or triticale breeding. Hybrids and amphiploids with other crop species of the Triticeae, such as rye or barley, have also been obtained, although to date the production of stable introgression stocks has not been completed. The technique of chromosome painting, using both high- and low-repeated DNA sequences in combination with genomic in situ hybridization have been used as effective methods for basic cytogenetic research in H. chilense, allowing analysis of genome evolution, and monitoring H. chilense chromosomes in interspecific hybridization breeding programs."

"19104838","abstracttext","The celiac disease (CD) is an inflammatory condition characterized by injury to the lining of the small-intestine on exposure to the gluten of wheat, barley and rye. The involvement of gluten in the CD syndrome has been studied in detail in bread wheat, where a set of ""toxic"" and ""immunogenic"" peptides has been defined. For wheat diploid species, information on CD epitopes is poor. In the present paper, we have adopted a genomic approach in order to understand the potential CD danger represented by storage proteins in diploid wheat and sequenced a sufficiently large number of cDNA clones related to storage protein genes of Triticum monococcum. Four bona fide toxic peptides and 13 immunogenic peptides were found. All the classes of storage proteins were shown to contain harmful sequences. The major conclusion is that einkorn has the full potential to induce the CD syndrome, as already evident for polyploid wheats. In addition, a complete overview of the storage protein gene arsenal in T. monococcum is provided, including a full-length HMW x-type sequence and two partial HMW y-type sequences."

"17066822","abstracttext","The Russian wheat aphid, Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov) (Homoptera: Aphididae), is one of the most devastating insect pests of wheat (Triticum spp.) and barley (Hordeum spp.) in the world. Yield losses and control costs are valued at several hundred million dollars each year. The use of D. noxia-resistant cultivars is an ecologically, economically, and biologically sound method of managing this pest. Several D. noxia resistance (Dn) genes from wheat have been used to develop cultivars resistant to D. noxia. However, a new U.S. D. noxia biotype (biotype 2) in Colorado is virulent to all known Dn genes except the Dn7 gene from rye (Secale spp.). Hence, there is an immediate need to identify and characterize unique sources of D. noxia resistance to biotypes. In this article, we report resistance to D. noxia biotype 2, identified in a selection from wheat cereal introduction (CItr) 2401, that is controlled by two dominant genes. CItr2401 has a strong antibiosis effect that is exhibited as a reduced intrinsic rate of increase of D. noxia biotype 2. CItr2401 plants also exhibit tolerance to leaf rolling and chlorosis. No antixenosis was detected in CItr2401."

Application of C-banding, in situ hybridization and molecular markers analysis showed that LF24 was a wheat S. africanum 2R(a)(2D) substitution line. When inoculated with stripe rust isolates, T. durum and MY11 were highly susceptible, while S. africanum, YF and LF24 were immune. It is confirmed through molecular cytogenetic analysis that the stripe rust resistance of LF24 was derived from S. africanum chromosome 2R(a). We compared the banding patterns and disease resistance of reported chromosomes 2R from different S. cereale introduced into wheat background, and found that there was new stripe rust resistance gene(s) on S. africanum 2R(a). LF24 is a new substitution line which can be used as stripe rust resistant source in wheat improvement."

"22570075","abstracttext","To elucidate some of the molecular mechanisms involved in genome differentiation and evolution of cultivated wheats, we compared orthologous genes encoding starch branching enzyme IIa (SBEIIa). Bread wheat is an allohexaploid species comprising the three genomes A, B and D, each of which contributes a copy of the SBEIIa gene, involved in starch biosynthesis and known to control important quality traits related to technological and nutritional value of wheat-based food products. Alignment of the nucleotide sequences of these three genes revealed variation, both at the level of single nucleotides and indels. Multiple transposon elements were identified in the intragenic regions, some of which appear to have inserted before the divergence of the wheat diploid genomes. The B genome homoeologue was the most divergent of the three genes. Two MITE transposon insertions were detected within the intronic sequence of SBEIIa-B and two other transposons within SBEIIa-D. The presence/absence of these transposons in a panel of diploid and polyploid Triticum and Aegilops species provided some insights into the phylogeny of wheat."

"19319504","abstracttext","The yellow pigment (YP) of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var durum) semolina is due in part to the presence of carotenoid pigments found in the endosperm and is an important end-use quality trait. Phytoene synthase (Psy) is considered a rate-limiting enzyme in the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway and in this study, three alleles of Psy1-A1 were sequenced from four durum wheat cultivars and a co-dominant marker was developed for genetic mapping. Psy1-A1 mapped to chromosome 7AL near Xwmc809 in three durum mapping populations and was significantly associated with a pigment quantitative trait loci (QTL) identified on that chromosome. A second QTL localized 25 cM proximal to Psy1-A1 in two populations, and the interaction between the two QTL was not significant. Consistent with QTL mapping data, the Psy1-A1o allele was associated with elevated pigment in a validation population comprising 93 diverse cultivars and breeding lines. These results confirm an earlier hypothesis that Psy1, and at least one additional gene in the distal region of 7AL, are associated with grain YP differences in durum wheat. The functional co-dominant marker developed in this study differentiates the Psy1-A1 alleles reported here and could be used as a target to enhance YP selection in durum wheat breeding programs."

Gene expression in developing caryopses at 21 days post-anthesis (DPA) was profiled using the Affymetrix Wheat GeneChip. Four of 105 transcripts which were significantly upregulated by nitrogen level were annotated as γ-3 hordein and the identification of corresponding expressed sequence tags showed that they differed in sequence from previously described (typical) γ-gliadins and represented a novel form of γ-gliadin. Real-time reverse transcriptase PCR at 14, 21, 28 and 35 DPA revealed that this transcript was most abundant and most responsive to nitrogen at 21 DPA. Four novel γ-gliadin genes were isolated by PCR amplification from wheat cv. Hereward and the related species Aegilops tauschii and Triticum monococcum while three were assembled from the genomic sequence database of wheat cv. Chinese Spring (www.cerealsdb.uk.net). Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the seven genes showed that they shared only 44.4-46.0% identity with the sequence of a typical γ-gliadin (accession number EF15018), but 61.8-68.3% identity with the sequence of γ-3 hordein from the wild barley species Hordeum chilense (AY338065). The novel γ-gliadin genes were localized to the group 1 chromosomes (1A, 1B, 1D)."

Morphologically, tritordeum resembles the wheat parent, showing promise for agriculture and wheat breeding. Start Codon Targeted (SCoT) polymorphism is a recently developed technique that generates gene-targeted markers. Thus, we considered it interesting to evaluate its potential for the DNA fingerprinting of newly synthesized hexaploid tritordeums and their respective parents. In this study, 60 SCoT primers were tested, and 18 and 19 of them revealed SCoT polymorphisms in the newly synthesized tritordeum lines HT27 and HT22, respectively, and their parents. An analysis of the presence/absence of bands among tritordeums and their parents revealed three types of polymorphic markers: (i) shared by tritordeums and one of their parents, (ii) exclusively amplified in tritordeums, and (iii) exclusively amplified in the parents. No polymorphism was detected among individuals of each parental species. Three SCoT markers were exclusively amplified in tritordeums of lines HT22 and HT27, being considered as polyploidization-induced rearrangements. About 70% of the SCoT markers of H. chilense origin were not transmitted to the allopolyploids of both lines, and most of the SCoTs scored in the newly synthesized allopolyploids originated from wheat, reinforcing the potential use of tritordeum as an alternative crop."

"23970079","abstracttext","Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon PI94668 and PI349045 were identified as containing null alleles at Glu-A1 and Glu-B1 loci in previous investigation. Sequencing of the respective HMW-GS genes Ax, Bx, Ay and By in both accessions indicated equal DNA lengths with gene silencing caused by 1 to 4 in-frame stop codon(s) in the open reading frames. Six synthetic hexaploid wheat lines were produced by crossing PI94668 or PI349045 with six Aegilops tauschii by spontaneous chromosome doubling of unreduced gametes. As expected, these amphiploids had three different HMW-GS: Dx 3.1(t) + Dy11(*t), Dx2.1(t) +10(t) and Dx2(t) +Dy12(t) in Glu-D1 but double nulls in Glu-A1 and Glu-B1. Quality tests showed that most quality parameters in two T. turgidum ssp. dicoccon parents were very low due to the lack of HMW-GSs. However, incorporation of HMW-GS from Ae. tauschii in six synthetic hexaploid wheat lines significantly increased most quality related parameters. The potential values of these wheat lines in improving the quality of wheat are discussed."

Using these nucleus-cytoplasm hybrids, the distribution of the variegation-inducing cytoplasms was investigated. The variegation was maternally inherited, and was found to be temperature-dependent; it was expressed only at low temperatures, accompanied by a remarkable reduction in the content of chlorophyll a and b, and recovered to almost normal level in a greenhouse kept at 25 °C. The variegation was expressed only by special combinations of the wheat nuclei and alien cytoplasms; nine common wheat nuclei, Tve, P168, CS, N26, Slm, Sk, S615, Sphr, and Splt, and six cytoplasms, T. boeoticum, Ae. umbellulata, Ae. triuncialis, Ae. biuncialis, Ae. columaris, and Ae. triaristata 6x, expressed weak to strong variegation in almost all combinations. Combinations of three common wheat nuclei (JF , Comp and Macha) and 17 other cytoplasms showed no variegation: JF , Comp and Macha appeared to have a sort of restoring gene(s) against variegation. Since distribution of the variegation-inducing cytoplasms was confined to the A and C(u) type plasmas, it was assumed that the plasmagene(s) responsible for the variegation originated in the diploid level and was transmitted from Ae. umbellulata to three tetraploid and one hexaploid species of Polyeides section through the process of amphidiploidization."

"28587281","abstracttext","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenous small noncoding RNAs which regulate diverse molecular and biochemical processes at a post-transcriptional level in plants. As the ancestor of domesticated wheat, wild emmer wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides ) has great genetic potential for wheat improvement. However, little is known about miRNAs and their functions on salinity stress in wild emmer. To obtain more information on miRNAs in wild emmer, we systematically investigated and characterized the salinity-responsive miRNAs using deep sequencing technology. A total of 88 conserved and 124 novel miRNAs were identified, of which 50 were proven to be salinity-responsive miRNAs, with 32 significantly up-regulated and 18 down-regulated. miR172b and miR1120a, as well as mi393a, were the most significantly differently expressed. Targets of these miRNAs were computationally predicted, then Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis found that the targets of salinity-responsive miRNAs were enriched in transcription factors and stress-related proteins. Finally, we investigated the expression profiles of seven miRNAs ranging between salt-tolerant and sensitive genotypes, and found that they played critical roles in salinity tolerance in wild emmer. Our results systematically identified the salinity-responsive miRNAs in wild emmer, not only enriching the miRNA resource but also laying the foundation for further study on the biological functions and evolution of miRNAs in wild wheat and beyond."

Development of resistant varieties is hampered by lack of effective resistance sources in the tetraploid wheat primary gene pool. Here we dissected the genetic basis of resistance in a new durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum ) Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) population obtained by crossing an hexaploid resistant line and a durum susceptible cultivar. A total of 135 RILs were used for constituting a genetic linkage map and mapping loci for head blight incidence, severity, and disease-related plant morphological traits (plant height, spike compactness, and awn length). The new genetic map accounted for 4,366 single nucleotide polymorphism markers assembled in 52 linkage groups covering a total length of 4,227.37 cM. Major quantitative trait loci (QTL) for scab incidence and severity were mapped on chromosomes 2AS, 3AL, and 2AS, 2BS, 4BL, respectively. Plant height loci were identified on 3A, 3B, and 4B, while major QTL for ear compactness were found on 4A, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 7A. In this work, resistance to Fusarium was transferred from hexaploid to durum wheat, and correlations between the disease and morphological traits were assessed."

"30974226","abstracttext","Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread soil contaminant that readily accumulates in wheat, and posing a potential threat to human health. Our aim is to investigate Cd toxicity effect and molecular mechanisms for wheat. In this study, the physiological indexes, morphology, and gene expression patterns of diploid wheat (Triticum urartu) seedlings were evaluated after 2 and 5 d of a Cd treatment (10 μM CdSO 4 ). The Cd treatment resulted in increased proline and glutathione contents in shoots and roots, slight damage to leaf tips, severe damage to root tips, and increased root secretions. Transcriptome analysis showed that there were significantly more differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in shoots and roots after 5 d of Cd stress than after 2 d of Cd stress, and the DEGs of the shoots were more different than the roots. A Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis indicated that the pathways enriched under Cd treatment were ""DNA replication"" and ""phenylpropanoid biosynthesis"". These findings provide information about the responses to Cd stress in wheat, and provide a theoretical basis for reducing Cd toxicity and protecting food safety."

"30127797","abstracttext","Triticale (× Triticosecale Wittmack) is a man-made species developed by crossing wheat ( Triticum spp.) and rye ( Secale cereale L.). It incorporates favorable alleles from both progenitor species (wheat and rye), enabling adaptation to environments that are less favorable for wheat yet providing better biomass yield and forage quality. Triticale has huge potential for both grain and forage production, though research to improve the crop for better adaptation and grain quality is lagging behind that of other small grains. It is also gaining popularity as a cover crop to improve soil health and reduce nutrient leaching. Because of its genetic and flower structure, triticale is suitable for both line and hybrid breeding methods. Advances in the areas of molecular biology and the wealth of genomic resources from both wheat and rye can be exploited for triticale improvement. Gene mapping and genomic selection will facilitate triticale breeding by increasing selection precision and reducing time and cost. The objectives of this review are to summarize current triticale production status, breeding, and genetics research achievements and to highlight gaps for future research."

"32927153","abstracttext","Wheat is one of the most important food crops in the world for human consumption, like all plants it is exposed to environmental stresses including high temperatures. The deleterious effect of high temperatures negatively affects plant growth and development, leading to reduced viability and yield. These effects can be reduced by improvement of thermotolerance through innovative breeding strategies, based on the expansion of the genetic pool available, by exploring important genetic functions from wheat wild progenitors. Improving the genetic thermotolerance characteristics of wheat requires greater understanding of genetic bases of thermotolerance, through identification of high temperature stress related genes. A good source of new useful alleles is given by Aegilops species characterized by thermotolerant habits. In this study we have classified as thermotolerant or thermosensitive, on the basis of physiologic tests, some accessions of wheat wild relative species belonging to Aegilops and Triticum genera. A thermotolerant accession of Aegilops umbellulata (AUM5) was selected, subjected to different thermal treatments and analyzed at transcriptional level. By differential display reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (DDRT-PCR), we investigated modulation of gene expression elicited by heat treatments. This approach allowed the identification of various transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) produced by AUM5 in response to different thermal treatments. The functions of the inducible unique genes in the molecular determination of thermotolerance process are discussed."

By generating a range of interspecific hybrid lines, T. timopheevii can contribute to wheat's narrow gene-pool and be practically utilised in wheat breeding programmes. Previous studies that have generated such introgression lines between wheat and its wild relatives have been unable to use high-throughput methods to detect the presence of wild relative segments in such lines."
"31060503","abstracttext_results","A whole genome introgression approach, exploiting homoeologous recombination in the absence of the Ph1 locus, has resulted in the transfer of different chromosome segments from both the A t and G genomes of T. timopheevii into wheat.

The analysis of these interspecific hybrid lines has resulted in the detection of 276 putative unique introgressions from T. timopheevii, thereby allowing the generation of a genetic map of T. timopheevii containing 1582 SNP markers, spread across 14 linkage groups representing each of the seven chromosomes of the A t and G genomes of T. timopheevii. The genotyping of the hybrid lines was validated through fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH). Comparative analysis of the genetic map of T. timopheevii and the physical map of the hexaploid wheat genome showed that synteny between the two species is highly conserved at the macro-level and confirmed the presence of inter- and intra-genomic translocations within the A t and G genomes of T. timopheevii that have been previously only detected through cytological techniques."

The winter wheat cultivar Stigg is derived from a synthetic hexaploid wheat and contains introgressions from wild tetraploid wheat Triticum turgidum subsp. dicoccoides, which contribute to cv.

By comparison, cv. Stigg is apathetic in response to STB, and appears to fail to activate a range of defence pathways that cv. Longbow employs. Stigg also displays some evidence of sub-genome bias in its response to Z. tritici infection, whereas the susceptible cv.

"23052831","abstracttext","The polyploid nature of hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum, AABBDD) often represents a great challenge in various aspects of research including genetic mapping, map-based cloning of important genes, and sequencing and accurately assembly of its genome. To explore the utility of ancestral diploid species of polyploid wheat, sequence variation of T. urartu (A(u)A(u)) was analyzed by comparing its 277-kb large genomic region carrying the important Glu-1 locus with the homologous regions from the A genomes of the diploid T. monococcum (A(m)A(m)), tetraploid T. turgidum (AABB), and hexaploid T. aestivum (AABBDD). Our results revealed that in addition to a high degree of the gene collinearity, nested retroelement structures were also considerably conserved among the A(u) genome and the A genomes in polyploid wheats, suggesting that the majority of the repetitive sequences in the A genomes of polyploid wheats originated from the diploid A(u) genome. The difference in the compared region between A(u) and A is mainly caused by four differential TE insertion and two deletion events between these genomes. The estimated divergence time of A genomes calculated on nucleotide substitution rate in both shared TEs and collinear genes further supports the closer evolutionary relationship of A to A(u) than to A(m). The structure conservation in the repetitive regions promoted us to develop repeat junction markers based on the A(u) sequence for mapping the A genome in hexaploid wheat. Eighty percent of these repeat junction markers were successfully mapped to the corresponding region in hexaploid wheat, suggesting that T. urartu could serve as a useful resource for developing molecular markers for genetic and breeding studies in hexaploid wheat."

"21107782","abstracttext","Powdery mildew disease caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) is an economically important disease in wheat worldwide. The identification of germplasms resistant to the disease can not only facilitate the breeding of resistant cultivars, but can also broaden the diversity of resistance genes. The Mexican M53 is a synthetic hexaploid wheat line developed at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) from the cross between Triticum durum and Aegilops tauschii249. Infection of M53 with 15 different pathogen races revealed that the resistance in M53 was race-dependent and effective against the majority of the tested Bgt races, including the race 15 predominant in the Beijing wheat growing area. Inoculation of the parents of M53 with the race 15 demonstrated that M53 and Ae. tauschii249 were resistant, whereas T. durum was susceptible. The inoculation of three segregating F(2) populations developed from the crosses between M53 and three susceptible Chinese wheat cultivars with the race 15 showed that the resistant gene in M53 segregated in a single dominant manner. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were used to map the gene in a segregating F(2) population consisting of 213 lines developed from the cross Wan7107 × M53. Two closely linked AFLP markers, Apm109 and Apm161, were identified to flank the gene with genetic distances of 1.0 cM and 3.0 cM, respectively. The recognized gene was assigned to the long arm of chromosome 5D as determined by three linked SSR markers, Xwmc289b, Xgwm583, and Xgwm292, and by the physical mapping of Apm109 using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic and ditelosomic stocks.

Wheat powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, results in large yield losses worldwide. A high-density genetic linkage map of the powdery mildew resistance gene Pm41, originating from wild emmer (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) and previously mapped to the distal region of chromosome 3BL bin 0.63-1.00, was constructed using an F5:6 recombinant inbred line population derived from a cross of durum wheat cultivar Langdon and wild emmer accession IW2. By applying comparative genomics analyses, 19 polymorphic sequence-tagged site markers were developed and integrated into the Pm41 genetic linkage map. Ultimately, Pm41 was mapped in a 0.6 cM genetic interval flanked by markers XWGGC1505 and XWGGC1507, which correspond to 11.7, 19.2, and 24.9 kb orthologous genomic regions in Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum, respectively. The XWGGC1506 marker co-segregated with Pm41 and could be served as a starting point for chromosome landing and map-based cloning as well as marker-assisted selection of Pm41. Detailed comparative genomics analysis of the markers flanking the Pm41 locus in wheat and the putative orthologous genes in Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum suggests that the gene order is highly conserved between rice and sorghum. However, intra-chromosome inversions and re-arrangements are evident in the wheat and Brachypodium genomic regions, and gene duplications are also present in the orthologous genomic regions of Pm41 in wheat, indicating that the Brachypodium gene model can provide more useful information for wheat marker development."

Cloned genomic copies of various WDV isolates as well as mutants constructed in vitro were introduced into the protoplasts and assayed for their ability to replicate. As a result, regions of the WDV genome necessary or dispensable for the viral DNA replication could be defined. In addition, the gene encoding the viral capsid protein was replaced by three different bacterial marker genes, neomycin phosphotransferase, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, and beta-galactosidase. The beta-galactosidase gene doubled the size of the WDV genome. The replication of the recombinant WDV genomes and the expression of these genes were monitored in suspension culture cells of T. monococcum. The potential of replicative expression vectors based on the WDV genome is discussed."

"18944155","abstracttext","ABSTRACT Host species specificity of Magnaporthe grisea toward foxtail millet was analyzed using F(1) cultures derived from a cross between a Triticum isolate (pathogenic on wheat) and a Setaria isolate (pathogenic on foxtail millet). On foxtail millet cvs. Beni-awa and Oke-awa, avirulent and virulent cultures segregated in a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that a single locus is involved in the specificity. This locus was designated as Pfm1. On cv. Ki-awa, two loci were involved and one of them was Pfm1. The other locus was designated as Pfm2. Interestingly, Pfm1 was not involved in the pathogenic specificity on cv. Kariwano-zairai. These results suggest that there is no ""master gene"" that determines the pathogenic specificity on all foxtail millet cultivars and that the species specificity of M. grisea toward foxtail millet is governed by cultivar-dependent genetic mechanisms that are similar to gene-for-gene interactions controlling race-cultivar specificity."

"19935921","abstracttext","Levels of the heavy metal cadmium (Cd) in food products are a food safety concern. Grain Cd is higher in durum (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) than in common wheat, so reduction of Cd in durum grain is a priority of breeding programs. Previous research demonstrated that a single dominant gene, Cdu1, confers the low grain Cd phenotype, but the map location of the gene is not known. A doubled haploid population segregating for Cd concentration, developed from the cross of W9262-260D3 (a Kyle*2/Biodur inbred selection with low Cd uptake) and Kofa (high Cd uptake) and mapped with microsatellite markers, was used to locate Cdu1. Grain Cd concentration was determined by standard laboratory methods on field grain samples in 2000 and 2001. The Cd concentration segregated bimodally, allowing Cdu1 to be mapped qualitatively as well as quantitatively with quantitative trait locus analysis. The Cdu1 gene mapped to the long arm of chromosome 5B."

"26177065","abstracttext","Agrobacterium vitis, the causal agent of crown gall of grapevine, is a threat to viticulture worldwide. A major virulence factor of this pathogen is polygalacturonase, an enzyme that degrades pectin components of the xylem cell wall. A single gene encodes for the polygalacturonase gene. Disruption of the polygalacturonase gene results in a mutant that is less pathogenic and produces significantly fewer root lesions on grapevines. Thus, the identification of peptides or proteins that could inhibit the activity of polygalacturonase could be part of a strategy for the protection of plants against this pathogen. A phage-displayed combinatorial peptide library was used to isolate peptides with a high binding affinity to A. vitis polygalacturonase. These peptides showed sequence similarity to regions of Oryza sativa (EMS66324, Japonica) and Triticum urartu (NP_001054402, wild wheat) polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs). Furthermore, these panning experiments identified a peptide, SVTIHHLGGGS, which was able to reduce A. vitis polygalacturonase activity by 35% in vitro. Truncation studies showed that the IHHL motif alone is sufficient to inhibit A. vitis polygalacturonase activity."
"11768203","articletitle","Genotypic variation in tetraploid wheat affecting homoeologous pairing in hybrids with Aegilops peregrina."
"11768203","abstracttext","The Ph1 gene has long been considered the main factor responsible for the diploid-like meiotic behavior of polyploid wheat. This dominant gene, located on the long arm of chromosome 5B (5BL), suppresses pairing of homoeologous chromosomes in polyploid wheat and in their hybrids with related species. Here we report on the discovery of genotypic variation among tetraploid wheats in the control of homoeologous pairing. Compared with the level of homoeologous pairing in hybrids between Aegilops peregrina and the bread wheat cultivar Chinese Spring (CS), significantly higher levels of homoeologous pairing were obtained in hybrids between Ae. peregrina and CS substitution lines in which chromosome 5B of CS was replaced by either 5B of Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides line 09 (TTD09) or 5G of Triticum timopheevii ssp. timopheevii line 01 (TIMO1). Similarly, a higher level of homoeologous pairing was found in the hybrid between Ae. peregrina and a substitution line of CS in which chromosome arm 5BL of line TTD140 substituted for 5BL of CS. It appears that the observed effect on the level of pairing is exerted by chromosome arm 5BL of T turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, most probably by an allele of Ph1. Searching for variation in the control of homoeologous pairing among lines of wild tetraploid wheat, either T turgidum ssp. dicoccoides or T timopheevii ssp. armeniacum, showed that hybrids between Ae. peregrina and lines of these two wild wheats exhibited three different levels of homoeologous pairing: low, low intermediate, and high intermediate. The low-intermediate and high-intermediate genotypes may possess weak alleles of Ph1. The three different T turgidum ssp. dicoccoides pairing genotypes were collected from different geographical regions in Israel, indicating that this trait may have an adaptive value. The availability of allelic variation at the Ph1 locus may facilitate the mapping, tagging, and eventually the isolation of this important gene."

"25072699","abstracttext","Stem rust has become a renewed threat to global wheat production after the emergence and spread of race TTKSK (also known as Ug99) and related races from Africa. To elucidate U.S. winter wheat resistance genes to stem rust, association mapping was conducted using a panel of 137 lines from cooperative U.S. winter wheat nurseries from 2008 and simple sequence repeat (SSR) and sequence tagged site (STS) markers across the wheat genome. Seedling infection types were evaluated in a greenhouse experiment using six U.S. stem rust races (QFCSC, QTHJC, RCRSC, RKQQC, TPMKC and TTTTF) and TTKSK, and adult plant responses to bulked U.S. races were evaluated in a field experiment. A linearization algorithm was used to convert the qualitative Stakman scale seedling infection types for quantitative analysis. Association mapping successfully detected six known stem rust seedling resistance genes in U.S. winter wheat lines with frequencies: Sr6 (12%), Sr24 (9%), Sr31 (15%), Sr36 (9%), Sr38 (19%), and Sr1RSAmigo (8%). Adult plant resistance gene Sr2 was present in 4% of lines. SrTmp was postulated to be present in several hard winter wheat lines, but the frequency could not be accurately determined. Sr38 was the most prevalent Sr gene in both hard and soft winter wheat and was the most effective Sr gene in the adult plant field test. Resistance to TTKSK was associated with nine markers on chromosome 2B that were in linkage disequilibrium and all of the resistance was attributed to the Triticum timopheevii chromosome segment carrying Sr36. Potential novel rust resistance alleles were associated with markers Xwmc326-203 on 3BL, Xgwm160-195 and Xwmc313-225 on 4AL near Sr7, Xgwm495-182 on 4BL, Xwmc622-147 and Xgwm624-146 on 4DL, and Xgwm334-123 on 6AS near Sr8. Xwmc326-203 was associated with adult plant resistance to bulked U.S. races and Xgwm495-182 was associated with seedling resistance to TTKSK."

"25424506","abstracttext","Consensus linkage maps are important tools in crop genomics. We have assembled a high-density tetraploid wheat consensus map by integrating 13 data sets from independent biparental populations involving durum wheat cultivars (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum), cultivated emmer (T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum) and their ancestor (wild emmer, T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides). The consensus map harboured 30 144 markers (including 26 626 SNPs and 791 SSRs) half of which were present in at least two component maps. The final map spanned 2631 cM of all 14 durum wheat chromosomes and, differently from the individual component maps, all markers fell within the 14 linkage groups. Marker density per genetic distance unit peaked at centromeric regions, likely due to a combination of low recombination rate in the centromeric regions and even gene distribution along the chromosomes. Comparisons with bread wheat indicated fewer regions with recombination suppression, making this consensus map valuable for mapping in the A and B genomes of both durum and bread wheat. Sequence similarity analysis allowed us to relate mapped gene-derived SNPs to chromosome-specific transcripts. Dense patterns of homeologous relationships have been established between the A- and B-genome maps and between nonsyntenic homeologous chromosome regions as well, the latter tracing to ancient translocation events. The gene-based homeologous relationships are valuable to infer the map location of homeologs of target loci/QTLs. Because most SNP and SSR markers were previously mapped in bread wheat, this consensus map will facilitate a more effective integration and exploitation of genes and QTL for wheat breeding purposes."

"30710464","abstracttext","Stripe (yellow) rust, caused by the fungus Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), is a destructive disease of wheat spread globally. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides; WEW) is known as a source for novel Pst resistance genes (R-gene), but our knowledge on wheat-Pst co-evolution in natural populations is limited. Yr15 is a WEW (accession G25) gene, which confers a broad-spectrum resistance to Pst, and encodes a tandem kinase-pseudokinase protein designated as WTK1. Exon-intron comparisons of multiple WTK1 homoeologous and paralogous copies scattered in allopolyploid wheat genomes enabled us to develop functional molecular markers (FMMs), which were used for population genetic study. The functional allele (Wtk1) was absent in a worldwide collection of 513 wheat cultivars, except for 32 introgression lines with Yr15 from G25, as well as in 84% of the 382 tested WEW accessions collected across the Fertile Crescent. Yr15 was found to be distributed along a narrow axis from Mt Carmel to the Anti-Lebanon Mountains ridge, mostly at elevations above c. 500 m, where the climatic conditions are favorable for disease development, therefore providing insights on gene flow and host-parasite co-evolution in WEW natural habitats. Moreover, the worldwide absence of Wtk1 in cultivated wheat and in WEW natural populations from southeast Turkey, where wheat is believed to have been domesticated, proposes that Yr15 was rather left behind, than lost during domestication. Our results highlight the importance of conservation of WEW populations in their natural habitats for discovery of novel R-genes and studies of host-parasite co-evolution."

"32915283","abstracttext_key message","New powdery mildew resistance gene Pm68 was found in the terminal region of chromosome 2BS of Greek durum wheat TRI 1796. The co-segregated molecular markers could be used for MAS. Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum Desf.) is not only an important cereal crop for pasta making, but also a genetic resource for common wheat improvement. In the present study, a Greek durum wheat TRI 1796 was found to confer high resistance to all 22 tested isolates of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt). Inheritance study on the F 1 plants and the F 2 population derived from the cross TRI 1796/PI 584832 revealed that the resistance in TRI 1796 was controlled by a single dominant gene, herein designated Pm68. Using the bulked segregant RNA-Seq (BSR-Seq) analysis combined with molecular analysis, Pm68 was mapped to the terminal part of the short arm of chromosome 2B and flanked by markers Xdw04 and Xdw12/Xdw13 with genetic distances of 0.22 cM each. According to the reference genome of durum wheat cv. Svevo, the corresponding physical region spanned the Pm68 locus was about 1.78-Mb, in which a number of disease resistance-related genes were annotated. This study reports the new powdery mildew resistance gene Pm68 that would be a valuable resource for improvement of both common wheat and durum wheat. The co-segregated markers (Xdw05-Xdw11) developed here would be useful tools for marker-assisted selection (MAS) in breeding."

"28391694","abstracttext","To explore the distribution and quantity of toxic epitopes in α-gliadins from Aegilops tauschii, a total of 133 complete α-gliadin coding sequences were obtained, including 69 pseudogenes with at least one premature stop codon and 64 genes with complete open reading frames (ORFs). Plenty of deletions and single amino acid substitutions were found in the 4 celiac disease (CD) toxic epitope domains through multiple alignments, in which the sequence of DQ2.5-glia-α2 demonstrated the most significant changes. Interestingly, 7 of the 59 α-gliadins were free of any kind of intact CD toxic epitopes, providing potential gene resources for low CD toxicity breeding of common wheat. Analysis of the neighbor-joining tree demonstrates that 2 of the totally 7 α-gliadins cluster within the homologues of Triticum (A genome), and the other 5 group with those of Aegilops Sitopsis (B genome). This result implies that the 7 α-gliadin genes may be originated from the ancestor species of Ae. tauschii, evolved by the homoploid hybrid of Triticum and Aegilops Sitopsis. The remaining 52 α-gliadins form a separate clade from other homologues of A and B genomes, suggesting a recent rapid gene expansion by gene duplication associated with the species adaptation."

"15729401","abstracttext","An F4-derived F6 recombinant inbred line population (n = 148) of a cross between the durable stripe (yellow) rust (caused by Puccinia striiformis) and leaf (brown) rust (caused by Puccinia triticina) resistant cultivar, Triticum aestivum 'Cook', and susceptible genotype Avocet-YrA was phenotyped at several locations in Canada and Mexico under artificial epidemics of leaf or stripe rusts and genotyped using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) and microsatellite markers. Durable adult plant resistance to stripe and leaf rusts in 'Cook' is inherited quantitatively and was based on the additive interaction of linked and (or) pleiotropic slow-rusting genes Lr34 and Yr18 and the temperature-sensitive stripe rust resistance gene, YrCK, with additional genetic factors. Identified QTLs accounted for 18% to 31% of the phenotypic variation in leaf and stripe rust reactions, respectively. In accordance with the high phenotypic associations between leaf and stripe rust resistance, some of the identified QTLs appeared to be linked and (or) pleiotropic for both rusts across tests. Although a QTL was identified on chromosome 7D with significant effects on both rusts at some testing locations, it was not possible to refine the location of Lr34 or Yr18 because of the scarcity of markers in this region. The temperature-sensitive stripe rust resistance response, conditioned by the YrCK gene, significantly contributed to overall resistance to both rusts, indicating that this gene also had pleiotropic effects."

"18414912","abstracttext","Lrk (Lr10 receptor-like kinase) and Tak (Triticum aestivum kinase) belong to the receptor-like kinase (RLK) supergene family in higher plants. Three Lrk/Tak gene regions spanning greater than 600 kb were identified via a genome-wide survey of barley gene-rich BAC clones. Two Lrk/Tak gene clusters are positioned on barley chromosome 3 (3H) and another is localized on chromosome 5 (1H), with each Lrk and Tak open reading frame physically positioned in a back-to-back orientation. Thirteen new Lrk/Tak-like fragments were cloned from the two clusters on 3H and the single cluster on 1H, respectively, and compared phylogenetically with other grass Lrk/Tak-like genes, including a 280-kb Lrk/Tak cluster on rice chromosome 1S. Physically clustered Lrk/Tak-like genes always form monophyletic groups; this suggests that the primary mechanism of expansion of the Lrk/Tak RLK super family was by tandem duplication, of which most members were duplicated after speciation of the Poaceae. Cultivar-dependent transcript accumulation of some Lrk/Tak family members on 3H, as revealed via Barley1 GeneChip microarray analysis, is consistent with the hypothesis of subfunctionalization of Lrk/Tak members following tandem duplication."

"16895481","abstracttext","Five new genes belonging to the pathogenesis-related (PR) 4 family have been cloned and characterised in Triticum aestivum. Two full-length genes, named wPR4e and wPR4f-b, were isolated by library screening, demonstrating the presence of a small intron only in wPR4f-b. Two other PR4 genes (wPR4f-a and wPR4f-c) were isolated by PCR, showing very high sequence identity with wPR4f-b and constituting a new sub-family. Transcription start analysis was performed by RLM-RACE, leading to the isolation of a fifth gene, named wPR4g, that is highly homologous to wPR4e; both encode putative vacuolar PR4 proteins (Wheatwin7 and Wheatwin5, respectively). wPR4e and wPR4f sub-family genes are induced by F. culmorum infection, by chemicals that lead to systemic acquired resistance and by wounding, showing different spatial and temporal induction pathways. In silico analysis of the 5' untranslated regions of wPR4e and wPR4f-b revealed the presence of several abiotic and biotic stress-responsive elements. wPR4e and wPR4f-b putative promoters were fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene, and transient and stable expression assays demonstrated that both are able to drive expression of GUS. Characterisation of these new PR4 genes and particularly of their 5' untranslated regions, as well as the determination of their expression patterns, will contribute to our understanding of the responsiveness of this gene family to various stress conditions and of its role in plant defence."

"17541839","abstracttext","A novel gene encoding a MDR-like ABC transporter protein was cloned from Catharanthus roseus, a medicinal plant with more than 120 kinds of secondary metabolites, through rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). This gene (named as Crmdr1; GenBank accession no.: DQ660356) had a total length of 4395 bp with an open reading frame of 3801 bp, and encoded a predicted polypeptide of 1266 amino acids with a molecular weight of 137.1 kDa. The CrMDR1 protein shared 59.8, 62.5, 60.0 and 58.2% identity with other MDR proteins isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (AAD31576), Coptis japonica (CjMDR), Gossypium hirsutum (GhMDR) and Triticum aestivum (TaMDR) at amino acid level, respectively. Southern blot analysis showed that Crmdr1 was a low-copy gene. Expression pattern analysis revealed that Crmdr1 constitutively expressed in the root, stem and leaf, but with lower expression in leaf. The domains analysis showed that CrMDR1 protein possessed two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs) arranging in ""TMD1-NBD1-TMD2-NBD2"" direction, which is consistent with other MDR transporters. Within NBDs three characteristic motifs common to all ABC transporters, ""Walker A"", ""Walker B"" and C motif, were found. These results indicate that CrMDR1 is a MDR-like ABC transporter protein that may be involved in the transport and accumulation of secondary metabolites."

The occurrence of three paralogous gene pairs with unequal evolutionary rate suggested functional divergence. Phylogenetic analysis formed four distinct clades having conserved gene and protein architecture, and sub-cellular localization. The tertiary structure analysis revealed the presence of helices and coils, and residues involved in ligand binding. Transcriptional profiling of each TaAPX and TaAPX-R gene suggested their specific role during development and stress response. Modulated transcript expression and APX enzyme activity during various stress conditions indicated their role in stress response. Interaction analyses suggested their interaction with other genes, miRNAs and various legends.

"16136351","articletitle","Genetic characterization and molecular mapping of a Hessian fly-resistance gene transferred from T. turgidum ssp. dicoccum to common wheat."
"16136351","abstracttext","A gene (temporarily designated Hdic) conferring resistance to the Hessian fly (Hf) [Mayetiola destructor (Say)] was previously identified from an accession of German cultivated emmer wheat [Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum (Schrank ex Schübler) Thell] PI 94641, and was transferred to the Hf-resistant wheat germplasm KS99WGRC42. The inheritance of Hdic resistance exhibited incomplete penetrance because phenotypes of some heterozygous progenies are fully resistant and the others are fully susceptible. Five simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers (Xgwm136,Xcfa2153, Xpsp2999,Xgwm33, and Xbarc263) were linked to the Hdic gene on the short arm of wheat chromosome 1A in the same region as the H9, H10, and H11 loci. Flanking markers Xgwm33 and Xcfa2153 were mapped at distances 0.6 cM proximal and 1.4 cM distal, respectively. Marker analysis revealed that a very small intercalary chromosomal segment containing Hdic was transferred from emmer wheat to KS99WGRC42. This is the first emmer-derived Hf-resistance gene that has been mapped and characterized. The Hdic gene confers a high level of antibiosis to biotypes GP and L, as well as to strains vH9 and vH13 of the Hf, which is different from the biotype reaction patterns of the known Hf-resistance genes on chromosome 1A (H5 and H11 susceptible to biotype L, H9 and H10 susceptible to strain vH9). These results suggested that Hdic is either a new gene or a novel allele of a known H gene on chromosome 1A. The broad spectrum of resistance conferred by the Hdic gene makes it valuable for developing Hf resistant wheat cultivars."

"22665189","abstracttext","The objective of this work was to develop a marker for the adult plant leaf rust resistance gene Lr35. The Lr35 gene was originally introgressed into chromosome 2B from Triticum speltoides, a diploid relative of wheat. A segregating population of 96 F( 2 )plants derived from a cross between the resistant line ThatcherLr35 and the susceptible variety Frisal was analysed. Out of 80 RFLP probes previously mapped on wheat chromosome 2B, 51 detected a polymorphism between the parents of the cross. Three of them were completely linked with the resistance gene Lr35. The co-segregating probe BCD260 was converted into a PCR-based sequence-tagged-site (STS) marker. A set of 48 different breeding lines derived from several European breeding programs was tested with the STS marker. None of these lines has a donor for Lr35 in its pedigree and all of them reacted negatively with the STS marker. As no leaf rust races virulent on Lr35 have been found in different areas of the world, the STS marker for the Lr35 resistance gene is of great value to support the introgression of this gene in combination with other leaf rust (Lr) genes into breeding material by marker-assisted selection."

Allelic variation at the VRN3 gene makes a significant contribution to the adaptability of wheat to a wide range of environmental conditions. In the present study, the origin and distribution of the Vrn-B3a and Vrn-B3b alleles during the evolution of wheat were investigated. Analysis of 214 accessions of 11 polyploid wheat species from different eco-geographical areas found the Vrn-B3a and Vrn-B3b alleles in accessions of tetraploid wheat T. dicoccum from Russia and hexaploid wheat of T. spelta from Iran, respectively. DNA sequence analysis of an insertion in the Vrn-B3b promoter region identified a new family of non-autonomous transposable hAT elements that originated in T. urartu lineage. Publicly available whole genome sequence assemblies of 11 T. aestivum and T. durum varieties, as well as WGS of T. dicoccoides were used to investigate the phylogeny and distribution of the TEs inserted in the Vrn-B3a and Vrn-B3b promoter regions, to determine the origin of these alleles. Results showed that both Vrn-B3a and Vrn-B3b diverged during the domestication of wheat, in the T. dicoccum lineage. However, while Vrn-B3a is common in T. dicoccum and T. durum from Ukraine and Russia the Vrn-B3b allele likely has a more recent origin in hexaploid wheat from the Near East."

"25849991","abstracttext_background","Wheat (AABBDD, 2n = 6x = 42) is a major dietary component for many populations across the world. Bread-making quality of wheat is mainly determined by glutenin subunits, but it remains challenging to elucidate the composition and variation of low-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (LMW-GS) genes, the major components for glutenin subunits in hexaploid wheat. This problem, however, can be greatly simplified by characterizing the LMW-GS genes in Triticum urartu, the A-genome donor of hexaploid wheat. In the present study, we exploited the high-throughput molecular marker system, gene cloning, proteomic methods and molecular evolutionary genetic analysis to reveal the composition, variation, expression and evolution of LMW-GS genes in a T. urartu population from the Fertile Crescent region."
"25849991","abstracttext_results","Eight LMW-GS genes, including four m-type, one s-type and three i-type, were characterized in the T. urartu population. Six or seven genes, the highest number at the Glu-A3 locus, were detected in each accession. Three i-type genes, each containing more than six allelic variants, were tightly linked because of their co-segregation in every accession. Only 2-3 allelic variants were detected for each m- and s-type gene. The m-type gene, TuA3-385, for which homologs were previously characterized only at Glu-D3 locus in common wheat and Aegilops tauschii, was detected at Glu-A3 locus in T. urartu. TuA3-460 was the first s-type gene identified at Glu-A3 locus. Proteomic analysis showed 1-4 genes, mainly i-type, expressed in individual accessions. About 62% accessions had three active i-type genes, rather than one or two in common wheat. Southeastern Turkey might be the center of origin and diversity for T. urartu due to its abundance of LMW-GS genes/genotypes. Phylogenetic reconstruction demonstrated that the characterized T. urartu might be the direct donor of the Glu-A3 locus in common wheat varieties."
"25849991","abstracttext_conclusions","Compared with the Glu-A3 locus in common wheat, a large number of highly diverse LMW-GS genes and active genes were characterized in T. urartu, demonstrating that this progenitor might provide valuable genetic resources for LMW-GS genes to improve the quality of common wheat. The phylogenetic analysis provided molecular evidence and confirmed that T. urartu was the A-genome donor of hexaploid wheat."
"11439119","articletitle","Analysis of a contiguous 211 kb sequence in diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum L.) reveals multiple mechanisms of genome evolution."
"11439119","abstracttext","In plant species with large genomes such as wheat or barley, genome organization at the level of DNA sequence is largely unknown. The largest sequences that are publicly accessible so far from Triticeae genomes are two 60 kb and 66 kb intervals from barley. Here, we report on the analysis of a 211 kb contiguous DNA sequence from diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum L.). Five putative genes were identified, two of which show similarity to disease resistance genes. Three of the five genes are clustered in a 31 kb gene-enriched island while the two others are separated from the cluster and from each other by large stretches of repetitive DNA. About 70% of the contig is comprised of several classes of transposable elements. Ten different types of retrotransposons were identified, most of them forming a pattern of nested insertions similar to those found in maize and barley. Evidence was found for major deletion, insertion and duplication events within the analysed region, suggesting multiple mechanisms of genome evolution in addition to retrotransposon amplification. Seven types of foldback transposons, an element class previously not described for wheat genomes, were characterized. One such element was found to be closely associated with genes in several Triticeae species and may therefore be of use for the identification of gene-rich regions in these species."
"16200412","articletitle","The expression of several Cbf genes at the Fr-A2 locus is linked to frost resistance in wheat."
"16200412","abstracttext","The C-repeat binding factor (Cbf) gene family has been shown to have a critical role in the regulation of low-temperature stress response in Arabidopsis. In Triticum monococcum, a locus carrying a family of Cbf-like genes, orthologs of Arabidopsis Cbf genes, is tightly linked to the frost tolerance locus Fr-A ( m ) 2, representing candidates for the differences in frost tolerance mapped at this locus. In this work we show that several Cbf genes have dramatically different levels of induction after cold exposure in hexaploid wheat. The Cbf-transcription levels differ between substitution and single chromosome recombinant lines carrying different 5A chromosomes or chromosome segments of the chromosome 5A from frost-tolerant and frost-sensitive wheat varieties. When the expression of eight Cbf genes, previously mapped at the Fr-A2 locus was investigated with gene specific primers using real-time RT-PCR, three Cbf sequences (Cbf1A, Cbf1C, Cbf7) showed a significantly higher relative transcription level (more than fourfold change) in lines differing for the Fr-A2 region. Differences in Cbf expression were also associated with a variation in frost tolerance. These results suggest that the amount of some Cbf mRNAs might be a critical factor for determining the level of frost tolerance in wheat."
"16404644","articletitle","Multiple genetic pathways for seed shattering in the grasses."
"16404644","abstracttext","Shattering is an essential seed dispersal mechanism in wild species. It is believed that independent mutations at orthologous loci led to convergent domestication of cereal crops. To investigate genetic relationships of Triticeae shattering genes with those of other grasses, we mapped spike-, barrel- (B-type), and wedge-type (W-type) spikelet disarticulation genes in wheat and its wild relatives. The Br1 gene for W-type disarticulation was mapped to a region delimited by Xpsr598 and Xpsr1196 on the short arm of chromosomes 3A in Triticum timopheevii and 3S in Aegilops speltoides. The spike- and W-type disarticulation genes are allelic at Br1 in Ae. speltoides. The B-type disarticulation gene, designated as Br2, was mapped to an interval of 4.4 cM between Xmwg2013 and Xpsr170 on the long arm of chromosome 3D in Aegilops tauschii, the D-genome donor of common wheat. Therefore, B- and W-type disarticulations are governed by two different orthologous loci on group-3 chromosomes. Based on map position, orthologs of Br1 and Br2 were not detected in barley, maize, rice, and sorghum, indicating multiple genetic pathways for shattering in grasses. The implications of the mapping results are discussed with regard to the evolution of polyploid wheat and domestication of cereals."
"22656645","articletitle","Gall midges (Hessian flies) as plant pathogens."
"22656645","abstracttext","Gall midges constitute an important group of plant-parasitic insects. The Hessian fly (HF; Mayetiola destructor), the most investigated gall midge, was the first insect hypothesized to have a gene-for-gene interaction with its host plant, wheat (Triticum spp.). Recent investigations support that hypothesis. The minute larval mandibles appear to act in a manner that is analogous to nematode stylets and the haustoria of filamentous plant pathogens. Putative effector proteins are encoded by hundreds of genes and expressed in the HF larval salivary gland. Cultivar-specific resistance (R) genes mediate a highly localized plant reaction that prevents the survival of avirulent HF larvae. Fine-scale mapping of HF avirulence (Avr) genes provides further evidence of effector-triggered immunity (ETI) against HF in wheat. Taken together, these discoveries suggest that the HF, and other gall midges, may be considered biotrophic, or hemibiotrophic, plant pathogens, and they demonstrate the potential that the wheat-HF interaction has in the study of insect-induced plant gall formation."

"27152457","abstracttext","In plant cells, the manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) plays an elusive role in the response to oxidative stress. In this study, we describe the isolation and functional characterization of a novel Mn-SOD from durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. Durum), named TdMnSOD. Molecular phylogeny analysis showed that the durum TdMnSOD exhibited high amino acids sequence identity with other Mn-SOD plants. The three-dimensional structure showed that TdMnSOD forms a homotetramer and each subunit is composed of a predominantly α-helical N-terminal domain and a mixed α/β C-terminal domain. TdMnSOD gene expression analysis showed that this gene was induced by various abiotic stresses in durum wheat. The expression of TdMnSOD enhances tolerance of the transformed yeast cells to salt, osmotic, cold and H2O2-induced oxidative stresses. Moreover, the analysis of TdMnSOD transgenic Arabidopsis plants subjected to different environmental stresses revealed low H2O2 and high proline levels as compared to the wild-type plants. Compared with the non-transformed plants, an increase in the total SOD and two other antioxidant enzyme activities including catalase (CAT) and peroxidases (POD) was observed in the three transgenic lines subjected to abiotic stress. Taken together, these data provide evidence for the involvement of durum wheat TdMnSOD in tolerance to multiple abiotic stresses in crop plants."

"18301877","abstracttext","Polygalacturonase-inhibiting proteins (PGIPs) are leucine-rich repeat (LRR) proteins involved in plant defence. Wheat pgip genes have been isolated from the B (Tapgip1) and D (Tapgip2) genomes, and now we report the identification of pgip genes from the A genomes of wild and cultivated wheats. By Southern blots and sequence analysis of BAC clones we demonstrated that wheat contains a single copy pgip gene per genome and the one from the A genome, pgip3, is inactivated by the insertion of a long terminal repeat copia retrotranspon within the fourth LRR. We demonstrated also that this retrotransposon insertion is present in Triticum urartu and all the polyploidy wheats assayed, but is absent in T. monococcum (Tmpgip3), suggesting that this insertion took place after the divergence between T. monococcum and T. urartu, but before the formation of the polyploid wheats. We identified also two independent insertion events of new Class II transposable elements, Vacuna, belonging to the Mutator superfamily, that interrupted the Tdipgip1 gene of T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides. The occurrence of these transposons within the coding region of Tdipgip1 facilitated the mapping of the Pgip locus in the pericentric region of the short arm of chromosome group 7. We speculate that the inactivation of pgip genes are tolerated because of redundancy of PGIP activities in the wheat genome."

"17115129","abstracttext","Tillering is one of the most important agronomic traits in cereal crops because tiller number per plant determines the number of spikes or panicles per plant, a key component of grain yield and/or biomass. In order to characterize the underlying genetic variation for tillering, we have isolated mutants that are compromised in tillering ability using ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS)-based mutagenesis in diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum subsp. monococcum). The tillering mutant, tiller inhibition (tin3) produces only one main culm compared to the wild type with many tillers. The monoculm phenotype of tin3 is due to a single recessive mutation. Genetic and molecular mapping in an F(2) population of diploid wheat located the tin3 gene on the long arm of chromosome 3A(m). One codominant RFLP marker Xpsr1205 cosegregated with tin3 in the F(2) population. Physical mapping of PSR1205 in a set of Chinese Spring deletion lines of group-3 chromosomes placed the tin3 gene in the distal 10% of the long arm of chromosome 3A, which is a recombination-rich region in wheat. The implications of the mapping of tin3 on chromosome arm 3A(m)L are discussed with respect to putative orthologs of tin3 in the 3L colinear regions across various cereal genomes and other tillering traits in grasses."
"23284903","articletitle","A new class of wheat gliadin genes and proteins."
"23284903","abstracttext","The utility of mining DNA sequence data to understand the structure and expression of cereal prolamin genes is demonstrated by the identification of a new class of wheat prolamins. This previously unrecognized wheat prolamin class, given the name δ-gliadins, is the most direct ortholog of barley γ3-hordeins. Phylogenetic analysis shows that the orthologous δ-gliadins and γ3-hordeins form a distinct prolamin branch that existed separate from the γ-gliadins and γ-hordeins in an ancestral Triticeae prior to the branching of wheat and barley. The expressed δ-gliadins are encoded by a single gene in each of the hexaploid wheat genomes. This single δ-gliadin/γ3-hordein ortholog may be a general feature of the Triticeae tribe since examination of ESTs from three barley cultivars also confirms a single γ3-hordein gene. Analysis of ESTs and cDNAs shows that the genes are expressed in at least five hexaploid wheat cultivars in addition to diploids Triticum monococcum and Aegilops tauschii. The latter two sequences also allow assignment of the δ-gliadin genes to the A and D genomes, respectively, with the third sequence type assumed to be from the B genome. Two wheat cultivars for which there are sufficient ESTs show different patterns of expression, i.e., with cv Chinese Spring expressing the genes from the A and B genomes, while cv Recital has ESTs from the A and D genomes. Genomic sequences of Chinese Spring show that the D genome gene is inactivated by tandem premature stop codons. A fourth δ-gliadin sequence occurs in the D genome of both Chinese Spring and Ae. tauschii, but no ESTs match this sequence and limited genomic sequences indicates a pseudogene containing frame shifts and premature stop codons. Sequencing of BACs covering a 3 Mb region from Ae. tauschii locates the δ-gliadin gene to the complex Gli-1 plus Glu-3 region on chromosome 1."
"24657062","articletitle","Map-based analysis of the tenacious glume gene Tg-B1 of wild emmer and its role in wheat domestication."
"24657062","abstracttext","The domestication of wheat was instrumental in spawning the civilization of humankind, and it occurred through genetic mutations that gave rise to types with non-fragile rachises, soft glumes, and free-threshing seed. Wild emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides), the tetraploid AB-genome progenitor of domesticated wheat has genes that confer tenacious glumes (Tg) that underwent genetic mutations to give rise to free-threshing wheat. Here, we evaluated disomic substitution lines involving chromosomes 2A and 2B of wild emmer accessions substituted for homologous chromosomes in tetraploid and hexaploid backgrounds. The results suggested that both chromosomes 2A and 2B of wild emmer possess genes that inhibit threshability. A population of recombinant inbred lines derived from the tetraploid durum wheat variety Langdon crossed with a Langdon - T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides accession PI 481521 chromosome 2B disomic substitution line was used to develop a genetic linkage map of 2B, evaluate the genetics of threshability, and map the gene derived from PI 481521 that inhibited threshability. A 2BS linkage map comprised of 58 markers was developed, and markers delineated the gene to a 2.3 cM interval. Comparative analysis with maps containing the tenacious glume gene Tg-D1 on chromosome arm 2 DS from Aegilops tauschii, the D genome progenitor of hexaploid wheat, revealed that the gene inhibiting threshability in wild emmer was homoeologous to Tg-D1 and therefore designated Tg-B1. Comparative analysis with rice and Brachypodium distachyon indicated a high level of divergence and poorly conserved colinearity, particularly near the Tg-B1 locus. These results provide a foundation for further studies involving Tg-B1, which, together with Tg-D1, had profound influences on wheat domestication."

"30769407","abstracttext","Leaf rust resistance gene Lr9 was transferred to wheat from Triticum umbellulatum (1). In 1971, 4 years after cultivars with this gene were released in the United States, leaf rust races with virulence to Lr9 were detected. In Mexico, cultivars with Lr9 have not been released and leaf rust races with Lr9 virulence have not been detected. Resistance gene Lr25 was transferred to wheat from Rosen rye (1) and has been effective worldwide, but this gene has not been used commercially because of possible negative effects on yield (1). Rust samples collected at different locations in Nuevo Leon State of Mexico during the 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 wheat crop seasons were analyzed on seedlings of wheat leaf rust differentials in the greenhouse from single pustule isolates. The race nomenclature used is described in Singh (2). Among the races identified from this area, seven, MLJ/SP, TNM/JP, TLB/JP, TNM/KP, TNR/JP, TNB/JN, and TMB/JP, were virulent to both of these genes. Virulence to Lr9 and Lr25 were confirmed by repeating tests using Lr9 differentials 'RL6010' and 'McNair 701' and Transec and three other Lr25 wheat lines developed at CIMMYT, which carry Lr25. To our knowledge, this is the first confirmed report of virulence to Lr9 in Mexico and virulence to Lr25 in the world. These isolates are conserved at CIMMYT for future reference. References: (1) R.

"24821410","abstracttext_background","Triticum monococcum (2n) is a close ancestor of T. urartu, the A-genome progenitor of cultivated hexaploid wheat, and is therefore a useful model for the study of components regulating photomorphogenesis in diploid wheat. In order to develop genetic and genomic resources for such a study, we constructed genome-wide transcriptomes of two Triticum monococcum subspecies, the wild winter wheat T. monococcum ssp. aegilopoides (accession G3116) and the domesticated spring wheat T. monococcum ssp. monococcum (accession DV92) by generating de novo assemblies of RNA-Seq data derived from both etiolated and green seedlings."
"24821410","abstracttext_principal findings","The de novo transcriptome assemblies of DV92 and G3116 represent 120,911 and 117,969 transcripts, respectively. We successfully mapped ∼90% of these transcripts from each accession to barley and ∼95% of the transcripts to T. urartu genomes. However, only ∼77% transcripts mapped to the annotated barley genes and ∼85% transcripts mapped to the annotated T. urartu genes. Differential gene expression analyses revealed 22% more light up-regulated and 35% more light down-regulated transcripts in the G3116 transcriptome compared to DV92. The DV92 and G3116 mRNA sequence reads aligned against the reference barley genome led to the identification of ∼500,000 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and ∼22,000 simple sequence repeat (SSR) sites."

"23253213","abstracttext","The physical map of the hexaploid wheat chromosome 3B was screened using centromeric DNA probes. A 1.1-Mb region showing the highest number of positive bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones was fully sequenced and annotated, revealing that 96% of the DNA consisted of transposable elements, mainly long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons (88%). Estimation of the insertion time of the transposable elements revealed that CRW (also called Cereba) and Quinta are the youngest elements at the centromeres of common wheat (Triticum spp.) and its diploid ancestors, with Quinta being younger than CRW in both diploid and hexaploid wheats. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments revealed that both CRW and Quinta families are targeted by the centromere-specific histone H3 variant CENH3. Immuno colocalization of retroelements and CENH3 antibody indicated that a higher proportion of Quinta than CRWs was associated with CENH3, although CRWs were more abundant. Long arrays of satellite repeats were also identified in the wheat centromere regions, but they lost the ability to bind with CENH3. In addition to transposons, two functional genes and one pseudogene were identified. The gene density in the centromere appeared to be between three and four times lower than the average gene density of chromosome 3B. Comparisons with related grasses also indicated a loss of microcollinearity in this region. Finally, comparison of centromeric sequences of Aegilops tauschii (DD), Triticum boeoticum (AA) and hexaploid wheat revealed that the centromeres in both the polyploids and diploids are still undergoing dynamic changes, and that the new CRWs and Quintas may have undertaken the core role in kinetochore formation."
"17443011","articletitle","Grinding up wheat: a massive loss of nucleotide diversity since domestication."
"17443011","abstracttext","Several demographic and selective events occurred during the domestication of wheat from the allotetraploid wild emmer (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides). Cultivated wheat has since been affected by other historical events. We analyzed nucleotide diversity at 21 loci in a sample of 101 individuals representing 4 taxa corresponding to representative steps in the recent evolution of wheat (wild, domesticated, cultivated durum, and bread wheats) to unravel the evolutionary history of cultivated wheats and to quantify its impact on genetic diversity. Sequence relationships are consistent with a single domestication event and identify 2 genetically different groups of bread wheat. The wild group is not highly polymorphic, with only 212 polymorphic sites among the 21,720 bp sequenced, and, during domestication, diversity was further reduced in cultivated forms--by 69% in bread wheat and 84% in durum wheat--with considerable differences between loci, some retaining no polymorphism at all. Coalescent simulations were performed and compared with our data to estimate the intensity of the bottlenecks associated with domestication and subsequent selection. Based on our 21-locus analysis, the average intensity of domestication bottleneck was estimated at about 3--giving a population size for the domesticated form about one third that of wild dicoccoides. The most severe bottleneck, with an intensity of about 6, occurred in the evolution of durum wheat. We investigated whether some of the genes departed from the empirical distribution of most loci, suggesting that they might have been selected during domestication or breeding. We detected a departure from the null model of demographic bottleneck for the hypothetical gene HgA. However, the atypical pattern of polymorphism at this locus might reveal selection on the linked locus Gsp1A, which may affect grain softness--an important trait for end-use quality in wheat."
"27551888","articletitle","Temperature-Dependent Wsm1 and Wsm2 Gene-Specific Blockage of Viral Long-Distance Transport Provides Resistance to Wheat streak mosaic virus and Triticum mosaic virus in Wheat."
"27551888","abstracttext","Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) and Triticum mosaic virus (TriMV) are economically important viral pathogens of wheat. Wheat cvs. Mace, carrying the Wsm1 gene, is resistant to WSMV and TriMV, and Snowmass, with Wsm2, is resistant to WSMV. Viral resistance in both cultivars is temperature sensitive and is effective at 18°C or below but not at higher temperatures. The underlying mechanisms of viral resistance of Wsm1 and Wsm2, nonallelic single dominant genes, are not known. In this study, we found that fluorescent protein-tagged WSMV and TriMV elicited foci that were approximately similar in number and size at 18 and 24°C, on inoculated leaves of resistant and susceptible wheat cultivars. These data suggest that resistant wheat cultivars at 18°C facilitated efficient cell-to-cell movement. Additionally, WSMV and TriMV efficiently replicated in inoculated leaves of resistant wheat cultivars at 18°C but failed to establish systemic infection, suggesting that Wsm1- and Wsm2-mediated resistance debilitated viral long-distance transport. Furthermore, we found that neither virus was able to enter the leaf sheaths of inoculated leaves or crowns of resistant wheat cultivars at 18°C but both were able to do so at 24°C. Thus, wheat cvs. Mace and Snowmass provide resistance at the long-distance movement stage by specifically blocking virus entry into the vasculature. Taken together, these data suggest that both Wsm1 and Wsm2 genes similarly confer virus resistance by temperature-dependent impairment of viral long-distance movement."

"22384332","abstracttext","Sources of resistance to Fusarium head blight (FHB) in wheat are mostly restricted to Chinese hexaploid genotypes. The effort to incorporate the resistance from hexaploid wheat or wild relatives to cultivated durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum Desf.) have not been successful in providing resistance to the level of the donor parents. In this study, we used 171 BC(1)F(6) and 169 BC(1)F(7) lines derived from crossing of four Tunisian tetraploid sources of resistance (Tun7, Tun18, Tun34, Tun36) with durum cultivars 'Ben,' 'Maier,' 'Lebsock,' and 'Mountrail' for association studies. The Tun18 and Tun7 FHB resistances were found to be comparable to the best hexaploid wheat sources. A new significant QTL for FHB resistance was identified on the long arm of chromosome 5B (Qfhs.ndsu-5BL) with both association and classical QTL mapping analysis. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks extending up to 40 cM were evident in these populations. The linear mixed model considering the structure (Q or P) and the kinship matrix (K(T)) estimated by restricted maximum likelihood (REML) was identified as the best for association studies in a mixture of wheat populations from a breeding program. The results of association mapping analysis also demonstrated a region on the short arm of chromosome 3B as potentially linked to FHB resistance. This region is in proximity of major FHB resistance gene fhb1 reported in hexaploid wheat. A possibility of having susceptibility or suppressor of resistance gene(s) on durum wheat chromosome 2A was further confirmed in this material, explaining the problem in developing resistant genotypes without counter selection against this region."

"26260850","abstracttext_key message","A robust and diagnostic STS marker for stem rust resistance gene Sr47 was developed and validated for marker-assisted selection. Stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici, Pgt) resistance gene Sr47, originally transferred from Aegilops speltoides to durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum) line DAS15, confers a high level of resistance to Pgt race TTKSK (Ug99). Recently, the durum Rusty 5D(5B) substitution line was used to reduce the Ae. speltoides segment, and the resulting lines had Sr47 on small Ae. speltoides segments on wheat chromosome arm 2BL. The objective of this study was to develop a robust marker for marker-assisted selection of Sr47. A 200-kb segment of the Brachypodium distachyon genome syntenic with the Sr47 region was used to identify wheat expressed sequence tags (ESTs) homologous to the B. distachyon genes. The wheat EST sequences were then used to develop sequence-tagged site (STS) markers. By analyzing the markers for polymorphism between Rusty and DAS15, we identified a co-dominant STS marker, designated as Xrwgs38, which amplified 175 and 187 bp fragments from wheat chromosome 2B and Ae. speltoides chromosome 2S segments, respectively. The marker co-segregated with the Ae. speltoides segments carrying Sr47 in the families from four BC2F1 plants, including the parent plants for durum lines RWG35 and RWG36 with the pedigree of Rusty/3/Rusty 5D(5B)/DAS15//47-1 5D(5B). Analysis of 62 durum and common wheat cultivars/lines lacking the Sr47 segment indicated that they all possessed the 175-bp allele of Xrwgs38, indicating that it was diagnostic for the small Ae. speltoides segment carrying Sr47. This study demonstrated that Xrwgs38 will facilitate the selection of Sr47 in durum and common wheat breeding."

Wide crossing continued with sporadic attempts in the first half of 19th century and became a sophisticated scientific discipline during the last few decades with considerable impact in farmers' fields. However, a large diversity of untapped genetic resources could contribute in meeting future wheat production challenges."
"29240874","abstracttext_perspectives and conclusion","Recently the complete reference genome of hexaploid (Chinese Spring) and tetraploid (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) wheat became publicly available coupled with on-going international efforts on wheat pan-genome sequencing. We anticipate that an objective appraisal is required in the post-genomics era to prioritize genetic resources for use in the improvement of wheat production if the goal of doubling yield by 2050 is to be met. Advances in genomics have resulted in the development of high-throughput genotyping arrays, improved and efficient methods of gene discovery, genomics-assisted selection and gene editing using endonucleases. Likewise, ongoing advances in rapid generation turnover, improved phenotyping, envirotyping and analytical methods will significantly accelerate exploitation of exotic genes and increase the rate of genetic gain in breeding. We argue that the integration of these advances will significantly improve the precision and targeted identification of potentially useful variation in the wild relatives of wheat, providing new opportunities to contribute to yield and quality improvement, tolerance to abiotic stresses, resistance to emerging biotic stresses and resilience to weather extremes."

"9276935","abstracttext","Genomic DNA fragments from Triticum tauschii (D-genome donor to wheat) carrying starch branching enzyme I (SBE I) type genes have been characterized. One fragment contains one complete gene and two partial genes in 16 kb of DNA. One of the partial genes is oriented in the opposite strand to the other two. The gene that is complete was sequenced. Its structure corresponds closely to that of rice in that exons 3-8 are retained at similar sizes and spacings. A cDNA closely corresponding to the complete gene was isolated and characterized; it codes for a putative protein that represents a novel type of SBE I, as it is shorter at the 3' end than the forms reported so far in other plants. A second genomic fragment contains a different SBE I gene. There appear to be approximately 10 copies of SBE I type genes in wheat (approximately 5 in T. tauschii) and most of them have been assigned to group 7 chromosomes. In situ hybridization indicates that a major locus for the genes is located at the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 7D."

We investigated the genetic basis and diversity of resistance in nine durum genotypes that are highly resistant to the new race. These resistant durums were crossed with the susceptible cv. Atil C2000 and intercrossed in a half diallel arrangement. Five diverse sources of resistance were identified by evaluating parents, F 1 , F 2 , and F 3 populations in greenhouse and/or field trials under artificial epidemics of race BBG/BN. The same pair of partially dominant complementary genes determined resistance in Jupare C2001, Hualita, and Pohowera. Somateria and Llareta INIA shared the same dominant resistance gene, whereas a partially dominant gene conferred resistance in two sister lines, Guayacan 2 and Guayacan INIA. A different partially dominant gene present in Storlom was linked in repulsion to another partially dominant gene in Camayo. These diverse resistance genes can be used effectively to control leaf rust, preferably by deploying them in combinations."

"12715154","abstracttext","Wheat chromosome 5A plays a key role in cold acclimation and frost tolerance. The major frost tolerance gene Fr-A1(formerly Fr1) and two loci that regulate the transcription of cold- regulated genes (Cor) have previously been mapped on the long arm of this chromosome. In this study we report the discovery of a new locus for frost tolerance designated Fr-A2. This new locus was mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5A of diploid wheat (T. monococcum), 40 cM from the centromere and 30 cM proximal to the major frost tolerance locus Fr-A1. We found also that frost-tolerant and frost-susceptible T. monococcum parental lines differed in the transcription level of the cold induced gene Cor14b when plants were grown at 15 degrees C. Transcription levels of this gene were measured in each of the recombinant inbred lines and mapped as a QTL that perfectly overlapped the QTL for frost survival at the Fr-A2 locus. This result suggested that frost tolerance in this cross was mediated by differential regulation of the expression of the Corgenes. In a previous study in hexaploid wheat (T. aestivum) we had shown that Cor14b was regulated by two loci located on chromosome 5A, one in the same chromosome region as the T. monococcum Fr-A2 locus and the other one closely linked to Fr-A1. Since CBF transcriptional activators in Arabidopsis regulate Corgenes and are involved in frost tolerance, we decided to localize the cold-regulated CBF-like barley gene Cbf3 on the T. monococcum map. This gene was mapped on the peak of the Fr-A2 QTL for frost tolerance. This result suggests that the observed differential regulation of Cor14b at the Fr-A2 locus is due to allelic variation at the XCbf3 locus, and that this transcriptional activator gene might be a candidate gene for the Fr-A2 frost tolerance locus on wheat chromosome 5A."

"17534593","abstracttext","Comparisons of complete chloroplast genome sequences of Hordeum vulgare, Sorghum bicolor and Agrostis stolonifera to six published grass chloroplast genomes reveal that gene content and order are similar but two microstructural changes have occurred. First, the expansion of the IR at the SSC/IRa boundary that duplicates a portion of the 5' end of ndhH is restricted to the three genera of the subfamily Pooideae (Agrostis, Hordeum and Triticum). Second, a 6 bp deletion in ndhK is shared by Agrostis, Hordeum, Oryza and Triticum, and this event supports the sister relationship between the subfamilies Erhartoideae and Pooideae. Repeat analysis identified 19-37 direct and inverted repeats 30 bp or longer with a sequence identity of at least 90%. Seventeen of the 26 shared repeats are found in all the grass chloroplast genomes examined and are located in the same genes or intergenic spacer (IGS) regions. Examination of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) identified 16-21 potential polymorphic SSRs. Five IGS regions have 100% sequence identity among Zea mays, Saccharum officinarum and Sorghum bicolor, whereas no spacer regions were identical among Oryza sativa, Triticum aestivum, H. vulgare and A. stolonifera despite their close phylogenetic relationship. Alignment of EST sequences and DNA coding sequences identified six C-U conversions in both Sorghum bicolor and H. vulgare but only one in A. stolonifera. Phylogenetic trees based on DNA sequences of 61 protein-coding genes of 38 taxa using both maximum parsimony and likelihood methods provide moderate support for a sister relationship between the subfamilies Erhartoideae and Pooideae."

"30555091","abstracttext","Eight candidate housekeeping genes were examined as internal controls for normalizing expression analysis of durum wheat ( Triticum durum L. ) under drought and salinity stress conditions. Quantitative real-time PCR was used to analyse gene expression of multiple stress levels, plant ages (24 and 50 days old), and plant tissues (leaf and root). The algorithms BestKeeper, NormFinder, GeNorm, the delta Ct method and the RefFinder were applied to determine the stability of candidate genes. Under drought stress, the most stable reference genes were glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate , ubiquitin and β- tubulin2 , whereas under salinity stress conditions, eukaryotic elongation factor 1-α , glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate and actin were identified as the most stable reference genes. Validation with stress-responsive genes NAC29 and NAC6 demonstrated that the expression level of target genes could be determined reliably with combinations of up to three of the reference genes. This is the first report on reference genes appropriate for quantification of target gene expression in T. durum under drought and salt stresses. Results of this investigation may be applicable to other Triticum species."

"10380798","abstracttext","A genomic DNA fragment containing the 5'-upstream sequence and part of the open reading frame corresponding to Triticum aestivum puroindoline-b cDNA, was isolated by inverse PCR. Promoter fragments extending to -1068, -388, -210 or -124 upstream of the translation initiation ATG codon and the sequence coding for the first 13 amino acids of the puroindoline-b, were translationally fused to the uidA reporter gene encoding beta-glucuronidase and transferred to rice calli via particle bombardment-mediated transformation. The 1068 bp and 124 bp promoters were also transcriptionally fused to the uidA reporter gene. Out of the 196 plants regenerated from transformed rice calli, 118 plants set seeds. No GUS activity was detectable in the stems, roots, leaves or pollen of the transgenic rice which had integrated the puroindoline-b promoter or its deletions; GUS activity was detected only in seeds, except in those having integrated the 124 bp promoter. Within seeds, histological localisation showed GUS activity as being restricted to the endosperm, aleurone cells and pericarp cell layers; no GUS activity was detected in the embryonic axis. Analysis of 5' promoter deletions identified the region between -388 and -210 as essential for endosperm expression, and the region between -210 and -124 as essential for expression in the epithelium of the scutellum. No difference of expression was observed between the translational and transcriptional fusion genes."

"12185502","abstracttext","Mitochondrial DNA from Triticum timopheevi has a chimeric gene, orf256, upstream of coxI. This gene is cotranscribed with coxI in cytoplasmic male sterile plants and produces a 7-kDa protein which is not produced in fertile or fertility-restored plants. T. aestivum, the nuclear donor in sterile plants, does not have orf256. Analysis by polymerase chain reaction of DNA from barley, rye, Aegilops bicornis, Ae. searsii, Ae. sharonensis, Ae. speltoides, Ae. tauschii, T. monococcum, and T. turgidum was done with oligonucleotide primers designed to detect orf256 or coxI sequences. Except for T. turgidum, these plants have various elements of the orf256 sequence over a 1-kb length of DNA immediately upstream of coxI in exactly the same arrangement as is found in the coxI region of T. timopheevi. Only T. timopheevi and Ae. speltoides have orf256 transcripts, and only cytoplasmic male-sterile plants involving these two species as maternal donors produce a protein from orf256. Part of an orf256-like sequence is present in T. turgidum but is at least slightly different in arrangement relative to coxI, as compared with the sequence in T. timopheevi. Neither maize nor sorghum have the orf256 sequence."

Based on morphology and sequence data of the large subunit nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (LSU, 28S) and the internal transcribed spacers and 5.8S rRNA gene of the nrDNA operon, the genus Dinemasporium is circumscribed, and an epitype designated for D. strigosum, the type of the genus. A further five species are introduced in Dinemasporium, namely D. pseudostrigosum (isolated from Triticum aestivum, Germany and Stigmaphyllon sagraeanum, Cuba), D. americana (soil, USA), D. polygonum (Polygonum sachalinense, Netherlands), D. pseudoindicum (soil, USA), and D. morbidum (human sputum, Netherlands and hare dung, New Zealand). Brunneodinemasporium, based on B. brasiliense, is introduced to accommodate Dinemasporium-like species with tightly aggregated brown conidiogenous cells, and pale brown conidia. Dendrophoma (= Amphitiarospora) is reinstated as distinct from Dinemasporium, and an epitype designated for D. cytisporoides, characterised by its superficial, stipitate to cupulate conidiomata, and small conidia with two polar, tubular, exogenous appendages. The genus Stauronema is reduced to synonymy under Dinemasporium. Pseudolachnea (1-septate conidia) is supported as distinct from Dinemasporium (aseptate conidia), and P. fraxini introduced as a novel species. Taxa in this generic complex differ by combination of morphological characters of conidiomata, setae, conidia and appendages.

"28790447","abstracttext","E3 ligases play significant roles in plant stress tolerance by targeting specific substrate proteins for post-translational modification. In a previous study, we cloned TaPUB1 from Triticum aestivum L., which encodes a U-box E3 ligase. Real-time polymerase chain reaction revealed that the gene was up-regulated under drought stress. To investigate the function of TaPUB1 in the response of plants to drought, we generated transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana (N. benthamiana) plants constitutively expressing TaPUB1 under the CaMV35S promoter. Compared to wild type (WT), the transgenic plants had higher germination and seedling survival rates as well as higher photosynthetic rate and water retention, suggesting that the overexpression of TaPUB1 enhanced the drought tolerance of the TaPUB1 overexpressing (OE) plants. Moreover, less accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and stronger antioxidant capacity were detected in the OE plants than in the WT plants. To characterize the mechanisms involved, methyl viologen (MV) was used to induce oxidative stress conditions and we identified the functions of this gene in the plant tolerance to oxidative stress. Our results suggest that TaPUB1 positively modulates plant drought stress resistance potential by improving their antioxidant capacity."

"18433440","abstracttext","A salt-responsive gene WRSI5 was characterized from salt-tolerant cultivar Shanrong No. 3 (SR3), an introgression line via asymmetric somatic hybrid between Triticum aestivum L. cv. Jinan177 (JN177) and Thinopyrum ponticum Podp. The peptide encoded by WRSI5 contains a Bowman-Birk domain sharing a high level of sequence identity to monocotyledonous protease inhibitors. When expressed in vitro, the WRSI5 gene product exhibited trypsin, but not chymotrypsin inhibition. The expression level of WRSI5 was increased in SR3 roots exposed to salt, drought or oxidative stress. In situ hybridization showed that it is induced in the endodermal cells of the mature region of the SR3 root tip, with no signal detectable in the corresponding region of the salt-susceptible cultivar JN177. SR3 has a higher selectivity for K(+) over Na(+), and therefore limits the transport of Na(+) from the root to the shoot. When overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana, WRSI5 improves the ability of seedlings to grow on a medium containing 150 mM NaCl. We suggest that WRSI5 plays an important role in regulating the plant growth rate or long-distance Na(+) transport in SR3 plants exposed to salt stress."

"11504852","abstracttext","The cytosolic isoform of plant acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a multidomain enzyme involved in the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids and in secondary metabolism. Chromosome mapping of wheat identified one locus containing cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes (Acc-2) and a related partially processed pseudogene (Psi-Acc-2) in the distal region of the long arm of wheat homoeologous group 3 chromosomes. Multiple copies of the Acc-2 genes, whose presence was suggested by sequence analysis, are likely to be arranged in tandem repeats. At least three out of five genes cloned from hexaploid wheat map to this locus. Another locus containing Acc-2--related sequences is present in the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 5D. The identity of the hybridizing DNA present at this locus remains unknown. A system based on PCR-cloning and DNA sequence analysis of acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes was developed to address various phylogenetic and systematics questions in grasses. It was applied to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Acc-2 genes from D- and S-genome Aegilops and A-genome Triticum diploid species, AABB- and AAGG-genome tetraploid wheat, and AABBDD-genome hexaploid wheat, as well as from rye and barley. The combined cytogenetic and molecular evolution approach allowed assignment of gene sequences included in phylogenetic analysis to specific loci on homoeologous chromosomes. Recurring gene duplication followed by chromosome translocation and/or possible loss of some gene copies, as well as loss of introns, occurred in the gene family in different plant lineages. Two major Acc-2 clades appeared before the divergence of barley and rye. Nucleotide substitution rates in different parts of the Acc-2 gene were assessed. This analysis of the Acc-2 loci provides detailed information regarding evolutionary events at a low--copy-number locus containing important functional genes. These events are likely to be common and to play a significant role in shaping grass genomes."

The chromosomal location of the resistance gene identified was determined by crossing the complete set of 'Langdon' - 'Chinese Spring' D-genome disomic substitution lines with S12-1. Tests of the F1 and F2 generations of each cross indicated that only chromosome 3A was associated with resistance. Therefore, the resistance gene is considered to be located on chromosome 3A and has been designated temporarily as SnbTM."

"22350087","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is an important foliar disease of wheat worldwide. The dominant powdery mildew resistance gene PmAS846 was transferred to the hexaploid wheat lines N9134 and N9738 from wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) in 1995, and it is still one of the most effective resistance genes in China. A high resolution genetic map for PmAS846 locus was constructed using two F(2) populations and corresponding F(2:3) families developed from the crosses of N9134/Shaanyou 225 and N9738/Huixianhong. Synteny between wheat and Brachypodium distachyon and rice was used to develop closely linked molecular markers to reduce the genetic interval around PmAS846. Twenty-six expressed sequence tag-derived markers were mapped to the PmAS846 locus. Five markers co-segregated with PmAS846 in the F(2) population of N9134/Shaanyou 225. PmAS846 was physically located to wheat chromosome 5BL bin 0.75-0.76 within a gene-rich region. The markers order is conserved between wheat and Brachypodium distachyon, but rearrangements are present in rice. Two markers, BJ261635 and CJ840011 flanked PmAS846 and narrowed PmAS846 to a region that is collinear with 197 and 112 kb genomic regions on Brachypodium chromosome 4 and rice chromosome 9, respectively. The genes located on the corresponding homologous regions in Brachypodium, rice and barley could be considered for further marker saturation and identification of potential candidate genes for PmAS846. The markers co-segregating with PmAS846 provide a potential target site for positional cloning of PmAS846, and can be used for marker-assisted selection of this gene."

"30530679","abstracttext","Fifteen full-length wheat grain avenin-like protein coding genes ( TaALP ) were identified on chromosome arms 7AS, 4AL, and 7DS of bread wheat with each containing five genes. Besides the a- and b-type ALPs, a c type was identified in the current paper. Both a and b types have two subunits, named x and y types. The five genes on each of the three chromosome arms consisted of two x-type genes, two y-type genes, and one c-type gene. The a-type genes were typically of 520 bp in length, whereas the b types were of 850 bp in length, and the c type was of 470 bp in length. The ALP gene transcript levels were significantly up-regulated in Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) -infected wheat grain caryopsis at early grain filling. Wild emmer wheat [(WEW), Triticum dicoccoides ] populations were focused on in our paper to identify allelic variations of ALP genes and to study the influence of natural selection on certain alleles. Consequently, 25 alleles were identified for TdALP-bx-7AS , 13 alleles were identified for TdALP-ax-7AS , 7 alleles were identified for TdALP-ay-7AS , and 4 alleles were identified for TdALP-ax-4AL Correlation studies on TdALP gene diversity and ecological stresses suggested that environmental factors contribute to the ALP polymorphism formation in WEW. Many allelic variants of ALPs in the endosperm of WEW are not present in bread wheat and therefore could be utilized in breeding bread wheat varieties for better quality and elite plant defense characteristics."

"27481288","abstracttext","Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) are truncated derivatives of autonomous DNA transposons, and are dispersed abundantly in eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomes. In this article, a MITE, TaMITE81, was isolated from the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of TaCHS7BL, chalcone synthase (CHS) catalyzing the first committed step of anthocyanin biosynthesis, in the wheat cultivar 'Opata' with white grain. TaMITE81 was only 81 nucleotides, including a terminal inverted repeat with 39 nucleotides and was flanked by two nucleotides, ""TA"", target site duplications that were typical features of stowaway-like MITEs. Compared with the wheat cultivar 'Gy115' with purple grain, which is without the insertion, the expression of TaCHS7BL was lower in several organs of 'Opata'. The insertion of TaMITE81 into the 5' UTR of the GUS gene also reduced the transient expression of GUS on the coleoptiles of 'Opata', which means the insertion of TaMITE81 was the reason for the low expression of TaCHS7BL in 'Opata'. But the genotype of TaCHS7BL was not linked to phenotype of grain color in the RILs derived from a cross 'Gy115' and 'Opata'. The TaMITE81 density of the hexaploid variety of T. aestivum was more than 10 times that of diploid relatives, which implies that polyploidization caused the amplification of TaMITE81 homologous sequences. Further research should be conducted on decoding the relationship between TaCHS7BL and other traits relative to anthocyanin biosynthesis in wheat, and discovering the mechanism of TaMITE81 transposon action."

In this work, 19 new full-length γ-gliadin genes were isolated from various Aegilops and Triticum species. Sequence characterization showed that a specific octapeptide and celiac disease (CD)-toxic epitope Gliγ-3 (VQGQGIIQPQQPAQL) were present in the rich glutamine domain and C-terminal non-repetitive domain, respectively. Based on the sequence features of both peptides, a new classification system for γ-gliadin gene family was established, in which γ-gliadins were classified into two types (types I and II) with each consisting of two groups. An uneven distribution of different types and groups of γ-gliadin genes was exhibited among 11 Aegilops and Triticum genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that types I and II genes diverged at about 14 MYA while the divergence of 4 γ-gliadin group genes occurred at around 10 MYA almost simultaneously. The γ-gliadin genes from S(l) and B genomes displayed a different transcriptional expression pattern during grain development, and rapid increasing of gliadin mRNA and proteins occurred at 15-20 DPA. In addition, genome-specific variations of CD-toxic epitopes among Aegilops and Triticum genomes were found. The A genome and its related progenitor genomes A(u) and A(m) had fewer CD epitopes than other genomes, suggesting that these genomes might be valuable gene resources to remove CD toxic peptides for wheat quality improvement."

"29636761","abstracttext","Stem rust (caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici Erikss. & E. Henn.), is a major disease in wheat ( Triticum aestivium L.). However, in recent years it occurs rarely in Nebraska due to weather and the effective selection and gene pyramiding of resistance genes. To understand the genetic basis of stem rust resistance in Nebraska winter wheat, we applied genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a set of 270 winter wheat genotypes (A-set). Genotyping was carried out using genotyping-by-sequencing and ∼35,000 high-quality SNPs were identified. The tested genotypes were evaluated for their resistance to the common stem rust race in Nebraska (QFCSC) in two replications. Marker-trait association identified 32 SNP markers, which were significantly (Bonferroni corrected P < 0.05) associated with the resistance on chromosome 2D. The chromosomal location of the significant SNPs (chromosome 2D) matched the location of Sr6 gene which was expected in these genotypes based on pedigree information. A highly significant linkage disequilibrium (LD, r 2 ) was found between the significant SNPs and the specific SSR marker for the Sr6 gene ( Xcfd43 ). This suggests the significant SNP markers are tagging Sr6 gene. Out of the 32 significant SNPs, eight SNPs were in six genes that are annotated as being linked to disease resistance in the IWGSC RefSeq v1.0. The 32 significant SNP markers were located in nine haplotype blocks. All the 32 significant SNPs were validated in a set of 60 different genotypes (V-set) using single marker analysis.

"8595658","abstracttext","The gene region coding for subunits alpha and 9 of the mitochondrial ATP synthase exhibit an identical DNA sequence in wheat, rye, and the intergeneric hybrid triticale (xTriticosecale Wittmack). However, co-transcripts containing both genes show different sizes depending on the nuclear genotype. To investigate nuclear-mitochondrial interactions leading to this variation, we performed a comparative transcript analysis with various lines carrying defined nuclear and cytoplasmic genotypes. Northern analyses showed that all wheat lines investigated possess a single atpA/atp9 mRNA of 2.6kb, whereas in rye and five independent triticale lines an additional transcript of 2.35kb appeared. Primer-extension and RNase-protection analyses indicate that the co-transcripts of this gene have staggered 5' termini in some lines, whereas the 3' termini seem to be similar in wheat, rye, and triticale. Transcription is initiated at position -338/-339 upstream of the atpA gene in all lines investigated, giving rise to a 2.6-kb mRNA. In rye and triticale, staggered 5' termini were observed closer to the translational start. The DNA sequences upstream of these termini exhibit homology to plant mitochondrial-processing sites, therefore the proximal 5' ends are most probably generated by RNA processing. As the processing event occurs more frequently in triticale carrying the Triticum timopheevi cytoplasm, trans-acting factors from rye are likely to interact with other cytoplasmic factors resulting in the observed RNA modification. Most interestingly, the T. timopheevi cytoplasm inducing male sterility in alloplasmic wheat, fails to generate the CMS phenotype in triticale. The data support our hypothesis that nuclear factors affect mitochondrial gene expression and thus control sexual fertility in wheat and triticale."

The wheat tiller inhibition gene (tin3) is located on Triticum monococcum chromosome 3 A(m)L near vp1. Triticeae group 3 is reportedly collinear with rice chromosome 1, which also contains the maize barren stalk1 and rice lax branching orthogene near vp1.

In the current study, we made use of tetraploid wheat mapping populations derived from a cross between durum wheat (cv. Langdon) and wild emmer (accession G18-16) to identify and map a new powdery mildew resistance gene derived from wild emmer wheat. Initially, the two parental lines were screened with a collection of 42 isolates of Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici (Bgt) from Israel and 5 isolates from Switzerland. While G18-16 was resistant to 34 isolates, Langdon was resistant only to 5 isolates and susceptible to 42 isolates. Isolate Bgt#15 was selected to differentiate between the disease reactions of the two genotypes. Segregation ratio of F(2-3) and recombinant inbreed line (F(7)) populations to inoculation with isolate Bgt#15 indicated the role of a single dominant gene in conferring resistance to Bgt#15. This gene, temporarily designated PmG16, was located on the distal region of chromosome arm 7AL. Genetic map of PmG16 region was assembled with 32 simple sequence repeat (SSR), sequence tag site (STS), Diversity array technology (DArT) and cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS) markers and assigned to the 7AL physical bin map (7AL-16). Using four DNA markers we established colinearity between the genomic region spanning the PmG16 locus within the distal region of chromosome arm 7AL and the genomic regions on rice chromosome 6 and Brachypodium Bd1. A comparative analysis was carried out between PmG16 and other known Pm genes located on chromosome arm 7AL.

Genetic analysis of an F(2) population and the F(2:3) families developed from a cross of P63 and a susceptible common wheat line Xuezao showed that the powdery mildew resistance in P63 was controlled by a single recessive gene. Molecular markers and bulked segregant analysis were used to characterize and map the powdery mildew resistance gene. Nine genomic SSR markers (Xbarc7, Xbarc55, Xgwm148, Xgwm257, Xwmc35, Xwmc154, Xwmc257, Xwmc382, Xwmc477), five AFLP-derived SCAR markers (XcauG3, XcauG6, XcauG10, XcauG20, XcauG22), three EST-STS markers (BQ160080, BQ160588, BF146221) and one RFLP-derived STS marker (Xcau516) were linked to the resistance gene, designated pm42, in P63. pm42 was physically mapped on chromosome 2BS bin 0.75-0.84 using Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic and deletion lines, and was estimated to be more than 30 cM proximal to Xcau516, a RFLP-derived STS marker that co-segregated with the wild emmer-derived Pm26 which should be physically located in 2BS distal bin 0.84-1.00. pm42 was highly effective against 18 of 21 differential Chinese isolates of B. graminis f. sp. tritici. The closely linked molecular markers will enable the rapid transfer of pm42 to wheat breeding populations thus adding to their genetic diversity."

"30762083","abstracttext_key message","Modifying morphometric inflorescence traits is important for increasing grain yield in wheat. Mapping revealed nine QTL, including new QTL and a new allele for the q locus, controlling wheat spike morphometric traits. To identify loci controlling spike morphometric traits, namely spike length (SL), internode length (IL), node number per spike (NPS), and node density (ND), we studied 146 Recombinant Inbred Lines of tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) derived from standard spike and spike-branching mutant parents. Phenotypic analyses of spike morphometric traits showed low genetic coefficients of variation, resulting in high heritabilities. The phenotypic correlation between NPS with growing degree days (GDD) suggested the importance of GDD in the determination of node number in wheat. The major effect QTL for GDD or heading date was mapped to chromosome 7BS carrying the flowering time gene, Vrn3-B1. Mapping also identified nine QTL controlling spike morphometric traits. Most of these loci controlled more than a single trait, suggesting a close genetic interrelationship among spike morphometric traits. For example, this study identified a new QTL, QND.ipk-4AL, controlling ND (up to 17.6% of the phenotypic variance), IL (up to 11% of the phenotypic variance), and SL (up to 20.8% of the phenotypic variance). Similarly, the major effect QTL for IL was mapped to the q locus. Sequencing of the Q/q gene further revealed a new q allele, q del -5A, in spike-branching accessions possessing a six base pair deletion close to the miR172 target site. The identification of q del -5A suggested that the spike-branching tetraploid wheats are double mutants for the spikelet meristem (SM) identity gene, i.e., branched head t (TtBH t ), and the q gene, which is believed to be involved in the SM indeterminacy complex in wheat."

"12021852","abstracttext","Sequencing of a contiguous 215-kb interval of Triticum monococcum showed the presence of five genes in the same order as in previously sequenced colinear barley and rice BACs. Gene 2 was in the same orientation in wheat and rice but inverted in barley. Gene density in this region was 1 gene per 43 kb and the ratio of physical to genetic distance was estimated to be 2,700 kb cM(-1). Twenty more-or-less intact retrotransposons were found in the intergenic regions, covering at least 70% of the sequenced region. The insertion times of 11 retrotransposons were less than 5 million years ago and were consistent with their nested structure. Five new families of retro-elements and the first full-length elements for two additional retrotransposon families were discovered in this region. Significantly higher values of GC content were observed for Triticeae BACs compared with rice BACs. Relative enrichment or depletion of certain dinucleotides was observed in the comparison of introns, exons and retrotransposons. A higher proportion of transitions in CG and CNG sites that are targets for cytosine methylation was observed in retrotransposons (76%) than in introns (37%). These results showed that the wheat genome is a complex mixture of different sequence elements, but with general patterns of content and interspersion that are similar to those seen in maize and barley."

"12750342","abstracttext","The Q locus played a major role in the domestication of wheat because it confers the free-threshing character and influences many other agronomically important traits. We constructed a physical contig spanning the Q locus using a Triticum monococcum BAC library. Three chromosome walking steps were performed by complete sequencing of BACs and identification of low-copy markers through similarity searches of database sequences. The BAC contig spans a physical distance of approximately 300 kb corresponding to a genetic distance of 0.9 cM. The physical map of T. monococcum had perfect colinearity with the genetic map of wheat chromosome arm 5AL. Recombination data in conjunction with analysis of fast neutron deletions confirmed that the contig spanned the Q locus. The Q gene was narrowed to a 100-kb segment, which contains an APETALA2 (AP2)-like gene that cosegregates with Q. AP2 is known to play a major role in controlling floral homeotic gene expression and thus is an excellent candidate for Q."

"22002128","abstracttext","Aiganfanmai is a dwarf tetraploid wheat landrace (Triticum turgidum var. turgidum) that stably produces the semi-dwarf trait. Plant height varies from 80-105 cm under cultivation. Compared with tall durum wheat (T. turgidum var. durum) variety Langdon, we found it to have short spikes and seeds, besides a semi-dwarf character. We crossed Aiganfanmai with Langdon to analyze the genetic basis of the semi-dwarf trait. The F(2) population segregated at a 1:3 ratio for the short trait to the normal, which demonstrates that Aiganfanmai carries a recessive reduced height (Rht) gene. This gene was found to be located between the molecular markers Xgwm471 and Xgwm350 on chromosome arm 7AS by microsatellite analysis. No Rht gene had been reported from this chromosome; we designated it as Rht22. Rht 22, unlike other previously reported Rht genes, does not reduce internodal cell length. Reduced cell numbers might explain the short stem trait."

"29065389","abstracttext","Wheat, the main food source for a third of world population, appears strongly under threat because of predicted increasing temperatures coupled to drought. Plant complex molecular response to drought stress relies on the gene network controlling cell reactions to abiotic stress. In the natural environment, plants are subjected to the combination of abiotic and biotic stresses. Also the response of plants to biotic stress, to cope with pathogens, involves the activation of a molecular network. Investigations on combination of abiotic and biotic stresses indicate the existence of cross-talk between the two networks and a kind of overlapping can be hypothesized. In this work we describe the isolation and characterization of a drought-related durum wheat (Triticum durum Desf.) gene, identified in a previous study, coding for a protein combining features of NBS-LRR type resistance protein with a S/TPK domain, involved in drought stress response. This is one of the few examples reported where all three domains are present in a single protein and, to our knowledge, it is the first report on a gene specifically induced by drought stress and drought-related conditions, with this particular structure."

"31142188","abstracttext","The main seed storage protein in wheat is gluten. It consists of gliadin and glutenins. Gluten gives high elasticity and extensibility during bread making, facilitating the formation of the dough. Rice is the staple food of Sri Lankans but, it has poor dough making ability compared to wheat. The aim of the present work was to characterize, clone and express α-gliadin in the T 0 generation of Bg 250 rice variety as a preliminary step in improving the dough making ability of rice flour. Five α-gliadin recombinant pCR™ 2.1-TOPO ® clones were selected for sequence analysis. Of the five clones, two functional genes and three pseudogenes were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the two functional genes, (accession numbers KC660359 and KC660358) to be closely related to the α-gliadin genes of Triticum monococcum . The α-gliadin gene (KC660359) contained five cysteine residues, one less than the normal occurrence of cysteine residues in α-gliadin genes. To date there are no reports on expression of gliadin gene in transgenic rice. This novel gene was successfully expressed in the Sri Lankan rice variety Bg 250 under the control of the rice GluB-1 endosperm specific promoter."

A novel manganese superoxide dismutase gene, denoted as TmMnSOD, was identified from Triticum monococcum. The encoded protein displayed high sequence identity with MnSOD family members and was highly homologous to TdMnSOD from durum wheat. Furthermore, the 3D structure analysis revealed that TmMnSOD displayed homotetramer subunit organization, incorporating four Mn 2+ ions. Notably, TmMnSOD structure contains predominantly alpha helices with three beta sheets. On the other hand, under stress conditions, TmMnSOD transcript level was significantly up-regulated by salt, oxidative and heavy metal stresses. At the functional level, TmMnSOD imparts tolerance of yeast and E. coli cells under diverse stresses. Promoter analysis of TmMnSOD gene showed the presence of a great number of salt and pathogen-responsive cis-regulatory elements, highlighting the interest of this gene in breeding programs towards improved tolerance to salt stress in wheat."

"17318496","abstracttext","The domestication of emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum spp. dicoccoides, genomes BBAA) was one of the key events during the emergence of agriculture in southwestern Asia, and was a prerequisite for the evolution of durum and common wheat. Single- and multilocus genotypes based on restriction fragment length polymorphism at 131 loci were analyzed to describe the structure of populations of wild and domesticated emmer and to generate a picture of emmer domestication and its subsequent diffusion across Asia, Europe and Africa. Wild emmer consists of two populations, southern and northern, each further subdivided. Domesticated emmer mirrors the geographic subdivision of wild emmer into the northern and southern populations and also shows an additional structure in both regions. Gene flow between wild and domesticated emmer occurred across the entire area of wild emmer distribution. Emmer was likely domesticated in the Diyarbakir region in southeastern Turkey, which was followed by subsequent hybridization and introgression from wild to domesticated emmer in southern Levant. A less likely scenario is that emmer was domesticated independently in the Diyarbakir region and southern Levant, and the Levantine genepool was absorbed into the genepool of domesticated emmer diffusing from southeastern Turkey. Durum wheat is closely related to domesticated emmer in the eastern Mediterranean and likely originated there."

"20149116","abstracttext","To understand key mechanisms leading to stabilized allopolyploid species, we characterized the meiotic behaviour of wheat allohexaploids in relation to structural and genetic changes. For that purpose, we analysed first generations of synthetic allohexaploids obtained through interspecific hybridization, followed by spontaneous chromosome doubling, between several genotypes of Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii wheat species, donors of AB and D genomes, respectively. As expected for these Ph1 (Pairing homoeologous 1) gene-carrying allopolyploids, chromosome pairing at metaphase I of meiosis essentially occurs between homologous chromosomes. However, the different synthetic allohexaploids exhibited progenitor-dependent meiotic irregularities, such as incomplete homologous pairing, resulting in univalent formation and leading to aneuploidy in the subsequent generation. Stability of the synthetic allohexaploids was shown to depend on the considered genotypes of both AB and D genome progenitors, where few combinations compare to the natural wheat allohexaploid in terms of regularity of meiosis and euploidy. Aneuploidy represents the only structural change observed in these synthetic allohexaploids, as no apparent DNA sequence elimination or rearrangement was observed when analysing euploid plants with molecular markers, developed from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as well as simple sequence repeat (SSR) and transposable element sequences."

"21897130","abstracttext","Hybrid necrosis sometimes appears in triploid hybrids between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii Coss. Two types of hybrid necrosis (type II and type III) were observed when cultivar Langdon was used as female parent for hybrid production. Type II necrosis symptoms occurred only under low temperature conditions, whereas bushy and dwarf phenotypes were observed under normal temperature conditions. The developmental plasticity might be related to a temperature-responsive alteration of meristematic activity at the crown tissue of triploid hybrids. Epistatic interaction between the AB and D genomes induced not only upregulation of a number of defense-related genes, but also extensive changes in plant architecture in the type II necrosis hybrids. Such phenotypic plasticity was also observed in other cross combinations between cultivated tetraploid wheat and type II necrosis-induced Ae. tauschii accessions. Wild tetraploid wheat, Triticum turgidum subspecies dicoccoides, did not induce type II necrosis in the triploid hybrids, indicating the possibility of identifying the chromosomal location of a causal gene for type II necrosis in the AB genome."

"23577301","abstracttext","To study the D-genome of the wild wheat relative Aegilops tauschii Cosson at the hexaploid level, we developed a synthetic doubled-haploid (DH) hexaploid wheat population, SynDH3. This population was derived from the spontaneous chromosome doubling of triploid F1 hybrid plants obtained from a cross between Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccon PI377655 and A. tauschii ssp. strangulata AS66 × ssp. tauschii AS87. SynDH3 is a diploidization-hexaploid DH population containing recombinant D chromosomes from two different A. tauschii genotypes, with A and B chromosomes from T. turgidum being homogenous across the entire population. Using this population, we constructed a genetic map. Of the 440 markers used to construct the map, 421 (96%) were assigned to 12 linkage groups; these included 346 Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) and 75 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. The total map length of the seven D chromosomes spanned 916.27 cM, with an average length of 130.90 cM per chromosome and an average distance between markers of 3.47 cM. Seven segregation distortion regions were detected on seven linkage groups. Out of 50 markers shared with those on a common wheat map, 37 showed a consistent order. The utility of the diploidization-hexaploid DH population for mapping qualitative trait genes was confirmed using the dominant glaucousness-inhibiting gene W2 (I) as an example."

"24013035","abstracttext","Positive controls are essential for PCR reliability and are challenging to obtain for rare, exotic and/or emerging pathogens and pose biosafety risks if manufactured using infectious pathogens. Custom synthetic DNA inserts can be designed de novo in tandems of forward and reverse complement priming sequences to be inserted in circular plasmid vectors. To test this concept, artificial positive controls (APCs) for use in PCR were synthesized to contain primer sequences targeting four viruses (Barley yellow dwarf virus, Soilborne wheat mosaic virus, Triticum mosaic virus and Wheat streak mosaic virus) pathogenic to wheat and, as internal control, the plant mitochondrial nad5 gene. Thermodynamics and folding parameters of twenty-four APC inserts were assessed in silico. Two thermodynamically different APCs, designated optimal and sub-optimal, were cloned and tested using end point PCR. The optimal APC had a 100% amplification rate, while only 92% of virus-infected plant tissues, commonly used as reference positive controls, amplified. An array of APC priming sequences from different organisms and/or previously tested primers can be accommodated in a large and flexible number of positive control targets. APCs will streamline and standardize routine PCR, improve reliability and biosafety, and create opportunities for development and commercialization of new synthetic positive control sequences."

'Enano de Andujar' and the diploid rye cv. 'Petkus' has been made. Two silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions (Ag-NORs) (the chromosome pair 1 R) are observed in all rye plants analyzed, whereas four Ag-NORs (chromosome pairs 1 B and 6 B) are found both in the tetraploid wheat parent and in the triticale. The rye Ag-NORs are absent in the triticale. Since the Agstaining reaction of NORs can be considered as an indication for genetic activity, the silver procedure can be used to visualize gene functionality at the rDNA sites with conventional light microscopy and, consequently, the modified Ag-staining method described can be very useful in analyzing the amphiplasty phenomenon in natural or artificial hybrid combinations and derivatives in the Triticum group and its relatives."

A systematic understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in wheat resistance to Bgt is essential for effectively controlling the disease. Here, using the diploid wheat Triticum urartu as a host, the genes regulated by immune (IM) and hypersensitive reaction (HR) resistance responses to Bgt were investigated through transcriptome sequencing. Four gene coexpression networks (GCNs) were developed using transcriptomic data generated for 20 T. urartu accessions showing IM, HR or susceptible responses. The powdery mildew resistance regulated (PMRR) genes whose expression was significantly correlated with Bgt resistance were identified, and they tended to be hubs and enriched in six major modules. A wide occurrence of negative regulation of PMRR genes was observed. Three new candidate immune receptor genes (TRIUR3_13045, TRIUR3_01037 and TRIUR3_06195) positively associated with Bgt resistance were discovered. Finally, the involvement of TRIUR3_01037 in Bgt resistance was tentatively verified through cosegregation analysis in a F2 population and functional expression assay in Bgt susceptible leaf cells. This research provides insights into the global network properties of PMRR genes. Potential molecular differences between IM and HR resistance responses to Bgt are discussed."

"31136598","abstracttext","Bread wheat (AABBDD) originated from the diploid progenitor Triticum urartu (AA), a relative of Aegilops speltoides (BB), and Ae. tauschii (DD). The DREB1 transcriptional factor plays key regulatory role in low-temperature tolerance. The modern breeding strategies resulted in serious decrease of the agricultural biodiversity, which led to a loss of elite genes underlying abiotic stress tolerance in crops. However, knowledge of this gene's natural diversity is largely unknown in the genome donor species of wheat. We characterized the dehydration response element binding protein 1 (DREB1) gene-diversity pattern in Ae. speltoides, Ae. tauschii, T. monococcum and T. urartu. The highest nucleotide diversity value was detected in Ae. speltoides, followed by Ae. tauschii and T. monococcum. The lowest nucleotide diversity value was observed in T. urartu. Nucleotide diversity and haplotype data might suggest no reduction of nucleotide diversity during T. monococcum domestication. Alignment of the 68 DREB1 sequences found a large-size (70 bp) insertion/deletion in the accession PI486264 of Ae. speltoides, which was different from the copy of sequences from other accessions of Ae. speltoides, suggesting a likely existence of two different ancestral Ae. speltoides forms. Implication of sequences variation of Ae. speltoides on origination of B genome in wheat was discussed."

"32960712","abstracttext","Wheat blast caused by the Triticum pathotype of Pyricularia oryzae was first reported in 1985 in Brazil and recently spread to Bangladesh. We tested whether Rmg8 and RmgGR119 , recently identified resistance genes, were effective against Bangladeshi isolates of the pathogen. Common wheat accessions carrying Rmg8 alone (IL191) or both Rmg8 and RmgGR119 (GR119) were inoculated with Brazilian isolates (Br48, Br5, and Br116.5) and Bangladeshi isolates (T-108 and T-109). Br48, T-108, and T-109 carried the eI type of AVR-Rmg8 (the avirulence gene corresponding to Rmg8 ) while Br5 and Br116.5 carried its variants, eII and eII' types, respectively. Detached primary leaves of IL191 and GR119 were resistant to all isolates at 25°C. At a higher temperature (28°C), their resistance was still effective against the eI carriers but was reduced to a low level against the eII/eII' carriers. A survey of databases and sequence analyses revealed that all Bangladeshi isolates carried the eI type which induced a higher level of resistance than the eII/eII' types. The resistance of IL191 ( Rmg8 / - ) to the eI carriers was maintained even at the heading stage and at the higher temperature. In addition, GR119 ( Rmg8 / RmgGR119 ) displayed higher levels of resistance than IL191 at this stage. These results suggest that Rmg8 combined with RmgGR119 will be useful in breeding for resistance against wheat blast in Bangladesh."

Accession MG5323, resistant to powdery mildew, was crossed to the susceptible durum cultivar Latino and a set of 122 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was produced. F₁ and F₂ progenies and the RIL population were tested with one isolate of Blumeria graminis and data obtained indicated that a single dominant gene, temporarily designated Ml5323, controlled resistance at the seedling stage. Molecular markers were used to characterize and map the powdery mildew resistance gene. Twelve microsatellite markers were linked to the resistance gene, and among them, EST-SSR CA695634 was tightly linked to the resistance gene, which was assigned to chromosome arm 2BS and physically mapped to the gene rich region of fragment length (FL) 0.84-1.00.

Wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides), the ancestor of domesticated durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum), has great potential for improving the understanding of the wheat drought response. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a recently discovered class of gene expression regulators that have also been linked to several plant stress responses; however, this relationship is just beginning to be understood. miRNA expression patterns of drought-resistant wild emmer wheat in response to drought stress were investigated using a plant miRNA microarray platform. Expression was detected to be 205 miRNAs in control and 438 miRNAs in drought-stressed leaf and root tissues. Of these miRNAs, the following 13 were differentially regulated in response to drought: miR1867, miR896, miR398, miR528, miR474, miR1450, miR396, miR1881, miR894, miR156, miR1432, miR166 and miR171. Regulation of miRNAs upon 4 and 8 h drought stress applications observed by qRT-PCR. Target transcripts of differentially regulated miRNAs were computationally predicted. In addition to miRNA microarray study, five new conserved T. turgidum miRNAs were identified through a homology-based approach, and their secondary structures and putative targets were predicted. These findings both computationally and experimentally highlight the presence of miRNAs in T. dicoccoides and further extend the role of miRNAs under shock drought stress conditions."

"23702306","abstracttext","A novel family of antifungal peptides was discovered in the wheat Triticum kiharae Dorof. et Migusch. Two members of the family, designated Tk-AMP-X1 and Tk-AMP-X2, were completely sequenced and shown to belong to the α-hairpinin structural family of plant peptides with a characteristic C1XXXC2-X(n)-C3XXXC4 motif. The peptides inhibit the spore germination of several fungal pathogens in vitro. cDNA and gene cloning disclosed unique structure of genes encoding Tk-AMP-X peptides. They code for precursor proteins of unusual multimodular structure, consisting of a signal peptide, several α-hairpinin (4-Cys) peptide domains with a characteristic cysteine pattern separated by linkers and a C-terminal prodomain. Three types of precursor proteins, with five, six or seven 4-Cys peptide modules, were found in wheat. Among the predicted family members, several peptides previously isolated from T. kiharae seeds were identified. Genes encoding Tk-AMP-X precursors have no introns in the protein-coding regions and are upregulated by fungal pathogens and abiotic stress, providing conclusive evidence for their role in stress response. A combined PCR-based and bioinformatics approach was used to search for related genes in the plant kingdom. Homologous genes differing in the number of peptide modules were discovered in phylogenetically-related Triticum and Aegilops species, including polyploid wheat genome donors. Association of the Tk-AMP-X genes with A, B/G or D genomes of hexaploid wheat was demonstrated. Furthermore, Tk-AMP-X-related sequences were shown to be widespread in the Poaceae family among economically important crops, such as barley, rice and maize."

"26081164","abstracttext","Hybrid necrosis is a well-known reproductive isolation mechanism in plant species, and an autoimmune response is generally considered to trigger hybrid necrosis through epistatic interaction between disease resistance-related genes in hybrids. In common wheat, the complementary Ne1 and Ne2 genes control hybrid necrosis, defined as type I necrosis. Two other types of hybrid necrosis (type II and type III) have been observed in interspecific hybrids between tetraploid wheat and Aegilops tauschii. Another type of hybrid necrosis, defined here as type IV necrosis, has been reported in F1 hybrids between Triticum urartu and some accessions of Triticum monococcum ssp. aegilopoides. In types I, III and IV, cell death occurs gradually starting in older tissues, whereas type II necrosis symptoms occur only under low temperature. To compare comprehensive gene expression patterns of hybrids showing growth abnormalities, transcriptome analysis of type I and type IV necrosis was performed using a wheat 38k oligo-DNA microarray. Defense-related genes including many WRKY transcription factor genes were dramatically up-regulated in plants showing type I and type IV necrosis, similarly to other known hybrid abnormalities, suggesting an association with an autoimmune response. Reactive oxygen species generation and necrotic cell death were effectively inhibited by ZnCl2 treatment in types I, III and IV necrosis, suggesting a significant association of Ca(2+) influx in upstream signaling of necrotic cell death in wheat hybrid necrosis."

The WTG1 orthologs in barley (HvWTG1), rice (OsWTG1), Aegilops tauschii (AtWTG1), Triticum urartu (TuWTG1), Triticum turgidum (TtWTG1) and Brachypodium distachyon (BdWTG1) were also identified for comparative analyses. TaWTG1 was mapped onto the short arms of group 7 chromosomes (7AS, 7BS, and 7DS). Multiple alignments indicated that WTG1 possesses eight exons and seven introns in all of the orthologs, except for the orthologs on 7A of wild emmer and on 7D of A. tauschii (seven exons and six introns). An exon-intron junction composed of intron 2 to intron 3 and exon 2 to exon 4 was highly conserved. The protein of WTG1 exists a conserved domain (Peptidase_C65). WTG1 was mainly expressed in wheat roots, spikes and grains, in barley caryopsis and roots, and in rice anthers. Drought and heat stresses significantly regulated the expression of TaWTG1 in wheat. In barley, WTG1 was significantly down-regulated under Fusarium at late stage. In addition, significant correlations between the expression patterns of predicted transcription factors and WTG1 were also detected. Overall, the results presented here broaden our knowledge on WTG1 and will be helpful for its manipulation aiming at dissecting its function in plants."

"19736782","abstracttext","A choice test revealed that Hessian fly, Mayetiola destructor (Say) (Diptera: Cecidomyiidae), adults deposited approximately 3 times more eggs on wheat (Triticum spp.), seedlings than on barley (Hordeum spp.) or rice, Oryza sativa L., seedlings. On a barley seedling, 49.4% of eggs were deposited on either the abaxial leaf surface or the coleoptile and first leaf sheath (C&FLS), where newly hatched larvae die due to their inability to migrate into the interspace between leaf sheaths. In comparison, only 14% of eggs were deposited on the abaxial leaf surface or C&FLS on a wheat seedling. The average death rate of Hessian fly larvae in seedlings of an apparently susceptible barley line was 60%, compared with only 10% in seedlings of a susceptible wheat cultivar. The development of Hessian fly larvae was also much slower in barley seedlings than in wheat seedlings. It took 12 d for Hessian fly larvae to finish the first and second instars in susceptible barley seedlings, compared with 10 d in susceptible wheat seedlings under the same conditions. These results indicate that barley is not a good host for the Hessian fly. Our results also confirmed that rice is a nonhost for the Hessian fly. The resistance mechanism in rice was different from that in R gene resistant wheat. Hessian fly larvae grew a little and died more slowly in rice seedlings, whereas Hessian fly larvae died quickly without growth in resistant wheat."

"23724909","abstracttext_background","Hessian fly (Mayetiola destructor) is one of the most destructive pests of wheat. The genes encoding 12-oxo-phytodienoic acid reductase (OPR) and lipoxygenase (LOX) play critical roles in insect resistance pathways in higher plants, but little is known about genes controlling resistance to Hessian fly in wheat."
"23724909","abstracttext_results","In this study, 154 F6:8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) generated from a cross between two cultivars, 'Jagger' and '2174' of hexaploid wheat (2n = 6 × =42; AABBDD), were used to map genes associated with resistance to Hessian fly. Two QTLs were identified. The first one was a major QTL on chromosome 1A (QHf.osu-1A), which explained 70% of the total phenotypic variation. The resistant allele at this locus in cultivar 2174 could be orthologous to one or more of the previously mapped resistance genes (H9, H10, H11, H16, and H17) in tetraploid wheat. The second QTL was a minor QTL on chromosome 2A (QHf.osu-2A), which accounted for 18% of the total phenotypic variation. The resistant allele at this locus in 2174 is collinear to an Yr17-containing-fragment translocated from chromosome 2N of Triticum ventricosum (2n = 4 × =28; DDNN) in Jagger. Genetic mapping results showed that two OPR genes, TaOPR1-A and TaOPR2-A, were tightly associated with QHf.osu-1A and QHf.osu-2A, respectively. Another OPR gene and three LOX genes were mapped but not associated with Hessian fly resistance in the segregating population."

"24253015","articletitle","Genetic interactions between wheat and rye genomes in triticale : 1. Cytological results."
"24253015","abstracttext","Six primary triticale lines were produced from two advanced breeding lines of Triticum durum and three inbred genotypes of Secale cereale. The wheat and rye parents and the triticale derivatives were crossed in all possible combinations within each species group. Chiasma and univalent frequency of parents and hybrids were determined. The primary triticale lines had more univalents and less chiasmata per pollen mother cell than the corresponding wheat and rye parents together. The parental wheat F1 exhibited negative heterosis for chiasma frequency whereas all rye hybrids had much higher chiasma frequencies than their inbred parents. Triticale F1s generally showed lower chiasma frequencies and more univalents than their parents, but the degree of pairing failure was dependent upon which of the parental species within the triticale, wheat or rye, was in the heterozygous state. F1s with heterozygous wheat genome only showed the least reduction in chiasma number (presumably caused by gene actions within the wheat genome), while F1s with heterozygous rye genome showed high reduction in chiasma frequency and an increase in pairing failure (induced by negative interactions between the heterozygous rye and the wheat genome in triticale). A high correlation was found between the frequency of undisturbed pollen mother cells and the frequency of aneuploids in the subsequent generation. A higher number of aneuploids occurred in those populations which were heterozygous for the rye genome."

"24553964","abstracttext_key message","Chromosomes 5A (u) , 5S and 5D can be isolated from wild progenitors, providing a chromosome-based approach to develop tools for breeding and to study the genome evolution of wheat. The three subgenomes of hexaploid bread wheat originated from Triticum urartu (A(u)A(u)), from a species similar to Aegilops speltoides (SS) (progenitor of the B genome), and from Ae. tauschii (DD). Earlier studies indicated the potential of chromosome genomics to assist gene transfer from wild relatives of wheat and discover novel genes for wheat improvement. This study evaluates the potential of flow cytometric chromosome sorting in the diploid progenitors of bread wheat. Flow karyotypes obtained by analysing DAPI-stained chromosomes were characterized and the contents of the chromosome peaks were determined. FISH analysis with repetitive DNA probes proved that chromosomes 5A(u), 5S and 5D could be sorted with purities of 78-90 %, while the remaining chromosomes could be sorted in groups of three. Twenty-five conserved orthologous set (COS) markers covering wheat homoeologous chromosome groups 1-7 were used for PCR with DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA. These assays validated the cytomolecular results as follows: peak I on flow karyotypes contained chromosome groups 1, 4 and 6, peak II represented homoeologous group 5, while peak III consisted of groups 2, 3 and 7. The isolation of individual chromosomes of wild progenitors provides an attractive opportunity to investigate the structure and evolution of the polyploid genome and to deliver tools for wheat improvement."

"25186168","abstracttext_key message","Development of a high-density SNP map and evaluation of QTL shed light on domestication events in tetraploid wheat and the potential utility of cultivated emmer wheat for durum wheat improvement. Cultivated emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccum) is tetraploid and considered as one of the eight founder crops that spawned the Agricultural Revolution about 10,000 years ago. Cultivated emmer has non-free-threshing seed and a somewhat fragile rachis, but mutations in genes governing these and other agronomic traits occurred that led to the formation of today's fully domesticated durum wheat (T. turgidum ssp. durum). Here, we evaluated a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between a cultivated emmer accession and a durum wheat variety. A high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based genetic linkage map consisting of 2,593 markers was developed for the identification of quantitative trait loci. The major domestication gene Q had profound effects on spike length and compactness, rachis fragility, and threshability as expected. The cultivated emmer parent contributed increased spikelets per spike, and the durum parent contributed higher kernel weight, which led to the identification of some RILs that had significantly higher grain weight per spike than either parent. Threshability was governed not only by the Q locus, but other loci as well including Tg-B1 on chromosome 2B and a putative Tg-A1 locus on chromosome 2A indicating that mutations in the Tg loci occurred during the transition of cultivated emmer to the fully domesticated tetraploid. These results not only shed light on the events that shaped wheat domestication, but also demonstrate that cultivated emmer is a useful source of genetic variation for the enhancement of durum varieties."

"28878329","abstracttext","There is an urgent need for the improvement of drought-tolerant bread and durum wheat. The huge and complex genome of bread wheat (BBAADD genome) stands as a vital obstruction for understanding the molecular mechanism underlying drought tolerance. However, tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp., BBAA genome) is an ancestor of modern bread wheat and offers an important model for studying the drought response due to its less complex genome. Additionally, several wild relatives of tetraploid wheat have already shown a significant drought tolerance. We sequenced root transcriptome of three tetraploid wheat varieties with varying stress tolerance profiles, and built differential expression library of their transcripts under control and drought conditions. More than 5,000 differentially expressed transcripts were identified from each genotype. Functional characterization of transcripts specific to drought-tolerant genotype, revealed their association with osmolytes production and secondary metabolite pathways. Comparative analysis of differentially expressed genes and their non-coding RNA partners, long noncoding RNAs and microRNAs, provided valuable insight to gene expression regulation in response to drought stress. LncRNAs as well as coding transcripts share similar structural features in different tetraploid species; yet, lncRNAs slightly differ from coding transcripts. Several miRNA-lncRNA target pairs were detected as differentially expressed in drought stress. Overall, this study suggested an important pool of transcripts where their manipulations confer a better performance of wheat varieties under drought stress."

"29164273","abstracttext_key message","The new stem rust resistance gene Sr60 was fine-mapped to the distal region of chromosome arm 5A m S, and the TTKSK-effective gene SrTm5 could be a new allele of Sr22. The emergence and spread of new virulent races of the wheat stem rust pathogen (Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici; Pgt), including the Ug99 race group, is a serious threat to global wheat production. In this study, we mapped and characterized two stem rust resistance genes from diploid wheat Triticum monococcum accession PI 306540. We mapped SrTm5, a previously postulated gene effective to Ug99, on chromosome arm 7A m L, completely linked to Sr22. SrTm5 displayed a different race specificity compared to Sr22 indicating that they are distinct. Sequencing of the Sr22 homolog in PI 306540 revealed a novel haplotype. Characterization of the segregating populations with Pgt race QFCSC revealed an additional resistance gene on chromosome arm 5A m S that was assigned the official name Sr60. This gene was also effective against races QTHJC and SCCSC but not against TTKSK (a Ug99 group race). Using two large mapping populations (4046 gametes), we mapped Sr60 within a 0.44 cM interval flanked by sequenced-based markers GH724575 and CJ942731. These two markers delimit a 54.6-kb region in Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 4 and a 430-kb region in the Chinese Spring reference genome. Both regions include a leucine-rich repeat protein kinase (LRRK123.1) that represents a potential candidate gene. Three CC-NBS-LRR genes were found in the colinear Brachypodium region but not in the wheat genome. We are currently developing a Bacterial Artificial Chromosome library of PI 306540 to determine which of these candidate genes are present in the T. monococcum genome and to complete the cloning of Sr60."
"17123111","articletitle","Wheat VIN3-like PHD finger genes are up-regulated by vernalization."
"17123111","abstracttext","The term 'vernalization' describes the acceleration of the transition between the vegetative and reproductive stages after exposing plants to an extended period of low temperature. In Arabidopsis, vernalization promotes flowering by silencing the flowering repressor gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Mitotically stable repression of FLC is the result of chromatin modifications mediated by the Vernalization-INsensitive 3 (VIN3) and VIN3-Like (VIL) proteins. In this study, we identified and characterized three VIL genes in diploid wheat (Triticum monococcum L.), named TmVIL1, TmVIL2, and TmVIL3. Similar to Arabidopsis VIN3, all three wheat VIL proteins carry three conserved domains including a plant homeodomain finger motif (PHD), a fibronectin type III domain (FNIII), and a VIN3 interacting domain (VID). Genetic mapping placed TmVIL1, TmVIL2, and TmVIL3 loci in the centromeric regions of chromosome 5, 6, and 1, respectively. The chromosome location of TmVIL1 is close to that of the vernalization gene VRN-D5, but more precise mapping information is required to validate this relationship. Transcription of the wheat VIL genes was up-regulated by vernalization, with a peak after 4-6 weeks of cold treatment. When transferred back to warm conditions, transcript levels of the wheat VIL genes returned to pre-vernalization levels. In addition, the transcript levels of wheat VIL genes are affected by photoperiod. This study indicates that wheat VIL genes have retained a similar structure and transcriptional regulation as their Arabidopsis VIN3/VIL homologues, suggesting that they might have retained some of their functions."

"19641998","abstracttext","P23k is a 23 kDa protein involved in sugar translocation in the scutellum of germinating barley seeds. The present study was carried out to provide the genomic characterization for P23k gene in terms of copy number, chromosome mapping, genetic mapping and expression analysis in germinating sculletum in two major Triticeae crops, barley and wheat, and their relatives. Southern blotting showed that a variable copy number with different restriction fragment sizes was found among 15 Hordeum accessions, while low copy number were found to be conserved in 23 Triticum and 3 Aegilops accessions. Genetic and physical mapping study identified that the P23k gene is duplicated in wild and cultivated barley on chromosomes 1H, 2H, and 3H, and further tandem duplication on chromosomes 1H and 3H. In contrast, the wheat P23k is located on chromosome 3A of durum wheat and at the distal portion of the long arms of 3A and 3D chromosomes of bread wheat. Northern blotting showed remarkably high accumulation of P23k transcript in the germinating scutellum in cultivated and wild barley, whereas very few or no accumulation was detected in diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid wheat accessions. The present study suggests a simple scenario where the ancestral P23k is encoded on the distal portion of an ancestral chromosome of homoeologous chromosome 3. Beside of polyploidy, dispersed and tandem duplications could trigger generation of the P23k family in the Hordeum lineage, while an ancestral P23k has been conserved in homoeologous 3A and 3D chromosomes in the wheat lineage."

"22639190","abstracttext","The sequence data from 5' UTR, intronic, coding and 3' UTR regions of Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1 were investigated for a total of 158 accessions of emmer wheat landraces comprising 19 of wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides), 45 of hulled emmer wheat (T. dicoccum) and 94 of free-threshing (FT) emmer wheat (T. durum etc.). We detected some novel types of deletions in the coding regions from 22 hulled emmer accessions and 20 FT emmer accessions. Emmer wheat accessions with these deletions could produce predicted proteins likely to lack function. We also observed some novel mutations in Ppd-B1. Sixty-seven and forty-one haplotypes were found in Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1, respectively. Some mutations found in this study have not been known, so they have potential for useful genetic resources for wheat breeding. On the basis of sequence data from the 5' UTR region, both Ppd-A1 and Ppd-B1 haplotypes were divided into two groups (Type AI/AII and Type BI/BII). Types AI and AII of Ppd-A1 suggested gene flow between wild and hulled emmer. On the other hand, Types BI and BII of Ppd-B1 suggested gene flow between wild and FT emmer. More than half of hulled emmer accessions were Type AII/BI but few FT emmer accessions were of this type. Therefore, over half of the hulled emmer did not contribute to evolution of FT emmer."

"21468676","abstracttext","The genome sequences of rice (Oryza sativa L.) and Brachypodium distachyon and the comprehensive Triticeae EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) resources provide invaluable information for comparative genomics analysis. The powdery mildew resistance gene, Pm6, which was introgressed into common wheat from Triticum timopheevii, was previously mapped to the wheat chromosome bin of 2BL [fraction length (FL) 0.50-1.00] with limited DNA markers. In this study, we saturated the Pm6 locus in wheat using the collinearity-based markers by extensively exploiting these genomic resources. All wheat ESTs located in the bin 2BL FL 0.50-1.00 and their corresponding orthologous genes on rice chromosome 4 were firstly used to develop STS (Sequence Tagged Site) markers. Those identified markers that flanked the Pm6 locus were then used to identify the collinear regions in the genomes of rice and Brachypodium. Triticeae ESTs with orthologous genes in these collinear regions were further used to develop new conserved markers for the fine mapping of Pm6. Using two F(2) populations derived from crosses of IGVI-465 × Prins and IGVI-466 × Prins, we mapped a total of 29 markers to the Pm6 locus. Among them, 14 markers were co-segregated with Pm6 in the IGVI-466/Prins population. Comparative genome analysis showed that the collinear region of the 29 linked markers covers a ~5.6-Mb region in chromosome 5L of Brachypodium and a ~6.0-Mb region in chromosome 4L of rice. The marker order is conserved between rice and Brachypodium, but re-arrangements are present in wheat. Comparative mapping in the two populations showed that two conserved markers (CINAU123 and CINAU127) flanked the Pm6 locus, and an LRR-receptor-like protein kinase cluster was identified in the collinear regions of Brachypodium and rice. This putative resistance gene cluster provides a potential target site for further fine mapping and cloning of Pm6. Moreover, the newly developed conserved markers closely linked to Pm6 can be used for the marker-assisted selection (MAS) of Pm6 in wheat breeding programs."

"26156223","abstracttext","Inflorescences of the tribe Triticeae, which includes wheat (Triticum sp. L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) are characterized by sessile spikelets directly borne on the main axis, thus forming a branchless spike. 'Compositum-Barley' and tetraploid 'Miracle-Wheat' (T. turgidum convar. compositum (L.f.) Filat.) display noncanonical spike-branching in which spikelets are replaced by lateral branch-like structures resembling small-sized secondary spikes. As a result of this branch formation 'Miracle-Wheat' produces significantly more grains per spike, leading to higher spike yield. In this study, we first isolated the gene underlying spike-branching in 'Compositum-Barley,' i.e., compositum 2 (com2). Moreover, we found that COM2 is orthologous to the branched head(t) (bh(t)) locus regulating spike branching in tetraploid 'Miracle-Wheat.' Both genes possess orthologs with similar functions in maize BRANCHED SILKLESS 1 (BD1) and rice FRIZZY PANICLE/BRANCHED FLORETLESS 1 (FZP/BFL1) encoding AP2/ERF transcription factors. Sequence analysis of the bh(t) locus in a collection of mutant and wild-type tetraploid wheat accessions revealed that a single amino acid substitution in the DNA-binding domain gave rise to the domestication of 'Miracle-Wheat.' mRNA in situ hybridization, microarray experiments, and independent qRT-PCR validation analyses revealed that the branch repression pathway in barley is governed through the spike architecture gene Six-rowed spike 4 regulating COM2 expression, while HvIDS1 (barley ortholog of maize INDETERMINATE SPIKELET 1) is a putative downstream target of COM2. These findings presented here provide new insights into the genetic basis of spike architecture in Triticeae, and have disclosed new targets for genetic manipulations aiming at boosting wheat's yield potential."

"32355611","abstracttext","Tilletia species cause diseases on grass hosts with some causing bunt diseases on wheat ( Triticum ). Two of the four species infecting wheat have restricted distributions globally and are subject to quarantine regulations to prevent their spread to new areas. Tilletia indica causes Karnal bunt and is regulated by many countries while the non-regulated T. walkeri is morphologically similar and very closely related phylogenetically, but infects ryegrass ( Lolium ) and not wheat. Tilletia controversa causes dwarf bunt of wheat (DB) and is also regulated by some countries, while the closely related but non-regulated species, T. caries and T. laevis , both cause common bunt of wheat (CB). Historically, diagnostic methods have relied on cryptic morphology to differentiate these species in subsamples from grain shipments. Of the DNA-based methods published so far, most have focused on sequence variation among tested strains at a single gene locus. To facilitate the development of additional molecular assays for diagnostics, we generated whole genome data for multiple strains of the two regulated wheat pathogens and their closest relatives. Depending on the species, the genomes were assembled into 907 to 4633 scaffolds ranging from 24 Mb to 30 Mb with 7842 to 9952 gene models predicted. Phylogenomic analyses confirmed the placement of Tilletia in the Exobasidiomycetes and showed that T. indica and T. walkeri were in one clade whereas T. controversa , T. caries and T. laevis grouped in a separate clade. Single copy and species-specific genes were identified by orthologous group analysis. Unique species-specific genes were identified and evaluated as suitable markers to differentiate the quarantine and non-quarantine species. After further analyses and manual inspection, primers and probes for the optimum candidate genes were designed and tested in silico, for validation in future wet-lab studies."

"26066332","abstracttext","Powdery mildew (PM), caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici, is one of the important wheat diseases, worldwide. Two PM resistance genes, designated as PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2, were identified in T. boeoticum acc. pau5088 and mapped on chromosome 7AL approximately 48cM apart. Two resistance gene analogue (RGA)-STS markers Ta7AL-4556232 and 7AL-4426363 were identified to be linked to the PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2, at a distance of 0.6cM and 6.0cM, respectively. In the present study, following marker assisted selection (MAS), the two genes were transferred to T. aestivum using T. durum as bridging species. As many as 12,317 florets of F1 of the cross T. durum /T. boeoticum were pollinated with T. aestivum lines PBW343-IL and PBW621 to produce 61 and 65 seeds, respectively, of three-way F1. The resulting F1s of the cross T. durum/T. boeoticum//T. aestivum were screened with marker flanking both the PM resistance genes PmTb7A.1 and PmTb7A.2 (foreground selection) and the selected plants were backcrossed to generate BC1F1. Marker assisted selection was carried both in BC1F1 and the BC2F1 generations. Introgression of alien chromatin in BC2F1 plants varied from 15.4-62.9 percent. Out of more than 110 BC2F1 plants showing introgression for markers linked to the two PM resistance genes, 40 agronomically desirable plants were selected for background selection for the carrier chromosome to identify the plants with minimum of the alien introgression. Cytological analysis showed that most plants have chromosome number ranging from 40-42. The BC2F2 plants homozygous for the two genes have been identified. These will be crossed to generate lines combining both the PM resistance genes but with minimal of the alien introgression. The PM resistance gene PmTb7A.1 maps in a region very close to Sr22, a stem rust resistance gene effective against the race Ug99. Analysis of selected plants with markers linked to Sr22 showed introgression of Sr22 from T. boeoticum in several BC2F1 plants. Thus, in addition to PM resistance, these progeny might also carry resistance to stem rust race Ug99."

"27300207","abstracttext","Allopolyploidization induces a multiple processes of genomic reorganization, including the structurally functional diversification of the homoeologous genes. An example of such diversification is the appearance of the Lr34 gene on chromosome 7D of bread wheat T. aestivum (BAD), the gene conferring durable, race non-specific protection against three fungal pathogens. In this study, we focused on the variability of a functionally critical region between exons 10-12 of Lr34 among diploid progenitors of wheat genomes and their respective polyploids. In the diploid A-genome species, two basic forms of the studied region have been revealed: (1) non-functional forms containing stop codons, or/and frameshifts (T. monococcum/T. urartu) and (2) forms with no such a mutations (T. boeoticum). The Lr34 sequence of T. urartu containing a TGA stop codon was inherited by the first tetraploid T. dicoccoides (BA), and then reorganized in some accessions of this species due to the insertion of an LTR retroelement in exon 10. Besides T. boeoticum, the second form of the Lr34 sequence is also characteristic of A. speltoides, which presumably donated this form to all polyploid descendants bearing B-genome. No differences were found between the D-genome-specific Lr34 sequences studied here and downloaded from databases, implying the highest level of conservation of the Lr34 predecessor throughout evolution. The sequence data were later used to construct phylograms, and apparent peculiarities in the evolution of the studied region of Lr34 genes discussed."

"8349131","abstracttext","Development of a high-density genetic linkage map of cultivated wheats using conventional molecular markers has lagged behind the other major food crops such as rice and tomato because of the large genome size and limited levels of genetic polymorphisms. Recently, random amplified polymorphic DNAs (RAPDs) have been suggested to provide an alternative to visualize more polymorphism. For the construction of a genetic linkage map in tetraploid wheats, one can use a strategy of intersubspecific crosses between the most dissimilar wild and cultivated tetraploid wheats that are easy to hybridize and result in fertile progeny. An assessment of the level of RAPDs among different accessions and varieties of wild and cultivated tetraploid wheats is required to fulfill this objective. We present here the data obtained using RAPD analysis of 40 primers in 20 accessions of wild tetraploid emmer wheats (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. dicoccoides) and 10 genotypes of cultivated tetraploid durum wheats (Triticum turgidum L. ssp. durum) selected from geographically diverse locations. We have observed a higher level of polymorphism among different accessions of wild emmer wheat from Israel. Turkey, and Jordan than the group of cultivated American, Turkish, and Syrian durum wheats. These data have been used to generate a dendrogram suggesting the genetic relationships among these genotypes, and the most dissimilar genotypes are identified for future mapping and gene tagging work."

"30969996","abstracttext","The tetraploid wheat species Triticum turgidum and Triticum timopheevii are morphologically similar, and misidentification of material collected from the wild is possible. We compared published sequences for the Ppd-A1, Ppd-B1 and Ppd-G1 genes from multiple accessions of T. turgidum and T. timopheevii and devised a set of four polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), two specific for Ppd-B1 and two for Ppd-G1. We used these PCRs with 51 accessions of T. timopheevii and 20 of T. turgidum. Sixty of these accessions gave PCR products consistent with their taxon identifications, but the other eleven accessions gave anomalous results: ten accessions that were classified as T. turgidum were identified as T. timopheevii by the PCRs, and one T. timopheevii accession was typed as T. turgidum. We believe that these anomalies are not due to errors in the PCR tests because the results agree with a more comprehensive analysis of genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms, which similarly suggest that these eleven accessions have been misclassified. Our results therefore show that the accepted morphological tests for discrimination between T. turgidum and T. timopheevii might not be entirely robust, but that species identification can be made cheaply and quickly by PCRs directed at the Ppd-1 gene."
"24218593","articletitle","Intrinsic karyotype stability and gene copy number variations may have laid the foundation for tetraploid wheat formation."
"24218593","abstracttext","Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication is recurrent in plant evolution, yet only a small fraction of whole-genome duplications has led to successful speciation. A major challenge in the establishment of nascent polyploids is sustained karyotype instability, which compromises fitness. The three putative diploid progenitors of bread wheat, with AA, SS (S ∼ B), and DD genomes occurred sympatrically, and their cross-fertilization in different combinations may have resulted in fertile allotetraploids with various genomic constitutions. However, only SSAA or closely related genome combinations have led to the speciation of tetraploid wheats like Triticum turgidum and Triticum timopheevii. We analyzed early generations of four newly synthesized allotetraploid wheats with genome compositions S(sh)S(sh)A(m)A(m), S(l)S(l)AA, S(b)S(b)DD, and AADD by combined fluorescence and genomic in situ hybridization-based karyotyping. Results of karyotype analyses showed that although S(sh)S(sh)A(m)A(m) and S(l)S(l)AA are characterized by immediate and persistent karyotype stability, massive aneuploidy and extensive chromosome restructuring are associated with S(b)S(b)DD and AADD in which parental subgenomes showed markedly different propensities for chromosome gain/loss and rearrangements. Although compensating aneuploidy and reciprocal translocation between homeologs prevailed, reproductive fitness was substantially compromised due to chromosome instability. Strikingly, localized genomic changes in repetitive DNA and copy-number variations in gene homologs occurred in both chromosome stable lines, S(sh)S(sh)A(m)A(m) and S(l)S(l)AA. Our data demonstrated that immediate and persistent karyotype stability is intrinsic to newly formed allotetraploid wheat with genome combinations analogous to natural tetraploid wheats. This property, coupled with rapid gene copy-number variations, may have laid the foundation of tetraploid wheat establishment."

"33298661","abstracttext","This study examined the relationship between host plant and rhizospheric bacterial community structure, including composition and diversity, in Triticum and Aegilops species (12 and two accessions, respectively) as well as three closely related species, barley, rye and oat (four accessions), to explore the possibility that wheat root and rhizosphere interaction can be utilized for wheat breeding and biotechnology in the future. For this purpose, DNA was isolated from rhizospheric soil samples and one control non-rhizospheric soil sample, and the 16S rRNA gene region was amplified and subjected to DNA pyrosequencing. A total of 132,888 amplicons were analyzed. Bacterial composition at the phylum level was similar among the 18 rhizospheric samples; however, the proportion of Acidobacteria was much lower in these samples than in the control non-rhizospheric soil sample, indicating that rhizospheres influenced the bacterial composition even at the higher taxonomic level. Across host plant genome types (three levels of ploidy and three major genomes, A, B and D), there was no detectable difference in phylum composition or species diversity. Estimated bacterial species diversity was higher in the control soil sample than in plant rhizospheric soils, implying that bacterial species diversity was reduced in rhizospheres. A PCoA plot and UPGMA dendrogram based on the bacterial species composition showed that control soil was distantly located from the plant rhizospheric samples and that Triticum, Aegilops and related species were well separated. PERMANOVA analysis detected statistically significant differentiation among these four groups. Clustering of Triticum species suggested that the A genome was dominant over the B and D genomes, with respect to the influence on rhizospheric bacterial species composition. Although the cause was not investigated in this study, these results clearly indicated that the genetic constitution of the plant host exerted a strong influence on rhizospheric bacterial community structure."

"12830387","abstracttext","Durum wheat ( Triticum turgidum ssp. durum, 2 n = 4 x = 28, genomes AB) is an economically important cereal used as the raw material to make pasta and semolina. In this paper we present the construction and characterization of a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library of tetraploid durum wheat cv. Langdon. This variety was selected because of the availability of substitution lines that facilitate the assignment of BACs to the A and B genome. The selected Langdon line has a 30-cM segment of chromosome 6BS from T. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides carrying a gene for high grain protein content, the target of a positional cloning effort in our laboratory. A total of 516,096 clones were organized in 1,344 384-well plates and blotted on 28 high-density filters. Ninety-eight percent of these clones had wheat DNA inserts (0.3% chloroplast DNA, 1.4% empty clones and 0.3% empty wells). The average insert size of 500 randomly selected BAC clones was 131 kb, resulting in a coverage of 5.1-fold genome equivalents for each of the two genomes, and a 99.4% probability of recovering any gene from each of the two genomes of durum wheat. Six known copy-number probes were used to validate this theoretical coverage and gave an estimated coverage of 5.8-fold genome equivalents. Screening of the library with 11 probes related to grain storage proteins and starch biosynthesis showed that the library contains several clones for each of these genes, confirming the value of the library in characterizing the organization of these important gene families. In addition, characterization of fingerprints from colinear BACs from the A and B genomes showed a large differentiation between the A and B genomes. This library will be a useful tool for evolutionary studies in one of the best characterized polyploid systems and a source of valuable genes for wheat.

"20686747","abstracttext","Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is one of the most important wheat diseases worldwide and breeding for resistance using diversified disease resistance genes is the most promising approach to prevent outbreaks of powdery mildew. A powdery mildew resistance gene, originating from wild emmer wheat (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) accessions collected from Israel, has been transferred into the hexaploid wheat line 3D232 through crossing and backcrossing. Inoculation results with 21 B. graminis f. sp. tritici races indicated that 3D232 is resistant to all of the powdery mildew isolates tested. Genetic analyses of 3D232 using an F(2) segregating population and F(3) families indicated that a single dominant gene, Ml3D232, confers resistance in the host seedling stage. By applying molecular markers and bulked segregant analysis (BSA), we have identified polymorphic simple sequence repeats (SSR), expressed sequence tags (EST) and derived sequence tagged site (STS) markers to determine that the Ml3D232 is located on chromosome 5BL bin 0.59-0.76. Comparative genetic analyses using mapped EST markers and genome sequences of rice and Brachypodium established co-linearity of the Ml3D232 genomic region with a 1.4 Mb genomic region on Brachypodium distachyon chromosome 4, and a 1.2 Mb contig located on the Oryza sativa chromosome 9. Our comparative approach enabled us to develop new EST-STS markers and to delimit the genomic region carrying Ml3D232 to a 0.8 cM segment that is collinear with a 558 kb region on B. distachyon. Eight EST markers, including an NBS-LRR analog, co-segregated with Ml3D232 to provide a target site for fine genetic mapping, chromosome landing and map-based cloning of the powdery mildew resistance gene. This newly developed common wheat germplasm provides broad-spectrum resistance to powdery mildew and a valuable resource for wheat breeding programs."

"26847646","abstracttext_key message","The wheat stripe rust resistance gene Yr36 ( WKS1 ) with a unique kinase-START domain architecture is highly conserved in wild emmer wheat natural populations. Wild emmer wheat (Triticum dicoccoides) populations have developed various resistance strategies against the stripe rust pathogen Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst). The wild emmer gene, Yr36 (WKS1), which confers partial resistance to a broad spectrum of Pst races, is composed of a kinase and a START lipid-binding domain, a unique gene architecture found only in the Triticeae tribe. The analysis of 435 wild emmer accessions from a broad range of natural habitats revealed that WKS1 and its paralogue WKS2 are present only in the southern distribution range of wild emmer in the Fertile Crescent, supporting the idea that wheat domestication occurred in the northern populations. An analysis of full-length WKS1 sequence from 54 accessions identified 15 different haplotypes and very low-nucleotide diversity (π = 0.00019). The high level of WKS1 sequence conservation among wild emmer populations is in contrast to the high level of diversity previously observed in NB-LRR genes (e.g., Lr10 and Pm3). This phenomenon may reflect the different resistance mechanisms and different evolutionary pathways that shaped these genes, and may shed light on the evolution of genes that confer partial resistance to stripe rust. Only five WKS1 coding sequence haplotypes were revealed among all tested accessions, encoding four different putative WKS1 proteins (designated P0, P1, P2, and P3). Infection tests showed that P0, P1, and P3 haplotypes display a resistance response, while P2 displayed a susceptible response. These results show that the WKS1 proteins (P0, P1, and P3) can be useful to improve wheat resistance to stripe rust."
"27959972","articletitle","A New Map Location of Gene Stb3 for Resistance to Septoria Tritici Blotch in Wheat."
"27959972","abstracttext","Septoria tritici blotch (STB), caused by Mycosphaerella graminicola (synonym: Zymoseptoria tritici ; asexual stage: Septoria tritici ), is an important disease of wheat worldwide. Management of the disease usually is by host resistance or fungicides. However, M. graminicola has developed insensitivity to most commonly applied fungicides so there is a continuing need for well-characterized sources of host resistance to accelerate the development of improved wheat cultivars. Gene Stb3 has been a useful source of major resistance, but its mapping location has not been well characterized. Based on linkage to a single marker, a previous study assigned Stb3 to a location on the short arm of chromosome 6D. However, the results from the present study show that this reported location is incorrect. Instead, linkage analysis revealed that Stb3 is located on the short arm of wheat chromosome 7A, completely linked to microsatellite (SSR) locus Xwmc83 and flanked by loci Xcfa2028 (12.4 cM distal) and Xbarc222 (2.1 cM proximal). Linkage between Stb3 and Xwmc83 was validated in BC 1 F 3 progeny of other crosses, and analyses of the flanking markers with deletion stocks showed that the gene is located on 7AS between fraction lengths 0.73 and 0.83. This revised location of Stb3 is different from those for other STB resistance genes previously mapped in hexaploid wheat but is approximately 20 cM proximal to an STB resistance gene mapped on the short arm of chromosome 7A m in Triticum monococcum . The markers described in this study are useful for accelerating the deployment of Stb3 in wheat breeding programs."

"8082167","abstracttext","Mitochondrial (mt)DNA of Secale cereale contains an open reading frame (pol-r), the potential translation product of which shows significant homology to the type-B DNA polymerase encoded by the S1 plasmid of Zea mays; it contains the highly-conserved domains IIa to V of family B polymerases. The pol-r ORF is transcribed, as proven by RT-PCR, but the transcript is not edited. Upstream of the putative start codon a potential promoter motif was detected, fitting well into the postulated consensus sequence of the transcription initiation regions of Z. mays and Triticum aestivum. The pol-r ORF occurs in mtDNA of the fertile rye variety ""Halo"" and the cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) line ""Pampa"". Both ORFs are almost identical, apart from the 3' terminus; pol-r from Halo can code for 289 amino acids, pol-r from Pampa for 312 amino acids. Based on codon usage and the lack of editing, pol-r is considered to be a ""young"" gene, probably introduced in the mtDNA of rye by recombination with an mt plasmid."

"9139127","abstracttext","Complementary DNAs involved in potassium transport in Schizosaccharomyces pombe were selected by complementation of defective K+ uptake in a trk1 trk2 mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here we describe the SpTRK gene that encodes a protein of 833 amino acids. The predicted structure contains 12 putative membrane-spanning domains and resembles various high- and low-affinity systems for K+ transport in yeasts and plants. TKHp, the product of SpTRK exhibits high homology to TRK1 and TRK2 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae as well as to HKT1 of Triticum aestivum, but is not related to HAK1 of another ascomycete, Schwanniomyces occidentalis, suggesting that different routes for potassium uptake evolved independently. This protein is a potassium-specific transporter since functional analysis of the SpTRK complemented mutant strain of Sacch. cerevisiae revealed potassium transport affinities and uptake characteristics similar to those obtained in wild-type Sch. pombe. Patch-clamp analysis in the whole-cell mode confirmed the TKHp-mediated inward current in the complemented strain. The inward current increased by acidification of the extracellular medium thereby suggesting a mechanism of K+H+ cotransport. The inward current is not detectable when external K+ is substituted by Na+, documenting a distinct cation specificity of the protein."

"15337597","abstracttext","Fusarium langsethiae was recently described as a new toxigenic Fusarium species, which morphologically resembles Fusarium poae, but exhibits a mycotoxin pattern related to Fusarium sporotrichioides. To develop tools for early and specific detection of F. langsethiae and distinguishing it from related species of section Sporotrichiella and Discolor (F. poae, F. sporotrichioides, Fusarium kyushuense, Fusarium robustum, Fusarium sambucinum and Fusarium tumidum) sequence variations in their beta-tubulin-encoding (tub1) gene were employed to design two PCR-based methods, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS)-PCR. DGGE reliably separated all these strains, even from mixtures and in the presence of DNA from their natural hosts Zea mais, Triticum aestivum and Avena sativa. In addition, a tetraprimer ARMS-PCR, which employs two primer pairs to amplify, respectively, two different fragments of tub1 in a single PCR reaction resulted in rapid differentiation between F. langsethiae, F. sporotrichioides and F. poae according to the number of amplicons (four, two and one, respectively). These two methods will thus be worthwhile tools in the specific detection of F. langsethiae in infected crops."

"18688729","abstracttext","Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) play a central role in detoxification processes of aldehydes generated in plants when exposed to the stressed conditions. In order to identify genes required for the stresses responses in the grass crop Zea mays, an ALDH (ZmALDH22A1) gene was isolated and characterized. ZmALDH22A1 belongs to the family ALDH22 that is currently known only in plants. The ZmALDH22A1 encodes a protein of 593 amino acids that shares high identity with the orthologs from Saccharum officinarum (95%), Oryza sativa (89%), Triticum aestivum (87%) and Arabidopsis thaliana (77%), respectively. Real-time PCR analysis indicates that ZmALDH22A1 is expressed differentially in different tissues. Various elevated levels of ZmALDH22A1 expression have been detected when the seedling roots exposed to abiotic stresses including dehydration, high salinity and abscisic acid (ABA). Tomato stable transformation of construct expressing the ZmALDH22A1 signal peptide fused with yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) driven by the CaMV35S-promoter reveals that the fusion protein is targeted to plastid. Transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing ZmALDH22A1 shows elevated stresses tolerance. Stresses tolerance in transgenic plants is accompanied by a reduction of malondialdehyde (MDA) derived from cellular lipid peroxidation."

"19937265","abstracttext","A newly isolated novel bacterium from sediments contaminated with dyestuff was identified as Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain BCH by 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis. The bacterium was extraordinarily active and operative over a wide rage of temperature (10-60 degrees C) and salinity (5-6%), for decolorization of Direct Orange 39 (Orange TGLL) at optimum pH 7. This strain was capable of decolorizing Direct Orange 39; 50 mg l(-1) within 45 +/- 5 min, with 93.06% decolorization, while maximally it could decolorize 1.5 g l(-1) of dye within 48 h with 60% decolorization. Analytical studies as, UV-Vis spectroscopy, FTIR, HPLC were employed to confirm the biodegradation of dye and formation of new metabolites. Induction in the activities of lignin peroxidases, DCIP reductase as well as tyrosinase was observed, indicating the significant role of these enzymes in biodegradation of Direct Orange 39. Toxicity studies with Phaseolus mungo and Triticum aestivum revealed the non-toxic nature of degraded metabolites."

"19828160","abstracttext","The genome of Brachypodium distachyon, also known as purple false brome, was fully sequenced in 2008 largely in response to the demand for a model plant for temperate grasses. A comparative study of the primary cell walls of seedlings of B. distachyon, Hordeum vulgare and Triticum aestivum was carried out. The cell walls of the three species were characterized by similar relative levels of, and developmental changes in, hemicelluloses. The occurrence of (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucans was correlated with phases of growth involving cell elongation. Expression profiling of the genes involved in (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucan synthesis (cellulose synthase-like F family (CSLF), CSLH and a putative synthase gene CSLJ) did not show a transcriptional regulation that corresponded to the abundance of (1,3;1,4)-beta-D-glucans. CSLF6 transcripts were similarly highly expressed in all three grasses, and were much more abundant than any of the other transcripts. The CSLH transcript was relatively abundant in B. distachyon but almost undetectable in the other species. The deposition of arabinoxylans increased steadily during seedling growth in all three grasses, but they became less substituted and more cross-linked into the wall matrix during cell maturation. Moreover, arabinoxylans in B. distachyon differed from the two other grasses in having a lower degree of arabinose substitution, a higher percentage of ferulic acid in form of dimers and a larger proportion of ester-linked p-coumaric acid."

A phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence placed the isolate within the genus Paenibacillus, being most closely related to Paenibacillus graminis RSA19(T) (98.1 % similarity). The isolate was a Gram-reaction-variable, motile, facultatively anaerobic bacterium, with spores in a terminal position in cells. Starch was utilized and dihydroxyacetone and catalase were produced. Strain SBR5(T) displayed plant-growth-promoting rhizobacteria characteristics: the ability to fix nitrogen and to produce siderophores and indole-3-acetic acid. The DNA G+C content was 55.1 mol%. Chemotaxonomic analysis of the isolated strain revealed that MK-7 was the predominant menaquinone, while the major fatty acid was anteiso-C(15 : 0). DNA-DNA hybridization values between strain SBR5(T) and P. graminis RSA19(T), Paenibacillus odorifer TOD45(T) and Paenibacillus borealis KK19(T) were 43, 35 and 28 %, respectively. These DNA relatedness data and the results of phylogenetic and phenotypic analyses showed that strain SBR5(T) should be considered as the nitrogen-fixing type strain of a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus riograndensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SBR5(T) (=CCGB 1313(T) =CECT 7330(T))."

"23564445","abstracttext","We measured the level of VRN-B1 transcripts within near-isogenic lines of Triticum aestivum cultivar 'Bezostaya 1' carrying two VRN-B1 alleles from cultivars 'Saratovskaya 29' and 'Diamant 2' (VRN-B1c and VRN-B1a, respectively). Both lines have similar kinetics of VRN-B1 transcript accumulation at the third to fifth leaf stages. However, quantitative PCR analysis at the third leaf stage showed that the VRN-B1c allele was transcribed 10 times faster than the VRN-B1a allele. The F1 hybrid between the lines is more similar to the line carrying the VRN-B1a allele with regard to the level of VRN-B1 transcription. The difference in the transcript levels of the VRN-B1 alleles appears to be due to the previously identified structural changes in the first intron of VRN-B1c (deletion of 0.8 kb and duplication of 0.4 kb) as compared with VRN-B1a, as no other differences were revealed in the present study. We suggested that the first intron structural changes in the VRN-B1c allele as compared with VRN-B1a result in a higher level of VRN-B1 transcripts and an earlier heading time. We confirmed that the expression of the dominant VRN-1 gene induces transcription of the recessive homoeoalleles, coupled with the reduction of the transcript level of a flowering repressor VRN-2."

"26124763","abstracttext","Dehydrins (DHNs), group 2 of late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, are up-regulated in most plants during cold, drought, heat, or salinity stress. All DHNs contain at least one K-segment, which is believed to play a significant role in DHN function by forming an amphipathic helix. In previous studies, wzy2, an YSK2-type DHN gene, was isolated from the Zhengyin 1 cultivar of Triticum aestivum under cold and drought stress treatment conditions. Four WZY2 truncated derivatives were constructed to knock out the K-, Y- or S-segment, which potentially affect the function of the protein. In vivo assays of Escherichia coli viability enhancement, in vitro lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity protection and ex vivo protein aggregation prevention assays revealed that WZY2 acted as a protectant and improved stress tolerance during temperature variation. The results also showed that unlike the truncated derivative without K-segments, the derivative containing two K-segments had remarkable effects that were similar to those of full-length WZY2, indicating that the K-segment is the major functional component of WZY2. Moreover, compared with the other segments, the first K-segment might be the most critical contributor to WZY2 functionality. In general, this work highlights the behavior of DHNs in relieving cold stress ex vivo and the contribution of the K-segment to DHN function."

"25431405","abstracttext","The reaction to soil drying was evaluated in two Triticum aestivum near-isogenic lines carrying different alleles of the height-reducing gene Rht-B1 based on an improved method for assessment of electrolyte leakage. The two lines were previously shown to differ in their physiological responses to induced water deficit stress. Drought was imposed for 6 days on 10-day-old seedlings. Ion efflux from leaves was measured conductometrically in multiple time points during the 24 h incubation period, and the obtained biphasic kinetics was interpreted according to a previously developed theoretical model proposing different leakage rates through the apoplast and the symplast. Most of the model parameters were able to properly differentiate the two closely related genotypes. The mutant Rht-B1c displayed lower and slower electrolyte leakage in comparison with the wild-type Rht-B1a. It was speculated that the Rht genes expressing defective DELLA proteins might be involved in water stress response through modulation of cell wall stiffness, which influences its capacity for ions retention, and also by their contribution to ROS detoxification, thus indirectly stabilizing cellular membranes. The presented analytical approach relating processes of ion and water flow in and out of the cell could be used for characterization of membrane and cell wall properties of different genotypes under normal and stress conditions."

In this study, a putative WOX2 homolog was isolated and characterized from Aegilops tauschii, the donor of D genome of Triticum aestivum. The sequence consisted of 2045 bp, and contained an open reading frame (ORF), encoded 322 amino acids. The predicted protein sequence contained a highly conserved homeodomain and the WUS-box domain, which is present in some members of the WOX protein family. The full-length ORF was subcloned into prokaryotic expression vector pET-30a, and an approximately 34-kDa protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells with IPTG induction. The molecular mass of the expressed protein was identical to that predicted by the cDNA sequence. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that Ae. tauschii WOX2 is closely related to the rice and maize orthologs. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that WOX2 from Ae. tauschii was primarily expressed in the seeds; transcription increased during seed development and declined after the embryos matured, suggesting that WOX2 is associated with embryo development in Ae. tauschii."

The results indicated that the MwCP protein was a new member of the papain C1A family, and it was predicted to be an extracellular, secretory stable hydrophilic protein. The secondary structure of MwCP was mainly composed of α-helices and random coils, and the space structure primarily contained α-helices, β-sheets, and β-turns. Homology analyses showed the 98% homology between MwCP amino acids and a cysteine protease found in Triticum aestivum (GenBank accession No. AAW21813.1). Analysis of mRNA using semi-quantitative RT-PCR indicated that during a 48-h drought stress period, MwCP was expressed during the 4th hour, and the expression level peaked during the 6th hour before declining to the original level. The results revealed that MwCP was involved in drought-resistant physiological processes of A. mongolicum. Moreover, the MwCP expression levels were highest in leaves, intermediate in roots, and lowest in stems."

"29227949","abstracttext","Drought is one of the major environmental stresses to plants. The calcium sensor, calcineurin B-like (CBL) proteins, and their interacting protein kinases (CIPK) play important roles in responding to abiotic stresses. In this study, we functionally characterized a CIPK gene from Triticum aestivum designated TaCIPK27. The transcriptional levels of TaCIPK27 were increased both in roots and leaves after treatment with polyethylene glycol 8000, abscisic acid and H 2 O 2 . Besides, TaCIPK27 interacted with AtCBL1, AtCBL3, AtCBL4, AtCBL5 and AtCBL9 in yeast two-hybrid assays. Ectopic overexpression of TaCIPK27 positively regulates drought tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis compared with controls, which was demonstrated by seed germination and survival rates experiments, as well as the detection of physiological indices including ion leakage, malonic dialdehyde and H 2 O 2 contents and antioxidant enzyme activities under normal and drought conditions. Moreover, higher concentration of endogenous abscisic acid was detected under drought in TaCIPK27 transgenic plants. In addition, TaCIPK27 transgenic plants were more sensitive to exogenous abscisic acid treatment at seed germination and seedling stage. The expression levels of somedrought stress and abscisic acid related genes were up-regulated in TaCIPK27 transgenic plants. The results suggest that TaCIPK27 functions as a positive regulator under drought partly in an ABA-dependent pathway."

The present study investigated the possible roles of small RNAs (sRNAs) in Gc action. By sequencing two small RNA libraries from the anthers of Triticum aestivum cv. Chinese Spring (CS) and the Chinese Spring-Gc 3C chromosome monosomic addition line (CS-3C), we identified 239 conserved and 72 putative novel miRNAs, including 135 differentially expressed miRNAs. These miRNAs were predicted to target multiple genes with various molecular functions relevant to the features of Gc action, including sterility and genome instability. The transgenic overexpression of miRNA, which was up-regulated in CS-3C, reduced rice fertility. The CS-3C line exhibited a genome-wide reduction in 24 nt siRNAs compared with that of the CS line, particularly in transposable element (TE) and repetitive DNA sequences. Corresponding to this reduction, the bisulfite sequencing analysis of four retro-TE sequences showed a decrease in CHH methylation, typical of RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM).

"30805376","abstracttext","Nitrate is one of the major sources of nitrogen for the growth of plants. It is taken up by plant roots and transported to the leaves where it is reduced to nitrite in the. The main objective of this research was to investigate stimulatory effects of sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonia and urea on the production/generation of the nitrate reductase mRNA in Triticum aestivum plants. The plants were grown in standard nutrient solution for 21 days and then starved in a media without nitrate for seven days. Starved plants were stimulated with various concentrations of sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, ammonia and urea, and the expression of nitrate reductase mRNA was analyzed by real-time PCR. Our results indicated that starvation caused significant decrease in the production of nitrate reductase mRNA in the plant leaf. Sodium and potassium nitrate were capable of restoring the production of nitrate mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, since 50 mM of each produced the highest level of the mRNA. The stimulatory effect of potassium nitrate was higher than sodium nitrate, while ammonia and urea did not show such activity. At low concentrations, sodium nitrate and potassium nitrate caused significant increase in the nitrate/nitrite mRNA production, whereas high concentrations of these salts suppressed the expression of this gene considerably."

"30078068","abstracttext","A Gram-positive, aerobic actinomycetes, designated strain SJ 21 T , was isolated from the rhizosphere soil of Triticum aestivum L. collected from Langfang, Hebei Province, Central China. Strain SJ 21 T with weak antifungal activity also contained genes (involved in antibiotics biosynthesis) of the nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), ketosynthase (KS) and methyl malonyl transferase domains (PKS-I) as well as KSα and KSβ domains (PKS-II). A polyphasic taxonomic study was carried out to establish the status of strain SJ 21 T . The strain formed spherical spore vesicles (7.0-8.9 µm) consisting of coiled and branched chains on aerial mycelia. 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity studies showed that strain SJ 21 T belongs to the genus Spirillospora and formed a distinct branch with its closest neighbour Spirillospora albida IFO 12248 T (98.7%). The morphological and chemotaxonomic properties of the strain are also consistent with those members of the genus Spirillospora. DNA-DNA hybridization experiments and phenotypic tests were carried out between strain SJ 21 T and S. albida, which further clarified their relatedness and demonstrated that SJ 21 T could be distinguished genomically from S. albida. Therefore, the strain is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Spirillospora, for which the name Spirillospora tritici sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SJ 21 T (=CGMCC 4.7420 T  =JCM 32390 T )."

A group of gene clusters and pathways associated with nitrogen fixation, plant-bacterial interactions, plant growth-promoting hormone synthesis, antibiotics, secondary metabolite, and disease resistance were identified. In addition, 0.06 mg/L of 3-indoleacrylic acid (IAA) and 2 mg/L of gibberellin (GA) were, respectively, detected in PDSLzg-1 fermentation broth by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Up-regulated expression levels of 11 key genes related to GA and IAA biosynthesis pathways were detected after the induction of 0.2% n-hexadecane. Furthermore, bioassays showed that PDSLzg-1 fermentation could significantly promote the length and biomass of the stems and roots of Triticum aestivum L., while inhibited Colletotrichum truncatum colonization. Results indicated that B. pumilus PDSLzg-1 had plant growth-promoting and antifungal functions, besides its potential applications in phyto-microbial bioremediation combinations for oil-contaminated soil."

"12582861","abstracttext","The powdery mildew resistance has been transferred from an Israeli wild emmer (Triticum dicoccoides) accession ""G-305-M"" into common wheat by crossing and backcrossing (G-305-M/781//Jing 411*3). Genetic analysis showed that the resistance was controlled by a single dominant gene at the seedling stage. Among the 102 pairs of SSR primers tested, four polymorphic microsatellite markers (Xpsp3029, Xpsp3071, Xpsp3152 and Xgwm570) from the long arm of chromosome 6A were mapped in a BC(2)F(3) population segregating for powdery mildew resistance and consisting of 167 plants. The genetic distances between the resistance gene and these four markers were: 0.6 cM to Xpsp3029, 3.1 cM to Xpsp3071, 11.2 cM to Xpsp3152 and 20.4 cM to Xgwm570, respectively. The order of these microsatellite loci agreed well with the established microsatellite map of chromosome arm 6AL. We concluded that the resistance gene was located on the long arm of chromosome 6AL. Based on the origin and chromosomal location of the gene, it is suggested that the resistance gene derived from ""G-305-M"" is a novel powdery mildew resistance gene and is temporarily designated MlG."

"19471905","abstracttext","Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f. sp. tritici is an important wheat disease in China and other parts of the world. Wild emmer (Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides) is the immediate progenitor of cultivated tetraploid and hexaploid wheats and thus an important resource for wheat improvement. Wild emmer accession IW2 collected from Mount Hermon, Israel, is highly resistant to powdery mildew at the seedling and adult plant stages. Genetic analysis using an F(2) segregating population and F(2:3) families, derived from a cross between susceptible durum cultivar Langdon and wild emmer accession IW2, indicated that a single dominant gene was responsible for the resistance of IW2. Bulked segregant and molecular marker analyses detected that six polymorphic SSR, one ISBP, and three EST-STS markers on chromosome 3BL bin 0.63-1.00 were linked to the resistance gene. Allelic variations of resistance-linked EST-STS marker BE489472 revealed that the allele was present only in wild emmer but absent in common wheat. Segregation distortion was observed for the powdery mildew resistance allele and its linked SSR markers with preferential transmission of Langdon alleles over IW2 alleles. The resistance gene was introgressed into common wheat by backcrossing and marker-assisted selection. Since no designated powdery mildew resistance gene has been found on chromosome 3BL, the resistance gene derived from wild emmer accession IW2 appears to be new one and was consequently designated Pm41."

"23110316","abstracttext","Rust fungi are destructive plant pathogens. The draft genomes of several wheat-infecting species have been released and potential pathogenicity genes identified through comparative analyses to fungal pathogens that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Functional gene analysis tools are needed to understand the infection process of these obligate parasites and to confirm whether predicted pathogenicity genes could become targets for disease control. We have modified an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated in planta-induced transient gene silencing (PITGS) assay for use in Triticum spp. (wheat), and used this assay to target predicted wheat leaf rust fungus, Puccinia triticina (Pt) pathogenicity genes, a MAP kinase (PtMAPK1), a cyclophilin (PtCYC1) and calcineurin B (PtCNB), to analyze their roles in disease. Agroinfiltration effectively delivered hairpin silencing constructs in wheat, leading to the generation of fungal gene-specific siRNA molecules in infiltrated leaves, and resulting in up to 70% reduction in transcription of the endogenous target genes in superinfected Pt. In vivo silencing caused severe disease suppression, compromising fungal growth and sporulation, as viewed by confocal microscopy and measured by reductions in fungal biomass and emergence of uredinia. Interestingly, using the same gene constructs, suppression of infection by Puccinia graminis and Puccinia striiformis was also achieved. Our results show that A. tumefaciens-mediated PITGS can be used as a reverse-genetics tool to discover gene function in rust fungi. This proof-of-concept study indicates that the targeted fungal transcripts might be important in pathogenesis, and could potentially be used as promising targets for developing RNA interference-based resistance against rust fungi."

We overlayed the gene expression results onto the co-expression network. We further provided network comparison analysis for orthologous genes across the diploid and allotetraploid Gossypium We also constructed miRNA-target networks and predicted PPI networks for both cotton species. Furthermore, we integrated in-house ChIP-seq data of histone modification (H3K4me3) together with cis-element analysis and gene sets enrichment analysis tools for studying possible gene regulatory mechanism in Gossypium species. Finally, we have constructed an online ccNET database (http://structuralbiology.cau.edu.cn/gossypium) for comparative gene functional analyses at a multi-dimensional network and epigenomic level across diploid and polyploid Gossypium species. The ccNET database will be beneficial for community to yield novel insights into gene/module functions during cotton development and stress response, and might be useful for studying conservation and diversity in other polyploid plants, such as T. aestivum and Brassica napus."

"19856114","abstracttext","The B-hordein gene family was analyzed from two Tibetan hull-less barley cultivars Z09 and Z26 (Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare). Fourteen B-hordein genes, designated BZ09-2 to BZ09-5 (from Z09) and BZ26-1 to BZ26-10 (from Z26), were sequenced. Seven of them, similar to a previously reported BZ09-1 from Z09, were predicted to encode putative active proteins each with a signal peptide, a repetitive domain, and a C-terminal region; seven of them were predicted to be pseudogenes. The B-hordein gene family was analyzed using all known representatives of B-hordein sequences and two most similar LMW-GSs of Triticum aestivum. Alignment of these seven putative proteins with known B-hordeins and two most similar LMW-GSs of T. aestivum revealed that they shared a common motif. A large variation was observed between numbers of repeat units of predicted B-hordeins of Z26 and Z09. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all BZ26 clones were clustered in a subgroup, and BZ09-1 formed another subgroup by itself in the putative eight active genes. In addition, six 5'-upstream regulatory sequences of the B-hordein genes were isolated from the two accessions by a single oligonucleotide nested PCR, and several different mutations were identified in the cis-acting element GLM and two distinctive sequences (Z09P-2 and Z26P-3). Phylogenetic analysis of 5'-upstream regulatory regions of the B-hordein genes showed that members from the same accession were clustered together except for two distinct members. Quantitative real time PCR analysis indicated distinct expression levels of B-hordein genes in four developing stages of developing grains in two accessions. These findings suggest B-hordein genes have intrinsic differences between accessions, and this knowledge will be useful for incorporating the B-hordeins protein in barley breeding programs."
"21660471","articletitle","Molecular and physiological strategies to increase aluminum resistance in plants."
"21660471","abstracttext","Aluminum (Al) toxicity is a primary limitation to plant growth on acid soils. Root meristems are the first site for toxic Al accumulation, and therefore inhibition of root elongation is the most evident physiological manifestation of Al toxicity. Plants may resist Al toxicity by avoidance (Al exclusion) and/or tolerance mechanisms (detoxification of Al inside the cells). The Al exclusion involves the exudation of organic acid anions from the root apices, whereas tolerance mechanisms comprise internal Al detoxification by organic acid anions and enhanced scavenging of free oxygen radicals. One of the most important advances in understanding the molecular events associated with the Al exclusion mechanism was the identification of the ALMT1 gene (Al-activated malate transporter) in Triticum aestivum root cells, which codes for a plasma membrane anion channel that allows efflux of organic acid anions, such as malate, citrate or oxalate. On the other hand, the scavenging of free radicals is dependent on the expression of genes involved in antioxidant defenses, such as peroxidases (e.g. in Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum), catalases (e.g. in Capsicum annuum), and the gene WMnSOD1 from T. aestivum. However, other recent findings show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) induced stress may be due to acidic (low pH) conditions rather than to Al stress. In this review, we summarize recent findings regarding molecular and physiological mechanisms of Al toxicity and resistance in higher plants. Advances have been made in understanding some of the underlying strategies that plants use to cope with Al toxicity. Furthermore, we discuss the physiological and molecular responses to Al toxicity, including genes involved in Al resistance that have been identified and characterized in several plant species. The better understanding of these strategies and mechanisms is essential for improving plant performance in acidic, Al-toxic soils."

Primer OPV20 produced a 2,000 base pair (bp) reproducible fragment only in the resistant near-isogenic line. The 2,000-bp DNA fragment was present in all other introgression lines containing Pm6. Using the F2 mapping population from a cross of IGVI-463 (PI170914/7*Prins) x Prins, Pm6 was shown to be closely linked to the marker OPV20-2000 at a genetic distance of 3.0 +/- 2.2 cM.

"20080432","abstracttext","Hybrids such as maize (Zea mays) or domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris) grow bigger and stronger than their parents. This is also true for allopolyploids such as wheat (Triticum spp.) or frog (i.e. Xenopus and Silurana) that contain two or more sets of chromosomes from different species. The phenomenon, known as hybrid vigor or heterosis, was systematically characterized by Charles Darwin (1876). The rediscovery of heterosis in maize a century ago has revolutionized plant and animal breeding and production. Although genetic models for heterosis have been rigorously tested, the molecular bases remain elusive. Recent studies have determined the roles of nonadditive gene expression, small RNAs, and epigenetic regulation, including circadian-mediated metabolic pathways, in hybrid vigor, which could lead to better use and exploitation of the increased biomass and yield in hybrids and allopolyploids for food, feed, and biofuels."

"24162500","abstracttext","Targeted homoeologous recombination mediated by the absence of the Ph1 locus is currently the most efficient technique by which foreign genes can be introgressed into polyploid wheat species. Because intra-arm homoeologous double cross-overs are rare, introgressed foreign genes are usually on terminal foreign chromosome segments. Since the minimum length of such a segment is determined by the position of a gene in the chromosome, large chromosome segments with undesirable genetic effects are often introgressed. Introgression of foreign genes on short interstitial segments based on two cycles of homoeologous recombination is described here. The utility of the technique is demonstrated by the introgression of the Kna1 locus, which controls K(+)/Na(+) selectivity in T. aesivum L., on short interstitial segments of chromosome 4D into chromosome 4B of Triticum turgidum L. The level of recombination in a homoeologous segment is not significantly affected by a juxtaposed proximal homologous segment in the absence of the Ph1 locus."

"24012818","abstracttext","High-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GSs) are of considerable interest, because they play a crucial role in determining dough viscoelastic properties and end-use quality of wheat flour. In this paper, ChAy/Bx, a novel chimeric HMW-GS gene from Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides (AABB, 2n=4x=28) accession D129, was isolated and characterized. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis revealed that the electrophoretic mobility of the glutenin subunit encoded by ChAy/Bx was slightly faster than that of 1Dy12. The complete ORF of ChAy/Bx contained 1,671 bp encoding a deduced polypeptide of 555 amino acid residues (or 534 amino acid residues for the mature protein), making it the smallest HMW-GS gene known from Triticum species. Sequence analysis showed that ChAy/Bx was neither a conventional x-type nor a conventional y-type subunit gene, but a novel chimeric gene. Its first 1305 nt sequence was highly homologous with the corresponding sequence of 1Ay type genes, while its final 366 nt sequence was highly homologous with the corresponding sequence of 1Bx type genes. The mature ChAy/Bx protein consisted of the N-terminus of 1Ay type subunit (the first 414 amino acid residues) and the C-terminus of 1Bx type subunit (the final 120 amino acid residues). Secondary structure prediction showed that ChAy/Bx contained some domains of 1Ay subunit and some domains of 1Bx subunit. The special structure of this HMW glutenin chimera ChAy/Bx subunit might have unique effects on the end-use quality of wheat flour. Here we propose that homoeologous recombination might be a novel pathway for allelic variation or molecular evolution of HMW-GSs."

"19088814","abstracttext","Association mapping (AM) is an alternative or complementary strategy to QTL mapping for describing associations between genotype and phenotype based on linkage disequilibrium (LD). Yellow pigment (YP), an important end-use quality trait in durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum), was evaluated to determine the ability of AM to identify previously published QTL and to identify genomic regions for further genetic dissection. The YP concentration was determined for 93 durum wheat accessions sampled from a variety of geographic origins. Analysis of population structure using distance- and model-based estimates indicated the presence of five subpopulations. Using subpopulation assignments as covariates, significant (P < 0.05) marker-trait associations for YP were detected on all chromosomes of the durum genome. Using AM, genomic regions housing known YP QTL were confirmed, most notably the group 7 chromosomes. In addition, several markers on the group 1, 2, and 3 chromosomes were identified where QTL have yet to be reported. A phytoene synthase gene, Psy1-B1, a potential candidate gene for YP, was significantly associated with YP and was in strong LD with microsatellite markers on the distal end of 7BL. Our results demonstrated that AM complemented traditional QTL mapping techniques and identified novel QTL that should be the target of further genetic dissection."

This study was conducted to examine the genetic control of resistance to necrosis induced by P. tritici-repentis race 3 and to map resistance genes identified in tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum). A mapping population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed from a cross between the resistant genotype T. tur-gidum no. 283 (PI 352519) and the susceptible durum cv. Coulter. Based on the reactions of the Langdon-T. dicoccoides (LDN[DIC]) disomic substitution lines, chromosomal location of the resistance genes was determined and further molecular mapping of the resistance genes for race 3 was conducted in 80 RILs of the cross T. turgidum no. 283/Coulter. Plants were inoculated at the two-leaf stage and disease reaction was assessed 8 days after inoculation based on lesion type. Disease reaction of the LDN(DIC) lines and molecular mapping on the T. turgidum no. 283/Coulter population indicated that the gene, designated tsn2, conditioning resistance to race 3 is located on the long arm of chromosome 3B. Genetic analysis of the F(2) generation and of the F(4:5) and F(6:7) families indicated that a single recessive gene controlled resistance to necrosis induced by race 3 in the cross studied."

The cultivar Creso is a shortstrawed variety carrying the Gai 1 gene on chromosome 4A, which influences both plant height and insensitivity to applied gibberellins. The main conclusions are as follows: 1) coleoptile elongation growth appears to be modulated via the fluencerate-dependent action of a blue-light receptor and via a low energy response of phytochrome; 2) the inhibition of first-foliage-leaf growth depends on the operation of a single blue-light-responsive photoreceptor; 3) high energy blue light produces the same inhibitory effect on the two wheat cultivars, whereas at relatively low fluences of white and blue light, the cultivar Creso is more sensitive; 4) the insensitivity to applied GA3 exerted by the gene Gai 1 in Creso is independent of light; 5) in Cappelli, the action of light on coleoptiles appears to be independent of the applied GA3, whereas the hormone is able to change the pattern of growth inhibition of the first-foliage-leaf."

"18470188","abstracttext","Temperature sweep gel electrophoresis in combination with random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis was employed to detect two markers for a single gene governing low cadmium uptake in western Canadian durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum). Analysis of progeny derived from a cross of the high cadmium accumulating cultivar Kyle by the low cadmium accumulating cultivar Nile resulted in linkage estimates of 4.6 (OPC-20) and 21.2 (UBC-180) cM. The closest marker (OPC-20) was shown to be useful for making low cadmium uptake selections from two other sources of low cadmium, 'Biodur' and 'Hercules'. The marker was further used to determine the genetic basis of resistance in 20 introduced durum wheat lines. Within this diverse range of germplasm the marker was correlated with cadmium contents as expected in all but two cases. Plant breeding selection for low cadmium genotypes is hindered by the high cost of chemical determination of cadmium content. Marker assisted selection for a low cadmium uptake gene offers an effective alternative."

It has already been documented that some of them play important roles in plant productivity. The presented research is the first step of comprehensive characterization of the bread wheat TaCKX gene family with the goal to select genes determining yield-related traits. The specificity of expression patterns of fifteen formerly annotated members of the TaCKX family was tested in different organs during wheat development. Based on this, the genes were assigned to four groups: TaCKX10, TaCKX5 and TaCKX4, highly specific to leaves; TaCKX3, TaCKX6 and TaCKX11, expressed in various levels through all the organs tested; TaCKX1, TaCKX2.3, TaCKX2.2, TaCKX2.1, TaCKX2.4 and TaCKX2.5 specific to developing spikes and inflorescences; TaCKX9, TaCKX8 and TaCKX7, highly specific to roots. Amplification products of tested genes were mapped to the chromosomes of the A, B or D genome using T. aestivum Ensembl Plants. Based on analysis of TaCKX transcripts as well as encoded amino acids in T. aestivum and Hordeum vulgare the number of CKX genes in wheat was limited to 11 and new numbering of selected TaCKX genes was proposed. Moreover, we found that there were developmental differences in expression of TaCKX in the first and the second spike and expression of some of the genes was daily time dependent. A very high and significant correlation was found between expression levels of TaCKX7 and TaCKX9, genes specific to seedling roots, TaCKX1, TaCKX2.1 and TaCKX2.2, specific to developing spikes, and the group of TaCKX3, 4, 5, 6, 10 and 11, highly expressed in leaves and other organs. The genes also co-operated among organs and were included in two groups representing younger or maturating stages of developing plants. The first group was represented by seedling roots, leaves from 4-week old plants, inflorescences and 0 DAP spikes; the second by developing spikes, 0 DAP, 7 DAP and 14 DAP. The key genes which might determine yield-related traits are indicated and their possible roles in breeding strategies are discussed."

"24270332","abstracttext","The genomes of the diploid wheats Triticum boeoticum and T. urartu are closely related, giving 7II in the f1 hybrid (T(b)T(u)) and 8.4 (0-14) II + 2.5 (0-7) IV in the derived amphiploid (T(b)T(b)T(u)T(u)). The genomes of the tetraploid wheats are also closely related, giving up to 7II at the polyhaploid level (AB) in the absence of the gene Ph but 14II at the tetraploid level (AABB) in the normal presence of Ph. If the amphiploid is the progenitor of the tetraploids, one or the other homoeologue (T(b) or T(u)) in each of the 7 homoeologous groups (the 7 potential IV) must have differentiated with respect to pairing affinity in order to account for 14II in the tetraploid. Consequently, in tetraploid X amphiploid hybrids (T(b)T(u)AB) carrying the Ph gene from the tetraploid, the seven differentiated chromosomes (B) would be expected to give 7I while, on the basis of their observed chiasma frequency, T(b), T(u) and the less differentiated A would be expected to give 4.17I + 3.57II + 3.23III), assuming homoeologous pairing. The expected chromosomal configuration freqencies at MI (11.17I + 3.57II + 3.23III) closely fit the observed values (11.22I + 3.45II + 3.19III + 0.071IV) for such hybrids (X(2) = 0.0046; P>0.99). Thus diploidization of the boeoticum-urartu amphiploid clearly could account for the origin of the tetraploid wheats. Furthermore, T. aestivum X amphiploid hybrids (T(b)T(u)ABD) with and without Ph indicated that B as well as A chomosomes tended to pair with their presumed T(b)T(u) homologues in the absence of Ph. Other tests showed that the tetraploid wheats could not plausibly have originated from any postulated Triticum-Sitopsis (TTSS) parental combinations with or without such chromosomal differentiation."

"30866466","abstracttext","Red coleoptiles can help crops to cope with adversity and the key genes that are responsible for this trait have previously been isolated from Triticum aestivum , Triticum urartu , and Aegilops tauschii . This report describes the use of transcriptome analysis to determine the candidate gene that controls the trait for white coleoptiles in T. monococcum by screening three cultivars with white coleoptiles and two with red coleoptiles. Fifteen structural genes and two transcription factors that are involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were identified from the assembled UniGene database through BLAST analysis and their transcript levels were then compared in white and red coleoptiles. The majority of the structural genes reflected lower transcript levels in the white than in the red coleoptiles, which implied that transcription factors related to anthocyanin biosynthesis could be candidate genes. The transcript levels of MYC transcription factor TmMYC-A1 were not significantly different between the white and red coleoptiles and all of the TmMYC-A1s contained complete functional domains. The deduced amino acid sequence of the MYB transcription factor TmMYB-A1 in red coleoptiles was homologous to TuMYB-A1, TaMYB-A1, TaMYB-B1, and TaMYB-D1, which control coleoptile color in corresponding species and contained the complete R2R3 MYB domain and the transactivation domain. TmMYB-a1 lost its two functional domains in white coleoptiles due to a single nucleotide deletion that caused premature termination at 13 bp after the initiation codon. Therefore, TmMYB-A1 is likely to be the candidate gene for the control of the red coleoptile trait, and its loss-of-function mutation leads to the white phenotype in T. monococcum ."

"18392800","abstracttext","Powdery mildew, caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp. tritici, is one of the most important wheat diseases in many regions of the world. Triticum turgidum var. dicoccoides (2n=4x=AABB), the progenitor of cultivated wheats, shows particular promises as a donor of useful genetic variation for several traits, including disease resistances. The wild emmer accession MG29896, resistant to powdery mildew, was backcrossed to the susceptible durum wheat cultivar Latino, and a set of backcross inbred lines (BC(5)F(5)) was produced. Genetic analysis of F(3) populations from two resistant introgression lines (5BIL-29 x Latino and 5BIL-42 x Latino) indicated that the powdery mildew resistance is controlled by a single dominant gene. Molecular markers and the bulked segregant analysis were used to characterize and map the powdery mildew resistance. Five AFLP markers (XP43M32((250)), XP46M31((410)), XP41M37((100)), XP41M39((250)), XP39M32((120))), three genomic SSR markers (Xcfd07, Xwmc75, Xgwm408) and one EST-derived SSR marker (BJ261635) were found to be linked to the resistance gene in 5BIL-29 and only the BJ261635 marker in 5BIL-42. By means of Chinese Spring nullisomic-tetrasomic, ditelosomic and deletion lines, the polymorphic markers and the resistance gene were assigned to chromosome bin 5BL6-0.29-0.76. These results indicated that the two lines had the same resistance gene and that the introgressed dicoccoides chromosome segment was longer (35.5 cM) in 5BIL-29 than that introgressed in 5BIL-42 (less than 1.5 cM). As no powdery mildew resistance gene has been reported on chromosome arm 5BL, the novel resistance gene derived from var. dicoccoides was designated Pm36. The 244 bp allele of BJ261635 in 5BIL-42 can be used for marker-assisted selection during the wheat resistance breeding process for facilitating gene pyramiding."

"22690376","abstracttext","The transfer of alien genes to crop plants using chromosome engineering has been attempted infrequently in tetraploid durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. subsp. durum). Here, we report a highly efficient approach for the transfer of two genes conferring resistance to stem rust race Pgt-TTKSK (Ug99) from goatgrass (Aegilops speltoides) to tetraploid wheat. The durum line DAS15, carrying the stem rust resistance gene Sr47 derived from Ae. speltoides, was crossed, and backcrossed, to durum 5D(5B) aneuploids to induce homeologous pairing. After a final cross to 'Rusty' durum, allosyndetic recombinants were recovered. The Ae. speltoides chromosomal segment carrying Sr47 was found to have two stem rust resistance genes. One gene conditioning an infection type (IT) 2 was located in the same chromosomal region of 2BS as Sr39 and was assigned the temporary gene symbol SrAes7t. Based on ITs observed on a diverse set of rust races, SrAes7t may be the same as Sr39. The second gene conditioned an IT 0; and was located on chromosome arm 2BL. This gene retained the symbol Sr47 because it had a different IT and map location from other stem rust resistance genes derived from Ae. speltoides. Allosyndetic recombinant lines carrying each gene on minimal alien chromosomal segments were identified as were molecular markers distinguishing each alien segment. This study demonstrated that chromosome engineering of Ae. speltoides segments is feasible in tetraploid wheat. The Sr47 gene confers high-level and broad spectrum resistance to stem rust and should be very useful in efforts to control TTKSK."

"19220786","abstracttext","Drought is the major factor limiting wheat productivity worldwide. The gene pool of wild emmer wheat, Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides, harbours a rich allelic repertoire for morpho-physiological traits conferring drought resistance. The genetic and physiological bases of drought responses were studied here in a tetraploid wheat population of 152 recombinant inbreed lines (RILs), derived from a cross between durum wheat (cv. Langdon) and wild emmer (acc# G18-16), under contrasting water availabilities. Wide genetic variation was found among RILs for all studied traits. A total of 110 quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were mapped for 11 traits, with LOD score range of 3.0-35.4. Several QTLs showed environmental specificity, accounting for productivity and related traits under water-limited (20 QTLs) or well-watered conditions (15 QTLs), and in terms of drought susceptibility index (22 QTLs). Major genomic regions controlling productivity and related traits were identified on chromosomes 2B, 4A, 5A and 7B. QTLs for productivity were associated with QTLs for drought-adaptive traits, suggesting the involvement of several strategies in wheat adaptation to drought stress. Fifteen pairs of QTLs for the same trait were mapped to seemingly homoeologous positions, reflecting synteny between the A and B genomes. The identified QTLs may facilitate the use of wild alleles for improvement of drought resistance in elite wheat cultivars."

"24085801","abstracttext","The activation of the meristem identity gene VERNALIZATION1 (VRN1) is a critical regulatory point in wheat (Triticum spp.) flowering. In photoperiod-sensitive wheat varieties, VRN1 is expressed only under long days (LDs), but mutants carrying deletions in a regulatory element in its promoter show VRN1 transcription and early spike development under short days (SDs). However, complete spike development is delayed until plants are transferred to LDs, indicating the existence of an additional regulatory mechanism dependent on LDs. We show here that exogenous gibberellin (GA) application accelerates spike development under SDs, but only in wheat lines expressing VRN1. The simultaneous presence of GA and VRN1 results in the up-regulation of the floral meristem identity genes SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-1 and LEAFY, whereas inhibition of GA biosynthesis with paclobutrazol precludes the LD induction of these two genes. The inductive role of GA on wheat flowering is further supported by the up-regulation of GA biosynthetic genes in the apices of plants transferred from SDs to LDs and in photoperiod-insensitive and transgenic wheat plants with increased FLOWERING LOCUS T transcription under SDs. The up-regulation of GA biosynthetic genes was not observed in the leaves of the same genetic stocks. Based on these observations, we propose a model in which FLOWERING LOCUS T is up-regulated in the leaves under LDs and is then transported to the shoot apical meristem, where it simultaneously induces the expression of VRN1 and GA biosynthetic genes, which are both required for the up-regulation of the early floral meristem genes SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1-1 and LEAFY and the timely development of the wheat spike."

"26884094","abstracttext_background","Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) is a cereal crop widely grown in the Mediterranean regions; the amber grain is mainly used for the production of pasta, couscous and typical breads. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) detection technologies and high-throughput mutation induction represent a new challenge in wheat breeding to identify allelic variation in large populations. The TILLING strategy makes use of traditional chemical mutagenesis followed by screening for single base mismatches to identify novel mutant loci. Although TILLING has been combined to several sensitive pre-screening methods for SNP analysis, most rely on expensive equipment. Recently, a new low cost and time saving DHPLC protocol has been used in molecular human diagnostic to detect unknown mutations."
"26884094","abstracttext_results","In this work, we developed a new durum wheat TILLING population (cv. Marco Aurelio) using 0.70-0.85% ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS). To investigate the efficiency of the mutagenic treatments, a pilot screening was carried out on 1,140 mutant lines focusing on two target genes (Lycopene epsilon-cyclase, ε-LCY, and Lycopene beta-cyclase, β-LCY) involved in carotenoid metabolism in wheat grains. We simplify the heteroduplex detection by two low cost methods: the enzymatic cleavage (CelI)/agarose gel technique and the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC). The CelI/agarose gel approach allowed us to identify 31 mutations, whereas the DHPLC procedure detected a total of 46 mutations for both genes. All detected mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. The estimated overall mutation frequency for the pilot assay by the DHPLC methodology resulted to be of 1/77 kb, representing a high probability to detect interesting mutations in the target genes."
"26884094","abstracttext_conclusion","We demonstrated the applicability and efficiency of a new strategy for the detection of induced variability. We produced and characterized a new durum wheat TILLING population useful for a better understanding of key gene functions. The availability of this tool together with TILLING technique will expand the polymorphisms in candidate genes of agronomically important traits in wheat."
"27144898","articletitle","Mapping-by-sequencing in complex polyploid genomes using genic sequence capture: a case study to map yellow rust resistance in hexaploid wheat."
"27144898","abstracttext","Previously we extended the utility of mapping-by-sequencing by combining it with sequence capture and mapping sequence data to pseudo-chromosomes that were organized using wheat-Brachypodium synteny. This, with a bespoke haplotyping algorithm, enabled us to map the flowering time locus in the diploid wheat Triticum monococcum L. identifying a set of deleted genes (Gardiner et al., 2014). Here, we develop this combination of gene enrichment and sliding window mapping-by-synteny analysis to map the Yr6 locus for yellow stripe rust resistance in hexaploid wheat. A 110 MB NimbleGen capture probe set was used to enrich and sequence a doubled haploid mapping population of hexaploid wheat derived from an Avalon and Cadenza cross. The Yr6 locus was identified by mapping to the POPSEQ chromosomal pseudomolecules using a bespoke pipeline and algorithm (Chapman et al., 2015). Furthermore the same locus was identified using newly developed pseudo-chromosome sequences as a mapping reference that are based on the genic sequence used for sequence enrichment. The pseudo-chromosomes allow us to demonstrate the application of mapping-by-sequencing to even poorly defined polyploidy genomes where chromosomes are incomplete and sub-genome assemblies are collapsed. This analysis uniquely enabled us to: compare wheat genome annotations; identify the Yr6 locus - defining a smaller genic region than was previously possible; associate the interval with one wheat sub-genome and increase the density of SNP markers associated. Finally, we built the pipeline in iPlant, making it a user-friendly community resource for phenotype mapping."
